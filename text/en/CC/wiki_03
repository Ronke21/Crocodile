<text>Stephen Douglas Owen (September 8, 1948 – June 29, 2023) was a Canadian lawyer, administrator and politician. From 2000 to 2007 he served as Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Vancouver Quadra, encompassing the western end of the City of Vancouver. As part of the Liberal Party of Canada caucus, he was a member of Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s government, serving in cabinet as Minister of Public Works and Government Services from 2003 to 2004, and as Minister of Western Economic Diversification and Minister of State for Sport from 2004 to 2006. He left parliament to join the University of British Columbia (UBC) as the vice-president of External, Legal and Community Relations, serving in that role until 2012.

==Early life and career==
Born in Vancouver on September 8, 1948, Owen attended Shawnigan Lake School on Vancouver Island before studying at UBC, graduating with a law degree in 1972. He went on to receive an LL.M. from University College London/University of London in 1974, and an MBA from the International Management Institute at the University of Geneva in 1986. In 1975 he began a two-year assignment with Canadian University Service Overseas teaching high school in Nigeria, before returning to Canada in 1977 to work as a staff lawyer with the legal aid office in Surrey, eventually becoming executive director of the Legal Services Society of British Columbia.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Owen worked for the government of British Columbia as a non-partisan official. He served as that province&#x27;s ombudsman from 1986 to 1992, and as Commissioner for the ground-breaking Commission on Resources and Environment, which pioneered the province&#x27;s multi-stakeholder land-use planning approach, from 1992 to 1995. After serving as Deputy Attorney General for B.C. from 1995 to 1997, he joined the University of Victoria as David Lam Professor of Law and Public Policy, and director of the university&#x27;s Institute for Dispute Resolution. He concurrently served as commissioner and vice-president of the Law Commission of Canada from 1997 to 2000.

==Federal politics==
Owen ran as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Quadra at the 2000 federal election, defeating Kerry-Lynne Findlay of the Canadian Alliance to become the riding&#x27;s Member of Parliament. He was appointed Secretary of State for both Western Economic Diversification and Indian Affairs and Northern Development by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien on January 15, 2002. On December 12, 2003, Owen was promoted by the newly appointed Martin to Minister of Public Works and Government Services. In this capacity, he was a frequent target of opposition questions on the &quot;sponsorship scandal&quot;. During his tenure, Owen was involved in the recovery of misappropriated public funds from Hewlett-Packard; the company paid C$146 million to the government of Canada, and both parties agreed to jointly pursue companies who may also have been involved.

Owen defeated former provincial cabinet minister and Conservative candidate Stephen Rogers in the federal election of 2004, receiving 52% of the vote compared to Rogers&#x27; 26%. He was named Minister of Western Economic Diversification and Minister of State for Sport on July 20, 2004. Under normal circumstances, this would have been considered a demotion, but the shuffle placed Owen in a powerful managerial position for preparation for the upcoming Winter Olympics in British Columbia.

During the federal election of 2006, held to elect the 39th Parliament, Owen again defeated Rogers and maintained his seat in Vancouver Quadra. With the Liberals becoming the Official Opposition, Owen was named critic for democratic reform. Following the election, Owen endorsed Michael Ignatieff for the Liberal Party leadership to replace the outgoing Paul Martin.

Owen resigned his seat on July 27, 2007, to become UBC&#x27;s vice-president of External, Legal and Community Relations, finishing his five-year term in 2012.

==Personal life==
Owen married his wife Diane in 1971; the couple had two sons together. His cousin Philip Owen is a former mayor of Vancouver, and uncle Walter Stewart Owen served as Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia from 1973 to 1978. 

Owen died at a care home in Vancouver on June 29, 2023, at age 74. He had dementia in the years leading up to his death.

<text>KIKU (channel 20) is an independent television station in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, which primarily airs Japanese and Filipino programming. It is owned by Allen Media Group alongside ABC affiliate KITV (channel 4). The two stations share studios on South King Street in downtown Honolulu; KIKU&#x27;s transmitter is located in Nānākuli.

Channel 20 in Honolulu went on air in December 1983 as KHAI-TV. Though built and originally owned by Tennessee-based Media Central, it has specialized in Asian programming for nearly its entire history. International Channel Network acquired KHAI-TV in 1989 as part of Media Central&#x27;s bankruptcy. JN Productions took over operations in 1993 and changed the station&#x27;s call sign to KIKU; its owner, Joanne Ninomiya, had been the general manager of channel 13 when that station was Japanese-language KIKU-TV. JN continued to supply Japanese-language programming for KIKU until 2004. UPN programming aired on channel 20 from 2004 to the network&#x27;s closure in 2006. In addition, the station produced local programming, some of which was aimed at the Vietnamese and Filipino communities in Hawaii.

After passing through a number of owners including AsianMedia Group and NRJ TV, WRNN-TV Associates acquired the station in 2019. As part of a group affiliation agreement, KIKU converted to the home shopping network ShopHQ in June 2021, a switch met with outcry and dismay by Hawaii viewers. Allen Media Group acquired KIKU in 2022 and immediately restored its prior program format, augmented by English-language syndicated programs and local newscasts from KITV.

==KIKU on channel 13==
The call sign KIKU first was associated with Japanese-language television in Honolulu in 1967, when Richard Eaton bought KTRG-TV (channel 13) from David Watumull and renamed it KIKU-TV ( being the Japanese word for the chrysanthemum flower). His announced plans to make channel 13 a primarily Japanese-language station had led to scrutiny of the transaction by the Federal Communications Commission; during this time, the station&#x27;s intended general manager programmed two hours a week of Japanese-language shows. By 1967, the station programmed entirely in Japanese.

In 1968, it began nightly telecasts of sumo wrestling. The station introduced English-language subtitles on its Japanese-language programs in 1970, which proved popular and expanded to having half of all programs subtitled by 1975. Another channel 13 specialty was children&#x27;s programming; it aired such programs as &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;, &quot;Rainbowman&quot;, and &quot;Android Kikaider&quot; (known in Hawaii as &quot;Kikaida&quot;). The success of the latter was particularly noteworthy; the show beat &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the ratings, and it was noted in an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. A station employee, Hideo Fujii, recalled that &quot;older people in the Nikkei community would sit up straight in bed and weep&quot; watching KIKU&#x27;s programs.

In 1979, KIKU-TV was sold by Eaton to Mid-Pacific Television Associates. The new ownership proposed to reduce the proportion of Japanese-language programming at the station. This prompted general manager Joanne Ninomiya, who had run channel 13 since 1969, to depart in January 1981; she then started her own company, JN Productions, to broadcast Japanese-language shows on cable. The new KIKU-TV ownership instituted a mostly English-language program lineup in June 1981. 

Under new general manager Rick Blangiardi, in 1984, KIKU-TV changed its call sign to KHNL. Ninomiya renewed her association with KHNL beginning in 1986, providing six hours of Japanese programs on Sundays as well as a daily newscast from Japan and subtitled sumo broadcasts.

==History==
===Construction===
In late 1978, a group of investors known as Sunset Communications Corporation was formed to file for channel 20. Sunset shared investors with Delta Television, a subsidiary of advertising firm Petry Television that had put WPTY-TV in Memphis, Tennessee, on air earlier that year. For one of the principals, John A. Serrao, it was a return to Hawaii, as he had been general manager of KHVH-TV (channel 4) in the early 1960s when it was owned by Kaiser Broadcasting. The channel 20 construction permit was granted on August 12, 1980.

The group sold the permit to Media Central of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1982; under Media Central, the station began broadcasting as KHAI-TV on December 30, 1983, with Japanese-language programming from the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It was the fifth station Media Central built during 1983. In addition to Japanese-language programming, the station added Filipino programming in 1986 and shows in Korean in March 1989. However, its broadcast day was limited. In 1986, the station switched from signing on at noon to beginning at 4 p.m. because Oceanic Cable, the dominant cable provider on Oahu, placed it on the same channel as The Discovery Channel.

===ICN/AsianMedia ownership===
In 1987, Media Central filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. KHAI was sold for $1.75 million to International Channel Network (ICN), which owned Los Angeles multicultural station KSCI, in 1989. ICN moved the station to new studios on Sand Island Access Road in 1991, built a new transmitter, and expanded its weekly broadcasting by 28 hours; more than half of the new airtime featured programming in Chinese.

ICN brokered the station&#x27;s airtime to JN Productions, the programming and subtitling company owned by Joanne Ninomiya, in 1993; JN began handling sales and programming duties. The first move made with the change in management was the consolidation of the cable programming from JN Productions as well as KHNL&#x27;s Japanese-language shows onto channel 20&#x27;s schedule. Ninomiya also changed the station&#x27;s call sign to KIKU.

KSCI and KIKU were sold in 2000 to a consortium of &quot;The Korea Times&quot; and private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners, known as AsianMedia Group. In 2004, JN Productions ceased providing programming functions for the station, though it continued to supply KIKU with subtitles for its Japanese-language programming; the station brought programming operations in-house. In 2007, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs honored Ninomiya with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Rays for contributing to &quot;introducing Japanese culture and promoting friendship between Japan and the United States&quot;. 

KIKU was the last of four stations to air UPN programming in Hawaii when it began airing the network&#x27;s programs on November 1, 2004. UPN programs were usually broadcast in the late afternoon, leaving Japanese-language shows in prime time. The original UPN affiliate had been KFVE; when it dropped UPN to emphasize The WB, KHON-TV and KGMB then split UPN programming. KIKU was the only Honolulu station that could provide a two-hour block to air UPN prime time programming. When The WB and UPN merged to form The CW in 2006, KIKU passed on the offering because The CW wanted prime time clearance for its programming. In addition to shows it purchased, KIKU produced local programming. This included short-form segments such as &quot;The Wisdom of Hawai‘i&#x27;s Elders&quot;, &quot;Japanese Word of the Day&quot;, and &quot;Itadakimasu&quot;. Its output also included a local show in Vietnamese and another in English aimed at the Filipino community. For a time, it aired anime syndicated by the Funimation Channel, making it the service&#x27;s first non-cable affiliate; KIKU broadcast dubbed versions of select shows every weekday from 6 to 7 p.m. and 10 to 11 p.m.

KIKU discontinued analog broadcasting on January 15, 2009, the date on which full-power television stations in Hawaii transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts. The transition in Hawaii had been brought forward from the original February 17 national switch date—itself later delayed to June—because of concern that the dismantling of existing transmitter towers atop Haleakalā on Maui would affect the mating season of the endangered Hawaiian petrel, which begins in February. KIKU continued to broadcast on its pre-transition channel 19, using virtual channel 20. 

In January 2012, AsianMedia Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; the station, along with KSCI in Los Angeles and its San Diego repeater KUAN-LP, was sold to NRJ TV (a company unrelated to European broadcaster NRJ Radio) for $45 million in March 2012, in a transaction that included the assumption of AsianMedia Group&#x27;s debt.

===Sale to WRNN-TV Associates; home shopping programming===

On December 9, 2019, WRNN-TV Associates announced it would purchase NRJ&#x27;s TV stations; the acquisition received FCC approval in January 2020 and was completed the next month. WRNN-TV Associates continued the Asian format until announcing in May 2021 that it would affiliate all of the stations it owned with ShopHQ, a home shopping network, on June 28. For ShopHQ, this deal brought high-definition cable and satellite carriage on TV stations reaching more than 20 million homes in the major markets of New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Francisco, Houston, Washington, and Boston. The deal included KIKU; eight days later, the station announced that &quot;The Rumor Is True&quot; and that ShopHQ would displace all of KIKU&#x27;s existing programming. It also meant the closure of the KIKU studio in the Pacific Guardian Center, in part because ShopHQ programming did not include local advertising.

The change led to considerable outcry, including among older viewers that had watched the station for decades and were not necessarily fluent in English. Station manager Phyllis Kihara told &quot;Pacific Business News&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve been getting calls and emails and texts all day. When you look at Facebook, the messages people are leaving, we&#x27;re really sorry we&#x27;re going to lose this and I think that&#x27;s what the people of Hawaii feel like, too.&quot; Kihara went as far as to provide aggrieved viewers her direct contact information. Observers, including Ninomiya, noted that running a Japanese-language TV station carried with it significant costs for licensing programs and additional expenses and needed personnel skills to translate and subtitle them. While a variety of sources for Japanese- and Filipino-language programming, such as Nippon Golden Network, continued to be available, these were all pay services to which viewers may not have necessarily been able to subscribe. In advance of the change in format, KIKU scheduled episodes in such a way as to complete series, airing some shows twice a week or more.

===Sale to Allen Media Group===
Only three months after the change to ShopHQ, on September 27, 2021, it was announced that KIKU would be sold to Allen Media Broadcasting, owner of KITV, for $4,000,000. The sale was completed on January 31, 2022.

Allen immediately moved to restore much of the prior programming and format to KIKU. On January 31, KIKU returned to airing Japanese and Filipino programming, as well as local newscasts from KITV. It also added Entertainment Studios and other syndicated content to fill the schedule out further. The general manager of KITV said that KIKU&#x27;s new schedule would include about 75 percent of the programs the station had been airing prior to switching to ShopHQ, including some subtitled shows.

<doc id="845427" wikidata="Q59791" url="?curid=845427" title="Helictite">
<text>A helictite is a speleothem (cave-formed mineral) found in a limestone cave that changes its axis from the vertical at one or more stages during its growth. Helictites have a curving or angular form that looks as if they were grown in zero gravity. They are most likely the result of capillary forces acting on tiny water droplets, a force often strong enough at this scale to defy gravity.

Helictites are, perhaps, the most delicate of cave formations. They are usually made of needle-form calcite and aragonite. Helictite forms have been described in several types: ribbon helictites, saws, rods, butterflies, &quot;hands&quot;, curly-fries, and &quot;clumps of worms&quot;. They typically have radial symmetry. They can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, helictites are rarely seen within arm&#x27;s reach in tourist caves.

Timpanogos Cave National Monument in Utah has one of the largest collections of these formations in the world. Large numbers are also in the Jenolan Caves in Australia and in the Pozalagua Cave in Karrantza, Spain. A remarkable suite of helictites also occurs in Asperge Cave, France.
Can also be found in Black Chasm Cavern in California, USA.

== Formation ==
The growth of helictites is still quite enigmatic. To this day, there has been no satisfactory explanation for how they are formed. Currently, formation by capillary forces is the most likely hypothesis, but another hypothesis based on wind formation is also viable. 

=== Capillary forces ===
The most likely hypothesis explains helictites as a result of capillary forces. If the helictite has a very thin central tube where the water flows as it does in straws, capillary forces would be able to transport water against gravity. This idea was inspired by some hollow helictites. However, the majority of helictites are not hollow. Despite this, droplets can be drawn to the tips of existing structures and deposit their calcite load almost anywhere thereon. This can lead to the wandering and curling structures seen in many helictites.

===Wind===
Another hypothesis names the wind in the cave as the main reason for the strange appearance. Drops hanging on a stalactite are blown to one side, so the dripstone grows in that direction. If the wind changes, the direction of growth changes too. However, this hypothesis is very problematic, because wind directions change very often. The wind in caves depends on air pressure changes outside, which in turn depend on the weather. The wind direction changes as often as the weather conditions outside change. But the dripstones grow very slowly – several centimeters in 100 years – meaning that the wind direction would have to stay steady for long periods of time, changing for every fragment of a millimeter of growth. A second problem with this idea is that many caves with helictites have no natural entrance where wind could enter.

===Piezoelectric forces===
Another hypothesis that has been proposed is that slowly changing geological pressure causing stresses on the crystals at the base alters the piezo electrostatic potential and causes particle deposition to be oriented in some relationship to the prevailing pressure orientation.

===Bacterial===
A recent hypothesis, which is supported by observation, is that a prokaryotic bacterial film provides a nucleation site for mineralization process.

==Helictite growth==
A helictite starts its growth as a tiny stalactite. The direction of the end of the straw may wander, twist like a corkscrew, or the main part may form normally while small helictites pop out of its side like rootlets or fishhooks. In some caves, helictites cluster together and form bushes as large as six feet tall. These bushes grow from the floor of the cave. When helictites are found on cave floors, they are referred to as heligmites, though there is debate as to whether this is a genuine subcategory. 

For an unknown reason, when the chemical composition of the water is slightly altered, the single crystal structure can change from a cylindrical shape to a conical one. In some of these cases, each crystal fits into the prior one like an inverted stack of ice cream cones.

<text>The Texas Water Safari is a boat race down waterways from San Marcos, Texas, to Seadrift, Texas. The total distance traveled is 262 miles. Racers must take all equipment needed with them, receiving only medical supplies, food, water, and ice along the way. The primary requirement is a boat powered only by human muscle. The event was first held in 1963, and is run annually. The race begins on the second Saturday of June of each year, barring bad weather.

In 1962 Frank Brown and Bill &quot;Big Willie&quot; George navigated from San Marcos to Corpus Christi without a motor. In 1963 they created the Texas Water Safari which would become an annual race.

==Course==
The course includes natural rivers like the San Marcos, with rapids and dams. Most boats destroyed on the course are lost in the upper river. The San Marcos River converges with the Guadalupe River and becomes wider and slower. The main dangers in the middle river are sweepers, downed trees, logjams and dams. Near the end of the course there are lakes and swamps, and it ends with a crossing of the San Antonio Bay. Other challenges include alligators, sharks, water moccasin, fire ants, and mosquitos.

There are 11 checkpoints including the finish line. Their locations are published and they are staffed with officials. Each checkpoint has a cutoff time the racers must meet or be disqualified. The final cutoff time at the finish is 100 hours. The team captain of each team must be present at the checkpoint to sign off the team&#x27;s time as the team leaves. Checkpoints: 
*Staples Dam
*Luling 90
*Palmetto State Park
*Gonzales Dam
*Hochheim
*Cuero 766 (Cheapside)
*Cuero 236
*Victoria City Park
*Swinging Bridge (often referred to as Invista or Dupont)
*Calhoun Riverside RV Retreat
*Seadrift

==Records==
Athletes compete in classes. The Unlimited class has no restriction, except that the watercraft is powered only by human muscle, and restricted since 2006 to crews no greater than six. Attempts have been made to race craft of unconventional form, but the best results have been achieved by well-trained teams in crewboats.

<doc id="845444" wikidata="Q5546156" url="?curid=845444" title="George Wenige">
<text>George Albert Wenige (1874–1952) was an eccentric mayor of London, Ontario, Canada, who served nine terms, mostly non-consecutively.

Wenige (pronounced WHEN-igg) was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1874 and moved to London, Ontario, Canada as a stunt bicycle rider at the Western Fair in 1900. He liked the city and decided to stay, opening the Bicycle and Motor Sales Company. In 1915, a new shop was built, with Wenige insisting that it be completed in 30 days; he hired a brass band to motivate the workers. He claimed his shop &quot;made walking expensive&quot; and once bicycled from London to Halifax, Nova Scotia to promote his business.

Wenige was a populist and was well loved by London&#x27;s working class. He was elected alderman in 1921 and was elected to three consecutive terms as mayor from 1923 to 1925. In 1925, he attended the funeral of former mayor Sir Adam Beck, earning the scorn of London&#x27;s upper class by wearing a business suit and a straw hat -- &quot;the only hat I owned&quot;—he explained.

Wenige was elected mayor again in 1928, 1934, 1935, 1947, 1948 and 1950 (at the time, London elected its mayors for one year only). In 1935, he ran as an independent candidate in the federal election but lost. He also campaigned for mayor, and lost on nine other occasions, including 1952, when he lost to Allan Rush, the former chief of police whom Wenige had fired during his term in 1950. Wenige died shortly afterwards.

When the Ontario Department of Highways built Highway 126, a freeway linking London to Highway 401 in 1963, the City of London named the 360-metre section from Hamilton Road south to the Thames River the &quot;Wenige Expressway.&quot; The signs denoting this stretch of the road disappeared in the 1980s, and today it is known only as Highbury Avenue. In north London, he is commemorated by &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South Wenige Drive,&quot; and there have been proposals to rename London&#x27;s bicycle paths after him.

He is buried in Woodland Cemetery in London, Ontario.

<text>The Company of Cutlers in [[Hallamshire]] is a trade guild of metalworkers based in Sheffield, England. It was incorporated in 1624 by an act of Parliament. The head is called the Master Cutler. Its motto is .

In the original act of Parliament, the  (21 Jas. 1. c. 31), the company was given jurisdiction over:

This was expanded to include other trades by later acts, most notably steelmakers in 1860. In the same year the Company was given the right to veto any proposed name of a limited company anywhere in the United Kingdom which contains the word &quot;Sheffield&quot;. It also supplies marks to approved cutlers and promotes Sheffield steelware.

The company has been based at Cutlers&#x27; Hall (opposite the cathedral on Church Street) since 1638. The current hall is the third to have been built on the site. The second was built in 1725 and the third in 1832. It was extended in 1867 and 1888. It was listed a Grade II* listed building in 1973. It is used for formal functions and award ceremonies for local businesses.

Members of the company are called freemen and currently number 447. The Master Cutler is elected each year from the freemen within the company. He or she also has two wardens, six searchers and 24 assistants. The company also employs a clerk for administration and a beadle to perform ceremonial duties. Since 1625, the Company has held an annual feast, inviting prominent people in order to showcase Sheffield&#x27;s industry.

The Master Cutler for 2011–12 was Pamela Liversidge, the first woman to hold this position.

The Master Cutler for October 2017–2018 (the 379th) was Ken Cooke.

<text>Shturcite ( ; English &quot;The Crickets&quot;), sometimes romanized as Shturtsite, was a Bulgarian rock group. They were one of the most successful bands in Bulgaria during the 1970s and 1980s and still have many fans. The band broke up once in 1990, reformed in 1997, and disbanded again in 2013. The group has been characterized as &quot;Bulgaria&#x27;s answer to The Beatles&quot;.

== History ==
The group was created in 1967 in Sofia by Kiril Marichkov, Petar Tsankov (both from Bandaratsite group), Petar Gyuzelev, and Veselin Kisyov (both from Slănchevi Bratya group). Their first performance was at a students party in VITIZ (The Bulgarian School for Performing Arts), and in 1967 they made their first records. At first Georgi Minchev took part in the group, too, and with him they made their first success: the song &quot;Byala Tishina&quot; (&quot;Бяла тишина&quot;; &quot;White Silence&quot;) of the composer Boris Karadimchev, winning the national award of Zlatnia Orfey (&quot;Златния Орфей&quot;, the Golden Orpheus).

In 1968, the group issued their first EP containing the songs &quot;Veselina&quot; (&quot;Веселина&quot;, lyrics: Radoy Ralin), &quot;Zvăn&quot; (&quot;Звън&quot;; &quot;Ringing&quot;), &quot;Malkiat Svetăl Prozorets&quot; (&quot;Малкият светъл прозорец&quot;; &quot;Little Bright Window&quot;) and &quot;Izprashtane&quot; (&quot;Изпращане&quot;, &quot;Dispatch&quot;).

It was not until 1976 that they recorded their first homonymous LP with its hit single &quot;Day Mi Malko Nezhnost&quot; (&quot;Дай ми малко нежност&quot;; &quot;Give Me A Little Tenderness&quot;). Their second album &quot;Shturtsite &#x27;78&quot; two years later introduced band&#x27;s new keyboard player and singer, Valdi Totev. His influence took away the band far from its early pop sound to a new prog rock territory. The first song on the LP &quot;Nyakoi Ot Vas&quot; (&quot;Някои от вас&quot;; &quot;Some Of You&quot;) is their first leading album song not to be sung by lead vocalist Marichkov, but by the newcomer, Totev. Despite his influence on the band&#x27;s sound, Totev did not write a single song for the album.

In 1980, Shturtsite issued &quot;XX vek&quot; (20th Century), featuring the hits &quot;Dve sledi&quot;, the title track and &quot;Svatben den&quot;. Two years later, the double LP &quot;Vkusăt na vremeto&quot; (The Taste of Time) was issued, featuring many hits, such as the title track. The band spent the rest of the 1980s recording two new albums, &quot;Konnikăt&quot; and &quot;Musketarski marsh&quot;, released in 1985 and 1987. They then played a national tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary throughout 1987. Tracks from the concerts were edited together into a triple album called &quot;20 godini po-kusno&quot;, released in 1988.

In 1990, the band released their final single, &quot;Az săm prosto chovek&quot;, which became a popular anthem for Bulgarian democracy in the 1990s. They then broke up. Later that year, Balkanton released a compilation called &quot;The Crickets&quot;, which mainly consists of tracks from &quot;Musketarski marsh&quot; and also included a live version of the song &quot;XX vek&quot; (the recording is taken from &quot;20 godini po-kăsno&quot;). This was Shturtsite&#x27;s first official CD release and is one of only two issues of the &quot;20 godini po-kusno&quot; songs on CD (the other being &quot;Pesen za Shturtsite&quot; on &quot;1968–1980&quot;). All the text on &quot;The Crickets&quot; is in English (except for the copyright warning on the CD, which is written in English, French, German and Bulgarian) and features liner notes by a woman called Claire Levi. It and a similar compilation by fellow Bulgarian rock band FSB are the first two rock releases on CD in the Balkanton catalogue.

Six years later, the independent label GMP reissued most of their back catalogue (except for their two self-titled albums) on CD (albeit issuing a cut-down 13 track version of &quot;Vkusăt na vremeto&quot;) and also released two 2-disc compilation albums by them, &quot;1968–1980&quot; and &quot;Best Ballads&quot;. A new song, &quot;Kletva&quot;, was included on both compilations. The song is a re-recording of a track written for and previously featured in the film &quot;Vchera&quot; (1988) in 1987 and later appeared on the Kiril Marichkov solo album &quot;Zodia Shturets&quot;, from whose sessions the recording is taken. As well as &quot;Kletva&quot;, the song &quot;Za spomen ot Shturtsite&quot;, recorded in 1983, was included. It is a medley of the following songs:

*&quot;Dve sledi&quot; (Two Traces)
*&quot;Veselina&quot;
*&quot;Zvăn&quot; (Ring)
*&quot;Pesen bez dumi&quot; (A Song Without Words)
*&quot;Svatben den&quot; (Wedding Day)
*&quot;Dai mi malko nezhnost&quot; (Gimme a Little Tenderness)
*&quot;Zorata&quot; (The Dawn)
*&quot;Star album&quot; (Old Album)
*&quot;Pesen za Shturtsite&quot; (Song for Shturtsite/Song for the Crickets)
*&quot;Vkusăt na vremeto&quot; (The Taste of Time)

Another Shturtsite medley was performed at the concerts that became &quot;20 godini po-kusno&quot; in 1987, called &quot;Kitka &#x27;Shturtsite&#x27;&quot;.

In 1997, Shturtsite reformed and played a national tour. 10 tracks from one of the concerts were released on the CD &quot;30 godini Shturtsite&quot; in 1998, alongside six new songs.

The band released a 4-CD retrospective of their work, &quot;Antologia&quot;, in 2004. The release contained selected tracks from their discography and a few compilation and unreleased tracks. Their first 3 singles, &quot;Zvăn&quot;, &quot;Pesen za Shturtsite&quot; and &quot;Ti ne razbra&quot;, as well as &quot;Konnikăt&quot; and &quot;Musketarski marsh&quot;, were included in full on the discs. A concert DVD was also issued two years later, recorded at the NDK on 15 November 2004, featuring guest appearances from Safo, D-2, Doni (from Doni i Momchil) and Ahat, who also did a cover of &quot;Na praga&quot;.

In 2007, Shturtsite recorded new material, which was released as their 9th and final album &quot;Na praga na sărtseto&quot; in 2008. &quot;Na praga na sărtseto&quot; was their first release of all-new material since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Musketarski marsh&quot;.

The band still played concerts, but no new material was issued after &quot;Na praga na sărtseto&quot;. Marichkov had stated in interviews that guitarist Petar Gyuzelev&#x27;s brain tumour was holding the band back. He had stated that if Gyuzelev dies, Shturtsite would break up. In 2011, he had stated that Shturtsite would hold a big concert with a symphony orchestra to end the band and celebrate 45 years of existence, plus record an acoustic CD containing their hits. Neither the concert or the album happened.

Gyuzelev died on 25 April 2013, ending the band. Three months before his death, he issued &quot;Izpoved&quot;, his first and only solo album. In an interview with &quot;24 chasa&quot;, he stated he had plans to release three more albums &quot;before the end of the year&quot;. With Gyuzelev&#x27;s death, it is not known whether these albums will be released. Marichkov has since started a new band, Fondatsiata (The Foundation).

On 3 June 2017, Shturtsite reformed, with Marichkov&#x27;s &quot;Fondatsiata&quot; bandmates Ivan Lechev (from FSB) and Slavcho Nikolov (from B.T.R.) replacing Gyuzelev on guitar, for a 50th anniversary concert at the Armeec Arena in Sofia.

<text>Emil Dimitrov Dimitrov (; 23 December 1940 – 30 March 2005) was a Bulgarian singer, musician and composer. He is considered to be a legend of Bulgarian pop music, and one of the greatest Bulgarian singers of all time. He was popular for his songs &quot;&quot;Ако си дал&quot; (&#x27;If You Have Given&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Моя страна, моя България&quot; (&#x27;My Country, My Bulgaria&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Нашият сигнал&quot; (&#x27;Our Signal&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Само един живот&quot; (&#x27;Only One Lifetime&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Джулия&quot; (&#x27;Julia&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Арлекино&quot; (&#x27;Arlequine&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;&quot;Писмо до мама&quot; (&#x27;Letter to My Mother&#x27;)&quot; and others. Dimitrov was an extremely prolific artist, with 400 songs in his repertoire, and 280 of them being of his own composition; he released 30 albums in his lifetime.

He was born the son of the Bulgarian illusionist and his French assistant. He went to study at the National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts in Sofia.

His career began in 1962, with the premier of his song &quot;Arlekino&quot;; it won third place at the Sopot International Song Festival that year, and turned him into a star overnight.

In 1970 he was signed to the French record company EMI Pathé-Marconi, which released his first French-language single &quot;L&#x27;amour c&#x27;est toi&quot;. His song &quot;Monica&quot; (known in Bulgarian as &quot;&quot;Моя страна, моя България&quot; (&#x27;My country, my Bulgaria&#x27;)&quot; sold out with a circulation of over 500,000 copies in Germany and 100,000 copies in Belgium, although, it was initially banned by Bulgarian censors for &quot;bourgeois influence&quot;. In the modern day, it is considered to be an unofficial national hymn in Bulgaria.

He was married twice, and his son Emil was born from his second marriage in 1970.

According to the American magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; Emil Dimitrov sold over 40 million copies of his albums in Eastern Europe and the USSR.

<doc id="845462" wikidata="Q435236" url="?curid=845462" title="Martha Raye">
<text>Martha Raye (born Margy Reed; August 27, 1916 – October 19, 1994), nicknamed The Big Mouth, was an American comic actress and singer who performed in movies, and later on television. She also acted in plays, including on Broadway.
She was honored in 1969 at the Academy Awards as the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient for her volunteer efforts and services to the troops.

==Early years==
Raye was born at St. James Hospital in Butte, Montana, as Margy Reed, the daughter of Irish immigrant Peter F. Reed Jr., and Maybelle Hazel (Hooper) Reed, who had been raised in Milwaukee and Montana. Her parents were performing in a local vaudeville theatre as Reed and Hooper when their daughter was born.

==Career==
As a teenager in the early 1930s, Raye began her career as a vocalist with the Paul Ash and Boris Morros orchestras. She made her first film appearance in a band short titled &quot;A Nite in the Nite Club&quot; (1934). In 1936, she was signed for comic roles by Paramount Pictures; her first feature film was &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; with Bing Crosby. She made her Broadway debut in the Harry Akst musical &quot;Calling All Stars&quot; in 1934, and later returned to Broadway in starring roles in Yip Harburg&#x27;s &quot;Hold On to Your Hats&quot; (1941), Jerry Herman&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1967), and Vincent Youmans&#x27;s &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; (1972).

From 1936 to 1939, she was a featured cast member in 39 episodes of Al Jolson&#x27;s weekly CBS radio show, &quot;The Lifebuoy Program&quot;, also called &quot;Cafe Trocadero.&quot; In addition to comedy, Raye sang both solos and duets with Jolson. Over the next quarter century, she would appear in films with many of the leading comics of her day, including Joe E. Brown, Bob Hope, W.C. Fields, Abbott and Costello, Charlie Chaplin and Jimmy Durante. She joined the USO in 1942, soon after the US entered World War II.

She was known for the size of her mouth, which was large in proportion to her face, earning her the nickname &quot;The Big Mouth&quot;. She later referred to this in a series of television commercials for Polident denture cleaner in the 1980s: &quot;So take it from The Big Mouth: new Polident Green gets tough stains clean!&quot; Her large mouth would relegate her motion picture work to supporting comic parts, and was often made up so it appeared even larger. In the Disney cartoon &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot;, she is caricatured while dancing with Joe E. Brown, another actor known for a big mouth. In the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; (1937), she was caricatured as a jazzy scat-singing donkey named &#x27;Moutha Bray&#x27;.

In 1969, she was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in the form of an Oscar at the 41st Academy Awards. She was the first woman to receive this award. After her death, the statuette was displayed for many years in a specially constructed lighted niche at the Friars Club in Beverly Hills. On November 2, 1993, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for her service to her country. The citation reads:

===Television career===
She was a television star very early in its history. She starred in the short-lived (28 episodes) &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot; (1954–1956), opposite retired middleweight boxer Rocky Graziano, who played her boyfriend. The writer and producer was future &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; creator Nat Hiken.

Some of the guest stars on the show were Zsa Zsa Gabor, Cesar Romero, and Broadway dancer Wayne Lamb. She also appeared on other TV shows in the 1950s, such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

Following the demise of her TV variety show, the breakup of her fifth marriage, and a series of other personal and health problems, she attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills on August 14, 1956. Well-wishers gave her a St. Christopher&#x27;s medal, a St. Genesius medal, and a Star of David. After her recovery, she wore these amulets faithfully, but she was neither Catholic nor Jewish. At the conclusion of each episode of her TV shows, she would thank the nuns at the Sisters of St. Francis Hospital in Miami, Florida, where she had recovered. She always said &quot;Goodnight, Sisters&quot; as a sign of appreciation and gratitude.

Later in her career, she made television commercials for Polident denture cleanser, principally during the 1970s and 1980s.

===Later career===
In 1970, she portrayed Boss Witch, the &quot;Queen of all Witchdom&quot;, in the feature film &quot;Pufnstuf&quot; for Sid and Marty Krofft. This role led to her being cast as villainess Benita Bizarre in &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; (1970), which the Kroffts produced the same year.

She often appeared as a guest on other programs, particularly those which often featured older performers as guest stars, such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and on variety programs, including the short-lived &quot;The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show&quot;. She appeared from the third to the ninth seasons as Carrie Sharples, Mel&#x27;s mother on &quot;Alice&quot;, making two or three appearances per season. She made guest appearances or did cameos in series such as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, and &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;. She appeared again as Agatha for the six-episode run of the retooled &quot;McMillan&quot;, taking over for Nancy Walker, who had left the series. Her last film appearance was as an airline passenger in the disaster film &quot;The Concorde... Airport &#x27;79&quot; (1979).

==Personal life==
Raye&#x27;s personal life was complex and emotionally tumultuous. She was married seven times.

Raye was a devout Methodist. She regularly attended church, she read the Bible on a daily basis, and she also taught Sunday school. Because her religious views were frequently misconstrued, she said &quot;One paper says I&#x27;m Catholic, and the other says I&#x27;m Jewish. I guess that&#x27;s fitting because, as a Methodist, I&#x27;m meant to be undetermined some of the time&quot;.

Her engagement to orchestra leader Johnny Torrence was announced in June 1936. Less than two months later she commented, &quot;They tell me I&#x27;ve gone Hollywood already because I got engaged to Johnny Torrence one day and broke it off the next.&quot;

She was married to make-up artist Hamilton &quot;Buddy&quot; Westmore from May 30, 1937, until September 1937, filing for divorce on the basis of extreme cruelty; to composer-conductor David Rose from October 8, 1938, to May 19, 1941; to Neal Lang from May 25, 1941, to February 3, 1944; to Nick Condos from February 22, 1944, to June 17, 1953; to Edward T. Begley from April 21, 1954, to October 6, 1956; to Robert O&#x27;Shea from November 7, 1956, to December 1, 1960; and to Mark Harris from September 25, 1991, until her death in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/rayes-december&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She had one child, a daughter born in July 1944, with Nick Condos. Melodye Condos was named after Raye&#x27;s recently deceased younger sister.

Politically, Raye was conservative, in a 1984 interview, she affirmed: &quot;I believe in the constitution, strength in national defense, limited government, individual freedom, and personal responsibility. They reinforce the resolve that the United States is the greatest country in the world, and we can all be eternally grateful to our founding fathers for the beautiful legacy they left us.&quot;

===Death===
Raye died of pneumonia at the age of 78 on October 19, 1994.

==Legacy==
Appreciation of her work with the USO during World War II and subsequent wars led to her being named both an honorary colonel in the U.S. Marines and an honorary lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, and earned special consideration to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Upon her death it was instead requested that she be buried with full military honors in the Fort Bragg Main Post cemetery at Spring Lake, North Carolina, home of her loving and beloved United States Army Special Forces; the Fifth Special Forces Group (Airborne) made her an honorary Green Beret for her USO work in Vietnam, including an unauthorized visit to the Leghorn, a top secret SOG listening post on a spire in Laos.

Raye has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame—one for motion pictures at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard and the other for television at 6547 Hollywood Blvd.

The moving image collection of Martha Raye is held at the Academy Film Archive. The collection consists of an audio tape and home movies.

<text>A whiffenpoof was a tool for training Boy Scouts in tracking skills. The whiffenpoof itself was a small log, about the size of a stick of firewood, with nails driven into it on all sides, so that it bristled with nails. This was dragged through the forest on a short leash, by the older Scouts who were training the younger. It might thus create a track that the tenderfoot must learn to trace out. Or it might, alternately, be dragged across a trail in order to confuse the trackers. The fewer nails that were driven into it, the more difficult and subtle was the effect.

Thus it is that the word whiffenpoof can also refer to an imaginary or indefinite animal; e.g. &quot;the great-horned whiffenpoof&quot;. It originates from actor Joseph Cawthorn&#x27;s ad-lib in a 1908 performance of the operetta &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. He was told to stall for time while something was corrected backstage. In the scene, his character described imaginary prey he had hunted, so he created the &quot;water-dwelling, food-gobbling&quot; whiffenpoof on the spot. Yale students in the audience appropriated it for the name of their singing society.

==Imaginary or indefinite animal==

Particularly among hunters, &quot;whiffenpoof&quot; can be a tongue-in-cheek name for imaginary animal like the jackalope, or a placeholder name for an animal (analogous to &quot;thingamajig&quot;):



&quot;Whiffenpoof&quot; has been used as a joking fictitious name for a member of the upper crust; a 1922 Philadelphia newspaper columnist writes of an opera performance attended by &quot;Mrs. T. Whiffenpoof Oscarbilt, Mr. and Mrs. Dudbadubb Dodo and [their] three dashing daughters who have just finished a term at Mrs. Pettiduck&#x27;s School for Incorrigibles at Woodfern-by-the-Sea.&quot;

<text>A crew cut is a type of haircut in which the upright hair on the top of the head is cut relatively short, graduated in length from the longest hair that forms a short pomp (pompadour) at the front hairline to the shortest at the back of the crown so that in side profile, the outline of the top hair approaches the horizontal. Relative to the front view, and to varying degrees, the outline of the top hair can be arched or flattened at the short pomp front and rounded or flattened over the rest of the top to complement the front hairline, head shape, face shape and facial features. The hair on the sides and back of the head is usually tapered short, semi-short, or medium.

A short crew cut is sometimes referred to as a butch, though with the exception of variant forms, a butch differs from a crew cut in that the top hair is cut a uniform short length. A long crew cut can be referred to in the US as an ivy league crew cut or &quot;ivy league&quot;. A crew cut where the hair on the top of the head is graduated in length from the front hairline to a chosen point on the mid to back part of the crown as a flat plane, of level, upward sloping or downward sloping inclination is known as a flat top crew cut or flattop. The crew cut, flat top crew cut, butch cut and Ivy League haircut can be referred to as types of buzz cuts. These haircuts have become popular military-inspired styles for men who want a short and low-maintenance look.

==History==

In English, the crew cut and flat top crew cut were formerly known as the pompadour or short pompadour, as well as the brush cut, and had been worn since at least the mid-18th century. The style went by other names in other languages; in French, coupe à la brosse &quot;cut like a brush&quot;; in German, Bürstenschnitt; in Russian, ёжик &quot;hedgehog.&quot; A short pompadour with a flat top was considered the standard while a somewhat curved appearance across the top was suggested for wider foreheads and face shapes. The style with a flat top acquired the name brush top short pompadour and the style with a more rounded top, round top short pompadour. Prior to the invention of electric clippers with a motor in the handle in 1921 and their ensuing marketing and widespread use, barbers considered the perfect short pompadour to be the most time-consuming style to trim.The term &quot;crew haircut&quot; was most likely coined to describe the hairstyles worn by members of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell and other university crew teams, which were short to keep the hair from being blown into the face of the rower as the boat races down the course opposite the direction the rower is seated with both hands on the oars, making it impossible to brush the hair out of the face. The name drew a contrast to football haircuts, which had been long since 1889 when Princeton football players began wearing long hair to protect against head injury, thereby starting a trend, not altogether welcome; mop haired football players were frequently caricatured in the popular press. In 1895, the championship Yale football team appeared with &quot;close-cropped heads&quot; and subsequently long hair went out of style for football. Almost concurrently, the first helmets began to appear.
Crew cuts were popular in the 1920s and 1930s among college students, particularly in the Ivy League. The style was often worn as a summer haircut for its cooling effect. Men inducted into the military in World War II received G.I. haircuts, crew cuts, and a significant proportion continued to wear a crew cut while serving and after, as civilians. As long hair became popular in the mid-1960s, the crew cut and its variants waned in popularity through the 1970s. The crew cut began to come back into style in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the flat-top crew cut being the most popular crew cut style during the 1980s.

==Styling==

Thicker hair that wants to readily stand upright is ideal for a crew cut; with an appropriate head shape, a crew cut may be possible with fairly thin hair. When designing a crew cut, a barber follows the general sequence of other medium to short haircuts; edging, siding and topping. When designing a new crew cut and the current style is not relatively short, the hair on top or all over the head may initially be shortened with shears or clippers. Edging and siding together form a taper which usually is short, semi-short or medium. For a crew cut, some barbers perform edging and siding as one integrated process, regardless, the upper sides are initially boxed in and then cut to final form when designing the top. The hair on the top of the head can be styled clipper or shears over comb or free hand with a clipper.With the clipper or shears over comb method, the comb is inserted in the upright hair at the desired length and the hair is reduced to this length by means of clippers or shears severing the hair above the teeth of the comb. Freehand means the clipper blade or guard does not determine the cut hair length but rather the distance the cutting blade is held above the scalp sets the cut length.

The barber selects the most complementary final form for the top according to face shape, skull shape, frontal hairline, and facial features within parameters set by customer instructions. Specifically, the short pompadour front can be made higher or lower, wider or narrower and can be flattened or arched to varying degrees across the forehead; the hair over the rest of the top can be more rounded or flattened; the upper sides can have more or less volume. In side profile, the outward appearance of the upright top hair should approach the horizontal; if the hair is cut so the upright top hair appears horizontal when the head is viewed from the front as well as the side, as a flat plane, the style is generally referred to as a flat-top crew cut or flat top; per customer wishes and the shape of the skull and frontal hairline, the flat plane can be level, upward or downward sloping relative to the forehead. A crew cut with a longer top can be referred to in the US as an ivy league crew cut or &quot;ivy league&quot;. A long crew cut might be graduated in length on the top of the head from at the front hairline to at the back of the crown. A crew cut with a shorter top might have a similar proportional graduated difference in the length of the hair on the top of the head. If a short crew cut is at the front hairline, the length of the hair at the back of the crown might be .

<doc id="845483" wikidata="Q7898391" url="?curid=845483" title="Upminster Windmill">
<text>Upminster Windmill is a Grade II* listed smock mill located in Upminster in the London Borough of Havering, England. It was formerly known as Abraham&#x27;s Mill and was in Essex when built. Between 2016 and 2023 the mill was restored to working order and a visitor centre was constructed. The mill and visitor centre are open to the public at selected times.

==History==
Although there had been a windmill in Upminster since at least 1768, this mill was built for James Nokes of Hunt&#x27;s Farm in Corbets Tey Road in 1803 on land transferred from Bridge House Farm which was owned by his brother William. It had four Common sails and drove three pairs of millstones. A steam engine was added early in 1811 driving two pairs of millstones, an action which increased the rateable value of the mill from £30 to £77. A fourth pair of millstones was added to the mill. James Nokes died in 1838 and the mill passed to his son Thomas. A fifth pair of millstones had been added by 1849 when Thomas Nokes was bankrupt. By 1856 the mill was driving six pairs of millstones by wind and steam. Thomas Abraham purchased the mill in 1857, having previously been in the employ of Nokes at both West Thurrock windmill and Upminster. He had also been in business at a steam mill in Navestock for the previous two years. In 1876, the upright shaft was broken in an accident at the mill. It was repaired with a cast-iron coupling.

Thomas Abraham died in 1882 and the mill passed to John Arkell Abraham. In 1889 the mill was struck by lightning and on 5 January 1900 the windshaft snapped at the neck and the sails crashed to the ground. A windshaft from a post mill near Maldon was fitted along with four new sails. After the death of John Arkell Abraham, the mill passed to his nephews Thomas, Alfred and Clement. In 1927 a stock was replaced and the fantail repaired. The mill last worked commercially in 1934 and was purchased for £3,400 by W H Simmonds. The steam-driven machinery was sold and the associated outbuildings decayed and were eventually demolished. The mill was subsequently purchased by Essex County Council in the late 1930s, and was listed in 1955

On 22 June 2004, the Upminster Windmill Preservation Trust were granted a 35-year lease on the mill. On 18 January 2007, the windmill suffered damage in extremely high winds. The stock sustained damage as did the sail, but there was little other damage to the mill. Two new sails were fitted by Vincent Pargeter in August 2008.

==Description==
The mill has a four-storey smock on a single-storey brick base. There is a stage at first-floor level. It has a boat-shaped cap with a gallery, winded by a six-bladed fantail. Four Patent sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill drives four pairs of millstones by wind. The mill is in height to the top of the cap.

===Base===
The brick base is across the flats and high. The brickwork is thick at ground level, diminishing to at the top.

===Smock===
The four-storey smock has cant posts of by section, long. the sills are by in section, long. The spout floor is across the flats, the stone floor is across the flats and the top of the smock tower is diameter at the curb. The main floor beams are square at all levels except the dust floor. The main transoms are by in section at all levels.

===Cap and fantail===

The boat-shaped cap is by in plan and high. The main sheer beams are square, on centres, with the weatherbeam of by section at the centre and square at the ends. The cap is thought to be the work of the millwright William Bear of Ballingdon and is unusual in having an external gallery. The fantail consists of six wooden vanes set at right-angles to the sails, and has the year 1799 carved on the horizontal wooden beam beneath it.

===Sails and windshaft===

The octagonal cast-iron windshaft has two square sections to take a head wheel and tail wheel as was its intended purpose in a post mill, and was moved to Upminster from a post mill near Maldon in 1899 to replace one broken during a storm. It carries a composite brake wheel with eight cast-iron arms and six wooden cants. The brake wheel has 78 cogs. The neck bearing of the windshaft is a roller bearing, fitted after the mill ceased working commercially.

Originally Upminster windmill had canvas sails, but the sails on the mill when it ceased working commercially were four double patent sails. They were carried on two stocks long, square at the centre, tapering to by at the ends. The sails were in span, and tapered from wide at the heel to at the tip. Each sail had twelve bays with three shutters per bay, giving a total of 288 shutters, each carved with a number in Roman numerals to indicate its location. The weather on the sails was 23° at the heel and almost 0° at the tip.

===Machinery===
The upright shaft is wooden, in two sections for reasons noted above. It is twelve sided, across the flats and long in total. The wallower is of compass arm construction, in diameter with 43 cogs. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the compass arm great spur wheel has 126 cogs. It drives four pairs of underdrift millstones via stone nuts with 24 cogs.

The millstones are three pairs of French Burr stones and one pair of Peak stones. Two pairs of the French Burr stones are in diameter, and the other two pairs of millstones are in diameter.

===Steam engine===
The steam engine was located in a brick building built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a sack hoist. The steam-driven millstones were located on two levels and driven by a shaft of length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron bevel wheel with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various dressing machines in the windmill, but not the wind-driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman &amp; Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960, with two of the millstones remaining at the windmill entrance.

<text>De Bellis Antiquitatis or DBA (English: Of the Wars of Antiquity) is a fast play set of rules for the hobby of historical miniature wargaming, particularly ancient and medieval wargaming in the period 3000 BC to 1520 AD. These rules allow entire armies to be represented by fewer than 50 figures. The rules also include diagrams and over 600 army lists. DBA is produced by the Wargames Research Group and was the first game in the DBx series, which now includes De Bellis Multitudinis (DBM), De Bellis Magistrorum Militum (DBMM, a successor or alternative to DBM), Hordes of the Things (a fantasy version), De Bellis Renationis (DBR, a Renaissance version), and Horse Foot and Guns (HFG covering 1700-1920). An online video game titled &quot;DBA Online&quot; was also created.

==Scale and basing==
Scale: Each army is composed of 12 elements (stands), with several figures fixed upon each one. The number of men represented by an element varies according to the size of the army simulated and the number of figures that it has, but at a nominal ground it would be more or less 250 for each figure. Ground scale is 1&quot; = 100 paces for 15 mm figures or smaller, 40 mm = 100 paces for 25/28 mm figures. One turn, called a bound in the rules, represents 15 minutes. Can be used with 25/28 mm, 15 mm, 6 mm, or 2 mm figures (54mm and larger a possible with increased base size).

Basing: The width of the base depends upon the scale of figures being used; the depth depends upon both figure scale and type. The number of figures per base also depends upon the figure&#x27;s type. For instance, an element of 15 mm swordsmen is composed of 4 figures mounted on a 40 mm (frontage) x 15 mm (depth) base; a 15 mm elephant is mounted alone on a 40 mm x 40 mm base.

== History of the rules ==
DBA traces its origin back to a two-page experimental set of rules by Phil Barker dubbed &quot;De Bellis Societatis Antiquorum&quot; that was demonstrated at the Society of Ancients (after whom these experimental rules were named) conferences for 1988 and 1989. Many rulesets at that time (including Phil Barker&#x27;s WRG series of ancients rules) had added greater and greater detail regarding weapons and armor, movement and orders. Many gamers perceived that this increased complexity came at a cost in playability.

The &quot;De Bellis Societatis Antiquorum&quot; ruleset was designed as a &quot;tonic for the jaded&quot; with the goal of providing a fun, fast and challenging game and as an alternative to the WRG series of ancients rules. The first commercial edition of DBA was published in 1990, with Phil and Sue Barker and Richard Bodley Scott as its authors. The game has continued to evolve over the years; the most recent version was published in November, 2014 with just Phil Barker and Sue Laflin Barker as authors.

* DBA 1.0, 1990
* DBA 1.1, March 1995
* DBA 1.2, 1998 (Issued as a set of amendments)
* DBA 1.22, 1999 (Issued as a set of amendments)
* DBA 2.0, February 2001
* DBA 2.1, 2003 (Issued as a set of amendments)
* DBA 2.2, January 2004
* There have been many variants of the game, one is DBA 2.2+, 2012 (Issued by WADBAG, unofficial)
* DBA 3.0, November 2014

==Online version==

An online version known as DBAOL (DBA On-Line) was published by Wargaming.net in 2000, based upon DBA v1.2 and upgraded to 1.22. However the online version of the game was not upgraded to match newer versions of DBA, and the website announced that it is closing down from 1 December 2019.

Versions of DBA are available on Vassal and Tabletop simulator.

Players use a single six-sided die each, and games are played on a square field, which conventionally (though not necessarily) has sides that are roughly sixteen times the base width being used.

Though the exact details differ in different editions of the game, in the current version players roll dice to determine who will be the invader and who will be the defender. The defender uses a random process to place terrain according to his army&#x27;s home territory, and the invader chooses which side his army will enter the board. The players then alternate in placing their camp model and armies, and the defender takes the first bound.

Players then alternate bounds. At the start of each bound, the active player dices for &quot;PIPs&quot;. PIPs are the spots on a die. The number of PIPs rolled represents the player&#x27;s level of control for the turn. Players spend their PIPs to move single elements or connected groups of elements on the game board. PIPs do not carry over from turn to turn. PIPs simulate (though not model) the difficulties of command and control during a battle, and players find that once battle is joined, they often need to spend all of their available PIPs shoring up their battle line, with few PIPs left over for maneuver of un-engaged elements.

After making any such desired moves, the players then conduct combat, both ranged and close combat, adjudicated in the order specified by the active player.

Combat is resolved per-element, in the order desired by the active player. To resolve combat, each player throws one die and adds modifiers for both troop type and battlefield situation (such as being outflanked or up hill). The higher roll wins the combat and results are applied immediately, before the next combat is decided. Achieving a roll twice as high as your opponent generally destroys that opponent, with lesser successes merely pushing the opponent back out of the line of battle. Note that since results are applied immediately, shrewd players resolve combats whose results can give them advantages against other elements in future combats.

Once all combats have been resolved, the other player takes their turn. The game continues in this way until one of the players achieves the win condition - the destruction of 1/3 of the enemy&#x27;s army. In the event of a tie at the end of bound, play continues until the end of a bound where one player has lost more than the opponent.

==Criticisms==

Some players have found Phil Barker&#x27;s succinct rule writing style to be difficult to decipher, referring to it as &quot;Barkerese&quot;. The current version involved many players giving the author advice to improve the format and readability.

Due to the nature of DBA&#x27;s combat system, DBA is often criticized as being over-&quot;geometric&quot;, as elements are matched up in precise ways, and base widths must match up with some precision. Many of the improvements in the various editions of DBA have been to address geometric concerns and &quot;millimetrics&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Over the years, several historical and fantasy wargame systems stemmed from the original DBA rules and its fantasy derivative, Hordes of the Things. These systems tend to retain similar basing standards compared with DBA, but strive for an overall clearer presentation of the rules (in clear contrast to the &quot;Barkerese&quot;). Furthermore, each system had existing rules and units changed to achieve different gameplay and simulation goals. These systems also offer a more streamlined player support, with rules errata, Facebook groups and forums. Most systems abandoned the traditional 12-elements army model, and created a point-based system to allow for more balanced confrontations between armies.

<text>Giovanni Battista Riccioli (17 April 1598 – 25 June 1671) was an Italian astronomer and a Catholic priest in the Jesuit order. He is known, among other things, for his experiments with pendulums and with falling bodies, for his discussion of 126 arguments concerning the motion of the Earth, and for introducing the current scheme of lunar nomenclature. He is also widely known for discovering the first double star. He argued that the rotation of the Earth should reveal itself because on a rotating Earth, the ground moves at different speeds at different times.

== Biography ==
Riccioli was born in Ferrara. He entered the Society of Jesus on 6 October 1614. After completing his novitiate, he began to study humanities in 1616, pursuing those studies first at Ferrara, and then at Piacenza.

From 1620 to 1628 he studied philosophy and theology at the College of Parma. Parma Jesuits had developed a strong program of experimentation, such as with falling bodies. One of the most famous Italian Jesuits of the time, Giuseppe Biancani (1565–1624), was teaching at Parma when Riccioli arrived there. Biancani accepted new astronomical ideas, such as the existence of lunar mountains and the fluid nature of the heavens, and collaborated with the Jesuit astronomer Christoph Scheiner (1573–1650) on sunspot observations. Riccioli mentions him with gratitude and admiration.

By 1628 Riccioli&#x27;s studies were complete and he was ordained. He requested missionary work, but that request was turned down. Instead, he was assigned to teach at Parma. There he taught logic, physics, and metaphysics from 1629 to 1632, and engaged in some experiments with falling bodies and pendulums. In 1632 he became a member of a group charged with the formation of younger Jesuits, among whom Daniello Bartoli. He spent the 1633–1634 academic year in Mantua, where he collaborated with Niccolò Cabeo (1576–1650) in further pendulum studies. In 1635 he was back at Parma, where he taught theology and also carried out his first important observation of the Moon. In 1636 he was sent to Bologna to serve as Professor of theology.

Riccioli described himself as a theologian, but one with a strong and ongoing interest in astronomy since his student days, when he studied under Biancani. He said that many Jesuits were theologians, but few were astronomers. He said that once the enthusiasm for astronomy arose within him he could never extinguish it, and so he became more committed to astronomy than theology. Eventually his superiors in the Jesuit order officially assigned him to the task of astronomical research. However, he also continued to write on theology (see below).

Riccioli built an astronomical observatory in Bologna at the College of St. Lucia, equipped with many instruments for astronomical observations, including telescopes, quadrants, sextants, and other traditional instruments. Riccioli dealt not only with astronomy in his research, but also with physics, arithmetic, geometry, optics, gnomonics, geography, and chronology. He collaborated with others in his work, including other Jesuits, most notably Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1618–1663) at Bologna, and he kept up a voluminous correspondence with others who shared his interests, including Hevelius, Huygens, Cassini, and Kircher.

He was awarded a prize by Louis XIV in recognition of his activities and their relevance to contemporary culture.

Riccioli continued to publish on both astronomy and theology up to his death. He died in Bologna at 73 years of age.

== Scientific work ==
===&quot;Almagestum Novum&quot;===

One of Riccioli&#x27;s most significant works was his 1651 &quot;Almagestum Novum&quot; (&quot;New Almagest&quot;), an encyclopedic work consisting of over 1500 folio pages (38 cm x 25 cm) densely packed with text, tables, and illustrations. It became a standard technical reference book for astronomers all over Europe: John Flamsteed (1646–1719), the first English astronomer royal, a Copernican and a Protestant, used it for his Gresham lectures; Jérôme Lalande (1732–1807) of the Paris Observatory cited it extensively even though it was an old book at that point; the 1912 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; calls it the most important literary work of the Jesuits during the seventeenth century. Within its two volumes were ten &quot;books&quot; covering every subject within astronomy and related to astronomy at the time:
#the celestial sphere and subjects such as celestial motions, the equator, ecliptic, zodiac, etc.
#the Earth and its size, gravity and pendulum motion, etc.
#the Sun, its size and distance, its motion, observations involving it, etc.
#the Moon, its phases, its size and distance, etc. (detailed maps of the Moon as seen through a telescope were included)
#lunar and solar eclipses
#the fixed stars
#the planets and their motions, etc. (representations of each as seen with a telescope were included);
#comets and novae (&quot;new stars&quot;)
#the structure of the universe—the heliocentric and geocentric theories, etc.
#calculations related to astronomy.

Riccioli envisioned that the &quot;New Almagest&quot; would have three volumes, but only the first (with its 1500 pages split into two parts) was completed.

====Pendulums and falling bodies====
Riccioli is credited with being the first person to precisely measure the acceleration due to gravity of falling bodies. Books 2 and 9 of the &quot;New Almagest&quot; Riccioli included a significant discussion of and extensive experimental reports on the motions of falling bodies and pendulums.

He was interested in the pendulum as a device for precisely measuring time. By counting the number of pendulum swings that elapsed between transits of certain stars, Riccioli was able to experimentally verify that the period of a pendulum swinging with small amplitude is constant to within two swings out of 3212 (0.062%). He also reported that a pendulum&#x27;s period increases if the amplitude of its swing is increased to 40 degrees. He sought to develop a pendulum whose period was precisely one second – such a pendulum would complete 86,400 swings in a 24-hour period. This he directly tested, twice, by using stars to mark time and recruiting a team of nine fellow Jesuits to count swings and maintain the amplitude of swing for 24 hours. The results were pendulums with periods within 1.85%, and then 0.69%, of the desired value; and Riccioli even sought to improve on the latter value. The seconds pendulum was then used as a standard for calibrating pendulums with different periods. Riccioli said that for measuring time a pendulum was not a perfectly reliable tool, but in comparison with other methods it was an exceedingly reliable tool.

With pendulums to keep time (sometimes augmented by a chorus of Jesuits chanting in time with a pendulum to provide an audible timer) and a tall structure in the form of Bologna&#x27;s Torre de Asinelli from which to drop objects, Riccioli was able to engage in precise experiments with falling bodies. He verified that falling bodies followed Galileo&#x27;s &quot;odd-number&quot; rule so that the distance travelled by a falling body increases in proportion to the square of the time of fall, indicative of constant acceleration. According to Riccioli, a falling body released from rest travels 15 Roman feet (4.44 m) in one second, 60 feet (17.76 m) in two seconds, 135 feet (39.96 m) in three seconds, etc. Other Jesuits such as the above-mentioned Cabeo had argued that this rule had not been rigorously demonstrated. His results showed that, while falling bodies generally showed constant acceleration, there were differences determined by weight and size and density. Riccioli said that if two heavy objects of differing weight are dropped simultaneously from the same height, the heavier one descends more quickly so long as it is of equal or greater density; if both objects are of equal weight the denser one descends more quickly.

For example, in dropping balls of wood and lead that both weighed 2.5 ounces, Riccioli found that upon the leaden ball having traversed 280 Roman feet the wooden ball had traversed only 240 feet (a table in the &quot;New Almagest&quot; contains data on twenty one such paired drops). He attributed such differences to the air, and noted that air density had to be considered when dealing with falling bodies. He illustrated the reliability of his experiments by providing detailed descriptions of how they were carried out, so that anyone could reproduce them, complete with diagrams of the Torre de Asinelli that showed heights, drop locations, etc.

Riccioli noted that while these differences did contradict Galileo&#x27;s claim that balls of differing weight would fall at the same rate, it was possible Galileo observed the fall of bodies made of the same material but of differing sizes, for in that case the difference in fall time between the two balls is much smaller than if the balls are of same size but differing materials, or of the same weight but differing sizes, etc., and that difference is not apparent unless the balls are released from a very great height. At the time, various people had expressed concern with Galileo&#x27;s ideas about falling bodies, arguing that it would be impossible to discern the small differences in time and distance needed to adequately test Galileo&#x27;s ideas, or reporting that experiments had not agreed with Galileo&#x27;s predictions, or complaining that suitably tall buildings with clear paths of fall were not available to thoroughly test Galileo&#x27;s ideas. By contrast, Riccioli was able to show that he had carried out repeated, consistent, precise experiments in an ideal location. Thus as D. B. Meli notes,

Riccioli&#x27;s accurate experiments were widely known during the second half of the [seventeenth] century and helped forge a consensus on the empirical adequacy of some aspects of Galileo&#x27;s work, especially the odd-number rule and the notion that heavy bodies fall with similar accelerations and speed is not proportional to weight. His limited agreement with Galileo was significant, coming as it did from an unsympathetic reader who had gone so far as to include the text of Galileo&#x27;s condemnation in his own publications.
====Work concerning the Moon====
Riccioli and Grimaldi extensively studied the Moon, of which Grimaldi drew maps. This material was included in Book 4 of the &quot;New Almagest&quot;. Grimaldi&#x27;s maps were based on earlier work by Johannes Hevelius and Michael van Langren. On one of these maps, Riccioli provided names for lunar features—names that are the basis for the nomenclature of lunar features still in use today. For example, Mare Tranquillitatis (The Sea of Tranquility, site of the Apollo 11 landing in 1969), received its name from Riccioli. Riccioli named large lunar areas for weather. He named craters for significant astronomers, grouping them by philosophies and time periods. Although Riccioli rejected the Copernican theory, he named a prominent lunar crater &quot;Copernicus&quot;, and he named other important craters after other proponents of the Copernican theory such as Kepler, Galileo and Lansbergius. Because craters that he and Grimaldi named after themselves are in the same general vicinity as these, while craters named for some other Jesuit astronomers are in a different part of the Moon, near the very prominent crater named for Tycho Brahe, Riccioli&#x27;s lunar nomenclature has at times been considered to be a tacit expression of sympathy for a Copernican theory that, as a Jesuit, he could not publicly support. However, Riccioli said he put the Copernicans all in stormy waters (the Oceanus Procellarum). Another noteworthy feature of the map is that Riccioli included on it a direct statement that the Moon is not inhabited. This ran counter to speculations about an inhabited Moon that had been present in the works of Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, and even Kepler, and which would continue on in works of later writers such as Bernard de Fontenelle and William Herschel.

====Arguments concerning the motion of the Earth====
A substantial portion of the &quot;New Almagest&quot; (Book 9, consisting of 343 pages) is devoted to an analysis of the world system question: Is the universe geocentric or heliocentric? Does the Earth move or is it immobile? The historian of science Edward Grant has described Book 9 as being the &quot;probably the lengthiest, most penetrating, and authoritative&quot; analysis of this question made by &quot;any author of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries&quot;, in his opinion apparently superseding even Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems — Ptolemaic and Copernican.&quot; Indeed, one writer has recently described Book 9 as &quot;the book Galileo was supposed to write&quot;. Within Book 9 Riccioli discusses 126 arguments concerning Earth&#x27;s motion — 49 for and 77 against. To Riccioli the question was not between the geocentric world system of Ptolemy and the heliocentric world system of Copernicus, for the telescope had unseated the Ptolemaic system; it was between the geo-heliocentric world system developed by Tycho Brahe in the 1570s (in which the Sun, Moon, and stars circle an immobile Earth, while the planets circle the Sun – sometimes called a &quot;geo-heliocentric&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot; system) and that of Copernicus. As the frontispiece of the &quot;New Almagest&quot; illustrates (see figure at right), Riccioli favoured a modified version of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s system; here is how he described the system that &quot;came to [his] mind&quot; when he was in Parma : &quot;it shares everything with the Tychonian system, except the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter; for [me] their center was not the Sun, but Earth itself&quot;.

Many writers make references to Riccioli&#x27;s analysis and the 126 arguments. However, translations of arguments of the &quot;New Almagest&quot;, and discussions of the arguments to any extent by more modern writers are rare: only for three arguments of the 126 are such translations and discussions readily available. These are, first, an argument Riccioli called the &quot;physico-mathematical argument&quot;, which was related to one of Galileo&#x27;s conjectures; second, an argument based on what today is known as the &quot;Coriolis effect&quot;; third, an argument based on the appearance of stars as seen through the telescopes of the time.

=====The &quot;physico-mathematical&quot; argument=====
Riccioli discusses the physico-mathematical argument in regard to arguments both for and against Earth&#x27;s motion. Galileo offered a conjecture in his 1632 &quot;Dialogue&quot; that the apparent linear acceleration of a stone falling from a tower was the result of two uniform circular motions acting in combination – the daily rotation of Earth, and a second uniform circular motion belonging to the stone and acquired from being carried along by the tower. Galileo says that [T]he true and real motion of the stone is never accelerated at all, but is always equable and uniform... So we need not look for any other causes of acceleration or any other motions, for the moving body, whether remaining on the tower or falling, moves always in the same manner; that is, circularly, with the same rapidity, and with the same uniformity... if the line described by a falling body is not exactly this, it is very near to it... [and] according to these considerations, straight motion goes entirely out the window and nature never makes any use of it at all. Riccioli explained that this conjecture could not work: It could not apply to the fall of bodies near the Earth&#x27;s poles, where there would be little or no circular motion caused by Earth&#x27;s rotation; and even at the equator where there would be more motion caused by Earth&#x27;s rotation, the rate of fall predicted by Galileo&#x27;s idea was too slow. Riccioli argued that the problems with Galileo&#x27;s conjecture were a mark against the Copernican world system, but modern writers differ in regards to Riccioli&#x27;s reasoning on this.

=====The &quot;coriolis effect&quot; argument=====

Riccioli also argued that the rotation of the Earth should reveal itself in the flight of artillery projectiles, because on a rotating Earth the ground moves at different speeds at different latitudes. He wrote that If a ball is fired along a Meridian toward the pole (rather than toward the East or West), diurnal motion will cause the ball to be carried off [that is, the trajectory of the ball will be deflected], all things being equal: for on parallels of latitude nearer the poles, the ground moves more slowly, whereas on parallels nearer the equator, the ground moves more rapidly. Therefore, were a cannon, aimed directly at a target to the north, to fire a ball, that ball would strike slightly to the east (right) of the target, thanks to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. But, if the cannon were fired to the east there would be no deflection, as both cannon and target would move the same distance in the same direction. Riccioli said that the best of cannoneers could fire a ball right into the mouth of an enemy&#x27;s cannon; if this deflection effect existed in northward shots they would have detected it. Riccioli argued that the absence of this effect indicated that the Earth does not rotate. He was correct in his reasoning in that the effect he describes actually does occur. It is known today as the Coriolis effect after the nineteenth-century physicist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis (1792–1843). However, the rightward deflection actually occurs regardless of the direction the cannon is pointed (a much more developed understanding of physics than what was available in Riccioli&#x27;s time is required to explain this). At any rate, the effect would have been too small for cannoneers of the time to detect.

=====The star size argument=====
Riccioli also used telescopic observations of stars to argue against the Copernican theory. Viewed through the small telescopes of his time, stars appeared as small but distinct disks. These disks were spurious – caused by the diffraction of waves of light entering the telescope. Today they are known as Airy disks, after the nineteenth-century astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801–1892). The real disks of stars are generally too tiny to be seen even with the best of modern telescopes. But during most of the seventeenth century it was thought that these disks seen in a telescope were the actual bodies of stars. In the Copernican theory, the stars had to lie at vast distances from Earth in order to explain why no annual parallax was seen among them. Riccioli and Grimaldi made numerous measurements of star disks using a telescope, providing a detailed description of their procedure so that anyone who wanted could replicate it. Riccioli then calculated the physical sizes that the measured stars would need to have in order for them both to be as far away as was required in the Copernican theory to show no parallax, and to have the sizes seen with the telescope. The result in all cases was that the stars were huge – dwarfing the sun. In some scenarios one single star would exceed the size of the entire universe as estimated by a geocentrist like Tycho Brahe. This problem that the appearance of stars in the telescope posed for the Copernican theory had been noted as early as 1614 by Simon Marius, who said telescopic observations of the disks of stars supported the Tychonic theory. The problem was acknowledged by Copernicans such as Martin van den Hove (1605–1639), who also measured the disks of stars and acknowledged that the issue of vast star sizes might lead people to reject the Copernican theory.

=====Other arguments=====
The other arguments Riccioli presents in Book 9 of the &quot;New Almagest&quot; were diverse. There were arguments concerning: whether buildings could stand or birds could fly if Earth rotated; what sorts of motions were natural to heavy objects; what constitutes the more simple and elegant celestial arrangement; whether the heavens or the Earth was the more suited for motion and the more easily and economically moved; whether the center of the universe was a more or less noble position; and many others. Many of the anti-Copernican arguments in the &quot;New Almagest&quot; had roots in the anti-Copernican arguments of Tycho Brahe. 
Riccioli argued vigorously against the Copernican system, and even characterized certain arguments for terrestrial immobility as unanswerable. However, he also rebutted certain anti-Copernican arguments, siding with the Copernicans in his assertions that rotation of the Earth would not necessarily be felt, and that it would not ruin buildings or leave birds behind. Some authors have suggested that Riccioli may have been a secret Copernican, required due to his position as a Jesuit to pretend to oppose the theory.

===The &quot;Astronomia Reformata&quot; (&quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot;)===
Another prominent astronomical publication of Riccioli&#x27;s was his 1665 &quot;Astronomia Reformata&quot; (&quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot;)—another large volume, although only half the length of the &quot;New Almagest&quot;. The contents of the two significantly overlap; the &quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot; might be thought of as a condensed and updated version of the &quot;New Almagest&quot;.
The &quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot; contains an extensive report on the changing appearance of Saturn. Included in the section on Jupiter is an apparent record of a very early (if not the earliest) observation of Jupiter&#x27;s Great Red Spot, made by Leander Bandtius, Abbot of Dunisburgh and owner of a particularly fine telescope, in late 1632. Also in that section Riccioli includes reports of Jovian cloud belts appearing and disappearing over time.

The appearance of the physico-mathematical argument in the &quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot; was the occasion for Stefano degli Angeli (1623–1697) to launch an &quot;unexpected, somewhat disrespectful and sometimes flippant attack&quot; on Riccioli and the argument. James Gregory published a report in England in 1668 on the resulting public and personal dispute on the matter of falling objects. This was a prelude to Robert Hooke&#x27;s (1635–1703) invitation to Isaac Newton (1642–1727) to resume his scientific correspondence with the Royal Society, and to their ensuing discussion about the trajectory of falling bodies &quot;that turned Newton&#x27;s mind away from &#x27;other business&#x27; and back to the study of terrestrial and celestial mechanics.&quot; The &quot;Reformed Astronomy&quot; featured an adaptation to the accumulating observational evidence in favor of Johannes Kepler&#x27;s elliptical celestial mechanics: it incorporated elliptical orbits into the geo-heliocentric Tychonic theory. Riccioli accepted Kepler&#x27;s ideas, but remained opposed to the heliocentric theory. Indeed, following the dispute with Angeli, Riccioli&#x27;s attitude toward heliocentrism hardened.

===Arc measurement===
Between 1644 and 1656, Riccioli and Grimaldi were occupied by topographical surveys, specifically an arc measurement for determining values for the circumference of Earth. Defects of method, however, gave a less accurate value for degrees of arc of the meridian than Snellius had achieved a few years earlier. Snellius&#x27; survey had been mistaken by approximately 4,000 meters; but Riccioli was more than 10,000 meters in error. Riccioli had come up with 373,000 &quot;pedes&quot; despite the fact that references to a Roman degree in antiquity had always been 75 milliaria or 375,000 pedes.

===Other work===
He is often credited with being one of the first to telescopically observe the star Mizar and note that it was a double star; however, Castelli and Galileo observed it much earlier.

In the words of Alfredo Dinis, Riccioli enjoyed great prestige and great opposition, both in Italy and abroad, not only as a man of encyclopedic knowledge but also as someone who could understand and discuss all the relevant issues in cosmology, observational astronomy, and geography of the time.

<text>The Bayandurids or the Tur-&#x27;Alids ruled over the Aq Qoyunlu confederation, that was founded by Tur Ali bin Pehlwan (1340-1360 C.E.), and was followed by his son Qutlugh bin Tur Ali (1360-1378/79 C.E.) and his grandson Uthman Beg respectively, the founder of Aq Qoyunlu state. The dynasty originated around Diyarbakır and ruled the territory now part of present-day Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Their capital was the city of Tabriz after 1471–1472. They gained international significance under Uzun Hasan who became their greatest leader. He conquered the Qara Qoyunlu and defeated the Timurid Empire, thus adding significant portions of Iran to his kingdom. He eventually lost to the Ottoman Empire, weakening his kingdom. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into Safavid Iran.
==Aq Qoyunlu rulers==
*In letters from the Ottoman Sultans, when addressing the kings of Aq Qoyunlu, such titles as &quot;Iranian King of Kings&quot;, &quot;Iranian Sultan of Sultans&quot;, &quot;Shåhanshåh Irån Khadiv Ajam&quot; &quot;Shahanshah of Iran and Ruler of Persia&quot;, &quot;Jamshid shawkat va Fereydun råyat va Dårå deråyat&quot; &quot;Powerful like Jamshid, flag of Fereydun and wise like Darius&quot; have been used. Uzun Hassan also held the title &quot;Padishah-i Iran&quot; &quot;Padishah of Iran&quot;, which was re-adopted again in the Safavid times through his grandson Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty.

<doc id="845519" wikidata="Q1251975" url="?curid=845519" title="Mickey Welch">
<text>Michael Francis Welch (July 4, 1859 – July 30, 1941), nicknamed &quot;Smiling Mickey&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball pitcher. He stood tall and weighed . He was the third pitcher to accumulate 300 career victories. Welch was born in Brooklyn, New York, and played 13 seasons in the major leagues, three with the Troy Trojans, and 10 with the New York Gothams/Giants. He was very successful with an effective curveball, a change of pace, and a version of the screwball. During his 13 major league seasons, he posted 20 or more wins nine times, seven in succession.

==Early life==
Welch was born Michael Francis Walsh in the 18th Ward of Brooklyn, New York, to Irish immigrant parents John and Mary Walsh. He later adopted the last name Welch, perhaps spurred by a sportswriter&#x27;s mistaken recording of his name in a box score, and to distinguish himself from the many men in Brooklyn at the time named Michael Walsh. Off the baseball field, Welch used his birth name throughout his life. Welch&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Smiling Mickey&quot; derived from his cheerful disposition.

When he was growing up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, baseball was the popular sport among Irish children. Welch recalled that he had to learn different baseball skills because of his small size. He depended on strong control of his pitches, a good curveball and change-of-pace, and a studious approach to opposing batters.

==Major league career==

===Early career===
Welch&#x27;s earliest professional baseball engagement was in Poughkeepsie, New York, as an outfielder-pitcher for the Volunteers baseball club in 1877, and in the following year he would briefly play for a club in Auburn before joining the Holyoke Shamrocks of the National Association. During the 1879 season with the Shamrocks, his pitching would be credited to their 23–14 record, during which he was supported by the likes of later MLB players Roger Connor, Larry Corcoran, Jerry Dorgan, Peter Gillespie, and Fergy Malone. In 1880, Welch made his major league debut in 1880. His first game was not very successful, as Troy was defeated 13–1 by the Worcester Ruby Legs. However, he won 34 games for the Troy Trojans, teaming up with Tim Keefe to give Troy a devastating two-man starting rotation. On July 6, 1880, he pitched a one-hitter against the Cleveland Blues. Welch&#x27;s totals dipped during the following two seasons, when Keefe, who also went on to win more than 300 games, began getting a greater share of the starts. The duo would only enjoy moderate success over the course of three seasons with the Trojans, a team that never finished higher than fourth in the National League during its four-season run.

After the Trojans disbanded after the 1882 season, the New York Gothams replaced them, taking many of the Troy players, including Welch. He resumed a heavy workload in 1883, throwing 426 innings in 54 games. This time he split pitching duties with John Montgomery Ward in what turned out to be Ward&#x27;s final season as a regular pitcher. In 1884, he went 39–21 with 345 strikeouts (a franchise record) and a 2.50 ERA.

===Strikeout record===
Welch holds the record for most consecutive batters struck out to begin a game, with nine, set on August 28, 1884. The record was not recognized for many years because of confusion over a dropped third strike. In the third inning of that game, a third strike was dropped by New York catcher Bill Loughran. As a result, that batter safely reached first base. Though modern scorekeeping credits a pitcher with a strikeout in this situation, such an event was not always recorded as a strikeout by sportswriters of that era. Baseball historian Harry Simmons helped Welch to receive official recognition of the feat in the 1940s.

Only three pitchers in the National League and two in the American League have come close to matching Mickey Welch&#x27;s record nine strikeouts. In the National League, Germán Márquez of the Colorado Rockies on September 26, 2018, Jacob deGrom of the New York Mets in 2014, and Jim Deshaies of the Houston Astros in 1986 struck out the first eight batters they faced. In the American League, Carlos Rodón of the Chicago White Sox in 2016 and Joe Cowley of the Chicago White Sox in 1986 struck out the first seven batters they faced.
Tom Seaver struck out 10 consecutive batters in 1970, though not at the beginning of the game.

===Middle career===

In 1885, he went 44–11 with 258 strikeouts and a 1.66 ERA. In the 1885 season, Welch and Keefe reunited as a two-man pitching rotation, with Keefe having a 32–13 win–loss record. The team, now called the Giants, had an incredible record of 85–27, with Welch winning 17 consecutive games at one point, but finished second to the Chicago White Stockings, who finished with a record of 87–25.

Welch had negotiated a clause in his contract, beginning in 1884, that prevented the team from pitching him more than every other day. After the 1885 season, Welch was one of nine Giants players to form baseball&#x27;s first union, which was known as the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players. The players were upset about the way they had been treated by baseball owners. The reserve clause, which restricted player movement and tempered increases in player salaries, had been instituted in 1880. The union spent the next several years recruiting new members and talking about the cause of player salaries. Though Welch was still an active player, he began saving money with the goal of opening a hotel.

In 1886, Welch won 33 games, which was second on the Giants to Keefe&#x27;s 44 victories. Despite this win total from Welch and Keefe, the team fell to third place in the league. Though they enjoyed a 47–12 record at the Polo Grounds, they were 28–32 while on the road that year. As Keefe and Welch were so overworked by 1887, the Giants picked up young pitchers Bill George and Ledell Titcomb, but both of them struggled and the Giants finished fourth.

===Later career===
Some credit Welch with becoming the first pinch hitter in major league history when he batted for Hank O&#x27;Day and struck out on September 10, 1889. However, a rule allowing pinch hitters in non-injury situations was not instituted until 1892. The first pinch-hitter under that rule is generally agreed to be Jack Doyle‚ on June 7‚ 1892.

The Giants won the 1889 World Series, but morale was low on the club. Relationships had become strained between players and owners across the league. The league was planning to implement a system of player ratings which would be used to determine player salaries. Welch and the other members of the Brotherhood were outraged by such a system and they began to plan a new baseball league, inviting players to join even if they were not Brotherhood members. The new eight-team league became known as the Players&#x27; League.

Before the Players&#x27; League began its season in 1890, Welch realized that he was coming to the end of his playing career. Saying that he was in baseball to earn money, Welch agreed to re-sign with the Giants on a three-year contract. Welch said that he had been willing to accept $2,000 less to play in the Players&#x27; League, but that deal fell through when the league could only guarantee one year of salary. He met with sharp criticism from Jim O&#x27;Rourke and other Brotherhood members, but the Players&#x27; League lasted only one season.

On April 24, 1890, with the score tied at 2 in the 7th inning between his Giants and the Boston Beaneaters‚ Welch got into an argument with umpire McDermott, an argument that resulted in the umpire declaring the game forfeited to host Boston. With Welch and Keefe still on the same club, the 1891 New York Giants had two 300-game winners. Until the 1980s, this was the only time that a major league team featured two pitchers with 300 wins each.

After one start in the 1892 season, Welch was sent to the minor leagues, earning a 16–14 record and a 0.87 ERA for the Eastern League&#x27;s Troy Trojans. He retired from baseball after the season, having compiled 307 victories, 210 losses, 1850 strikeouts and a career 2.71 ERA. As of 2015, Welch ranks third on the all-time list of career wild pitches. He had unique hitting skills for a pitcher, finishing his career with a .224 batting average, 93 doubles, 16 triples and 12 home runs. In addition to his 607 games pitched, Welch made 59 career appearances as an outfielder.

Welch attributed his durability to his ability to get hitters out with slower pitches. His main offerings to hitters were a curveball and a screwball.

==Personal life==
Author David Fleitz writes that Welch did not swear, smoke or drink hard liquor. Welch liked beer enough that he would write poems about it, reciting them for sportswriters or for fans on the carriage ride to the ballpark on game days. Sometimes his poetry also advertised local bars and restaurants. He did not drink nearly as much as many of his contemporary ballplayers. Giants bat boy Fred Engle speculated that this was because Welch had seen too many ballplayers fall prey to alcoholism.

Welch and his wife Mary had nine children, two of whom died in infancy. Mary died in 1936. During his career, Welch, along with most of his Giants teammates, lived at New York&#x27;s Broadway Central Hotel.

==After baseball==

After retiring as a player, Welch lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He joined an Elks lodge and remained in the organization for more than 50 years. He owned a saloon for a while and after he sold it, he went into the dairy business with one of his sons. Welch spent summers in New York. He worked as an attendant at the Polo Grounds. In a 1911 book on baseball history, Welch was described as the owner of a hotel in Troy, New York. In 1912, he returned to New York, serving as an usher at the Polo Grounds and captivating fans with tales of his playing days.

Welch and Keefe remained friends long after they retired from baseball. In July 1941, Welch had been staying with his grandson in Nashua when he had to be taken to a Concord hospital with complications of gangrene of the foot. He died there on July 30 at the age of 82 and was interred in Section 4, Range 17, Plot 2, Grave 6 of the Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens, New York, under his birth name of Walsh.

Welch was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1973. He was represented at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony by his elderly daughter, Julia Weiss.

<doc id="845521" wikidata="Q1187993" url="?curid=845521" title="GNU arch">
<text>GNU arch software is a distributed revision control system that is part of the GNU Project and licensed under the GNU General Public License. It is used to keep track of the changes made to a source tree and to help programmers combine and otherwise manipulate changes made by multiple people or at different times.

As of 2009, GNU arch&#x27;s official status is deprecation, and only security fixes are applied. Bazaar (or &#x27;bzr&#x27;) has since also been made an official GNU project and can thus be considered the replacement for GNU arch. It is not a fork of arch.

== Features ==
Being a distributed, decentralized versioning system, each revision stored using arch is uniquely globally identifiable; such identifier can be used in a distributed setting to easily merge or &quot;cherry-pick&quot; changes from completely disparate sources.

Being decentralized means that there is no need for a central server for which developers have to be authorized in order to contribute. As with other systems, a full read-only copy of a project is made accessible in an &quot;official&quot; repository via HTTP, FTP, or SFTP; but then, contributors are encouraged to make modifications and publish them in a public archive (repository) of their own, so that the head developer may manually merge changesets into the official repository.

To simulate the behavior of centralized revision control systems, the head developer could allow shell access (SSH) or write access (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV) to a server, allowing authorized users to commit to a central server. More often, GNU arch-managed projects have a lead benevolent dictator that merges changes from contributors.

GNU arch has several other features:

; Atomic commits : Commits are all-or-nothing. The tree must be in proper condition before the commit begins, and commits are not visible to the world until complete. If the commit is interrupted before this, it remains invisible and must be rolled back before the next commit. This avoids corruption of the archive and other users&#x27; checked-out copies.
; Changeset oriented : Instead of tracking individual files (as in CVS), GNU arch tracks changesets, which are akin to patches. Each changeset is a description of the difference between one source tree and another, and so a changeset can be used to produce one revision from another revision. Authors are encouraged to use one commit per feature or bugfix.
; Easy branching : Branching is efficient and can span archives. A branch (or &#x27;tag&#x27;) simply declares the ancestor revision, and development continues from there.
; Advanced merging : Due to the permanent record of all ancestors and merged revisions, merging can take into account which branch contains which patch, and can do three-way merging based on a shared ancestor revision.
; Cryptographic signatures : Every changeset is stored with a hash to prevent accidental corruption. Using an external file signing program (such as GnuPG or another PGP client), these hashes can also optionally be signed, preventing unauthorized modification if the archive is compromised.
; Renaming : All files and directories can be easily renamed. These are tracked by a unique ID rather than by name, so history is preserved, and patches to files are properly merged even if filenames differ across branches.
; Metadata tracking : The permissions of all files are tracked. Symbolic links are supported and are tracked the same way as files and directories.

== History and maintainership ==

=== GNU arch version 1 and tla ===
The original author and maintainer of GNU arch was Thomas Lord who started the project in 2001. The command used to manipulate GNU arch repositories is tla, an initialism for &quot;Tom Lord&#x27;s Arch&quot;. Lord started GNU arch as a collection of shell scripts to provide an alternative to CVS. In 2003, &quot;arch&quot; became part of the GNU project.

The GNU arch project forked several times, resulting in both Canonical Ltd.&#x27;s now abandoned Baz fork and Walter Landry&#x27;s ArX project. Both forks provoked a hostile reaction: the ArX fork was due to a serious dispute in direction and Lord was strongly critical of Canonical&#x27;s approach to announcing the Baz project.

In August 2005 Lord announced that he was resigning as the maintainer of GNU arch and recommended that Baz become the main GNU arch project. However, this did not happen: the Baz fork was abandoned by Canonical in favour of the separate Bazaar project, with the 1.5 release of Baz being scrapped in 2006. In October, 2005, Andy Tai announced that Lord and the Free Software Foundation had accepted his offer to be the maintainer of GNU arch. Tai subsequently merged many features from Baz back into tla, but in March 2008 indicated that tla was no longer under active development and was no longer competitive with other version control systems.

=== revc ===

revc was a prototype revision control project by Thomas Lord that he intended to become GNU arch 2.0, designed to be a radical departure from tla and to draw many ideas from the Git revision control system. It was announced in June 2005, the first pre-release was in July and the last in August, just prior to Lord&#x27;s resignation as maintainer. revc only had 10 core commands and Lord intended to eliminate restrictive namespaces, complicated file naming conventions and increase the speed.

As of 2008 the last pre-release, 0.0x2, of revc is still available and Lord was still interested in some of the ideas in GNU arch but did not have the resources to resume development of revc.
Thomas Lord died in June 2022.

== Criticism ==
Perhaps the most common criticism of GNU arch is that it is difficult to learn, even for users who have experience with other Version control systems. In particular, GNU arch has a large number of commands, which can be intimidating for new users and some design elements arguably too strongly enforce Lord&#x27;s taste in version control practices.

Some also criticize GNU arch for using very unusual file naming conventions (), which can create difficulties for using it in scripts, some shells, and in porting it to non-Unix operating systems. GNU arch has been criticised for having a slow running time as part of a design decision to lessen internal code complexity.

<doc id="845523" wikidata="Q5154389" url="?curid=845523" title="Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Class Struggle">
<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) is a communist party in India. The party is one of many working under the name of CPI(ML). The party general secretary was Kanu Sanyal. The name of the party is identical to the original CPI(ML) formed in 1969, of which Sanyal was also a key leader, but Sanyal has stated that his party is not the same as this party .

==History==
The present party was formed through a merger of Sanyal&#x27;s Communist Organization of India (Marxist–Leninist) and Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Unity Initiative in June 2003. In November 2003 Communist Party of Indian Union (Marxist–Leninist) merged with the party. The strength of the party is mainly concentrated to Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

The party central organ is Class Struggle.

In the elections 2004 CPI (ML) launched five candidates to the Lok Sabha and one to the Andhra Pradesh assembly.

Results from the Lok Sabha elections:
* Parvathipuram, Andhra Pradesh: Uooyaka Mutyalu 13895 votes (2.1%)
* Jhargram, West Bengal: Leba Chand Tudu 9422 votes (1,18%)
* Ranchi, Jharkhand: Anjani Kumar Pandey 2044 votes (0,29%)
* Darjeeling, West Bengal: Raju Bhatta 11112 votes (1,25%)

Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2004 the party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Red Flag had taken the initiative to form a united front of communist group. The two parties agreed to merge at a unity conference in late January 2005. Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red flag split before the merger and one section of that party merge with CPI (ML).

Just ahead of the 2006 West Bengal legislative election two regional party leaders, Somnath Chatterjee (not to be confused with the Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee) from Ukhra and Pradip Banerjee from Kolkata, broke away from the party.

In 2009 January CPI (ML) Red flag faction split from the CPI (ML) and formed its own group. 2010 March 23 Kanu Sanyal expired and Viswam was elected as General Secretary of CPI (ML).

<text>Breach of the peace or disturbing the peace is a legal term used in constitutional law in English-speaking countries and in a public order sense in the United Kingdom. It is a form of disorderly conduct.

==Public order==
===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
In England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve &quot;a breach of the King&#x27;s peace&quot;, and all indictments formerly concluded &quot;against the peace of our Lord the King, his crown and dignity&quot; before the passage of the Indictments Act 1915 and the Rules that formed that Act&#x27;s first schedule. The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many United States state constitutions, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the &quot;crown&quot; part or substituting &quot;government&quot;. For example, New Jersey&#x27;s is &quot;against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same&quot;.

Historically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal courts assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the sheriff and of lords of manor and franchises, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from civil wrongs or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of Justice of the Peace.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, which refers to riotous and barratous behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as &quot;when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance&quot;.

The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the common law and therefore an &#x27;any person&#x27; power of arrest and entry both within the same definition.

Section 17(5) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This &quot;offence&quot; definition and power of arrest are contained under the common law definition of &quot;breach of the peace&quot;. Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws Alfred the Great consolidated into the common law approximately 1,000 years before the modern constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. 

In England and Wales, breach of the peace is a civil proceeding (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, &#x27;beyond reasonable doubt&#x27;, rather than the civil standard of proof, &#x27;on the balance of probabilities&#x27;. Sometimes the Crown Prosecution Service conduct the case on behalf of the police, but the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor. Breach of the peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction. In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to &quot;prevent a further breach of the peace&quot; which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a breach of the peace would occur.

The only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to bind over the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980.

Nowadays a person causing a public disturbance may be arrested for, and/or charged with, causing harassment, alarm or distress contrary to the Public Order Act 1986.

===Scotland===
There are major differences between English law and Scots law with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence.

Breach of the peace consists of &quot;conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community&quot;.

A constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring).

Breach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes &quot;rowdiness&quot; or &quot;brawling&quot;) and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include persistently following someone, delivering threatening letters and &quot;streaking&quot; or &quot;mooning&quot;.

One of the leading cases in Scots law is that of &quot;Smith v Donnelly&quot;, a case concerning a Faslane protester.

Section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 created an offence of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner in a way likely to cause a reasonable person to suffer fear or alarm, similar to the Section 5 Public Order act in England and Wales. This subsists alongside breach of the peace.

===United States===
In the United States, prosecutions for breach of the peace are subject to constitutional constraints. In &quot;Terminiello v. City of Chicago&quot; (1949), the United States Supreme Court held that an ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which &quot;stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance&quot; was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Justice Douglas stated: &quot;Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.&quot;

In &quot;Cox v. Louisiana&quot; (1965), the Supreme Court held that a Louisiana statute criminalizing breaches of the peace was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it would allow persons to be prosecuted for expressing unpopular views. The statute read in part:

Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby ... crowds or congregates with others ... in or upon ... a public street or public highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building ... and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on ... when ordered so to do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person ... shall be guilty of disturbing the peace.

On the state level, at least one court has reasoned that the essence of a breach of the peace was the potential to cause a disruption in tranquility or to promote the threat of violence, stating that a breach of the peace was that which &quot;disturbs or threatens to disturb the tranquility enjoyed by the citizens&quot;.

<text>Fratton is a residential and formerly industrial area of Portsmouth in Hampshire, England. Victorian style terraced houses are dominant in the area, typical of most residential areas of Portsmouth. Fratton has many discount shops and &quot;greasy spoon&quot; cafes, as well as The Bridge Shopping Centre containing an Asda.

== History ==
The name Fratton was once Froddington, a Saxon name which originally meant &quot;Frodda&#x27;s Farm&quot; or &quot;Frodda&#x27;s village&quot;. A pub on Fratton Road is still named &quot;The Froddington Arms&quot;.

There is a commemorative plaque by the petrol station near Fratton Asda, marking where a bomb shelter was hit by a bomb on 10 January 1941, killing 80 people.

Goldsmith&#x27;s Farm and Fratton Common were part of the original small rural village originally called Froddington, the only visible evidence of this being the presence of a public house, &quot;The Froddington Arms&quot; on the western side of Fratton Road. Froddington was one of the three small settlements on Portsea Island mentioned in the Domesday Book. Due to developments during the industrial age, more of the surrounding land was absorbed by Portsmouth in the 1870s and 1880s, principally by new housing developments.

==Politics==
In the UK Parliament, Fratton is represented as part of the Portsmouth South constituency. Since 2017, Stephen Morgan of the Labour Party has been the member of parliament for Portsmouth South. 
In local government, Fratton is a Portsmouth City Council ward. It was formed for the 2002 Portsmouth City Council election as the successor to the pre-2002 Fratton ward.
 indicates seat up for election.

==Trivia==

* Fratton has been adopted in navy and local slang as a euphemism for the withdrawal method of contraception, &quot;getting off at Fratton&quot;, due to Fratton railway station being the last stop before Portsmouth&#x27;s busiest and largest station - Portsmouth &amp; Southsea railway station. However, Royal Naval personnel most commonly use Portsmouth Harbour railway station, which is the end of the line and a short walk from the entrance to the Royal Naval Dockyard.
* Despite its well known name, Portsmouth F.C.&#x27;s Fratton Park stadium is not built in the Fratton district of Portsmouth, it was actually built between 1898 and 1899 on farmland around the (then) village of Milton on the eastern side of Portsea Island. The Fratton Park stadium is still within the neighbouring Milton district of Portsmouth, shown by the Portsmouth FC postal code, &quot;PO4 8RA&quot; which has a &quot;PO4&quot; prefix Milton district postal code, not a Fratton (and Portsmouth city centre) &quot;PO1&quot; prefixed code. The streets and houses immediately around Fratton Park are officially designated as being within the &quot;Milton Ward&quot; district for local and national governmental elections. The boundary line between Fratton and Milton is marked along the Portsmouth Direct Line railway line. Fratton Park is located south of the railway line and is therefore within the Milton district.
* Fratton Park&#x27;s name was deliberately (and misleadingly) chosen in 1899 to persuade users of Fratton railway and tram station that Portsmouth FC&#x27;s football ground was nearer to convenient transport links than it actually was. Fratton railway station is approximately one mile away from Fratton Park, about a ten-minute walk along Goldsmith Avenue.

<text>Vaska Ilieva (; February 21, 1923 – May 4, 2001) was a legendary Macedonian leading folk singer from Yugoslavia and North Macedonia.

== Career ==
She started her career as a dancer and singer in the State Ensemble Tanec in the early 1950s. Her style of singing and the songs she sang brought her wide popularity throughout Macedonia, the rest of the former Yugoslavia, the Balkans and throughout the worldwide Macedonian diaspora. She was referred to as the &quot;Queen&quot; of traditional Macedonian music.

Ilieva was awarded various honours from many European countries and toured Europe the Americas and Australia, where there is a large Macedonian community. Her repertoire of over 800 songs earned her a reputation as one of the most versatile and popular Macedonian female artists. Since the mid-1980s, Ilieva focused on interpreting patriotic songs, reflecting popular opinion and preceding the independence of the Republic of Macedonia.

She died on 4 May 2001 in her native Skopje at the age of 77, leaving behind a rich cultural and spiritual heritage. In her honor, and on the occasion of 10 years since her death, a concert was organised and held at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet, featuring famous musical names, as well as her successor Susana Spasovska.

<text>The Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century, or PARIS21, was established in November 1999 by the United Nations, the European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank as a response to the UN Economic and Social Council resolution on the goals of the UN International Conference on Financing for Development. PARIS21&#x27;s main objective is &quot;to achieve national and international development goals and to reduce poverty in low and middle income countries&quot;. In pursuit of this, PARIS21 &quot;facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision-making, and coordinates donor support to statistics&quot;. The PARIS21 Secretariat is hosted within the Statistics and Data Directorate of the OECD in Boulogne-Billancourt, France.

==History==
The OECD Development Assistance Committee hosted a meeting of 100 statistical and policy officials from developing countries, international organisations, regional banks and bilateral donors on 18–19 November 1999 to discuss the challenges faced by policymakers due to outdated, insufficient statistics, and the challenges faced by statisticians due to limited resources and low priority status in government. As a result of this meeting, PARIS21 was established as a &quot;global partnership of national, regional and international statisticians, analysts, policy-makers, development professionals and other users of statistics&quot;. The primary purpose of PARIS21 is to &quot;promote, influence and facilitate statistical capacity development and the better use of statistics&quot;. In function, PARIS21 acts as a &quot;forum and a network&quot; for relevant stakeholders &quot;interested in the production and use of statistics to support economic and social development and to promote better governance&quot;. Members of this partnership work to advocate for better statistics production and use in both &quot;policy and technical domains&quot;, and push for more and better funding for data and statistics in development.

==Structure==
The PARIS21 Secretariat, led by the PARIS21 Secretariat Executive Head, is responsible for coordinating Partnership activities and &quot;implementing the day-to-day work programme of PARIS21 as approved by the Board and the Executive Committee&quot;. The Board consists of stakeholder representatives from developing countries, bilateral donors and international organisations. The Board meets once a year to review the PARIS21 Programme of Work and to facilitate dialogue on general issues relating to the development and use of statistics. Outside of Board meetings, Secretariat activities are guided and monitored by a small Executive Committee consisting of members selected by the Board. This committee has the ability to organise task teams and ad hoc projects in the Board&#x27;s absence.

PARIS21&#x27;s governance agreements were most recently revised in December 2017. Only occurring twice since PARIS21&#x27;s inception (a revision was also made in November 2006), revisions to PARIS21&#x27;s governance agreements are made to &quot;reflect the evolution&quot; of PARIS21&#x27;s role based on feedback from the Board.

==Areas of work==
===National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS)===
PARIS21&#x27;s work involves assisting low- and middle-income countries to design, implement, and evaluate National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). NSDS provide an overall strategic vision of the development of a country&#x27;s national statistical system (NSS) in line with the data priorities of national, regional and international development policies. NSDS serves as a comprehensive framework for the coordination of all data ecosystem stakeholders as well as for international and bilateral assistance. It addresses issues related to the data production, dissemination, access and use, in addition to modernisation of the NSS.

===Advocacy===
As a partnership, PARIS21&#x27;s work involves connecting producers and users of statistics. It advocates for support to statistics at the international, regional and national levels. It produces a yearly Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), which documents the global status of technical and financial support to statistical development. At the country level, PARIS21 collaborates with individual national statistical systems to produce a Country Report on Support to Statistics (CRESS) examining the state of funding for statistics in the national statistical system. Additionally, PARIS21 organises in-country training sessions and workshops for national statistical offices, journalism and media professionals and others to develop skills in communicating statistics, data visualization and advocacy.

===Capacity development===
Statistical Capacity Development Outlook &amp; Monitor

In March 2019, PARIS21 published its Statistical Capacity Development Outlook report on &quot;current trends, challenges and emerging approaches in statistical capacity development&quot;. An online, interactive &quot;Statistical Capacity Monitor&quot; platform was launched in coordination with the report, aiming to &quot;play a role in guiding future efforts to develop capacity within and across national statistical systems and to support co-ordination efforts among donors&quot;. 13 As of January 2020, the PARIS21 Statistical Capacity Monitor features 109 indicators on statistical capacity and capacity development to &quot;support countries, donors and service providers to tailor capacity development programmes in statistics&quot;. The Monitor provides access to an evolving set of indicators on statistical capacity intended to offer insight on where countries stand in different areas of capacity. It &quot;facilitates country and regional comparisons across multiple dimensions of statistical capacity, presenting trends in key drivers (such as funding and legislation).”

Capacity Development 4.0

According to its website, PARIS21 coined the term &quot;Capacity Development 4.0&quot; in 2016 to describe a new way of undertaking capacity development in national statistical systems. Capacity Development 4.0 is defined as:&quot;the process through which a country’s national statistical system, its organisations and individuals, obtain, strengthen and maintain their abilities to collect, produce, analyse and disseminate high-quality data to meet user needs&quot;.This approach is intended to bring together new data stakeholders, better involves users and to promote a holistic view of statistical capacity development. It is meant to go beyond technical skills, and emphasises &quot;softer&quot; skills such as leadership, change management, advocacy and networking. In January 2020, PARIS21 published its Guidelines for Developing Statistical Capacity: A Roadmap for Capacity Development 4.0.

===Innovation===
Advanced Data Planning Tool

PARIS21 launched its Advanced Data Planning Tool (ADAPT) in 2017 as a free cloud-based tool for national statistical offices and &quot;other data producers to adapt their data production to the priority data needs from policy makers&quot;. ADAPT was designed for data demand and supply analysis, developing of NSDS and other data plans and to monitor data plan activities, including costing and budgeting. The tool itself can be customised to accommodate country-specific needs, and it offers support in multiple languages.

While ADAPT is an online tool, it is also used in face-to-face field workshops organised worldwide by PARIS21 and partners to train national statistical offices on data planning.

In 2019, PARIS21 introduced a gender-specific module to ADAPT.

Citizen Generated Data

PARIS21 works with national statistical offices to support the use of citizen-generated data (CGD) in official reporting. PARIS21&#x27;s support addresses areas of country-level advocacy, coordination and collaboration mechanisms and capacity development. PARIS21 also works to develop quality assurance frameworks for CGD validation and integration.

PARIS21 Academy

In January 2020, PARIS21 launched an e-learning platform called PARIS21 Academy which is open to anyone, but &quot;primarily serves staff from official statistical agencies and data users like journalists&quot;. The platform hosts multimedia content including e-learning modules on topics such as data planning, gender statistics, data communication, financing data for development, trust in data and statistics, and statistical capacity development.

===Supporting gender statistics===
PARIS21 collaborates with UN Women since 2018 under the latter&#x27;s flagship programme &quot;Women Count&quot; to support gender statistics at the global, regional and national level. As part of this collaboration, PARIS21 – in cooperation with national and international experts in gender statistics – developed a Gender Statistics Assessment Framework to help countries evaluate the state of gender statistics in terms of data and capacity gaps. The assessment is meant to provide input on mainstreaming the gender perspective in national strategies for the development of statistics, a process which is currently underway in Cambodia and El Salvador (as of January 2020). PARIS21&#x27;s assessment process has also been piloted in the Dominican Republic, Egypt, the Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives and Senegal. The integration of gender statistics in the national statistical strategies is intended to secure political interest and funding which can enhance production and dissemination.

PARIS21 is also working to improve data dissemination and communication of gender statistics through media engagement and data visualization trainings. An e-learning module on communicating gender statistics for journalists and producers of statistics is being developed for the PARIS21 Academy. PARIS21 is also reporting on developing partners&#x27; support to gender statistics through a special module in its PRESS report. The gender module of the PRESS survey provides valuable information on bilateral and multilateral donor support to projects targeting gender statistics.

===Role in international activities===
Bern Network on Financing Data for Development

The Bern Network on Financing Data for Development formed in 2019 and is described by PARIS21 as an &quot;open, multi-stakeholder alliance to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by promoting more and better financing for data&quot;. The Bern Network is focused on low-income countries and fragile states, working to &quot;support better identification of needs, improved investment proposals, better co-ordination at the country level, and bridge domestic and external financial and technical support for low-capacity countries&quot;.

In December 2019, the Bern Network released a paper on its five action areas to improve the quality and quantity of funding for development data, building on an earlier report published in July 2019.

Network members are currently working to develop concrete commitments on more and better funding for data to be launched at the United Nations World Data Forum on Sustainable Development Data 2020 in Bern, Switzerland.

Cross Regional Engagement / Cross Regional Fora

PARIS21&#x27;s annual Cross Regional Fora began in 2015 as a platform of engagement and exchange to bring together multiple stakeholders from the national, regional and global levels to discuss good practices, experiences and challenges surrounding various themes in statistics. The fora also serve as a venue to advance recommendations for improving current statistical practices, while also contributing to knowledge creation and sharing. The most recent Cross Regional Forum in 2019 centred on trust in data and official statistics. Participants represented national statistical offices, international organisations, civil society and academia. The 2019 Forum also launched the PARIS21 2020 Trust Initiative, a project funding opportunity for proposals of how to &quot;enhance trust&quot; in data at the country level.

<doc id="845565" wikidata="Q725008" url="?curid=845565" title="George Henry Williams">
<text>George Henry Williams (March 26, 1823April 4, 1910) was an American judge and politician. He served as chief justice of the Oregon Supreme Court, was the 32nd Attorney General of the United States, and was elected Oregon&#x27;s U.S. senator, and served one term. Williams, as U.S. senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction of the southern states to allow for an orderly process of re-admittance into the United States. Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast. As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan. He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states. President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor. Williams ruled that the &quot;Virginius&quot;, a gun-running ship delivering men and munitions to Cuban revolutionaries, which was captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag. However, he also argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members. Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams&#x27;s opposition to U.S. Attorney A. C. Gibbs, his former law partner, who refused to stop investigating Republican fraud in the special congressional election that resulted in a victory for Democrat James Nesmith.

In 1875, Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney General after his wife was accused of taking bribes from the custom house firm &quot;Pratt &amp; Boyd&quot;, which attempted to persuade the U.S. Justice Department to drop litigation against the company. After his resignation, Williams took part in the effort to count Florida ballots for Rutherford B. Hayes during the controversial presidential election of 1876. Williams returned to Oregon, resumed private law practice, and was elected Portland&#x27;s mayor, serving two terms from 1902 to 1905. Williams, at the age of 83, was indicted for not enforcing restrictions on gambling; he was acquitted and served out the rest of his term as mayor.

==Early life and law career==
George Henry Williams was born in upstate New York, New Lebanon, Columbia County, on March 26, 1823. When he was very young his family moved to Onondaga County, where was educated in public and private schools, including &quot;Pompey Academy&quot;. Williams studied law under Daniel Gott, and was admitted to the bar in 1844. Williams then moved to Iowa Territory, where he practiced law in Fort Madison. After Iowa was admitted to statehood, Williams was elected district judge in 1847, serving until 1852. In 1853, Williams was appointed Chief Justice of Oregon Territory by President Franklin Pierce. At the 1857 Oregon Constitutional Convention, Williams urged that slavery be made illegal in Oregon as a requirement for statehood. Williams advocated unsuccessfully that a woman&#x27;s property not be subject to her husband&#x27;s debts.

In the early years of the Oregon Supreme Court, the three justices also rode circuit and acted as trial level judges. As a presiding judge while riding circuit, Williams presided over the &quot;Holmes v. Ford&quot; case that freed a slave family since slavery was illegal in the territory. In 1857, he was a member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention held before the establishment of Oregon as a U.S. state. Williams remained on the court until 1858 when he resigned from the bench. He then moved to Portland, Oregon, where he resumed the practice of law.

Williams, a Democrat, supported Stephen Douglas during the presidential election of 1860. Williams attended the Oregon Union convention of 1862, having opposed slavery, and was the chairman of the Election Committee.

==U.S. Senator==

In 1864 Williams, having changed over to the Republican Party, was elected to the United States Senate; he served one term, from 1865 to 1871. In 1865, Sen. Williams, a Radical Republican, was appointed to the &quot;Committee on Finance and Public Lands&quot; and the &quot;Joint Committee on Reconstruction&quot;. In 1866 Williams authored the Tenure of Office Act, passed by Congress in 1867 over President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s veto, that limited the President in removing Cabinet officers. This act was vital to the Republican Party, having saved the offices of appointed Republicans throughout the United States. In 1867, he authored and supported the Military Reconstruction Act, passed by Congress over President Johnson&#x27;s veto, that authorized U.S. military control of the South. This act permanently restored and Reconstructed the formerly Confederate states in rebellion back into the United States in an orderly and peaceful manner using the strength of the U.S. military. In 1868, Williams and his senatorial colleague Henry W. Corbett voted guilty in President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial; Johnson was acquitted by one vote. Williams was defeated in the election of 1870.

==U.S. Joint High Commissioner==


In 1871, President Grant appointed Williams one of six U.S. Joint High Commissioners to negotiate a settlement treaty between Britain and the U.S. in Washington, D.C., over the Alabama Claims and America&#x27;s Northwest boundary between the U.S. and Canada. Six representatives had been chosen to represent British and Canadian interests making a total of twelve High Commissioners. Williams was chosen to be on the U.S. treaty commission due to his experience and career in the Pacific Northwest. Williams proved to be a valuable member of the U.S. Commission and served in this position with dignity. In addition to settling the Alabama claims against Britain for allowing Confederate ships to be armed in British ports, at stake was the U.S. Northwest border running through the Rosario Strait. The U.S. desired that the boundary run through the Haro Strait, however, this became a highly contentious issue between the U.S., Britain, and Canada. The Washington, D.C., treaty Commissioners finally decided that the Emperor of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm I, would settle the boundary matter. Williams was able to convince the Committee that the German Emperor needed to strictly interpret the Treaty of 1846 and that the boundary be determined by the most used channel, the Haro Strait. Through Williams&#x27;s efforts, the German Emperor finally chose the Haro Strait as the Northwest boundary between the U.S. and Canada; the U.S. received the San Juan Islands.

==U.S. Attorney General==
In December 1871, during later Reconstruction, President Grant appointed Williams as Attorney General of the United States; he served three years until 1875. His appointment was made to satisfy demands by Pacific Coast politicians that the region be represented in the cabinet. Williams was also the legal counsel for the Alaska Improvement Company in which Grant was a shareholder. President Grant&#x27;s southern Reconstruction policy worked primarily through Williams&#x27;s Justice Department supported by Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War, William W. Belknap.

===Prosecution of Klan===
Attorney General Williams continued to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan until December 1872 when he issued a clemency policy toward the South. The Justice Department had been inundated by multiple caseloads against the Klan and did not have the manpower to effectively prosecute all of them. Williams finished his prosecution of the remaining Klan cases in the Spring of 1873. Williams believed continued prosecutions of the Klan was unnecessary and was concerned over negative public reaction to the Klan prosecutions. The suppression of the Klan led to African American turnout at the polls throughout the South, and Grant was re-elected in part due to blacks voting for Grant.

===Toured the South (1872)===
During the presidential election of 1872, Attorney General Williams toured the Southern states advocating President Grant&#x27;s Southern Reconstruction policy through public speeches. Prominent Southern cities that Williams visited and spoke at included Richmond, Virginia; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina. Through Williams’ efforts, Southern states went over to the Republican ticket, including Virginia, South Carolina, and Arkansas. This was the last time that Republicans had a majority victory in the South after the Democratic Party took control of all of the Southern Reconstructed states in 1877, known as the “Solid South”. No Republican presidential candidate would win any former Confederate state until Warren G. Harding carried Tennessee in 1920, and the Democratic Party would carry a majority of former Confederate states in every presidential election until the party&#x27;s support for black civil rights caused the defection of almost all the region&#x27;s white voters in the 1968 election.

===Alabama election (1872)===
When election disputes occurred during the Alabama state elections in 1872; both state Democrats and Republicans appealed to U.S. Attorney General Williams for settlement. Both President Grant and Williams thoroughly consulted each other in considering a settlement for the contentious Alabama political crisis. On December 12, 1872, President Grant and George Henry Williams peacefully settled the disputed Alabama state elections between the Democrats and Republicans by issuing five resolutions to Governor David P. Lewis. Gov. Lewis and the Republican legislature agreed to the five resolutions that included a Democratic and Republican representative to make a coordinated count of a disputed election result in Marengo County. Williams had required that the current House resign and the House building be vacated before settling the disputed election returns. Williams also vacated the Alabama Senate while disputed senatorial elections were resolved. In addition to elections, Williams settled per diem compensation disputes for office holders.

===Louisiana election (1872)===
During the election of 1872, Louisiana was in political turmoil, having two rival factions contending for control of the state legislature. Democrat John D. McEnery and Republican William P. Kellogg both claimed to have won the governorship; both parties mired in charges of voting fraud. Federal troops led by William H. Emory, in charge of the Department of the Gulf, kept the peace during and immediately after the election. On December 3, Attorney General Williams, at the request of Kellogg, ruled that President Grant would enforce any decision by the United States District Courts. After multiple state Returning Boards failed to resolve the election, U.S. District Court Judge Edmund H. Darrell ordered that Kellogg was the winner of the Louisiana election.

In the meantime, on December 9, U.S. Marshal Stephen B. Packard, who was affiliated with the New Orleans Custom House Gang led by President Grant&#x27;s brother-in-law (James F. Casey), chose a legislature that impeached sitting Governor Henry Clay Warmoth and put in charge P. B. S. Pinchback, a Kellogg supporter, as the United States&#x27; first African American state governor. On December 14, Attorney General Williams informed Warmoth that President Grant recognized Kellogg as the rightful, elected governor of Louisiana. This action upset the McEnery faction, who believed that President Grant and Attorney General Williams had taken sides in a state election. On December 16, Attorney General Williams reaffirmed Kellogg&#x27;s election, Pinchback as the lawful governor of Louisiana, and recognized other elected Republican candidates and presidential electors.

===Virginius affair (1873)===

In October 1873, a privateer gun-running ship flying the American flag, the &quot;Virginius&quot;, secretly owned by Cuban insurgents during the Cuban Ten Years&#x27; War was captured by a Spanish warship. In November, a total of 53 crewmembers, including American and British seamen, were tried and executed by Spanish mercenary, Juan N. Burriel, in Santiago, Cuba. On December 17, the &quot;Virginius&quot; was turned over to the United States Navy according to an agreement between the U.S. and Spain. On the same day, after an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department, Attorney General Williams ruled that the &quot;Virginius&quot; had been purchased by fraud and did not have the legal right to carry the American flag, however, he argued that the Spanish did not have the right to capture it on open waters and execute American crewmen, since the United States only had the right to investigate if the &quot;Virginius&quot; had been legally registered in New York. Williams’ ruling on the ownership of the &quot;Virginius&quot; ship was a mixture of &quot;pretense, legality, and bluff&quot;. Through negotiations, 91 crewmembers were returned to New York and families of those Americans who were executed by Burriel were eventually awarded $80,000 reparations from Spain in 1875.

===Chief Justice nomination (1873)===

In December 1873, President Grant nominated Williams to become Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Initially, Grant had Senator Roscoe Conkling&#x27;s support for the nomination. However, rumor spread through Washington that Williams had used Justice Department funds to pay for his wife&#x27;s expensive carriage. Williams had drawn on Justice Department funds, replaced by himself, when banks suspended payment on checks during the Panic of 1873. Sen. Conkling believed under the circumstances the nomination should be revoked. In December 1873, after previously reporting the nomination to the Senate with a favorable recommendation, the Senate Judiciary Committee held two days of closed-door hearings concerning the controversy. This was the first recorded instance in which formal hearings are known to have been held on a Supreme Court nominee by a Senate committee. On January 9, 1874, an angered President Grant sent the Senate a letter that withdrew Williams&#x27;s name from nomination.

===Honored by New York Bar (1874) ===
On January 31, 1874, prominent members of the New York Bar and Bench attend a reception given by Col. Eliott F. Shepard in honor of U.S. Attorney General Williams. The extravagantly lighted party took place on No. 10 East 44 Street in New York from 8 pm to 10 pm. Williams had initially visited New York on vacation for a reunion with old friends. The Bernstein Band performed a series of popular musical opera arrangements. Prominent New York judges attended, including Justice Louis B. Woodruff and Justice Noah Davis. Almost 800 persons showed up in attendance including a future President, Collector of New York, Chester A. Arthur.

===Resignation and corruption (1875)===
President Grant forced Williams to resign in April 1875 upon a rumor in Washington, D.C., that Williams&#x27;s wife had accepted $30,000 in payment in order for Williams to drop litigation against alleged fraudulent activities of a New York mercantile house &quot;Pratt &amp; Boyd&quot;. Also under scrutiny was Williams’ wife&#x27;s purchase using government money of an expensive carriage in Washington, which she had equipped with liveried coachman and footman. Williams had also commingled his personal accounts with those of the Justice Department, paying personal checks using government money, although he made repayment. One of Grant&#x27;s reforming cabinet members Postmaster Marshall Jewell, informed Grant Congress was planning a formal investigation into William&#x27;s Justice Department. Senator Roscoe Conkling, Grant&#x27;s ally in the U.S. Senate, had asked Grant that Att. Gen. Williams step down from office. William&#x27;s resigned office, and Grant appointed reformer and famous New York lawyer Edwards Pierrepont for his replacement. Pierrepont made extensive investigations into the conduct of the U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals in the Southern states, exposing fraud and corruption, and gave specific reform orders to that were vigorously enforced, cleaning up the Justice Department.

==Later career==
In February 1876, Williams was part of a three-man defense team who defended Orville E. Babcock, President Grant&#x27;s military secretary, at the Whiskey Ring trial held in St. Louis. Babcock had been charged with secretive collusion with the ring, and throwing off investigators. The investigation into the Whiskey Ring was started by Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow to clean up Republican corruption. Babcock was acquitted.
After resigning Williams declined an offer from Grant to become the U.S. minister to Spain. George Williams campaigned for the election of Rutherford B. Hayes as president in 1876. During the controversial presidential election of 1876, Williams, now a private citizen, went to Florida to manage the Hayes ballot returns.

After the 1876 U.S. presidential election, Williams returned to his Portland private law practice. Williams supported women&#x27;s suffrage and the Oregon &quot;popular government&quot; movement.

In 1895, Williams published a compilation of &quot;Occasional Addresses&quot; gathered &quot;from newspapers and stray places&quot; that he had delivered as early as 1869, with the majority dating from 1885 to 1893. Intended primarily as a souvenir for friends, professional and political speeches were excluded. Among the 21 addresses presented are tributes delivered on the deaths of Generals U.S. Grant and W.T. Sherman and several prominent judges, and speeches bearing upon the history and growth of Portland, the study and practice of medicine, the militia, and the United States Supreme Court. Williams&#x27; address on the value of good thoughts was intended as advice to the 1891 graduating class of the high school at Portland.

On October 11, 1901, the Episcopal Church of America met in San Francisco to decide whether Episcopal clergymen could remarry divorced persons and discipline any Episcopal members who remarried. Former Attorney General Williams attended the meeting and opposed all restrictions by the Episcopal church on married and divorced persons and stated that such matters belonged in civil law as opposed to church law.

Williams was elected Portland&#x27;s mayor serving from 1902 to 1905. On January 4, 1905, Mayor Williams, at the age of 83 years, was indicted by a grand jury in Multnomah County for allegedly refusing to enforce laws that regulated gambling . Williams was charged for not closing down gambling facilities on July 13, 1904, that operated within four miles of Portland. Portland&#x27;s Chief of Police Charles H. Hunt&#x27;s indictment was similar to Mayor Williams&#x27;s indictment. Williams, however, was acquitted and served out the rest of his term in office.

On May 28, 1905, Mayor Williams gave a speech in honor of the opening of the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. Vice President Charles W. Fairbanks was the keynote speaker who attended the opening ceremony. President Theodore Roosevelt officially mechanically opened the ceremony by pressing a button in Washington, D.C.

==Death and burial==
Williams died April 4, 1910, in Portland and is buried at River View Cemetery in that city.

==Historical reputation==
Williams was the first presidential cabinet member appointed from Oregon.

Although Williams had some successes as U.S. Attorney general, he was not a reformer and was involved in corruption during his tenure in federal office. Historian Jean Edward Smith, critical of Williams, said whenever &quot;tested as attorney general he failed dismally.&quot; 

==Marriages and family==
Williams married Kate Van Antwerp in Iowa in 1850, and they had one daughter. He married a second time in 1867 to Kate Hughes George, and the couple adopted two children.

<doc id="845577" wikidata="Q6866460" url="?curid=845577" title="Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec">
<text>The title Minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec was accorded to full members of the Cabinet of Canada from the Campbell Ministry through the first months of Paul Martin government. Prior to the agency&#x27;s renaming in 1998, the position was termed Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development – Quebec.

Ministers responsible have included Jean Charest, Paul Martin, and John Manley.

In 2002, Claude Drouin became the only Secretary of State for the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec that was created to succeed from the former position of Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development – Quebec) which had existed since 1996 with Martin Cauchon in the position. When Prime Minister Paul Martin did away with the sub-Cabinet position of Secretary of State, he reverted the structure to how it had been constituted before 1996, with Industry Minister Lucienne Robillard assuming the title.

After the 2004 Canadian election the portfolio was cut loose as an autonomous office, the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, and given to Jacques Saada. It then passed to Jean-Pierre Blackburn and Denis Lebel.

The pre-2004 portfolio was revived when Pascale St-Onge was appointed responsible for it in 2021; she would return to the role in February 2025.

==Ministers==
Key:


Martin Cauchon handled most day-to-day responsibilities for this portfolio as &quot;Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development – Quebec)&quot; from January 25, 1996 to February 12, 1998, and continued as &quot;Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec)&quot; until January 14, 2002. His replacement, Claude Drouin, would handle virtually all responsibilities for this portfolio as &quot;Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec)&quot; for the remainder of the Chrétien Ministry.

The portfolio became a full-fledged ministerial posting, Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, in 2004.

<text>Wäinö Valdemar Aaltonen (8 March 1894 – 30 May 1966) was a Finnish artist and sculptor. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary describes him as &quot;one of the leading Finnish sculptors&quot;.

He was born to a tailor in the village of Karinainen, Finland. He became interested in art after being deaf as a child, and attended the School of Drawing of the Turku Art Association from age 16, or specifically between 1910 and 1915. He had spent many of the early years at this school studying painting under Victor Westerholm, but he was mainly self-taught as a sculptor. He learned the technics of treatment of marble with his relative Aarre Aaltonen, and by working as a trainee stonemason in Hirvensalo. Sculptor Felix Nylund was a substitute teacher in the art school in Turku for one season, and his work was inspiration for young Aaltonen.

A journey Aaltonen made to Italy in 1923 opened his eyes to cubist and futurist art. These elements can primarily be seen in his paintings.

As the Republic of Finland arose, and the First World War raged, he sculpted War Memorials. He soon became a nationalist icon, the exemplar Finn, establishing an exhibition in Stockholm in 1927. His sculpture is nationalist in nature, and he is noted for monumental figures and busts portraying citizens of Finland. An example is the 1925 sculpture of Paavo Nurmi, a cast of which is exhibited outside the Helsinki stadium. Another notable work is that of Jean Sibelius, a bust of 1928. These two works, like the main body of his work, are bronze casts—though he did work in stone and even glass. Though chiefly naturalistic, the cubist influence is also present here. He was one of the early 20th-century pioneers of direct carving.

When the new House of Parliament for Finland was built, architect Johan Sigfrid Sirén wished he could buy sculptures directly from Aaltonen. Instead, an open competition was announced, and Aaltonen&#x27;s &quot;Work and the Future&quot; was selected as the winner. The series of gilded plaster sculptures that Aaltonen completed in 1932 were cast in bronze after his death.

Aaltonen was married four times. His first wife was singer Aino Alisa Pietikäinen from 1920, second wife actor Elsa Emilia Rantalainen from 1931, third wife gallerist in Galerie Artek Elvi Elisabet Hernell from 1942 and fourth wife medical doctor Marie Elisabeth Maasik from year 1961. His son Matti Aaltonen became an architect, who designed e.g. Wäinö Aaltonen museum in Turku.

A large collection of his works are on permanent exhibition at the Wäinö Aaltonen Museum of Art in Turku. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="845589" wikidata="Q1074284" url="?curid=845589" title="Exiles (Marvel Comics)">
<text>The Exiles are a group of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics commonly associated with The X-Men. They feature in three series, &quot;Exiles&quot;, &quot;New Exiles&quot;, and &quot;Exiles&quot; vol. 2. The Exiles consists of characters from different universes, or realities, which have been removed from time and space in order to correct problems (often called &quot;hiccups&quot;) in various alternate worlds and divergent timelines in the Marvel Multiverse.

Created by writer Judd Winick and artist Mike McKone, Exiles features a revolving team roster with new characters introduced and others replaced when they are killed or returned to their home reality. The series is notable for the number of characters who stay dead, in contrast to the frequent resurrections that occur in the main Marvel and DC continuities. It has featured familiar characters or settings from previous Marvel storylines, such as the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;House of M&quot;.

The first volume of &quot;Exiles&quot; ran for 100 issues, ending after a crossover with the members of New Excalibur in &quot;X-Men: Die by the Sword&quot; and the one-shot &quot;Exiles: Days of Then and Now&quot;. In March 2008 &quot;New Exiles&quot; began with Chris Claremont and artist Tom Grummett at the helm. Writer Jeff Parker and artist Salvador Espin relaunched the series with a new #1 in April 2009, but the book was canceled after only six issues.

==Publication history==
&quot;Exiles&quot; was created by Mike Marts, Mike Raicht, Judd Winick and also artists Mike McKone and Jim Calafiore. &quot;Exiles&quot; was created after a period of development aimed at creating a new &quot;What If?&quot; book for Marvel.

Raicht and Winick would develop the initial formula of &quot;Exiles&quot;&#x27; reality-hopping adventures. Chuck Austen came aboard as interim writer after Winick&#x27;s move to DC Comics. Tony Bedard took over, writing roughly half the series, from #46-89. Chris Claremont came onboard as of issue #90 and ended the series with the crossover &quot;X-Men Die by the Sword&quot;, before restarting the series as &quot;New Exiles&quot;. &quot;New Exiles&quot; ran for 18 issues before being canceled. A few months later the series was restarted again with a second volume of &quot;Exiles&quot;, written by Jeff Parker. This relaunch only lasted 6 issues before being canceled as well. A third series was launched as part of Marvel Legacy, written by Saladin Ahmed joined by the art team of Javier Rodriguez, Alvaro Lopez, and Jordie Bellaire and Joe Caramagna.

A number of artists have penciled the series including Mike McKone, Jim Calafiore, Kev Walker, Clayton Henry, Mizuki Sakakibara, Casey Jones, Steve Scott, Paul Pelletier, and Tom Mandrake. Tom Grummett, Roberto Castro, Paco Diaz, and Tim Seeley worked on &quot;New Exiles&quot;.

==Fictional team biography==

The Exiles team originally consisted of Blink (Clarice Ferguson, from the Age of Apocalypse), Mimic (Calvin Rankin), Magnus Lensherr (son of Magneto and Rogue), Thunderbird (John Proudstar), Nocturne (Talia Josephine &quot;T.J.&quot; Wagner, daughter of Nightcrawler and Scarlet Witch), and Morph. The team has since gone through a multitude of line-ups with Morph and Blink remaining the only original Exiles.

===First Series===
====Tallus====
Initially, the Exiles are employed by the Timebroker to fix broken realities. The Tallus is a communications device, which is worn by the leader of the group in order to communicate with the Timebroker. Through it, he would assign missions to the team and inform them of any changes, etc. Blink wears the Tallus in the beginning, but it is later transferred to Sabretooth when Blink rebels against the Timebroker. Mimic also wears the Tallus for a time in Blink&#x27;s absence. It is now used as a means of communication between its wearer and whoever is operating the Crystal Palace on various missions. It has a slightly different appearance for each wearer. For the first time ever, Sabertooth has used the Tallus to transport himself back to the Crystal Palace, without anyone on the other side recalling him.

====Exiles====
When Magnus dies, he is replaced by Sunfire (Mariko Yashida). Sasquatch (Heather Hudson) arrives when Thunderbird becomes comatose during a battle with the world-eating Galactus.

The Exiles then discover there is a second team conscripted by the Timebroker, Weapon X, whose missions typically involve killing or maiming innocents and heroes. The two teams join forces to rescue a group of children from a Sentinel prison camp. However, the teams are told the second stage of the mission is to kill one of the children – David Richards (son of Rachel Summers and Franklin Richards) – who will apparently grow up to become a powerful supervillain. Weapon X is willing to kill him, but the Exiles are not and the two teams fight until the Timebroker intervenes. Sabretooth (of the Weapon X team) agrees to stay behind and raise David Richards himself.

The Timebroker sends Blink home after a visit to a world plagued by a variant of the Legacy Virus, since the team had repaired her personal broken chain in time and Magik (Illyana Rasputin) takes her place. Mimic then replaces Blink as leader, gaining the Tallus.

The Exiles arrive in the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616) where they meet the X-Men after Havok&#x27;s canceled wedding. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the &quot;Mutant X&quot; universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the &quot;Mutant X&quot; Havok&#x27;s consciousness.

After Sunfire is killed by a Brood-infected Mimic, she is replaced by the Exiles&#x27; former teammate Blink. During the next mission, the Exiles and Weapon X are forced to battle each other until only six remain alive. Magik is killed by King Hyperion when she attempts to switch sides and betray the Exiles. King Hyperion is eventually defeated by Blink, who teleports his own heat vision into his back, paralyzing him. Gambit (of Weapon X) is allowed to deliver the killing blow against King Hyperion with a kinetically charged sword of the slain Magik which causes an explosion that kills them both, leaving five Exiles alive and their mission complete.

The Exiles visit the main Marvel Universe for a second time where they are joined by Namora, who replaces Magik, and are instructed to &quot;leave their possessions and earn their wings&quot;. Reed Richards deduces this means they are to leave Nocturne behind (whose power involves possession) and have Beak join the Exiles, which is confirmed by the Timebroker.

====Timebrokers====
The team is told by The Celestials to &quot;beware the Timebreaker [sic], he is not what he seems&quot;. After this, the Timebroker&#x27;s behavior becomes increasingly strange. Heather Hudson is removed from the team without explanation and replaced with former Weapon X member Sabretooth. The Tallus orders the Exiles to kill Mimic and despite their refusal, they are allowed to move onto a new mission (normally a mission &quot;must&quot; be completed for the Exiles to move on). Next, the Timebroker replaces Beak with Holocaust, which they are informed is a punishment for disobeying previous orders.

Eventually, the Exiles break free of the Timebroker and stage a raid on Panoptichron (also known as the &quot;Crystal Palace&quot;), home of the Timebroker and a location from which many parallel universes can be monitored. Here they discover that the Timebroker is an alien race of bug-like beings that found the Panoptichron and accidentally broke a series of timelines. Lacking the power to repair the timelines, they concocted this scheme of recruiting heroes from various worlds to do their work for them. Not only that, all previously &quot;returned&quot; heroes are actually in Panoptichron, frozen in blocks, along with the killed heroes. As a final twist, the evil King Hyperion has fully regenerated from being blown up by Gambit, broken free of his stasis and has taken over Panoptichron. The Exiles are nearly defeated with both Namora and Holocaust dying in the battle. Beak returns from stasis and saves the day by calling on two good versions of Hyperion for help, fulfilling his destiny as an Exile. King Hyperion is subdued and exiled to his home reality which is completely devoid of life. Only Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sabretooth, Beak, and Heather Hudson remain to pick up the pieces.

====World Tour====
The Exiles then return to Earth-616 to take Beak home. Unfortunately, Earth-616 is dominated by the House of M. During their stay, the Exiles run afoul of the body-hopping serial killer Proteus, who steals data from the Panoptichron and escapes from Earth-616, leaving Beak depowered back home. The Exiles chase Proteus through several realities, including an alternate version of the New Universe, an alternate version of 2099, Squadron Supreme, Future Imperfect, and &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;, before finally bringing Proteus down by trapping him in Morph’s body, which does not decay, unlike all of Proteus’ other host bodies. During the &quot;World Tour&quot; of hunting down Proteus, Mimic is possessed by Proteus and dies, forcing the Exiles to pick up new members Longshot, Spider-Man 2099, and Power Princess to restore their diminished numbers.

====Post-World Tour====
The Exiles begin cleaning out the stasis gallery of former Exiles and Weapon X members and send them back home. Iron Man, Daredevil, and Angel are sent back to their respective realities alive, while every other Earth with a missing superhuman holds a funeral. Blink, at the suggestion of Power Princess, takes Mimic home to be buried with his X-Men instead of burying him in Panoptichron. Spider-Man, Sabretooth, and Heather Hudson all decide to visit their home realities. Unfortunately, the Timebreakers ditch the Exiles when the Timebreakers believe that they are not saving realities as they should be. However, after using several squads of Wolverines to complete the next mission and failing, Logan (from Days of Future Past) and young James Howlett convince the Timebreakers that the Exiles are needed. The Exiles finally resume their reality-saving missions for the first time since they discovered Panoptichron when they save a reality where the Silver Surfer has already destroyed the Earth and is trying to destroy Galactus, who is the restorer of worlds in this reality.

Then, Heather discovers an Earth inhabited by a disturbingly close approximation of the original Exiles team, complete with their own Timebroker. After the &quot;classic Exiles&quot; fight &quot;the all-new Exiles&quot; (as Morph put it), it is later revealed that the whole thing was a scheme orchestrated by the Grandmaster, who seeks revenge on the Exiles for freeing Professor X on their first mission and ruining a bet. The Exiles, past and present, join forces with the Wrecking Crew of that Earth to defeat the Grandmaster. The current team then leaves the Earth in the hands of the approximation Exiles.

The Exiles then take three weeks to save a chain of cracked realities, injuring Blink, Morph, and Spider-Man. They also discover that Proteus is possibly immune to metal while in Morph’s body. Meanwhile, former Exile Thunderbird, is in the stasis gallery, dreaming of what might have been had he not become comatose.

====Enter Psylocke====
Power Princess leaves the team to return to the Squadron Supreme and Psylocke is brought on board to replace her. Blink, Longshot, and Spider-Man are brainwashed by HYDRA leaving only Sabretooth to pick up Morph and Psylocke. They are sent to kill Reed Richards. Slaymaster&#x27;s arrival makes them fail as Betsy faints before killing Reed. The world is erased, with the Exiles still there, but it is magically restored by Reed Richards, and Valeria Richards&#x27; amulet restores the world&#x27;s population because they were being stored in the amulet. The Exiles are still there so they can help Psylocke recover from wounds inflicted by Wolverine, and to help rebuild the planet. Meanwhile, another Slaymaster slays another Psylocke on another world.

After the Exiles return to Panoptichron, they find it empty, with no equipment, Timebreakers, or Heather. Blink and Morph eventually visit Heather, who thought the Exiles were dead and left Panoptichron. Heather is now pregnant and out of commission, so Psylocke stays behind to learn more about the Panoptichron while the other Exiles resume their missions. There she experiences visions which warn her of something bad to come, and an alternate version of Kitty Pryde appears from nowhere with no warning. The Exiles go to a seemingly perfect world led by Victor Von Doom but when Blink is caught by Reed Richards she begins to discover what hides behind this facade. She then recruits Longshot and Morph, who also sense something amiss with this world. They flee with that world&#x27;s Reed to begin a resistance. Meanwhile, Spider-Man 2099 meets Gwen Stacy and Sabretooth has a one-night stand with this world&#x27;s Invisible Woman. In reality, she was assigned to get close to him so Doom could copy the Tallus, which he does. He then sends a team of soldiers to Panoptichron. They take out Psylocke and assume Kitty Pryde is a freaked out child, though she appears to be faking that. The soldiers are attacked by Thunderbird, who is no longer comatose. Kitty Pryde (who goes by Cat), uses her phasing powers to create a diversion long enough to allow Thunderbird to free Psylocke. Together, they defeat the soldiers and send them home, just in time for them to see Doom&#x27;s defeat, whose Earth is destroyed by Reed Richards as there is no way to turn the humans back to their normal emotional state.

As a result the Exiles are scattered to various dimensions, much like Union Jack had done previously. Psylocke, Thunderbird, and Cat are able to work on the equipment and retrieve Blink, Morph, and Sabretooth, and new members Mystiq and Rogue are brought along. Spider-Man 2099 finds a girlfriend and stays on the world on which he landed. Longshot, once again, got lucky and landed in the Crystal Palace after the transport went wrong.

====&quot;Die by the Sword&quot;====

Psylocke and Thunderbird travel to Earth-616 to visit Captain Britain and Nocturne during New Excalibur&#x27;s victory party. During the party, Captain Britain is wounded by a strike force led by an armored lady called Rouge. While Betsy tries to care for her brother everybody else tries to fight, even Dazzler and Pete Wisdom, who were about to have sex, but, realizing they cannot win they teleport to the Panoptichron. There, Dazzler discovers that Longshot, while alive, doesn&#x27;t remember her and is about to kill herself to ease her pain when Mystiq comes to talk her out of it. TJ happily reunites with her former teammates while Sage is deemed the best option to care for Brian. Meanwhile, Cat, using the scanner, realizes that Roma and Saturnyne are in trouble. The Corps then suffers a lot of losses, despite Saturnyne&#x27;s intervention. While Cat checks on Brian, Blink, Morph, Sabertooth, Thunderbird, and Dazzler join the battlefield. Dazzler battles Rouge-Mort, who has badly wounded Roma, and Longshot gets concerned about her, making both himself and Sage wonder why/how, while Morph battles Jaspers by morphing into the Fury but his plan is quickly foiled. Sage, Psylocke, and Wisdom recruit Albion to their cause, who proves to be a match for James Jaspers until Jaspers turns into the Fury. Merlyn then comes to his daughter to finish the job only to be beaten by Psylocke. Cap then makes his move on the Fury and with the help of Blink and Albion vanquishes him for now, leading to Merlyn&#x27;s defeat. However, this victory comes with a price as Roma dies, though not before transferring her knowledge into Sage&#x27;s mind. Saturnyne then promises to free Albion from jail to lead the Corps while Sage and TJ switch teams with Longshot who now remembers the highlights of his past.

The events of &quot;Die by the Sword&quot; take place between Exiles #99-#100.

====&quot;Exiles&quot; #100====
In &quot;Exiles&quot; #100 Blink, Nocturne, and Thunderbird decide to leave the team because they are physically and emotionally exhausted and need a break. They leave for Heather Hudson&#x27;s reality so that Heather can keep track of Nocturne&#x27;s progress as she continues to recover from her stroke. Sage struggles with her new knowledge gained from Roma and accidentally fights the other Exiles. Cat and Rogue explore the palace and almost die in a bungee-jumping accident, prompting Rogue to reveal flying powers.

In the one-shot &quot;Exiles: Days of Then and Now&quot;, Blink discovers an Earth they were supposed to save, but did not because they were chasing Proteus during the World Tour. Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from that reality died because they did not receive help from the Exiles. So, Blink decides to help an alternate Quentin Quire by acting as the Timebroker through Gambit&#x27;s old Tallus, which is given to him by the Nighthawk from the reality where the Exiles had battled Weapon X after Quentin is able to transport himself there on his own. Then, he meets Mary Jane and Luke Cage, from the Vi-Locks reality, and an alternate Spitfire. Finally, he ends up in the Age of Apocalypse where he saves Wild Child. Blink then sends all five heroes (Luke Cage, Quentin, Nighthawk, Spitfire, and Wild Child) to replace Iron Man, Nighthawk, Wild Child, and Luke Cage from Quentin&#x27;s reality.

===New Exiles===

The team went to Earth-6706 to recruit Gambit and found themselves in a three-way war between Namor, Ororo, and the Black Panther. The team was separated with Rogue, Gambit and Namor, Mystiq in disguise with the Panther&#x27;s team, and Sabretooth and Psylocke with Ororo. They eventually reunited for a final fight against the Panther and would have died if not for Psylocke and the powers of Gambit&#x27;s mother, Susan Storm. Their mission was eventually revealed to them and they left the Earth despite the fact that the Panther had taken control of it. Meanwhile, Morph, Sage, and Cat are sucked into a world were Kitty shifts to another form. Sage regains her telepathic powers, as they defend a man who has fallen in love with a dragon.

After some fighting, the parents eventually surrender against true love and the dragon becomes human, while the Exiles are brought back to the Panoptichron, where Cat reveals that Gambit was listed as a member even before he was recruited. In the meantime, Hydra recruits a Wolverine-like man to her cause. Afterwards, Sage, Psylocke, Morph, Mystiq, Rogue, and Gambit help a team of X-Men on another Earth fight off the French during a French and British war. Psylocke receives some training from that world&#x27;s Ogun. Cat discovers realities upon realities coming to their end and finds she can do nothing to stop it. However, she and Sabretooth face off against Empress Hydra after she locks them alone in a particular reality. Cat kills Wolverine by removing his claws and slashing him with them. The Exiles then enjoy a quick break in the Panoptichron, where Morph gives Rogue a new costume and Psylocke deals with her fear of Slaymaster.

The Exiles then visit a reality where Valeria Richards has traveled and has called them for help to save the world from the Fearsome Quintet of Gold Goblin, Magneta, the Blood Skull, Black Baron Dormammu, and Doom. They defeat the quintet, but their leader, the Maker, is about to defeat them when Proteus&#x27; persona re-emerges. However, Morph&#x27;s persona merges with that of Proteus in the nick of time, stopping Proteus from killing the Exiles and saving the day. Valeria offers to assist them in fighting her mom, but Morph tells her that she would regret it and they suggest she go home. They then go to a reality where the main heroes are the human Daughters and Saurian Sons of the Dragon. There, they fight Lilandra, who has allied herself with Empress Hydra and they try to save Lilandra&#x27;s sister Neramani from her. During the fight, Cat merges with Mystiq and kills Empress Hydra, thanks to an unplanned diversion by Gambit, who called her &quot;mom&quot;. Meanwhile, Sage and Diana Fox are forced to unite to face off against Merlyn in Sage&#x27;s mind. Diana eventually lets Sage take her over and Sage merges with the Crystal Palace, stopping the multiverse from destabilizing. Cat dies after the battle with Madame Hydra. The other Exiles save Neramani&#x27;s world, with Rogue remaining behind since she has fallen in love with one of the Saurians.

Valeria Richards arrives at the Crystal Palace and joins the team, having been able to discern its location. Some time later, the New Exiles return to Gambit&#x27;s world, where he discovers his father has died and he takes over as king, leaving the Exiles. Sabertooth and Psylocke begin a relationship. They, Sage, Morph, Valeria Richards, and Mystiq are the New Exiles.

===Second Series===
The series was once again relaunched in April 2009, written by Jeff Parker and drawn by Salvador Espin, but canceled in September 2009. Alternate versions of The Witch, Beast, Forge, Polaris, and The Panther are picked up right before their intended deaths and put together as a team with the returning Blink, though she pretends to be new to all of this just as much as the others. Morph acts as the Timebroker and this version of the Black Panther is T&#x27;challa&#x27;s son, T&#x27;chaka. On their first mission, they are teleported away without finishing their mission, to Blink&#x27;s shock.

The team then goes to an Earth where Cerebro has killed all humans in North America. Working with the renegade Vision, Ultron, and Machine Man, the Exiles manage to disable Cerebro and give all the humans life model decoy bodies. After that mission, Morph tells the Exiles that they still have time to break up the X-Men/Brotherhood alliance from their first mission. They head back to that Earth and replace the native Scarlet Witch for their own. She reveals to Jean that Scott and Emma are having an affair, turning the telepaths against each other and dissolving the alliance. Emma Frost eventually kills the Witch from the Exiles&#x27; team, leaving the native Scarlet Witch to secretly join the Exiles.

The team then takes a vacation on a peaceful Earth. During this time, Polaris reveals she can tell Blink is lying, so Forge builds a device to send everyone to where the Tallus was transmitting from. Forge plants the device on the Tallus during the next teleport and Panther knocks Blink out. The Exiles then discover and head inside the Crystal Palace.

There, they see multiple teams of Exiles being trained by various &quot;Timebrokers&quot;. Blink finds them and decides to explain everything. She says she was going to wait until the team got the hang of saving broken realities, then fake her own death, at which point a new member was to replace her. The team is teleported to the main room, where they find Heather (no longer pregnant), Nocturne (recovered from her stroke), and Morph waiting.

The three of them reveal to the latest Exiles team that the last Exiles team, Sage, Sabretooth, Mystiq, Valeria, Rogue, and Gambit eventually became immersed within the Crystal Palace. Only Morph was spared, since he had Proteus possessing him, and the Crystal Palace absorbed Proteus in Morph&#x27;s place. Heather reveals that she came up with the idea of snatching the new recruits at the moment of death, as it seemed to be &quot;the least disruptive way to go&quot;.

Polaris, Forge, Beast, and Panther all look at how their homeworlds turned out after they died. They all decide to continue working as a team and are each given their own Tallus. Nocturne goes with them in Blink&#x27;s place for the next mission while Blink begins to train a new team.

====After the series&#x27; end====
*Psylocke was returned to Earth-616 via the Red Queen&#x27;s magic and was briefly brainwashed into fighting alongside her sisterhood against the X-Men before being freed by Dazzler. Psylocke has also been shown to lose her immunity to magic spells, telepathic attacks, and reality alterations, as she was later possessed by Earth-616 Proteus.
*Sabretooth was somehow liberated from Panoptichron&#x27;s stasis gallery and returned to the Age of Apocalypse. He later met up with Psylocke when she visited his reality and he and his X-Men helped her and X-Force steal a celestial artifact. After the two teams parted ways, most of his reality&#x27;s X-Men were killed. Only he and Jean Grey were spared, but depowered. They escaped into the hands of William Stryker&#x27;s &quot;X-Terminated,&quot; who arrested and imprisoned Sabretooth almost immediately. Sabretooth later sacrificed himself to save the rest of his team during the &quot;X-Termination&quot; event.
*Sage was also liberated from Panoptichron&#x27;s stasis gallery and served as SWORD&#x27;s ambassador on another world. She met up with her former New Excalibur teammate Dazzler, who was visiting that reality to rescue a teammate. Sage left her job with SWORD behind to join Dazzler&#x27;s team, who were hopping around realities throughout the multiverse and performing missions to save realities, much like the Exiles.
*Spider-Man 2099 and Mary Jane are still together when the attacks of Morlun during the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline are felt. Miguel learned about Morlun during his tenure with the Exiles, and senses Morlun is out there killing spiders. He gathers some of the Exiles&#x27; old equipment and prepares to flee to Earth-616, where Morlun was once killed. However, just as Miguel and Mary Jane are about to make the jump, Morlun arrives and kills that Miguel in front of the Miguel from the original timeline stranded in the present. Morlun disappears and the portal closes, leaving the Exiles&#x27; Miguel dead and the 616 Miguel desperate to find Peter Parker.

===Third Series===
The man once known as Nick Fury recruits champions from alternate universes when a mysterious threat casts its shadow on the multiverse. Blink would be joined by a Kamala Khan from a post-apocalyptic reality, Iron Lad, Wolvie and Valkyrie in her journey to save the multiverse. The team is later joined by Peggy Carter as the Captain America of her universe, and a reality-reincarnated female version of Bucky Barnes.

==Weapon X==
First seen in &quot;Exiles&quot; #5, they are a team that complete missions more ruthlessly than those of the Exiles. This team had various members and its roster changed more than the Exiles. Weapon X was originally composed of Sabretooth, Kane, Mesmero, Wolverine, Maverick, and Deadpool.

Weapon X was finally disbanded when the Exiles arrived and both Blink and Gambit received the mission: Weapon X and the Exiles were meant to fight to the death until only six remained. Magik, and Hulk were killed by Hyperion, while Firestar killed the Spider, immolating herself in the process. Ms. Marvel was killed in battle with Morph and finally, Hyperion was killed thanks to Gambit&#x27;s sacrifice. Instead of six survivors, there were only five: Blink, Mimic, Morph, Sasquatch and Nocturne.

The Exiles wouldn&#x27;t meet any member of Weapon X until their visit to the Panoptichron, in which they saw all former members of Exiles and Weapon X placed in stasis in one of the galleries of the Crystal Palace. After the Exiles contained the threat of Proteus they went about returning the bodies of the deceased to their native homeworlds, including all former Weapon X members, for proper burials.

==Other versions==
*In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #461, Mojo summons a team of lawyers modeled after the Exiles team to capture his recently created X-Babies. The team consisted of versions of Blink, Morph, Mimic, Sunfire, Sasquatch, and Nocturne.
*In the animated &quot;What If...?&quot;, the Watchers describe as &quot;Exiles&quot; another group of Multiverse-travelling heroes, better known as the Guardians of the Multiverse.

<text>The Summit Tunnel fire occurred on 20 December 1984, when a dangerous goods train caught fire while passing through the Summit Tunnel on the railway line between Littleborough and Todmorden on the Greater Manchester/West Yorkshire border, England.

==Background==

The tunnel, which is in length, was built in 1840–41. Twelve of the fourteen construction shafts were left open to help vent smoke and steam from the locomotives that passed through it.

The incident was one of a series of British railway accidents during 1984, coming only days after the fatal collision between an express passenger train and a train of fuel oil tankers at Eccles, Greater Manchester on 4 December. One day earlier on 3 December a train guard had been killed after a collision between a diesel multiple unit and parcels vans at Longsight also in Manchester. This third serious railway accident in the North West of England in less than three weeks led the Littleborough and Saddleworth MP Geoffrey Dickens to call for an inquiry into railway safety, in particular with respect to the conveyance of dangerous chemicals such as those involved in the accidents at Eccles and Summit Tunnel.

==Fire==
The train involved was the 01:40 freight train from Haverton Hill, Teesside to oil distribution terminal near Warrington. It was formed by class 47 diesel locomotive 47 125 and thirteen tankers.

At 05:50 on 20 December 1984, the train, carrying more than or of four-star petrol in thirteen tankers, entered the tunnel on the Yorkshire (north) side traveling at . One-third of the way through the tunnel, a defective axle bearing (journal bearing) derailed the fourth tanker, which caused the derailment of those behind. Only the locomotive and the first three tankers remained on the rails. One of the derailed tankers fell on its side and began to leak petrol into the tunnel. Vapour from the leaking petrol was probably ignited by the damaged axle box.

The three train crew members could see fire spreading through the ballast beneath the other track in the tunnel, so they left the train and ran the remaining mile to the south portal (where they knew there was a direct telephone connection to the signalman) to raise the alarm.

Crews from Greater Manchester Fire Brigade and West Yorkshire Fire Brigade quickly attended the scene. Co-ordination between the brigades appears to have worked well, perhaps because they had both participated in an emergency exercise in the tunnel a month before.

The train crew were persuaded to return to the train, where they uncoupled the three tankers still on the rails and used the locomotive to drive them out. Greater Manchester fire brigade then loaded firefighting equipment onto track trolleys and sent a crew with breathing apparatus (BA) in to begin their firefighting operation at the south end of the train. They also lowered hose lines down one of the ventilation shafts to provide a water supply. At the same time, crews from West Yorkshire fire brigade entered the tunnel and began fighting fires in the ballast at the north end of the train.

However, at 9.40 a.m., the pressure in one of the heated tankers rose high enough to open its pressure relief valves. The vented vapour caught fire and blew flames onto the tunnel wall. The wall deflected the flames both ways along the tunnel, and the bricks in the tunnel wall began to spall and melt in the flames. The BA crews from both brigades decided to evacuate. They managed to leave just before the first explosion rocked the tunnel. The firefighters were saved because blast relief shafts 8 and 9 acted as flame vents (a function their designer never envisaged).

Left to itself, the fire burned as hot as it could. As the walls warmed up and the air temperature in the tunnel rose, all 10 tankers discharged petrol vapour from their pressure relief valves. Two tankers melted (at approximately ) and discharged their remaining loads.

The fuel supply to the fire was so rich that some of the combustibles were unable to find oxygen inside the tunnel with which to burn; they were instead ejected from vent shafts 8 and 9 as fuel-rich gases that burst into flame when they encountered oxygen in the air outside. At the height of the fire, pillars of flame approximately high rose from the shaft outlets on the hillside above.

The gases are estimated to have flowed up these shafts at . Air at this speed is capable of blowing around heavy items: hot projectiles made from tunnel lining (rather like lava bombs from a volcano) were cast out over the hillside. These set much of the vegetation on fire, and caused the closure of the A6033 road. In the cleanup operation afterwards, small globules of metal were found on the ground surrounding shaft 9; these had been melted from the tanker walls, swept up with the exhaust gases, and dropped out onto the grass around the top of the shaft.

Unable to get close enough to safely fight the fire directly, the fire brigades forced high-expansion foam into ventilation shafts far from the fire. This created blockages that starved the fire of oxygen. By mid-afternoon the next day, the inferno was no longer burning, though the fire was by no means knocked down. Petrol continued to leak from the derailed wagons through the tunnel drainage and ballast and the vapour sporadically reignited when it came into contact with the hot tunnel lining. Two hundred people were evacuated from their homes and workplaces in Walsden in response. They were allowed back home the next day.

The brigades continued to fight the fire for another two days, until West Yorkshire Fire Brigade issued the stop message just after 6:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Fire crews remained at the site until 7 January 1985.

==Aftermath==

Due to the fire, the line between and was closed. Passenger trains between two stations were replaced by buses. Of the of petrol carried by the train, were rescued by the train crew when they drove the locomotive and the first three tankers to safety. A further of petrol were recovered after the fire was extinguished, and () burnt.

The damage done by the fire was minimal. Approximately half a mile of track had to be replaced, as did all the electrical services and signalling. The biggest surprise was how well the brick lining had stood up to the fire. Although some bricks in the tunnel and in the blast relief shafts had become so hot that they vitrified and ran like molten glass, most of the brickwork lining of the tunnel was scorched but still serviceable. One of the photographs taken in the aftermath shows a rail tanker directly beneath shaft 9: it is crowned with a mass of vitrified slag from bricks in the shaft that had melted and dripped down.

The last of the wagons was removed from the tunnel on 1 March 1985. Once British Rail had replaced the track and electrical services, shored up the bases of vent shafts 8 and 9 and filled the two shafts with inert foam (all this took eight months), locals were allowed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk through the tunnel before train services resumed on 19 August 1985.

At the Masons Arms public house in Todmorden, there is a small collection of photographs noting the fire, along with the statistics of the construction, and a quotation by George Stephenson, the tunnel&#x27;s builder, who said, &quot;I stake my reputation and my head that the tunnel will never fail so as to injure any human life&quot;.

==Investigation==
A public enquiry was held into the accident. The hearing was held in Manchester. A report was published on 4 June 1985.

<doc id="845595" wikidata="Q2776593" url="?curid=845595" title="Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?">
<text>&quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written by lyricist Yip Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, it was part of the 1932 musical revue &quot;Americana&quot;; the melody is based on a Russian-Jewish lullaby. The song tells the story of the universal everyman, whose honest work towards achieving the American dream has been foiled by the economic collapse. Unusual for a Broadway song, it was composed largely in a minor key. The song became best known through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallée that were released in late 1932. The song received positive reviews and was one of the most popular songs of 1932. As one of the few popular songs during the era to discuss the darker aspects of the collapse, it came to be viewed as an anthem of the Great Depression.

==Background==
The Great Depression in the United States, which started with the 1929 Wall Street crash, had a severe impact on the country. In 1932, 25 percent of American men were unemployed.

After his appliance business went bankrupt, Yip Harburg had gone into the music business, working as a lyricist. The melody derives from a Jewish lullaby that the composer Jay Gorney, who emigrated to the United States in 1906, heard in his native Russia. Initially, it had other lyrics which discussed a romantic breakup. Gorney recalled that the pair came up with the title &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; after walking in the Central Park where they heard unemployed men asking &quot;Can you spare a dime?&quot; Harburg recalled that he was working on a song for the musical &quot;Americana&quot;: &quot;We had to have a title... Not to say, my wife is sick, I&#x27;ve got six children, the Crash put me out of business, hand me a dime. I hate songs of that kind.&quot; Harburg&#x27;s worksheets show that he went through several drafts of the lyrics, which included a satirical version attacking John D. Rockefeller and other tycoons. However, over time Harburg moved towards more concrete imagery, resulting in the final version. Both Gorney and Harburg were socialists.

==Composition and lyrical interpretation==
The song is about a man who has sought the American dream, but was foiled by the Great Depression. He is the universal everyman who holds various professions, being a farmer and a construction worker as well as a veteran of World War I: it is intended to embrace all listeners. The man is someone &quot;who kept faith in America, and now America has betrayed him&quot;. After three years of the Depression, the man has lost his job and is reduced to begging for charity. He recognizes the man whose dime () he is asking for. The lyrics refer to &quot;Yankee Doodle Dum&quot;, a reference to patriotism, and the evocation of veterans also recalls the mid-1932 Bonus Army protests about military bonuses payable only after 21 years. Harburg said in an interview: &quot;the man is really saying: I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends? ... [The song] doesn&#x27;t reduce him to a beggar. It makes him a dignified human being, asking questions—and a bit outraged, too, as he should be.&quot; This reflects the socialist or Marxist idea that workers deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor, rather than have it be diverted by others.

&quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; has an unusual structure for a Broadway song. First, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past, the melody jumps an octave on the words &quot;building a dream&quot;, emphasizing the dream, and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. This is placed in baffling and poignant contrast with the reality (&quot;standing in line, / Just waiting for bread&quot;). The song then reverts to the augmented dominant of the minor key in the word &quot;time&quot; in the line &quot;Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,&quot; marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. Each of the three main stanzas end in a direct appeal to the listener, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; The bridge deals with the singer&#x27;s experiences as a veteran of the Great War, falling from patriotism &quot;looked swell&quot; to the discordant harmonies of &quot;slogging through hell&quot;. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly &quot;&quot;Brother,&quot; can you spare a dime?&quot; is replaced with the more assertive &quot;&quot;Buddy,&quot; can you spare a dime?&quot; According to Harold Meyerson and Ernest Harburg, &quot;[r]hythmically and melodically it sounds like a Jewish chant.&quot; An article in &quot;Tablet&quot; magazine suggested that the melody was similar to Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem.

==Musical and cover versions==
The song was first performed by the vaudeville singer Rex Weber as part of the musical &quot;Americana&quot;, which ran from October to December 1932 and was not a success. Three weeks after &quot;Americana&quot; opened, the song was covered by crooner Bing Crosby for Brunswick Records; it was also covered by Rudy Vallee shortly thereafter for Columbia Records. Unusually, Vallee&#x27;s version includes a spoken introduction, in which the narrator states that the song is &quot;a bit out of character&quot; for him. The song became popular through these versions, which were both frequently aired on the radio and competed for listeners. By the end of the year, Al Jolson had also covered the song on his popular show for NBC. The song has been covered by at least 52 artists in the United States including Judy Collins and Tom Waits.

In the UK, it was recorded by Harry Roy and his Orchestra (From the Cafe Anglais, London) in 1933 and issued by Parlophone, with vocals by Bill Currie, featuring non-vocal speech by Currie and Roy. A version by Lew Stone and his Band (again at the Cafe Anglais) was recorded the same year for a &quot;Lew Stone Favourites&quot; medley, with vocals by Al Bowlly, and released by Decca. In 1948, a revival of the song by British vocalist Steve Conway was released on Columbia.

During the 1970s stagflation and in light of the Watergate scandal, Harburg wrote a parody version for &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
==Reception and legacy==
At the time, reviews of musicals rarely devoted much space to the songs&#x27; lyrics and melody. That was not true of the reviews of &quot;Americana&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson wrote that &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; was &quot;plaintive and thundering&quot; and &quot;the first song of the year that can be sung... Mr. Gorney has expressed the spirit of these times with more heart-breaking anguish than any of the prose bards of the day.&quot; Gilbert Gabriel in &quot;New York American&quot; wrote: &quot;Gorney and Harburg have written something so stirring that it will run away with the whole show&quot;. &quot;Theater Arts Monthly&quot;″s review stated that the song &quot;deflates the rolling bombast of our political nightmare with greater effect than all the rest of Mr. McEvoy&#x27;s satirical skits put together&quot;; &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;Brother&quot; was the only part of the show worth praising. Harburg later wrote that the song earned him several thousand dollars and helped him get started in the music business. Business leaders tried to have it banned from the radio, viewing the song as &quot;a dangerous attack on the American economic system&quot;. They were unsuccessful, due to the song&#x27;s popularity. William Zinsser writes that &quot;[t]he song so lacerated the national conscience that radio stations banned it&quot; for being &quot;sympathetic to the unemployed&quot;.

Few thematic Depression songs were popular, because Americans did not want music which reminded them of the economic situation, but &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot; was &quot;the exception that proved the rule&quot;. Unlike other popular songs of the same era which tended to be upbeat, with titles such as &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; (1929), &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (1930), and &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries&quot; (1931), &quot;Brother&quot; &quot;put words and music to what many Americans were feeling—fear, grief, even anger&quot;. The song was one of the first musical works to take the Depression seriously. It was one of the most popular twenty songs of 1932 in the United States. Philip Furia and Michael Lasser wrote that the song &quot;embodied the Depression for millions of Americans... No other popular song caught the spirit of its time with such urgency.&quot; In 2007, Clyde Haberman wrote that the song &quot;endures as an anthem for the downtrodden and the forgotten&quot;. In 2011, Zinsser wrote that &quot;Brother&quot; &quot;still hovers in the national memory; I can hear its ghostly echo in the chants of the Occupy Wall Street marchers&quot;. In a 2008 retrospective, NPR described it as &quot;the anthem of the Great Depression&quot;.

According to Meyerson and Ernest Harburg, the challenge that Yip Harburg faced in crafting the lyrics was &quot;much like the challenge confronting the street-corner panhandler: to establish the character&#x27;s individuality and the moral and political basis for his claim&quot;. They write that the latter achieved this by gradually building intimacy with the listener, starting in third person and moving into first, second, and then both first and second combined (&quot;I&#x27;m your pal&quot;). The internal rhymes help the listener remember that the singer was working towards a dream, which is now shattered. They also write that the song is a &quot;masterpiece of economy&quot; in building towards a &quot;climactic assertion of commonality and interdependency&quot; in &quot;I&#x27;m your pal&quot;. &quot;The music and lyrics together make us feel the quiet desperation of the singer.&quot;

Pianist Rob Kapilow remarked that the title is &quot;the entire history of the Depression in a single phrase&quot; and the listener ends up &quot;feeling the time-immemorial complaint that the working man doesn&#x27;t get the rewards&quot;. He says that Harburg and Gorney were brave to express this message in 1932 &quot;when no one was saying this out loud&quot;. Furia and Lasser write that the song is unusual in relying on a strong narrative instead of emotion or imagery. Thomas S. Hischak wrote that the song was &quot;one of the first theatre songs to have a potent sociological message, and it remains one of the most powerful of the genre&quot;. The song was the most prominent cultural representation of the Bonus Army.

<doc id="845597" wikidata="Q1450384" url="?curid=845597" title="Italian Radicals">
<text>The Italian Radicals (, RI) are a liberal and libertarian political party in Italy. The party draws inspiration form 19th-century classical radicalism and the Radical Party. The RI are a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and were previously a member of the Liberal International.

Established on 14 July 2001 with Daniele Capezzone as its first secretary, the party describes itself as &quot;&quot;liberale&quot;, &quot;liberista&quot; [and] &quot;libertario&quot;&quot;, where &quot;liberale&quot; refers to political liberalism, &quot;liberista&quot; is an Italian term for economic liberalism, and &quot;libertario&quot; denotes a form of cultural liberalism concerning moral and social issues.

From 2001 to 2017, the party intended to be the Italian section of the Transnational Radical Party (TRP) as the continuation of the Radical Party founded in 1955 by the left wing of the Italian Liberal Party and re-launched in the 1960s by Marco Pannella. As the Radical Party had become a transnational non-governmental organization working mainly at the United Nations level, which by statute could not participate in national elections, its Italian members organised themselves into the Pannella List between 1992 and 1999 and the Bonino List until 2001, when they established the RI. In 2017, the TRP broke with the RI. From 2017 to 2022 and again since 2024 the RI have been associated with More Europe (+E), a broader liberal party led by Radicals or former Radicals. &quot;Quaderni Radicali&quot; and &quot;Notizie Radicali&quot; are the party&#x27;s newspapers. Radio Radicale is the official radio station of the party; in December 2008, it was awarded by &quot;Italia Oggi&quot; as the &quot;best specialized radio broadcaster&quot;.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The Radical Party was long a left-libertarian movement in Italy, often proposing itself as the most extreme opposition to the Italian political establishment. When Silvio Berlusconi entered the political arena in 1994, the Radicals, who were then organised mostly into the Pannella List and were attracted by Berlusconi&#x27;s proposed economic liberalism, supported him, albeit critically and without becoming directly involved in his centre-right first government (1994–1995), in the hope of a &quot;liberal revolution&quot; as opposed to the conservative and statist political establishment represented by traditional parties.

The relationship between the Radicals and Berlusconi, whose allies included socially conservative groups at odds with the Radicals&#x27; cultural liberalism, soon ended. In the 1999 European Parliament election, the Bonino List obtained 8.7% of the vote and seven MEPs, including Emma Bonino, Marco Pannella, Marco Cappato and Benedetto Della Vedova. However, the Radicals were not able to convert that electoral success into a more stable political influence, as subsequent elections would show.

=== Road to the new party ===
Shortly after the 1999 election, they deserted Berlusconi&#x27;s proposal of welcoming them back into the centre-right fold and instead formed the Committee of Radicals for the Liberal Revolution and the United States of Europe, led by Cappato. In the run-up of the 2000 regional elections, the opposite happened: Berlusconi&#x27;s conservative allies posed a veto on the Radicals, who wanted to re-compose the alliance. Consequently, they ran independent bids in most regions, obtaining elects only in Piedmont and Lombardy.

In 2001, after a defeat in the general election (only 2.3% of the vote and no seats), they re-organised themselves as Italian Radicals and elected 28-year-old Daniele Capezzone as secretary and Della Vedova, Rita Bernardini and Luca Coscioni as joint presidents.

In the run-up of the 2005 regional elections, the Radicals understood that their isolation was no longer sustainable and took the unprecedented step of contextually asking to join either the centre-right House of Freedoms or the centre-left The Union, regardless of their respective political platforms. The request was turned down by both coalitions, but the effort opened the way for the party&#x27;s re-positionment in the Italian party system.

=== Rose in the Fist ===

In November 2005, the Radicals formed an alliance with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI), becoming &quot;de facto&quot; members of The Union coalition for the 2006 general election. The &quot;rose in the fist&quot;, the symbol of the Socialist International (which included the SDI) which the Radical Party bought from the French Socialist Party, was chosen for the joint list that was thus named Rose in the Fist (RnP). This decision led those Radicals who were more keen on an alliance with the centre-right to split: this group, led by Della Vedova, launched the Liberal Reformers and joined the House of Freedoms, eventually merging into Berlusconi&#x27;s Forza Italia.

In the election, the list won a mere 2.6% of the vote, much less than the combined support for the two parties before the alliance (the Radicals alone got 2.3% in the 2004 European Parliament election). The Radicals lost voters in their strongholds in the North to Forza Italia, while the Socialists lost ground in their southern heartlands to The Olive Tree parties (see electoral results of the RnP). After the election, Bonino was sworn in as Minister of European Affairs and International Trade in the Prodi II Cabinet.

In November 2006, after a row with Pannella, Capezzone was forced not to run again for secretary and was replaced by rank-and-file Bernardini. Since then, although not officially leaving, Capezzone became very critical of the government and formed his own political association named Decide!, closer to the centre-right than the centre-left. Later on, Capezzone entered Forza Italia and became the party&#x27;s spokesman.

In November 2007, the RnP was disbanded as the SDI merged with minor Socialist parties to form the modern-day Italian Socialist Party. The Radicals were at a new turning-point of their history. In the run-up of the 2007 congress, Pannella declared that the party should &quot;give absolute priority to economic, liberal and libertarian reforms rather than the civil struggle to Vatican power, prepotency and arrogance&quot;, which had been central in 2006. This did not mean a reconciliation with the centre-right.

=== Within the Democratic Party ===
In the 2008 general election, the Radicals stood for re-election in list with the Democratic Party (PD). Under an agreement with PD&#x27;s leader Walter Veltroni, six deputies and three senators were elected. After the election, Bonino was appointed Vice President of the Senate and the Radicals joined the PD&#x27;s parliamentary groups. In June, Bernardini, Maria Antonietta Coscioni and Elisabetta Zamparutti (all three elected MPs) were replaced by Antonella Casu, Bruno Mellano and Michele De Lucia as secretary, president and treasurer, respectively. In November, the new leadership was confirmed by the national congress.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the Radicals ran separately from the PD under the banner of Bonino-Pannella List. Having obtained 2.4% of the vote, they failed to return any MEPs and were excluded from the assembly for the first time in 30 years. In November, Mario Staderini replaced Casu as secretary.

Bonino ran for President of Lazio for the centre-left coalition in the 2010 regional election, but was defeated by Renata Polverini.

=== Out of Parliament ===

In January 2013, the party announced that it would contest the upcoming general election on a stand-alone electoral list called Amnesty, Justice and Freedom (&quot;Aministia, Giustizia, e Libertà&quot;). In the election, the party received 0.2% of the vote, returning no deputies and senators. However, in April and after two months of failed attempts at forming a new government, thanks to her international standing and Pannella&#x27;s lobbying efforts, Bonino was sworn in as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Letta Cabinet. The cabinet lasted until 22 February 2014, when it was replaced by the Renzi Cabinet, which did not include Bonino.

In November 2013, the party elected a new leadership: Bernardini secretary, Laura Arconti president and Valerio Federico treasurer. The party did not take part in the 2014 European Parliament election, partly due to lack of funds.

During the annual party congress in November 2015, Riccardo Magi was elected secretary and Cappato president. Pannella, who did not speak at the congress, opposed the change, while Bonino, who was no longer in good terms with the old leader, did not even take part in the congress. However, in the following months Bonino decided to side with Magi and Cappato, who launched &quot;Radical&quot; lists for the 2016 municipal elections in Rome and Milan, in a move opposed by the leadership of the TRP, especially Maurizio Turco. The lists obtained 1.2% and 1.9%, respectively, and in both cases they supported the candidates put forward by the PD, either in the first or the second round, opening the way for the party&#x27;s rapprochement with the centre-left at country-level.

=== Pannella&#x27;s death and split ===
In May 2016, Pannella, who had long suffered from cancer, died and Italian politicians from across the entire political spectrum paid tribute to him.

In the event, the party found itself increasingly divided in two factions: on one side Magi, Cappato and Staderini (who were backed by Bonino), on the other Turco, Bernardini and most of the staff of Radio Radicale (who were closer to the late Pannella). The former focused more on Italian politics and elections, while the latter were more interested in the activity of the Transnational Radical Party (TRP) and no longer in playing an active role in elections (as suggested by Pannella).

The fracture was evident in September 2016 at the congress of the TRP, during which the faction of Turco and Bernardini soundly beat the other wing. At the November 2016 congress, in turn the RI confirmed Magi as secretary, while electing Antonella Soldo as president.

In February 2017, the TRP severed its ties with the RI (who were accused of boycotting the TRP) and the latter were forced out of the Radical headquarters.

=== Return to Parliament ===
In November 2017, the RI formed, along with Della Vedova&#x27;s Forza Europa (FE) and some members of the Civics and Innovators (CI), More Europe (+E), a pro-Europeanist list for the 2018 general election, led by Bonino. +E was part of the centre-left coalition led by Matteo Renzi and the PD.

The list won 2.6% of the vote in the election, falling short of the 3% threshold, but Bonino was elected to the Senate in a single-seat constituency in Rome, Magi to the Chamber also from Rome and Alessandro Fusacchia from the European constituency of Italians abroad. Contextually, the list obtained 2.1% and one regional councillor in the Lombard regional election and 2.1% and one regional councillor also in the 2018 regional election.

In July 2018, +E started to organise itself as a full-fledged party. It was decided that a committee, presided by Gianfranco Spadaccia (a long-time Radical), would lead +E until the founding congress, scheduled for January 2019. The newly formed committee appointed Della Vedova as coordinator. In November, following his election to Parliament, Magi was replaced by Silvja Manzi as secretary; at the same congress Barbara Bonvicini was elected president and Antonella Soldo treasurer. One year later, Manzi, Bonvicini and Soldo were respectively replaced by Massimiliano Iervolino, Igor Boni and Giulia Crivellini.

In August 2019, tensions grew within the coalition supporting the Conte government, leading to the issuing of a motion of no-confidence by the League. During the following government crisis, the M5S and the PD agreed to form a new cabinet together, under outgoing Prime Minister Conte. In September, +E decided not to support the newly formed Conte II Cabinet, despite opposition by Tabacci, Magi and Fusacchia. The three voted in favour of the government in the Chamber, while Bonino voted against it in the Senate. In October, Fusacchia announced he was leaving +E.

In November 2020, Magi and Bonino formed joint sub-groups in the Mixed Groups of the Chamber and the Senate respectively, together with the deputies and senators affiliated with Action, a political party led by Carlo Calenda. The sub-group in the Chamber continued to include &quot;Italian Radicals&quot; in its name.

===Recent events===
The party supported the centre-left coalition in the 2022 general election, with no candidates and elects.

The 2023 annual party congress was due in December, but was suspended due to irregularities. The congress was thus rescheduled in January 2024: internal elections were deserted by the party&#x27;s old guard and, as a result, 20-year-old Matteo Hallissey was elected secretary, 25-year-old Patrizia De Grazia president and 23-year-old Filippo Blengino treasurer.

In March 2024, in the run-up of the 2024 European Parliament election, the party was a founding member of a broad, liberal and pro-Europeanist list named &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, along with More Europe, Italia Viva, the Italian Socialist Party and the European Liberal Democrats, in order to overcome the 4% electoral threshold. In late April the list was joined also by L&#x27;Italia c&#x27;è.

In December 2024, during the party&#x27;s annual congress, Filippo Blengino was elected secretary and Hallissey president. In February 2025, the latter presented a list at More Europe&#x27;s fourth congress, obtaining around 11% of delegates, and was finally elected president with 69.5% of the vote, by defeating former More Europe secretary and former Italian Radicals president Della Vedova, who obtained 30.5%.

== Ideology ==
According to the party statute, the RI is both a &quot;liberal, liberist and libertarian&quot; party, and a non-ideological, pragmatic, and open movement. The party is the only Italian political movement that consents to dual membership with other parties. The Italian Radicals has been described as representing &quot;the most significant expression&quot; of &quot;libertarianism ... in the Italian context&quot;. &quot;Libertarianism&quot; in this sense is defined as follows: &quot;In emphasising the importance of individual liberty and personal responsibility with respects to all matters, libertarians argued that the only thing that may legtimately be demanded of others is non-interference. Hence, libertarians oppose state intervention to help individuals achieve self-realization (e.g., through welfare measures) or to protect them from themselves (e.g., through legislation against the sale and use of drugs). And on the same grounds they staunchly support private property and unregulated markets.&quot; According to Tom Lansford, the party is a mostly libertarian, middle-class political grouping standing for civil and human rights.

The RI claims the legacy of Risorgimento radical-republican figures such as Carlo Cattaneo, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Felice Cavallotti, and 19th-century liberal and socialist intellectuals as Gaetano Salvemini, the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, Benedetto Croce, and party ideologue Ernesto Rossi. Internationally, the RI political though is influenced by ideas of Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Immanuel Kant and Karl Popper.

The Radicals have long adopted referendums to bring political changes. Since 1974, the Radical Party and its successor RI had purposed more than 110 referendums and were successful 35 times. Other political methods have included Gandhi-inspired nonviolence, the Satyagraha, also adopting extreme tactics like hunger strike and, occasionally, thirst strike. Pannella became involved in nonviolence after a long-time association with Aldo Capitini, a pacifist activist nicknamed the &quot;Italian Gandhi&quot;.

On fiscal issues, the RI is usually liberal, supporting non-interventionist and free-market policies, but in recent times accepted part of the welfare state system, especially on healthcare. The RI is divided in two wings, i.e., the Friedmanians, who are influenced by Milton Friedman and the Chicago School, and the Keynesians, who support neo-Keynesian or post-Keynesian economics. This divide declined in the 2010s, when it adopted moderate liberal trends on economy.

On social issues, the RI appears as the most progressive party in Italy. The RI fully supports progressive stances including same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption, abortion, artificial insemination and euthanasia, vocally advocating for an advance healthcare directive (AHD). On healthcare, the RI support universal healthcare with possibility to choose between state-managed service and private insurances. The RI also calls for the legalization of prostitution and cannabis while enforcing the fight against hard drugs like heroin with harm reduction methods. On immigration, the RI supports ius soli policy and faster legal integration of regular immigrants, granting them citizenship and the right to vote. The RI criticises sentiment against illegal immigrants, rejecting the &quot;invasion&quot; theory supported by far-rightists. On religious affairs, the RI follows the historical Radical Party&#x27;s position of anti-clericalism, calling for the abolition of Lateran Treaty (approved in 1929 and modified in 1984) and secularisation. The party is a strong critic of the Catholic-dominated politics, underlining the ghettoisation of religious minorities, including atheists and agnostics.

On foreign affairs issues, the RI has been a keen supporter of European federalism, non-interventionism, Atlanticism and Zionism, while advocating a two-state solution. The party is also a strong supporter of enlargement of the European Union including towards Turkey, Morocco, Israel and Palestine and is a strong opponent of dictatorial-like states such as China, Russia and Syria. Despite their non-interventionism, the RI is not pacifist and supports war actions where civil rights are absent and minorities endangered, e.g., the Kosovo and Afghanistan wars. The RI had supported several cultural and social mobilisations in support of several persecuted ethnic and religious minorities including the Tibetans, the Uyghurs, the Degar and the Chechens.

<text>Wonder Boys is a 1995 novel by the American writer Michael Chabon. It was adapted into a film with the same title in 2000.

==Plot summary==
Pittsburgh professor and author Grady Tripp is working on an unwieldy 2,611-page manuscript that is meant to be the follow-up to his successful, award-winning novel &quot;The Land Downstairs&quot;, which was published seven years earlier. On the eve of a college-sponsored writers&#x27; and publishers&#x27; weekend called WordFest, Tripp&#x27;s wife walks out on him, and he learns that his mistress, the chancellor of the college, Sara Gaskell, is pregnant with his child. To top it all off, Tripp finds himself involved in a bizarre crime committed by one of his students, an alienated young writer named James Leer. During a party, Leer shoots and kills the chancellor’s dog and steals her husband’s prized Marilyn Monroe collectible: the jacket worn by the actress on the day of her marriage to Joe DiMaggio.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the novel as &quot;...the ultimate writing-program novel. If that sounds insulting, I don&#x27;t mean it to be. But anyone who has ever served time in a writing program and gone to the &quot;writing festivals&quot; at various universities will instantly recognize the milieu and the characters.&quot;

==Inspiration==
The novel grew from Chabon’s concerns with completing an unrealized novel, &quot;Fountain City&quot;, about the construction of a perfect baseball park in Florida. He decided to write a story about, in part, an author who couldn’t finish his own work. The main character of Grady Tripp is admittedly based on University of Pittsburgh professor, Chuck Kinder, who taught the undergraduate Chabon in the early 1980s. Kinder’s great opus, a novel inspired by his friendship with author Raymond Carver, was reportedly more than 3000 pages long at one point. It was finally published in a very slimmed-down version in 2001 as &quot;Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale&quot;.

<text>Kirsten Fifi Imrie (born 26 October 1967) is a former Page 3 girl, glamour model, and television presenter.

==Career==
Imrie was born on 21 April 1969 in Glasgow, Scotland, and raised in Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland from the age of three. After leaving school at the age of 16, she worked in various blue-collar jobs in the Edinburgh area. Aged 18, she married a local man from Haddington, East Lothian, but the marriage soon dissolved.

Imrie then moved to London and began a glamour modelling career. She started appearing as a Page 3 girl in &quot;The Sun&quot; in November 1988, shortly after her 21st birthday, and continued to appear regularly on Page 3 until August 1993. She also posed nude for a wide range of men&#x27;s magazines, including the US edition of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, which featured her as its cover girl and &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet for December 1989 (modelling under the pseudonym Kirsten Stewart). She continued to pose for glamour photographs through her late 30s, appearing in the April 2007 edition of &quot;Mayfair&quot; magazine at the age of 39.

Imrie also worked as a television presenter. In 1995, she appeared on the newly launched adult television channel Television X. In 1996, L!VE TV recruited Imrie as a television sports presenter. She replaced another former Page 3 girl, Gail McKenna, who had moved to the channel Five.

==Controversy and personal struggles==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, British tabloid newspapers regularly featured stories about Imrie&#x27;s jet-setting lifestyle, her alleged alcohol and cocaine abuse, her celebrity relationships, and even her alleged lesbian affairs with other glamour models.

In the 1990s, Imrie struggled with debt. On 27 September 1994, when she appeared in a London court on charges of driving under the influence (DUI), her solicitor told the court that she was no longer receiving regular modelling work, was struggling under a &quot;mountain of debt,&quot; was living on unemployment benefits, and was &quot;almost on the breadline&quot;.

In November 2000, tabloid newspapers ran stories reporting that Imrie was penniless and sleeping rough on Clapham Common, having sold her house to pay off debts. The tabloids later claimed that readers&#x27; donations had enabled Imrie to rent a flat in South London, resume her modelling career, and turn her life around.

In 2003, Imrie spoke about her homelessness and addiction problems in the UK television documentary &quot;The Curse of Page 3&quot;.

<doc id="845609" wikidata="Q435330" url="?curid=845609" title="Kristin Hersh">
<text>Martha Kristin Hersh (born August 7, 1966) is an American singer, guitarist, and songwriter known for her solo work and with her rock bands Throwing Muses and 50FootWave. She has released eleven solo albums. Her guitar work and composition style ranges from jaggedly dissonant to traditional folk. Hersh&#x27;s lyrics have a stream-of-consciousness style, reflecting her personal experiences.

==Early life==
Hersh was born in Atlanta. She moved to Newport, Rhode Island with her family, when she was six years old. Her father was a professor at Salve Regina University in and her mother a special educational needs teacher. Kristin was interested in music at an early age and wanted to learn guitar chords; her father gave her a guitar when she was nine. Kristin&#x27;s parents separated when Hersh was 11, and her mother married the father of her best friend Tanya Donelly. Hersh talked Donelly into starting a band, then called The Muses, when they were 14.

==Musical career==
===Throwing Muses and early solo work===

Throwing Muses was formed in 1981 when Hersh and Donelly were freshmen in high school. Friends from school, including Elaine Adamedes, Becca Blumen, Leslie Langston and David Narcizo, were part of the group with Narcizo (and in the beginning, Langston) becoming a long-term member. Hersh initially wrote and sang most of Throwing Muses&#x27; songs, often in changing tempos. Donelly contributed songs and lead vocals.

Hersh attended Salve Regina University in Newport, majoring in archetypal psychology and philosophy, but dropped out shortly before graduating to establish the band in Boston where they had been playing on weekends. While at Salve Regina, Hersh befriended film actress Betty Hutton, who was attending the school in her 60s; Hutton also attended several early Throwing Muses shows in Newport. The Throwing Muses were signed to 4AD, the first American group to be signed on the British label, and released the EP &quot;Chains Changed&quot; in 1987. Two releases followed, the mini-LP &quot;The Fat Skier&quot; and the album &quot;House Tornado&quot;. The 4AD Throwing Muses biography describes its sound at the time as &quot;joining the dots between elliptical post-punk, harmonious folk jangle and rockabilly thunder without ever settling into standard genre patterns.&quot; For the Throwing Muses 1986 UK tour, the Boston-based Pixies, embarking on their first European tour, was the opening band.

The band signed a U.S. deal with Sire/Reprise Records in 1987 and began touring the U.S. and Europe while recording albums, with Hersh writing most of the songs. The band became a trio when Donelly left the group after 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Real Ramona&quot;. In 1994, Hersh began a solo career on Sire/Reprise and 4AD as an acoustic performer, beginning with &quot;Hips and Makers&quot;, an album sparsely arranged around her vocals, guitar, and a cellist, in contrast to the volatile, electric sound of her band work. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. made an appearance on this first solo album. After receiving some airplay and major media coverage for the Throwing Muses album &quot;University&quot; in 1995, Hersh moved to Rykodisc for the band&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Limbo&quot;, and released her solo album, &quot;Strange Angels&quot;, in 1998.
To better control her career and the distribution of her recorded material, she created the ThrowingMusic label with then-husband and manager Billy O&#x27;Connell in 1996. That enabled her to co-release some of her projects, including an ongoing download-subscription service called Works in Progress (WIP) for releases available through the label&#x27;s website. Hersh continued to offer her solo releases online, releasing &quot;Sky Motel&quot; in 1999. Throwing Muses functions as a noncommercial musical enterprise, focusing on touring over record sales and airplay. In a 2014 interview, Hersh said, &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, music is not a commodity. It&#x27;s something that people have earned by being human. They have a right to hear it, and a right to share it, as they always have in churches and parties. That&#x27;s how music happens.&quot;

===2000 to present===

In 2001, Hersh released the &quot;Sunny Border Blue&quot; solo album, on which she again played nearly all instruments. She described the album as having even more intensity than her previous works, as she continued her pursuit of songwriting as being in part a way to transform &quot;ugly feelings&quot; into art. She also collaborated further with like-minded alternative artists like Vic Chesnutt, Willard Grant Conspiracy, Grant-Lee Phillips, and John Doe. In 2003, she released &quot;The Grotto&quot;, an acoustic solo album of song sketches with personal lyrics set in Providence, Rhode Island, with Andrew Bird on violin and Howe Gelb on piano. On the same date a self-titled album by Throwing Muses was also released, the first since &quot;Limbo&quot;. Both were recorded at Steve Rizzo&#x27;s studio in Rhode Island. When Narcizo was unable to tour on a full-time basis due to other commitments, Hersh formed her power rock trio 50FootWave. Her touring appearances and recording efforts in 2004 and 2005 centered around both 50 Foot Wave and her solo career.

====Independent output====
In 2007, Hersh released her first solo album in four years, entitled &quot;Learn to Sing Like a Star&quot;. NPR described Hersh&#x27;s &quot;emotional and raw&quot; pop songs as both &quot;accessible and off-kilter.&quot; Concurrently she launched CASH Music, a subscription-based, direct-to-consumer website, that was formed along with fellow musician Donita Sparks. Fans can become &quot;Strange Angels&quot; and subscribe to her output to receive albums and print releases, downloadable content, and guest spots for live shows–packages ranging from $30 per quarter to $5,000 (executive producer credit on her next album) 50FootWave&#x27;s EP &quot;Power+Light&quot; was released on CASH in 2009 and Hersh was involved in several projects—a second collection of Appalachian folksongs, &quot;The Shady Circle&quot; and a series of new free tracks. The album &quot;Crooked&quot; was released as a downloadable album and hardback book containing essays about each track.

Throwing Muses reformed in 2013 and released &quot;Purgatory/Paradise&quot;, a 32-track album accompanied by a book designed by Narcizo, who works as a graphic designer. The book features photos, artwork and lyrics by Hersh. It was the band&#x27;s first release in ten years.

At that point in her career, Hersh&#x27;s output was independently released online. She expressed that she wanted a complete break with the music industry, stating, &quot;Because we differ from the recording industry ethically, we had been asked to dumb down our product so many times. I have been asked to act and look like a bimbo so many times and I just decided, &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to turn my back on my music. I&#x27;m not going to turn my back on women.&#x27; We&#x27;re morally bound to not participate in the traditional recording industry because we disagree with it. So we continue to play music, which has nothing to do with the music business.&quot; In October 2016, she released the double album &quot;Wyatt at the Coyote Place&quot; and an accompanying book&quot;.&quot; Hersh embarked on a tour in support of the album. On June 12, 2018, Hersh announced on her website that she has signed with Fire Records. Her new record, &quot;Possible Dust Clouds&quot;, was released on October 5, 2018. She finished recording the album in May of the same year. In February 2020, it was announced that Throwing Muses would release a new album, &quot;Sun Racket&quot;, on May 22; the release was delayed to September 4.

==Themes and style==

Hersh&#x27;s vocal style ranges from softly melodic to impassioned screaming. She has an occasional vibrato that punctuates some of her more dramatic phrasing. Candid about her episodes of mental illness and despair, her songs cover a vast spectrum of topics, including childbirth (&quot;Hysterical Bending&quot;), love (&quot;Tar Kissers&quot;, &quot;Lavender&quot;), surreal vignettes (&quot;Delicate Cutters&quot;, &quot;Fish&quot;), death (&quot;Limbo&quot;), emotional anguish (&quot;The Letter&quot;), loss of custody of her first son (&quot;Candyland&quot;), and the shedding of a relationship&#x27;s anxiety (&quot;Snake Oil&quot;).

Simon Reynolds in &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed to Hersh&#x27;s &quot;mesmerizing&quot; explorations of &quot;rage, aggression and mental chaos&quot; as evidence of female rock artists of the early 1990s pushing against gender role boundaries to express &quot;more than simply vulnerability or defiance&quot; in their work. Ann Powers, also in the &quot;Times&quot;, wrote of Hersh&#x27;s musical style: &quot;Her plastic, sometimes obsessively circular song structures emphasize staggered rhythms and extreme dynamic shifts, and her voice, a carnal cry that pushes through her body gathering up air, lends her often oblique lyrics an oracular veneer.&quot;

===Influences===
Hersh has said her parents&#x27; album collections featuring Patti Smith, the Carter Family, Stevie Wonder, Robert Johnson, Talking Heads, The Clash, Steve Miller, The Beatles, Philip Glass, and traditional music influenced her when she was growing up. Among her early contemporary musical influences are The Raincoats, The Pretenders, Talking Heads, Violent Femmes, Meat Puppets, Dead Kennedys, Hüsker Dü, The Velvet Underground, R.E.M., and X.

==Author==
Hersh&#x27;s illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;Toby Snax&quot; was published in 2007 and further developed in 2011 as an interactive app for children. The app allows children to hear her read the story out loud and features her recordings of lullabies that she learned as a girl in Tennessee.

Her 2010 memoir &quot;Rat Girl&quot; (published in the UK as &quot;Paradoxical Undressing&quot;) is based on a diary she wrote when she was 18, touring with Throwing Muses, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and pregnant with her first child. Rob Sheffield in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it an &quot;uncommonly touching punk memoir,&quot; and named it #8 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;25 Greatest Rock Memoirs of All Time.&quot; Her 2015 book &quot;Don&#x27;t Suck, Don&#x27;t Die: Giving Up Vic Chesnutt&quot;, is a rumination on her friendship with the singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt. She cites him as being one of her songwriting influences with his &quot;fluid timing and the grace of a melody that breaks the rules of meter.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hersh was married to her former manager Billy O&#x27;Connell for 25 years and they divorced in 2013. They have four sons. , she is engaged to former Throwing Muses bassist Fred Abong.

Hersh has talked openly about her bouts with mental illness and its role in her musical process. When she was 16, she was struck by a car while riding her bicycle, suffering a double concussion that affected the way she heard sounds. She described it as hearing ambient sounds continuously and &quot;the sounds would alter their sonic vocabulary until I was hearing syllables, and drums... then all these words would come&quot;. She has said that hearing &quot;pieces of songs&quot; in her mind compelled her to take the pieces apart and craft songs from them. She claims that she doesn&#x27;t remember writing her early songs—that &quot;they wrote her&quot;. Hersh has synesthesia; she sees musical chords in colors.

She has had more than one diagnosis (and misdiagnoses) for her condition including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and most recently post-traumatic and dissociative disorders, which she says have been successfully treated with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy.

<text>Cnicht is a mountain in Snowdonia which forms part of the Moelwynion mountain range.

== Features ==
Its appearance when viewed from the south-west, i.e., from the direction of Porthmadog, has earned it the sobriquet the &quot;Matterhorn of Wales&quot;, albeit being 3,789 metres lower. In reality, Cnicht is a long ridge and, at 689 m, is the fifth-highest peak in the Moelwynion mountain range. It can be easily ascended from Croesor, the village at its foot, or, with more difficulty, from Nant Gwynant to the northwest.

Although regarded by some as a mountain in its own right, Cnicht does not have the required 150m of topographic prominence to be classed as a Marilyn.

== Toponymy ==
The mountain&#x27;s name is thought to derive from the English surname Knight, the name of a family who were formerly merchants in Caernarfon. When borrowed into Welsh, the consonants represented by and were still pronounced in English, and these are retained in the Welsh name &quot;Cnicht&quot; as (/k/) and (/χ/).

== In fiction ==
It appears as the &quot;Saeth&quot; in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;Three Bear Witness&quot; (published as &quot;Testimonies&quot; in the USA), which is set in a fictionalised version of Cwm Croesor. O&#x27;Brian and his wife lived in the valley between 1946 and 1949.

<doc id="845619" wikidata="Q1867493" url="?curid=845619" title="50 Foot Wave">
<text>50 Foot Wave (often stylized as 50FOOTWAVE) is an American alternative rock band, formed in 2003. The band is fronted by Kristin Hersh, who writes the group&#x27;s songs with collaborative efforts from the other group members in composing and arranging the music. The group&#x27;s name is a reference to both an illustration and the term for the 50-foot sound wave of the lowest F tone audible to the human ear. The band sometimes abbreviates its name as &quot;L&#x27;~&quot;, using the Roman numeral for 50.

== History ==

Kristin Hersh previously spent more than two decades playing with Throwing Muses, releasing several solo albums as well. Her solo tours in the late 1990s and early 2000s focused on acoustic guitar playing. In 2003, she launched the more electric guitar-oriented 50FOOTWAVE.

The band was designed as a power trio, with a lineup including drummer Rob Ahlers and Throwing Muses bassist Bernard Georges. Hersh contributes guitar, lyrics, and vocals to this project. The band&#x27;s first live performance was recorded in Burbank in October 2003 and released on a very limited basis as an official bootleg. Among other live appearances internationally in 2004, 50 Foot Wave performed a month-long residency of shows in January that year at the Silverlake Lounge, while the group was based in the Los Angeles area. The group&#x27;s self-titled studio mini-album was co-released in March 2004 by the band&#x27;s ThrowingMusic label and 4AD Records.

Hersh has described 50FOOTWAVE&#x27;s music as &quot;having a lot of math in it,&quot; while also calling it less emotionally and musically &quot;tangled&quot; than some of her past Throwing Muses work. Others have described some of the new songs as having &quot;confrontational&quot; lyrics.

In March 2005, the group released its long-planned, full-length album, &quot;Golden Ocean&quot;, on ThrowingMusic, in partnership with 4AD.

The group toured Europe and the United States in 2005, while Hersh simultaneously continued her solo concerts in alternating parts of the year.

In December 2005, the band released a new EP called &quot;Free Music!&quot; available via free FLAC and mp3 downloads at their website and several download partner sites. The downloads reserved some rights though Creative Commons licenses.

In early March 2009, the band released all their previous albums along with a selection of live tracks, an Instrumental EP and the upcoming &quot;Power+Light&quot; album for download at their website. As before, the tracks were available in FLAC and mp3 format and the band reserved some rights though Creative Commons licenses.

In early 2010, the band announced that its new EP would be titled &quot;With Love from the Men&#x27;s Room&quot;. The 5-track disc was recorded in Highland Park, CA, and it was released in January, 2012. Once again, the band released the music with Creative Commons licensing, and the liner notes encourage fans to &quot;SHARE THIS MUSIC -- You are encouraged to repost, podcast, make videos, record covers, burn copies for friends, burn copies for enemies, USE it. Anything, everything is ok with us. What matters most to us is that people hear, connect with, and pass on this band&#x27;s music&quot;.

<text>Magdalena Abakanowicz (; 20 June 1930 – 20 April 2017) was a Polish sculptor and fiber artist. Known for her use of textiles as a sculptural medium and for outdoor installations, Abakanowicz has been considered among the most influential Polish artists of the postwar era. She worked as a professor of studio art at the University of Fine Arts in Poznań, Poland, from 1965 to 1990, and as a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles in 1984.

She was born to a noble landowning family in Falenty, near Warsaw, before the outbreak of World War II. Her formative years were marred by the Nazi occupation of Poland, during which her family became part of the Polish resistance. After the war, under the imposed communist rule, Abakanowicz attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Sopot and the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw between 1950 and 1954, navigating a conservative educational environment marked by the imposition of Soviet-dictated restrictive and propagandistic doctrine of Socialist Realism.

The Polish October and subsequent political and cultural thaw in 1956 marked a significant turning point in Abakanowicz&#x27;s career. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Abakanowicz&#x27;s work began to take on more structure and geometric form, influenced in part by Constructivism. Her one-person exhibit at the Kordegarda Gallery in Warsaw in 1960 signaled her emergence in the Polish textile and fiber design movement. She received first international recognition following her participation in the first Biennale Internationale de le Tapisserie in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1962.

Abakanowicz&#x27;s most celebrated works emerged in the 1960s with her creation of three-dimensional fiber works called &quot;Abakans&quot;. During the 1970s and 1980s, she transitioned to creating humanoid sculptures. These works reflected the anonymity and confusion of the individual amidst the human mass, a theme influenced by her life under a Communist regime. Some of her prominent international public artworks include &quot;Agora&quot; in Chicago and &quot;Birds of Knowledge of Good and Evil&quot; in Milwaukee.

==Early life==
Marta Magdalena Abakanowicz (married name Kosmowska) was born to a noble landowning family in the village of Falenty, near Warsaw. Her mother, Helena Domaszewska, descended from old Polish nobility. Her father, Konstanty Abakanowicz, came from a Polonized Lipka Tatar family that traced its origins to Abaqa Khan, a 13th-century Mongol chieftain. Her father&#x27;s family fled Russia to the newly re-established democratic Poland in the aftermath of the October Revolution.

When she was nine, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland. Her family endured the war years living on the outskirts of Warsaw and became part of the Polish resistance. At the age of 14 she became a nurse&#x27;s aid in a Warsaw hospital; seeing the impact of war first hand would later influence her art. After the war, the family moved to the small city of Tczew near Gdańsk, in northern Poland, where they hoped to start a new life.

Under the newly-imposed communist doctrine, the Polish government officially adopted socialist realism as the only acceptable art form which should be pursued by artists; it had to be &#x27;national in form&#x27; and &#x27;socialist in content&#x27;. Other art forms being practiced at the time in the Western Bloc, such as Modernism, were officially outlawed and heavily censored in all Communist Bloc nations, including Poland. Lack of official approval did nothing to reduce her enthusiasm or alter the revolutionary course of her work.

== Education ==
Abakanowicz completed part of her high school education in Tczew from 1945 to 1947, after which she went to Gdynia for two additional years of art school at the Liceum Sztuk Plastycznych in that city. After her graduation from the Liceum in 1949, Abakanowicz attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Sopot (now in Gdańsk). In 1950, Abakanowicz moved back to Warsaw to begin her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts there, the leading art school in Poland. To get into the Academy she had to pretend to be the daughter of a clerk, because her noble background would otherwise have prevented her acceptance on the course.

Her years at the university, 1950–1954, coincided with some of the harshest assaults made on art by the leaders of the Eastern Bloc. By utilizing the doctrine of &#x27;Socialist realism&#x27;, all art forms in communist nations were forced to adhere to strict guidelines and limitations that subordinated the arts to the needs and demands of the State. Realist artistic depictions based on the national 19th-century academic tradition were the only form of artistic expression taught in Poland at the time. The Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts, being the most important artistic institution in Poland, came under special scrutiny from the Ministry of Art and Culture, which administered all major decisions in the field at the time.

Abakanowicz found the climate at the Academy to be highly &quot;rigid&quot; and overly &quot;conservative&quot;. She recalled:
While studying at the university she was required to take several textile design classes, learning the art of weaving, screen printing, and fiber design from instructors such as Anna Sledziewska, Eleonora Plutyńska, and Maria Urbanowicz. These instructors and skills would greatly influence Abakanowicz&#x27;s work, as well as that of other prominent Polish artists of the time.

==First artworks==

Following her education at the Academy, Abakanowicz began to produce her first artistic works. Due to the fact that she spent most of her academic life moving from place to place, much of her earlier artwork was lost or damaged, with only a few, delicate plant drawings surviving. Between 1956 and 1959, she produced some of her earliest known works; a series of large gouaches and watercolors on paper and sewn-together linen sheets. These works, described as being &#x27;biomorphic&quot; in composition, depicted imaginary plants, birds, exotic fish, and seashells, among other biomorphic shapes and forms. Joanna Inglot wrote in &quot;The Figurative Sculpture of Magdalena Abakanowicz&quot; about these early works: &quot;[they] pointed to Abakanowicz&#x27;s early fascination with the natural world and its processes of germination, growth, blooming, and sprouting. They seem to capture the very energy of life, a quality that would become a constant feature of her art.&quot; Abakanowicz said:

It was also during this time that the Polish People&#x27;s Republic began to lift some of the heavy political pressures imposed by the Soviet Union, mainly due to the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. In 1956, under the new party leadership of Władysław Gomułka, Poland experienced a dramatic social and cultural shift during the Polish October. The shift resulted in the liberalization of the forms and content of art, with Stalinist methods of art form being openly criticized by Gomułka&#x27;s government.

A major freedom granted to Polish artists was the permission to travel to several Western cities, such as Paris, Venice, Munich, and New York City, to experience artistic developments outside the communist countries. This liberalization of the arts in Poland and injection of other art forms into the Polish art world greatly influenced Abakanowicz&#x27;s early works, as she began to consider much of her early work as being too flamboyant and lacking in structure. Constructivism began to influence her work in the late 1950s as she adopted a more geometric and structured approach. Never fully accepting Constructivism, she searched for her own &quot;artistic language and for a way to make her art more tactile, intuitive, and personal.&quot; As a result, she soon adopted weaving as another avenue of artistic exploration.

In her first one-person exhibit at the Kordegarda Gallery in Warsaw in the spring of 1960, she included a series of four weavings along with a collection of gouaches and watercolors. Though her first exhibit received minimal critical notice, it helped advance her position within the Polish textile and fiber design movement and resulted in her inclusion into the first Biennale Internationale de le Tapisserie in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1962. The event opened the way to her international success.

Over the next few years, she challenged the established idea that weaving could not be fine art, by using metal supports and pulling the pieces away from the walls thus making woven but increasingly sculptural work.

==Series==
=== &quot;Abakans&quot; ===
The 1960s saw some of the most important works produced during Abakanowicz&#x27;s career. In 1967, she began producing three-dimensional fiber works called &quot;Abakans&quot;. Her &quot;Abakans&quot; were included in a group exhibition titled, &quot;Wall Hangings&quot;, organised in 1969 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York by Mildred Constantine, curator of architecture and design, and the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen. Abakanowicz and the other artists included in the exhibition were pushing boundaries between high art and traditional definitions of what was considered craft. Her use of &quot;unexpected, often soft materials, arranged in modular or serial structures” in her &quot;Abakan&quot; series, places her within the Postminimalism art movement that began in 1966. Abakanowicz stated that she sought the “total obliteration of the utilitarian function of tapestry” and demonstrated the capacity of fiber to produce forms that were soft yet structured and complex.

Each &quot;Abakan&quot; is made out of woven material using Abakanowicz&#x27;s own technique. The material used for many of these pieces was found, often collecting sisal ropes from harbors, intertwining them into threads and dying them. She also used &quot;rope, hemp, flax, wool and horsehair.&quot; Hung from the ceiling, &quot;Abakans&quot; reach sizes as large as thirteen feet with sometimes only a few inch clearance from the ground. The Abakans often incorporated reproductive references to eggs and the womb.

One of her large &quot;Abakans&quot; is included in the collection of the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas. The piece hangs on the wall and is made of five large recycled sisal panels in varying thickness and dyed in a burnt umber color. The work was acquired in 2019 and was exhibited in an exhibition titled &quot;Resist/Release&quot;.

In October 2023, Abakanowicz&#x27;s pioneering textile art served as inspiration for the latest collection from the Alexander McQueen fashion house, which debuted at the Paris Fashion Week. The designs were created by Sarah Burton and were met with high acclaim as they were presented alongside two Abakans from the collection of the Central Textile Museum in Łódź.

===Humanoid sculptures===

During the 1970s, and into the 1980s, Abakanowicz changed medium and scale; she began a series of figurative and non-figurative sculptures made out of pieces of coarse sackcloth which she sewed and pieced together and bonded with synthetic resins. These works became more representational than previous sculptures but still retain a degree of abstraction and ambiguity. In 1974-1975 she produced sculptures called &quot;Alterations&quot;, which were twelve hollowed-out headless human figures sitting in a row. From 1973–1975 she produced a series of enormous, solid forms reminiscent of human heads without faces called &quot;Heads&quot;. From 1976-1980 she produced a piece call &quot;Backs&quot;, which was a series of eighty slightly differing sculptures of the human trunk.

In 1986-87 she created a series of fifty standing figures called &quot;Crowd I&quot;. She also began to once again work around organic structures, such as her &quot;Embryology&quot; series, which consisted of several dozen soft egg-like lumps varying in size. These were dispersed round an exhibition room at the Vienna Biennial in 1980.

These humanoid works of the 1970s and 1980s were centered around human culture and nature as a whole and its condition and position in modern society. The multiplicity of the human forms represents confusion and anonymity, analyzing an individual&#x27;s presence in a mass of humanity. These works have close connections to Abakanowicz&#x27;s life living in a Communist regime which repressed individual creativity and intellect in favor of the collective interest. These works also contrast with her earlier &quot;Abakan&quot; series, which were individually powerful pieces, whereas the figurative sculptures lost their individuality in favor of multiplicity.

In the late 1980s to 1990s Abakanowicz began to use metals, such as bronze, for her sculptures, as well as wood, stone, and clay. Her works from this period include &quot;Bronze Crowd&quot; (1990–91), shown in the garden of the Nasher Sculpture Center, and &quot;Puellae&quot; (1992), part of the National Gallery of Art&#x27;s collection. She stated in a speech given at the Academy of Fine Arts in Łódź:

In 2019, her work featuring humanoid sculptures entitled &quot;Caminando&quot;, from the private collection of Robin Williams, set a new record at auction for an artwork sold in Poland by fetching 8 million zlotys (ca. US$2.1 million). This record was broken again twice in 2021 when in October another of her works known as &quot;Crowd III&quot; (1989) fetched 13.2 million zlotys (ca. $3.3 million) while in December her &quot;Bambini&quot; (1999) set of sculptures was sold for 13.6 million zloty.

===&quot;War Games&quot;===
One of Abakanowicz&#x27;s most unusual works is titled &quot;War Games&quot;, which is a cycle of monumental structures made up of huge trunks of old trees, with their branches and bark removed. Partly bandaged with rags and hugged by steel hoops, these sculptures are placed on lattice metal stands. Like the name of the cycle implies, these sculptures have a very militaristic feel to them, as they have been compared to artillery vehicles. During the 1990s Abakanowicz was also commissioned to design a model of an ecologically-oriented city. She also choreographed dance.

===&quot;Agora&quot;===

Abakanowicz&#x27;s final round of work includes a project called &quot;Agora&quot;, which is a permanent installation located at the southern end of Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park, next to the Roosevelt Road Metra station. It consists of 106 cast iron figures, each about nine feet tall. All the figures are similar in shape, but different in details. The artist and her three assistants created models for each figure by hand, and the casting took place from 2004 to 2006. The surface of each figure resembles a tree bark or wrinkled skin. The work creates a feeling of crowdedness, hence the name &quot;agora&quot;. Furthermore, all the bodies are headless and armless giving them an eerie, anonymous look.

==Quotes==

&quot;I feel overawed by quantity where counting no longer makes sense. By unrepeatability within such a quantity. By creatures of nature gathered in herds, droves, species, in which each individual, while subservient to the mass, retains some distinguishing features. A crowd of people, birds, insects, or leaves is a mysterious assemblage of variants of certain prototype. A riddle of nature&#x27;s abhorrence of exact repetition or inability to produce it. Just as the human hand cannot repeat its own gesture, I invoke this disturbing law, switching my own immobile herds into that rhythm.&quot;

&quot;Art will remain the most astonishing activity of mankind born out of struggle between wisdom and madness, between dream and reality in our mind.&quot;

<doc id="845630" wikidata="Q7320657" url="?curid=845630" title="Rhinogydd">
<text>The Rhinogydd (a Welsh plural form, often anglicised as Rhinogs and also known by the alternative Welsh plural Rhinogau) are a range of mountains located east of Harlech in North Wales. The name &quot;Rhinogydd&quot; derives from the names of two of the more famous peaks, Rhinog Fawr and Rhinog Fach, although the greatest elevation in the range is reached by Y Llethr, 756 m (2,480 feet).

Foel Penolau, the northernmost summit of the range, was promoted to a Hewitt in 2018 due to a new survey.

The Rhinogydd are notably rocky and heather-clad towards the northern end of the range, especially around Rhinog Fawr, Rhinog Fach and towards Moel Ysgyfarnogod. The southern end, around Y Llethr, Diffwys and the Ysgethin Valley has a softer, grassy character.

A population of feral goats are in the range. Over 30 km² are protected as a Special Area of Conservation and a National Nature Reserve.

==Geology==
The Rhinogydd are formed of hard sedimentary rocks of Cambrian age which occur as a major anticlinal structure known to geologists as the Harlech Dome. This structure which originated during the Caledonian Orogeny (mountain-building period) extends from Cadair Idris in the south to Blaenau Ffestiniog in the north. Its erosion by successive glaciations has left the valleys and peaks of the Rhinogydd visible today. The core of the area is formed from the hard-wearing greywackes of the Rhinog Formation. The formation also contains and is overlain by some siltstones and mudstones which form a broken zone of softer scenery around the periphery of the area&#x27;s rugged core. In places, swarms of dolerite dykes cut through the country rocks in a generally northwest–southeast direction. Much of the lower ground is mantled by glacial till, a legacy of the last glaciation.

===History of geological investigations===
The geology of the area was first characterised by Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison in 1835. The Geological Survey began work in the area in 1846 and their first maps were published in 1855. With the discovery of gold in the area in 1846 the state of geological knowledge increased dramatically. At least a dozen major publications appeared between 1844 and 1939.

==Hillwalking in the Rhinogydd==

The Rhinogydd are far less well known than the areas in the north of the Snowdonia National Park, such as the Glyderau, Carneddau and the Snowdon massif itself. This is due to the rugged nature of the landscape in the Rhinogydd and the fame of Snowdon as the highest peak in Wales. The Rhinog mountains are popular with hillwalkers looking for a more isolated, wilder walking experience.

The peaks of the range are most easily accessed from the west side. Two valleys - Cwm Nantcol (&#x27;valley of the Nantcol (stream)&#x27;) and Cwm Bychan (&#x27;small valley&#x27;) - lead deep into the mountains and may be reached from the village of Llanbedr.

The most popular walking route in this area begins at the Roman Steps at 
, which leads from Cwm Bychan through Bwlch Tyddiad and around Rhinog Fawr. Despite the name, these steps are not Roman and are in fact the well preserved remains of a medieval packhorse trail leading from Chester to Harlech Castle. At the top of the Roman Steps, the route curves around the eastern end of Rhinog Fawr and enters Cwm Nantcol via Bwlch Drws Ardudwy (&#x27;pass of the doorway of Ardudwy&#x27;). A different path leads from Cwm Nantcol, passing around the western end of Rhinog Fawr back to Cwm Bychan via Gloywlyn (&#x27;gleaming lake&#x27;), completing a circular route that can easily be completed in a day.

==Main peaks==

The range contains the following Marilyns:
*Y Llethr 756 m
*Rhinog Fawr 720 m
*Rhinog Fach 712 m
*Y Garn 629 m
*Moel Ysgyfarnogod 623 m
*Moelfre 589 m

the following Hewitts:
*Diffwys 750 m
*Foel Penolau 614 m

and the following Nuttalls:
*Crib-y-rhiw 670 m
*Diffwys West Top 642 m

<text>Kathiawar () is a peninsula, near the far north of India&#x27;s west coast, of about bordering the Arabian Sea. It is bounded by the Gulf of Kutch in the northwest and by the Gulf of Khambhat in the east. In the northeast, it is connected to the rest of Gujarat and borders on the low, fertile hinterland of Ahmedabad. It is crossed by two belts of hill country and is drained radially by nine rivers which have little natural flow aside from in monsoon months, thus dams have been built on some of these. Kathiawar ports have been flourishing centres of trade and commerce since at least the 16th century.

== Etymology and history ==
The name Kathiawad seems to have been derived from the early settlements of Kathikas or Kathis who entered Gujarat from Sindh in early centuries of the Common Era.

== History ==

=== Literary comment ===

The state of the region in the early nineteenth century is shown in Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration, &quot;Scene in Kattiawar&quot;, to an engraving of a painting by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield.

== Districts in Kathiawad Region ==
* Amreli
* Bhavnagar
* Botad
* Junagadh
* Gir Somnath
* Devbhumi Dwarka
* Jamnagar
* Rajkot
* Porbandar
* Morbi
* Surendranagar

== Geography and ecosystem ==

The natural vegetation on most of the peninsula is xeric scrub. A range of low hills known as the Gir Hills occupies the south-central portion of the peninsula. The highest of these is Girnar. The hills are home to an enclave of tropical dry broadleaf forest.

Gir National Park and its surroundings host the last remaining Asiatic lion population. Other national parks in Kathiawar are Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar on the Gulf of Cambay, and Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch, near Jamnagar.

== Antiquity (places: history, archaeology, nature, religion) ==

<text>LIBRA - Party of Liberal Democrats ( or LIBRA for short, also spelled Libra) was a short-lived Croatian social-liberal political party active between September 2002 and August 2005. During its existence the party ran in only one parliamentary election, in 2003, and won three seats in the 151-seat 5th Assembly of the Croatian Parliament.

LIBRA was formed in July 2002 and formally registered in September that year, following a split in the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) when a faction led by Jozo Radoš, then defence minister in the Cabinet of Ivica Račan I, opposed HSLS leader Dražen Budiša&#x27;s decision to leave the ruling five-party centre-left coalition dominated by SDP, in the hopes of provoking an early election. However, then Prime Minister Ivica Račan managed to avoid a fresh election by forming a reconstructed Cabinet of Ivica Račan II on 30 July 2002, with the newly formed LIBRA holding two seats in the cabinet - Goran Granić as Deputy Prime Minister, and Roland Žuvanić as Minister for Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications.

Until the end of the 4th Assembly in October 2003, the party was represented in the Croatian Parliament with nine members, all former HSLS members, with Ivo Škrabalo as head of the party club.

LIBRA then ran in the November 2003 election as a junior partner in a centre-left coalition with Social Democratic Party (SDP), Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) and the Liberal Party (LS). The coalition lost the election to the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), winning a total of 43 seats in a 151-seat parliament, out of which only 3 belonged to LIBRA.

In February 2005 party members voted to merge with the Croatian People&#x27;s Party (HNS) which changed its name in Croatian People&#x27;s Party - Liberal Democrats (HNS-LD or, more commonly, just HNS). Two of LIBRA&#x27;s MPs in the 5th Assembly, Jozo Radoš and Vilim Herman, joined HNS, while the third, Željko Pavlic, resigned his party membership to become independent.

In August 2005 the party was formally struck from the party register.

<text>USS &quot;Johnston&quot; (DD-557) was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was named after Lieutenant John V. Johnston, an officer of the US Navy during the American Civil War. &quot;Johnston&quot; was laid down in May 1942 and was launched on 25 March 1943. She entered active duty on 27 October 1943 under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ernest E. Evans and was assigned to the US Pacific Fleet. &quot;Johnston&quot; provided naval gunfire support for American ground forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in January and February 1944 and again, after three months of patrol and escort duty in the Solomon Islands, during the recapture of Guam in July. Thereafter, &quot;Johnston&quot; was tasked with escorting escort carriers during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the liberation of the Philippines.

On 25 October 1944, while assigned as part of the escort to six escort carriers, &quot;Johnston&quot;, two other &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers, and four destroyer escorts were engaged by a large Imperial Japanese Navy flotilla. In what became known as the Battle off Samar, &quot;Johnston&quot; and the other escort ships charged the Japanese ships to protect nearby US carriers and transport craft. After engaging several Japanese capital ships and a destroyer squadron, &quot;Johnston&quot; was sunk with 187 dead, including Evans. &quot;Johnston&quot;″s wreck was discovered on 30 October 2019 but was not properly identified until March 2021. Lying more than below the surface of the ocean, it was the deepest shipwreck ever surveyed until the 22 June 2022 discovery of , sunk during the same engagement.

==Design and characteristics==
To rectify the top-heaviness and stability problems of the preceding and es, the &quot;Fletcher&quot; class was greatly increased in size over the older designs. This allowed them to accept additional anti-aircraft (AA) guns and electronic equipment as well as their operators without sacrificing guns or torpedoes as the older ships were forced to do during the war. The &quot;Fletcher&quot;s displaced at standard load and at deep load, roughly 30 percent more than the &quot;Benson&quot;s and &quot;Gleaves&quot;.

In early 1942, the design of the &quot;Fletcher&quot;s was modified to reduce top weight and to simplify the construction of the bridge by squaring off the curves at its front. One deck was removed from the aft superstructure and the base of the fire-control director above the bridge was shortened by . The splinter plating protecting the bridge and the director was also reduced in thickness. In addition, visibility from the bridge was improved by the addition of an open platform connected to the bridge wings.

The ships had an overall length of , with a draft of and beam of . The ships were powered by two General Electric geared steam turbines that each drove one propeller shaft using steam provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines produced which was intended to give the ships a top speed of . The destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . They were crewed by 9 officers and 264 enlisted men.

===Armament, fire control, protection and sensors===
The main battery of the &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers consisted of five dual-purpose /38 caliber guns in single mounts which were grouped in superfiring pairs fore and after of the superstructure. The fifth mount was positioned on the aft superstructure forward of the aft pair. The guns were controlled by the Mark 37 director. Their anti-aircraft battery depended on the availability of the weapons, but &quot;Johnston&quot; was built with ten Bofors guns in five powered twin-gun mounts and seven manually operated Oerlikon cannons. The forward pair of Bofors mounts were located forward of the bridge and the second pair were on platforms abreast the aft funnel with one mount on each broadside; the last mount was positioned between the aft superfiring pair of guns and the single mounts forward of them. Each mount was controlled by a nearby Mark 51 director. Four Oerlikons were located amidships, two on each broadside, and three were grouped in a triangle at the stern, next to the depth charge racks.

The ships were fitted with two racks, each holding eight depth charges and adjacent to them were two storage racks with five depth charges each. Abreast the aft superstructure were six &quot;K-gun&quot; throwers, three on each side, with five depth charges. The destroyers were equipped with two quintuple rotating torpedo tube mounts for Mark 15 torpedoes.

The &quot;Fletcher&quot;s had only minimal armor that was intended to protect against shell splinters and fragments. The sides of the propulsion machinery compartments consisted of plates of special treatment steel (STS) while the deck above them consisted of STS. The &quot;square bridge&quot; ships like &quot;Johnston&quot; had the splinter armor of the bridge reduced from the 0.75-inch armor of the earlier &quot;round bridge&quot; ships to . Furthermore, the protective plating of the Mark 37 director was reduced from the earlier 0.75 inches to 0.5 inches.

The &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers were equipped with a Mark 4 or Mark 12 fire-control radar on the roof of the Mark 37 director. A SC-2 early-warning radar and a SG surface-search radar were fitted on the foremast. For anti-submarine work, the ships used a QC series sonar.

==Construction and service history==
Construction of &quot;Johnston&quot;, named after Lieutenant John V. Johnston, an officer of the US Navy during the American Civil War, began with the laying of her keel at the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s yard on 6 May 1942. Her launch, sponsored by Marie S. Klinger, Lt. Johnston&#x27;s grandniece, took place on 25 March 1943. &quot;Johnston&quot; was finally commissioned into the United States Navy and placed under the command of Lieutenant Commander Ernest E. Evans, a man of Native American Cherokee descent who previously commanded the elderly destroyer USS Alden which partook in the Battle of the Java Sea, on 27 October 1943. She then sailed to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and fitted out into early November. On 15 November, &quot;Johnston&quot; sailed for San Diego, California. From 19 November to 1 January 1944, &quot;Johnston&quot; put out to sea for her shakedown cruise and her crew trained with fleet units near San Diego.

===Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign===

On 13 January 1944 &quot;Johnston&quot; set sail for Hawaii with a US Navy squadron led by Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf and arrived 21 January. From there, &quot;Johnston&quot; sailed to join the ongoing campaign against the Japanese Empire in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. She arrived by 29 January and was assigned to Fire Support Group 53.5 under Oldendorf. On 30 January, she screened for the cruisers , , , and the battleship as they provided naval gunfire support for American forces in the Wotje Atoll. &quot;Johnston&quot; sailed for the Kwajalein Atoll, where from 31 January to 3 February she provided gunfire support for American forces attacking Roi-Namur Island.

&quot;Johnston&quot; was reassigned on 5 February 1944 to escort transport ships to the Ellice Islands with destroyers and , and the destroyer-minesweeper . The convoy set sail on 6 February but en route &quot;Johnston&quot; was ordered to return to the Marshalls for resupply. She arrived on 8 February, refueled, and then set sail for Kwajalein on 10 February. Her arrival was delayed until the next day after jellyfish clogged and overheated her condensers.

Almost as soon &quot;Johnston&quot; arrived, she was tasked with investigating a sighting of a Japanese submarine. No such vessel was detected. Early on 12 February, Japanese bombers attacked Roi-Namur, inflicting heavy casualties to the occupying Americans. In response to their detection on radar, &quot;Johnston&quot; and the other present American ships laid smoke to obscure their positions. They were not attacked. Over the next three days, &quot;Johnston&quot; resupplied, took on supplies from , 5 in shells from , and fuel oil from . &quot;Johnston&quot; was then attached to Operation Catchpole, the American attack on Enewetak Atoll. From 16 to 18 February, &quot;Johnston&quot; screened for , , , &quot;Indianapolis&quot;, and cruisers and as they bombarded Engebi Island. Then, from 19 to 25 February, &quot;Johnston&quot; provided gunfire support for American troops herself and patrolled for submarines.

===Solomon Islands campaign===
On 25 February 1944, &quot;Johnston&quot; was relieved of patrol duty and was assigned to screen the escort carrier with . The trio was ordered back to the Marshall Islands on 28 February and arrived on 1 March. &quot;Johnston&quot; resupplied over the next five days. On 7 March the flotilla, joined by , sailed for Espiritu Santo and arrived on 13 March. &quot;Johnston&quot; docked in the auxiliary floating drydock for minor repairs from 18 to 19 March, then set out for the Solomon Islands on 20 March. She arrived at Purvis Bay, near Guadalcanal, the following day and was subsequently assigned to patrol duties around New Ireland. On 27–28 March, &quot;Johnston&quot; and her sister ships , , and were dispatched to bombard Kapingamarangi Atoll, in the Caroline Islands. Upon their return to the Solomons on 29 March, the destroyers were assigned additional patrol duties. For the rest of March and all of April, they patrolled the northern Solomons, escorted Allied shipping to and from them, and occasionally provided gunfire support for the US Army&#x27;s XIV Corps on Bougainville Island.

&quot;Johnston&quot; began May 1944 moored in Purvis Bay undergoing minor repairs. On 6 May, she sailed to New Georgia with &quot;Franks&quot;, &quot;Haggard&quot;, &quot;Hailey&quot;, and &quot;Hoel&quot; to screen for and and then for a minelaying operation between Bougainville and Buka Island on 10 May. Two days later, &quot;Haggard&quot;, &quot;Franks&quot; and &quot;Johnston&quot; were alerted by an American scout plane to the presence of the off Buka. The destroyers immediately began searching for the vessel and, late on 16 May, discovered it. &quot;Haggard&quot;, then &quot;Johnston&quot;, and then &quot;Franks&quot; attacked the submarine with depth charges and sank it after midnight on 17 May. The destroyers resumed their anti-submarine patrols on 18 May, then screened for &quot;Montpelier&quot;, &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and as they shelled Japanese coastal guns on the Shortland Islands two days later. &quot;Johnston&quot; thereafter resumed patrol and escort duty, then docked with the destroyer tender for minor repairs from 27 May to 2 June.

===Mariana and Palau Islands campaign===


On 3 June 1944, &quot;Johnston&quot; joined a convoy of US warships headed to Kwajalein to join a fleet gathering to recapture Guam. The convoy arrived on 8 June, then made for Guam four days later with the invasion force and arrived by 18 June. The ongoing Battle of Saipan, however, delayed the invasion. On 30 June, the fleet was ordered to return to Kwajalein; &quot;Johnston&quot; arrived on 3 July and returned to patrol duty. When the invasion force was ordered back to Guam on 14 July, &quot;Johnston&quot; again sailed as part of its screen. The fleet arrived four days later. From 21 July to 1 August, &quot;Johnston&quot; joined several battleships, cruisers, and destroyers to furnish gunfire support for the 1st Marine Brigade and the 77th Infantry Division. Afterwards, from 2 to 9 August, she screened for American ships. On 9 August, &quot;Johnston&quot; was ordered, with &quot;Franks&quot;, &quot;Haggard&quot;, &quot;Haily&quot;, , , , &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and to return to the Marshalls.

The flotilla arrived on 12 August, resupplied, and then sailed for Espiritu Santo from 19 to 24 August. Three days later, after undergoing minor repairs, &quot;Johnston&quot; set sail for Purvis Bay with &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, , &quot;Louisville&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, and seven other destroyers. The flotilla arrived on 29 August and joined escort carriers , , , , with whom &quot;Johnston&quot; trained for carrier escort duty. On 4 September, &quot;Johnston&quot;, &quot;Haggard&quot;, &quot;Hailey&quot;, and , escorting &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, &quot;Kalinan Bay&quot;, and , set sail for the Palau Islands and the invasions of Peleliu and of Angaur. &quot;Johnston&quot; escorted these escort carriers until 18 September, when &quot;Johnston&quot; was reassigned to escort , , and . &quot;Johnston&quot; and her charges received orders on 21 September to proceed to Ulithi, an atoll in the Caroline Islands, where they arrived on 23 September.

=== Battle off Samar ===
The flotilla departed Ulithi on 25 September 1944 and arrived in Seeadler Harbor, in the Admiralty Islands on 1 October 1944. There, on 12 October, &quot;Johnston&quot; was assigned to the US 7th Fleet, which was preparing to invade the Philippines. &quot;Johnston&quot; was attached, with &quot;Hoel&quot;, , and the destroyer escorts , , , and , to the escort carriers , , &quot;White Plains&quot;, &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, &quot;Kalinin Bay&quot;, and &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;. These ships formed TU 77.4.3 (call sign &quot;Taffy 3&quot;), a sub-unit of the 7th Fleet&#x27;s Escort Carrier Group (TG 77.4) commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, aboard &quot;Fanshaw Bay&quot;, and sailed into Leyte Gulf on 17 October.

In response to the Invasion of the Philippines, on 18 October, the Imperial Japanese Navy dispatched three fleets to cut off and destroy the American ground forces. The largest fleet was placed under the command of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita and took a path that, on 25 October, led it to TG 77.4.

Though Kurita&#x27;s fleet – by 25 October numbering four battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers – had been attacked by US submarines and aircraft over the previous two days, TG 77.4 was not made aware of the Japanese force until Taffy 3&#x27;s surface radar detected it at 0646. &quot;Johnston&quot;, south-east from the Japanese, was informed of its presence at 0650; eight minutes later, the Japanese opened fire, beginning the Battle off Samar. The force was led by Kurita&#x27;s flagship, the battleship , the largest and most powerfully armed and armored battleship ever built, displacing 72,808 tons and armed with nine 18.1-inch (46 cm) guns. Escorting &quot;Yamato&quot; came the older but still capable battleships , , and , six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eleven destroyers.

==== &quot;Johnston&quot;″s torpedo charge ====
At 0657, Sprague ordered Taffy 3 to head east at top speed and lay smoke. Despite the overwhelming odds against the force, finding &quot;Johnston&quot; at the rear of the formation, Commander Ernest E. Evans ordered a turn to the northeast so that &quot;Johnston&quot; could charge the Japanese for a torpedo attack and lay smoke to cover the flotilla&#x27;s escape. Charging at the enemy, &quot;Johnston&quot; would come under fire from several ships. &quot;Nagato&quot; fired a single full salvo from her 16.1-inch (41 cm) guns, while &quot;Haruna&quot; fired numerous 6-inch (152 mm) secondary shells, but all missed their mark as Johnston remained undamaged. At 07:10, &quot;Johnston&quot; singled out a target, the heavy cruiser , leading a column of cruisers, as she sailed into the range of &quot;Johnston&quot;″s 5-inch (127 mm) main battery. &quot;Kumano&quot; and her sister ship fired off numerous salvos, but again, not a single Japanese shell hit the American destroyer. In contrast &quot;Johnston&quot; fired more than 200 main battery shells at &quot;Kumano&quot; over the next five minutes, striking the cruiser at least 45 times and setting her superstructure on fire. Then, having closed to , &quot;Johnston&quot; fired all 10 of her torpedoes at &quot;Kumano&quot; and then turned to hide in her own smoke. The exact number of hits is unknown, but at least one torpedo hit &quot;Kumano&quot; and blew off her bow, forcing her out of the battle alongside &quot;Suzuya&quot; to escort her, right as a 14-inch (356 mm) shell from &quot;Kongō&quot; landed mere inches from Johnston (but did not hit her), spraying red dye on the hull. Dashing back to the escort carriers, Commander Evans forced two heavy cruisers out of the engagement without being hit by a single Japanese projectile.

==== Damage from &quot;Yamato&quot; ====
However, at 0730, at , battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; engaged a US &quot;cruiser&quot; and fired a single full nine gun broadside. Suddenly, three 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells smashed into &quot;Johnston&quot;. Seconds later, three 6.1-inch (155 mm) shells out of six fired from &quot;Yamato&quot;″s secondary battery made their mark. The damage was initially recorded as three 14-inch (356 mm) shells from &quot;Kongō&quot; at a distance of , but Japanese records displayed &quot;Kongō&quot; to be much farther and blinded by a rain squall, unable to fire her guns, as where &quot;Yamato&quot; claimed numerous hits with her main and secondary guns on a US &quot;cruiser&quot; at the same exact moment &quot;Johnston&quot; was hit. The light cruiser and the destroyer also observed &quot;Yamato&quot; sinking a US &quot;cruiser&quot; matching &quot;Johnston&quot;″s location.

Having mistaken &quot;Johnston&quot; for a cruiser&quot;, Yamato&quot; fired armour-piercing ammunition from her main guns, which over penetrated &quot;Johnston&quot;″s unarmored hull without exploding. Still, the damage resulted in numerous casualties as &quot;Yamato&quot;″s 6.1-inch (155 mm) shells mostly landed upon her superstructure. One landed amidships, taking out an AA fire director, while the remaining two hit forward, tearing into the torpedo director and shredding the bridge, blowing off two of Evans&#x27;s fingers and his shirt, and causing the loss of her gyrocompass. Meanwhile, two 18.1-inch (46 cm) shells landed amidships, severely damaging &quot;Johnston&quot;″s engines, cutting her speed to . The remaining 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell hit two thirds down the ship, cutting power to all of &quot;Johnston&quot;″s 5-inch (127 mm) guns. Hidden in her smoke and a rain squall for the next ten minutes, &quot;Johnston&quot;″s crew restored power to the forward main guns. The third was permanently disconnected from fire control and had to be operated manually.

====Defense of the escort carriers====

After turning south to rejoin Taffy 3, &quot;Johnston&quot; encountered &quot;Hoel&quot;, &quot;Heermann&quot;, and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, en route to make their own torpedo attacks. Despite such immense damage, Evans turned &quot;Johnston&quot; around to follow and support them, in the process exchanging gunfire with the heavy cruiser . By 0820, the escorts had launched their torpedoes and turned south, making smoke and still exchanging fire with the Japanese, to rejoin Taffy 3. This was accomplished by 0840, when &quot;Heermann&quot; and &quot;Johnston&quot;, enveloped in smoke, nearly collided. At that time, &quot;Johnston&quot; spotted &quot;Kongō&quot;, distant, fired 30 shells at her, and then evaded returned fire from &quot;Kongō&quot;. &quot;Johnston&quot; next sighted &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, immobile, listing to port, and under fire from numerous warships, and briefly fired on the heavy cruiser as the remaining destroyers attempted to cover her, achieving partial success at their own risk as &quot;Hoel&quot; was sunk by gunfire from &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Yamato&quot;″s secondary battery, while &quot;Chikuma&quot; engaged in an intense point blank range duel with &quot;Heermann&quot; and &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; (&quot;Yamato&quot; still targeted &quot;Gambier Bay&quot; with her main guns, which would later sink at 0911). &quot;Johnston&quot; ceased fire as the light cruiser leading the destroyers &quot;Yukikaze, Isokaze, Urakaze,&quot; and &quot;Nowaki&quot; approached the other carriers.

&quot;Johnston&quot; engaged the entire squadron, opening fire on &quot;Yahagi&quot; at 0850 from 10,000 yards and closed to . &quot;Johnston&quot; attempted to cross the squadron&#x27;s T, limiting them to their forward guns, but the Japanese squadron reacted, turning and engaging the American destroyer with their broadsides. &quot;Johnston&quot; hit &quot;Yahagi&quot; 12 times and was in turn struck by several 5-inch (127 mm) shells. &quot;Yahagi&quot; scored critical damage as at least two 6-inch (152 mm) shells hit the bow and disabled one of &quot;Johnston&quot;″s remaining 5-inch (127 mm) guns, leaving her completely defenseless and starting a large fire that forced the evacuation of the bridge. &quot;Yahagi&quot; was then strafed by US aircraft, turned to starboard and disengaged. &quot;Johnston&quot; turned her fire on the Japanese destroyers, which soon also banked starboard and, with &quot;Yahagi&quot;, discharged their torpedoes at the carriers without effect. The destroyers then focused on &quot;Johnston&quot;, and, in short order, denuded her of her main mast, last engine and gun, rendered the bridge uninhabitable, and set much of the ship ablaze. Evans moved his command to the fantail, where, at 0945, he ordered the crew to abandon ship, as under sustained and intense gunfire damage, &quot;Johnston&quot; began to split apart around two thirds down the ship where she was hit by an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot; earlier in the battle. At 1010, &quot;Johnston&quot; rolled over and sank. As she sank, the crew of the &quot;Yukikaze&quot; sailed past &quot;Johnston&quot; and saluted her crew. Of her complement of 327 men, 186 men and officers died. Commander Ernest E Evans was observed abandoning ship in a lifeboat but was never seen again and presumed dead. The remaining 141 men were rescued by American vessels after 50 hours at sea. &quot;Johnston&quot; was struck from the Navy Register on 27 November 1944.

==Awards==
&quot;Johnston&quot; received six battle stars and, for the action at Samar, a Presidential Unit Citation. For the same action, Commander Evans was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

==Wreck discovery==
On 30 October 2019, the research vessel (RV) , belonging to Vulcan Inc., discovered the remains of what was believed to be &quot;Johnston&quot; at the bottom of the Philippine Trench. The remains consisted of a deck gun, a propeller shaft, and some miscellaneous debris that could not be used to identify the wreck, but additional debris was observed lying deeper than the RV could reach. On 31 March 2021, the research vessel of Caladan Oceanic, financed and piloted by Victor Vescovo, surveyed and photographed the deeper wreck and definitively identified it as &quot;Johnston&quot; at a depth of . Until was discovered on 22 June 2022, &quot;Johnston&quot; was the deepest discovered shipwreck in the world.

Naval historian Parks Stevenson created a 3-D model of &quot;Johnston&quot;″s wreck which shows just how much damage the ship took, and the state the wreck is in. The forward two thirds of the hull still sit upright with her forward 5-inch (127 mm) guns and rangefinder turned to starboard at the enemy ships she faced before she went down. Her hull number, 557, is still a bright white and clearly visible, and her hull is buried in the sand up to the waterline. Enemy damage plagues &quot;Johnston&quot; as shell holes from numerous destroyers and &quot;Yahagi&quot; riddle the ship, punching into the sides and wrecking her superstructure, and &quot;Johnston&quot; split in two where she was hit by an 18.1-inch (46 cm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot;, leaving &quot;Johnston&quot;″s back third undiscovered, if it is even recognizable. Despite that, the bridge is still fully intact and recognizable, with damage from a 6.1-inch (155 mm) shell from &quot;Yamato&quot;″s secondary battery putting a hole beneath where Evans commanded the ship. Her AA guns are still trained, and several holes in &quot;Johnston&quot; line up with accounts of enemy damage (such as a 5-inch (127 mm) destroyer shell plunging into the superstructure and disabling her radio control).

<text>Tarawa is an atoll and the capital of the Republic of Kiribati, in the Micronesia region of the central Pacific Ocean. It comprises North Tarawa, which has 6,629 inhabitants and much in common with other more remote islands of the Gilbert group, and South Tarawa, which has 56,388 inhabitants , half of the country&#x27;s total population. The atoll was the site of the Battle of Tarawa during World War II.

==Etymology==

Tarawa is an old Gilbertese form for &quot;Te Rawa&quot;, meaning &quot;The Passage&quot; (of the Lagoon), named for the unusual large ship channel to the lagoon. In the popular etymology based on Kiribati mythology, Nareau, the God-spider, distinguished &quot;Karawa&quot;, the sky, from &quot;Marawa&quot;, the Sea, from &quot;Tarawa&quot;, the land.

==Geography==
Tarawa has a large lagoon, in total area, and a wide reef. The lagoon is widely open to the ocean, with a large ship pass. Although naturally abundant in fish and shellfish of all kinds, marine resources are being strained by the large and growing population. Drought is frequent, but in normal years rainfall is sufficient to maintain breadfruit, papaya and banana trees as well as coconut and pandanus.

North Tarawa consists of a string of islets from Buariki in the north to Buota in the south. The islets are separated in places by wide channels that are best crossed at low tide, and there is a ferry service between Buota and Abatao. Only Buota is connected by road to South Tarawa, via a bridge.

On South Tarawa, the construction of causeways has now created a single strip of land from Betio in the west to Tanaea in the northeast. Previously, Benito, the site of the battle of Tarawa, was only 291 acres in size. 

===Climate===

Tarawa features a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification. The climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to . From November to March, western gales bring rain and occasional cyclones.

Precipitation varies significantly between islands. For example, the annual average is 3,000 mm (120 in) in the north and 500 mm (20 in) in the south of the Gilbert Islands. Most of these islands are in the dry belt of the equatorial oceanic climatic zone and experience prolonged droughts.

==Administration==

Tarawa atoll has three administrative subdivisions: Betio Town Council (or BTC), on Betio Islet; (or TUC), from Bairiki to Tanaea; and Eutan Tarawa Council (or ETC), for North Tarawa or &quot;Tarawa Ieta&quot;, consisting of all the islets on the east side from Buota northwards. The meaning of &quot;Te inainano&quot; in Gilbertese language is &quot;down of the mast&quot;, alluding to the sail-shape of the atoll 

South Tarawa hosts the capital of the Republic of Kiribati and was also the central headquarters of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands since 1895. The House of Assembly is in Ambo, and the State House is in Bairiki. The offices of the various ministries of the government range from Betio at the south-west extreme to Nawerewere (on an easterly island in its chain), close to Bonriki (International Airport) and Temwaiku. Settlements on North Tarawa include Buariki, Abaokoro, Marenanuka and Taborio.

===Diplomatic missions===
Four resident diplomatic missions exist: the embassies of China (closed in 2003, re-opened in 2020) and Japan (opened in 2023), and the high commissions of Australia and New Zealand. The United Nations are also present in Kiribati, including UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, UNOPS, UN Women, WHO and FAO.

==History==
In Kiribati mythology, Tarawa represents the primordial earth, existing before Nareau the spider separated the land, ocean, and sky. After naming the sky &quot;karawa&quot; and the ocean &quot;marawa,&quot; Nareau referred to the rock upon which Riiki—another deity discovered by Nareau—stood when he raised the sky as &quot;Tarawa.&quot; Following this, Nareau went on to create the remaining islands of Kiribati, as well as Samoa.

Gilbertese first settled these islands thousands of years ago, and there have been migrations to and from Gilbert Islands since antiquity.

Evidence from a range of sources, including carbon dating and DNA analyses, confirms that the exploration of the Pacific included settlement of the Gilbert Islands by around 200 BC. The people of Tungaru (native name of the Gilbertese) are still excellent seafarers, capable of making ocean crossings in locally made vessels using traditional navigation techniques.

Thomas Gilbert, captain of the East India Company vessel , was the first European to describe Tarawa, arriving on 20 June 1788. He did not land. He named it Matthew Island, after the owner of his ship &quot;Charlotte&quot;. He named the lagoon Charlotte Bay. Gilbert&#x27;s 1788 sketches survive.
In 1841, the island was mapped by the US Exploring Expedition.

For nine generations, the island was divided between two warring factions, the House of Auatubu and the House of Teabike, until in 1892 HMS Royalist (1883) arrived, with Captain Edward Davis proclaiming that the island was now a British Protectorate. This saved Auatubu from massacre; the day before, they had been badly defeated by Teabike. A very old lady, plaiting a sleeping mat twenty-five years later, described the situation: 

&quot;In those days death was on the right hand and on the left. If we wandered north, we were killed or raped. If we wandered south, we were killed or raped. If we returned alive from walking abroad, our husbands themselves killed us, for they said that we had gone forth seeking to be raped. That was indeed just, for a woman who disobeys her husband is a woman of no account, and it matters not how she dies. Yet how beautiful is life in our villages, now that there is no killing and war is no more... Behold my son and my grandson! These would have died with me that day at Nea if the warship had not arrived. And these&quot;-she pointed out her great and great-great-grandchildren-&quot;would never have been born. We live because the Government of Kuini Kabitoria brought peace to us, and here I sit plaiting this mat to be buried in because of the kindness of that woman, with all my generations around me to wrap me in it when I die.&quot; 

The aftermath of land claims and counter-claims between Auatubu and Teabike nevertheless caused high tension for years afterwards.

Charles Richard Swayne, the first Resident Commissioner, decided to install the central headquarters of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands protectorate in Tarawa in 1895. Tarawa Post Office opened on 1 January 1911.

Sir Arthur Grimble was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa (1913–1919). He became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926.
During World War II, Tarawa was occupied by the Japanese, and beginning on 20 November 1943 it was the scene of the bloody Battle of Tarawa. On that day U.S. Marines landed on Tarawa and fought Japanese Marines of the Special Naval Landing Forces occupying entrenched positions on the atoll. The Marines captured the island after 76 hours of intense fighting that killed 6,000 people in total.

The fierce fighting was the subject of a documentary film produced by the Combat Photographers of the Second Marine Division entitled &quot;With the Marines at Tarawa&quot;. It was released in March 1944 at the insistence of President Roosevelt. It became the first time many Americans viewed American servicemen dead on film.. The US built bases on the Island.

The Kiribati Government began a road restoration project funded in part by the World Bank in 2014 to re-surface the main road from Betio in the west to Bonriki in the east, upgrading the main road that transits Tarawa from a dirt road. As of 2018, all that remained to be completed of this project was the sealing of the Japanese Causeway, connecting Bairiki and Betio, done in 2019.

<doc id="845642" wikidata="Q1381997" url="?curid=845642" title="Variable-length intake manifold">
<text>In internal combustion engines, a variable-length intake manifold (VLIM),variable intake manifold (VIM), or variable intake system (VIS) is an automobile internal combustion engine manifold technology. As the name implies, VLIM/VIM/VIS can vary the length of the intake tract in order to optimise power and torque across the range of engine speed operation, as well as to help provide better fuel efficiency. This effect is often achieved by having two separate intake ports, each controlled by a valve, that open two different manifolds – one with a short path that operates at full engine load, and another with a significantly longer path that operates at lower load. The first patent issued for a variable length intake manifold was published in 1958, US Patent US2835235 by Daimler Benz AG.

There are two main effects of variable intake geometry:
;Swirl: Variable geometry can create a beneficial air swirl pattern, or turbulence in the combustion chamber. The swirling helps distribute the fuel and form a air-fuel mixture. This aids the initiation of the combustion process, helps minimise engine knocking, and helps facilitate complete combustion. At low revolutions per minute (rpm), the speed of the airflow is increased by directing the air through a longer path with limited capacity (i.e., cross-sectional area) and this assists in improving low engine speed torque. At high rpm, the shorter and larger path opens when the load increases, so that a greater amount of air with least resistance can enter the chamber. This helps maximise &#x27;top-end&#x27; power. In double overhead camshaft (DOHC) designs, the air paths may sometimes be connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by de-activating the intake valve itself.
;Pressurisation: A tuned intake path can have a light pressurising effect similar to a low-pressure supercharger due to Helmholtz resonance. However, this effect occurs only over a narrow engine speed band. A variable intake can create two or more pressurized &quot;hot spots&quot;, increasing engine output. When the intake air speed is higher, the dynamic pressure pushing the air (and/or mixture) inside the engine is increased. The dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the inlet air speed, so by making the passage narrower or longer the speed/dynamic pressure is increased.

==Applications==
Many automobile manufacturers use similar technology with different names. Another common term for this technology is variable resonance induction system (VRIS).

<doc id="845648" wikidata="Q11680250" url="?curid=845648" title="Green beret">
<text>The green beret was the official headdress of the British Commandos, a special-forces unit active during World War II. It is still worn by members of the Royal Marines after passing the Commando Course, and personnel from other units of the Royal Navy, Army and RAF who serve within UK Commando Force and who have passed the All Arms Commando Course.

There are certain other military organizations that also wear the green beret because they have regimental or unit histories that have a connection with the British Commandos. These include the Australian, French and Dutch commandos. It is the norm in the armed forces of the Commonwealth Nations, where most regiments wear headdresses and cap badges which reflect regimental history and traditions.

==Origins==

Initially, those who joined the British Commandos kept their parent regimental headdress and cap badges. In 1941, No. 1 Commando had no fewer than 79 different cap badges and many different forms of headdress. &quot;Thus a motley collection of caps, Tam o&#x27; Shanters, bonnets, forage caps, caps &#x27;fore and aft&#x27;, berets, peaked KD caps, etc., appeared on the Commando parades,&quot; says Captain Oakley, &quot;the forest being a veritable RSM&#x27;s nightmare!&quot;

No. 2 Commando and No. 9 Commando faced with the same problem had adopted the Tam o&#x27; Shanter, but, as a traditional Scottish headdress, this was not considered suitable for what was a British unit. After some discussion it was agreed that if No. 1 Commando was to adopt a uniformed headdress then the beret, which had been worn by the Tank Regiment since the First World War (and had recently been adopted by the Parachute Regiment), would meet the requirements: it had no British regional affinity, it was difficult to wear improperly, and it could be easily stowed away without damage (when for example tin hats were in use).

Having decided on the headdress, the next question to be resolved was the colour. The shoulder insignia of No. 1 Commando had been designed by the Richmond Herald at the College of Arms. It incorporated three colours in its design of a green salamander going through fire: red, yellow and green. Green was chosen as the most suitable. A Scottish firm of tam-o-shanter makers in Irvine (Ayrshire) was chosen to design and manufacture the beret.

Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commandos formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them.

The proposal that the commandos should start wearing green beret as their official headdress was submitted to the Chief of Combined Operations and forwarded by Lord Mountbatten to the Under-Secretary of State for War. Approval was granted and in October 1942 the first green berets were issued to the Royal Marines.

==Australian Army==
Australian Commando berets are known as being &quot;Sherwood Green&quot; in colour. The corps badge on the beret is a black background and a gold combat dagger with the motto &quot;Foras Admonitio&quot; meaning &quot;Without Warning&quot; across the dagger. The green beret is only awarded to a soldier upon becoming qualified as a Commando in either of the below regiments. 
*1st Commando Regiment
*2nd Commando Regiment. Formerly 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, a special forces unit of the Australian Army
The Royal Australian Regiment also wears a &quot;Rifle Green&quot; Beret. The corps badge or &quot;Skippy Badge&quot; is a gold kangaroo and a wattle wreath with the motto &quot;Duty First&quot;.

* 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
* 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
* 5/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
* 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
* 8/9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment
==Belgian paracommandos==
Consisting of two battalions within the light brigade, only the 2nd Commando Battalion inherited the green beret along with other traditions from the 4th Troop of No.10 Commando. These paracommandos are the only &quot;green berets&quot; that are no longer a special operations force, but are considered to be elite. However, the Belgian special forces usually only recruits from paracommandos.
==Dutch commandos==
The Special Forces of the Netherlands consist mainly of the KCT (Korps Commando Troepen). Their motto is &quot;Nunc aut Nunquam&quot; which is Latin for &quot;Now or Never&quot;. The roots of the KCT go back to World War II. Under the name No. 2 (Dutch) Troop, the first Dutch commandos were trained in Achnacarry, Scotland, as part of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The unit was formed on March 22, 1942, the birthday of the present KCT.

Members of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps also receive upon completion of the Commando Course a green beret, but with the gold anchor on a red background.
==Finnish Coastal Jaegers==
The Finnish Coastal Jaegers primary role is to conduct counterattacks against enemy landings in the Finnish archipelago, an environment known for small islands and skerries. Jaegers can function independently or with the support of artillery units, including light or heavy mortars. A number of Coastal Jaeger troops receive training for unconventional warfare and reconnaissance behind enemy lines.
The right to wear the green beret must be earned &amp; can be lost as a punishment. 
==French Navy Commandos==
The Commandos Marine, nicknamed &quot;bérets verts&quot; (&quot;green berets&quot;), are the special operations forces unit of the French Navy. As the unit traces its origins back to the United Kingdom, with the first generation being made up of Free French volunteers trained alongside their British peers during the Second World War, the Commandos Marine wear the same green berets as the British Commandos, pulled to the right (a unique case in the French Armed Forces where berets are pulled to the left).
==French Foreign Legion==

The French Foreign Legion regiments also notably wear a green beret. Although this tradition, unlike the former, is not linked to the UK.
==Italian Navy&#x27;s Special Forces==
The COMSUBIN are the elite special operations unit of the Italian Navy. The Royal Italian Navy&#x27;s Naval Assault Divisions is considered to be the precursor of modern Naval Special Forces. They are called &quot;baschi verdi&quot; (green berets).
==Lithuanian military==
Green berets are worn by soldiers of most of the Lithuanian Armed Forces with exception of the Military Police, Navy, Air Force, the Volunteer Forces, SOF and the Engineer Battalion. In 1991 the need arose to distinguish between Iron Wolf brigade and other forces wearing black berets so their commander has chosen the green beret as a mark of special forces although later it became regular mechanized infantry.
==Mexican Army Special Forces Corps==
The Mexican Army Special Forces nicknamed the COIFE, formerly the GAFE (&quot;Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales&quot;), are a special operations unit of the Mexican Army. The COIFE adapted the green beret as their signature headgear, known as the &quot;boina verde&quot; (Spanish for green beret). The COIFE have received training from Israeli and American special forces. The COIFE have also played a key role against Mexican drug cartels during the on-going Mexican drug war. They are the Mexican Army&#x27;s equivalent to the U.S. Army Special Forces.
== Portuguese Paratroopers ==
The Portuguese Paratroopers (Portuguese: &quot;Tropas Paraquedistas&quot;) are an elite infantry assault force, representing the bulk of the airborne forces of Portugal. They were created in 1955 as part of the Portuguese Air Force, being transferred to the Portuguese Army in 1993. Presently, most of the Paratroopers are part of the Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade which also includes the Commandos and the Special Operations forces.

In 1955, the Paratroopers were the first unit of the Portuguese Armed Forces to adopt a beret. Instead of the red beret, traditionally worn by most of the parachute units of the other Western countries, the then Portuguese minister of Defense Santos Costa opted for a green beret, allegedly because green was the color of the ink of the pen he used to sign his decrees. Because of that, the Portuguese Paratroopers are nicknamed &quot;Boinas Verdes&quot; (&quot;Green Berets&quot;).
== Portuguese Special Operations (Army Rangers) ==

The unit members wear a moss/dry green beret and are the heir of the Special Hunters: the beret badge includes a hunting horn—a symbol of the Special Hunters; and the unit is known as Rangers because the first instructors of the Special Hunters completed the Ranger Course and adapted the characteristics of that training to the Special Operations Course. This special forces unit has operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, East-Timor, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
==Royal Marine Commandos==

In the United Kingdom all Royal Marines who have passed the Commando Course wear the green beret. Personnel from the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force volunteering for service with 3 Commando Brigade undertake the All Arms Commando Course, completion of which allows individuals to wear the headdress. Commando-qualified Royal Marines always wear the green beret, with the Globe and Laurel cap badge and commando-qualified personnel from other armed services wear the beret, with their own cap badge, when serving with commando units unless otherwise authorised. The Special Boat Service (SBS) also wear the green Commando beret but with their own cap badge consisting of a sword with two blue waved lines with the words &quot;by strength and guile&quot;

The Commando Badge of a Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife on a triangular patch/badge is worn on the sleeve in perpetuity by all those who have passed the course.
== Russia ==
There are several organizations in Russia using Green berets.

* Light green - used first by Soviet Border Troops of the KGB, and then by Russian Border Troops of the FSB. Is worn with a green Telnyashka. Beret has a distinct emerald colour.
* Green - used by Federal Bailiffs Service since 2011. The colour is bright green.
* Dark green - used in different reconnaissance troops of different branches of military and security. In particular used by reconnaissance troops of Rosgvadiya.

== Spanish Special Operations ==

Army (Special Operations Command), Navy (Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial, FGNS) and Air Force ( Escuadrón de Zapadores Paracaidistas, EZAPAC ) of Spain have their own special operations units, all wearing green berets with the unit badges.

Personnel attached to the MCOE (Mando Conjunto de Operaciones Especiales) (Joint Special Operations Command) wear a green beret with the badge of the joint three military branches. 
== Thailand ==

In Thailand, there are two units of green beret users:

* Khaki green – Territorial Defense Student of Royal Thai Army
* Green – Provincial Special Operation Sub-Division of Royal Thai Police. It is a SWAT-level special operations unit, armed with full weapons and more intensive tactical training than local police. It is the first unit to deal with threats in the area at the provincial police and provincial police region. If it exceeds its capabilities, it will request enforcement forces from a higher-level special operations unit, Naresuan 261 from Sub-Division 3, Border Patrol Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit.
==United States Army Special Forces==
 
In the U.S. armed forces, the green beret may be worn only by soldiers awarded the Special Forces Tab, signifying they have been qualified as Special Forces (SF) soldiers. The Special Forces beret is officially designated &quot;beret, man&#x27;s, wool, rifle green, army shade 297&quot;.

U.S. Special Forces wear the green beret as a distinction of excellence and uniqueness within the Army.

The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had many OSS World War II veterans in their ranks when it was formed in 1952. They began to unofficially wear a berets of varying colour while training. The color green became favored because it was reminiscent of the World War II British Commando-type beret. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) deployed to Bad Tölz, Germany in September 1953. The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group. Members of the 77th SFG began searching through their collections of berets and settled on the Rifle Green colour of the British Rifle Regiments (as opposed to the Lovat Green of the Commandos) from Captain Mike de la Pena&#x27;s collection. Captain Frank Dallas had the new beret designed and produced in small numbers for the members of the Special Forces.

Their new headdress was first worn at a retirement parade at Fort Bragg on 12 June 1955 for Major General Joseph P. Cleland, the now-former commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Onlookers thought that the commandos were a foreign delegation from NATO.

In 1956 General Paul D. Adams, the post commander at Fort Bragg, banned its wear, even though it was worn surreptitiously when deployed overseas. This was reversed on 25 September 1961 by &quot;Department of the Army Message 578636,&quot; which designated the green beret as the exclusive headdress of the Army Special Forces.

When visiting the Special Forces at Fort Bragg on 12 October 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked Brigadier General William P. Yarborough to make sure that the men under his command wore green berets for the visit. Later that day, Kennedy sent a memorandum which included the line: &quot;I am sure that the green beret will be a mark of distinction in the trying times ahead&quot;. By America&#x27;s entry into the Vietnam War, the green beret had become a symbol of excellence throughout the US Army. On April 11, 1962, in a White House memorandum to the United States Army, President Kennedy reiterated his view: &quot;The green beret is a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom&quot;. To no avail, both Yarborough and Edson Raff had previously petitioned the Pentagon to allow wearing of the green beret. The President, however, did not fail them.

In addition to being the headdress of the United States Army Special Forces, &quot;Green Berets&quot; is also a well known nickname of the organization.
Of historical note, an olive drab green beret was worn by arctic–qualified soldiers of the 172nd Infantry Brigade stationed in Alaska from 1973 to 1979 when the Department of the Army&#x27;s morale-enhancing order was in force and various colored berets began to be worn by numerous units and branches of the US Army.

<doc id="845660" wikidata="Q879290" url="?curid=845660" title="Verica">
<text>Verica (early 1st century AD) was a British client king of the Roman Empire in the years preceding the Claudian invasion of 43 AD.

From his coinage, he appears to have been king of the probably Belgic Atrebates tribe and a son of Commius. The distribution of his coins also shows that Verica&#x27;s kingdom was centred on modern Sussex and east Hampshire, and its capital would have been in or close to what became the Roman Noviomagus Reginorum (modern Chichester). He succeeded his elder brother Eppillus as king in about 15 AD, and may also have reigned over the northern Atrebatic kingdom at Calleva Atrebatum, today called Silchester. He was recognised as &quot;rex&quot; by Rome and appears to have had friendly trade and diplomatic links with the empire.

His territory was pressed from the east by the Catuvellauni, led by Epaticcus, brother of Cunobelinus, who conquered Calleva in about 25 AD. After Epaticcus&#x27;s death ca. 35 AD Verica regained some territory, but Cunobelinus&#x27;s son Caratacus took over and conquered the entire kingdom some time after 40 AD. According to Welcher, by 42AD when Verica was expelled, his kingdom had been reduced to a core area around Chichester and the Manhood peninsula, perhaps contained within the dykes of the Chichester entrenchments.

Dio Cassius records that &quot;Bericus&quot; (almost certainly Verica) was expelled from Britain around this time during a revolt. Suetonius refers to demands by the Britons that Rome return &quot;certain deserters&quot;. As &quot;rex&quot;, Verica was nominally an ally of Rome, so his exile gave Claudius an excuse to begin his invasion.

Verica&#x27;s relationship with Rome has been used to argue for the site of the Roman invasion of Britain as being along the south coast to assist him, rather than being at the traditional spot at Richborough in Kent. Verica&#x27;s southern Atrebatic kingdom of what is now Sussex and east Hampshire, had maintained a good relationship with Rome for many years. Verica is likely to have been seen by the Romans as an ally and a counter-balance to the powerful Catuvellaunian tribe to the north. This may have led to Roman military intervention to support Verica against the Catuvellauni who were becoming a threat to the Roman Empire&#x27;s north-west frontier. Unlike other nearby areas, the hillforts in the core of Verica&#x27;s kingdom show no sign of refortification and show the apparently pro-Roman attitude of the area&#x27;s inhabitants.

After the invasion, Verica may have been restored as king, but this is not attested in the historical or archaeological record. In any case a new ruler for the region, Cogidubnus, soon appeared. Cogidubnus may have been an heir of Verica who by this time would have been very old indeed.

<text>Weimar paramilitary groups were militarily organized units that were formed outside of the regular German Army following the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. The most prominent of them, the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, were combat units that were supported by the German government and used to suppress uprisings from both the Left and the Right. There were also Citizens&#x27; Defense () groups to maintain public order and paramilitary groups associated with specific political parties to protect and promote their interests.

Most who volunteered for the paramilitary groups came from the 6 million German soldiers who returned from the war to a country in the midst of the turmoil of the German revolution, which overthrew the Hohenzollern monarchy and established the Weimar Republic. The Freikorps especially took part in significant fighting in the Baltics, Silesia, Berlin during the Spartacist uprising and the Ruhr during the 1920 uprising there. The paramilitary groups as a whole contributed significantly to the remilitarization of Germany between the wars.

The Citizens&#x27; Defense groups were disbanded in 1920 and the &quot;Freikorps&quot; in 1921 because the government came to see them as threats and because of pressure from the Allies, who feared that the paramilitary groups were being used to circumvent the 100,000 man limit on the German Army imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The paramilitary groups connected with political parties lasted throughout the life of the Weimar Republic and in the case of the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), beyond its end.

== Freikorps ==

In the aftermath of World War I and during the German revolution of 1918–1919, units consisting largely of World War I veterans were raised as paramilitary militias. They were armed with the rifles they had returned with from the front; infantry and cavalry units also had machine guns and mortars. While exact numbers are difficult to determine, it is estimated that some 500,000 men were formal Freikorps members with another 1.5 million participating informally.

In the early days of the German revolution, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, the revolutionary government led by Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party, needed reliable troops in Berlin to protect its position. In consultation with the Army High Command (OHL), the Council reached an agreement to form the voluntary &quot;Freikorps&quot; units. Most of their members were anti-communist monarchists who saw no clear future in the revolutionary Germany that they had returned home to. They did not fight in support of the revolutionary government or the Weimar Republic after it was formed, but against its enemies from the political left, who they saw as Germany&#x27;s enemies.

&quot;Freikorps&quot; units suppressed the Marxist Spartacist uprising and were responsible for the extrajudicial executions of revolutionary communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919. The &quot;Freikorps&quot; also fought in the Baltic against Soviet Russia and were instrumental in putting down the Munich Soviet Republic, the Ruhr uprising and the Third Silesian uprising. The Kapp Putsch of March 1920, a failed attempt to overthrow the government of the Weimar Republic, drew its military support from the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, in particular the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt. It was after the failure of the Kapp Putsch, and under Allied pressure to keep both Germany&#x27;s official and unofficial military forces at the 100,000 man limit, that the &quot;Freikorps&quot; were officially disbanded in the spring of 1920. Some &quot;Freikorps&quot; members were then accepted into the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, Germany&#x27;s official army, but more joined the Nazi Stormtroopers (SA), illegal far right formations such as the Organisation Consul, or groups such as the Stahlhelm that were associated with political parties.

=== &quot;Freikorps&quot; units ===
For a list of major &quot;Freikorps&quot; units during the Weimar era, see &quot;Freikorps&quot; groups and divisions.

== Citizens&#x27; Defense ==
The Citizens&#x27; Defense paramilitary groups were voluntary, honorary associations based on part-time membership that performed self-protection tasks in local areas. They emerged in 1918 after the end of the First World War to ensure the maintenance of public order in cooperation with state authorities. After the Spartacist uprising in Berlin in January 1919, the Reichswehr Ministry instructed all general commands on 22 March 1919 to develop local militia groups into centrally controlled citizens&#x27; defense groups at the state level according to a uniform model. The newly created units were then to be directly subordinate to the Reichswehr leadership. In an emergency the citizens&#x27; defense forces were to serve as an army reserve.

Instead of becoming a pillar of support for the parliamentary system, some of the citizens&#x27; defense forces developed into anti-republican groups that were largely outside the control of the government and thus a threat to the Republic. As a result of the Allied disarmament requirements, the Citizens&#x27; Defense forces at Reich level were released from their military subordination and placed under the control of the individual state ministries. The Allies continued to regard them as a military reserve formation that was to be disbanded in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. After the failed Kapp Putsch, the Prussian minister of the Interior ordered the dissolution of the Citizens&#x27; Defense groups. His order was followed by the other states in the summer of 1920. Only Bavaria, where the groups had been most active, refused to disband its forces and kept them alive for another year.

==Groups affiliated with political parties==
=== Right-wing ===

* &quot;Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten&quot; (The Steel Helmet, League of Front-Line Soldiers), was officially a veterans&#x27; organization with about 500,000 members. Led by Franz Seldte and with ties at the leadership level to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, it was opposed to the Weimar Republic and politically close to the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) and other conservative groups. In 1931 it formed part of the Harzburg Front, an anti-democratic political alliance that included the Nazi Party. In 1934 it was integrated into the SA and dissolved in 1935.
* &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot; (German Nationalist Protection and Defiance Federation) was an antisemitic &quot;völkisch&quot; group led by Alfred Roth. Its membership peaked at about 200,000 when it was banned by the German government in 1922. It was notable for its revisionist propaganda regarding Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I and for attacking Jews, Social Democrats and middle-class supporters of the Republic.
* &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA; English &quot;Storm Division&quot;) was formed by Adolf Hitler in 1921, with most of its members coming from the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. As part of the Nazi Party, it protected its meetings, marched in its rallies and was often involved in street violence against members of the political left. Led by Ernst Röhm beginning in 1931, it had an estimated 2,000,000 members when Hitler became German chancellor.
* &quot;Kampfbund&quot; (Battle League) was a Bavarian umbrella group involving the SA, the Freikorps Oberland and the &quot;Bund Reichskriegsflagge&quot; (Imperial War Flag Society). It was created on 1 September 1923 to consolidate and streamline their agendas after the government in Berlin called off passive resistance to the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr. It planned and conducted the Beer Hall Putsch and disbanded after it failed.

=== Center to center-left ===
* &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot; (Reich Banner Black-Red-Gold) was devoted to the defense of the Weimar Republic. It was founded by former front-line soldiers of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (who made up the majority of the group), the German Democratic Party and the Catholic Centre Party. Organized militarily, its main opponents were the Nazi SA and the Communist Party of Germany&#x27;s &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot;. The &quot;Reichsbanner&quot; claimed more than three million members at its peak and was banned by the Nazis in 1933.
* &quot;Eiserne Front&quot; (Iron Front) brought together the &quot;Reichsbanner&quot;, free labor unions and workers&#x27; gymnastics and sports associations in 1931 in response to the far right&#x27;s Harzburg Front. Not itself organized as a paramilitary, the Iron Front&#x27;s central goal was to strengthen the Social Democrats in the 1932 Reichstag election.
* &quot;Jungdeutscher Orden&quot; (Young German Order) was a nationalist and antisemitic association founded by Artur Mahraun. Initially a paramilitary, it changed into a more politically oriented group with the goal of recreating the camaraderie experienced by soldiers at the front during World War I in order to overcome class and social differences in German society. In 1930, its political arm merged with the liberal German Democratic Party to form the short-lived German State Party. The Young German Order was banned by the Nazis in 1933.

=== Left-wing ===

* &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot; (Red Front Fighters&#x27; League) was founded by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1924 and attained a peak membership of 110,000. It was banned across Germany in 1929 after the &quot;Blutmai&quot; demonstrations in Berlin that left 33 dead. Despite the ban, it engaged in frequent street battles with the Nazi SA until Hitler came to power in 1933.
* &quot;Antifaschistische Junge Garde&quot; (Young Antifascist Guard) was the youth wing of the KPD and was banned in 1933.
* (Fighting League against Fascism) was the successor to the &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot; after it was banned in 1929. The &quot;Kampfbund&quot; itself was banned in 1933.
* &quot;Antifaschistische Aktion&quot; (Antifascist Action) was founded in 1932 and affiliated with the KPD. Its primary activity was to boost the KPD campaign during the July 1932 and November 1932 German federal elections. It was banned in 1933.
* Rote Ruhrarmee (Ruhr Red Army) was an army of approximately 50,000 workers that formed in the industrialized Ruhr district during the Kapp Putsch with the goal of establishing a council republic. Not a true paramilitary in structure, it was suppressed with considerable loss of life by government troops and &quot;Freikorps&quot; units in what was known as the Ruhr uprising (13 March – 12 April 1920).
* &quot;Schwarze Scharen&quot; (Black Band) were resistance groups of anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist youth affiliated with the Free Workers&#x27; Union of Germany (FAUD). The Black Band was banned in 1933.

Similar organisations existed in the First Austrian Republic, most notably the &quot;Schutzbund&quot; and the Heimwehr.

<text>Arvid Carlsson (25 January 1923 – 29 June 2018) was a Swedish neuropharmacologist who is best known for his work with the neurotransmitter dopamine and its effects in Parkinson&#x27;s disease. For his work on dopamine, Carlsson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000, together with Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard.

==Early life and education==
Carlsson was born on 25 January 1923 in Uppsala, Sweden, one of four siblings. His family moved to Lund after his father became a history professor at Lund University. Although his two older siblings followed their father&#x27;s career path, he instead chose to study medicine at Lund, beginning in 1941.

In 1944, he participated in the task of examining prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, whom Swedish aristocrat Folke Bernadotte had managed to bring to Sweden, which was neutral during World War II. He received his MD and PhD in pharmacology in 1951.

== Career ==
In 1951, Carlsson became an associate professor at Lund University. He spent five months as a research fellow for the pharmacologist Bernard Beryl Brodie at the National Heart Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, United States, and the change in his research focus to psychopharmacology eventually led to his Nobel Prize. In 1959 he became a professor at the University of Gothenburg.

In 1957 Katharine Montagu demonstrated the presence of dopamine in the human brain; later that same year Carlsson also demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain and not just a precursor for norepinephrine. Carlsson went on to develop a method for measuring the amount of dopamine in brain tissues. He found that dopamine levels in the basal ganglia, a brain area important for movement, were particularly high. He then showed that giving animals the drug reserpine caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control. These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. By administering to these animals L-Dopa, which is the precursor of dopamine, he could alleviate the symptoms. These findings led other doctors to try using L-Dopa in patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and it was found to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of the disease. L-Dopa is still the basis for most commonly used means of treating Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Carlson collaborated with the drug company Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) during the 1970s and the 1980s. He and his colleagues were able to derive the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), zimelidine, from brompheniramine. Zimelidine was later withdrawn from the market due to rare cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, but Carlson&#x27;s research paved the way for fluoxetine (Prozac), one of the most widely used prescription medicines in the world.

Carlsson was still an active researcher and speaker when he was over 90 years old and, together with his daughter Lena, he worked on OSU6162, a dopamine stabilizer which alleviates symptoms of post-stroke fatigue.

== Honours and awards ==
Carlsson&#x27;s research on the brain&#x27;s chemical signals and the resulting treatment for Parkinson&#x27;s disease earned him the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Paul Greengard and Eric R. Kandel. He won many other awards including Israel&#x27;s Wolf Prize in Medicine (1979), the Japan Prize (1994), and Italy&#x27;s Feltrinelli Prize (1999). He was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1975. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Southern California in 2007.

== Personal life ==
Carlsson married Ulla-Lisa Christoffersson in 1945 and they had three sons and two daughters. His daughter Maria was his lab manager and his daughter Lena was one of his collaborators.

He opposed the fluoridation of drinking water in Sweden. He was a vocal opponent of homeopathy and worked to prevent homeopathic preparations from being classified as medication in Sweden.

Carlsson died on 29 June 2018, at the age of 95.

<doc id="845665" wikidata="Q382068" url="?curid=845665" title="Sessue Hayakawa">
<text>, known professionally as , was a Japanese actor and a matinée idol. He was a popular star in Hollywood during the silent film era of the 1910s and early 1920s. Hayakawa was the first actor of Asian descent to achieve stardom as a leading man in the United States and Europe. His &quot;broodingly handsome&quot; good looks and typecasting as a sexually dominant villain made him a heartthrob among American women during a time of racial discrimination, and he became one of the first male sex symbols of Hollywood.

After withdrawing from the Japanese naval academy and attempting suicide at 18, Hayakawa attended the University of Chicago, where he studied political economics in accordance with his wealthy parents&#x27; wish that he become a banker. Upon graduating, he traveled to Los Angeles to board a scheduled ship back to Japan, but tried acting in Little Tokyo. Hayakawa impressed Hollywood figures and was signed to star in &quot;The Typhoon&quot; (1914). He made his breakthrough in &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1915), and became famous for his roles as a forbidden lover. Hayakawa was one of the highest paid stars of his time, earning $5,000 per week in 1915, and $2 million per year through his own production company from 1918 to 1921. Because of rising anti-Japanese sentiment and business difficulties, Hayakawa left Hollywood in 1922 and performed on Broadway and in Japan and Europe for many years before making his Hollywood comeback in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931).

Of his talkies, Hayakawa is probably best known for his role as Kuala, the pirate captain in &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960) and Colonel Saito in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Hayakawa starred in over 80 feature films, and three of his films (&quot;The Cheat&quot;, &quot;The Dragon Painter&quot;, and &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;) stand in the United States National Film Registry.

==Early life and career==

Hayakawa was born in the village of Nanaura, now part of a town called Chikura, in the city of Minamibōsō in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, on June 10, 1886. From a young age he yearned to go overseas and took on English studies in preparation. His father was the head of a fishermen&#x27;s union with some wealth. He had five siblings.

From an early age, Hayakawa&#x27;s family intended him to become an officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, while a student at the naval academy in Etajima, he swam to the bottom of a lagoon (he grew up in a shellfish diving community) on a dare and ruptured his eardrum. The injury caused him to fail the navy physical. His father felt shame and embarrassment by his son&#x27;s failure and this drove a wedge between them. The strained relationship drove the 18-year-old Hayakawa to attempt (ritual suicide). One evening, Hayakawa entered a shed on his parents&#x27; property and prepared the venue. He put his dog outside and attempted to uphold his family&#x27;s samurai tradition by stabbing himself more than 30 times in the abdomen. The barking dog brought Hayakawa&#x27;s parents to the scene and his father used an axe to break down the door, saving his life.

After he recovered from the suicide attempt, Hayakawa moved to the United States and began to study political economics at the University of Chicago to fulfill his family&#x27;s new wish that he become a banker. While a student, he reportedly played quarterback for the football team and was once penalized for using jujitsu to bring down an opponent. Hayakawa graduated from the University of Chicago in 1912, and subsequently made plans to return to Japan. Hayakawa traveled to Los Angeles and awaited a transpacific steamship. During his stay, he discovered the Japanese Theatre in Little Tokyo and became fascinated with acting and performing plays.

The above account, however, is disputed, in part or in whole. According to professor of Japanese language and literature at UC San Diego Daisuke Miyao, Hayakawa&#x27;s turn to acting was in reality less eventful; there is no record of Hayakawa having attended University of Chicago or having played sports there. Hayakawa&#x27;s acting career instead likely followed a series of odd jobs in California: as a dishwasher, waiter, ice cream vendor, and factory worker; his theatrical appearances also were just another temporary pursuit.

Another revisionist account by author Orie Nakagawa holds that Hayakawa had always intended to go to California to find work under his older brother in San Francisco; his father, however, convinced him to study at Chicago instead, and Hayakawa did so for a year before leaving to return to his original pursuits.

It was around this time that Hayakawa first assumed the stage name , meaning &quot;snowy continent&quot; ( means &quot;snow&quot; and means &quot;continent&quot;). One of the productions in which Hayakawa performed was called &quot;The Typhoon&quot;. Tsuru Aoki, a member of the acting troupe, was so impressed with Hayakawa&#x27;s abilities and enthusiasm that she enticed film producer Thomas H. Ince to see the play. Ince saw the production and offered to turn it into a silent film with the original cast. Eager to return to Japan, Hayakawa tried to dissuade Ince by requesting the astronomic fee of $500 a week, but Ince agreed to his request.

&quot;The Typhoon&quot; (1914) became an instant hit and was followed by two additional pictures produced by Ince, &quot;The Wrath of the Gods&quot; (1914) co-starring Hayakawa&#x27;s new wife, Aoki, and &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; (1914). With Hayakawa&#x27;s rising stardom, Jesse L. Lasky soon offered Hayakawa a contract, which he accepted, making him part of Famous Players–Lasky (now Paramount Pictures).

==Stardom==

Hayakawa&#x27;s second film for Famous Players–Lasky was &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1915), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. &quot;The Cheat&quot; co-starred Fannie Ward as Hayakawa&#x27;s love interest and was a huge success, making Hayakawa a romantic idol and sex symbol to the female movie-going public. &quot;It caused a sensation,&quot; says Stephen Gong, the executive director of San Francisco&#x27;s Center for Asian American Media. &quot;The idea of the rape fantasy, forbidden fruit, all those taboos of race and sex—it made him a movie star. And his most rabid fan base was white women.&quot; With his popularity and &quot;broodingly handsome&quot; good looks, Hayakawa commanded a salary that reached over $3,500 a week at the height of his fame in 1919. In 1917, he built his residence, a castle-styled mansion, at the corner of Franklin Avenue and Argyle Street in Hollywood, which was a local landmark until it was demolished in 1956.

Following &quot;The Cheat&quot;, Hayakawa became a leading man for romantic dramas in the 1910s and early 1920s. He also began acting in Westerns and action films. He sought roles but, dissatisfied with being constantly typecast, Hayakawa decided to form his own production company. There is some lack of clarity on how Haworth Pictures Corporation got its original funding. Hayakawa himself gave two different versions. The first was in his autobiography; he tells of William Joseph Connery, a fellow University of Chicago alumnus, introducing him to A.B.C. Dohrmann, the president of a china and glassware company in San Francisco who was willing to pay one million dollars to establish the company. In the second version, Connery&#x27;s parents were multimillionaire coal mine owners who provided the million dollars.

Over the next three years, Hayakawa produced 23 films and had earned $2 million by 1920, with which he was able to pay back the $1 million he had borrowed from Connery. Hayakawa produced, starred in, and contributed to the design, writing, editing, and directing of the films. Critics hailed Hayakawa&#x27;s understated, Zen-influenced acting style. Hayakawa sought to bring , or the &quot;absence of doing&quot;, to his performances, in direct contrast to the then-popular studied poses and broad gestures. In 1918, Hayakawa personally chose the American serials actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in a series of films, the first being the racial drama &quot;The City of Dim Faces&quot; (1918), followed by &quot;His Birthright&quot; (1918), which also starred Aoki. His collaboration with Sais ended with &quot;Bonds of Honor&quot; (1919). Hayakawa also appeared opposite Jane Novak in &quot;The Temple of Dusk&quot; (1918) and Aoki in &quot;The Dragon Painter&quot; (1919). According to Goldsea Hayakawa&#x27;s fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and John Barrymore. Hayakawa drove a gold plated Pierce-Arrow and entertained lavishly in his &quot;Castle&quot;, which was known as the scene of some of Hollywood&#x27;s wildest parties. Shortly before Prohibition took effect in 1920, he bought a large supply of liquor, leading him to joke that he owed his social success to his liquor supply. He took Aoki on a trip to Monaco where he gambled at the Monte Carlo Casino.

Hayakawa left Hollywood in 1922; different authors give various explanations such as prevailing anti-Japanese sentiment and business difficulties. Nakagawa focuses on three events in particular: first on the set of &quot;The Swamp&quot; (1921) his appendix ruptured and while he was at the hospital there was an attempt to usurp his insurance money, second there was a baseless tabloid report that Aoki had attempted suicide, and third Hayakawa believed there was an attempt on his life by the Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation, (accused of supporting anti-Japanese legislation,) for insurance money by the collapse of an unsafe earthquake sequence on the set of &quot;The Vermilion Pencil&quot;, leading to his suing the studio. He visited Japan with Aoki for the first time since he had come to the US. He returned soon afterwards, however and played the lead role in &quot;Tiger Lily&quot; on Broadway in 1923. The next decade and a half saw him also perform in Japan and Europe. In London, Hayakawa starred in &quot;The Great Prince Shan&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Story of Su&quot; (1924). In 1925, he wrote a novel, &quot;The Bandit Prince&quot;, and adapted it into a short play. In 1930, Hayakawa performed in &quot;Samurai&quot;, a one-act play written specifically for him, in front of Great Britain&#x27;s King George V and Queen Mary. Hayakawa became widely known in France, where audiences &quot;enthusiastically embraced&quot; him and made his French debut, &quot;La Bataille&quot; (1923) (also produced by Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation), a critical and financial success. German audiences found Hayakawa &quot;sensational&quot; and in Russia he was considered one of the &quot;wonderful actors&quot; of America. In addition to numerous Japanese films, Hayakawa also produced a Japanese-language stage version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. In the initial decades of his career, Hayakawa established himself as the first leading man of Asian descent in American and European cinema. He was also the first non-Caucasian actor to achieve international stardom.

==Later career==

Returning to the United States again in 1926 to appear on Broadway—and later in vaudeville—Hayakawa opened a Zen temple and study hall on New York&#x27;s Upper West Side. Hayakawa later transitioned into doing talkies; his return to Hollywood and sound film debut came in &quot;Daughter of the Dragon&quot; (1931), starring opposite Chinese American performer Anna May Wong. His accent did not go over well when sound was added to movies. Hayakawa played a samurai in the German-Japanese co-production &quot;The Daughter of the Samurai&quot; (1937). The same year, Hayakawa went to France to perform in &quot;Yoshiwara&quot; (1937), but was trapped in the country and separated from his family upon the German occupation of France in 1940. Hayakawa made few films in the following years, but supported himself financially by selling his watercolor paintings. He became friends with writer Jirōhachi Satsuma who was also trapped in France. Goldsea states that he joined the French Resistance and helped Allied flyers during World War II, although Hayakawa states that he mainly helped the local Japanese community during the war and after. His nomadic lifestyle continued until 1950.

In 1949, Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s production company located Hayakawa and offered him a role in &quot;Tokyo Joe.&quot; Before issuing a work permit, the American Consulate investigated Hayakawa&#x27;s activities during the war and found that he had in no way contributed to the German war effort. Hayakawa followed &quot;Tokyo Joe&quot; with &quot;Three Came Home&quot; (1950), in which he played real-life POW camp commander Lieutenant-Colonel Suga, before returning to France.

After the war, Hayakawa&#x27;s on-screen roles can best be described as &quot;the honorable villain&quot;, a figure exemplified by his portrayal of Colonel Saito in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe. He called the role the highlight of his career. After the film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting. Throughout the following years he performed guest appearances on a handful of television shows and films, making his final performance in the animated film &quot;The Daydreamer&quot; (1966).

After retiring, Hayakawa dedicated himself to Zen Buddhism, became an ordained Zen master, worked as a private acting coach, and wrote his autobiography &quot;Zen Showed Me the Way&quot;.

==Racial barriers==
Throughout Hayakawa&#x27;s career, many segments of American society were filled with feelings of anti-Japanese sentiment, partly from nationalism rising from World War I and World War II. Hayakawa was constantly typecast as a villain or forbidden lover and was unable to play parts that would be given to white actors such as Douglas Fairbanks. Hayakawa stated, &quot;Such roles [in &quot;The Wrath of the Gods&quot;, &quot;The Typhoon&quot;, and &quot;The Cheat&quot;] are not true to our Japanese nature... They are false and give people a wrong idea of us. I wish to make a characterization which shall reveal us as we really are.&quot; In 1949, he lamented, &quot;My one ambition is to play a hero&quot;. Hayakawa&#x27;s dilemma was analogous to that of Rudolph Valentino, nine years his junior; both were foreign born, and were typecast as exotic or forbidden lovers. Although Hayakawa&#x27;s contract with Famous Players expired in May 1918, the studio still asked him to star in &quot;The Sheik&quot;. Hayakawa refused in order to start his own company. With influence from June Mathis, the role went to the barely known Valentino, turning him into a screen icon overnight.

Writing to the &quot;What the Picture Did for Me&quot; section of the &quot;Exhibitors Herald&quot; in March 1922, a theater owner in Denison, Iowa, with a population of about 3,500, revealed the mixed feelings about Hayakawa in middle America (and the language used to describe him): &quot;The Jap is sure a good actor, but some people don&#x27;t seem to like him.&quot; In 1930, the Production Code came into effect (enforced after 1934) which forbade portrayals of miscegenation in film. This meant that unless Hayakawa&#x27;s co-star was an Asian actress, he would not be able to portray a romance with her. Hayakawa was placed in this awkward position due to his ethnicity. Naturalization laws at that time prevented him from becoming a U.S. citizen and because of anti-miscegenation laws, he could not marry someone of another race.

Hayakawa&#x27;s early films were not popular in Japan because many felt that his roles portrayed Japanese men as sadistic and cruel. Many Japanese viewers found this portrayal insulting. Nationalistic groups in particular were censorious. Some Japanese believed that Hayakawa was contributing to increased anti-Japanese sentiment in the U.S., and regarded him as a traitor to the Japanese people. After Hayakawa established himself as an American superstar, the negative tone in the press that regarded him as a national and racial shame lessened by a noticeable degree, and Japanese media started publicizing Hayakawa&#x27;s cinematic achievements instead. His later films were also not popular, because he was seen as &quot;too Americanized&quot; during a time of nationalism.

==Personal life==

On May 1, 1914, Hayakawa married fellow performer Tsuru Aoki, who co-starred in several of his films. Hayakawa had an affair with a white actress, Ruth Noble, a fellow vaudeville performer who had co-starred with him in &quot;The Bandit Prince.&quot; Noble gave birth to a son, Alexander Hayes, but gave Hayakawa custody of the child. Sessue and Aoki adopted him, changing his name to Yukio, and they raised and educated him in Japan. Later, they adopted two more daughters: Yoshiko, an actress, and Fujiko, a dancer. Aoki died in 1961.

Physically, Hayakawa possessed &quot;an athlete&#x27;s physique and agility&quot;. A 1917 profile on Hayakawa stated that he &quot;is proficient in jiu-jitsu, an expert fencer, and can swim like a fish. He is a good horseman and plays a fast tennis racket. He is tall for a Japanese, being in height in height, and weighs .&quot;

Hayakawa was known for his discipline and martial arts skills. While filming &quot;The Jaguar&#x27;s Claws&quot;, in the Mojave Desert, Hayakawa played a Mexican bandit, with 500 cowboys as extras. On the first night of filming, the extras drank all night and well into the next day. No work was being done, so Hayakawa challenged the group to a fight. Two men stepped forward. Hayakawa said, &quot;The first one struck out at me. I seized his arm and sent him flying on his face along the rough ground. The second attempted to grapple and I was forced to flip him over my head and let him fall on his neck. The fall knocked him unconscious.&quot; Hayakawa then disarmed yet another cowboy. The extras returned to work, amused by the way the small man manhandled the big bruising cowboys.

==Death and legacy==
Hayakawa retired from film in 1966. He died in Tokyo on November 23, 1973, from a cerebral thrombosis, complicated by pneumonia. He was buried in the Chokeiji Temple Cemetery in Toyama, Japan.

Many of Hayakawa&#x27;s films are lost. Most of his later works, including &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;The Geisha Boy&quot;, &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Joe&quot;, and &quot;Three Came Home&quot; are available on DVD. In 1960, Hayakawa was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street, in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California for his contributions to the motion picture industry.

A musical based on Hayakawa&#x27;s life, &quot;Sessue&quot;, was performed in Tokyo in 1989. In September 2007, the Museum of Modern Art hosted a retrospective on Hayakawa&#x27;s work entitled: &quot;Sessue Hayakawa: East and West, When the Twain Met&quot;. Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima planned to create a biopic entitled &quot;Hollywood Zen&quot; based on Hayakawa&#x27;s life. The script was allegedly completed and set to film in Los Angeles, but due to constant delays and the death of Oshima in 2013, the project has yet to be filmed.

In 2020, Hayakawa&#x27;s life story was told as part of PBS&#x27;s documentary &quot;Asian Americans.&quot;

His legacy is lasting, especially in the Asian-American community. Media professor Karla Rae Fuller wrote in 2010: &quot;What is even more remarkable about Hayakawa&#x27;s precedent-setting career in Hollywood as an Asian American is the fact that he is virtually ignored in film history as well as star studies.[...] Furthermore, the fact that he reached such a rare level of success whereby he could form and run his own production company makes his omission from the narrative of Hollywood history even more egregious.&quot;

<text>George Mortimer Bibb (October 30, 1776 – April 14, 1859) was an American lawyer and politician and the seventeenth United States Secretary of the Treasury. He was chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals and twice represented Kentucky as a senator in Congress, serving from 1811 to 1814 and from 1829 to 1835.

==Biography==
Bibb was born in Prince Edward County, Virginia, graduated from Hampden–Sydney College in 1791, and later graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary, then studied law. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Virginia and Lexington, Kentucky. After making a permanent move to Kentucky, Bibb was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1806, 1810, and again in 1817. He was appointed a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1808 and then chief justice through 1810.

While a wealthy man, he claimed to have faced significant financial difficulties from losses in the Panic of 1837.

Following the death of his father, the Reverend Richard Bibb Sr., George Bibb advised his brother on how to carry out his father&#x27;s instructions in his will to emancipate his slaves. George Bibb did so despite his personal pro-slavery views.

However, he did not emancipate his own slaves, believing that free blacks were &quot;a nuisance to society.&quot; At the time of Bib&#x27;s death, his body servant Willis was auctioned in Washington DC, near the White House.

==Career==
In 1811 he was elected to the United States Senate from Kentucky and served until 1814 when he again returned to Lexington to work as a lawyer. He moved to Frankfort, Kentucky in 1816 and sided with the New Court faction in the Old Court-New Court controversy in the 1820s. He was again named Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1827, serving for a year.
He was re-elected to the United States Senate in 1829 and served as a Jacksonian Democrat through 1835. During the 21st Congress he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Post Office and Post Roads. While in the Senate, he was a strong advocate for pro-slavery views. In 1834, he was the sole Democratic member of the Senate to vote in support of the censure of President Andrew Jackson.

He was chancellor of the Louisville Chancery Court from 1835 through 1844 and in 1844 became President John Tyler&#x27;s fourth United States Secretary of the Treasury serving through 1845.

He was in his late sixties when he assumed his Treasury position, dressing &quot;in antique style, with kneebreeches.&quot; Bibb&#x27;s &quot;Annual Report on the State of the Finances&quot; for 1844 consisted of an elaborate compilation of statistics detailing the financial history of the nation since 1789. In addition, he presented a solid argument for the establishment of a &quot;sinking fund,&quot; accumulated through regular deposits and used to pay the interest and principal on the national debt. Bibb advocated using Treasury surplus revenue from customs and internal revenue collection to supply the sinking fund. Such a fund had been used effectively to reduce the deficit from 1789 to 1835, but Bibb was unable to revive it.

After this he was a lawyer in Washington, D.C., and an assistant in the U.S. Attorney General&#x27;s office.

He was an active Freemason. He was the first master of Russellville Lodge No. 17, Russellville, Kentucky and was master of Hiram Lodge No. 4, in Frankfort. He was also past master of Lexington Lodge No. 1 at Lexington, and served as secretary in 1804. In 1804 he was grand master of Kentucky.

He died in Georgetown, D.C., in 1859, and is buried in Frankfort Cemetery with a cenotaph at the Congressional Cemetery.

<text>Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) is a rocket launch site on Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, United States, just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and approximately north-northeast of Norfolk. The facility is operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and primarily serves to support science and exploration missions for NASA and other federal agencies. WFF includes an extensively instrumented range to support launches of more than a dozen types of sounding rockets; small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets; high-altitude balloon flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research; and, using its Research Airport, flight tests of aeronautical research aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles.

There have been over 16,000 launches from the rocket testing range at Wallops since its founding in 1945 in the quest for information on the flight characteristics of airplanes, launch vehicles, and spacecraft, and to increase the knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and the environment of outer space. The launch vehicles vary in size and power from the small Super Loki meteorological rockets to orbital-class vehicles.

The Wallops Flight Facility also supports science missions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and occasionally for foreign governments and commercial organizations. Wallops also supports development tests and exercises involving United States Navy aircraft and ship-based electronics and weapon systems in the Virginia Capes operating area, near the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to its fixed-location instrumentation assets, the WFF range includes mobile radar, telemetry receivers, and command transmitters that can be transported by cargo planes to locations around the world, in order to establish a temporary range where no other instrumentation exists, to ensure safety, and to collect data in order to enable and support suborbital rocket launches from remote sites.

The WFF mobile range assets have been used to support rocket launches from locations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and at sea. Workers at Wallops include approximately 1,000 full-time NASA civil service employees and the employees of contractors, about 30 U.S. Navy personnel, and about 100 employees of NOAA.

== History ==

In 1945, NASA&#x27;s predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), established a rocket launch site on Wallops Island under the direction of the Langley Research Center. This site was designated the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station and conducted high-speed aerodynamic research to supplement wind tunnel and laboratory investigations into the problems of flight. In 1958, Congress established NASA, which absorbed Langley Research Center and other NACA field centers and research facilities. At that time, the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station became a separate facility, Wallops Station, operating directly under NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In 1959, NASA acquired the former Naval Air Station Chincoteague, and engineering and administrative activities were moved to this location. In 1974, the Wallops Station was named Wallops Flight Center. The name was changed to Wallops Flight Facility in 1981, when it became part of Goddard Space Flight Center.

In the early years, research at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury capsules were tested at Wallops in support of NASA&#x27;s crewed space flight program - the Mercury program - before astronauts were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Some of these tests using the Little Joe booster rocket were designed to flight-qualify components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems and some of the life support systems. Two rhesus monkeys, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.

The first payload launched into orbit from Wallops Island was Explorer IX, atop a Scout rocket, on February 15, 1961.

On September 6, 2013, the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) was launched from Wallops, atop a Minotaur V rocket. This was the first time that an American lunar mission had been launched from anywhere but Florida.

Wallops Island is currently experiencing beach erosion of 10 to 22 feet (3 to 7 meters) a year, due in part to the current sea level rise; some access roads and parking lots have had to be rebuilt several times over the past five years. NASA has responded by continually fortifying the shoreline with sand.

A permanent ground control station for NASA&#x27;s RQ-4 Global Hawk drone is at Wallops Flight Facility.

== Facilities ==
The WFF Main Base is located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on the Delmarva Peninsula about west of Chincoteague, Virginia; about north of Norfolk, Virginia, and southeast of Salisbury, Maryland. The WFF consists of three separate parcels of land totaling 6,200 acres (25 km²): the Main Base, the Mainland, and the Wallops Island Launch Site. The Mainland and the Wallops Island Launch Site are about southeast of the Main Base.

===Airspace===
Wallops operates controlled airspace with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) qualified air traffic controllers including:

*The WFF Airport Control Zone to within a radius of the airport
*Restricted Area R-6604 connecting WFF airspace and offshore warning areas.

===Fixed facilities===
Major Wallops facilities include FAA-certified runways; an experimental UAV runway; and crash, fire, and rescue services. WFF has facilities for the receipt, inspection, assembly, checkout and storage of rocket motors and other hazardous pyrotechnic devices. The Wallops Island Launch Site includes six launch pads, three blockhouses for launch control, and assembly buildings to support the preparation and launching of suborbital and orbital launch vehicles.

The Wallops Research Range includes ground-based and mobile systems, and a range control center. Its radar facilities and systems are used for tracking and surveillance. Telemetry facilities include a variety of antennas, receivers, and display instrumentation systems. Command uplink and optical tracking facilities are included as part of the range. The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight, and test operations.

The WFF Research Airport is located on the Main Base. There are three runways (from to long), two taxiways, three ramps, and one hazardous cargo loading area in active service. Two ramps adjoin the two active hangars, and a third ramp adjoins the Crash, Fire and Rescue building. The primary research runway has a test section with a variety of surface textures and materials for runway research projects.

Weather measurements and predictions are critical to all Research Airport operations, rocket and balloon launches, and in safely conducting hazardous operations on the ground. Wallops meteorological services provide measurements of upper atmospheric and magnetic phenomena to augment and enable the collection of scientific data by sensors aboard flight vehicles. The S-band Doppler radar system at Wallops, known as SPANDAR, is capable of automatic unambiguous tracking of targets up to 60,000 kilometers away. It can detect a single raindrop of 3 millimeters at a range of 10 kilometers and cloud water content as little as 1 gram per cubic meter. SPANDAR&#x27;s sensitivity with its dish antenna can detect small changes in the refractive index of air caused by sea breeze fronts, gust fronts, and various forms of clear air turbulence.

===Mobile systems===
The Wallops mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range to ensure safety and collect data to support the rocket customers in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of transportable systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. While Wallops Island is the prime location for range services, major sounding rocket campaigns have been supported at Poker Flat, Alaska; Andoya, Norway; and Kwajalein Island, Marshall Islands. The Wallops Mobile Instrumentation is integrated with NASA and Department of Defense networks and can be used to supplement established ranges in support of rocket launches.

==Range technology development==
Since 2001, engineers at NASA Wallops Flight Facility have been developing new range technologies, systems and approaches to improve the cost and responsiveness of launch and flight test activities, within the constraints of available funding and program schedules.

Specifically, NASA Wallops has been leading two range technology development projects: the Autonomous Flight Safety System (AFSS) and the Low Cost TDRSS Transceiver (LCT2).

AFSS is a project to develop an autonomous on-board system that could augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.

LCT2 is an effort to produce a relatively low-cost transceiver to allow launch vehicles to communicate through NASA&#x27;s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) after they have gone over the horizon from the launch site. LCT2 is being pursued as part of the Space Based Range Demonstration and Certification (SBRDC) program (formerly called Space Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS)) in cooperation with NASA Kennedy Space Center.

==Commercial spaceport==
In 1998, the Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority, later joined by Maryland, built the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops on land leased from NASA. In December 2006, the facility made its first launch.

==Visitor center==
The Wallops Visitor Center has a variety of hands-on exhibits and hosts weekly educational activities and programs to enable children to explore and learn about the technologies designed and used by NASA researchers and scientists. In addition, one Saturday each month, NASA invites model rocketry enthusiasts to launch their own rockets from the WFF rocket launch site. NASA personnel also participate, launching models of various rockets and explaining the spacecraft they carry in real life.

The schedule for sounding rocket launches from WFF is posted on its official Web site.

===Education===
For many years WFF was home to the NSIP Sub-SEM and SEM projects. NSIP stands for the NASA Student Involvement Project, the Sub-SEM project was to design one of four experiments that would be inserted into an ORION-II one-stage rocket and launched above 98 percent of the atmosphere, and experience over 30 Gs of centrifugal force, while SEM was to design an experiment that would be flown on a future Space Shuttle mission. Each project gave 16 students and four teachers (four students and one teacher from each high school) the opportunity to spend an almost all-expense-paid week at WFF. Normally the students and teachers stayed in the Mariner Motel, now a Holiday Inn, conducting experiments and learning about the facility. Following the presidential mandate and budget cuts the entire NSIP program, SEM and Sub-SEM included, was shut down.

==Accidents==
On April 2, 1957, a Lockheed P2V-6 Neptune exploded in midair after takeoff from what was then known as Naval Auxiliary Air Station Chincoteague. All eleven occupants of the aircraft died.

On October 23, 1995, the maiden flight of a Conestoga 1620 rocket failed 46 seconds after liftoff, resulting in disintegration. EER Space Systems, Conestoga&#x27;s manufacturer, concluded that low frequency noise from an unknown source upset the guidance system on the rocket causing it to order course corrections when none were needed. The rocket went off course when its first stage steering mechanism ran out of hydraulic fluid and became inoperable. After this failure, the Conestoga program was terminated, and EER abandoned the launch business. At the time of the launch, the Conestoga was the largest rocket ever launched from Wallops Island, and it was the first orbital mission attempted from the facility since 1985. The company&#x27;s launch pad at Wallops Island were the first commercially built facilities in the US. 14 scientific experiments, some of which were planned to return from orbit, were destroyed. All debris landed in the Atlantic Ocean. There were no injuries.

On October 27, 1998, a Learjet 45 was destroyed at Wallops after a loss of control during a water ingestion test flight. Only minor injuries to a copilot and flight engineer were reported. There were no ground injuries. The airplane was being used to test a new nose wheel tire. For the test, the airplane was passed through a &quot;pool&quot; or &quot;trough&quot; of water on the runway at different speeds. The pilot failed to obtain/maintain alignment with the water pool and lost control. The plane departed the left side of the runway, and struck a pickup truck parked adjacent to the runway.

On August 22, 2008, an ALV X-1 sounding rocket was intentionally destroyed 20 seconds into flight after veering too far off course.
On October 28, 2014, a failure occurred in an Antares rocket, carrying Cygnus CRS Orb-3, shortly after launch and destroyed both the rocket and the payload at the adjacent Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Launch Pad 0A.

==Alliances==
The NASA Wallops Flight Facility has alliances with a number of organizations important to its mission and future growth. Some examples include:

*Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS)
*U.S. Navy Surface Combat Systems Center (SCSC)
*Navy Test and Training Ranges

<text>The Fortress of Solitude is a fictional fortress appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Superman. It is the place where Superman first learned about his true identity, heritage, and purpose on Earth. The fortress functions as a place of solace/occasional headquarters for Superman and is typically depicted as being in frozen tundra, away from civilization. Its predecessor, Superman&#x27;s &quot;Secret Citadel&quot;, first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #17, where it was said to be built into a mountain on the outskirts of Metropolis. By issue #58 (May–June 1949) it is referred to as the Fortress of Solitude, seems at a glance to be a freestanding castle, and is said to be located in a &quot;polar waste&quot;. When the Fortress reappears in 1958 and for the first time takes center stage in a story (&quot;The Super-Key to Fort Superman&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot; #241), it is again an underground complex in a mountainous cliffside.

Traditionally, the Fortress of Solitude is located in the Arctic, though more recent versions have been in other locations, including the Antarctic, the Andes, and Amazon rainforest. The general public is either unaware or at best only vaguely aware of the existence of the Fortress, and its location is kept secret from all but Superman&#x27;s closest friends and allies (such as Lois Lane and Batman). A trademark of the Fortress is that it contains a memorial statue of Jor-El and Lara, Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian parents, holding a large globe of Krypton. Although Superman has living quarters at the Fortress, his main residence is still Clark Kent&#x27;s apartment in Metropolis. The arctic Fortress of Solitude concept was first created for pulp hero Doc Savage during the 1930s.

== Original version ==

The concept and name &quot;Fortress of Solitude&quot; first appeared in the Doc Savage pulps in the 1930s and 1940s. Doc Savage built his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic and retreated to it alone to make new scientific or medical breakthroughs, and to store dangerous technology and other secrets. The Golden Age Superman did not have an arctic fortress, but instead a &quot;mountain sanctuary&quot; which was located in a mountain range on the outskirts of Metropolis. Here, Superman kept a diary, oversized tools for various projects, and other equipment and trophies.

Superman&#x27;s Silver Age Fortress, which debuted in 1958, was also located in the Arctic and served similar purposes. Built into the side of a steep cliff, the Fortress was accessible through a large gold-colored door with a giant keyhole, which required an enormous key to open it. The arrow-shaped key was so large that only Superman (or another Kryptonian such as Supergirl) could lift it; when not in use, the key sat on a perch outside of the Fortress, where it appeared to be an aircraft path marker. This was until a helicopter pilot followed the direction of the arrow straight to the entrance of the Fortress, forcing Superman to develop a cloak to camouflage the entrance and key (which now hung on brackets on its side beside the door) and to ensure the Fortress&#x27;s secrecy.

The Fortress contained an alien zoo, a giant steel diary in which Superman wrote his memoirs (using either his invulnerable finger, twin hand touch pads that record thoughts instantly, or heat vision to engrave entries into its pages), a chess-playing robot, specialized exercise equipment, a laboratory where Superman worked on various projects such as developing defenses to kryptonite, a room-sized computer, communications equipment, and rooms dedicated to all of his friends, including one for Clark Kent to fool visitors. As the stories continued, it was revealed that the Fortress was where Superman&#x27;s robot duplicates were stored. It also contained the Phantom Zone projector, various pieces of alien technology he had acquired on visits to other worlds, and, much like the Batcave, trophies of his past adventures. Indeed, the Batcave and Batman himself made an appearance in the first Fortress story. The Fortress also became the home of the bottle city of Kandor (until it was enlarged), and an apartment in the Fortress was set aside for Supergirl.

A detailed depiction of the Fortress and its contents forms the background to &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #26 (1981); &quot;Superman and his Incredible Fortress of Solitude&quot;, in which Superman minutely inspects the Fortress, suspecting an enemy has planted an Earth-destroying bomb within it. Another noteworthy appearance of this version of the Fortress was in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; Annual #11, a story by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons titled &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;, in which it served as a battleground for Superman, Batman, Robin, and Wonder Woman against the alien would-be overlord Mongul. This story was adapted to animation in the 2004 TV series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

In addition to Mongul, the Fortress has been independently broken into at various times by villains Lex Luthor and Brainiac (&quot;Action Comics&quot; #583 and &quot;Superman&quot; #423) and the Atomic Skull (&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #35), among others. According to &quot;Action Comics&quot; #261, Superman first established secret Fortresses in outer space and at the center of the Earth before settling on an Arctic location.

Additionally, Superman established an undersea Fortress of Solitude – hollowed out of the side of an undersea cliff – in September 1958. The undersea Fortress, which is reportedly located at the bottom of the Sargasso Sea at 28 degrees North latitude, 50 degrees West longitude, is stocked with numerous exotic ocean relics and is equipped with sophisticated monitoring apparatus to enable Superman to keep abreast of events occurring throughout the seven seas. Superman later abandoned the undersea Fortress and the structure is now used by the mer-people of Atlantis as a showplace and a tourist attraction.

The original version of the Fortress of Solitude made its last appearance in the 1986 non-canonical (or &quot;imaginary&quot;) story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;. In this story, under constant attacks by returning foes, Superman goes to ground inside the Fortress, taking his closest friends with him for their protection. The villainous android Brainiac soon besieges the Fortress with various allies, surrounding it and the outlying territory with an impenetrable force field to keep Superman&#x27;s fellow heroes from aiding him. Superman ultimately battles a newly evil Mister Mxyzptlk, who was behind the plot to destroy him. As Superman was forced to destroy Mxyzptlk, breaking his vow against killing, he exposes himself to gold kryptonite to permanently remove his powers and then appears to leave the Fortress to freeze to death in the Arctic cold. Superman is never seen again, although we find out in a &quot;ten years later&quot; wraparound segment set in 1997 that he survives as Jordan Elliot, husband of Lois Lane Elliot, and that they are the parents of toddler Jonathan Elliot, who has super-powers.

== Post-Crisis versions ==

In John Byrne&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Man of Steel&quot; miniseries, which re-wrote various aspects of the &quot;Superman&quot; mythos, the Clark Kent persona was described as a &quot;Fortress of Solitude&quot;, in that it allowed him to live as the ordinary person he saw himself as and leave the world-famous superhero behind. This concept was often invoked in later stories, and one story featured Superman hiding his secret identity from a telepath behind a door identical to that of the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Fortress. By that time, however, a more physical Fortress had been reintroduced.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #2 (1989), Superman, on a self-imposed exile to space, was entrusted with a Kryptonian artifact called the Eradicator, created by his ancestor Kem-El. Dedicated to preserving Krypton, this device built a new Fortress in the Antarctic as a precursor to recreating Krypton on Earth. Superman broke the Eradicator&#x27;s control, but maintained the Fortress as a useful location for emergencies. The first appearance of this new post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of the Fortress was in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #461 (December 1989).

It contained many artifacts from the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of Krypton, most notably a number of robot servitors (one of whom, Kelex, became a trusted confidant) and a battlesuit from the Third Age of Krypton.
This Fortress was cast into the Phantom Zone as a result of a battle between Superman, Lex Luthor, and Dominus, a villain who played with Superman&#x27;s mind and who was also trapped in the Phantom Zone. It did, however, serve as the template for the next Fortress, built by Steel, which was an extradimensional space accessed through a vast puzzle-globe. The now-mobile Fortress was relocated somewhere in the Andes.

In the &quot;DC One Million&quot; series (1998), Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude in the 853rd Century resides within a tesseract located at the center of Earth&#x27;s sun. By this time, Superman has lived in self-imposed exile within the Fortress for over 15,000 years.

During the &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; story arc in 2004–05 Superman comics, Wonder Woman breached the Fortress in an attempt to confront Superman, causing the Fortress to self-destruct. Superman subsequently established a new Fortress in an ancient temple on a remote village in the Cordillera del Cóndor Mountains, on the border of Ecuador and Peru. This version of the Fortress is visually similar to the earliest &quot;Secret Citadel&quot; from &quot;Superman&quot; #17.

The final version of the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Fortress was home to Krypto and his dog-sitter Ned (the last remaining Superman robot), and contained a version of Kandor, a portal to the Phantom Zone, Kryptonian and alien artifacts, and holographic images of Jor-El and Lara. The caretaker of the Fortress was Kelex, a Kryptonian robot that was a descendant of the Kelex robot that served Jor-El.

=== &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ===

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, several survivors of the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; multiverse – the Earth-Two Superman, Lois Lane of Earth-Two, Superboy-Prime, and Earth-Three&#x27;s Alexander Luthor, Jr. – set up a base in the ruins of the Antarctic Fortress following their escape from the dimension they had been trapped in since the end of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. It is revealed that Kal-L had a version of the Fortress of Solitude.

=== &quot;One Year Later&quot; ===
In the 2006 story arc &quot;&quot;, Superman recovered a piece of Kryptonian sunstone, which Lex Luthor had used to awaken an ancient Kryptonian warship. Superman learned that the sunstone had been sent with him from Krypton, and used it to construct a new Fortress in the Arctic in exactly the same manner as in the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film. He nevertheless plans to restore the Peruvian Fortress, even if compromised and no longer in a secret location, and plans more Fortresses around the world. This version of the Fortress physically resembles the movie and television depictions, and Superman communicates with Jor-El via crystal constructs as in the &quot;Superman&quot; film and &quot;Smallville&quot;.

=== The New 52 ===

In The New 52 reboot of DC&#x27;s continuity (launched in 2011) the Fortress of Solitude is first seen floating in space. It is later revealed to be the orbiting ship of Braniac which Superman had taken over after he physically reprogrammed the Collector of Worlds. This fortress is reported destroyed in the five years between the current &quot;Action Comics&quot; arc, and the New 52 present day, with the current fortress once more in the Arctic. In the New 52, Supergirl also has her own fortress, known as Sanctuary, and located in the depths of the ocean. This fortress first appears in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #12 with its purpose explained in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #13. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #15, Superman is revealed to have a fortress which he refers to as his &quot;Yucatan base&quot;, a reference to his fortress in the Amazon rain forest in previous continuity.

Following the discovery of Superman&#x27;s &quot;Super Flare&quot;, Kal-El made his way to the Fortress via a stolen motorcycle due to burning out his powers. When trying access the Fortress, the A.I. was unable to recognize Kal-El due to his DNA changing and forcibly removed his Kryptonian armor. It was revealed months later Vandal Savage was the person responsible for altering Superman&#x27;s DNA to draw Kal-El away from the Fortress. Savage later converged all of his forces on the Fortress itself and transported it to Metropolis. However, Superman was able to find a temporary &#x27;cure&#x27; for his power loss by exposing himself to kryptonite as a form of &#x27;chemotherapy&#x27; that burned away the radiation preventing his cells from absorbing energy. On the verge of death while trying to stop Savage, he is caught by the arm and shot in the lower abdomen. As he fell from the sky believing he was about to die, the kryptonite had finished burning away the radiation. The Fortress scanned Superman, confirmed that he is Kal-El, activated and opened up, caught Superman, restored his powers to their peak and returned his Kryptonian armor to him. After defeating Vandal Savage and his children, Superman moves the Fortress back to the arctic circle.

Several days after the crisis Superman uses the Fortress&#x27;s medical equipment and A.I technology to do a full physical on him and discovers that as a result of Vandal&#x27;s actions using Krytonite to burn out his infected cells that he is dying and has mere weeks to live.

Following Superman&#x27;s death, the Pre-New 52 Superman was able to gain access to the Fortress as both he and the deceased Superman share identical DNA, even though they are from separate timelines. Superman takes his deceased counterpart to the Fortress hoping to use the Regeneration Matrix to revive him, as the Eradicator did to him in his native timeline. In the New 52 universe of Prime Earth however, no such technology exists. After burying his counterpart in Smallville he returns to the Fortress and uses his heat vision to create a statue of Superman of Prime Earth to honor his fallen comrade.

The Eradicator of Pre-New 52 eventually arrives on Prime Earth and takes up residence within the Fortress.

== Other versions ==
=== &quot;All-Star Superman&quot; ===
In the out-of-continuity series &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;, the Fortress is once again located in the Arctic. Superman has replaced the giant key with a normal-sized key which is made from super-dense dwarf star material and weighs half a million tons, restricting its use to those with immense superhuman strength. It has a team of robots working on various projects. The Fortress itself contains the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, and a baby Sun-Eater, as well as larger-than-life memorabilia, similar to the objects found in the Batcave. It has various scientific facilities as well, including a time telescope that can receive brief cryptic messages with reception of limited quality from the future.

=== &quot;Earth One&quot; ===
In &quot;&quot; graphic novel series, the Fortress of Solitude was built by Superman&#x27;s Krytonian ship&#x27;s AI, using the Arctic&#x27;s cave system.

<doc id="845684" wikidata="Q767748" url="?curid=845684" title="Bloch MB.131">
<text>The Bloch MB.130 and its derivatives were a series of French monoplane reconnaissance-bombers developed during the 1930s. They saw some limited action at the beginning of World War II but were obsolete by that time and suffered badly against the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. After the fall of France, a few were pressed into &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service.

==Design and development==
The MB.130 was developed after the August 1933 French Aviation Ministry request for a reconnaissance and tactical bomber. It was an all-metal, twin-engine, low-wing monoplane with retractable landing gear, armed with three flexible machine guns, one each in the nose, dorsal turret, and ventral gondola. It first flew on 29 June 1934 and despite very ordinary performance, soon entered production, forty machines being ordered in October 1935. An improved version, the MB.131 was first flown on 16 August 1936 but still needed more work to overcome its deficiencies. The radically revised second prototype which flew on 5 May 1937 eventually formed the basis for series production, with aircraft being manufactured by SNCASO, the nationalised company that had absorbed Bloch and Blériot. Total production (including prototypes) was 143.

==MB.135==
A four-engined derivative of the MB.134, was developed powered by four Gnome-Rhône 14M 14-cylinder radial engines, with an essentially similar airframe. The sole example flew for the first time on 12 January 1939.

==Operational history==
Entering service in June 1938, the MB.131 went on to equip seven reconnaissance , six in metropolitan France and one in North Africa. Upon the outbreak of the war, the metropolitan suffered many losses in attempts at daylight reconnaissance of Germany&#x27;s western borders. They were subsequently restricted to flying night missions, though they still suffered many losses. By May 1940, all metropolitan units had been converted to Potez 63.11 aircraft, with only the African retaining them for front-line duty. After the Battle of France, the aircraft left in Vichy possession were relegated to target towing. Twenty-one unserviceable aeroplanes were reported captured by the but photographic evidence suggests at least a few flew for the Nazis.

<doc id="845687" wikidata="Q3572884" url="?curid=845687" title="Youppi!">
<text>Youppi! ( or , French for ) is the official mascot for the Montreal Canadiens, and former longtime mascot of the Montreal Expos. Youppi! wears an &quot;!&quot; instead of a jersey number.

==History==

Youppi!, a creation of Acme Mascots, Inc. (a division of Harrison/Erickson, Inc.), was commissioned by Montreal Expos vice-president Roger D. Landry. Originally leased by the baseball team in 1979, the mascot was eventually purchased by the Expos and represented them until they moved to Washington, D.C., after the 2004 season. With instructions from Landry and Rodger Brulotte, Youppi! was designed by Bonnie Erickson, formerly a designer for Jim Henson, and the designer of Miss Piggy, Statler and Waldorf and other Muppet characters. Its orange color was chosen as a reference to Rusty Staub, a former player for the Expos. The orange, hairy giant was a popular figure at Olympic Stadium prior to the Expos&#x27; relocation to Washington, D.C.

===Notoriety===
Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game. During the 1989 Expos season, on August 23 while atop the visitors&#x27; dugout in the 11th inning, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected by Bob Davidson, though he later returned, confined to the home team&#x27;s dugout roof, as Montreal eventually lost 1–0 in 22 innings. Youppi! was also a frequent joke punchline of notoriously sarcastic Atlanta Braves broadcaster Skip Caray. Youppi! was also referenced by pitcher Bill Lee during interviews in Ken Burns&#x27;s &quot;Baseball&quot; documentary.

Youppi! is one of only three mascots featured as displays at the Baseball Hall of Fame. The others are the Phillie Phanatic of Philadelphia, another design by Erickson, and the Famous Chicken from San Diego.

The Montreal-based political cartoonist Terry Mosher, better known as &quot;Aislin&quot;, depicted or referenced Youppi! on several occasions, including a prescient 1988 cartoon drawn at a time when the Expos were having a poor season and depicting then-general manager of the Canadiens Serge Savard receiving a phone call from Youppi!, presumably seeking employment.

Youppi! was voted to the Mascot Hall of Fame in December 2019, and was inducted in June 2020. Youppi! is the first mascot of a Canadian team to receive the honor.

===From baseball to hockey===
After the Expos moved to Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Nationals, the Nationals initially stated that Youppi! would still be a part of the team in some capacity. However, the team adopted a new mascot, the eagle &quot;Screech&quot;. For months after the move, the fate of Youppi! hung in the balance. Negotiations were held with ten groups, including the Montreal Alouettes.

On September 16, 2005, the Montreal Canadiens announced that Youppi! would become the first official mascot of the organization, and the first mascot to ever switch between any two major sports leagues in North America. Prior to Youppi!, the Canadiens had no mascot. The terms of acquisition were reportedly in the six figures. Youppi! now sports the Canadiens&#x27; &quot;bleu-blanc-rouge&quot; (blue, white, and red) jersey. Youppi!&#x27;s first game in the Bell Centre was on October 18, 2005.

On February 19, 2012, at the Canadiens&#x27; first home game after the death of Montreal Expos great Gary Carter, Youppi! wore the Expos colours in Carter&#x27;s memory.

On May 16, 2014, on the eve of the Canadiens series against the New York Rangers in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals, New York City native Jimmy Fallon, the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, which is taped in New York, made a bet with the Montreal Canadiens that if they won the series, Fallon would wear a Montreal jersey during his opening monologue. However, if the Rangers won the series, Youppi! would have to wear a Rangers jersey around Montreal and post at least ten pictures of him doing so on the Canadiens&#x27; Twitter account and also change their avatar to a pic of Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist playing guitar. The Rangers won the series on May 29 in six games. As such, on June 1, the Canadiens honoured their bet and a dejected Youppi! was photographed around Montreal in a Rangers jersey with Fallon&#x27;s name on the back, and the last photo, as Fallon stated, featured him riding the mechanical bull at Montreal bar Chez Serge.

===METAL!===
In 2022, to promote the team&#x27;s reverse retro jerseys, the team created METAL!, a heavy-metal-obsessed blue creature, who claims to have been Youppi!&#x27;s &quot;twin brother&quot;, and have been the Canadiens mascot from 1979 to 1993, even though there is no evidence of the latter statement. According to the Habs&#x27; announcement, METAL! seemed to have fallen asleep in an ice machine in the Montreal Forum basement after a party celebrating the Stanley Cup win in 1993, and only emerged in the summer of 2022, when the thing was unearthed during renovations.

METAL! was retired ahead of the 2024–25 NHL season.

== The Men Who Were &quot;Youppi!&quot; ==
In the 26 seasons that Youppi! was working with the Expos, only 5 men portrayed the mascot: Denis Desaulniers, Jean-Claude Tremblay, Claude Hubert, Jean-Simon Bibeau and Sylvain Ouellette.

=== Denis Desaulniers (1979–1983) ===
Denis Desaulniers was the first to wear the costume following the shift from Souki to Youppi!. Inspired by the popularity and irreverence of the San Diego Chicken, Desaulniers auditioned for and received the part at 25 years old. During his career as Youppi!, Desaulniers strived to create a warm soul and fun-loving attitude for the character.

Desaulniers also introduced one of Youppi&#x27;s most iconic moves: punching himself in the nose. He claims this was to stay in character while adjusting the head of the costume so he could see. Underneath the head of the mascot, he wore a motorcycle helmet with a thick layer of styrofoam to protect his head, which would cause the mascot&#x27;s head to fall forward frequently.

=== Jean-Claude Tremblay (1983–1985) ===
Jean-Claude Tremblay had his first interaction with the Expos after being hired to fix the mascot&#x27;s costume. At the time, Tremblay was doing corporate mascot gigs to make ends meet while working full-time at his brother&#x27;s art shop. Once the Expos&#x27; team discovered Tremblay&#x27;s talents as a mascot, he was offered the opportunity to succeed Desaulniers.

Tremblay was responsible for many changes to Youppi!&#x27;s costume, including more securely-attached eyes and a swap from the scruffy old material to washable parts following complaints (including his own) of the mascot&#x27;s smell.

After 3 seasons, Tremblay surrendered his role as Youppi! to focus on his real passion: creating mascots. As of 2023, he is one of the most prominent mascot manufacturers in North America, credited with creating mascots such as the Tampa Bay Ray&#x27;s Raymond and the Indianapolis Colt&#x27;s Blue.

=== Claude Hubert (1985–1991) ===
Claude Hubert was involved with mascots for around 20 years; he worked for many Canadian sports teams, such as the Montreal Dragons and the Montreal Machine.

As Youppi!, Hubert was responsible for the first and only incident wherein a mascot was expelled from a Major League Baseball game. As Youppi!, Hubert hopped on top of the away team&#x27;s dugout during an Expos v. Dodgers game and, following continued antics, was confronted by Tommy Lasorda. (Hubert claims to have already known of Lasorda&#x27;s distaste for mascots following his infamous &quot;tussle&quot; with the Philly Phanatic.) After the scuffle began to escalate, Bob Davidson, the umpire during that game, made the decision to eject Youppi!, who was eventually readmitted following chants from the crowd and a promise to remain on the Expos&#x27; side of the field.

=== Jean-Simon Bibeau (1988–1990, 2003–present) ===
This was not Bibeau&#x27;s first experience with athletic recognition, as he was already holding a USA NCAA record for goals scored in a season while playing hockey with the Plattsburg Cardinals at this time.

By 1995, Bibeau directed all of Youppi!&#x27;s activities for the Expos, and would continue following Youppi!&#x27;s transition from baseball with the Expos to hockey with the Montreal Canadiens to the present day. Bibeau shared the full responsibilities of Youppi! with Hubert.

=== Sylvain Ouellette (1996–2003) ===
The last to portray Youppi! during his time as a baseball mascot, Sylvain Ouellette was previously working as an entertainer at nightclubs. While working in nightclubs, he met Vincent Guy Aubry, a DJ who often worked at the Olympic Stadium during Expos games. After hearing the Expos were looking for a mascot, Aubry mentioned Ouellette to his superior at the stadium. Although Ouellette was not a baseball fan at the time, his love and passion for entertaining landed him the job.

During the Expos&#x27; two seasons in Puerto Rico, Ouellette proved especially valuable due to his Spanish proficiency and experience with Latin dancing and culture.

<text>Kutch district, officially spelled Kachchh is a district of Gujarat state in western India, with its headquarters (capital) at Bhuj. Covering an area of 45,674 km2, it is the largest district of India. The area of Kutch is larger than the entire area of other Indian states like Haryana (44,212 km2) and Kerala (38,863 km2), as well as the country of Estonia (45,335 km2). The population of Kutch is about 2,092,371. It has 10 talukas, 939 villages and 6 municipalities. The Kutch district is home to the Kutchi people who speak the Kutchi language.

Kutch literally means something which intermittently becomes wet and dry; a large part of this district is known as Rann of Kutch which is shallow wetland which submerges in water during the rainy season and becomes dry during other seasons. The same word is also used in Sanskrit origin for a tortoise. The Rann is known for its marshy salt flats which become snow white after the shallow water dries up each season before the monsoon rains.

The district is also known for ecologically important Banni grasslands with their seasonal marshy wetlands which form the outer belt of the Rann of Kutch.

Kutch is surrounded by the Gulf of Kutch and the Arabian Sea to the south and west, while the northern and eastern parts are surrounded by the Great and Little Rann (seasonal wetlands) of Kutch. It is also next to the border with Pakistan, a neighbouring country of India. When there were not many dams built on its rivers, the Rann of Kutch remained wetlands for a large part of the year. Even today, the region remains wet for a significant part of year. The district had a population of 2,092,371 as of 2011 census, of which 30% were urban. Motor vehicles registered in Kutch district have a registration number starting with GJ-12. The district is well connected by road, rail and air. There are four airports in the district: Naliya, Anjar, Mundra, and Bhuj. Bhuj and Anjar are well connected with Mumbai airport. Being a border district, Kutch has both an army and an air force base.

== History ==
The history of Kutch can be traced back to prehistoric times. There are several sites related to the Indus valley civilization in the region, and it is mentioned in Hindu mythology. The region is also mentioned in Greek writings during the reign of Alexander the Great. For a time, it was ruled by Menander I of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which was then overthrown by Indo-Scythians. The region was later ruled by the Maurya Empire and Sakas. In the first century CE, it was under the Western Satraps, followed by the Gupta Empire. By the fifth century, the Maitraka dynasty of Valabhi took over from which its close association with the ruling clans of Gujarat started. 

Hieun Tsang refers to Kutch as &quot;Kiecha&quot; in his writings. In the seventh century, Kutch was being ruled by Charans, Kathis, and Chavdas. The Chavdas ruled the eastern and central parts by the seventh century, but Kutch came under the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty by the tenth century. After the fall of Chaulukya, the Vaghelas ruled the state. By the thirteenth century, the Vaghelas controlled the whole of Kutch and adopted a new dynastic identity, Jadeja.

For three centuries, Kutch was divided and ruled by three different branches of the Jadeja brothers. In the sixteenth century, Kutch was unified under one rule by Rao Khengarji I of these branches, and his direct descendants ruled for two centuries and had a good relationship with the Gujarat Sultanate and Mughals. One of his descendants, Rayadhan II, left three sons, of whom two died, and a third son, Pragmalji I took over the state and founded the current lineage of rulers at the start of the seventeenth century. The descendants of the other brothers founded states in Kathiawar. After turbulent periods and battles with the armies of Sindh, the state was stabilized in the middle of the eighteenth century by a council known as Bar Bhayat ni Jamat who placed Rao as a titular head and ruled independently. The state accepted the sovereignty of the British East India Company in 1819, when Kutch was defeated in battle. That same year, the state was devastated by an earthquake. The state stabilized and flourished in business under subsequent rulers.

Upon the independence of India in 1947, Kutch acceded unto the dominion of India and was constituted an independent commissionaire. It was made a state within the union of India in 1950. The state witnessed an earthquake in 1956. On 1 November 1956, Kutch State was merged with Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat as Kutch district. The district was affected by a tropical cyclone in 1998 and the earthquake in 2001. The state saw rapid industrialization and growth in tourism in subsequent years.

== Topography ==
Kutch District, at , is the largest district in India. The administrative headquarters is the city of Bhuj which is geographically in the center of the district. Gandhidham is the largest city and Financial centre of Kutch. Other main towns are Rapar, Nakhatrana, Anjar, Mandvi, Madhapar, Mundra and Bhachau. Kutch has 969 villages. Kala Dungar (Black Hill) is the highest point in Kutch at .

Kutch is virtually an island, as it is surrounded by the Arabian Sea in the west; the Gulf of Kutch in south and southeast and Rann of Kutch in north and northeast. The border with Pakistan lies along the northern edge of the Rann of Kutch, of the Sir Creek. The Kutch peninsula is an example of active fold and thrust tectonism. In Central Kutch there are four major east-west hill ranges characterized by fault propagation folds with steeply dipping northern limbs and gently dipping southern limbs. From the gradual increasing dimension of the linear chain of hillocks towards the west along the Kutch mainland fault and the epicentre of the earthquake of 2001 lying at the eastern extreme of Kutch mainland fault, it is suggested that the eastern part of the Kutch mainland fault is progressively emerging upward. It can be suggested from the absence of distinct surface rupture both during the 1956 Anjar earthquake and 2001 Bhuj earthquake, that movements have taken place along a blind thrust. Villages situated on the blind thrust in the eastern part of the Kutch mainland hill range (viz. Jawaharnagar, Khirsara, Devisar, Amarsar and Bandhdi) were completely erased during the 2001 earthquake.

=== Rivers and dams ===
There are ninety-seven small rivers in Kutch District, most of which flow into the Arabian Sea, but some of which feed the Rann of Kutch. Twenty major dams, and numerous smaller dams, capture the rainy season runoff. While most of these dams do not affect the Ranns, as they are on rivers that feed directly into the Arabian Sea, storage of rainy season water upstream from Kutch and its use in irrigation has resulted in less fresh water coming into the Ranns of Kutch during the rainy season. This is true of the Great Rann, but particularly true of the Little Rann which is fed by the Luni, Rupen, the Bambhan, the Malwan, the Kankawati, and the Saraswati rivers. However sea water from the Arabian Sea still continues to be driven into the Great Rann by storm tides aided by high winds. Water remains a serious issue in Kutch. Kutch&#x27;s thirst for water is satisfied by Narmada river flowing from Sardar Sarovar dam.


=== Divisions ===

Kutch is divided into four zones: 

* Wagad (including Rapar, Bhachau taluka and Little Rann)

* Kanthi (coastal area, derived from Gujarati:કાંઠો), comprising Mundra and half of Mandvi taluka.

* Banni (with Pascham; includes Bhuj, Nakhatrana and surrounding areas)

* Makpat (includes part of Nakhatrana and Lakhapat taluka).

Under the Kutch princely state, Kutch was divided into Bani, Abdasa, Anjar, Banni, Bhuvad Chovisi, Garado, Halar Chovisi, Kand, Kantho, Khadir, Modaso, Pranthal, Prawar, and Vagad.

Kutch District is further divided into six subdistricts, each comprising one or two taluka: 

* Bhuj (Bhuj taluka)

* Anjar (Anjar and Gandhidham)

* Bhachau (Bhachau and Rapar)

* Mundra (Mundra and Mandvi)

* Nakhatrana (Nakhatrana and Lakhpat)

* Naliya (Abdasa-Naliya)

=== Wildlife sanctuaries and reserves ===

From the city Bhuj various ecologically rich and wildlife conservation areas of the Kutch district can be visited such as Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary, Banni Grasslands Reserve and Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve.
== Demographics ==

According to the 2011 census Kutch District has a population of 2,092,371, roughly equal to the nation of North Macedonia or the US state of New Mexico. This gives it a ranking of 217th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 32.16%. Kutch has a sex ratio of 908 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 71.58%. 34.81% of the population lived in urban areas. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 12.37% and 1.05% of the population respectively.

=== Religion ===
Kutch district has a Hindu majority and Muslim minority with around 1% of Jains. Most Muslims are rural and Kutchi-speaking, and are concentrated in areas closest to the Pakistan border such as Banni. Lakhpat (41.20%) and Abdasa (38.01%) taluks have significant concentration of Muslims, while rural areas of Bhuj taluk have nearly 40% Muslims. Elsewhere, Gujarati Hindus and Muslims are in proportions consistent with the rest of Gujarat.

===Language===


According to the 2011 Census, Kachchhi speakers are a majority in 5 out of the 10 tehsils: Abdasa (76.06%), Lakhpat (69.71%), Mandvi (62.48%), Nakhatrana (54.54%) and Mundra (50.66%). In addition, they are 43.39% in Bhuj, 18.06% in Anjar and 14.13% in Gandhidham. However in Rapar and Bhachau, they are only 0.14% and 1.05% respectively.

Kutchi is classified as a dialect of Sindhi. A common misconception is that it is a dialect of Gujarati. The script of the Kutchi language has become extinct. It is now mainly written in the Gujarati script. Samples of Kutch script are available in the Kutch Museum. The increased use of Gujarati language is mainly because of its being a medium of instruction in schools.

Professional courses in engineering, pharmacy and management are regulated through the Gujarat Technological University.

== Culture ==

=== People ===
Kutch district is inhabited by various groups and communities. One can find various nomadic, semi nomadic and artisan groups living in Kutch. Rabari constitute a comparatively large group in Kutch And there lives a brave and noble community like Ahir.

=== Food and drink ===

Because most of the population of the Kutch district is Hindu or Jain, the food of the region is largely vegetarian. Jains also refrain from eating root vegetables (&quot;kandmool&quot; in Hindi) such as potatoes, garlic, onions, and yams. The district also features a sizeable population of Muslims, who eat vegetables, chicken, mutton and occasionally camel meat.

In the villages of the district, staple foods include kadi-khichdi, milk, and bajra (pearl millet). The latter of these was introduced to the region by a king named Lakho Fulani, who was himself introduced to the grain during his period of exile. Bajara na rotla with curd and buttermilk is also a staple among the Gujarati people.

In the region, milk is considered to be a sacred food; an offering of milk is considered a gesture of friendship and welcoming, and dispute settlements invariably involve the parties offering milk to each other. Similarly, in Kutchi engagement ceremonies, the bride&#x27;s family offers milk to the groom&#x27;s family as a symbol of accepting their relationship. They also extensively drink buttermilk during lunch.

Tea is the most popular drink in this region.

== Economy ==
Historically Kutch was always considered a backward region due to its location and submerged geography. The situation seemed to have worsened after the disastrous Kutch earthquake in 2001. But in the next decade, the economy took an almost miraculous jump start due to the intense efforts of the Gujarat government. Kutch today is a growing economic and industrial hub in one of India&#x27;s fastest growing states – Gujarat. Its location on the far western edge of India has resulted in the commissioning of two major ports: Kandla and Mundra. These ports are closest to the Gulf of Arabia (and thus to Europe by sea). The hinterland of north-western India hosts more than 50% of India&#x27;s population.

Quality of roads is good in Kutch. The large part of the growth of Kutch came after intense development by the state government as part of 2001 earthquake relief.

Due to the existence of two major ports i.e. Kandla and Mundra transportation as a business has thrived. Since historical times the people of Kutch have formed the backbone of trade between Gujarat mainland and Sindh. After the formation of Pakistan this trade stopped for good, but due to the inception of the Kandla port, trade boomed again. Kandla port is also in Kutch. It is considered Gateway to India&#x27;s North. It is managed by the Kandla Port trust.

=== Mineral ===

Kutch is a mineral rich region with a very large reserve of Lignite, Bauxite, Gypsum and other minerals. Kutch received tax break for industries for 15 years after the major earthquake on 26 January 2001.
Lignite is mined only by Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation (GMDC) at its two mines in Panandhro and Mata no Madh. The Panandaro mines has now been reserved for GEB and GMDC power plants and GMDC has stopped supplying other industries from there.

=== Cement and power ===
Kutch also houses cement plants Gujarat Anjan Cement Limited promoted by infrastructure conglomerate Anjan Group and Sanghi Industries Ltd&#x27;s promoted by Sanghi Group. The companies are now planning to increase the capacity at Abdasa location from 3–9 million tons per annum. By 2015, the company plans to produce 20 million tons.

=== Forestry ===
Kutch district has a scanty forest cover. Hence there is negligible risk of illegal cutting of forests. This coupled with the adequate facilities available at Kandla port has helped establish the timber market. In 1987, &quot;Kandla Timber Association&quot; was formed in order to resolve the specific problems of timber importers and timber allied industries coming up during the period. The timber industry is growing at a faster pace with 300 saw mills working in Gandhidham-Kandla Complex.

=== Salt ===

The Little Rann of Kutch is known for its traditional salt production and various references mention this to be a 600-year-old activity. During the British period, this activity increased manifold. It was used to fund a substantial part of the military expenses of the British government.

Communities involved in salt production are mainly Chunvaliya Koli, Ahir and Miyana (Muslim), residing in 107 villages in the periphery of Lesser Rann of Kutch. These communities are traditionally known to have the skills of salt production and are known as &#x27;Agariyas&#x27;. Water quality in 107 villages of Lesser Rann of Kutch is saline, thus agriculture is not an option. Hence salt production is the only livelihood option for Agariyas. As per the Salt Commission&#x27;s report there are 45000 Agariyas working in the salt pans of Kutch. Out of the estimated total annual production of India of about 18 million tonnes, Gujarat contributes 75% – mainly from Kutch and other parts of Saurashtra.

=== Textile art ===
Kutch is one of the most prolific regions in India in the area of textile art. Kutch Embroidery is dense with motifs, and a variation with mirrors sewn into the embroidery is one of the signature arts of this region.

Within the category of Kutch embroidery there are several sub-categories as each tribe and sub-tribe produces a unique signature form of art.

Kutchi embroidery is an evolving expression of the craft and textile traditions of the Rabaris, a nomadic tribe in Gujarat. Kutch embroidery is unique in the sense that a net is woven on a cloth using thread. The net is then filled in using the same thread by intricate interlocking stitches. The patterns are usually built around geometric shapes. This embroidery follows its own traditional design logic and juxtaposition of colours and motifs. The Rohanas tribals of Kutch specialise in skirt work. The Sodhas use a geometric style for their embroidery. The Garacia Jats are experts in tiny embroidery on the yoke, which intermingles with red, orange, blue and green threads. The Dhanetah Jats love embroidering broad pear-shaped mirrors using orange, black, yellow and red in chain stitch.

== In culture ==

J. P. Dutta&#x27;s Bollywood film &quot;Refugee&quot; is shot on location in the Great Rann of Kutch and other locations in the Kutch district of Gujarat, India. This film is attributed to have been inspired by the famous story by Keki N.

<doc id="845699" wikidata="Q5249416" url="?curid=845699" title="Declaration of Conscience">
<text>The Declaration of Conscience was a Cold War speech made by U.S. Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith on June 1, 1950, less than four months after Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Wheeling Speech&quot;, on February 9, 1950. Her speech was endorsed by six other liberal-to-moderate Republicans. In it, she criticized national leadership and called for the country, the United States Senate, and the Republican Party to re-examine the tactics used by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and (without naming him) Senator McCarthy. She stated the basic principles of &quot;Americanism&quot; were:

*The right to criticize;
*The right to hold unpopular beliefs;
*The right to protest;
*The right of independent thought.

Smith voiced concern that those who exercised those beliefs at that time risked unfairly being labeled communist or fascist.

In the Declaration of Conscience, Smith said,

The Democratic administration has greatly lost the confidence of the American people by its complacency to the threat of communism and the leak of vital secrets to Russia through key officials of the Democratic administration. There are enough proved cases to make this point without diluting our criticism with unproved charges.

Surely these are sufficient reasons to make it clear to the American people that it is time for a change and that a Republican victory is necessary to the security of this country. Surely it is clear that this nation will continue to suffer as long as it is governed by the present ineffective Democratic Administration.

Yet to displace it with a Republican regime embracing a philosophy that lacks political integrity or intellectual honesty would prove equally disastrous to this nation. The nation sorely needs a Republican victory. But I don&#x27;t want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny – Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear.

I doubt if the Republican Party could – simply because I don&#x27;t believe the American people will uphold any political party that puts political exploitation above national interest.

The other Senators who signed onto the Declaration were Wayne Morse of Oregon, George Aiken of Vermont, Edward J. Thye of Minnesota, Irving Ives of New York, Charles W. Tobey of New Hampshire, and Robert C. Hendrickson of New Jersey. While the initial reception was chilly, the full-fledged outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, had made it unlikely that Smith&#x27;s views would prevail. The only signatory whose outrage remained undimmed was Wayne Morse, who eventually left the party, first becoming an independent, then a Democrat.

Bernard Baruch stated that if a man had given the Declaration speech &quot;he would be the next President.&quot;

The speech was listed as #41 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

Although it would be another four years before McCarthy would be censured, the fact that a woman was the first to speak out in the Senate against such tactics holds significance for feminist historians.

<text>Variable valve timing (VVT) is the process of altering the timing of a valve lift event in an internal combustion engine, and is often used to improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. It is increasingly being used in combination with variable valve lift systems. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, ranging from mechanical devices to electro-hydraulic and camless systems. Increasingly strict emissions regulations are causing many automotive manufacturers to use VVT systems.

Two-stroke engines use a power valve system to get similar results to VVT.

==Background theory==
The valves within an internal combustion engine are used to control the flow of the intake and exhaust gases into and out of the combustion chamber. The timing, duration and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without variable valve timing (variable valve lift), the valve timing is the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary to achieve the desired result in intake and exhaust efficiency . This has been described in simulations. Practical results will vary based on available ambient combustion cycle gases in a naturally aspirated system, or forced air geometry as well as fuel pulse width timing and other factors which may or may not be available on vehicles equipped with variable valve timing. An engine equipped with a variable valve timing actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range.

Piston engines normally use valves which are driven by camshafts. The cams open (&quot;lift&quot;) the valves for a certain amount of time (&quot;duration&quot;) during each intake and exhaust cycle. The &quot;timing&quot; of the valve opening and closing, relative to the position of the crankshaft, is important. The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft through timing belts, gears or chains.

An engine requires large amounts of air when operating at high speeds. However, the intake valves may close before enough air has entered each combustion chamber, reducing performance. On the other hand, if the camshaft keeps the valves open for longer periods of time, as with a racing cam, problems start to occur at the lower engine speeds. Opening the intake valve while the exhaust valve is still open may cause unburnt fuel to exit the engine, leading to lower engine performance and increased emissions. According to engineer David Vizard&#x27;s book &quot;Building Horsepower&quot;, when both intake &amp; exhaust are open simultaneously, the much-higher-pressure exhaust pushes the intake-charge back, out from the cylinder, polluting the intake manifold with exhaust.

===Continuous versus discrete===
Early variable valve timing systems used discrete (stepped) adjustment. For example, one timing would be used below 3500 rpm and another used above 3500 rpm.

More advanced variable valve timing systems offer continuous (infinite) adjustment of the valve timing. Therefore, the timing can be optimized to suit all engine speeds and conditions.

===Cam phasing versus variable duration===
The simplest form of VVT is &quot;cam-phasing&quot;, whereby the phase angle of the camshaft is rotated forwards or backwards relative to the crankshaft. Thus the valves open and close earlier or later; however, the camshaft lift and duration cannot be altered solely with a cam-phasing system.

Achieving variable duration on a VVT system requires a complex system, such as multiple cam profiles or oscillating cams.

==Typical effect of timing adjustments==
Late intake valve closing (LIVC)
The first variation of continuous variable valve timing involves holding the intake valve open slightly longer than a traditional engine. This results in the piston actually pushing air out of the cylinder and back into the intake manifold during the compression stroke. The air which is expelled fills the manifold with higher pressure, and on subsequent intake strokes the air which is taken in is at a higher pressure. Late intake valve closing has been shown to reduce pumping losses by 40% during partial load conditions, and to decrease nitric oxide (NOx) emissions by 24%. Peak engine torque showed only a 1% decline, and hydrocarbon emissions were unchanged.
Early intake valve closing (EIVC)
Another way to decrease the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the intake valve earlier than normal. This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces pumping losses. Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake valve closing is that it significantly lowers the temperature of the combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.
Early intake valve opening
Early intake valve opening is another variation that has significant potential to reduce emissions. In a traditional engine, a process called valve overlap is used to aid in controlling the cylinder temperature. By opening the intake valve early, some of the inert/combusted exhaust gas will back flow out of the cylinder via the intake valve, where it cools momentarily in the intake manifold. This inert gas then fills the cylinder in the subsequent intake stroke, which aids in controlling the temperature of the cylinder and nitric oxide emissions. It also improves volumetric efficiency, because there is less exhaust gas to be expelled on the exhaust stroke.
Early/late exhaust valve closing
Early and late exhaust valve closing timing can be manipulated to reduce emissions. Traditionally, the exhaust valve opens, and exhaust gas is pushed out of the cylinder and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating the timing of the exhaust valve, engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the exhaust valve open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.

==Challenges==
The main factor preventing this technology from wide use in production automobiles is the ability to produce a cost-effective means of controlling the valve timing under the conditions internal to an engine. An engine operating at 3000 revolutions per minute will rotate the camshaft 25 times per second, so the valve timing events have to occur at precise times to offer performance benefits. Electromagnetic and pneumatic camless valve actuators offer the greatest control of precise valve timing, but, in 2016, are not cost-effective for production vehicles.

==History==

===Steam engines===
The history of the search for a method of variable valve opening duration goes back to the age of steam engines when the valve opening duration was referred to as &quot;steam cut-off”. The Stephenson valve gear, as used on early steam locomotives, supported variable cutoff, that is, changes to the time at which the admission of steam to the cylinders is cut off during the power stroke.

Early approaches to variable cutoff coupled variations in admission cutoff with variations in exhaust cutoff. Admission and exhaust cutoff were decoupled with the development of the Corliss valve. These were widely used in constant speed variable load stationary engines, with admission cutoff, and therefore torque, mechanically controlled by a centrifugal governor and trip valves.

As poppet valves came into use, a simplified valve gear using a camshaft came into use. With such engines, variable cutoff could be achieved with variable profile cams that were shifted along the camshaft by the governor. The Serpollet steamcars produced very hot high pressure steam, requiring poppet valves, and these used a patented sliding camshaft mechanism, which not only varied the inlet valve cut-off but allowed the engine to be reversed.

===Aircraft===
An early experimental 200 hp Clerget V-8 from the 1910s used a sliding camshaft to change the valve timing. Some versions of the Bristol Jupiter radial engine of the early 1920s incorporated variable valve timing gear, mainly to vary the inlet valve timing in connection with higher compression ratios. The Lycoming R-7755 engine had a Variable Valve Timing system consisting of two cams that can be selected by the pilot. One for take off, pursuit and escape, the other for economical cruising.

===Automotive===
The desirability of being able to vary the valve opening duration to match an engine&#x27;s rotational speed first became apparent in the 1920s when maximum allowable RPM limits were generally starting to rise. Until about this time an engine&#x27;s idle RPM and its operating RPM were very similar, meaning that there was little need for variable valve duration. The first use of variable valve timing was on the 1903 Cadillac Runabout and Tonneau created by Alanson Partridge Brush Patent 767,794 “INLET VALVE GEAR FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES” filed August 3, 1903, and granted August 16, 1904. Some time prior to 1919 Lawrence Pomeroy, Vauxhall&#x27;s Chief Designer, had designed a 4.4 L engine for a proposed replacement for the existing 30-98 model to be called the H-Type. In this engine the single overhead camshaft was to move longitudinally to allow different camshaft lobes to be engaged. It was in the 1920s that the first patents for variable duration valve opening started appearing – for example United States patent .

In 1958 Porsche made application for a German Patent, also applied for and published as British Patent GB861369 in 1959. The Porsche patent used an oscillating cam to increase the valve lift and duration. The desmodromic cam driven via a push/pull rod from an eccentric shaft or swashplate. It is unknown if any working prototype was ever made.

Fiat was the first auto manufacturer to patent a functional automotive variable valve timing system which included variable lift. Developed by Giovanni Torazza in the late 1960s, the system used hydraulic pressure to vary the fulcrum of the cam followers (US Patent 3,641,988). The hydraulic pressure changed according to engine speed and intake pressure. The typical opening variation was 37%.

Alfa Romeo was the first manufacturer to use a variable valve timing system in production cars (US Patent 4,231,330). The fuel injected models of the 1980 Alfa Romeo Spider 2000 had a mechanical VVT system. The system was engineered by Ing Giampaolo Garcea in the 1970s. All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT.

In 1989, Honda released the VTEC system. While the earlier Nissan NVCS alters the phasing of the camshaft, VTEC switches to a separate cam profile at high engine speeds to improve peak power. The first VTEC engine Honda produced was the B16A which was installed in the Integra, CRX, and Civic hatchback available in Japan and Europe.

In 1992, Porsche first introduced VarioCam, which was the first system to provide continuous adjustment (all previous systems used discrete adjustment). The system was released in the Porsche 968 and operated on the intake valves only.

====Motorcycles====
Variable valve timing has been applied to motorcycle engines but was considered a non-useful &quot;technological showpiece&quot; as late as 2004 due to the system&#x27;s weight penalty. Since then, motorcycles including VVT have included the Kawasaki 1400GTR/Concours 14 (2007), the Ducati Multistrada 1200 (2015), the BMW R1250GS (2019) and the Yamaha YZF-R15 V3.0 (2017), the Suzuki GSX-R1000R 2017 L7, the Moto Guzzi V85TT, the Harley Davidson Milwaukee-Eight, the KTM 1390 Super Duke.

===Marine===
Variable valve timing has begun to trickle down to marine engines. Volvo Penta&#x27;s VVT marine engine uses a cam phaser, controlled by the ECM, which continuously varies advancement or retardation of the camshaft timing.

===Diesel===
In 2007, Caterpillar developed the C13 and C15 Acert engines which used VVT technology to reduce NOx emissions, to avoid the use of EGR after 2002 EPA requirements.

In 2010, Mitsubishi developed and started mass production of its 4N13 1.8 L DOHC I4, the world&#x27;s first passenger car diesel engine that features a variable valve timing system.

==Methods for implementing variable valve control (VVC)==

===Cam switching===
This method uses two cam profiles, with an actuator to swap between the profiles (usually at a specific engine speed). Cam switching can also provide variable valve lift and variable duration, however the adjustment is discrete rather than continuous.

The first production use of this system was Honda&#x27;s VTEC system. VTEC changes hydraulic pressure to actuate a pin that locks the high lift, high duration rocker arm to an adjacent low lift, low duration rocker arm(s).

===Cam phasing===

Many production VVT systems are the &quot;cam phasing&quot; type, using a device known as a variator which changes the phase (Phase refers to the relative timing between the inlet and exhaust camshafts, expressed as an angular measure.) of the camshaft and valves. This allows continuous adjustment of the cam timing (although many early systems only used discrete adjustment), however the duration and lift cannot be adjusted.

===Oscillating cam===
These designs use an oscillating or rocking motion in a part cam lobe, which acts on a follower. This follower then opens and closes the valve. Some oscillating cam systems use a conventional cam lobe, while others use an eccentric cam lobe and a connecting rod. The principle is similar to steam engines, where the amount of steam entering the cylinder was regulated by the steam &quot;cut-off&quot; point.

The advantage of this design is that adjustment of lift and duration is continuous. However, in these systems, lift is proportional to duration, so lift and duration cannot be separately adjusted.

The BMW (valvetronic), Nissan (VVEL), and Toyota (valvematic) oscillating cam systems act on the intake valves only.

===Eccentric cam drive===
Eccentric cam drive systems operates through an eccentric disc mechanism which slows and speeds up the angular speed of the cam lobe during its rotation. Arranging the lobe to slow during its open period is equivalent to lengthening its duration.

The advantage of this system is that duration can be varied independent of lift (however this system does not vary lift). The drawback is two eccentric drives and controllers are needed for each cylinder (one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves), which increases complexity and cost.

MG Rover is the only manufacturer that has released engines using this system.

===Three-dimensional cam lobe===
This system consists of a cam lobe that varies along its length (similar to a cone shape). One end of the cam lobe has a short duration/reduced lift profile, and the other end has a longer duration/greater lift profile. In between, the lobe provides a smooth transition between these two profiles. By shifting area of the cam lobe which is in contact with the follower, the lift and duration can be continuously altered. This is achieved by moving the camshaft axially (sliding it across the engine) so a stationary follower is exposed to a varying lobe profile to produce different amounts of lift and duration. The downside to this arrangement is that the cam and follower profiles must be carefully designed to minimise contact stress (due to the varying profile).

Ferrari is commonly associated with this system, however it is unknown whether any production models to date have used this system.

===Two shaft combined cam lobe profile===
This system is not known to be used in any production engines.

It consists of two (closely spaced) parallel camshafts, with a pivoting follower that spans both camshafts and is acted on by two lobes simultaneously. Each camshaft has a phasing mechanism which allows its angular position relative to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft to be adjusted. One lobe controls the opening of a valve and the other controls the closing of the same valve, therefore variable duration is achieved through the spacing of these two events.

The drawbacks to this design include:
*At long duration settings, one lobe may be starting to reduce its lift as the other is still increasing. This has the effect of lessening the overall lift and possibly causing dynamic problems. One company claims to have solved the uneven rate of opening of the valve problem to some extent thus allowing long duration at full lift.
*Size of the system, due to the parallel shafts, the larger followers etc.

===Coaxial two shaft combined cam lobe profile===
This system is not known to be used in any production engines.

The operating principle is that the one follower spans the pair of closely spaced lobes. Up to the angular limit of the nose radius the follower &#x27;sees&#x27; the combined surface of the two lobes as a continuous, smooth surface. When the lobes are exactly aligned the duration is at a minimum (and equal to that of each lobe alone) and when at the extreme extent of their misalignment the duration is at a maximum. The basic limitation of the scheme is that only a duration variation equal to that of the lobe nose true radius (in camshaft degrees or double this value in crankshaft degrees) is possible. In practice this type of variable cam has a maximum range of duration variation of about forty crankshaft degrees.

This is the principle behind what seems to be the very first variable cam suggestion appearing in the USPTO patent files in 1925 (1527456). The &quot;Clemson camshaft&quot; is of this type.

===Helical camshaft===

Also known as &quot;combined two shaft coaxial combined profile with helical movement&quot;, this system is not known to be used in any production engines.

It has a similar principle to the previous type, and can use the same base duration lobe profile. However instead of rotation in a single plane, the adjustment is both axial and rotational giving a helical or three-dimensional aspect to its movement. This movement overcomes the restricted duration range in the previous type. The duration range is theoretically unlimited but typically would be of the order of one hundred crankshaft degrees, which is sufficient to cover most situations.

The cam is reportedly difficult and expensive to produce, requiring very accurate helical machining and careful assembly.

===Camless engines===

Engine designs which do not rely on a camshaft to operate the valves have greater flexibility in achieving variable valve timing and variable valve lift. The only production car that uses the camless design so far is the Koenigsegg Gemera.

===Hydraulic system===

This system utilizes the engine lube oil to control the closure of inlet valve. The intake valve opening mechanism incorporates a valve tappet and a piston inside a chamber. There is a solenoid valve controlled by the engine control system which gets energized and supplies oil through a non-return valve during the time of cam lift and the oil gets filled in the chamber and the return channel to the sump is blocked by the valve tappet. During the downward movement of the cam, at a particular instant, the return passage opens and the oil pressure gets released to the engine sump.

<text>Simcoe North () is a federal electoral district in central Ontario, Canada. It was established as a federal riding in 1867, and is the only electoral district in Ontario, and one of four in Canada, that has continually existed since Confederation.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2021 Canadian census&quot;

Ethnic groups: 84.0% White, 11.8% Indigenous, 1.0% South Asian
Languages: 89.7% English, 2.6% French
Religions: 54.3% Christian (23.8% Catholic, 7.3% United Church, 6.2% Anglican, 3.0% Presbyterian, 1.8% Baptist, 12.2% Other), 43.4% None. 
Median income: $38,800 (2020) 
Average income: $48,680 (2020)

==Geography==
The district includes all of the north and eastern parts of Simcoe County. Municipalities and Indian reserves include Midland, Orillia, Penetanguishene, Tay, Tiny, Christian Island 30, Christian Island 30A, Severn, Ramara, Oro-Medonte (part) and Mnjikaning First Nation. The area is 1,752 km2.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1867 by the British North America Act. In 1867, it included the townships of Nottawasaga, Sunnidale, Vespra, Flos, Oro, Medonte, Orillia and Matchedash, Tiny and Tay, Balaklava and Robinson, and the Towns of Barrie and Collingwood. In 1882, it lost Oro, Medonte, Orillia and Matchedash, Tiny and Tay, and Balaklava and Robinson. In 1903, it gained Oro, but lost Barrie. In 1947, it lost Oro and gained Barrie. In 1966, it lost Nottawasaga, Sunnidale and Flos and gained Penetanguishene, Matchedash, Medonte, Orillia, Oro, and Tay. In 1976, it gained the townships of Mara, Rama and Tiny but Lost Barrie and Vespra. In 1987, it gained Flos Township, only to lose it again in the 1996 redistribution. In the 2003 redistribution, its southern boundary was altered slightly to follow the boundary of the new municipality of Springwater in neighbouring Simcoe—Grey with the municipalities of Oro-Medonte, Tiny and Tay in Simcoe North. In 2013, the riding lost all of Oro-Medonte west of 9 Line.

==Riding associations==

Riding associations are the local branches of the national political parties:

==Members of Parliament==

Simcoe North has elected the following members of Parliament to represent it in the House of Commons of Canada:

<text>The Ford Fairmont is a model line of compact cars that was manufactured by Ford from the 1978 to 1983 model years. The successor of the Ford Maverick, the Fairmont marked the third generation of compact sedans sold by Ford in North America. Initially slotted between the Pinto and Granada within the Ford line, the Fairmont was later marketed between the Ford Escort and Ford LTD. In contrast to its predecessor (only offered as a two-door or four-door sedan), the model line was offered as a two-door notchback sedan, two-door coupe, four-door sedan, and five-door station wagon. Though never sold as a Lincoln, Mercury sold a divisional counterpart of the Fairmont as the Mercury Zephyr.

The inaugural model lines of the rear-wheel drive Ford Fox platform (which served to replace models based on the Ford Falcon), the Fairmont and Zephyr would come to share that platform with twelve additional model lines for Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln. Though the Fairmont itself was produced for only six model years, the Fox platform would continue for another two decades, underpinning vehicles (in updated form) through the 2004 model year.

Through its production, Ford manufactured the Fairmont at numerous facilities across North America. On November 15, 1977, a Fairmont (a 1978 Fairmont Futura coupe) became the 100 millionth vehicle assembled by Ford Motor Company. For 1984, the model line was replaced with the front-wheel drive Ford Tempo.

==Background and development==
In April 1973, the American EPA released its comprehensive list of fuel economy results. In October of the same year, the 1973 oil crisis started. At the time, Ford&#x27;s North American product line included the subcompact Pinto and Mustang II, and the compact Maverick, but replacements for all of these models would soon be needed. At the same time, Ford of England&#x27;s Cortina line was in need of refreshing, as was the Taunus model built by Ford of Germany.

Changes were also happening at Ford&#x27;s executive level, as William O. Bourke, ex-chairman of Ford of Europe and one-time managing director of Ford of Australia, was made executive vice president of North American Operations and Robert Alexander, previously with Ford of Europe as vice president in charge of car development, moved to same position in the States.

Hal Sperlich was vice-president of product planning and research at Ford. A proponent of downsizing, Sperlich conceived of a &quot;world car&quot; that could be sold in both Europe and North America as a solution to the needs of the various divisions.

Some sources suggest that the &quot;Fox&quot; name was borrowed from the Audi 80, sold in the US and Australia as the &quot;Audi Fox&quot; beginning in May 1973, because Ford&#x27;s executives considered the 80 their class-leading subcompact competitor, and made it the baseline reference for the new platform. Another reports that Ford used the Fox name in an internal report as early as February 1973, making it less likely to have been borrowed from the German model. In December 1973, Ford President Lee Iacocca formally approved development of the Fox platform.

Although the Fairmont would be the first Fox-based car to reach the market, development was guided by an anticipated sport coupe to be based on the new platform.

Development started in early 1973 on both a short wheelbase version, to replace the Pinto/Cortina/Taunus lines, and a long-wheelbase version, that would become the Fairmont. By 1974, the difficulties faced in meeting the conflicting regulatory requirements in different markets and differing production methods used by the various divisions had killed the world car idea. In 1975, North American Automobile Operations took over development of the Fox platform from Sperlich&#x27;s Product Planning and Research group.

The first running Fox/Fairmont prototype was a modified Cortina with a MacPherson strut and torsion bar front suspension.

A 1980 Fairmont station wagon converted to an electric vehicle by Electric Vehicles Associates Inc. and renamed the &quot;EVA Current Fare Wagon&quot; was evaluated by the US Department of Energy from March 1980 to November 1981.

==Model overview==
The Ford Fairmont was launched in August 1977 as a 1978 model. The name was first used by Ford in 1965 for the Australian Fairmont, an upscale trim level model of the Ford Falcon (XP), and had also been used in the South African market in 1969.

===Chassis specifications===
The Fairmont is based on the rear-wheel drive Ford Fox platform, using steel unibody construction. The independent front suspension comprised lower lateral arms, MacPherson struts, and helical-wound coil springs. In what Ford called a &quot;modified&quot; or &quot;hybrid&quot; MacPherson strut system, the coil springs were mounted separately from the struts rather than concentrically, being located between the lower arm and front cross-member. A front anti-roll bar was standard equipment. The rear suspension used a solid axle suspended on coil springs and vertically mounted dampers. The axle was located by four links; two lower trailing arms and two sharply angled upper control arms.

The Fairmont has power-assisted brakes, with 10.0 inch vented front discs and 9.0 x 1.8 inch rear drums. Standard wheels and tires were 14x5.0 and DR78-14 respectively. Steering was by a rack and pinion system with 3.2 turns lock-to-lock.

===Powertrain===
For its entire production run, the standard engine for the Fairmont was a inline-4 (shared with the Pinto). Initially producing 88 hp, following several revisions, output rose to 90 hp by 1983. The 2.3 L engine was initially paired with a 3-speed manual (replaced by a 4-speed in 1979), with a 3-speed automatic offered as an option. For 1980 only, a 120 hp turbocharged version of the 2.3 L engine (shared with the Mustang Cobra) was available in Fairmont sedans and coupes. Examples with the turbocharged engine were distinguished by a center-mounted hood &quot;power bulge&quot;.

As an option, a inline-6 (shared with the Maverick and Granada) was offered from 1978 to 1983 model years. While offering less horsepower than the 2.3 L inline-4, the 3.3 L inline-6 produced significantly more torque. For 1978, the standard transmission was a 3-speed manual (replaced by a 4-speed for 1979); a 3-speed automatic was offered as an option.

For 1978 to 1981 model years, the Fairmont was offered with two different Windsor V8 engines (shared with mid-size and full-size Ford vehicles). For 1978 and 1979, a 139 hp V8 was offered, available with a 4-speed manual transmission for the 1979 model year only. It was replaced by a 115 hp V8 for 1980 and 1981. The 255 engine was paired exclusively with a 3-speed automatic transmission.


===Body design===
The Fairmont debuted for 1978 with three body configurations; a two-door sedan, a four-door sedan, and a five-door station wagon. The wagon was available in both base Fairmont and higher Fairmont Squire trims. Late in the 1978 model year (December 1977), a two-door coupe was introduced; named &quot;Futura&quot;, the name revived the sporty trim level used for the 1960s Ford Falcon.

The Fairmont Futura was developed from a Fairmont-based Thunderbird design proposal from March 1976. The Futura was a two-door coupe distinguished by a model-specific roofline that featured a wrapover B-pillar similar to the 1977–1979 Ford Thunderbird but without opera windows. The rear fascia was also given its own wrap-around taillamp design. To further differentiate the Futura from the standard Fairmont, the coupe was fitted with the 4-headlight fascia from the Zephyr, and a cross-hatched grille was used in place of the standard eggcrate grille. For the 1980 model year Ford expanded the Futura nameplate to include a four-door sedan and added a Futura station wagon for 1981.

For 1981, the exterior trim was revised with the addition of a slim molding strip along the side exterior panels; convenience equipment was also increased. For 1982, several model revisions were made. Ford moved the Fairmont station wagon to the Granada model line and the Futura trim became the sole trim, expanding it to the two-door sedan for the first time. Effectively, this standardized the four-headlight front fascia (of the Futura coupe and Mercury Zephyr).

For 1983, Ford introduced an &quot;S&quot; model of the Fairmont Futura as a base trim. Sold only as a sedan and only with the 2.3 L engine, the radio and right-hand mirror of the Futura S became options.

==Discontinuation==

During the early 1980s, Ford undertook a major revision of its product ranges. Following the 1981 introduction of the Ford Escort, the automaker sought to expand its use of front-wheel drive across the compact and mid-size segment; the rear-wheel drive Fox platform remained in production, used mainly for performance and luxury vehicles (the Mustang, Thunderbird, their Lincoln-Mercury counterparts, but also the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis).

Released for the 1984 model year, the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz replaced the Fairmont/Zephyr. An extended-wheelbase sedan counterpart of the Escort/Lynx, the front-wheel drive Tempo and Topaz followed the Thunderbird in using aerodynamic-influenced exterior styling. As the Fairmont was ending its model cycle in 1983, it became the only Ford model in North America to retain the &quot;FORD&quot; lettering in place of the Ford Blue Oval emblem; the Thunderbird (which used its own emblem) never used Ford badging on the grille.

The same one-piece lift-up tailgate designed for the Fairmont wagon was also used on the fourth generation Australian XD, XE and XF series Ford Falcon and Fairmont wagons, which were produced until 1988.

==Mercury Zephyr==

From the 1978 to 1983 model years, the Mercury Zephyr served as the Mercury counterpart of the Ford Fairmont, replacing the Maverick-based Comet. The third vehicle to use the nameplate within Ford Motor Company, the Mercury Zephyr shares its nameplate with the 1936–1940 Lincoln-Zephyr and the 1950–1972 Ford Zephyr (produced by Ford of Britain). Within the Mercury line, the Zephyr was slotted between the Bobcat (replaced for 1981 by the Lynx) and the Monarch (replaced for 1981 by the Cougar).

Sharing the same model range as the Fairmont, the Zephyr was offered as two-door and four-door sedans, a five-door station wagon, and the two-door &quot;Zephyr Z-7&quot; coupe. At its launch, the Zephyr was externally distinguished by the use of four headlights (initially only used by the Fairmont Futura). The exterior was styled with design elements that were adopted by multiple Mercury product lines during the early 1980s (the Lynx, Capri, Cougar, and Marquis), including a waterfall-style grille, horizontally-ribbed taillamps, and (non-functional) front fender vents.

The Zephyr was initially offered in standard, ES (a successor to the ESS trim of the Monarch), and Ghia trims, for 1981, both were replaced by GS trim (the equivalent of Futura on non-coupe Fairmonts). In line with other Mercury station wagons, the model line was offered with a Villager option package, including exterior (simulated) woodgrain trim.

At the beginning of the 1980s, the Zephyr was gradually phased out of the Mercury model line. For 1982, both the 4.2-liter V8 option and the station wagon were moved to the more upscale Cougar model line. As Mercury transitioned its model line to front-wheel drive, the Zephyr was replaced by the Mercury Topaz for the 1984 model year.

Following its use by Mercury, the Zephyr nameplate was briefly reused by Lincoln in 2006. The Lincoln Zephyr mid-size sedan was renamed the Lincoln MKZ for 2007, commencing the Lincoln &quot;MK&quot; model nomenclature.

==Variants==

===Ford Durango===

The Ford Durango was produced by a joint venture between Ford and National Coach Corporation from 1978 to 1981. Based heavily on the Fairmont Futura coupe, the Durango was a two-door, two-seat car-based pickup truck that was intended as a possible replacement for the 1977–1979 Ford Ranchero as well as a competitor to the downsized Chevrolet El Camino/GMC Caballero. Approximately 200 are estimated to have been produced.

===European Sport Option===
The &quot;European Sport Option&quot; was an appearance and suspension package offered in 1978 through 1980. It is abbreviated &quot;ES Option&quot; or &quot;ESO&quot;. Exterior changes included a black grille, black cowl grille, deluxe bumpers, black window frames, black exterior mirrors, black C-pillar ventilation louvers, bright belt moldings and turbine wheel covers. The interior featured black carpeting, a black three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel, black instrument panel with gray engine-turned trim and black or chamois-colored seats. The running gear was modified with stiffer springs, re-valved shocks, and a rear anti-roll bar. The ESO mounted DR78-14 radial tires on 5.5 inch wheels, one half inch wider than stock.

===Police and Taxicab packages===
In 1978 Ford also made available specially prepared Fairmonts suitable for use as police cars and taxicabs. Initially the only engines offered for these applications were the 200 cubic inch inline six or the 302 V8. Ford&#x27;s product literature lists the following special features for both packages:

* Automatic transmission with first-gear lockout
* Externally-mounted transmission oil cooler
* Power brakes
* Heavy-duty body construction with extra reinforcements
* Heavy-duty suspension package (Police or Taxi), including higher-rate springs, hardened spindles, special shocks and struts
* Cooling package with high fin-density radiator
* Heavy-duty 14 x 5.5 inch wheels

In later years the naturally-aspirated 2.3 L inline four engine became available as well.

A few turbo four-door automatic sedans were used for testing by the California Highway Patrol.

==Other markets==

===Mexico===
The Ford Fairmont was introduced in Mexico in late 1977 as a 1978 model, replacing the Ford Maverick that was produced there locally. The Mexican Fairmont was available exclusively with the 5.0 L engine (302) with manual and three-speed automatic transmissions. It was offered as a two- or four-door sedan and a wagon. The Futura coupe with its distinctive Thunderbird-style roofline was never offered in Mexico. Instead there was an uplevel two-door sedan called the Fairmont Elite. It was distinguished from other Fairmonts by its higher level of equipment and vinyl roof. It used the four headlight grille from the Fairmont Futura along with the Mercury Zephyr&#x27;s taillamps and rear quarter window louvers.

For 1981, all versions of the Fairmont got four headlights. The regular Fairmont continued to use the Futura grille while the Fairmont Elite used the Mercury Zephyr grille.

For 1982 the Fairmont Elite was renamed the Ford Elite II, and was offered in both two- and four-door sedans. The Elite II used the entire front end and matching rear bumper from the 1982 North American Ford Granada. The base Fairmont adapted the Mercury Zephyr grille used on the previous Elite.

For 1983, the Fairmont received a new 3.8 L Essex V6 engine which was sold in addition to the existing V8. This was the last year of the Fairmont as it was replaced later by the Ford Topaz which was a hybrid assembly of the Mercury Topaz with a Ford Tempo front end.

===Venezuela===
A version of the Fairmont was manufactured in Venezuela where it was sold as the Ford Zephyr. The Ford Futura was also sold as an individual model without Fairmont badging.
==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were generally favorable, with many commenting on the &quot;European&quot; feel of the car and comparing it to the Volvo 200 series.

The 1978 Fairmont has been called the &quot;most efficient Ford family (sedan) ever built from a space-per-weight perspective.&quot;

==Motorsports==
In 1978 Bob Glidden campaigned an NHRA Pro Stock Futura powered by a Cleveland V8. The car won its debut race on 8 July 1978 at the Edgewater Winston Championship Series, where it also set a national record. Additional wins followed at the NHRA Grandnational, U.S. Nationals, Fall Nationals, World Finals and Beech Bend WCS. Glidden won his third national championship title with the car. The Futura was retired at the end of the 1978 season.

<text>Junagadh () is the city and headquarters of Junagadh district in the Indian state of Gujarat. Located at the foot of the Girnar hills, southwest of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar (the state capital), it is the seventh largest city in the state. It is dominated by the Chudasama clan of Rajputs since ancient times. 
Literally translated, Junagadh means &quot;Old Fort&quot;. It was a part of Saurashtra state and later Bombay state. In 1960, in consequence of the Maha Gujarat movement, it became part of the newly formed Gujarat state.

==History==
===Early history===
As per the legend, the founder of the Ror Dynasty Raja Dhaj, Ror Kumar, also known as Rai Dyach, ruled over the principality of Jhunagarh in the fifth century BC. An early structure, Uparkot Fort, is located on a plateau in the middle of town. It was originally built in 319 BCE during the Mauryan dynasty by Chandragupta. The fort remained in use until the 6th century, after which it was abandoned for approximately 300 years. It was later rediscovered by the Chudasama ruler Graharipu in 976 CE. The fort was subsequently besieged 16 times over a 1000-year period. One unsuccessful siege lasted twelve years.

Within of Uparkot Fort is an inscription with fourteen Edicts of Ashoka on a large boulder. The inscriptions are in Brahmi script in a language similar to Pali and date from 250 BCE. On the same rock there is a later inscription in Sanskrit, which was added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I, the Saka (Scythian) ruler of Malwa, and a member of the Western Kshatrapas dynasty, and which has been described as &quot;the earliest known Sanskrit inscription of any extent&quot;. Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to Skandagupta, the last Gupta emperor. Old rock-cut Buddhist caves in this area, dating from well before 500 CE, have stone carvings and floral work. There are also the Khapra Kodia Caves north of the fort, and the Bava Pyara Caves south of the fort. The Bava Pyara caves contain artworks of both Buddhism and Jainism.

The Maitraka dynasty ruled Gujarat from 475 to 767 CE. The founder of the dynasty, General Bhatarka, military governor of Saurashtra peninsula under the Gupta Empire, established himself as the independent ruler of Gujarat around the last quarter of the 5th century.

===Chudasama dynasty===
The early history of the Chudasama dynasty – which ruled Saurashtra from Junagadh – is almost lost. Bardic legends vary significantly in the names, order, and number of early rulers, making them unreliable as historical sources. According to tradition, the dynasty is said to have been founded in the late 9th century by Chudachandra. Subsequent rulers such as Graharipu, Navaghana, and Khengara, were in conflict with the Chaulukya rulers Mularaja and Jayasimha Siddharaja; and Saurashtra was briefly governed by Chaulukya governors during this period. These events are recorded in contemporary and later Jain chronicles.

In 1350, Junagadh was conquered by Muhammad bin Tughluq with the help and forces of Koli chieftain Jesaji (Jesing) from Ra Khengar.

After the end of the rule of the Chaulukyas and their successors, the Vaghela dynasty, in Gujarat, the Chudasamas ruled independently, or as vassals of successor states, the Delhi Sultanate and the Gujarat Sultanate. Mandalika I was the first Chudasama ruler known from inscriptions, and during his reign, Gujarat was invaded by the Khalji dynasty of Delhi. The last king of the dynasty, Mandalika III, was defeated and forcibly converted to Islam in 1472 by Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada, who annexed the state.

The Uparkot Fort of Junagadh was occupied by the Chudasamas during the reign of Graharipu. It is said to have been later rebuilt by Navaghana, who had transferred his capital from Vamanasthali to Junagadh. He is also credited with construction of the stepwells Navghan Kuvo and Adi Kadi Vav in the fort. His descendant Khengara is attributed with building a stepwell, Ra Khengar Vav, on the way to Vanthali from Junagadh.

===Gujarat sultanate===
Sultan Mahmud Begada changed the name of Junagadh to Mustafabad and built the fortifications around the town and the mosque in Uparkot Fort.

Under the Gujarat Sultanate, Junagadh was governed by an official, styled &quot;&quot; (commander), appointed directly by Ahmedabad. This official collected the tribute and revenue of the crown domain. The first &quot;thanadar&quot; was Tatar Khan, an adopted son of the Sultan and after him Mirza Khalil, the eldest son of the Sultan who afterwards succeeded him under the title of Sultan Muzaffar. Prince Khalil during his tenure of office founded the village called Khalilpur. The Sultan also installed Bhupatsingh, the son of the last Chudasama king, Mandalika III, in Junagadh as a &quot;jagirdar&quot; (feudal lord). The &quot;jagir&quot; allotted to Bhupatsingh was the Sil Bagasra Chovisi; and his descendants were known as Raizada. They continued to rule there. Bhupatsingh was succeeded by his son Khengar.

After the accession of Sultan Muzafar, and indeed during the latter part of Sultan Mahmud&#x27;s reign, the seat of government was moved from Junagadh to Diu owing to the importance of that island as a naval station and to check the ravages of the Portuguese. Tatarkhan Ghori was left at Junagadh by Malik Eiaz who himself resided at Diu. After the disgrace and death of Malik Eiaz, Tatarkhan Ghori became independent at Junagadh; and after the death of Sultan Bahadur, the Ghori family reigned independently at Junagadh, though still owing a nominal allegiance to the successive Sultans at Ahmadabad. This state of affairs continued until the first conquest of Gujarat by the Mughal emperor Akbar, when Aminkhan Ghori had succeeded his father Tatarkhan at Junagadh.

When the Portuguese took over the ports of Diu and Daman in the 16th century, a fifteen-foot cannon, made in Egypt in 1531, was abandoned by a Turkish admiral opposing the Portuguese forces at Diu, which is now at Uparkot Fort.

===Under the Mughal Empire===
;Ghori rule
In 1525, Khengar was succeeded by his son Noghan. Tatarkhan Ghori had now become almost independent. In his time Jam Raval conquered Halar and built Navanagar. In 1551, Noghan was succeeded by his son Shrisingh, who lived till 1586. During this time, Tatarkhan Ghori died and was succeeded by his son Aminkhan Ghori. In his time, Akbar conquered Gujarat, although Sorath remained independent under the Ghori rule. The exact date of Tatarkhan Ghori&#x27;s death is not known; but from the mention of Aminkhan as his successor, it must have been from about 1570 to 1575. On the return of Emperor Akbar to Agra in 1573, after the defeat and death of Muhammad Husain Mirzah and Ikhtiyar ul Mulk, he gave orders that Sorath should be conquered from Aminkhan Ghori. Vazir Khan attempted it but was unequal to the task. Great confusion existed now in Sorath. The Moghal conquest of Gujarat, the collapse of the power of the Gujarat Sultans, the encroachments of the Jam, and the assumption of independence by the Ghori all augmented the confusion afterwards increased by the escape of Sultan Muzaffar in 1583 and subsequent partisan warfare.

During these disturbances Amin Khan Ghori and his son Daulat Khan Ghori espoused the cause of Muzafar, as did the Jam and Loma Khuman of Kherdi. The exact date of Amin Khan Ghori&#x27;s death is not known but it was about 1589–90. Raizada Khengar also warmly espoused Mnzafar&#x27;s side. After the siege and capture of Junagadh in 1591–92 by Naurang Khan, Syad Kasim, and Gnjar Khan; Khengar was dismissed to his estate of Sil Bagasra, and the Raizada ceased to rule at Junagadh. Daulat Khan Ghori died of his wounds during the siege, and henceforth Junagadh became the seat of the imperial &quot;faujdar&quot;s (garrison commanders) of Sorath in subordination to the imperial viceroy at Ahmedabad.

;Imperial rule
The first &quot;faujdar&quot; of Junagad was Naurang Khan and, next, Syad Kasim. The most famous were (1) Mirzah Isa Tarkhan (2) Kutb ud din Kheshgi, and (3) Sardarkhan. Of these Mirzah Isa Tarkhan ruled Sorath from about 1633–34 to 1642, when he was appointed viceroy of Gujarat. On this occasion he left his son Inayat Ullah as &quot;faujdar&quot; at Junagadh while he himself conducted the government of Gujarat from its capital, Ahmedabad. In Mirzah Isa Tarkhan&#x27;s time the fortifications of Junagadh were entirely repaired. Kutb ud din was another &quot;faujdar&quot;, and his tenure of office lasted from about 1653 to 1666. In about 1664, he conquered Navanagar and annexed it to the imperial domain. Sardarkhan also distinguished himself as &quot;faujdar&quot; of Sorath, both by the firmness of his rule and by his construction (1681, AH 1092) of the &quot;Sardar Baug&quot; (palace) and excavation of the &quot;Sardar Talav&quot; (main gate). He built a mausoleum for himself in the Sardar Baug, but he died at Thatta, in Sindh, and is said to have been buried there and not at Junagadh. He was &quot;faujdar&quot; from about 1666 to 1686, but in 1670 he went for a short time to Idar and was replaced by Syad Dilerkhan. The last of the &quot;faujdar&quot; s was Sherkhan Babi, who became independent and assumed the title of Nawab Bahadur Khan.

===Junagadh state===


In 1730, Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat Subah, founded the state of Junagadh by declaring independence after the invasion by the Maratha Gaekwad dynasty. Babi founded the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh—who were Babi or Babai pashtuns from Afghanistan—conquered large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled for the next two centuries, first as tributaries of Marathas, and later under the suzerainty of the British, who granted the honor of a 13-gun salute.

* 1730–1758 – Mohammad Bahadur Khanji or Mohammad Sher khan Babi
* 1758–1774 – Mohammad Mahabat Khanji I
* 1774–1811 – Mohammad Hamid Khanji I
* 1811–1840 – Mohammad Bahadur Khanji II
* 1840–1851 – Mohammad Hamid Khanji II
* 1851–1882 – Mohammad Mahabat Khanji II
* 1882–1892 – Mohammad Bahadur Khanji III
* 1892–1911 – Mohammad Rasul Khanji
* 1911–1948 – Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III

====British period====
In 1807, Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818, but the Saurashtra area was never directly administered by the British, who instead divided the territory into more than one hundred princely states, which remained in existence until 1947. The present old-town, developed during the 19th and 20th centuries, constituted one of those princely states.

The Shri Swaminarayan Mandir temple in Junagadh was constructed on land presented by Jinabhai (Hemantsingh) Darbar of Panchala, and dedicated on 1 May 1828. Swaminarayan appointed Gunatitanand Swami as the first mahant (religious and administrative head of a temple), who served in this role and preached there for over 40 years.

====Accession by India====
During the period just before the independence and partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the 562 princely states that had existed outside British India, but under British suzerainty, were given the choice of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or to remaining apart. Although the states were theoretically free to choose, Earl Mountbatten stated that &quot;geographic compulsions&quot; meant that most of them would choose India. Mountbatten took the position that only states that shared a common border with Pakistan should choose to accede to it, but he had no power to impose this point of view on the states.

On 15 September 1947, Nawab Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III of Junagadh – which, although located at the south-western end of Gujarat, had no common border with Pakistan – chose to accede to Pakistan, ignoring Mountbatten&#x27;s views and arguing that Junagadh could access Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh — Mangrol and Babariawad — reacted by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the nawab&#x27;s forces militarily occupied the two states. Rulers of other neighbouring states reacted angrily, sent troops to the Junagadh frontier, and appealed to the government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhis, led by Samaldas Gandhi, formed a government-in-exile, the &quot;Aarzi Hukumat&quot; (&quot;temporary government&quot;).

India asserted that Junagadh was not contiguous to Pakistan and, believing that if Junagadh was permitted to accede to Pakistan communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, refused to accept the nawab&#x27;s accession to Pakistan. The Indian government pointed out that the state was 96% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession. India cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad, which had acceded to India.

Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes between Junagadhi and Indian troops.

On 7 November, Junagadh&#x27;s court, facing collapse, invited the government of India to take over the state&#x27;s administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the father of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, decided to invite the Government of India to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the regional commissioner of Saurashtra in the government of India to this effect.

The government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the dewan to intervene. A plebiscite was conducted in February 1948, but it was not internationally monitored. Pakistan&#x27;s claims were based on the logic of the Kashmir annexation, and not on the plebiscite, which went almost unanimously in favour of accession to India. Junagadh became a part of the Indian state of Saurashtra until 1 November 1956, when Saurashtra became part of Bombay state. In 1960, Bombay state was split into the linguistic states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, in which Junagadh was located.

In 2020, Pakistan&#x27;s government has maintained and revived its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map.

<text>The Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada () is the Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who served as the chief executive of Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD). The post was traditionally held by an MP from Western Canada, although occasionally the responsibilities were accorded to a more senior cabinet minister, such as the Industry minister.

As of November 4, 2015, WD, along with Canada&#x27;s other regional development agencies, is operated as part of the Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) portfolio, led by Minister Navdeep Bains.

Related regional development posts include Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, positions which have also been folded into ISED under Minister Bains.

On August 5, 2021, the Government of Canada announced that Western Economic Diversification would be divided into two new agencies—PacifiCan for BC; and PrairiesCan for Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.
