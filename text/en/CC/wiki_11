<text>&quot; Guinevere &quot; is a 1999 American drama film about the artistic and romantic relationship between a young student and her older mentor.

The film was written and directed by Audrey Wells (in her directorial debut) and stars Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley, Jean Smart, and Gina Gershon. The film was a 1999 Sundance Film Festival Jury Prize nominee. It won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for Wells&#x27; screenplay, which she tied with Frank Whaley&#x27;s script for &quot;Joe the King&quot;. It was also entered into the 21st Moscow International Film Festival.

==Plot==
Harper Sloane is a misfit in her snobbish, upper-class family of lawyers. She has just been accepted to Harvard Law School. At her sister&#x27;s wedding, after being sent out from her hiding place in the storage room with a bottle of champagne, she meets Connie Fitzpatrick, a bohemian photographer who takes an instant liking to her and nicknames her &quot;Guinevere&quot;. Her visit to his loft in order to pick up the wedding photographs soon blossoms into a full-blown affair, and Harper eventually moves in with Connie as he instructs her in the ways of art, in particular photography.

After a brutal confrontation with Harper&#x27;s mother, Deborah, and Harper&#x27;s discovery that Connie has a history of relationships with young women, the film comes to a climax in a downtrodden L.A. hotel where Connie ends the relationship by kicking out Harper. She returns only once, four years later, as he is dying from cirrhosis of the liver, and meets the other Guineveres he has had. On the rooftop, she describes her personal view of his kind of heaven, which she affectionately titles &quot;The Connie Special&quot;.

== Production ==
With the exception of some exterior shots in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, the film was mostly shot in Los Angeles.

== Reception ==
&quot;Guinevere&quot; received positive reviews, resulting an approval rating of 86% based on 35 reviews on the critics website Rotten Tomatoes.

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;This patient, perceptive, nonjudgmental love story about age difference is the first to convincingly explain the temporal physics of May-December romances. That writer-director Audrey Wells (who wrote &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;) promotes the feminine point of view makes this incisive romantic drama all the more valuable. It’s the truth about men and girls.&quot;

Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; opined the film is &quot;a quiet character drama that illustrates the fragility of early love and the pain of a trust betrayed. Don&#x27;t expect sitcom zingers, over mixed rock music or any other Hollywood youth-movie cliches -- this is a movie that disarms with its sincerity and frankness.&quot;

Much praise was given to Sarah Polley, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Polley in particular captures the full emotional range of a young woman trying on the mantle of a Guinevere.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Polley keeps the film and her character from falling into clichés.

Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; noted the film occasionally &quot;bogs down during several fuzzily romantic interludes&quot;, but &quot;the twist on this story makes for interesting viewing.&quot; She added, &quot;As with her screenplay for &quot;The Truth About Cats and Dogs&quot;, Wells takes some old clichés about the sexes (in &quot;Truth&quot;, it was the conflict between beautiful and plain-looking women) and turns them inside out.&quot;

<text>Red Production Company Limited is a British independent television production company owned by StudioCanal.

== Background ==
Red Production Company was formed in 1998 by Nicola Shindler, a television producer who had worked on &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; and &quot;Cracker&quot;. Red&#x27;s first production was the controversial drama &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, written by Russell T Davies and based on the lives of three gay men in the city. This was screened on Channel 4 in early 1999 and drew much comment and praise.

The same year, Red followed this up with another series for Channel 4, an anthology of six half-hour plays about love entitled &quot;Love in the 21st Century&quot;. &quot;Queer as Folk 2&quot; arrived in 2000, and since then Red has expanded to produce dramas for nearly all of the main British television channels. The company&#x27;s success led to an attempt by Granada Television – in whose Quay Street building the company rented offices – to buy it, but Shindler turned down their offer, wanting to retain control of her own company.

In 2013, Red moved into the MediaCityUK complex in Manchester.
RED is now based in offices at Ancoats since 2022, with CEO Patrick Schweitzer (previously from Tall Story Pictures) at the helm.

== Partnerships ==
In December 2013, it was announced that Shindler had sold a majority stake in Red to the French media company StudioCanal.

In 2015, it was announced that Shindler would provide creative guidance and management oversight to a new production company called Guilty Party, founded by the actor Simon Bird, Jonny Sweet, and Spencer Millman.

In 2016, Shindler went into business with author Harlan Coben to form the US-based production company, Final Twist Productions. Shindler is Co-CEO with Coben. StudioCanal will provide distribution services.

<text>Mölle is a locality situated in Höganäs Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 715 inhabitants in 2010.

It is best known for its scenic harbour and its location adjacent to the Kullaberg Nature Reserve. Its harbour, situated on the Kattegat Strait, provides services for marine fishing, watersports outings and tour excursions along the coast, especially the rocky shore of Kullaberg to the north. Fodor characterizes Mölle as &quot;a small town set in spectacular isolation on the dramatic headland of the Kulla Peninsula&quot;.

As a historic seaside resort, Mölle has hosted numerous technical and professional conferences such as: the Swedish Network of European Economists, Joint Swedish-Russian International Workshop on Information Theory; and the Royal Society (United Kingdom) of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

== Logistics ==
Mölle can be accessed from the north south coastal road 111, which effectively accesses Mölle from the south and terminates at Kullaberg, just north of Mölle. The nearest airport is approximately 19 kilometers distant at Ängelholm. Mölle is situated 35 kilometers northwest of Helsingborg. The nearest villages are Björkeröd and Kockenhus, each about two kilometers distant. The town itself is nestled on the steeply sloping hillside above the Kattegat Strait. Mölle’s official altitude is given as 16 meters, although the harbour and coastal area are of course essentially at sea level. The time zone there is UTC+1.

== Environmental factors ==
Mölle has a littoral zone habitat consisting of shingle beach and rocky shoreline; this ecosystem has a panoply of coastal wildflowers, lichens and mosses, as well as abundant birdlife. Surrounding the higher elevations of hillside Mölle are broadleaf deciduous forests of mixed oak and beech trees, which ecosystem graduates into the Kullaberg upper reaches. This habitat fosters a diverse upland flora and fauna, notably since the Kullaberg is listed as an Important Bird Area.

Air quality conditions at Mölle are excellent with little industry in the immediate vicinity and prevailing offshore breezes characterizing the air flow. Sound levels are quite low, ranging from 43 to 56 dBA, since there is only a modest use of motor vehicles within the town. Pedestrians comprise much of the trip taking within Mölle, especially due to the efficient footpaths that scale the hill, with only more indirect routes available for motor vehicles.

== The harbour ==
The harbour has been constructed from a rock jetty that further encloses a natural bay and provides slips for approximately 130 small and medium-sized boats. Mölle&#x27;s harbour is the economic and social center of the town, especially in summertime, when townspeople and visitors gravitate to the waterfront for walking, dining, shopping, socializing and engaging boats for day trips. In the warmest months swimmers can occasionally be seen in the cool waters of the harbour.

The harbour is also noteworthy because it commands a central position on the Kattegat Strait, one of the busiest parts of the Baltic Sea region. This strategic importance is magnified by the proximity of Mölle to the historic Kullen Lighthouse on the Kullaberg Peninsula, which is the brightest lighthouse in Sweden.

==History==
Mölle was a lively 19th century fishing village, some of whose stately buildings survive to the present. It was earlier and still is today an enclave of relatively affluent residents, who initially made their fortunes from fishing. There are extant two sizeable 19th century hotels, which are perched high above the harbour. Other historic buildings surviving are the 1910 Villa Italienborg, built by a scrap dealer whose architectural ideas derived from a visit to the Italian Riviera. Villa Africa is a two-story historical residence erected by a Mölle sea captain to woo his bride to move from South Africa.

In the latter part of the 19th century Mölle was renowned as a center for erotic entertainment, especially mixed sex bathing (considered marginally scandalous in that era); thus it attracted visitors from throughout Sweden as well as various parts of Europe. There was even a weekly train from Berlin to Mölle up until the First World War.

<text>Héctor Santiago-Colón (December 20, 1942 – June 28, 1968) is one of nine Puerto Ricans who have been posthumously presented with the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States. His actions on June 28, 1968, during the Vietnam War saved the lives of his comrades.

==Early years==
Santiago-Colón was one of twelve siblings born to Pablo Santiago and Petronila Colón in Salinas, Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. In 1960 his family moved to the mainland United States and lived in New York City. After living in the city for a short time, Santiago-Colón decided that he wanted to be part of the NYPD (New York City Police Department), however, at the time, in order to become a member of the NYPD you had to be a veteran. Santiago-Colon then volunteered to join the United States Army. He was engaged to be married to his elementary school sweetheart at the time. After completing his basic training, he was assigned to a unit stationed in the Republic of Vietnam.

==Action in Vietnam==

On June 28, 1968, members of Santiago-Colón&#x27;s Company B of the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division were engaged in combat in Quang Tri Province during Operation Jeb Stuart III. A North Vietnamese soldier threw a hand grenade into Santiago-Colón&#x27;s foxhole. Realizing that there was no time to throw out the grenade, he tucked it in to his stomach and turning away from his comrades, absorbed the full impact of the blast, sacrificing his life to save his fellow soldiers from certain death.

Santiago-Colón posthumously received the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his own life above and beyond the call of duty. The award was presented to his family in a ceremony at the White House by President Richard M. Nixon on April 7, 1970. His remains are buried in the city of Salinas, Puerto Rico.

==Medal of Honor citation==

Tillman was born in Los Angeles, California.

==Amateur career==

==Professional career==

Tillman turned pro in 1984 as a cruiserweight and had a disappointing professional career, primarily due to a weak chin. In 1986, he was knocked down twice and upset by Bert Cooper via a decision. In 1987 he secured a bout at WBA Cruiserweight Title holder Evander Holyfield. Holyfield dropped Tillman three times en route to a 7th-round TKO, according to WBA rules. Tillman later lost to Willie DeWitt in a rematch of their 1984 Heavyweight Olympic Final bout. In 1990, he took on Mike Tyson in Tyson&#x27;s comeback bout after his loss to James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas. Tyson knocked him out in the first round. He finished his professional career with a record of 25-6-0 with 16 knockouts.

In the movie Rocky V, Tillman played contender &quot;Tim Simms&quot; who lost a bout to &quot;Tommy Gunn&quot; played by Tommy Morrison.

==Personal life==
At the 1984 Summer Olympics Henry met his bride-to-be Gina Hemphill, a granddaughter of Jesse Owens, she carried the torch into the Los Angeles Coliseum at the opening ceremony, and worked as a production assistant on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in Chicago. In 1987 they were married among friends and Olympic teammates.

==Legal issues==
In February 2001, Tillman was sentenced to six years in prison for a 1996, attempted murder and voluntary manslaughter charge, and released from custody in 2002. In July 2004, Tillman was sentenced to 37 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal identity theft charges.

<text>Ho Man Tin is a mostly residential area in Kowloon, Hong Kong, part of the Kowloon City District.

==History==

Section of lists of villages in the book &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;The History of Xin&#x27;an County&quot;) published in twenty fourth year of Jiaqing era (A.D. 1819) did not have any record of Ho Man Tin. 

The original Ho Man Tin was quite different from today&#x27;s Ho Man Tin. It was located in the heart of nowaday Mong Kok. With cultivated lands, it was surrounded in the north by Argyle Street, west by Coronation Road (present-day Nathan Road), and east by Quarry Hill, No. 12 Hill and Tai Shek Kwu (present-day Kadoorie Hill). Southeast from its original location is Fo Pang and to the south Mong Kok. Streams from those hills in the east offered water for cultivation, the latter reflected in the area&#x27;s name last Chinese character, i.e. &quot;tin&quot;, , which means field. The &quot;Ho&quot; () and &quot;Man&quot; () part of the name are both Chinese surnames; so Ho Man Tin represents the agricultural land owned by the &quot;Ho&quot; and &quot;Man&quot;, the major families who took their residence around the area.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Ho Man Tin was 470. The number of males was 272.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the eastern hills to the original site of Ho Man Tin became a resettlement area for refugees from China, the city building there the Ho Man Tin Estate, which gave the name Ho Man Tin to that section of the hills, thus shifting away name-wise from the original flat fields. The present-day Ho Man Tin is close to Argyle Street and Kowloon Hospital. The area is within the district of the Kowloon City police station.

Today, Ho Man Tin is home to many public housing estates as well as the headquarters of the Housing Authority. Oi Man Estate was on the itinerary of Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Hong Kong in 1975.

Ho Man Tin is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 34. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and two government schools: Farm Road Government Primary School (農圃道官立小學) and Ma Tau Chung Government Primary School (馬頭涌官立小學).

==Transport==
Princess Margaret Road, Waterloo Road, Argyle Street and Pui Ching Road act as the main arteries of the Ho Man Tin area, and it is conveniently served by public buses.

Despite the name, Ho Man Tin station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is not located in Ho Man Tin proper but in the lesser known area Lo Lung Hang instead. The central part of Ho Man Tin between Argyle Street and Waterloo Road is in fact more than away on foot. This led to a debate on its naming circa the station&#x27;s opening.
The closest station to Ho Man Tin proper is actually Mong Kok East on the East Rail line.

<doc id="847605" wikidata="Q4806139" url="?curid=847605" title="Ashutosh Mukherjee">
<text>Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee (anglicised, originally Asutosh Mukhopadhyay, also anglicised to Asutosh Mookerjee) (29 June 1864 – 25 May 1924) was a Bengali mathematician, lawyer, jurist, judge, educator, and institution builder. A unique figure in Indian history, he made major contributions in three fields - mathematics, law, and higher education.

A holder of Masters degrees in both Mathematics and Natural Sciences, he was one of the first Indians to publish research papers in British journals. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh at the age of 22, and was a Fellow or Member of various learned bodies in Europe and the United States.

Mukherjee passed his law examination and built a successful law practice. He received an LL.D. and gave lectures on law at the university. He became a judge of the Calcutta High Court, and acted as a Chief Justice for couple of years. He established the University College of Law at the university. 

&quot;It was his ambition that Calcutta should become a centre of learning and research,&quot; noted his obituary in &quot;Nature&quot; (1924). As the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta (1906–1914 and 1921–23), Mukherjee transformed an examination conducting, degree granting body into one of Asia&#x27;s top research universities. He started new departments for post graduate study in various disciplines, raised funds to create new chaired professorships and build facilities, hired outstanding professors in diverse fields of study (including Asia&#x27;s first Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir C.V. Raman), and supported graduated students in their efforts to pursue advanced research.

Mukherjee was the president of the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress (1914). He played a major role in the foundation of the &quot;Bengal Technical Institute&quot; (1906), which later became Jadavpur University. He founded the Calcutta Mathematical Society (1908). The Ashutosh College was also founded under his stewardship in 1916.

He is often called &quot;Banglar Bagh&quot; (&#x27;The Bengal Tiger&#x27;) for his high self-esteem, courage and academic integrity. According to historian D. R. Bhandarkar, the epithet &#x27;Vikramaditya&#x27; is also ascribed to Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee.

==Early life and family ==
Ashutosh Mukherjee was born on 29 June 1864 at Bowbazar, Calcutta (today&#x27;s Kolkata) in a Hindu Brahmin family. His mother was Jagattarini Devi and father Dr. Ganga Prasad Mukhopadhyaya. His ancestral town was Jirat in Hooghly District, West Bengal. Among his ancestors were several distinguished Sanskrit scholars, including Pandit Ramchandra Tarkalankar, a professor of &quot;nyaya&quot; who had been appointed by Warren Hastings to that chair at the Sanskrit College in Kolkata. 

Mukherjee&#x27;s grandfather came to Jirat from another village named Digsui, situated also in the Hooghly District and settled down there. Father Ganga Prasad Mukherjee was born in Jirat on 16 December 1836. He came to Kolkata to study in Medical College with the help of the wealthy people of Jirat. Later he settled down in Bhawanipore area of Kolkata. He became a well-known doctor and founded the South Sub Urban School in Calcutta.

Ganga Prasad took particular care of his son&#x27;s education. Brought up in an atmosphere of science and literature at home, young Ashutosh went to the Sisu Vidayalaya at Chakraberia, Bhowanipore and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. When he was young, he met Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who was a major influence on him. He was a student of Madhusudan Das.

In November 1879, at the age of fifteen, Mukherjee passed the entrance exam of the Calcutta University in which he stood second and received a first grade scholarship. In the year 1880, he took admission at the Presidency College (now Presidency University) in Kolkata where he met P.C. Ray and Narendranath Dutta who would later become famous as Swami Vivekananda. In 1883, Mukherjee topped the BA examination at Calcutta University to complete a postgraduate degree in mathematics. He was awarded the prestigious Premchand Roychand Fellowship in Mathematics and Physics, Pure and Applied. 

In 1883 Surendranath Banerjee wrote an article in the newspaper &quot;Bengalee&quot; against the orders of the Calcutta High Court and he was arrested in contempt of court. Protests and &quot;hartals&quot; erupted across Bengal and other cities, led by a group of students headed by Mukherjee at Calcutta high court. 

In 1884, he won the Harishchandra Prize for academic achievements, and completed an M.A. with first-class honours in mathematics in 1885. In 1885, he married Jogamaya Devi Bhattacharyya. In 1886, he was awarded a second Masters in Natural Sciences, making him the first student to be awarded a dual degree from Calcutta University. 

Next, Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee pursued a career in law. He received a Bachelor of Law degree in 1888 and enrolled as a &quot;vakil&quot; of the Calcutta High Court. In 1897, he received an LL.D. and became the Tagore Professor of Law at the University of Calcutta. In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the High Court, and subsequently served as its acting Chief Justice for a couple of years.

==The young mathematician==
In 1880, though only a first-year undergraduate, he published his first mathematical paper, on a new proof of the 25th proposition of Euclid&#x27;s first book. His third mathematical paper (1886), &quot;A Note on Elliptic Functions&quot; was praised by the distinguished British mathematician and Arthur Cayley as a contribution of &quot;outstanding merit.&quot; He determined several crucial derivations of Gaspare Mainardi&#x27;s answer to determining the oblique trajectory of a system of confocal ellipses. He also made lasting contributions in differential geometry, developing analytical methods of simplifying Gaspard Monge&#x27;s interpretation of his general differential equation for conics.

He became a Fellow or Member of various learned bodies in Europe and the United States. He became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society at the age of 21, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) when he was 22. By 1888, Mukherjee was a lecturer in mathematics for the recently established Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS).

Mukherjee continued publishing scholarly papers on mathematics and physics into his 30s. By 1893, aged 29, Mukherjee had been further elected to the fellowships of the Physical Society of France and the Mathematical Society of Palermo, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He subsequently became a member of the London Mathematical Society, the Paris Mathematical Society and the American Mathematical Society (1900). Although after 1893 he largely abandoned his mathematical pursuits for a legal career, Mukherjee has been recognised as the first modern Indian mathematician to enter the field of mathematical research. He also the Calcutta Mathematical Society (1908) and served as its president (1908 – 1923).

==Lawyer, jurist, and justice==

At the age of 24, Mukherjee became a Fellow of the Calcutta University. Turning down a job offer in the Department of Public Instruction in order to complete his Bachelor of Law degree, he received his degree in 1888 and enrolled as a &quot;vakil&quot; of the Calcutta High Court. He received a Doctor of Law degree (LL.D.) in 1897. 

Jurist, and author V. Sudhish Pai notes: &quot;Mukherjee built a highly successful career with a combination of intellect and industry. He was appointed the Tagore Law Professor at Calcutta University in 1898 and authored the book, The Law of Perpetuities in British India, in 1902—still considered the polestar on the eastern horizon of jurisprudence. He was appointed a judge of the Calcutta High Court in June 1904. His appointment and tenure on the Bench significantly expanded judicial discourse. He brought to bear on his work inexhaustible energy, great erudition and the integrity of scholarship. His learning was vast and his exposition of law complete. Former Chief Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah placed him amongst the six most eminent judges India has produced.&quot;

When Mukherjee became a judge at the age of forty, &quot;his senior colleague Justice Rampini told Asutosh that his enthusiasm would perhaps abate with advancing years. Asutosh had said in reply that he would not be justified in continuing as a Judge should his enthusiasm for doing justice diminish or his capacity for work decline.&quot;

Mukherjee served as Calcutta High Court&#x27;s acting Chief Justice on couple of occasions. He stepped down in 1924 after twenty years of service and restarted his law practice. 

==Vice-chancellor and institution builder==
The first modern universities in Asia were established in 1857 in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. However, they were modeled after the University of London and set up as affiliating universities that merely conducted examinations and granted degrees to students who were taught in affiliated colleges. Two other universities set up in 19th century British India, the universities of Punjab and Allahabad, operated in a similar way.

Viceroy of India Lord Curzon&#x27;s education mission in 1902 identified the universities including the Calcutta University, as centres of sedition where young people formed networks of resistance to colonial domination. The cause of this was thought to be the unwise granting of autonomy to these universities in the nineteenth century. Thus in the period of 1905 to 1935, the colonial administration tried to reinstate government control of education. Despite these strained circumstances, Mukherjee went on to create a culture of academic excellence and built a superb research university.

He was involved in the University of Calcutta&#x27;s affairs throughout his life. From the age of 25, he was a member of its Syndicate, serving on the University Senate and Syndicate for the next 16 years. He served as President of the Board of Studies in Mathematics for 11 years, and represented his university in the Bengal Legislative Council from 1899 to 1903. But the real opportunity came in 1906.

Mukherjee served as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta from 1906 to 1914 and again from 1921 to 1923. He declared in the 1907 convocation address: &quot;From now on the University is not just an institution issuing certificates, nor is it even a conglomeration of colleges... This will be a centre of learning and the expansion of the frontiers of knowledge. This is precisely the true ideal of the university.&quot; 

He started departments for postgraduate study in various disciplines. He set up several new academic graduate programs at the Calcutta University: comparative literature, anthropology, applied psychology, industrial chemistry, ancient Indian history and culture as well as Islamic culture. He also made arrangements for postgraduate teaching and research in Bengali, Hindi, Pali and Sanskrit. He raised funds to create new chairs and build facilities. Vice chancellors of other Indian universities followed many of his moves.

Scholars from all over India, irrespective of race, caste, and gender, came to teach and study there. He even persuaded European scholars to teach at his university. Eminent academics hired during his time included: 

* Asia&#x27;s first Nobel Prize winning scientist, discoverer of Raman Effect, physicist Sir C.V. Raman, FRS
* Botanists S.P. Agharkar and Paul J. Brühl
* Chemists Sir J.C. Ghosh, J.N. Mukherjee, and Sir P. C. Ray, FRSE,
* Geologists E. W. Vredenburg
* Historians R. C. Majumdar and H.C. Raychaudhuri,
* Indologist and orientalists D.R. Bhandarkar and George Thibaut,
* Jurists Radhabinod Pal and Sir Abdur Rahim
* Language and Literature scholars Nalinaksha Dutt and Dinesh Chandra Sen, 
* Linguists S.K. Chatterji, Harinath De, Otto Strauss, and I.J.S Taraporewala
* Mathematicians Ganesh Prasad, N.R. Sen, and W.H. Young
* Philosophers Sir B. N. Seal and Sir S. Radhakrishnan, 
* Physicists D.M. Bose, S.N. Bose, S.K. Mitra, B.B. Ray and Meghnad Saha (developed Saha ionization equation), 

He supported graduated students in their efforts to pursue advanced research. Graduates of the university at this time included Satyendra Nath Bose of the Bose–Einstein Statistics fame (after whom fundamental particles &quot;bosons&quot; are named), Meghnad Saha who developed the &quot;Saha Ionization Equation,&quot; and renowned radio physicist Sisir Kuma Mitra who pioneered space research in India - all three became Fellows of the Royal Society (FRS).

Mukherjee&#x27;s institution building activities included establishing the University College of Science (Rajabazar Science College) and the University College of Law. He also founded Asutosh College in South Kolkata in 1916. He laid the foundry stone of Jagadbandhu Institution in 1914 and Santragachi Kedarnath Institution in 1925.

The French scholar Sylvain Lévi commented :

==Later life and death==

In 1910, he was appointed the president of the Imperial (now National) Library Council to which he donated his personal collection of 80,000 books which are arranged in a separate section. He was the president of the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress in 1914. Mukherjee was a member of the 1917–1919 Sadler Commission, presided over by Michael Ernest Sadler, which inquired into the state of Indian education. He was thrice elected as the president of The Asiatic Society. Having served as a fellow and subsequently as a vice-president of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science since the 1890s, in 1922 he was elected President of the IACS and held the office until his death.

After serving five terms as vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, Mukherjee declined to be reappointed to a sixth term in 1923 when the university&#x27;s chancellor, Governor of Bengal the Earl of Lytton, tried to impose conditions on his reappointment. Shortly thereafter, he also resigned his judgeship on the Calcutta High Court and resumed his private practice of law. While arguing a case in Patna the following year, Mukherjee died suddenly on 25 May 1924, at age 59. His body was returned to Kolkata and cremated at a funeral service which drew crowds of mourners.

==Personal life==
Mukherjee married Jogamaya Devi Bhattacharyya (1871–16 July 1958) in 1885. The couple had seven children, Kamala (born 1895), Rama Prasad (1896–1983), Syama Prasad (1901–1953), Uma Prasad (1902–1997), Amala (born 1905), Bama Prasad (born 1906) and Ramala (born 1908). 

His oldest son Rama Prasad became a judge in the High Court of Calcutta. Second son Syama Prasad Mookerjee was a lawyer, educationist, and a political activist; he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the direct precursor to the modern Bharatiya Janata Party. Uma Prasad became famed as a Himalayan trekker and a travel writer - being awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for his travelogue &quot;Manimahesh&quot;. His grandson Chittatosh Mookerjee was the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court and the High Court of Bombay. The Mookerjee family became the first to produce three generations of justices in an Indian high court.

==Recognition and legacy==
Mukherjee was a polyglot learned in Pali, French and Russian. Apart from his fellowships and memberships in several international academic bodies, he was recognised by an award of the title of &quot;Saraswati&quot; in 1910 from &quot;pandits&quot; in Nabadwip, followed by that of &quot;Shastravachaspati&quot; in 1912 from the Dhaka Saraswat Samaj, &quot;Sambudhagama Chakravarty&quot; in 1914 and &quot;Bharat Martanda&quot; in 1920. Mukherjee was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) in June 1909, and knighted in December 1911.

In his lifetime, he was appointed to numerous academic societies:
*Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS, 1885)
*Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE, 1886; Member: 1885)
*Member of the Bedford Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching (1886)
*Fellow of the Physical Society of London (FPSL, 1887)
*Fellow of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society (1888)
*Membre de la &quot;Société mathématique de France&quot; (1888)
*Member of the &quot;Circolo Matematico di Palermo&quot; (1890)
*Membre de la &quot;Société française de physique&quot; (1890)
*Member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA, 1893)
*Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (AMS, 1900)

The Government of India issued a stamp in 1964 to commemorate Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee for his contribution to education.

The epitaph beneath his marble bust at the Asutosh Museum of Indian Art at the University of Calcutta reads:

<doc id="847607" wikidata="Q1369321" url="?curid=847607" title="Hoodoo Gurus">
<text>Hoodoo Gurus are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1981 by Dave Faulkner (songwriter, lead singer and guitarist) and later joined by Richard Grossman (bass), Mark Kingsmill (drums), and Brad Shepherd (guitar, vocals, harmonica). Their popularity peaked in the mid- to late 1980s with albums &quot;Mars Needs Guitars!&quot;, &quot;Blow Your Cool!&quot; and &quot;Magnum Cum Louder&quot;.

Hoodoo Gurus had a string of pop-rock singles including &quot;Leilani&quot; (1982), &quot;Tojo&quot; (1983), &quot;My Girl&quot; (1983), &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1984), &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, &quot;Like Wow – Wipeout&quot; (1985), and &quot;What&#x27;s My Scene?&quot; (1987). After touring the United States from 1984 onward they gained popularity on the U.S. college rock circuit with the singles &quot;Come Anytime&quot; (1989) reaching no. 1 and &quot;Miss Freelove &#x27;69&quot; (1991) reaching No. 3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; biggest Australian single was their 1987 top-3 song &quot;What&#x27;s My Scene?&quot;. The song was parodied for the National Rugby League 2000s theme &quot;That&#x27;s My Team&quot;.

The Hoodoo Gurus were inducted into the Australia&#x27;s 2007 ARIA Hall of Fame. The band&#x27;s induction announcement stated that the Gurus were one of the most &quot;inventive, lyrically smart and exciting&quot; bands from Australia. From 1960s power pop and garage punk to hard rock and funky psychedelic kitsch, the group&#x27;s music stood out from Sydney&#x27;s Detroit-inspired bands.

==History==
=== 1981–1983: Formation ===
Three Hoodoo Gurus founders were from Perth protopunk and punk bands: Dave Faulkner (guitar) of The Legendary Manikins, who left after a fallout with frontman Robbie Porritt, James Baker (drums) of The Victims, who had also been with Roddy Radalj (aka Roddy Ray&#x27;Da) (guitars) in The Scientists, and the third founding member, Kimble Rendall (guitars) was formerly in Sydney punk rockers XL Capris. The three guitarists Faulkner, Rendall and Radalj met at an end-of-1980 New Year&#x27;s Eve party and were joined by Baker to form Le Hoodoo Gurus.

Le Hoodoo Gurus unorthodox line-up of three guitars and no bass player, fused pop melodies, punk guitars and an American trash culture ethic. This was captured on their first single, &quot;Leilani&quot;, released in October 1982, on Phantom Records. This told the story of a maiden sacrificed to the gods and an erupting volcano while her true love looked on helplessly. They dropped the &#x27;Le&#x27;, to become Hoodoo Gurus, not long after the single&#x27;s release. As the Hoodoo Gurus, they gave their first ever performance on a segment of the kids&#x27; TV program &quot;Simon Townsend&#x27;s Wonder World&quot;; this was followed by a performance alongside a man and his singing dog, on &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;.

Rendall left in 1982 before the release of &quot;Leilani&quot;, and went on to become a music video and film director. Rendall was second unit director on the latter two Matrix films, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, as well as &quot;I, Robot&quot;. Rendall also directed the slasher film, &quot;Cut&quot; in 2000. Rendall was effectively replaced by Clyde Bramley (bass guitar, backing vocals) from Sydney bands The Hitmen and Super K.

Radalj was not happy with Rendall&#x27;s leaving or Faulkner&#x27;s greater influence and left the Gurus. He was replaced by ex-Fun Things guitarist Brad Shepherd, who had been Bramley&#x27;s flatmate. Bramley and Shepherd had both been in The Hitmen and Super K. Faulkner wrote &quot;I Want You Back&quot; in response to Radalj&#x27;s public dissatisfaction with the Gurus. Radalj went on to perform with a number of other acts, including The Johnnys, Love Rodeo, The Dubrovniks and Roddy Ray&#x27;Da &amp; the Surfin&#x27; Caesars. As Roddy Ray&#x27;Da, he released &quot;Lost, Lonely and Vicious&quot; in 1990, &quot;Orgazmatazz&quot; a year later and &quot;Mouthful of Chicken&quot; in 1993.

===1983–1984: &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot;===

Gurus new line-up (Baker, Bramley, Faulkner and Shepherd) recorded the band&#x27;s first album in 1984, &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot;. The title came from a 1955 Three Stooges short &quot;Stone Age Romeos&quot;. The album was dedicated to characters from &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;F-Troop&quot; and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. They were awarded &#x27;Best Debut Album&#x27; of 1984 at the July 1985 &quot;Countdown&quot; Music Awards. When &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; was released in America it stayed at number 1 in the Alternative/College charts for seven weeks, becoming one of the most played albums for the year on the college network.

Initially a cult inner-city act, their popularity expanded due to regular airplay on radio station Triple J and nationwide pop TV show &quot;Countdown&quot; from mid-1983. Their breakthrough single &quot;My Girl&quot; was accompanied by a video clip featuring a dog trainer with his once champion greyhound. Members of Spiderbait described seeing the video for the first time as &quot;a beautiful, classic pop song&quot;. Some viewers insisted the song was &quot;written about a dog&quot;. This was closely followed by &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, which featured animated plastic model dinosaurs. Both videos were aired frequently raising the group&#x27;s profile around the country.

Original drummer James Baker was sacked from the band in August 1984 and was replaced by Mark Kingsmill (The Hitmen, New Christs, Screaming Tribesmen, Hellcats and Super K). Based on the success of &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; the Hoodoo Gurus, with their new drummer, then embarked on their first tour of the United States in late 1984.

===1985–1993: &quot;From Mars&quot; to &quot;Kinky&quot; ===
Following the US tour the Hoodoo Gurus went into the studio and recorded their second album, &quot;Mars Needs Guitars!&quot; (1985). The title was a twist on a Sci Fi B movie titled &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, had a more subdued regular-looking video. The Hoodoo Gurus played Europe and the United States including sell-out shows at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Palais and a two-month tour as special guests with The Bangles.

Baker&#x27;s firing upset some fans and critics. Despite subsequent fan speculation about the single &quot;Poison Pen”, songwriter Faulkner said it was not about band issues but rather about a relationship that had turned bitter. Baker had been involved with The Beasts of Bourbon as a side project from 1983 and now concentrated on their 1984 album &quot;The Axeman&#x27;s Jazz&quot;, subsequently he founded James Baker Experience and The Dubrovniks (latter two included Radalj), Novakill and eventually The Painkillers.

Gurus&#x27; peak of popularity was in the mid-to-late 1980s with the albums &quot;Mars Needs Guitars!&quot;, &quot;Blow Your Cool!&quot; and &quot;Magnum Cum Louder&quot;. The albums reached no. 140 (1986), no. 120 (1987) and no. 101 (1989) on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts respectively. The band&#x27;s 1987 &#x27;Blow Your Cool&#x27; concert tour took them to 19 countries playing 204 venues. A concert from the Ritz in New York City was broadcast by MTV America. The &#x27;Magnum Cum Louder&#x27; tour in 1990, with dates in Europe, America and Australasia; included Japan for the first time. Based on their extensive touring of America, the band gained a solid following in the U.S. with regular exposure on US college radio (and later MTV&#x27;s 120 Minutes) and even developed a big fan base in Brazil. The third album &quot;Blow Your Cool!&quot; let go of some of the peripheral quirkiness and just concentrated on the band&#x27;s pop power. Members of their international peer group The Bangles and Dream Syndicate contributed backing vocals to some songs. Then, Hoodoo Gurus decided to opt out of its record contract, tying up the group in legal wranglings for more than a year. In 1988 Richard Grossman (ex Matt Finish, Divinyls) replaced Clyde Bramley on bass. The most stable line-up of Faulkner, Grossman, Kingsmill, and Shepherd saw Hoodoo Gurus from 1988 to the break-up in January 1998.

After two albums under their new contract, &quot;Magnum Cum Louder&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Kinky&quot;, which reached no. 101 and 172 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts respectively the band then released in 1992 two compilations at once, &quot;Electric Soup&quot;, which contained the band&#x27;s hits and &quot;Gorilla Biscuit&quot;, which was made up of B-sides and rarities.

&quot;Kinky&quot; provided the single &quot;Miss Freelove &#x27;69&quot; which reached no. 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and no. 3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1991. Another single of the same year &quot;1000 Miles Away&quot; reached no. 37 in Australia. It was adopted by the crew of Royal Australian Navy frigate HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; as its unofficial anthem in 1993, playing it whenever its ships left port. Hoodoo Gurus played a concert, including &quot;1000 Miles Away&quot;, on-board HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; during its last voyage prior to decommissioning in 2005.

=== Crank through to the Bullet (1994–1998) ===
They followed &quot;Kinky&quot; with &quot;Crank&quot; in 1994. The &#x27;Crank&#x27; world tour took the Gurus through USA, Canada, Europe and included a one-month tour of Brazil. Faulkner also composed the soundtrack to Laurie McInnes&#x27; 1994 feature film &quot;Broken Highway&quot;. In 1995, the Gurus collaborated with The Masters Apprentices frontman Jim Keays on an updated rendition of &quot;Turn Up Your Radio&quot;. The song was included on a new Masters&#x27; Best of album, as well as being issued as a single.

In 1996 they moved to Mushroom Records for the release of their next album, &quot;Blue Cave&quot;. The band then undertook a national tour of Australian tour with US outfit The Posies and local band Drop City. Touring commitments were curtailed when Kingsmill severed tendons and nerves in his arm as a result of an onstage accident. Once Kingsmill recovered, the Gurus completed their &#x27;Circus Maximus&#x27; Australian tour by end of 1996. In January 1997, Faulkner announced that the band would be breaking up in December. March saw the Gurus undertake another tour of Brazil, where they played a concert in front of 40,000 people. The Gurus commenced their final Australian tour, the three-month &#x27;Spit the Dummy&#x27; tour, in October 1997. The tour coincided with the release of the double compilation album &quot;Armchair Gurus&quot;/&quot;Electric Chair&quot;, which made no. 29 on the national chart. The band played its final show in Melbourne on 11 January 1998. The show made up for dates missed during December 1997, when Faulkner was ill.

In November 1998 Mushroom issued the Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; live album, &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot;. The songs had been recorded during the band&#x27;s &#x27;Spit the Dummy&#x27; farewell tour. The standard, single album version was joined by a limited edition, triple CD version subtitled &quot;Director’s Cut&quot;. It included the additional CDs, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (a collection of live-to-air Broadcasts from between 1983 and 1996) and &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot; (a collection of outtakes and oddities).

Although Hoodoo Gurus officially split in 1998 they signed with Acadia Records, who released the band&#x27;s career-spanning compilation &quot;Ampology&quot; in October 2000.

===1998–2003: Hoodoo hiatus – side projects and solo work ===
====Grossman====
From 1990 onwards, Grossman has been involved in a side project, Ghostwriters, with Rob Hirst from Midnight Oil. Ghostwriters have released four albums with 2007&#x27;s &quot;Political Animal&quot; on Sony BMG. Shepherd had played with Ghostwriters on their albums &quot;Ghostwriters&quot; in 1991 and &quot;Fibromoon&quot; in 1999. During 2001, Grossman performed 20 concerts with long-time friend Matt Moffitt (1956–2003) singer-songwriter and founder of Matt Finish. Grossman had been an early member of Matt Finish, he returned to perform and record &quot;Just a Short Note (Best of)&quot; released in December 2001. The Kelly Gang was a 2004 project Grossman formed with Jack Nolan, they brought in Hirst and Scott Aplin (Waikiki) to record &quot;Looking for the Sun&quot;; Shepherd performed as a session musician.

====Shepherd====

Shepherd was briefly involved with Beasts of Bourbon alongside fellow Guru, James Baker. He recorded their four-track CD, &quot;From the Belly of the Beasts&quot;, a live 1984 performance at the Trade Union Club, Sydney. Shepherd&#x27;s tenure with Beasts ended after Baker was sacked from the Gurus. He joined another ex-Guru, Roddy Radalj, in Roddy Ray&#x27;Da and the Surfin&#x27; Caesars during 1989.
In 1999, following Gurus break-up, Shepherd recorded &quot;Alex Chilton&quot; for The Replacements tribute album, &quot;I&#x27;m in Love... With That Song&quot; (Antfarm Records). He also produced Shutterspeed&#x27;s debut 1999 EP, &quot;Up Go The Shutters&quot; and co-produced their second EP, &quot;Well Ain&#x27;t That Something A Good Thing&#x27;s Comin&#x27; &quot; on Laughing Outlaw Records. Shepherd went on to form a new band, The Monarchs (initially known as The Honkies), together with Andy Kelly on bass (Glide), Greg Hitchcock on guitar (The Neptunes, The Kryptonics, New Christs, The Verys, Challenger 7, You Am I, The Dearhunters) and his brother Murray Shepherd (Harpoon, The Fun Things, Screaming Tribesmen) on drums. The Monarchs played with The Meanies, Even, You Am I, Joe Strummer and The Hellacopters. In August 1999 The Monarchs recorded a self-financed album with Wayne Connolly and in 2000 they released their first single, &quot;2001&quot; b/w &quot;This Is All I Can Do&quot; (Ivy League Records); this was followed by their debut album, &quot;Make Yer Own Fun&quot;, in October 2001, on Shock Records.

====Faulkner====
Antenna was Faulkner&#x27;s side project (1998–1999) collaborating with long-time friend Kim Salmon (The Cheap Nasties, The Manikins, The Scientists, Beasts of Bourbon), also in Antenna were Justin Frew and Stuart McCarthy (both of Southend). Antenna recorded an album mid-1998, and then made its live debut at the Telstra Concert of the Century/Mushroom 25th anniversary in November 1998. The concert coincided with the release of the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Come on Spring&quot;, and album, &quot;Installation&quot;. Guest performers on the album included Matt Thomas (The Mavis&#x27;s) on &quot;All Rise&quot;, and Christina Amphlett (Divinyls) on &quot;Divine&quot;. &quot;Come on Spring&quot; reaching no. 64 on the 1998 Triple J Hottest 100 list. Antenna appeared on the 1999 Big Day Out tour but disbanded soon after.

Faulkner also wrote original music for the films &quot;Broken Highway&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Sum of Us&quot; (1994) starring Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson. Faulkner was one of the new entries in the 2007 edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot;.

====Persian Rugs====
In September 2001, the four ex-Gurus (Faulkner, Grossman, Kingsmill &amp; Shepherd) performed as The Moops and were later called Persian Rugs. At Homebake 2001, (8 December) both Hoodoo Gurus and Persian Rugs performed separate sets. Persian Rugs recorded a five-track EP &quot;Mr. Tripper&quot; in June 2002, Grossman then left, and Shepherd recommended bassist Kendall James as his replacement (ex Thurston Howlers, Crusaders). With James, the Persian Rugs recorded their debut album &quot;Turkish Delight&quot;, released in August 2003.

Persian Rugs provided the track &quot;Be My Guru&quot; for the Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; tribute album &quot;Stoneage Cameos&quot; (2005) (see &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot;) and by that time Hoodoo Gurus, with Grossman on bass, had already reformed.

=== 2003–2012: Regroup and ARIA Hall of Fame ===

By early 2003 Hoodoo Gurus had re-formed to record &quot;That&#x27;s My Team&quot; as the promotional theme for the National Rugby League between 2003 and 2007 (a CD was released September 2003 – see &quot;What&#x27;s My Scene?&quot;) with all profits donated to breast cancer charities. The original film clip of &quot;What&#x27;s My Scene?&quot; included shots of band members in Wests and Cronulla jumpers.

On 17 November 2003 EMI Records announced Hoodoo Gurus&#x27; reformation to record a new album, &quot;Mach Schau&quot;; they also released the track &quot;White Night&quot; as a radio-only single. In January 2004 the band co-headlined the annual Big Day Out festival with Metallica and The Strokes. &quot;Proudly Australian – celebrate Australia Day 2004&quot; which included &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changing My Life&quot; by Hoodoo Gurus was a four-track give-away CD. &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changing My Life&quot; (February 2004) was released as a single with &quot;Mach Schau&quot; following in March. The &#x27;Mach Schau&#x27; tour started in Perth late in March and was joined by Spiderbait from April to June. EMI reissued expanded/remastered editions of all Hoodoo Gurus albums (from February 2005); also released was &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; (2005), a two-DVD set compiling every Gurus&#x27; video, never-before-seen live material and a retrospective documentary, &quot;Be My Guru&quot;.

The band performed at the 2006 NRL Grand Final.

In 2007, Hoodoo Gurus was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. The band were inducted by HG Nelson of Triple J&#x27;s &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;. They performed &quot;The Right Time&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot; at the ceremony and subsequently toured with fellow inductees Radio Birdman.
The citation for the band&#x27;s nomination includes: 

Hoodoo Gurus toured during 2007 including several US dates, kicking off at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Music Festival in Austin, Texas (see SXSW photo above), performances in Europe, including the Azkena Festival (Spain). This was followed by a national tour of Australia called &#x27;Clash of the Titans&#x27; with The Stems and Radio Birdman. Their tour poster depicts the three bands as &#x27;Heavyweights&#x27; of the Australian music scene. Another solo tour started late in 2007 (including performances at the Apollo Bay Music Festival, Splendour in the Grass, Meredith Music Festival, and the St Kilda Festival) and continued into 2008. There are tentative plans to release a new album in 2009, although little material has been written so far. In June 2008 The Age newspaper commemorated 50 years of Australian rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll (the anniversary of the release of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s &quot;Wild One&quot;) by selecting the Top 50 Australian Albums, with &quot;Stoneage Romeo&quot; coming in at no. 5 on the list. The Hoodoo Gurus performed at the Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom on 29 June 2008.

Hoodoo Gurus performed on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Sound Relief was a benefit concert for victims of the Victorian Bushfire Crisis and the Queensland Floods. Appearing with Hoodoo Gurus at the Sydney concert were, Coldplay, Eskimo Joe, Icehouse, Jet, Josh Pyke, Little Birdy, The Presets, Wolfmother, You Am I and additional artists.

In March 2009 the Hoodoo Gurus also signed a new recording contract with Sony Music Australia, the deal includes the band&#x27;s back catalogue as well as a new album, the band&#x27;s ninth and the first since the release of &quot;Mach Schau&quot; in 2004. Brad Shepherd said it had the potential to be &quot;a career defining record&quot;. During the process of writing the album Dave Faulkner said in reference to the eclectic mix of songs ready for the album that &quot;rather than stopping myself writing something, I just didn&#x27;t artificially force myself to write in any direction&quot;. The album was originally scheduled for release in September 2009 but they were not happy with the final mix. Hoodoo Gurus then sent their songs off to Durango, Colorado, where Ed Stasium, who worked on the band&#x27;s previous albums &quot;Kinky&quot; and &quot;Crank&quot; worked with Faulkner. Faulkner flew to the US after Hoodoo Gurus performed in Japan, their first performances there in over 20 years.

In August 2009 it was revealed that Shepherd had been diagnosed with cancer and was recovering from recent surgery. It was his second cancer diagnosis, having had a melanoma removed five years earlier.

The first single from their new album, &quot;Crackin&#x27; Up&quot;, was released in December 2009 and received some airplay on Australian radio stations. The album, &quot;Purity of Essence&quot;, was released on 16 March 2010 in Australia and internationally on 11 May 2010.

On 3 October 2010, Hoodoo Gurus toured to London, UK, performing at O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire.

In 2011, they were inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

In April 2012 the band played a series of concerts titled Dig it Up! in Australian capital cities, to celebrate 30 years since the release of their debut single &quot;Leilani&quot;. At the concerts, the band performed the whole of their debut album &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; and other hits. Also playing as part of the Dig It Up! tour were Australian bands Died Pretty and The Hard Ons, as well as international bands such as Redd Kross, The Sonics and The Fleshtones.

=== 2013–present: Continued performances and &quot;Chariot of the Gods&quot; ===
In April 2013, the band hosted invitational concerts across the Australian capital cities, performing Mars Needs Guitars, and will be joined by Blue Öyster Cult, Flamin&#x27; Groovies, Buzzcocks, and Peter Case.

2014 saw the release of &quot;Gravy Train&quot;, an EP featuring three new songs and a remake of their first single &quot;Leilani&quot;.

In January 2015, it was announced that Kingsmill would be retiring from the band. His last performances were on 22 and 23 May 2015, at the &quot;Be My Guru – Evolution Revolution&quot; concerts at Sydney&#x27;s Powerhouse Museum, performed as the opening to the city&#x27;s annual Vivid Festival. The concerts reunited all eight past and present band members for a two-hour set covering their beginnings as Le Hoodoo Gurus in 1982 all the way through to 2010&#x27;s &quot;Purity of Essence&quot;.

The band headlined the &#x27;A Day on the Green&#x27; concert series in March 2016, with Sunnyboys, Violent Femmes, Died Pretty, and Ratcat.

In early 2018, the group announced a vinyl reissue campaign called the Hoodoo Gurus Record Club, entailing the reissue on coloured vinyl of their back catalogue up to &quot;Purity of Essence&quot;, which also included the album the group recorded as the Persian Rugs in 2000. The first release through the campaign was &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; on 1 June 2018, with a general public release on 7 September.

On 26 May 2018, the group held a benefit concert for the Tathra bushfire with artists The Badloves, 1927 and local talents Daniel Champagne, Corey Legge, The Figmentz, Erin McMahon, and Melanie Horsnell. The &#x27;Band Together&#x27; concert sold out and ticket sales helped raise over half of the $250,000 target towards helping residents affected by the bushfire in March 2018.

 On 13 January 2019, Hoodoo Gurus headlined the &#x27;Under the Southern Stars&#x27; concert tour of five states starting off at Hastings, Victoria, with performances in Tasmania, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia scheduled throughout January. Appearing with Hoodoo Gurus at the Hastings concert were Eskimo Joe, You Am I, The Superjesus, British India, The Getaway Plan and Scott Darlow.

In July 2020, the band released the single &quot;Hung Out to Dry&quot;. The song features on the vinyl version of the Gurus&#x27; tenth studio album, &quot;Chariot of the Gods&quot;, released in March 2022.

<text>Warwick HRI (formerly Horticulture Research International) was a United Kingdom organisation tasked with carrying out horticultural research and development and transferring the results to industry in England.

==History==
Horticulture Research International (HRI) was constituted in May 1990 from the Agricultural and Food Research Council Institute of Horticultural Research Stations at Wellesbourne (the National Vegetable Research Station), East Malling (the East Malling Research Station) and Littlehampton (the Glasshouse Crops Research Institute), the Hop Research Unit at Wye College and the ADAS Experimental Stations of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Efford, Kirton and Stockbridge.

Warwick HRI was formed on 1 April 2004 following the integration of HRI&#x27;s sites at Wellesbourne and Kirton with the University of Warwick. The Kirton site was closed by the university in February 2009.

The Wellesbourne site covered an area of 191 hectares and contained protected crop facilities, glasshouses, a bioconversion unit, controlled environment units and laboratory facilities including the Genomic Resource Centre. The Kirton site spanned 50 hectares, with seed handling equipment and a 4-hectare organic area.

Research at Warwick HRI included plant science, crop and environmental sciences, applied microbial sciences and applied horticulture. Postgraduate taught and research degrees were offered.

In November 2009, Warwick University announced that it had decided to close Warwick HRI as the centre was losing the university £2 million a year. Warwick HRI was merged with the University&#x27;s Department of Biological Sciences into a new School of Life Sciences in October 2010. Some research work on vegetable genetic improvement continued at the Crop Centre.

<doc id="847615" wikidata="Q891918" url="?curid=847615" title="Sofiero Palace">
<text>Sofiero Palace, or just Sofiero (), in Helsingborg Municipality, Scania, was one of the Swedish royal family&#x27;s country mansions, located north of Helsingborg. It was originally a Scanian farm called Skabelycke, bought in 1864 by Prince Oscar of Sweden and his wife Sophia of Nassau. The first one-story palace was completed in 1865. It was expanded to its current size between 1874 and 1876, after Prince Oscar had been crowned King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway.

== History ==
In 1905, Oscar II&#x27;s grandson Prince Gustaf Adolf, future King Gustaf VI Adolf, and his wife, Crown Princess Margaret, received the palace as a wedding gift. They renovated the palace and started the large Rhododendron garden for which the palace is known today. Prince Gustaf Adolf become king in 1950, and until 1973 Sofiero was his and his second wife Lady Louise Mountbatten&#x27;s official summer residence. It was supposedly the King&#x27;s favorite place and upon his death, which occurred in Helsingborg, he left Sofiero to the city of Helsingborg so that the general public could enjoy it as much as he had.

== Today ==
A bus connection leaves several times an hour during peak hours from Helsingborg. The main attraction today is the very large gardens with a wide range of local (and other) plant life, stretching to the shore of Öresund. The Rhododendrons are especially noteworthy, consisting of almost 500 different varieties. The park also holds a small collection of modern art.

During the summer the large grass areas are sometimes used for large outdoor concerts with national as well as international stars such as Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, James Brown and Norah Jones.

The former royal palace itself is today used as restaurant, cafe and at times as a gallery.

A brand of beer owned by Kopparbergs Brewery is named &quot;Sofiero&quot;.

<doc id="847618" wikidata="Q39639" url="?curid=847618" title="Brad Paisley">
<text>Brad Douglas Paisley (born October 28, 1972) is an American country music singer, songwriter, and guitarist. His first success came in 1997 as the writer of David Kersh&#x27;s &quot;Another You&quot;. After this, he signed with Arista Nashville in 1998 and released his debut album &quot;Who Needs Pictures&quot; in 1999. This was the first of twelve studio albums he would release for the label before its closure in 2023, after which he transferred to EMI Nashville. His most commercially successful albums are &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot; (2003) and &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot; (2005), both certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Paisley has charted more than 50 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts, including nineteen number-one singles ranging from &quot;He Didn&#x27;t Have to Be&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; in 2015. Ten of these singles were achieved consecutively, starting with &quot;When I Get Where I&#x27;m Going&quot; in 2006 and ending with &quot;Then&quot; in 2009. Paisley has collaborated with artists such as Alison Krauss, Keith Urban, Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood, and Alabama. Since 2003, he has been married to actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley.

==Early life==
Brad Douglas Paisley was born on October 28, 1972, in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He is the only child of Douglas Edward &quot;Doug&quot; Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean &quot;Sandy&quot; (née Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher.

He has stated that his love of country music stems from his maternal grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone, and taught him how to play at eight years old. In third grade, he performed for the first time in public by singing in his church. Initially, they were just going to have him play the song on the guitar instead of a piano. But then the adults heard him sing the tune and said, &quot;Forget the choir, let&#x27;s just have Brad do the whole thing.&quot;

After that, he never had to ask for a gig until he left Glen Dale. He later recalled that &quot;Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother&#x27;s Day event. The neat thing about a small town is that when you want to be an artist, by golly, they&#x27;ll make you one.&quot; At age 13, he wrote his first song, &quot;Born on Christmas Day&quot;, which later appeared on his album &quot;Brad Paisley Christmas&quot;. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence &quot;Hank&quot; Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called &quot;Brad Paisley and the C-Notes&quot;, with the addition of two of Paisley&#x27;s adult friends.

When he was in junior high, his school&#x27;s principal heard him perform &quot;Born On Christmas Day&quot; and invited him to play at the local Rotary Club meeting. In attendance was Tom Miller, the program director of a radio station in Wheeling, West Virginia. Miller asked him if he would like to be a guest on Jamboree USA. After his first performance, he was asked to become a member of the show&#x27;s weekly lineup. For the next eight years, he opened for country singers such as The Judds, Ricky Skaggs and George Jones. He would become the youngest person inducted into the Jamboree USA Hall of Fame. He also performed at the Jamboree in the Hills.

Paisley graduated from John Marshall in Glen Dale, West Virginia, in 1991, and then studied for two years at West Liberty State College in West Liberty, West Virginia. He was awarded a fully paid ASCAP scholarship to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he majored in music business and received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the Mike Curb School of Music Business in 1995. He interned at ASCAP, Atlantic Records, and the Fitzgerald-Hartley management firm. While in college, he met Frank Rogers, a fellow student who went on to serve as his producer. Paisley also met Kelley Lovelace, who became his songwriting partner. He also met Chris DuBois in college, and he, too, would write songs for him.

Within a week after graduating from Belmont, Paisley signed a songwriting contract with EMI Music Publishing; and he wrote David Kersh&#x27;s Top 5 hit, &quot;Another You&quot;, as well as David Ball&#x27;s 1999 single, &quot;Watching My Baby Not Come Back&quot;. The latter song was also co-written by Ball.

==Career==
===1999–2003: &quot;Who Needs Pictures&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;===
His debut as a singer was with the label Arista Nashville, with the song &quot;Who Needs Pictures&quot; (released February 1, 1999). In May of that same year, he made his first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry. Seven months later he had his first No. 1 hit with &quot;He Didn&#x27;t Have to Be&quot;, which detailed the story of Paisley&#x27;s frequent co-writer Kelley Lovelace and Lovelace&#x27;s stepson, McCain Merren. The album also produced a Top 20 hit with &quot;Me Neither&quot; and his second number 1 hit, &quot;We Danced&quot;, both in 2000. By February 2001, the album was certified platinum. Later in 2000, Paisley won the Country Music Association&#x27;s (CMA) Horizon Award and the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s best new male vocalist trophy. He received his first Grammy Award nomination a year later for Best New Artist. On February 17, 2001, Paisley was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry. He was 28 when he accepted the invitation. PBS did a 75th anniversary concert special, in which Paisley and Chely Wright sang a song that they co-wrote called &quot;Hard to Be a Husband, Hard to Be a Wife&quot;. This song later appeared on the compilation album &quot;Grand Ole Opry 75th Anniversary, Vol. 2&quot;. The concert would get a CMA nomination for Vocal Event of the Year.

Paisley would later contribute to Wright&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Never Love You Enough&quot;, co-writing the tracks &quot;One Night in Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Horoscope&quot;, and &quot;Not as In Love&quot;. Paisley co-produced the former two tracks with her, in addition to playing guitar on them and featuring members of his road band, The Drama Kings; he also sang backing vocals on &quot;One Night in Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;Not as In Love&quot;. In 2002, he won the CMA Music Video of the Year for &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin&#x27; Song)&quot;. Several celebrities made notable guest appearances in the video, including Little Jimmy Dickens, Kimberly Williams, Dan Patrick, and Jerry Springer. His three other singles from the &quot;Part II&quot; album, &quot;I Wish You&#x27;d Stay&quot;, &quot;Wrapped Around&quot;, and &quot;Two People Fell in Love&quot;, all charted in the top 10. The album stayed in the charts for more than 70 weeks and was certified platinum in August 2002. To support his album, he toured the country as the opening act for Lonestar.

===2003–2007: &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot;, &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot; and &quot;5th Gear&quot;===

Paisley released his third album, &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot; (2003), following &quot;Who Needs Pictures&quot; and &quot;Part II&quot;. The album features the hit song &quot;Celebrity&quot;, the video of which parodies television shows such as &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, and &quot;According to Jim&quot;, and included such celebrities as Jason Alexander, James Belushi, Little Jimmy Dickens, Trista Rehn, and William Shatner. (Paisley later contributed to Shatner&#x27;s album &quot;Has Been&quot;.) The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot;, reached Billboard No. 1 in 2004. In addition, the ninth track from &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot;, &quot;Whiskey Lullaby&quot;, a duet with Alison Krauss, reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, and No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for &quot;Whiskey Lullaby&quot; also won several awards and was rated No. 2 on the 100 Greatest Videos by CMT in 2008. The album was certified double platinum.

In 2005, after touring with Reba McEntire and Terri Clark on the Two Hats and a Redhead Tour, he released &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot; which included the singles &quot;Alcohol&quot; reaching number 4, &quot;When I Get Where I&#x27;m Going&quot; a duet with Dolly Parton, &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Everything&quot; with the last three all reaching number 1. On November 6, 2006, &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot; won the Country Music Association CMA Award for Best Album. It also won album of the year at the 2006 ACM Awards. Paisley also contributed two original songs to the Disney Pixar&#x27;s film &quot;Cars&quot;. These can be found on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. This was in recognition of his contribution to the &quot;Route 66: Main Street America&quot; television special. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, Paisley received four nominations: Best Country Album (for &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot;), Best Country Song (for &quot;Alcohol&quot;), Best Country Instrumental (for &quot;Time Warp&quot;) and Best Country Vocal, Male (for &quot;Alcohol&quot;).

Paisley&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;5th Gear&quot;, was released in the United States on June 19, 2007. The first four singles from the album, &quot;Ticks&quot;, &quot;Online&quot;, &quot;Letter to Me&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Still a Guy&quot;, all reached number one on the country music single charts, making seven straight number one hits for Paisley. &quot;Online&quot; featured the Brentwood High School marching band playing toward the end of the song, a cameo by Jason Alexander, and again featured a cameo by William Shatner. &quot;Throttleneck&quot; would also reach number one, which would get Paisley his first Grammy. The fifth single from &quot;5th Gear&quot; actually came from a reissued version of the album – a new recording of &quot;Waitin&#x27; on a Woman&quot;, a track cut from &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot;. The reissued version received unsolicited airplay in late 2006, and features less prominent string guitar and violin parts and a more &quot;muted&quot; musical tone. For the chart week of September 20, 2008, the song became Paisley&#x27;s twelfth number-one single and his eighth straight number-one hit, making him the artist with the most consecutive Number One country hits since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990. Paisley toured April 26, 2007, through February 24, 2008, in support of &quot;5th Gear&quot; on the Bonfires &amp; Amplifiers Tour. The tour visited 94 cities over a 10-month period and played for more than a million fans. The tour was so successful that it was extended past its original end date to February 2008. Some of the opening acts who appeared during the tour were Taylor Swift, Kellie Pickler, Jack Ingram, Rodney Atkins and Chuck Wicks.

Paisley was nominated for three 2008 Grammy Awards related to &quot;5th Gear&quot;: Best Country Album (for &quot;5th Gear&quot;), Best Country Collaboration (for &quot;Oh Love&quot; with Carrie Underwood), and Best Country Instrumental (for &quot;Throttleneck&quot;). On February 10, 2008, he won his first Grammy award for Best Country Instrumental for &quot;Throttleneck&quot;. In March 2008, Paisley announced his next tour, The Paisley Party, a 42-date tour sponsored by Hershey&#x27;s. The tour kicked off on June 11, 2008, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Wicks, Julianne Hough and Jewel as the opening acts.

===2008–2010: &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;American Saturday Night&quot; ===

A sixth instrumental album, titled &quot;Play&quot;, was released on November 4, 2008. Paisley and Keith Urban released to country radio their first duet together on September 8, 2008, &quot;Start a Band&quot;. It was the first and only single from &quot;Play&quot;, and it went on to become Paisley&#x27;s thirteenth number one hit and his ninth in a row. The album also features collaborations with James Burton, Little Jimmy Dickens, Vince Gill, John Jorgenson, B.B. King, Albert Lee, Brent Mason, Buck Owens, Redd Volkaert and Steve Wariner. Paisley and Urban both received Entertainer of the Year nominations from the CMA on September 10, 2008. On November 12, 2008, Paisley won Male Vocalist of the Year and Music Video of the Year for &quot;Waitin&#x27; on a Woman&quot; during the CMAs.

Paisley announced on January 26, 2009, that he would be embarking on a new tour named American Saturday Night, with Dierks Bentley and Jimmy Wayne opening for most of the shows. Paisley&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;American Saturday Night&quot;, was released on June 30, 2009. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Then&quot;, was released in March 2009 and performed for the first time on &quot;American Idol&quot; on March 18. It went on to become Paisley&#x27;s 14th number one single and his tenth in a row. On July 21, 2009, Paisley performed at the White House for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama in celebration of country music. &quot;Country Music at the White House&quot; was streamed live on the White House website as well as a special on Great American Country. On November 11, 2009, Paisley co-hosted the CMA Awards for the second straight year. He also performed &quot;Welcome to the Future&quot;, and won both Male Vocalist of the Year and Musical Event of the Year for &quot;Start a Band&quot; with Keith Urban.
On March 1, 2010, Paisley was the first musical performance with &quot;American Saturday Night&quot; for the second tenure of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. On March 5, 2010, Paisley slipped and fell performing his last song of the set, &quot;Alcohol&quot;, at a concert at the North Charleston Coliseum in Charleston, South Carolina, on the final date of the American Saturday Night Tour. Fearing a broken rib, he was held overnight at an area hospital, but was released when an MRI was negative. On July 31, 2010, Paisley performed alongside Carrie Underwood at the inaugural Greenbrier Classic PGA Tour Event in Lewisburg, West Virginia. An estimated 60,000 people attended the outdoor event to watch Underwood and Paisley perform in the pouring rain. On August 4, 2010, it was announced on his official website that Paisley would release his first official greatest hits package, entitled &quot;Hits Alive&quot;. Released on November 2, 2010, &quot;Hits Alive&quot; is a double-disc collection, with one disc containing studio versions of Paisley&#x27;s hit singles, while the companion disc features previously unreleased live versions of his songs. Paisley cohosted the 44th Annual CMA Awards on November 10, 2010, where he was also awarded the CMA&#x27;s top award, Entertainer of the Year. During his acceptance speech, Paisley emotionally honored his grandfather, who inspired him to play the guitar. In 2012, MSN.com listed &quot;American Saturday Night&quot; as one of the 21 Essential 21st-Century Albums.

===2011–2014: &quot;This Is Country Music&quot; and &quot;Wheelhouse&quot;===
In December 2010, Paisley released &quot;This Is Country Music&quot; as the title track to his eighth studio album, released May 23, 2011. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Old Alabama&quot; (with Alabama), released to country radio on March 14, 2011, and became Paisley&#x27;s nineteenth number one hit. &quot;Remind Me&quot;, with Carrie Underwood, was released May 23, 2011, to radio. On March 22, 2011, Paisley&#x27;s website announced a new beta game titled &quot;Brad Paisley World&quot;. The game is modeled after other Facebook games such as Farmville or Mafia Wars and features original animation. The game provides a new way for fans to interact with each other and view exclusive material that would otherwise be unavailable. On May 12, 2011, Paisley&#x27;s website announced that he would release two songs on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Cars 2&quot;. One of them would be a collaboration with British pop singer Robbie Williams.
On September 21, 2011, Mailboat Records released &quot;Mark Twain: Words &amp; Music&quot;, a double-CD telling Mark Twain&#x27;s life in spoken word and song, including a new song by Paisley titled &quot;Huck Finn Blues&quot;. Paisley&#x27;s website announced that he was a fan of Twain, prompting his collaboration on the project with Clint Eastwood, Jimmy Buffett, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, and others. On October 19, 2011, Paisley made a voice cameo as various background characters in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Bass to Mouth&quot;.

On January 14, 2012, Paisley was a guest on Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;, during which he did a rendition of &quot;Life&#x27;s Railway to Heaven&quot; by Charles Davis Tillman. On April 25, 2012, Paisley was featured on the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Cartman Finds Love&quot;, in which he voiced himself, sang the national anthem and helped Cartman sing the 1990s hit song &quot;I Swear&quot;, which was popularized in 1994 by the country musician John Michael Montgomery and the pop group All-4-One. Paisley extended his Virtual Reality World Tour through mid-2012. He toured the country and made pit stops at local country music festivals.

On September 20, 2012, Paisley released a new single, &quot;Southern Comfort Zone&quot;. The song debuted at number 25 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming Paisley&#x27;s highest debut to date. It reached number 2 on the Country Airplay chart in 2013. The song was the first single from his ninth studio album, &quot;Wheelhouse&quot;, released on April 9, 2013. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Beat This Summer&quot;, was released to country radio on March 4, 2013. It also reached number 2 on the Country Airplay chart in July 2013. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Change the World&quot;, was released to country radio on August 19, 2013: despite a moderately good debut, the single failed to reach the top 20 on country charts, peaking at number 22 on Country Airplay and becoming Paisley&#x27;s lowest-charting single to date. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;The Mona Lisa&quot;, was released to country radio on December 9, 2013. It peaked at number 19 on Country Airplay.

On June 12, 2013, Paisley announced on his Twitter page that he would join the Rolling Stones onstage during the band&#x27;s concert in Philadelphia. His track &quot;Accidental Racist&quot;, a duet with rapper LL Cool J, generated notoriety when it was released. Paisley sings about how he finds himself &quot;caught between Southern pride and Southern blame&quot;: Paisley explained that he is proud of where he is from, but he feels ashamed of the South&#x27;s history of slavery and racism. The song generated controversy for its discussion of racism, particularly the song&#x27;s message of showing &quot;Southern pride&quot;, which includes re-appropriation of the Confederate flag.

===2014–2017: &quot;Moonshine in the Trunk&quot; and &quot;Love and War&quot;===

On April 6, 2014, Paisley released &quot;River Bank&quot;. It is the lead single from his tenth studio album for Sony Music Entertainment, &quot;Moonshine in the Trunk&quot;, which was released on August 26, 2014. Paisley co-wrote the song with Kelley Lovelace and co-produced it with Luke Wooten. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;, was released to country radio on September 2, 2014. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in January 2015. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Crushin&#x27; It&quot;, was released to country radio on January 26, 2015. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Country Nation&quot;, was released to country radio on September 14, 2015. On May 24, 2014, Paisley traveled on Air Force One with President Barack Obama to visit US troops at Bagram Air Base in Bagram, Afghanistan. Paisley played a full concert for the troops stationed there. On June 1, 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Welcome to the Future&quot; #100 in their list of the 100 greatest country songs. In September 2014, &quot;Moonshine in the Trunk&quot; became Paisley&#x27;s eighth number one album on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums chart. It also became his ninth Top 10 Pop album and fifth
album to reach #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Paisley released &quot;Without a Fight&quot;, a duet with Demi Lovato, on May 13, 2016. It was to have served as the lead single to his eleventh studio album, but due to poor chart performance it did not make the album&#x27;s final cut. He was selected as one of thirty artists to perform on &quot;Forever Country&quot;, a mash-up track of &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;,
&quot;On the Road Again&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; which celebrates 50 years of the CMA Awards. The second single &quot;Today&quot; was released on October 6, 2016, which gave Paisley his first Country Digital Song Sales No. 1, opening at the top of the chart with 41,000 first-week downloads.
 The single landed in the No.1 spot on the Country Aircheck/Mediabase charts, marking Paisley&#x27;s 24th No.1 song. On November 11, Paisley announced on Twitter that the title of the album would be &quot;Love and War&quot;, which was released in April 2017. &quot;Love and War&quot; features several collaborations with iconic artists, including Timbaland, John Fogerty, Bill Anderson, and Mick Jagger, as well as a songwriting credit with Johnny Cash.

===2018–present: The Store, label change and &quot;Son of the Mountains&quot;===

On October 4, 2018, Paisley and his wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley partnered with Belmont University and opened a free referral-based grocery store in Nashville to help the community in need. The board of trustees for The Store include Brad Paisley, president; Megan Zarling, chair; Pete Fisher, vice-chair; Doug Paisley, secretary and Elaine Bryan, treasurer. In November 2018, Paisley released &quot;Bucked Off&quot;. On March 11, 2019, Paisley released &quot;My Miracle&quot;.

In 2019, Paisley was a guest judge on season 14 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. During the &quot;Judge Cuts&quot;, he pressed the Golden Buzzer for singer/guitarist Sophie Pecora. In 2021, Paisley was featured on Jimmie Allen&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Was a Highway&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Airplay chart in February 2022, becoming Paisley&#x27;s twentieth number one single, and his first since &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; in January 2015. This distinction also tied Paisley with Brooks &amp; Dunn and Toby Keith for the tenth most number one singles since the chart&#x27;s inception in January 1990.

In February 2023, after being on Arista Nashville since the beginning of his career, Paisley signed a new record deal with EMI Nashville. On February 24, 2023, he released &quot;Same Here&quot; featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Paisley also plans to release his thirteenth studio album, &quot;Son of the Mountains&quot; set to be released in 2024. On June 24, 2023, Paisley released the second single of his upcoming album, titled &quot;So Many Summers&quot;.

In September 2024, Paisley revealed he was postponing the &quot;Son of the Mountains&quot; album and is instead working on a different album; according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the new album is expected to be released in early 2025. &quot;Truck Still Works&quot; was released as the first single for the new, currently untitled album, and it was described by Paisley and &quot;Billboard&quot; as a &quot;sequel&quot; to Paisley&#x27;s hit &quot;Mud on the Tires&quot;. In October, he performed Merle Haggard&#x27;s hit &quot;Workin&#x27; Man Blues&quot; at the annual induction ceremony for the Country Music Hall of Fame to celebrate his friend James Burton&#x27;s induction; Burton had played on Haggard&#x27;s original recording.

==Books==
===&quot;Jug Fishing for Greazy and Other Brad Paisley Fishing Stories&quot;===
Paisley released his book &quot;Jug Fishing for Greazy and Other Brad Paisley Fishing Stories&quot; in 2003 under Thomas Nelson Publishing. He co-wrote the book with author M. B. Roberts.

===&quot;Diary of a Player&quot;===
Paisley released his book &quot;Diary of a Player: How My Musical Heroes Made a Guitar Man Out of Me&quot; in 2011 under Howard Books Publishing. He co-wrote the book with author David Wild, a contributing editor for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and an Emmy nominated TV writer and producer. The book is an autobiography and talks about Paisley&#x27;s introduction to the music industry and how the events in his life helped to prepare him for what was up ahead. The book features topics such as the first guitar that his grandfather gave him, his first band the C-notes, the first song he wrote, and many more music/guitar related topics. Although the book does speak briefly of his personal life, the main focus is on his music and the start of his career.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
In the last months of 2000, Paisley had a relationship with fellow country music singer Chely Wright. Unbeknownst to Paisley, Wright and her girlfriend had moved together into a new home earlier in the year. In her autobiography, Wright expressed regret for how she treated him.
In 2001 he began dating Kimberly Williams, whom he had first seen in the film &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; ten years earlier. Paisley saw the movie while on a date with a different girl who later left him for his best friend; four years later, he went to see the sequel alone. Paisley stated that he watched Williams&#x27; performance and thought &quot;She seems like a great girl — smart and funny and all those things that are so hard to find.&quot;

Paisley&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;Part II&quot;, featured several songs he&#x27;d written about the old girlfriend, including one about going to see &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;. When it came time to cast the music video for &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin&#x27; Song)&quot;, Paisley said, &quot;It felt natural to ask [Williams, the girl from the movie] to be in it.&quot; The two began dating soon after and were married on March 15, 2003, at Stauffer Chapel on the campus of Pepperdine University after a nine-month engagement. They live in Franklin, Tennessee, and had another home in Pacific Palisades that was sold in 2013.

Paisley and Williams&#x27; first son, William Huckleberry, also called &quot;Huck&quot;, was born on February 22, 2007, in Nashville. Their second son, Jasper Warren (named after his grandfather, who bought Paisley his first guitar), was born on April 17, 2009.

===Hobbies and other interests===
Paisley is an active Freemason, a member of Hiram Lodge #7 in Franklin, Tennessee. Paisley is a member of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and a Noble of the AAONMS, also known as Shriners. He was accompanied by his father, Doug Paisley (33º), for the ceremony on October 28, 2006, and has done a number of recordings supporting the virtues of Freemasonry and DeMolay International. Paisley has described himself as a Christian.

Paisley is a fan of the Cleveland Browns and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Paisley sang the national anthem at Dodger Stadium before Game 2 of the 2017 World Series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros, again before Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox, and again before Game 1 of the 2024 World Series between the Dodgers and the New York Yankees. Paisley also sang the national anthem before a Browns game during the 1999 season, and stated in an interview with ESPN his dream job would be to play football for them. He invited former Browns quarterback Brady Quinn to a concert at the Blossom Music Center in 2008. Paisley is a fan of West Virginia athletics and has appeared as a celebrity guest picker on College GameDay.

In late 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Paisley was the executive producer of a new hour-long scripted drama series called &quot;Nashville&quot; that would air on The CW network. It was written by Neal Dodson and Matt Bomer, with Zachary Quinto as another executive producer and Mark Schwahn as director. The pilot was not picked up for a series, and it is not the same as the show of the same name that premiered in 2012 and featured two cameo appearances from Paisley and a recurring role for his wife Kimberly Williams.

==Instruments==

Paisley&#x27;s first guitar, a gift from his grandfather, was a Silvertone Danelectro 1451, which came with an &quot;amp-in-case&quot;. His next guitar, which he got at the age of 10 or 11, also from his grandfather, was a Sekova copy of a Gibson ES-335, with a Fender Deluxe Reverb. The instrument most often associated with him is a 1968 Pink Paisley Fender Telecaster. Brad&#x27;s main guitars are Crook Custom Guitars. These guitars are designed by Bill Crook and feature the paisley wallpaper in a variety of colors.

Like many Nashville-based musicians, he lost a number of instruments and other gear in the 2010 flood in Nashville, including a 1970s Gibson Les Paul and the prototype for a Z Wreck, one of the signature Paisley Dr. Z amplifiers. The insurance money, however, allowed him to buy (from George Gruhn&#x27;s store) an exclusive 1937 herringbone Martin D-28.

In 2010, Paisley and Wampler Pedals released the Brad Paisley signature Paisley Drive, a guitar overdrive pedal designed to his specifications. Paisley has also used Audiotech Guitar Products ABY Selector&#x27;s for controlling his wireless receiver units.

In 2015 Santa Cruz Guitar Company introduced the Brad Paisley Signature Model, B/PW, acoustic dreadnought guitar. Paisley is often seen playing this model of guitar, such as in the 2017 Netflix original Brad Paisley&#x27;s Comedy Rodeo.

In 2016 Paisley and Dr. Z Amplification collaborated and released the DB4 model. The name DB4 is thus named because it is &quot;Doc &amp; Brad&#x27;s fourth amp design&quot;. The pentode preamp tube is a 5879 with EL84 output tubes.

== Charity and advocacy ==
In June 2021, Paisley promoted the COVID vaccine with first lady Jill Biden by singing a cover of &quot;Jolene&quot; that substituting the words &quot;Jolene, Jolene, Jolene&quot; for &quot;vaccine, vaccine, vaccine&quot;. He became a vocal advocate for Ukraine after Putin announced a &quot;special military operation&quot; in 2022, joining the United24 project as an ambassador for its &quot;Rebuilding Ukraine&quot; program. In March 2023 Paisley announced that he would donate royalties from &quot;Same Here&quot; to rebuilding efforts.

Paisley released &quot;The Medicine Will&quot; in 2021 criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for its role in causing the United States opioid crisis.

<text>The Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) is a multi-campus marine research consortium of the California State University System, headquartered at Moss Landing, California.

==Organization==
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories is part of the California State University, administered by San Jose State University (SJSU), and located in Moss Landing, California. The main building is located at 8272 Moss Landing Road, . It was established in 1966.
At the midpoint of the coast of Monterey Bay, it is only a few hundred meters from Monterey Canyon, the largest undersea canyon on the west coast of the Americas. As a result, researchers are able to reach areas with depths greater than 1000 meters in less than an hour by boat from the facility.

The facility is a sea grant college, which offers a Master&#x27;s of Science degree in marine sciences through the seven universities that make up the consortium, as well as offering graduate and undergraduate marine science courses to the students of the campuses.

The seven members of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories consortium are:
*California State University, East Bay
*California State University, Fresno
*California State University, Monterey Bay
*California State University, Sacramento
*San Francisco State University
*San Jose State University
*California State University, Stanislaus

Researchers at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories also collaborate with scientists at other institutions in analysis of marine chemistry and marine species. One frequent partner for such collaboration is the Marine Mammal Center.

===Research vessels===
MLML operates two vessels, the R/V &quot;John H. Martin&quot;, and the R/V &quot;Sheila B&quot;.

===Sea Grant===
Moss Landing Marine Laboratories participates in the Sea Grant Colleges program by hosting an office of the UC Sea Grant Extension Program, affiliated with University of California, San Diego.

=== Projects ===
The Submersible Capable of Under Ice Navigation and Imaging was a National Science Foundation funded research project for robotic under the sea ice for surveying and exploration in Antarctica from 2007 through 2009.

The Vertical Transport and Exchange of Ocean Particulate program (VERTEX) was initiated by Moss Landing Marine Labs in 1981 by Dr. John Martin. This project resulted in the development of the Iron Iron fertilization theory (then known as the Iron Hypothesis) which stated iron was a limiting factor in ocean water phytoplankton production and its influence for climate change. Dr.Martin was dubbed the nickname &quot;Iron Man&quot; for his role in this discovery.

<doc id="847622" wikidata="Q911924" url="?curid=847622" title="Holy Synod">
<text>In several of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches and Eastern Catholic Churches, the patriarch or head bishop is elected by a group of bishops called the Holy Synod. For instance, the Holy Synod is a ruling body of the Georgian Orthodox Church.

In Oriental Orthodoxy the Holy Synod is the highest authority in the church and it formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of church organization, faith, and order of service.

==Early synods==
The principle of summoning a synod or council of ecclesiastical persons to discuss some grave question affecting the Church goes back to the very beginning of the Church&#x27;s history. Since the day when the Apostles met at Jerusalem to settle whether Gentile converts were to keep the Old Law (Acts 15:6–29), it had been the custom to call together such gatherings as occasion required. Bishops summoned synods of their clergy, metropolitans and patriarchs summoned their suffragans, and then since 325 there was a succession of those greatest synods, representing the whole Catholic world, that are known as general councils.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==

=== Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate ===

The Ecumenical Patriarchate is governed by the &quot;Holy and Sacred Synod&quot;, developed from the &quot;endemousa synod&quot; (the &quot;resident&quot; synod), which consisted of the bishops living (even if only transiently) in or near Constantinople. It is presided over by the Patriarch of Constantinople and consists of twelve hierarchs, each of whom holds membership for a year, with half of them being replaced every six months.

===The Russian Holy Synod===
The Most Holy Synod or Most Holy Governing Synod () was a congregation of Orthodox church leaders in Russia. It was established by Peter the Great, Stefan Yavorsky and Feofan Prokopovich in January 1721 to replace the Patriarchate of Moscow. It was abolished following the February Revolution of 1917 and replaced with a restored patriarchate under Tikhon of Moscow. In modern Russia, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church is the highest governing body of the Russian Orthodox Church between Sobors. It is headed by the Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus&#x27;.

===The Greek Holy Synod===
The first other Orthodox Church to imitate the Russian Government by synod was that of Greece. The national assemblies of free Greece in 1822 and 1827 began the process of making their Church independent of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1833 the Greek Parliament formally rejected the patriarch&#x27;s authority and set up a Holy Directing Synod in exact imitation of Russia. After much dispute, the patriarch gave in and acknowledged the Greek synod, in 1850. Since then, the Church of Greece has been governed by a Holy Synod exactly as was the Church of Russia.

A law in 1852 regulated its rights and duties. It met at Athens under the presidency of the Metropolitan of Athens. Four other bishops were appointed by the Government as members for a year by vote. The members took an oath of fidelity to the king and government. Their deliberations were controlled by a royal commissioner, who was a layman chosen by government, just as the Russian oberprocuror. No act was valid without the commissioner&#x27;s assent. There were also secretaries, writers, and a servant all appointed by the State. The Holy Synod was the highest authority in the Greek Church and had the same rights and duties as its Russian model, and was named in the liturgy instead of a patriarch.

After the proclamation of the Greek Republic in 1924, royal control of the Holy Synod naturally ceased, and with the elevation of the Metropolitan of Athens to an Archbishophric in 1932, the Archbishop began to be named in liturgies. Today, supreme authority is vested in the synod of all the diocesan bishops, who all have metropolitical status (the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece) under the presidency of the Archbishop of Athens and all Greece. This synod deals with general church questions. The Standing Synod is under the same presidency, and consists of the Primate and 12 bishops, each serving for one term on a rotating basis and deals with details of administration.

===Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church===
The Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church is organized as the highest authority on all matters concerning the church. It comprises the Patriarch, all metropolitans, archbishops, bishops and vicar bishops of the church. The Holy Synod usually meets two times a year, in spring and autumn in ordinary sessions but extraordinary sessions are organized whenever necessary. Whilst is the supreme authority on all matters of the church, it is a deliberative authority, as all of its members are the leaders of the entire church, directly representing all of the believers of the RoOC.

===Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox Church===

The Serbian Orthodox Church is governed by a five-member Holy Synod. The patriarch is a permanent member, while the other four are bishops elected for two-year terms by the Bishops&#x27; Council, a body that represents all the metropolitans and other bishops of the church.

===Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church===

The supreme clerical, judicial and administrative power for the whole domain of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is exercised by the Holy Synod, which includes the Patriarch and the diocesan prelates, who are called metropolitans.

===Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in America===
The supreme canonical authority of the Orthodox Church in America is delegated to the bishops of the Holy Synod. The Metropolitan is ex officio the Chairman of the Synod, but in his absence a chairman may be elected by the synodal bishops.

== Oriental Orthodoxy ==

===The Coptic Holy Synod===

The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the highest authority in the Church of Alexandria and it formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of church&#x27;s organization, faith, service&#x27;s order.

The Synod is chaired by the Pope of Alexandria and the members are the Church&#x27;s Metropolitans, Bishops, Chorbishops and the Patriarchal Vicar for Alexandria.

===The Syriac Holy Synod===
The Holy Synod of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch is the highest authority of the Church of Antioch. It is chaired by the Patriarch of Antioch with metropolitans and bishops as members.

== Catholic Church ==

Within the Catholic Church, each &quot;sui iuris&quot; patriarchal church and each major archiepiscopal church has its own synod of bishops, which is exclusively competent to make laws for the entire &quot;sui iuris&quot; church in question and is its tribunal.

The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches makes mention 115 times of the synod of bishops in this sense. It does not add honorific adjectives such as &quot;holy&quot;, &quot;holy and sacred&quot; &quot;most holy&quot;, as used in some Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches.

The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches distinguishes between a patriarchal or major archiepiscopal church&#x27;s standing synod and the synod of its bishops as a whole. It is the standing synod that corresponds to the term &quot;holy synod&quot; as used above. The standing synod consists of the patriarch or major archbishop and four bishops appointed for a five-year term. Of these four, three are elected by the church&#x27;s synod of bishops and one is appointed by the patriarch or major archbishop, while another four are designated in the same way to replace any member who is impeded. A meeting of the synod of all the church&#x27;s bishops is called when a decision is required on a question that only it is authorized to decide, or when the patriarch or major archbishop, with the agreement of the standing synod, judges it to be necessary, or when at least one third of the bishops request that it be held to consider some specific matter. In addition, the individual canon law of some of these churches requires that their synod of bishops be convoked at predetermined intervals.

In metropolitan &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches a role analogous to that of the synod of bishops is played by a council of hierarchs.

<doc id="847624" wikidata="Q262816" url="?curid=847624" title="Ilf and Petrov">
<text>[[Ilya Ilf]] (Ilya Arnoldovich Feinsilberg or , 1897–1937) and [[Yevgeny Petrov (writer)|Yevgeny Petrov]] (Yevgeniy Petrovich Katayev or , 1902–1942) were two Soviet prose authors of the 1920s and 1930s. They did much of their writing together, and are almost always referred to as &quot;Ilf and Petrov&quot;. They were natives of Odessa.

The duo were arguably the most popular satirical writers in the Soviet period, representatives of the &quot;Odessa School&quot; of humorist writers, and some of the very prominent, mostly Jewish (Odessa native) cultural figures along with Isaac Babel and Leonid Utesov, who moved to work in the Soviet capital after the abolition of restrictions on Jewish residence in the Pale of Settlement.

== Publications ==
Ilf and Petrov gained a high profile for their two satirical novels: &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1928) and its sequel, &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; (1931). The two texts are connected by their main character, Ostap Bender, a con man in pursuit of elusive riches. Both books follow exploits of Bender and his associates looking for treasure amidst the contemporary Soviet reality. They were written and are set in the relatively liberal era in Soviet history, the New Economic Policy of the 1920s. The main characters generally avoid contact with the apparently lax law enforcement. Their position outside the organized, goal-driven, productive Soviet society is emphasized. It also gives the authors a convenient platform from which to look at this society and to make fun of its less attractive and less Socialist aspects. These are among the most widely read and quoted books in Russian culture. &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; was adapted for ca. twenty movies; in the Soviet Union (by Leonid Gaidai and by Mark Zakharov), in the US (in particular by Mel Brooks) and in other countries.

From the late 1920s to 1937, the co-authors wrote several theatrical plays and screenplays, as well as many humorous short stories and satirical articles in the magazines &quot;Chudak&quot;, &quot;30 days&quot;, &quot;Krokodil&quot; and &quot;Ogoniok&quot;; and the newspapers &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;. In the first years of joint creativity Ilf and Petrov published their stories and satires under parodic pseudonyms: &quot;Tolstoevsky&quot; (composed of the names of writers Tolstoy and Dostoevsky), &quot;Don Busilio&quot; (from Don Basilio, a character in the opera &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, and the Russian verb &quot;busa&quot; – scandal, noise), &quot;Cold philosopher&quot; and others.

The two writers also traveled across the Great Depression-era United States. Ilf took many pictures throughout the journey, and the authors produced a photo essay entitled &quot;American Photographs&quot;, published in &quot;Ogoniok&quot; magazine. Shortly after that they published the book &quot;Одноэтажная Америка&quot; (literally: &quot;One-storied America&quot;), translated as &quot;Little Golden America&quot; (an allusion to &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot;). The first edition of the book did not include Ilf&#x27;s photographs. Both the photo essay and the book document their adventures with their characteristic humor and playfulness. Notably, Ilf and Petrov were not afraid to praise many aspects of the American lifestyle in these works while being highly critical of others. The title comes from the following description.

Vladimir Nabokov considered them to be &quot;wonderfully gifted writers&quot;.

Ilf died of tuberculosis a few months after their return from the USA. Petrov became a front line correspondent during the Second World War and, after covering the fighting in Sevastopol, was killed when the airplane he was travelling in back to Moscow crashed while flying low to avoid anti-aircraft fire.

== Script authors ==
* &quot;Woman-Sycophant&quot; – comic play (1930, “Подхалимка”)
* &quot;House-Barracks&quot; – screenplay (1931, “Барак”)
* &quot;Strong Feeling&quot; – vaudeville (1933, “Сильное чувство”)
* &quot;Under the Circus Dome&quot; – comic play (1934, with Valentin Kataev, “Под куполом цирка”)

<doc id="847626" wikidata="Q926905" url="?curid=847626" title="Iraqi insurgency (2003–2011)">
<text>The first Iraqi insurgency lasted from 2003 until 2011, beginning shortly after the 2003 American invasion deposed longtime leader Saddam Hussein, and lasting until the end of the Iraq War and U.S. withdrawal in 2011. It was followed by a renewed insurgency.

The initial outbreak of violence (the 2003–2006 phase) was triggered by the fall and preceded the establishment of the new Iraqi government by the Multi-National Force – Iraq (MNF–I), which was led by the United States. From around 2004 to May 2007, Iraqi insurgents largely focused their attacks on MNF-I troops, but later shifted to targeting the post-invasion Iraqi security forces as well.

The insurgents were composed of a diverse mix of private militias, pro-Saddam Ba&#x27;athists, local Iraqis opposed to the MNF–I and/or the post-Saddam Iraqi government, and a number of foreign jihadists. The various insurgent groups fought an asymmetric war of attrition against the MNF–I and the Iraqi government, while also fighting among themselves.

The insurgency was shaped by sectarian tensions in Iraq, particularly between Shia Muslims (~60% of the population) and Sunni Muslims (~35% of the population). By February 2006, the violence escalated into a Shia–Sunni civil war, and for the next two years, the MNF–I and the Iraqi government were locked in intense fighting with various militants, who were also targeting each other based on their sectarian affiliations. Many of the militant attacks in American-controlled territories were directed at the Shia-dominated government of Nouri al-Maliki. Militancy continued amid post-invasion Iraqi reconstruction efforts, as the federal government tried to establish itself in the country. The civil war and sectarian violence ended in mid-2008, having been quelled by the American troop surge of 2007.

However, after the American withdrawal from Iraq in December 2011, a renewed sectarian and anti-government insurgency swept through the country, causing thousands of casualties. Two years later, the violence of the new insurgency escalated into the Second Iraq War, largely triggered by the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

== Background ==

The 2003 invasion of Iraq (20 March – 1 May 2003) began the Iraq War, or &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland invaded Iraq and toppled the government of Saddam Hussein within 26 days of major combat operations. The invasion phase consisted of a conventionally fought war which concluded with the capture of the Iraq capital Baghdad by U.S. forces.

Four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 20 March to 15 April 2003. These were the United States (148,000), United Kingdom (45,000), Australia (2,000), and Poland (194). Thirty-six other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops were assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The United States supplied the majority of the invading forces, but also received support from Kurdish irregulars in Iraqi Kurdistan.

The invasion was preceded by an air strike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Province from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While the special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi army to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and Baghdad was occupied on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi army including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country.

On 1 May, an end of major combat operations was declared, ending the invasion stage of the Iraq War and beginning the military occupation period and the Iraqi insurgency against coalition forces.

On 23 May 2003, Iraqi military personnel, police and security services were disbanded per Order 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Administrator Paul Bremer, leaving 400,000 soldiers jobless, which Western and Iraqi critics of the U.S. action said provided a ready pool of recruits for Islamist groups and other insurgents that emerged. Furthermore, for 10 months Iraq&#x27;s borders were left open for anyone to come in without even a visa or a passport.

== History ==
=== 2003–2006: initial insurgency ===

The Iraqi insurgency of 2003–06 erupted following the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule in May 2003. The armed insurgent opposition to the United States-led multinational force in Iraq and the post-2003 Iraqi government lasted until early 2006, when it deteriorated into a sectarian civil war, the most violent phase of the Iraq War.

=== 2006–2008: insurgency to civil war ===
Following the U.S.-launched 2003 invasion of Iraq, the situation deteriorated, and by 2007, the intercommunal violence between Iraqi Sunni and Shi&#x27;a factions was described by the National Intelligence Estimate as having elements of a civil war. In a 10 January 2007 address to the American people, President George W. Bush stated that &quot;80% of Iraq&#x27;s sectarian violence occurs within of the capital. This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves, and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis.&quot; Two polls of Americans conducted in 2006 found that between 65% and 85% believed Iraq was in a civil war; however, a similar poll of Iraqis conducted in 2007 found that 61% did not believe that they were in a civil war.

In October 2006, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Iraqi government estimated that more than 370,000 Iraqis had been displaced since the 2006 bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, bringing the total number of Iraqi refugees to more than 1.6 million. By 2008, the UNHCR raised the estimate of refugees to a total of about 4.7 million (~16% of the population). The number of refugees estimated abroad was 2 million (a number close to CIA projections) and the number of internally displaced people was 2.7 million. The estimated number of orphans across Iraq has ranged from 400,000 (according to the Baghdad Provincial Council), to five million (according to Iraq&#x27;s anti-corruption board). A UN report from 2008 placed the number of orphans at about 870,000. The Red Cross has also stated that Iraq&#x27;s humanitarian situation remains among the most critical in the world, with millions of Iraqis forced to rely on insufficient and poor-quality water sources.

According to the Failed States Index, produced by Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace, Iraq was one of the world&#x27;s top 5 unstable states from 2005 to 2008. A poll of top U.S. foreign policy experts conducted in 2007 showed that over the next 10 years, just 3% of experts believed the U.S. would be able to rebuild Iraq into a &quot;beacon of democracy&quot; and 58% of experts believed that Sunni-Shiite tensions would dramatically increase in the Middle East.

In June 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense reported that &quot;the security, political and economic trends in Iraq continue to be positive; however, they remain fragile, reversible and uneven.&quot; In July 2008, the audit arm of the U.S. Congress recommended that the U.S. Government should &quot;develop an updated strategy for Iraq that defines U.S. goals and objectives after July 2008 and addresses the long-term goal of achieving an Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself&quot;. Steven Simon, a Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in May 2008 that &quot;the recent short-term gains&quot; had &quot;come at the expense of the long-term goal of a stable, unitary Iraq.&quot;

After Iraqi security forces took the lead in security operations on 30 June 2009, Iraq experienced a &quot;dramatic reduction in war-related violence of all types ..., with civilian and military deaths down by 80 to 90 percent compared with the same period in 2008.&quot;

=== 2008–2011: low-level insurgency ===
In 2010, a low point for the al-Qaeda effort in Iraq, car bombings declined to an average of ten a month and multiple-location attacks occurred only two or three times a year.

== Aftermath ==

=== 2011–2013: American withdrawal and renewed insurgency ===
The Iraqi attacks since U.S. withdrawal relates to the last stage of violent terror activities engaged by Iraqi, primarily radical Sunni and Shia insurgent groups against the central government and the sectarian warfare between various factions within Iraq in the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal. The events of post-U.S. withdrawal violence succeeded the previous insurgency in Iraq (prior to 18 December 2011), but have showed increasingly violent patterns, raising concerns that the surging violence might slide into another civil war.

== Militant organizations ==
The Iraqi insurgency is composed of at least a dozen major organizations and perhaps as many as 40 distinct groups. These groups are subdivided into countless smaller cells. The Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that less than 10% of insurgents are non-Iraqi foreign fighters. According to the Chief of the British General Staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt, speaking in September 2007,


Because of its clandestine nature, the exact composition of the Iraqi insurgency is difficult to determine, but the main groupings are:
* Ba&#x27;athists, the supporters of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s former administration including army or intelligence officers, whose ideology is a variant of Pan-Arabism.
* Iraqi nationalists, Iraqis who believe in a strong version of Iraqi self-determination. These policies may not necessarily espouse a Pan-Arab ideology, but rather advocate the country&#x27;s territorial integrity including Kuwait and Khuzestan. Historical figures of this movement include the pre-Ba&#x27;athist leader of Iraq Abd al-Karim Qasim and his government.
* Iraqi Salafi Islamists, the indigenous armed followers of the Salafi movement, as well as any remnants of the Kurdish Ansar al-Islam: individuals with a Salafi-only policy opposed to non-Salafis though not aligned to one specific ethnic group. Though opposed to the U.S.-led invasion, these groups are not wholly sympathetic towards the former Ba&#x27;ath Party as its members included non-Salafis.
* Shi&#x27;a militias, including the southern, Iran-linked Badr Organization, the Mahdi Army, and the central-Iraq followers of Muqtada al-Sadr. These groups neither advocate the dominance of a single ethnic group, nor the traditional ideologies behind the Iraqi state (e.g. these particular Shi&#x27;as do not support the capture of Khuzestan or other border areas with Iran, but rather promote warm relations with Iran&#x27;s Shi&#x27;a government).
* Foreign Islamist volunteers, including those often linked to al Qaeda and largely driven by the Salafi/Wahhabi doctrine (the two preceding categories are often lumped as &quot;jihadists&quot;);
* Possibly some socialist revolutionaries (such as the Iraqi Armed Revolutionary Resistance, which claimed one attack in 2007).
* Non-violent resistance groups and political parties (not part of the armed insurgency).

=== Arab nationalists ===
==== Ba&#x27;athists and pro-Saddamists ====
The Ba&#x27;athists include former Ba&#x27;ath Party officials, the Fedayeen Saddam, the Special Republican Guard and some former agents of the Iraqi intelligence elements and security services, such as the Mukhabarat and the Special Security Organization. Their goal, at least before the capture of Saddam Hussein, was the restoration of the former Ba&#x27;athist government to power. The pre-war organization of the Ba&#x27;ath Party and its militias as a cellular structure aided the continued pro-Saddam resistance after the fall of Baghdad, and Iraqi intelligence operatives may have developed a plan for guerrilla war following the toppling of Saddam Hussein from power.

Following Saddam&#x27;s capture, the Ba&#x27;athist movement largely faded; its surviving factions were increasingly shifting to either nationalist factions (Iraqi, though not Pan-Arab, such as the ideology of the pre-Ba&#x27;athist regime), or Islamist (Sunni or Shia, depending on the actual faith of the individual, though Ba&#x27;ath Party policy had been secular).

As the goal of restoring the Ba&#x27;ath Party to power was seemingly out of reach, the alternative solution appeared to be to join forces with organisations who opposed the U.S.-led invasion. Many former Ba&#x27;athists had adopted an Islamist façade to attract more credibility within the country, and perhaps gain support from outside Iraq. Others, especially following the January 2005 elections, became more interested in politics.

The fall of Baghdad effectively ended the existence of the Fedayeen Saddam as an organized paramilitary. Several of its members died during the war. A large number survived, however, and were willing to carry on the fight even after the fall of Saddam Hussein from power. Many former members joined guerrilla organizations that began to form to resist the U.S-led coalition in Iraq. Some Fedayeen members fled to Syria. By June, an insurgency was underway in central and northern Iraq, especially in an area known as the Sunni Triangle. Some units of the Fedayeen also continued to operate independently of other insurgent organizations in the Sunni areas of Iraq. On 30 November 2003, a U.S. convoy traveling through the town of Samarra in the Sunni Triangle was ambushed by over 100 Iraqi guerillas, reportedly wearing trademark Fedayeen Saddam uniforms.

Following the execution of Saddam Hussein, Deputy Leader of the Iraqi-cell of the Iraqi-led Ba&#x27;ath Party and former Vice President of Iraq Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri became a leading candidate to succeed him as Leader of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party. Ad-Douri had taken over the running of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party following Saddam Hussein&#x27;s capture in 2003 and had been endorsed by a previously unknown group calling itself Baghdad Citizens Gathering. On 3 January 2007 the website of the banned Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party confirmed that he was new leader of the party.

Increasing Syrian influence in the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party may well have a major effect on result in a fragmentation of Ba&#x27;athist parts of the insurgency.

==== Iraqi nationalists (non-Ba&#x27;athist) ====
Iraqi nationalists are mostly drawn from the Arab regions. Their reasons for opposing the Coalition vary from a rejection of the Coalition presence as a matter of principle to the failure of the multinational forces to fully restore public services and to quickly restore complete sovereignty.

One notable leader of the insurgency among nationalist Sunni is former aide to Saddam Hussein and a former regional Ba&#x27;ath Party Organiser Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed al-Muwali who has been crossing the border between Iraq and Syria disbursing funds, smuggling weaponry and organising much of the fighting in the central area of Iraq.

One former minister in the interim government, Ayham al-Samarai, announced the launch in 2005 of &quot;a new political movement, saying he aimed to give a voice to figures from the legitimate Iraqi resistance. &#x27;The birth of this political bloc is to silence the skeptics who say there is no legitimate Iraqi resistance and that they cannot reveal their political face,&#x27; he told a news conference.&quot; It is unclear what became of this movement.

=== Shia militias ===

==== Government inefficacy and Iranian support ====
The Shia militias have presented Nouri al-Maliki with perhaps the greatest conundrum of his administration given the capture of Amarah. American officials have pressed him hard to disarm the militias and rid the state security forces of their influence.

A 2008 report by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point based on reports from the interrogations of dozens of captured Shia fighters described an Iranian-run network smuggling Shia fighters into Iran where they received training and weapons before returning to Iraq.

==== Badr Organization ====
One major Shia militia in Iraq is the Badr Organization, the military wing of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq. The group is currently based in Karbala, Iraq, and is also active in areas throughout southern Iraq. The group was formed by the Iranian Government to fight the Saddam Hussein-controlled Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War. Originally, the group consisted of Iraqi exiles who were banished from Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein. After the war ended in 1988, the organization remained in Iran until Saddam Hussein was overthrown during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the invasion, the brigade then moved into Iraq, became members of the new Iraq Army, and aided coalition forces in insurgents.

Colonel Derek Harvey told Reuters &quot;that the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that &#x27;this stuff had to play itself out&#x27; – implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi&#x27;ite groups were to be expected. He also said Badr and ISCI offered intelligence and advice to U.S. officials on how to navigate Iraqi politics.&quot;

In a letter published by the Coalition in February 2004, an insurgent believed to be Zarqawi wrote that jihadis should start an open sectarian war so that Sunnis would mobilize against what would otherwise be a secret war being waged by Shia. The author only specifically pointed to assassinations carried out by the Badr Brigade as an example of this secret war.

In December 2005, the group and their leaders in the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq participated in parliament elections, under the pro-Shiite coalition known as the United Iraqi Alliance, and managed to get 36 members into the Iraqi Parliament.

The Badr organization supports the government of Nouri Al-Maliki.

==== Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi Army ====
Supporters of the young Shi&#x27;a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr are largely impoverished men from the Shi&#x27;a urban areas and slums in Baghdad and the southern Shi&#x27;a cities. The Mahdi Army area of operation stretches from Basra in the south to the Sadr City section of Baghdad in central Iraq (some scattered Shi&#x27;a militia activity has also been reported in Baquba and Kirkuk, where Shi&#x27;a minorities exist).

During his group&#x27;s active militant phase, Al-Sadr enjoyed wide support from the Iraqi people according to some polls. A poll by the Iraq Center for Research and Studies found that 32% of Iraqis &quot;strongly supported&quot; him and another 36% &quot;somewhat supported&quot; him, making him the second most popular man in Iraq, behind only Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani. The Mahdi Army is believed to have around 60,000 members.

After the December 2005 elections in Iraq, Al-Sadr&#x27;s party got 32 new seats giving him substantial political power in the divided Iraqi Parliament. In January 2006, he used these seats to swing the vote for prime minister to Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, giving Al-Sadr a legitimate stake in the new Iraqi government and allying Al-Jaafari with the cleric.

On 27 November 2006, a senior American intelligence official told reporters that the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah had been training members of the Mahdi Army. The official said that 1,000 to 2,000 fighters from the Mahdi Army and other Shia militias had been trained by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and a small number of Hezbollah operatives have also visited Iraq to help with training. Iran has facilitated the link between Hezbollah and the Shia militias in Iraq, the official said. &quot;There seems to have been a strategic decision taken sometime over late winter or early spring by Damascus, Tehran, along with their partners in ait Lebanese Hezbollah, to provide more support to Sadr to increase pressure on the U.S.,&quot; the American intelligence official said.

=== Foreign participants ===
When Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, several documents were found in his possession. One particular document, which was apparently written after he lost power, appeared to be a directive to his Ba&#x27;athist loyalists warning them to be wary of Islamist mujahideen and other foreign Arabs entering the country to join the insurgency. The directive supposedly shows Saddam having concerns that foreign fighters would not share the same objectives as Ba&#x27;ath loyalists (i.e. the eventual return of Saddam to power and the restoration of his regime). A U.S. official commenting on the document stressed that while Saddam urged his followers to be cautious in their dealings with other Arab fighters, he did not order them to avoid contact or rule out co-operation. Bruce Hoffman, a Washington counter-terrorism expert stated that the existence of the document underscores the fact that &quot;this is an insurgency cut of many different cloths...[and] everybody&#x27;s jockeying for their position of power in the future Iraq.&quot; Many experts believe that fighters from other countries who have flocked to Iraq to join the insurgents are motivated by animosity toward the United States and the desire to install an Islamic state in place of the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s secular regime.

Foreign fighters are mostly Arabs from neighboring countries, who have entered Iraq, primarily through the porous desert borders of Syria and Saudi Arabia, to assist the Iraqi insurgency. Many of these fighters are Wahhabi fundamentalists who see Iraq as the new &quot;field of jihad&quot; in the battle against U.S. forces. It is generally believed that most are freelance fighters, but a few members of Al-Qaeda and the related group Ansar al-Islam are suspected of infiltrating into the Sunni areas of Iraq through the mountainous northeastern border with Iran. The United States and its allies point to Jordanian-born Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as the key player in this group. Zarqawi was considered the head of an insurgent group called Al-Tawhid Wal-Jihad (&quot;Monotheism and Holy War&quot;) until his death on 7 June 2006, which according to U.S. estimates numbers in the low hundreds.

Usage of the term &quot;foreign fighters&quot; has received criticism as being Western-centric because, taken literally, the term would encompass all non-Iraqi forces, including Coalition forces. Zarqawi has taken to taunting the American forces about the irony of the term: &quot;Who is the foreigner, O cross worshippers? You are the ones who came to the land of the Muslims from your distant corrupt land.&quot; (Communiqué of 10 May 2005). Zarqawi&#x27;s group has since announced the formation of the Ansar platoon, a squad of Iraqi suicide bombers, which an AP writer called &quot;an apparent bid to deflect criticism that most suicide bombers in Iraq are foreigners.&quot;

While it is not known how many of those fighting the U.S. forces in Iraq are from outside the country, it is generally agreed that foreign fighters make up a very small percentage of the insurgency. Major General Joseph Taluto, head of the 42nd Infantry Division, said that &quot;99.9 per cent&quot; of captured Insurgents are Iraqi. The estimate has been confirmed by the Pentagon&#x27;s own figures; in one analysis of over 1000 insurgents captured in Fallujah, only 15 were non-Iraqi. According to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, information from military commanders engaging in battles around Ramadi exposed the fact that out of 1300 suspected insurgents arrested in five months of 2005, none were foreign, although Colonel John L. Gronski stated that foreigners provided money and logistical support: &quot;The foreign fighters are staying north of the [Euphrates] river, training and advising, like the Soviets were doing in Vietnam&quot;

In September 2006, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; reported, &quot;It&#x27;s true that foreign fighters are in Iraq, such as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. But they are a small minority of the insurgents, say administration critics. Most Iraqi mujahideen are Sunnis who fear their interests will be ignored under Iraq&#x27;s Shia-dominated government. They are fighting for concrete, local political goals – not the destruction of America.&quot; The paper quoted University of Michigan history professor Juan Cole: &quot;If the Iraqi Sunni nationalists could take over their own territory, they would not put up with the few hundred foreign volunteers blowing things up, and would send them away or slit their throats.&quot; In 2005, the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded that foreign fighters accounted for less than 10% of the estimated 30,000 insurgents and argued that the U.S. and Iraqi Governments were &quot;feeding the myth&quot; that they comprised the backbone of the insurgency.

Despite the low numbers of foreign fighters their presence has been confirmed in several ways and Coalition forces believe the majority of suicide bombings are believed to be carried out by non-Iraqi foreigners. Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East expert with the Congressional Research Service, stated in June 2005: &quot;I still think 80 percent of the Insurgents, the day-to-day activity, is Iraqi – the roadside bombings, mortars, direct weapons fire, rifle fire, automatic weapons fire...[but] the foreign fighters attract the headlines with the suicide bombings, no question.&quot;

In September 2005, Iraqi and U.S. forces conducted a counter-insurgency operation in the predominantly Turkmen town of Tal Afar. According to an AP, report, an Iraqi Army Captain claimed that Iraqi forces arrested 150 non-Iraqi Arabs (Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Jordan) in the operation; the American army claimed 20% of arrests were foreign combatants, while Donald Rumsfeld on PBS confirmed that foreign combatants were present. However, not all accounts of the battle mention these arrests, and U.S. Army commander Colonel H. R. McMaster said the &quot;vast majority&quot; of Insurgents captured there were &quot;Iraqis and not foreigners.&quot; Iraqi journalist Nasir Ali claimed that there were &quot;very few foreign combatants&quot; in Tal Afar and charged &quot;Every time the US army and the Iraqi government want to destroy a specific city, they claim it hosts Arab fighters and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.&quot;

There are allegations that the U.S. government has attempted to inflate the number of foreign fighters in order to advance the theory that the insurgency is not a local movement. U.S. Army Specialist Tony Lagouranis spoke about his job identifying many of the bodies after the assault on Fallujah:

==== Foreign fighters&#x27; nationality distribution ====
In July 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported that 45% of all foreign militants targeting U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians and security forces are from Saudi Arabia; 15% are from Syria and Lebanon; and 10% are from North Africa. 50% of all Saudi fighters in Iraq come as suicide bombers. In the six months preceding that article, such bombings have killed or injured 4,000 Iraqis.

According to a U.S. military press briefing on 20 October 2005, 312 foreign nationals from 27 countries had been captured in Iraq from April to October 2005. This represents a component of the Iraqi insurgent movement, which also includes a nationalist movement encompassing over 30 Shia and Sunni militias.

Foreign insurgents captured in Iraq in the 7-month period April–October 2005:
==== Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Sunni jihadists ====

The extent of Zarqawi&#x27;s influence is a source of much controversy. Zarqawi was reported killed in action in March 2004 in &quot;a statement signed by a dozen alleged insurgent groups&quot;. His Jordanian family then held a funeral service on his behalf, although no body was recovered and positively identified. Iraqi leaders denied the presence of Zarqawi in Fallujah prior to the U.S. attack on that city in November 2004. Zarqawi&#x27;s existence was even questioned.

Involvement of Zarqawi in significant terrorist incidents was not usually proven, although his group often claimed it perpetrated bombings. As al-Qaeda is an &quot;opt-in&quot; group (meaning everyone who agrees to some basic Wahhabi moral tenets and the fundamental goals may consider himself a member), it is most likely that &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq&quot; is a loose association of largely independent cells united by a common strategy and vision, rather than a unified organization with a firm internal structure.

On 8 June 2006, Iraqi officials confirmed Zarqawi was killed by two 500 lb laser-guided bombs dropped from an F-16 the previous evening. Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an Egyptian who was trained in Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan took his place.

A document found in Zarqawi&#x27;s safe house indicates that the guerrilla group was trying to provoke the U.S. to attack Iran in order to reinvigorate the resistance in Iraq and to weaken American forces in Iraq. &quot;The question remains, how to draw the Americans into fighting a war against Iran? It is not known whether American is serious in its animosity towards Iraq, because of the big support Iran is offering to America in its war in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Hence, it is necessary first to exaggerate the Iranian danger and to convince America and the west in general, of the real danger coming from Iran...&quot;. The document then outlines 6 ways to incite war between the two nations. Iraqi national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie said the document, shows al-Qaeda in Iraq is in &quot;pretty bad shape.&quot; He added that &quot;we believe that this is the beginning of the end of al-Qaeda in Iraq.&quot;

Journalist Jill Carroll, detailing her captivity in Iraq, described one of her captors who identified himself as Abdullah Rashid and leader of the Mujahideen Shura Council in Iraq. He told her that; &quot;The Americans were constantly saying that the mujahideen in Iraq were led by foreigners... So, the Iraqi insurgents went to Zarqawi and insisted that an Iraqi be put in charge.&quot; She continued by stating; &quot;But as I saw in coming weeks, Zarqawi remained the insurgents&#x27; hero, and the most influential member of their council, whatever Nour/Rashid&#x27;s position... At various times, I heard my captors discussing changes in their plans because of directives from the council and Zarqawi.&quot;

==== Schism between foreign fighters and native Iraqi insurgency ====
Large-scale terrorist attacks against civilians carried out by foreign fighters, as well as the interpretation of Islam that they attempt to impose on the local population in areas under their control, have increasingly turned Iraqis against them, in some cases breaking out into open fighting between different groups in the insurgency. There are signs that local Islamist insurgent groups have also increasingly caused the population to turn against them.

Opinions differ on how broad this schism is. Terrorism expert Jessica Stern warned that; &quot;In the run-up to the war, most Iraqis viewed the foreign volunteers who were rushing in to fight against America as troublemakers, and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s forces reportedly killed many of them.&quot; This opinion contradicts Iraqi scholar Mustapha Alani, who says that these foreigners are increasingly welcomed by the public, especially in the former Ba&#x27;athist strongholds north of Baghdad.

While some have noted an alliance of convenience that existed between the foreign fighters and the native Sunni insurgents, there are signs that the foreign militants, especially those who follow Zarqawi, are increasingly unpopular among the native fighters. In the run-up to the December 2005 elections, Sunni fighters were warning al-Qaeda members and foreign fighters not to attack polling stations. One former Ba&#x27;athist told Reuters; &quot;Sunnis should vote to make political gains. We have sent leaflets telling al-Qaeda that they will face us if they attack voters.&quot; An unnamed Sunni leader was quoted commenting on Zarqawi; &quot;Zarqawi is an American, Israeli and Iranian agent who is trying to keep our country unstable so that the Sunnis will keep facing occupation.&quot;

By early 2006, the split between the Sunni groups and the Zarqawi-led foreign fighters had grown dramatically, and Sunni forces began targeting al-Qaeda forces for assassination. One senior intelligence official told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that Zarqawi had fled to Iran as a result of the attacks. In response to al-Qaeda killings in Iraq, Sunni insurgents in al-Anbar province led by former Ba&#x27;athist intelligence officer Ahmed Ftaikhan formed an anti-al-Qaeda militia called the Anbar Revolutionaries. All of the militia&#x27;s core members have relatives who have been killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq, and they have sought to prevent foreign jihadis from entering the country. The group &quot;claims to have killed 20 foreign fighters and 33 Iraqi sympathizers.&quot; The schism became all the more apparent in when a tape alleged to be from the Mujahedeen Shura Council urged Osama Bin Laden to replace al-Qaeda in Iraq&#x27;s current head with an Iraqi national. The Mujahedeen Shura Council, however, issued a statement shortly afterwards denying the authenticity of this tape.

On 19 July 2007 seven domestic insurgent groups informed journalists in Damascus that they were forming a united front independent of al-Qaeda.

=== Covert Iranian military involvement ===
An estimated 150 Iranian intelligence officers, plus members of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are believed to be active inside Iraq at any given time. For more than a year, U.S. troops have detained and recorded fingerprints, photographs, and DNA samples from dozens of suspected Iranian agents in a catch and release program designed to intimidate the Iranian leadership. Iranian influence is felt most heavily within the Iraqi Government, the ISF, and Shiite militias.

Although the CPA enforced a 1987 law banning unions in public enterprises, trade unions such as the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) and Iraq&#x27;s Union of the Unemployed have also mounted effective opposition to the Coalition. However, no trades unions support the armed insurgents, and unions have themselves been subject to attacks from the insurgents. Hadi Saleh of the IFTU was assassinated under circumstances that pointed to a Ba&#x27;athist insurgent group on 3 January 2005. Another union federation, the General Union of Oil Employees (GUOE) opposes the Coalition forces in Iraq and calls for immediate withdrawal but was neutral on participation in the election. Whereas the GUOE wants all Coalition troops out immediately, both the IFTU and the Workers Councils&#x27; call for replacement of U.S. and British forces with neutral forces from the UN, the Arab League and other nations as a transition.
== Tactics ==

The tactics of the Iraqi insurgency vary widely. The majority of militant elements use improvised explosive devices (IEDs), car bombs, kidnappings, hostage-taking, shootings, ambushes, sniper attacks, mortar and rocket strikes and other types of attacks to target Iraqis and U.S. forces with little regard for civilian casualties.
== Awareness of American public opinion ==
A single study has compared the number of insurgent attacks in Iraq to supposedly negative statements in the U.S. media, release of public opinion polls, and geographic variations in access to international media by Iraqis. The purpose was to determine if there was a link between insurgent activity and media reports. The researchers&#x27; study suggested it may be possible that insurgent attacks spiked by 5 to 10% after increases in the number of negative reports of the war in the media. The authors believe this may possibly be an &quot;emboldenment effect&quot; and speculated that &quot;insurgent groups respond rationally to expected probability of US withdrawal.&quot;

== Iraqi public opinion ==
A series of several polls have been conducted to ascertain the position of the Iraqi public further on Al Qaeda in Iraq and the U.S. presence. Some polls have found the following:
* Polls suggest the majority of Iraqis disapprove of the presence of Coalition forces.
* A majority of both Sunnis and Shi&#x27;as want an end to the U.S. presence as soon as possible, although Sunnis are opposed to the Coalition soldiers being there by greater margins.
* Polls suggest the vast majority of Iraqis support attacks on insurgent groups with 80% supporting US attacks on Al-Qaeda.

Directly after the invasion, polling suggested that a slight majority supported the US invasion. However polls conducted in June 2005 suggest that there is some sentiment towards Coalition armies being in Iraq. A 2005 poll by British intelligence said that 45% of Iraqis support attacks against Coalition forces, rising to 65% in some areas, and that 82% are &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to the presence of Coalition troops. Demands for U.S. withdrawal have also been signed on by one third of Iraq&#x27;s Parliament. These results are consistent with a January 2006 poll that found an overall 47% approval for attacks on U.S.-led forces. That figure climbed to 88% among Sunnis. Attacks on Iraqi security forces and civilians, however, were approved of by only 7% and 12% of respondents respectively. Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqi&#x27;s wanted US and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead.

A September 2006 poll of both Sunnis and Shias found that 71% of Iraqis wanted the U.S. to leave within a year, with 65% favoring an immediate pullout and 77% voicing suspicion that the U.S. wanted to keep permanent bases in Iraq. 61% approved of attacks on U.S. forces. A later poll in March 2007 suggests the percentage of Iraqis who approve of attacks on Coalition forces has dropped to 51%. In 2006 a poll conducted on the Iraqi public revealed that 52% of the ones polled said Iraq was going in the wrong direction and 61% claimed it was worth ousting Saddam Hussein.

Despite a majority having previously been opposed to the US presence, 60% of Iraqis opposed American troops leaving directly prior to withdrawal, with 51% saying withdrawal would have a negative effect.

== Scope and size of the insurgency ==

The most intense Sunni insurgent activity takes place in the cities and countryside along the Euphrates River from the Syrian border town of al-Qaim through Ramadi and Fallujah to Baghdad, as well as along the Tigris river from Baghdad north to Tikrit. Heavy guerrilla activity also takes place around the cities of Mosul and Tal Afar in the north, as well as the &quot;Triangle of Death&quot; south of Baghdad, which includes the &quot;-iya&quot; cities of Iskandariya, Mahmudiya, Latifiya, and Yusufiya. Lesser activity takes place in several other areas of the country. The insurgents are believed to maintain a key supply line stretching from Syria through al-Qaim and along the Euphrates to Baghdad and central Iraq, the Iraqi equivalent of the Ho Chi Minh trail. A second &quot;ratline&quot; runs from the Syrian border through Tal Afar to Mosul.

Although estimates of the total number of Iraqi guerrillas varies by group and fluctuates under changing political climate, the latest assessments put the present number at between 3,000 and 7,000 fighters along with numerous supporters and facilitators throughout the Sunni Arab community. At various points U.S. forces provided estimates on the number of fighters in specific regions. A few are provided here (although these numbers almost certainly have fluctuated):
* Fallujah (mid-2004): 2,000–5,000 In a November 2004 operation, the Fallujah insurgency has been destroyed or dispersed, but had staged a comeback in 2005, albeit not to former strength, in the course of 2005–2008 the remainder of the insurgency was defeated in Fallujah and the rest of Al-Anbar province.
* Samarra (August 2011): 1,000+
* Baquba (August 2011 ): 1,000+
* Baghdad (August 2011): 2,000+
Guerilla forces operate in many of the cities and towns of al-Anbar province, due to mostly ineffective Iraqi security forces in this area. There was extensive guerrilla activity in Ramadi, the capital of the province, as well as al-Qa&#x27;im, the first stop on an insurgent movement route between Iraq and Syria. In 2006, reports suggested that the Anbar capital Ramadi had largely fallen under insurgent control along with most of the Anbar region, and that as a result the United States had sent an extra 3,500 marines to reestablish control of the region. In the early part of 2007 the insurgency suffered serious setbacks in Ramadi after they were defeated in the Second Battle of Ramadi in the fall of 2006. With the help of the Anbar Salvation Council, incidents fell from an average of 30 attacks per day in December 2006 to an average of fewer than four in April 2007.

Baghdad is still one of the most violent regions of the country, even after the 2007 troop surge more than two-thirds of the violence that takes place in Iraq happens in Baghdad even though the Iraqi Government is in firm control of the entire city. Suicide attacks and car bombs are near daily occurrences in Baghdad. The road from Baghdad to the city airport is the most dangerous in the country, if not the world. Iraqi security and police forces had also been significantly built up in the capital and, despite being constantly targeted, had enjoyed some successes such as the pacification of Haifa Street, which however subsequently saw a massive surge of insurgent activity. and after the failed Coalition Operation Together Forward fell under Sunni insurgent control. The U.S. and Iraqi Forces scored many decisive victories in 2007 during the U.S. troops surge when they launched Operation Law and Order and Operation Phantam Thunder which broke the back of the insurgency and has since the saw a mass reduction in violence by 80 percent since then.

Recent intelligence suggests that the base of foreign paramilitary operations has moved from Anbar to the religiously and ethnically mixed Diyala province. By July 2007 Diyala had fallen under almost total Insurgent control, and had become the headquarters for the Sunni-dominated Islamic State of Iraq, which has issued a proclamation declaring the regional capital Baqubah its capital.

In response to a law allowing for the partitioning of Iraq into autonomous regions, members of the Mutayibeen Coalition (&quot;Khalf al-Mutayibeen&quot;), a coalition of Sunni insurgent groups including Al Qaeda in Iraq, announced the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq encompassing parts of 6 of Iraq&#x27;s 18 provinces on 15 October 2006. Yet another show of defiance came on 18 October when Sunni fighters brazenly paraded in Ramadi. Similar parades were held two days later in several towns across western Iraq, two of which occurred within two miles of U.S. military bases.

By October 2006, small radicalized militias had seemed to overshadow the larger and more organized Sunni groups which had composed the insurgency previously. As disagreements emerged in pre-existing groups for reasons ranging from the rift in the Sunni forces between foreign and Iraqi fighters, competition between Mahdi Army and Badr Brigade, and anger over various decisions such as Muqtada al Sadr&#x27;s agreement to join the political process, dozens of insurgency groups sprung up across the country, though particularly in Baghdad where the U.S. army has listed 23 active militias. Residents have described the capital as being a patchwork of militia run fiefs. As a result of the insurgency&#x27;s splintering nature, many established leaders seemed to lose influence. This was particularly illustrated on 19 October, when members of the Mahdi army briefly seized control of Amarah. The attack, while demonstrating the influence of the Madhi army, is believed to have originated as a result of contention between local units of the Madhi army and the allegedly Badr brigade run security forces, and the timing suggested that neither Al Sadr nor his top commanders had known or orchestrated the offensive.

At the height of the war, insurgents launched hundreds of attacks each month against Coalition forces. Overtime, insurgency groups moved to more sophisticated methods of attack such as Explosively formed penetrators, and infrared lasers, which cannot be easily jammed. These attacks contributed to the rate of civilian casualties which in turn reduced Iraq&#x27;s public safety as well as the reliability of infrastructure.

As of 29 January 2009 4,235 U.S. soldiers, 178 British soldiers and 139 soldiers from other nations (allied with the coalition) have died in Iraq. 31,834 U.S. soldiers had been wounded. Coalition forces do not usually release death counts. As such, the exact number of insurgents killed by the Coalition or Iraqi forces is unknown. Through September 2007 more than 19,000 insurgents were reported to have been killed in fighting with Coalition forces and tens of thousands of Iraqi &quot;suspected civilians&quot; were captured (including 25,000 detainees in U.S. military custody at the time), according to military statistics released for the first time.

== American-led counter-insurgency operations ==
Over 500 counterinsurgency operations have been undertaken by the U.S.-led Coalition or the Iraqi government. These include Operation Option North and Operation Bayonet Lightning in Kirkuk, Operation Desert Thrust, Operation Abilene and Operation All American Tiger throughout Iraq, Operation Iron Hammer in Baghdad and Operation Ivy Blizzard in Samarra – all in 2003; Operation Market Sweep, Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury in Fallujah in 2004; Operation Matador in Anbar, Operation Squeeze Play and Operation Lightning in Baghdad, Operation New Market near Haditha, Operation Spear in Karabillah and the Battle of Tal Afar – all in 2005; Operation Swarmer in Samarra and Operation Together Forward in Baghdad in 2006; and Operation Law and Order in Baghdad, Operation Arrowhead Ripper in Baqouba and Operation Phantom Strike throughout Iraq – all in 2007.

<text>The Ironbound is a neighborhood in the city of Newark in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a large working-class multi-ethnic community, covering about . Historically, the area was called &quot;Dutch Neck,&quot; &quot;Down Neck,&quot; or simply &quot;the Neck,&quot; for its location by a bend of the Passaic River. Part of Newark&#x27;s East Ward, the Ironbound is directly east of Newark Penn Station and Downtown Newark, and south and west of the river. The neighborhood is connected by the Jackson Street Bridge over the river to Harrison and Kearny.

==Early history==
The area was mostly farmland until the 1830s, when industry and immigration began increasing at a rapid pace.

The name &quot;The Ironbound&quot; is said to derive from the large metalworking industry in the area or from the network of railroad tracks that surrounded the neighborhood.

=== Industry ===
The Ironbound was an industrial neighborhood in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The neighborhood was home to Hensler&#x27;s Beer Brewery, P. Ballantine and Sons Brewing Company (in 1954 Newark&#x27;s largest employer) and the Feigenspan Brewery. Balbach Smelting &amp; Refining Company, now the location of Riverbank Park, was the second largest metal processing enterprise in the United States until its closure in the 1920s. Other large industrial buildings included Murphy Varnish Works.

=== Immigration ===
The Ironbound has experienced several waves of immigration. The first wave, starting in the 1830s, came from the German states. Wrote historian Charles Cummings, &quot;Overnight, whole sections of the Ironbound became Irish and German&quot;. Polish and Italian immigrants arrived in the latter half of the 19th century, followed by Portuguese and Spanish starting in the 1910s. By 1921 there was a large enough Portuguese population to found Sport Club Portuguese, the first of over twenty Portuguese social clubs that would call the Ironbound home.

=== Historical landmarks ===
The following sites in the Ironbound are on the National Register of Historic Places:

* Murphy Varnish Works
* Pennsylvania Station (Newark)
* Riverbank Park
* St. Casimir&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church (Newark, New Jersey)
* St. Stephan&#x27;s Church (Ironbound, Newark, New Jersey)

==Culture and commerce==
Ferry Street is the main commercial strip in the area. In 2017, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the neighborhood as:Four square miles populated in large part by Portuguese, Spanish and Latin American immigrants and their descendants, the Ironbound has the intimacy and hustle of a European market town. “We walk to the bakery, the fishmonger, the wine store,” said [the director of the Newark Museum of Art]. (He also walks to work.) “It really is an extraordinarily agreeable lifestyle.”

===Portuguese community===
Today, the Ironbound is known for being a Portuguese neighborhood. TAP Air Portugal has its corporate office in the neighborhood. Ironbound Volunteer Ambulance Squad has been serving the community since 1952. Ironbound also has its own newspaper. Many Portuguese still live in the Ironbound, but many are moving out to other neighborhoods in New Jersey, Including South River, Livingston, Clark, Westfield, Watchung, Old Bridge, etc.

====Peter Francisco Park====
A small sitting park east of Penn Station is named in honor of Peter Francisco, a Portuguese-born patriot of the American War of Independence. An obelisk in Francisco&#x27;s memory was raised in the park by the Portuguese community in 1976. Peter Francisco Park also features a memorial to Portuguese-American war veterans dedicated in 2018 as well as the Ironbound Immigrants Memorial, dedicated in 2019.

==Festivals==
===Portugal Day festival===
Every year, people flock to the annual Portuguese Parade &amp; Festival, known as Portugal Day, &quot;Dia de Portugal&quot; (typically held the first or second weekend in June), an enormous celebration of Portuguese culture.

During Portugal Day Weekend, many people come out to celebrate Portuguese-American culture. Ferry Street is also the location for most soccer fans to come and celebrate. Fans walk up and down the street while others decorate their cars and celebrate the victory of their soccer team..

=== Ecuadorian Day festival ===
Typically held in the first or second weekend of August, the Ecuadorian Day Parade &amp; festival take place in Ferry Street. In this event various businesses and politicians attend the parade and support the Ecuadorian culture in a statewide recognized festivity.

=== Brazilian Day festival ===
Typically held in the first or second weekend of September, the Brazilian day festival takes place also in Ferry Street. Various street vendors, musical concerts, and restaurants show support for Brazilian culture.

===Italian festival===
Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Ironbound&#x27;s first Italian parish, holds an annual Italian festival.

==Demographics==

The Ironbound used to mainly consist of Italians, Polish, Portuguese, and Spaniard Immigrants. As time went on many Italian and Polish immigrants have moved out of the Ironbound. However, there are still significant numbers of residents of Italian and Polish descent residing in the Ironbound. Recent immigrants include large numbers of Brazilians and Ecuadorians. 2000s census demographics include:

57.46% White/Caucasian/European (Mainly consisting of Italian, Spanish, Polish, and other European Ethnicity)

34.94% Hispanic &amp; Latino (Mainly consisting of Ecuadorians, Etc.)

0.95% Asian/American Indian

4.68% Black/African American

1.97% Muiti-Racial

==Parks and recreation==
===Independence Park===
This park is in the Ironbound district. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, the Ironbound&#x27;s first Italian parish, faces the park. The church holds an annual Italian festival which attracts Italian-American people that live in the neighborhood, and Italians who moved out of the Ironbound.

===Riverfront Park and waterfront===

A chain of parkland along the Passaic River, especially along the downward &quot;curve&quot; in the river that gave the Ironbound neighborhood its nickname of &quot;Down Neck,&quot; offers waterfront recreation in the city. Kayaking and riverboat tours of the city are offered in the summer months. From east to west along the downward &quot;neck&quot; of the Passaic, parkland includes:
*Riverfront Park, which stretches along the Passaic River offering the &quot;Orange Boardwalk&quot; walkway paths with views of the water. Sports Illustrated Stadium may be seen looking north across the river to the Harrison bank.
*Riverbank Park in the Ironbound along the Passaic River.
*Peter Francisco Park is a small park near Penn Station in honor of the Portuguese-born Revolution-era patriot.

==Education==

===Public schools===
The Newark Public Schools operates six elementary and K-8 schools in the area. Schools serving Ironbound include Wilson Avenue School, Hawkins Street School, Lafayette Street School and Oliver Street School. In addition is Ann Street School, which is considered by many to be one of the best elementary schools in the city and the K-5 South Street School. In fact, Ann Street School received the Blue Ribbon School of Excellence from the US Department of Education. This competitive award had not been awarded to a Newark Public School before. In addition, the award prompted then Vice President of the US, Al Gore, to visit Ann Street to promote the importance of the upcoming 2000 US Census. East Side High School serves Ironbound high school students. As of 2004 most of the elementary schools were built over 100 years prior to the time. In the 2000s, an increase in housing lead to an overcrowding of Ironbound-area schools. At the time the school district planned to replace several of the elementary schools and build a new East Side High School in the former Ballantine brewery site.

===Private schools===
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark operates the Ironbound Catholic Academy, a PK-8 school in Ironbound. As of 2004 many residents of Ironbound send their children to parochial schools. Ironbound used to have three other Catholic elementary schools, including Academy of St. Benedict, a PreK-8 school, St. James, both elementary and high school, and St. Lucy Filippini Academy. In 2005 the archdiocese announced that St. Casimir, St. Benedict, and St. Lucy Filippini would merge into the Ironbound Catholic Academy on the St. Casimir site. There is also the Our Lady of Fatima Nursery, a Pre-K institution and one Portuguese Language School known at Escola Luis de Camões.

===Public libraries===
Newark Public Library&#x27;s Van Buren Branch Library serves the Ironbound neighborhood. The library opened on September 23, 1923. A renovated and expanded branch opened on November 19, 1997.

== Housing ==
About 60% of the real estate market in the Ironbound is two- and three-family houses. Many houses built by the Portuguese include tile details and aluminum siding. In the past ten to fifteen years, more luxury condos and apartments have been built in the area. Several old factory buildings have been converted into lofts or apartments including Textile Lofts, Button Factory Lofts, Murphy Varnish Factory, and the Chocolate Factory.

Ironbound has three housing projects within its boundaries: Hyatt Court, Pennington Court, and Terrell Homes (formerly Franklin Delano Roosevelt Homes). Tenants and activists have recently been in a battle with the Newark Housing Authority to save Terrell Homes, which the Authority had planned to demolish.

== Environmental justice ==
The Ironbound has a &quot;national reputation&quot; for being a leader in environmental justice led by a local community organizing and advocacy organization called the Ironbound Community Corporation (ICC) and an offshoot group the Ironbound Committee Against Toxic Waste (ICATW). ICC and ICATW have worked over the years with other local and national groups and figures such as Greenpeace, Lois Gibbs, and the Newark Coalition for Neighborhoods. Over the years they have worked on a number of environmental justice issues including airplane noise, dioxin, pollution and fumes.

In 1983, dangerous levels of dioxin were discovered at an abandoned chemical factory in the Ironbound. The Diamond Alkali Company was largely responsible for this pollution through their heavy production of Agent Orange between 1951 and 1969. The off-site cleanup was completed by 1986, and in 1989 the site received a permanent impermeable cap.

In the 1980s residents protested against a garbage incinerator in the neighborhood. The incinerator was built in 1990 but residents have continued to protest environmental issues over the years. Bright pink and purple fumes were often seen spewing from the facility but Covanta, the company operating the incinerator, blamed a local hospital for improperly disposed medical waste. In summer 2019, ICC partnered with Earthjustice, a nonprofit public interest organization that litigates to protect the environment, and the Environmental Advocacy Clinic at Vermont Law School urged state officials to investigate. Covanta has been found many hundreds of times to exceed air pollution limits or to fail to abide by required safety regulations. Covanta eventually acknowledged that the fumes were produced by its burning of pesticides improperly disposed and agreed to new waste management procedures.

<doc id="847632" wikidata="Q977758" url="?curid=847632" title="John Hamilton Gray (New Brunswick politician)">
<text>John Hamilton Gray, (1814 – June 5, 1889) was a politician in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada, a jurist, and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He should not be confused with John Hamilton Gray, a Prince Edward Island politician (and also a Father of Confederation) in the same era.

Gray was born in St. George&#x27;s, Bermuda, British North America. His father, William, was naval commissary in Bermuda and later served as British consul in Norfolk, Virginia. Gray&#x27;s grandfather, Joseph Gray, was a United Empire Loyalist from Boston who settled in Halifax, Nova Scotia following the American Revolution. His cousin, Samuel Brownlow Gray (1823–1910), the grandfather of Captain Gerald Hamilton Gray (1883–1953) of the Royal Garrison Artillery and Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Wentworth Gray of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians), was appointed Attorney-General of Bermuda in 1861 and the Chief Justice of Bermuda in 1900.

John Hamilton Gray was educated at King&#x27;s College in Nova Scotia after which he became a lawyer in Saint John, New Brunswick. He also served as a captain in the New Brunswick Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry becoming a major in the Queen&#x27;s New Brunswick Ranger by 1850. In 1854 he became lieutenant-colonel of the regiment.

Politically, Gray was a high Tory Conservative but also a moderate reformer. He joined the New Brunswick Colonial Association after it was founded in 1849. Gray moved a motion calling for a &quot;federal union of the British North American colonies, preparatory to their immediate independence.&quot; The motion was defeated but was an anticipation of Canadian confederation. Gray was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as a supporter of the Colonial Association&#x27;s platform of reforms in opposition to the Compact government. Lieutenant Governor Edmund Walker Head appointed Gray to the Executive Council causing the reform opposition to collapse and ending Gray&#x27;s career as a Liberal. He was created a Queen&#x27;s Counsel In 1853.

Gray became leader of the Conservatives in the Legislative Assembly and found himself leader of the opposition after the 1854 elections, the first held under responsible government, elected a Liberal (or Reform) administration ending &quot;compact&quot; government. In 1855, Lieutenant-Governor John Manners-Sutton dismissed the Reform government over its attempt to institute prohibition and asked Gray to form an administration.

As Premier, Gray led the Conservatives to victory in the June 1856 election on an anti-prohibition platform and repealed the liquor law. However, with the central issue uniting his government now resolved he became unable to command a majority in the legislature and resigned in May 1857.

Gray continued in opposition as a Conservative MLA. He also led committees of inquiry into railway construction and investigated allegations of patronage and corruption but he concluded that the railway was &quot;sound&quot;. After 1860, Gray drifted away from his fellow Conservatives and became supportive of Samuel Leonard Tilley&#x27;s Liberal government but was defeated in the 1861 election for his efforts.

Out of elected politics, Gray returned to his practice as a lawyer and was appointed to an inquiry board on the land question in Prince Edward Island.

Gray became an active supporter of Canadian Confederation and joined Tilley&#x27;s new Liberal-Conservative Party returning to the legislature in a by-election in 1864. Gray served as a delegate to the Charlottetown Conference only to return to New Brunswick to face growing hostility to the confederation project and lost his seat in the 1865 election that brought the Anti-Confederation Party to power. Gray returned to the legislature in 1866 and served as Speaker. When confederation became a reality, Gray won a seat in the House of Commons.

He did not run for re-election in 1872. He was appointed judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and moved west reluctantly. He served on the 1885 Royal Commission on Chinese immigration.

On the court, Gray ruled in 1878 that the province&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Tax Act&quot; was unconstitutional as its purpose was to &quot;drive the Chinese from the country, thus interfering at once with the authority reserved to the Dominion Parliament as to the regulation of the trade and commerce, the rights of aliens, and the treaties of the empire.&quot;

He was a Freemason of Albion Lodge No. 500 in Saint John, New Brunswick, and Civil Service Lodge No. 148 in Ottawa.

John Hamilton Gray died in Victoria, British Columbia and is interred there in the Ross Bay Cemetery. He is the only father of confederation buried west of Ontario.

<doc id="847637" wikidata="Q578438" url="?curid=847637" title="Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)">
<text>The Supreme Justice Tribunal ( or TSJ) is the highest court of law in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is the head of the judicial branch. As the independence of the Venezuelan judiciary under the regime of Nicolás Maduro is questioned, there have recently been many disputes as to whether this court is legitimate.

The Supreme Tribunal may meet either in specialized chambers (of which there are six: constitutional, political/administrative, electoral, civil, criminal, and social) or in plenary session. Each chamber has five judges, except the constitutional, which has seven. Its main function is to control, according to the constitution and related laws, the constitutionality and legality of public acts.

The Supreme Tribunal&#x27;s 32 magistrates &quot;(magistrados)&quot; are appointed by the National Assembly and serve non-renewable 12-year terms. Appointments are made by a two-thirds majority, or a simple majority if efforts to appoint a judge fail three times in a row. Under article 265 of the 1999 Constitution, judges may be removed by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly, if the Attorney General, Comptroller General, and Human Rights Ombudsperson have previously agreed to a &quot;serious failure&quot; and suspended the judge accordingly.

==History and controversies==
The Tribunal was created under the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela, replacing the Supreme Court of Venezuela. For some years provisional statutes regulated the number of judges – initially 20, with three in each chamber except the constitutional, which had five – and their selection. The statutes were replaced in 2004 by an organic law (a law required to clarify constitutional provisions). The law also permitted the National Assembly to revoke the appointment of a judge, by a simple majority, where a judge had provided false information as to their credentials.

=== 2002 coup d&#x27;état ===
In a controversial sentence, on 14 August 2002, after the 2002 Venezuela coup d&#x27;état, the Supreme Tribunal acquitted Division Generals Efraín Vásquez (Army) and Pedro Pereira (Aviation), Vice-admirant Héctor Ramírez and Counter admiral Daniel Comisso in a rebellion trial. According to the sentence, &quot;con los pronunciamientos efectuados en abril, los altos oficiales acusados no desconocieron al Gobierno, sino la orden dictada por el presidente de la República de aplicar el Plan Ávila, porque resultaba contraria a la protección de los derechos humanos de la ciudadanía y ello significaría una masacre&quot;.(With the pronouncements made in April, the accused high-ranking officials did not ignore the Government, but the order issued by the President of the Republic to apply the Avila Plan, because it was contrary to the protection of the human rights of citizens and this would mean a massacre.)

The sentence argued that there was a &quot;power vacuum&quot; after the Military High Command chief, General Lucas Rincón announced that Chávez had resigned from office. The discontent of the Venezuelan government was considerable; Chávez condemned the sentenced, stating &quot;Esos once magistrados no tienen moral para tomar ningún otro tipo de decisión, son unos inmorales y deberían publicar un libro con sus rostros para que el pueblo los conozca. Pusieron la plasta&quot;.(Those eleven magistrates have no moral to make any other kind of decision, they are immoral and should publish a book with their faces so that the people know them. They put the plasta). Chávez announced a strategy to revert the decision, creating a commission in the National Assembly to review the stay of the justices in the Supreme Tribunal, saying that &quot;No nos vamos a quedar con esa, ahora lo que viene es un contraataque del pueblo y de las instituciones verdaderas, contraataque revolucionario&quot; and that &quot;Así que la AN que los nombró tiene que asumir su tarea, para evaluarlos y el que no tenga los requisitos habrá que sacarlo de allí&quot;.(We are not going to stay with that, now what is coming is a counterattack of the people and the real institutions, revolutionary counterattack&quot; and that &quot;So the AN that appointed them has to assume its task, to evaluate them and whoever does not have the requirements will have to be removed from there.)

The result was a new Supreme Tribunal of Justice Law with two purposes: establishing a procedure to suspend justices and increasing the number of justices from 20 to 30. The following year, the executive branch managed to promote the increase to 32 justices, after which the Tribunal started the reviewed the original sentence. On 14 March 2005, the Tribunal overruled the decision. The opposition considers that the override of the sentence was caused by the changes made to the high court by a legislation change by lawmakers of the ruling party, which had a majority at the time. Government supporters consider that the first sentence was political and there were several reasons to start a trial of a coup d&#x27;état.

=== 2006 judicial year beginning ===
During the 2006 judicial year beginning, the justices of the Supreme Tribunal stood up from the seats of the Criminal Chamber to chant &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;Uh, ah, Chávez won&#x27;t go!&quot;), while president Chávez was present in the auditorium. The act was interpreted as a demonstration of political partiality by the justices and the institution.

=== Open letter of former Justice Eladio Aponte Aponte ===
On 20 August 2009, drug trafficker Walid Makled was captured in Cúcuta by the Colombian Administrative Department of Security (DAS) and later moved to Bogotá. Walid was requested by both the American and the Venezuelan anti-narcotics authorities. During his arrest, Makled was found with a credential of the Venezuelan military prosecution, allegedly issued by the Supreme Tribunal justice Eladio Aponte Aponte. Venezuela&#x27;s opposition&#x27;s spokesperson, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, declared that the investigation would be obstructed in the country by the very public officials.

On 16 April 2012, Aponte wrote an open letter from San José, Costa Rica, in which he claimed to have received orders and pressure from president Hugo Chávez to convict Iván Simonovis, security chief of the Metropolitan District of Caracas, as well as Caracas Metropolitan Police officers Henry Vivas and Lázaro Forero, applying the maximum sentence for their participation during the Llaguno Overpass events. The letter was published in September.
Aponte fled Venezuela to Costa Rica in April 2012 after being accused of assisting Makled who said he had been paying Aponte US$70,000 per month related to joint business ventures. Aponte then contacted the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration which provided him with a flight to the United States.

=== 2015 justices appointment ===
, for a part of Venezuelan society, the legitimacy of the Supreme Tribunal is in question, especially the legitimacy of its origin, due to the appointment on 23 December 2015 of 13 main justices and 21 supplementary justices by a lame duck National Assembly with a ruling party majority, as well as its actions since. Article 264 of the Venezuelan Constitution and Title V of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice Organic Law contemplate an extense procedure of more than thirty days for the appointment of the justices, both main and alternate, in which it is required to form a Judicial Nominations Committee integrated by members of the National Assembly and civil society, which will do a preselection of candidates that will be submitted to the Republican Moral Council: the Ombudsman, the Public Ministry and the Comptroller General, which will do a second preselection that in turn will be submitted to the National Assembly, which will have a lapse of three plenary sessions to appoint the justices with the vote of two thirds of the deputies or a fourth plenary session with the vote of a simple majority in case of not getting two thirds of the vote. The appointment of the justices was not done in accordance with the legal procedure, but with a hurried process carried out on 23 December 2015 by the lame duck National Assembly with a ruling party majority, when the legislature ended on 15 December, after being defeated on the 2015 parliamentary election, where the opposition, represented by the Democratic Unity Roundtable opposition coalition, gained 112 of the 167 seats.

During the process, the &quot;Citizen branch&quot; issued a list of preselected candidates of previous processes, endorsed by the Ombudsman Tarek William Saab and the Comptroller Manuel Galindo. The National Assembly approved the candidates in a single plenary session on the night of 23 December 2015.

Both the opposition and several jurists have described the appointment as illegal for not being performed according to the constitution and the Organic Law, including the challenges period, their lack of responses and the omission of the definite selections of the candidates. According to a mid 2016 report issued by the Venezuelan NGO &quot;Acceso a la Justicia&quot; (Access to Justice), only one of seven justices of the Constitutional Chamber comply with the requirements for the position demanded by Venezuelan laws and their designation process was irregular.

On 14 June 2016 the National Assembly nullified the appointment carried out in 2015.

=== Challenge of electoral results ===
Weeks after the parliamentary elections and after the oathtaking of the elected representatives in the National Assembly, seven complaints were presented to the electoral results to the Amazonas, Aragua and Yaracuy states, six of which were rejected and one was admitted, suspending the results of the Amazonas state circuits.

The Electoral Chamber of the Supreme Tribunal ordered the Assembly to disincorporate the deputies from Amazonas, but the Assembly, presided by Henry Ramos Allup, disobeyed responding that the deputies already had parliamentary immunity; The Attorney General, Luisa Ortega Díaz, later assured that the National Assembly was not in contempt, since contempt could only be applied to individuals and not institutions.

After this, deputy Héctor Rodríguez, from the Great Patriotic Pole coalition, introduced an appeal to the TSJ on 7 January 2016 to declare null all of the acts of the National Assembly. On 11 January, the Tribunal accepted the appeal and ruled in favor of it, declaring without effect all of the acts of the National Assembly &quot;while it stayed in contempt&quot;

With each action of the National Assembly now in hands of the opposition, the ruling party introduced appeals to annul such actions, and through numerous sentences the Tribunal started limiting the Assembly actions established in the constitution, while at the same time it exercised actions constitutionally exclusive to the parliament with the justification of &quot;legislative omission&quot; due to the &quot;contempt&quot; of the Assembly.

Starting 2017, in an ordinary plenary session, the National Assembly, then presided over by Julio Borges, officially disincorporated the three contested deputies, complying with the condition of the Supreme Tribunal to end the &quot;contempt&quot;. However, the Supreme Tribunal did not withdraw the contempt arguing that the previous directive, presided by Ramos Allup, was the one that should have done the procedure.
=== 2017 constitutional crisis ===
==== Rulings 155 and 156 ====
On 27 March 2017, in sentence 155, the Tribunal granted faculties of the National Assembly to Nicolás Maduro to legislate and &quot;take the civilian, military, economic, criminal, administrative, political, juridic and social measures considered necessary to prevent a state of conmotion...&quot;. On 29 March, the Tribunal published a second sentence, 156, attributed to itself the constitutional functions of the Assembly and decided on delegating them on the organisms that is considered pertinent, on the pretext of &quot;legislative omission&quot; of the Assembly. The sentence was met with both domestic and international alarm from different personalities and institutions, some of which defined sentence 156 as a self-coup d&#x27;état. This included Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz, who during a press conferenced in the seat of the Public Ministry defined both sentences as a &quot;rupture of the constitutional order&quot;.

Maduro qualified the Attorney&#x27;s declarations as a &quot;impasse&quot; between the Public Ministry and the Tribunal, as the reason why the same day he convened a Nation Defense Council to discuss the review of sentences 155 and 156. The following day, the Tribunal published clarifications on the sentences where the measures that transferred the parliament competences to the Tribunal and Maduro were partially suppressed. Jurists defined the clarifications as illegal, since the Constitutional Chamber cannot make a review of the sentences for being &quot;res judicata&quot; (claim preclusion).

On 1 May 2017, Maduro convenes a Constituent National Assembly based on a disputed interpretation of Articles 347, 348 and 349 of the constitution. Such call was met with preoccupation again, and many jurists argued that Maduro violated the constitution by assuming functions of the citizens to summon a Constituent Assembly. 

On 17 May, the Tribunal decided on five nullity complaints from 2010 against the Reform of the Organic Law of Municipal Public Power, which replaced the Parochial Meetings with Communal Parochial Meetings. The Tribunal decided that communal councils could elect the members of the Parochial Meetings, implementing an indirect suffrage. The sentence has been qualified as a grave violation of the direct, universal and secret vote of Article 63 of the Constitution.

On 7 June 2017, the Constitutional Chamber issued sentence 378, where the Tribunal decided that the president is empowered to summon a Constituent Assembly without a previous consultative referendum. Once again the sentence was criticized for being considered violatory of the constitutional principles, specially sovereignty, since Article 5 of the constitution states that it &quot;resides intransferibly in the people&quot;.

==== Helicopter attack====

Venezuela&#x27;s protesters set fire to the executive directorate of the judiciary of the Supreme Court in the Chacao municipality on 12 June 2017. Violence broke out in protests at the Supreme Court over a bid to change the Constitution. On 27 June 2017, a helicopter attacked the TSJ building with gunfire and grenades.

==== Attorney General response ====
On 8 June, the Attorney General introduced an electoral contentious appeal in the Electoral Chamber Constituent Assembly, and invoking Article 333 of the constitution she invited the Venezuelans to adhere to the appeal with the purpose of stopping the Constituent Assembly and preserve the validity of the current constitution. The following day the surroundings of the Tribunals were blocked by security forces, impeding citizens from adhering to the appeal. On 12 June, the Tribunal declared inadmissible the appeal due to &quot;inept pretensions accumulation&quot;.

In response to the rejection of the Tribunal, the Luisa Ortega challenged the appointment of the 13 main justices and 21 alternates for considering a lack of suitability and bias in their actions, as well as aggravating the crisis in the country. She also requested the challenged justices to refraining to learn about the cause of the challenge, in accordance of Articles 55, 56 and 57 of the Supreme Tribunal Organic Law. The Attorney General explained that during the appointment procedure of the justices, the Moral Council did not convene an extraordinary sessions to evaluate the candidacy conditions in compliance of Article 74 of the Supreme Tribunal Law, but rather the candidates expedients were submitted and later she was handed the act to be signed, which she refused to do for not convening the session. On the following day, Ombudsman Tarek William Saab published a document with the alleged signature of Luisa Ortega, arguing that she did sign the act. Afterwards, María José Marcano, former secretary of the Moral Council, accused William Saab of lying and presenting a forged document, since neither Luisa Ortega or she had signed the act, finding it being done illegally with political pressures.

On 14 June, the Tribunal once again dismissed the appeal, warning that:
El 13 de junio la Fiscal solicitó al TSJ antejuicio de mérito contra 6 magistrados principales y 2 suplentes por conspiración para atentar contra la forma republicana de la nación, delito tipificado en el artículo 132 del Código Penal, al mismo tiempo que solicitó a los magistrados acusados inhibirse de conocer de la causa de conformidad con los artículos 55, 56 y 57 de la LOTSJ.

===2017 appointment and Supreme Tribunal of Justice in exile===

The discontent with the Bolivarian government saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly of Venezuela for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 Parliamentary Election. As a result of that election, the lame duck National Assembly consisting of Bolivarian officials filled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice with their allies.

Following months of unrest surrounding the recall referendum against President Maduro in 2016, on 29 March 2017 the Bolivarian Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that the National Assembly was &quot;in a situation of contempt&quot;, because of the aforementioned rulings against the election of some of its members. It stripped the Assembly of legislative powers, and took those powers for itself; which meant that the Court would have been able to create laws. The court did not indicate if or when it might hand power back. As a result of the ruling, the 2017 Venezuelan protests began surrounding the constitutional crisis, with the Bolivarian Supreme Tribunal of Justice reversing its ruling on 1 April 2017.

After being stripped of power during the constitutional crisis and the call for a rewriting of the constitution by the Bolivarian government, opposition-led National Assembly of Venezuela created a Judicial Nominations Committee on 13 June 2017 to elect new members of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. On 12 July 2017, Ombudsman Tarek Saab, head of the Moral Council of Venezuela, said that the call for new magistrates would not be officially recognized by the Bolivarian government and that the magistrates already appointed by the lame duck Bolivarian National Assembly would instead continue to be recognized. Despite the rejection of recognition by the Bolivarian government, the opposition-led National Assembly then voted 33 magistrates into office on 21 July 2017, separate from the Bolivarian government, forming the Supreme Tribunal of Justice in exile.

=== 2018 opposition parties prohibition in presidential election ===

On 23 January 2018, the Constituent National Assembly ordered the presidential elections should be scheduled in 2018 and before 30 April. Several Venezuelan NGOs, such as Foro Penal Venezolano, Súmate, Voto Joven, the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Citizen Electoral Network, expressed their concern over the irregularities of the electoral schedule, including the lack of the Constituent Assembly&#x27;s competencies to summon the elections, impeding participation of opposition political parties, and the lack of time for standard electoral functions. Because of this, the European Union, the Organization of American States and countries including Australia and the United States rejected the electoral process.

Two days later, on 25 January, the high court ordered the Electoral Council to exclude from the elections the Democratic Unity Roundtable, the most voted coalition in Venezuela&#x27;s democratic history, arguing that in the coalition there were political parties that did not meet validation requirements.

=== 2018 Christmas party ===
In December 2018, videos and pictures were leaked showing a glamorous Christmas party that counted with an expensive feast, including French wine, taking place in the Supreme Tribunal seat. The images received considerable backlash from social networks, criticizing the costs of the party during the grave economic crisis in the country and the hypocrisy of the socialist regime.

=== Christian Zerpa defection ===
On 8 January 2019, Electoral Chamber justice Christian Zerpa defected and escaped to the United States, dissenting with the inauguration of Nicolás Maduro as president for a second period. From Orlando, Florida, Zerpa made a series of declarations that questioned the independence of powers and the transparency of the judiciary system in Venezuela. In an interview, Zerpa denounced that Cilia Flores handles the Venezuelan judiciary branch arbitrarily and that in 2015 he received a call from Flores telling him that he would be appointed as justice. He confessed that he was appointed as justice of the Supreme Tribunal in 2015 for always have been loyal to chavismo.

Among the declarations given, he affirmed that many of the court&#x27;s decisions responded to orders from the ruling party, and stressed that Maikel Moreno, the current chief justice of the Supreme Tribunal, and Raúl Gorrín, president of the television channel Globovisión, are involved in corruption schemes.

==Chambers==
The Supreme Tribunal is divided in six chambers or instances that divide the work depending on its competences, which are the following:

* Constitucional Chamber
* Politic-Administrative Chamber
* Electoral Chamber
* Civil Cassation Chamber
* Social Cassation Chamber
* Criminal Cassation Chamber

All of the chambers are part of the Plenary Chamber.

=== Constitutional Chamber ===

=== Politic-Administrative Chamber ===

=== Electoral Chamber ===

=== Civil Cassation Chamber ===

=== Social Cassation Chamber ===

=== Criminal Cassation Chamber ===

==Criticisms==
Venezuela&#x27;s judicial system has been deemed the most corrupt in the world by Transparency International in 2014. Human Rights Watch claimed that in 2004, President Hugo Chávez and his allies took over the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, filling it with his supporters and adding measures so the government could dismiss justices from the court. In 2010, legislators from Chávez&#x27;s political party appointed nine permanent judges and 32 stand-ins, which included several allies. They claimed that some judges may face reprisals if they rule against government interests.

It has also been alleged that the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, with the majority supporting Chávez, elected officials to the supposedly non-partisan National Electoral Council of Venezuela, despite the 1999 Constitution empowering the National Assembly of Venezuela to perform that action. This resulted in Chavistas making up a majority of the electoral council&#x27;s board.

After Chávez&#x27; death and with Nicolás Maduro as president, following the 2015 National Assembly election, the lame duck National Assembly, the majority of whom were Bolivarian supporters, filled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice with Maduro allies. The tribunal then quickly stripped three new opposition lawmakers of their National Assembly seats in early 2016, citing irregularities in their elections, thereby preventing an opposition supermajority which would have been able to challenge Maduro. The tribunal then approved several actions by Maduro and granted him more powers.

In 2024, BBC and El País described the court as partisan and controlled by the PSUV government of Nicolás Maduro.

<text>Michael Gwynne Dyer (born 17 April 1943) is a British-Canadian military historian, author, professor, journalist, broadcaster, and retired naval officer. Dyer rose to prominence in the 1980s with the release of his television series &quot;War&quot; in 1983 and the publication of an accompanying book in 1985. Since the 1960s he has lived in London, England, where he works as a syndicated columnist. Dyer is a noted expert in Middle Eastern affairs, having completed his graduate work in this area and written several books on the subject. More recently he has focused on climate change and its geopolitical consequences.

==Biography==
Dyer was born during World War II in St. John&#x27;s to an Irish Catholic family. At the time of his birth, the province was the Dominion of Newfoundland, then under direct rule by a commission from London. When Newfoundland joined Canada on 31 March 1949 he became &quot;de jure&quot; a Canadian citizen. Dyer joined the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve at the age of sixteen. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts in history from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1963, a Master of Arts in military history from Rice University in Houston, Texas, in 1966 and a Doctor of Philosophy in military and Middle Eastern history at King&#x27;s College London in 1973. Dyer served in the Canadian, American and British naval reserves. He was employed as a senior lecturer in war studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, 1973–77. In 1973 he began writing articles for leading London newspapers on the Arab–Israeli conflict, and soon decided to abandon academic life for a full-time career in journalism. Dyer was the O.D. Skelton Memorial lecturer on March 23, 1998, in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. In the fall of 2002 Royal Roads University awarded Dyer an Honorary Degree. In 2010, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Dyer lives in Camden Town, London with his second wife Tina Viljoen. The couple met during the production of his 1983 television series &quot;War&quot;, where Viljoen was a co-producer. They have one daughter. Dyer also has two sons from his first marriage to journalist Clare Dyer.

<doc id="847644" wikidata="Q2715089" url="?curid=847644" title="Joyce Summers">
<text>Joyce Summers is a fictional character in the action-horror television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). Played by Kristine Sutherland, Joyce is the mother of the main character, Buffy Summers, and appears in 58 of the 144 episodes.

The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter&#x27;s powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy&#x27;s small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy&#x27;s dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter&#x27;s abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.

==Creation and casting==
The television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (often simplified as &quot;Buffy&quot;) was created by Joss Whedon, who originally used the concept of a teenage girl who is given superhuman powers to fight evil, in a screenplay that became a film in 1992. Unhappy with the outcome of the film, Whedon created the series, which picks up shortly after the events of the film and is loosely based on its ending. At the end of the film, which was set in Los Angeles, Buffy fights and defeats a gang of vampires in her school&#x27;s gymnasium. At the start of the television series Buffy and her mother Joyce, who has divorced Buffy&#x27;s father, move to a new town named Sunnydale where Buffy is to attend Sunnydale High School, which, unknown to her, is situated on a portal to hell, called a Hellmouth. The series explains that she has relocated from Los Angeles after burning down the gymnasium, marking her as a trouble-making student and a worrisome daughter. The series regularly employs the elements of dark fantasy and horror to represent the real problems regularly encountered by adolescents, with many situations also reflecting adult fears and anxieties.

Buffy&#x27;s parents are barely seen in the film, but her mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) plays a prominent role in the series. Sutherland, a fantasy fiction fan who dislikes the horror genre, had recently moved to Hollywood from New York City in 1996 and was not actively looking for acting jobs when her agent called her with the opportunity to play Joyce. Sutherland auditioned the same day as David Boreanaz, Buffy&#x27;s romantic interest Angel, and was impressed with how naturally she felt at ease with the material in the readings with the writers and casting agents. Sutherland said in an interview that she felt she identified strongly with adolescents. Her empathy for them made her protective not only of the actors, but of their characters as well. A storyline with the premise that Joyce be possessed as the mother from hell was one of Sutherland&#x27;s favorite possible scripts, but it was cut.

==Progression==

===Seasons 1 and 2===
Buffy is introduced to her new school as a student who is both emotionally and academically troubled. With the move to Sunnydale, she believes she is starting fresh, a notion her mother also believes and encourages. As Buffy establishes herself in school in early episodes, Joyce, who is recently divorced, is preoccupied with setting up their home and running an art gallery. Initially unwilling to become involved again with her role as the Slayer, Buffy is nevertheless confronted by the school librarian Giles (Anthony Head), her new Watcher, the mentor and teacher assigned to instruct her how to fight vampires and other demons she is destined to face. Buffy does not tell her mother about this development, and Joyce remains ignorant of Buffy&#x27;s role as the Slayer and of Giles&#x27; influence in her life, something she later resents when he seems to be closer to Buffy in ways Joyce is not.

Joyce&#x27;s initial role in the series is, according to scholar J. P. Williams, very similar to the Superman character Lois Lane, who is unable to discern the likeness between Clark Kent with his glasses on and Superman with his glasses off. Buffy is frequently referred to as a superhero by authors, and Joyce&#x27;s initial ignorance of Buffy&#x27;s abilities and responsibilities creates skepticism among both characters in the series and viewers about Joyce&#x27;s intelligence and motivations. For example, Joyce sees the extremely attentive Giles merely as a teacher concerned about Buffy as a student who has experienced academic problems in the past.

This willful ignorance of Buffy&#x27;s vocation has been well-analyzed by Buffy studies scholars. A persistent theme in &quot;Buffy&quot; is the nearly unbreachable generation gap between adolescents and adults. Throughout the series, adults are either unable or unwilling to see the genuine horrors teenagers face. As Buffy&#x27;s mother, Joyce is repeatedly confronted with evidence of her daughter&#x27;s role as the Slayer; Sutherland saw this as a form of denial on Joyce&#x27;s part. The resulting conflict between Joyce and Buffy is both tragic and humorous. When Buffy skips class or stays out late to attend to her Slayer duties, Joyce is left trying to punish her by restricting her to the house. Joyce responds to the dire situations Buffy must face by placing regular and inconvenient restrictions on her, such as grounding her at a time when Buffy must confront and try to kill the Master (the head of a vampire cult who is attempting to fulfill a prophecy that he will kill the Slayer and open the Hellmouth in Sunnydale), saying sarcastically to Buffy, &quot;I know—if you don&#x27;t go out it&#x27;ll be the end of the world&quot;, when in fact, it just may be, or telling Buffy that she is free to make her own life choices, when Buffy knows exactly what her destiny is, and that it may include dying young. This duality of language reinforces the generation gap between the characters.

Joyce is, according to author Lorna Jowett, a typical &quot;teen-horror parent&quot;: loving and supporting, but not really facing or knowing the true extent of reality, therefore ineffective at helping her child. She embodies the expectation that mothers should intuitively understand their children. Buffy confronts her mother&#x27;s denial in &quot;Becoming&quot;, the second-season finale, forcing Joyce to see the reality of what Buffy is and does. As a result of their confrontation, Joyce gives Buffy an ultimatum that she either stay at home or never come back. As Buffy is compelled to thwart the apocalypse, she accepts her mother&#x27;s decision, leaves the house and, ultimately, Sunnydale. Sutherland read the script for the second-season finale in her car, unable to stop reading until the resolution, where she sat sobbing when it is revealed Buffy leaves. In their heated encounter Buffy says to her mother, &quot;Open your eyes, Mom. What do you think has been going on for the past two years? The fights? The weird occurrences. How many times have you washed blood out of my clothing and you still haven&#x27;t figured it out?&quot; Joyce responds by trying to restrict Buffy again, then attempting to physically restrain her, at which point Buffy ends Joyce&#x27;s ideas of parental authority by easily overpowering her and walking out the door.

Despite her difficulty with understanding Buffy, Joyce frequently expresses her love for her daughter and supports her when other adults do not. The love Joyce expresses is interpreted by scholars as an attempt to compensate for having failed to understand intuitively that something was going on with her daughter before the revelation that Buffy is the Slayer. Following that revelation, Joyce makes many attempts to understand what a Slayer does. Many scenes showing Joyce giving love and support to Buffy take place in their home, establishing it as center of motherly devotion, stability, and safety. Shots are usually composed so that the two are not seen in the same frame, or are separated by objects such as tables, or placed in opposite sides of rooms, a visual representation of Joyce&#x27;s inability to understand her daughter&#x27;s responsibilities and powers.

===Seasons 3 and 4===
The third season opens with Buffy returning home from Los Angeles at the end of &quot;Anne&quot;. Joyce and Buffy are at first very ill at ease with each other during the next episode, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;, while Buffy starts to understand how difficult Joyce&#x27;s time has been without her. Sutherland welcomed the change; she felt the relationship between Joyce and Buffy &quot;became so much richer&quot; after Joyce finally knew of and faced Buffy&#x27;s role as the Slayer. The overt conflict of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; has Joyce bringing home a cursed mask that calls zombies to the house while a party is occurring, killing several people. Author Nikki Stafford sees the zombies at the party as symbolism for the utter confusion of dealing with Buffy&#x27;s return. During the party, Buffy feels so uncomfortable around her family and friends she considers leaving again. Joyce and Buffy&#x27;s best friend Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) both angrily confront Buffy; Joyce admits that she does not know all the answers and that giving Buffy an ultimatum was a mistake. The episode marks Joyce&#x27;s return as a parent; her recognition of her own shortcomings in the error of pushing Buffy away is a measure of nobility common among Joss Whedon&#x27;s characters.

Following her realization that Buffy is the Slayer, Joyce begins to express concern for Buffy&#x27;s well-being and long-term plans. The third season showcases two episodes in which Joyce is a major character. Both of them posit Buffy as a parent figure over Joyce. With &quot;Band Candy&quot; the episode begins with Buffy being petulant and Joyce working with Giles to create a schedule for studying and slaying, but these roles quickly dissolve in the ensuing chaos. In an attempt to offer a sacrifice to a demon, Sunnydale&#x27;s shadowy mayor intoxicates the adults of the town with drugged chocolate bars, making them devolve into adolescents. Joyce descends into the behavior of a 16-year-old, a prospect Kristine Sutherland found not only fun, but painful as it brought back memories she had not faced in years. Giles is also affected, turning into his adolescent miscreant self, which Joyce finds irresistible (the two have sex on a police car in the middle of downtown Sunnydale). Giles has become Buffy&#x27;s father figure following her parents&#x27; divorce, and Buffy finds Joyce&#x27;s attraction to Giles disquieting. Joyce had dated before (&quot;Ted&quot;) but Buffy, and consequently the audience, do not see Joyce as a sexual character; she is foremost a mother. According to Lorna Jowett, Joyce is rare among the characters on the series: &quot;Joyce is always and only Buffy&#x27;s mother, never just another person or a member of the team.&quot;

The second instance of role-reversal is in the episode &quot;Gingerbread&quot;, where again children demonstrate more wisdom than the adults. The episode is noted as highlighting this motif specifically, as the divide between parents and children is exaggerated and symbolized by Joyce&#x27;s confusion. In an attempt to learn more about her daughter&#x27;s Slayer duties, Joyce follows Buffy on patrol at night, bringing snacks and saying she wants to observe Buffy work. Joyce finds two dead children in a playground and is deeply disturbed. After Buffy comforts her mother, the Scoobies discover that the children are the manifestation of a demon whose sole purpose is to tear communities apart by sparking moral panics. Joyce, meanwhile, becomes entirely consumed with finding the culprit of the apparent murders. She starts a parents&#x27; activist organization named &quot;Mothers Opposed to the Occult&quot; (or &quot;M.O.O.&quot; to Buffy&#x27;s mortification) with Willow&#x27;s mother, an academic and parenting expert so self-involved that she virtually ignores her daughter. Both Buffy and Willow—whose skills in witchcraft are growing—are seized by M.O.O., who attempt to burn them at the stake. Joyce takes a leadership role, giving a speech to concerned parents about the unnatural evils in the town, citing the &quot;slayers and witches&quot; among other monsters. Her compulsion to become involved in Buffy&#x27;s dark world, with its disastrous results, represents her feeling of helplessness in relation to Buffy&#x27;s calling. She is unable to protect or comprehend what Buffy must endure—another expression of teenage-parent alienation.

In the fourth season, as Buffy and Willow attend college, Joyce&#x27;s role is scaled back considerably. Kristine Sutherland and her family moved to Italy to live, so she starred in only five episodes in the season, including the first one, &quot;The Freshman,&quot; when Buffy comes home during her bewildering first week at college to discover that Joyce has filled her room with packing crates from the art gallery. This sign of her mother&#x27;s life going on without her increases Buffy&#x27;s disorientation and underscores Joyce&#x27;s independent life. Consequent to her mother&#x27;s distance, Buffy must begin to face some of her problems alone, the least of which is cooking Thanksgiving dinner for Giles and the Scooby Gang in &quot;Pangs&quot;. Buffy encounters a female psychology professor at college who challenges and frustrates her, but also validates her intellect, something Buffy has not been well known for. Professor Maggie Walsh becomes, for the first part of the season, a substitute mother for Buffy. The last episode of the season,&quot;Restless&quot;, explores the dreams of Willow, Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), Giles, and Buffy. Joyce appears as a seductress to Xander (in a red silk nightgown), and appears again in Buffy&#x27;s dream as Buffy wanders the halls of college. Joyce is stuck inside a wall, saying that she is content making lemonade and learning to play mahjong. The enigmatic nature of &quot;Restless&quot; allows analysts to explain the depth of the characters and their relationships, as well as the foreshadowing of events to come in subsequent seasons. Joyce&#x27;s confinement in a tight space in Buffy&#x27;s dream indicates that Buffy considers her mother&#x27;s life to be very limited. The hole in the wall through which Joyce and Buffy speak briefly shows only Joyce&#x27;s head and shoulders, which, according to Nikki Stafford, is the prevailing image in the fifth-season episode &quot;The Body&quot;, an episode which explores Joyce&#x27;s death and its immediate aftermath.

===Season 5: Joyce&#x27;s death===
As noted by author Roz Kaveney, Joyce becomes central to the fifth season themes of family and Buffy facing forces she is unable to fight or control. A new character is introduced to the Summers family: Buffy gets a 14-year-old sister named Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), who is the mystical embodiment of a &quot;key&quot; which opens portals to all dimensions. Prior to Dawn&#x27;s arrival, Joyce has been experiencing loneliness as Buffy&#x27;s increasing responsibilities takes over, at one point remarking that her house gets very quiet without Buffy present. She inadvertently invites the Romanian vampire mystic Count Dracula as the result. Although Dawn is unaware of what she is, Buffy discovers her true identity after becoming suspicious that Dawn is attempting to harm Joyce. After experiencing debilitating headaches, collapsing, then requiring hospitalization, Joyce learns that she has a brain tumor. A side-effect of the tumor is that Joyce remembers that she had never gave birth to Dawn and glimpses her as a bright, beautiful, mystical energy. Buffy later admits the truth and tells Joyce of why Dawn is in their lives and that she is protecting her from a powerful hell-god Glory (Clare Kramer). 

Despite of knowing Dawn&#x27;s true origins, Joyce still loves her, accepting Dawn as her daughter, and collaborates with Buffy and Giles to protect her. Buffy believes that Dawn was based on her and they later discover that they share blood, revealing that Dawn truly is Joyce&#x27;s daughter genetically. 

To protect Dawn as well as tend to Joyce after she has brain surgery, Buffy moves out of her dorm and returns to the family home. Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), Buffy&#x27;s boyfriend for the past year, leaves in the episode &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. Following his departure, and in the course of the episode &quot;I Was Made to Love You&quot;, Buffy comes to feel that she does not need a boyfriend. Her confidence in this decision is immediately shaken at the end of the episode when she comes home to find her mother&#x27;s lifeless body on the sofa. Joyce&#x27;s death is fully explored in &quot;The Body&quot; as the entire cast of characters struggles to understand how the once-vibrant Joyce has become a body in the morgue. Scholar Jes Battis writes that in contrast to the way family members are portrayed throughout the series as absent (Willow&#x27;s), chaotic (Xander&#x27;s), or highly disruptive (Anya&#x27;s), Joyce straddles these extremes. The ease of her success at mothering a violent superhero and a mystical key while appearing to enjoy a normal life is eroded by a brain tumor, and only then do she and the other characters come to understand what a complex job she has. To scholars the tumor represents the physical manifestation of not being able to take care of Buffy, or a form of mortality that Buffy will not soon face.

To Joss Whedon, the tumor represented nothing more than cancer. He planned to kill Joyce as early as the third season, and he wrote the episode to reflect what he experienced when he lost his own mother to a brain aneurysm. In 2001, Whedon told an interviewer, &quot;I knew I was going to kill Joyce, and I knew that what I wanted to capture — because I had lost my own mother — was that weird dumb grief and the various reactions that people have to death.&quot; &quot;The Body&quot; begins with a Christmas dinner scene presided over by Joyce as the head of her chosen family. At the table are Buffy, Dawn, Giles, Willow, her girlfriend Tara (Amber Benson), Xander, and his ex-demon girlfriend Anya (Emma Caulfield). Pragmatically, the scene was included so the credits would not roll over the dramatic moments of Buffy finding her dead mother and trying to revive her. Whedon did not want to include any element that broke the illusion presented in the episode. In a realm where the main adolescent characters, who are becoming adults, must regularly face horrors and evils, Joyce represents a stable and predictable life. Her death crushes the illusion that real or normal life — which Buffy frequently says she wants but cannot have — is trouble-free. Joyce is mourned by all of the characters in the series. Even the amoral vampire Spike (James Marsters) expresses his condolences. In an earlier episode he had confided in a very sympathetic Joyce about his equally amoral and insane lover Drusilla (Juliet Landau) leaving him. Likewise, Anya, who has very little experience with human emotions and frailties, is confused and unexpectedly saddened by Joyce&#x27;s death.

==Other appearances==
Joyce appears in four episodes after her death in &quot;The Body&quot;, first as a young woman in season 5&#x27;s &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;: Buffy has a recurring but false memory of her parents bringing Dawn home as a newborn. The episode deals with Buffy&#x27;s inability to cope with her mother&#x27;s death and her inadequacy at protecting Dawn, and explores Buffy&#x27;s obsession with her failure and guilt. The sixth-season episode &quot;Normal Again&quot; posits Buffy&#x27;s world of Sunnydale as a manifestation of psychopathology: after being stabbed by a demon, Buffy becomes convinced that the world in which she is a hero is an illusion. Her parents, who have remained happily married, visit her in a mental institution and encourage her to fight the seductive world she has imagined and return home with them. Joyce appears twice in the seventh season: she haunts Dawn as a face of the First Evil in &quot;Conversations with Dead People&quot;, and makes her final appearance again as an incarnation of the First Evil in Buffy&#x27;s dream in &quot;Bring on the Night&quot;.

==Influence==
Throughout the series, Buffy frequently expresses anxiety about being wanted and accepted. One of the most overt expressions of her concern is in the first-season episode &quot;Nightmares&quot;, where characters&#x27; nightmares come true. In Buffy&#x27;s nightmare, her father cruelly tells her he no longer wants to spend any time with her because of her defects as a daughter. She further worries that her ostensible troubled behavior at school and disobedience at home may have been a significant reason for the ending of her parents&#x27; marriage. She pushes away her friends and family to protect them from what she must face, while simultaneously depending on their assistance. Psychologists writing about Buffy state that she is a candidate for an anxiety disorder, as most often people diagnosed with anxiety disorders worry and fixate on problems, behaviors which studies suggest are inherited. In this light, they analyze Joyce&#x27;s actions as overprotective of Buffy in early seasons: her vigilance causes Buffy to need to sneak in and out of the house through her bedroom window. Joyce is also continually encouraging her to avoid badly-behaved classmates. Regardless of this, Joyce&#x27;s nurturing of Buffy is cited as being one of the reasons Buffy has been able to live as long as she has — much longer than other Slayers, who historically have usually died very young — and is a source of Buffy&#x27;s strength. Joyce and Giles often work in similar ways to guide Buffy morally and emotionally. Buffy&#x27;s tragic love affair with Angel, a relationship that could bring neither of them any happiness, was broken off, in part, after Joyce&#x27;s request that Angel be the one to end it.

According to Lorna Jowett, Joyce is a vehicle through which older viewers can judge the actions of the younger characters. Jowett sees Joyce as a &quot;post-feminist matriarch&quot;: she is the head of a household that rarely requires the presence of men. Buffy, according to Jowett, descends from two female lines: the Slayer line and the Summers line. In opposition to Buffy, Joyce never expresses that she has been abandoned by men, and she retains feminine characteristics: she runs an art gallery, has other friends, and dates. Jes Battis argues that Joyce&#x27;s role as Buffy&#x27;s mother goes mostly unnoticed because of societal expectations audiences are expected to make about single mothers — at least until her death. Buffy&#x27;s grief must coincide with Buffy becoming who Joyce was. In this process, Buffy struggles to fill Joyce&#x27;s role, finding it more difficult than being a Slayer.

<text>Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport is a city-owned, public-use airport serving Kansas City, Missouri, United States. Located in Clay County, this facility is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, which categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport.

==History==

This airport replaced the old Richards Field, located near Raytown, Missouri, as Kansas City&#x27;s main airport. It was dedicated as &quot;New Richards Field&quot; in 1927 by Charles Lindbergh and was soon renamed Kansas City Municipal Airport. Its prominent tenant was Trans World Airlines (TWA), which was headquartered in Kansas City. The airport was built in the Missouri River bottoms next to the rail tracks at the Hannibal Bridge. At the time, air travel was considered to be handled in conjunction with rail traffic.

The airport had limited area for expansion (Fairfax Airport across the Missouri River in Kansas City, Kansas, covered a larger area). Airplanes had to avoid the Quality Hill and the Downtown Kansas City skyline south of the south end of the main runway. In the early 1960s, an FAA memo called it &quot;the most dangerous major airport in the country&quot; and urged that no further federal funds be spent on it. A new airport was then constructed to serve Kansas City, being the Kansas City International Airport (MCI) which was opened in 1972 with all scheduled passenger airline flights being moved from MKC to MCI at that time.

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (OAG) listed the following weekday departures from MKC: 
* Braniff International Airways - 40 
* Trans World Airlines (TWA) - 39
* Continental Airlines - 9
* United Airlines - 4
* Delta Air Lines - 2
* Ozark Airlines - 2
* Central Airlines - 2

The downtown airport has been renamed for Charles Wheeler who was mayor when Kansas City International opened. Richards Road, which serves the airport, is named for John Francisco Richards II, a Kansas City airman killed in World War I (and whose name was also applied to Richards Field and Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base).

Today the airport is used for corporate and recreational aviation. The terminal building today houses VML, a global advertising and marketing agency headquartered in Kansas City. Its location near downtown has excellent highway access.

It is home to the National Airline History Museum. Though this museum primarily contains artifacts from TWA (due to the fact that most of its volunteers are local retired TWA employees), it is dedicated to airline history in general. A second museum, The TWA Museum, is housed in the original terminal that it was founded in at 10 Richards Road and is dedicated to the history of TWA. The airport also hosts the Aviation Expo (Air Show), most years, usually in August.

==Facilities and aircraft==

The airport covers 700 acres (283 ha) at an elevation of 757 feet (231 m). It has two runways. Runway 1/19 is 6,827 by 150 feet (2,081 x 46 m) concrete with an EMAS at both ends. Runway 3/21 is 5,050 by 100 feet (1,539 x 30 m) asphalt.

Construction on runway 1-19 is complete and both runways are in use to their full length.

Taxiway H was at one time part of runway 17/35, which was closed after an FAA decision on the required separation between terminal buildings and the runway.

The airport is on the north side of the confluence of the Kansas River and Missouri River. Levees protected the airport relatively well during the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993 although there was standing water. The 1951 flood devastated the Fairfax airport and caused Kansas City to build what would become Kansas City International Airport away from the river to keep the TWA overhaul base in the area after it had been destroyed in the flood at Fairfax.

On October 17, 2006, the Kansas City, Missouri, Aviation Department announced plans to build a $20 million aircraft hangar complex at the Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport including: 122 T-hangars, 13 box hangars, a terminal building with offices, a pilots&#x27; lounge, meeting rooms and a destination restaurant.

In the year ending September 30, 2022, the airport had 114,975 aircraft operations, average 315 per day: 77% general aviation, 21% air taxi, 2.2% military, and &lt;1% commercial. 176 aircraft were then based at the airport: 76 single-engine and 23 multi-engine airplanes, 66 jet airplanes, and 11 helicopters.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On November 4, 1942, a Trans World Airlines Douglas DC-3 taking off from MKC collided with a USAAF Douglas C-53 preparing to land at the airport collided at 3,000 feet. Despite the collision, both damaged aircraft made it to the ground and all survived.
* On July 12, 1955, a Trans World Airlines Douglas DC-3 on a training flight collided with a Cessna 140 on approach to a touch-and-go at nearby Fairfax Municipal Airport, now defunct. The Cessna crashed and killed both occupants but the DC-3 landed safely at Fairfax Airport. The DC-3 was substantially damaged but later repaired and placed back into service.
* On May 22, 1962, Continental Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 707 en route from Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport to Kansas City Downtown Airport exploded over Unionville, Missouri. All 45 on board were killed.
* On January 29, 1963, Continental Airlines Flight 290, a Vickers Viscount, crashed on approach at the end of runway 18 because of accretion of ice on the horizontal stabilizer causing a loss of pitch control. All 3 crew and 5 passengers were killed.
* July 1, 1965, Continental Airlines Flight 12, a Boeing 707-124 registered as N70773, suffered a runway excursion during landing at the airport due to hydroplaning. No one out of the 66 occupants onboard lost their lives, however, five were injured.
* On September 13, 1965, a Trans World Airlines Convair CV-880 on a training flight reached a maximum speed of 146 knots after lift-off, began to decay, then began buffeting with the nose and a right 25 degree bank, then impacted the ground. All 4 occupants survived, but the aircraft was destroyed and written off.
* On January 9, 1985, a Lockheed L-188 Electra operated by &quot;TPI International Airways&quot; , a cargo flight, crashed after missing a missed approach at MKC. The aircraft climbed to 3,100 feet, then stalled and crashed into a public water treatment plant 5km NW of Wheeler Airport. All 3 occupants were killed.
* On January 28, 2005, a Learjet 35 operated by Million Air was damaged substantially during a landing overrun at MKC at night with a runway contaminated by snow. Both occupants survived but the aircraft was written off. 
* On August 20, 2011, pilot Bryan Jensen was killed when his Vertical Unlimited 12 (a modified Pitts 12) crashed during the Kansas City Air Expo.
* On August 5, 2013, a construction contractor working on a taxiway near runway 1 discovered human remains buried in the ground.

<doc id="847649" wikidata="Q1045848" url="?curid=847649" title="Lancer">
<text>A lancer was a type of cavalryman who fought with a lance. Lances were used for mounted warfare in Assyria as early as and subsequently by India, Egypt, China, Persia, Greece, and Rome. The weapon was widely used throughout Eurasia during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance by heavy cavalry, but fell out of general use by the late 16th century, before its revival by light cavalry in the early 19th century.

==17th-, 18th-, and 19th-century lancers==

The lancer (Polish: &quot;ułan&quot;, German: &quot;Ulan&quot;, French: &quot;uhlan&quot;) had become a common sight in the majority of European, Ottoman, and Indian cavalry forces during this time, but, with the exception of the Ottoman troops, they increasingly discarded the heavy armour to give greater freedom of movement in combat. The Polish &quot;winged&quot; lancers were amongst the last European units to abandon their armour. There was debate over the value of the lance in mounted combat during the 17th and 18th centuries, with most armies having very few lancer units by the beginning of the 19th century.

However, during the Napoleonic Wars, lancers were to be seen in many of the combatant nations as their value in shock tactics became clear. During the wars, the Poles became a ready source of recruitment for several armies, willingly or unwillingly. Polish lancers served with distinction in the Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and French armies, most famously in Napoleon&#x27;s French Imperial Guard as the &quot;1er Regiment de Chevau-Legers-Lanciers de la Garde Impériale&quot;.

At the Battle of Waterloo, French lances were &quot;nearly long, weighed around , and had a steel point on a wooden staff,&quot; according to historian Alessandro Barbero. He adds that they were &quot;terrifyingly efficient.&quot; Commander of the French 1st Corps, 4th Division General Durutte, who saw the battle from the high ground in front of Papelotte, would write later, &quot;I had never before realized the great superiority of the lance over the sword.&quot;

Although having substantial impact in the charge, lancers could be more vulnerable to other cavalry units in close quarters combat, where the lance proved to be a clumsy and easily deflected weapon when employed against sabres in a mêlée. By the late 19th century, many cavalry regiments in Eurasian armies were composed of troopers with lances, as primary weapons, in the front rank and horsemen with sabres only in the second: the lances for the initial shock and sabres for the ensuing mêlée.

==Lancer equipment==

Lancers typically wore a double-breasted jacket (&quot;kurtka&quot;) with a coloured panel at the front (&quot;plastron&quot;), a coloured band of cloth (&quot;sash&quot;), and a square-topped cap (&quot;czapka&quot;). Their lance usually had a small swallow-tailed flag (&quot;pennon&quot;), just below the lance head. The pennons were normally removed or wrapped in a canvas cover during active service . With the improved range and accuracy of infantry muskets and rifles, the high profile presented by lancers with their conspicuous weapons became a problem. Lancers were trained to lower their lances when scouting on hilltops, to help avoid detection by enemy combatants .

==20th-century lancers==

In 1914, lances were still being carried by regiments in the British, Indian, French, Prussian, Italian, Chilean, Portuguese, Japanese, Spanish, Ottoman, Belgian, Argentine, Russian, and Siamese armies, among others. Almost all German cavalry branches (cuirassiers, hussars, dragoons, and uhlans) retained steel tube lances (&quot;stahlrohrlanze&quot;) in length, as their primary weapon. As late as 1914, half of the troopers in each Russian regular cavalry regiment (hussars, uhlans, and dragoons) carried lances on active service, as did all cossacks.

The British cavalry lost the lance for all but ceremonial use in 1903, following the Second Boer War; but a conservative revaluation led to its reintroduction as an active service weapon from 1909 to 1928.

The French army did not have lancer regiments as such, but steel lances in length were carried by the twenty-six dragoon regiments and some light cavalry units in 1914. The French had earlier tested the Indian bamboo lances used by the British cavalry, but had rated them as being too fragile for the shock of encounter. The six Italian &quot;lancieri&quot; regiments still in existence until 1920 carried the 1870 model of ashwood lance, noted for its balance and manageability.

Prior to the outbreak of World War I, there had been controversy as to whether lances or sabres were the more effective &quot;armes blanche&quot; (i.e. mêlée weapons) for cavalry, but neither proved a match for modern firearms and/or artillery. Some armies continued to use lances throughout the war, but they seldom saw use on the Western Front after initial clashes in France and Belgium in 1914. On the Eastern Front, mounted cavalry still had a role and lances saw limited use by the Russian, German, and Austrian armies.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the use of lances ceased for active service in most armies. The German cavalry retained the lance as a service weapon until 1927, as did the British cavalry until 1928. Some other armies retained lance-armed cavalry units for ceremonial purposes only. The Polish cavalry did not discard the lance as a weapon until 1934 or 1937 and continued to use it for training and ceremonial purposes until the outbreak of World War II.

==Current lancer units==
Some modern armored cavalry units are still designated as lancer regiments for historical and ceremonial reasons. There are examples in the armies of Spain (the King&#x27;s Lancers Troop of the Royal Guard&#x27;s Escort Squadron and the Bourbon&#x27;s Lancers Group of the 11th Cavalry Regiment), United Kingdom (Royal Lancers), India (2nd Lancers (Gardner&#x27;s Horse) and 20th Lancers), Belgium (1/3rd Lancers Battalion), Portugal (2nd Lancers Regiment), Pakistan, Italy (5th Lancieri di Novara, 6th Lancieri di Aosta, 8th Lancieri di Montebello), Australia (12th/16th Hunter River Lancers, 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers), Argentina (2nd Tank Cavalry Regiment &quot;General Paz&#x27;s Lancers&quot;), Canada (Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse), Chile (5th Cavalry Regiment &quot;Lancers&quot;), and the United States (National Lancers, Massachusetts Organized Militia)

Although not classified as lancers, the Brazilian Army&#x27;s &quot;Dragões da Independência&quot; (1st Guards Regiment) and the elite soldiers of the Colombian National Army are called Lanceros.

The Portuguese National Republican Guard horse squadrons carry lances on mounted parades, as do many cavalry regiments in South America such as Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru.

The modern Italian Regiment &quot;Lancieri di Montebello&quot; (8th) parade detachments armed with the lances carried as combat weapons until 1920.

<doc id="847651" wikidata="Q6517136" url="?curid=847651" title="Leg bye">
<text>In cricket, a &quot;leg bye&quot; is a type of extra, a run scored by the batting team without the batsman hitting the ball. Law 23 of the Laws of Cricket specifies that one be scored when the ball is not hit with the bat, but it hits the batsman&#x27;s body or protective gear.

==Scoring leg byes==
If the ball deflects off the batter&#x27;s body, the batsmen can attempt to score runs in a similar manner as if the ball had been hit. The number of runs scored are scored as leg byes – they are added to the team&#x27;s total, but not to the number of runs scored by the batter nor to the runs conceded by the bowler. If the ball deflects off the batter&#x27;s body and travels all the way to the boundary, the batting team immediately scores four leg byes, similar to if the ball had been hit to the boundary for a four.

The only part of the batter&#x27;s body to which the rule does not apply is the hand or hands (that is, the batter&#x27;s gloves) holding the bat, which are deemed for the sake of the rules to be a part of the bat. If the ball strikes a hand which for whatever reason is not holding the bat, then leg byes may be scored. However, if the batter deliberately allows the ball to hit a hand which is not holding the bat no leg byes can be scored, and he may on appeal be given out obstructing the field.

Leg byes may only be scored if the ball hits the batter who was:
*attempting to hit the ball with his bat, or
*attempting to evade being hit by the ball.
If the batter was attempting neither of these, and the ball hits his body, it is a dead ball and runs may not be scored. If the batsmen attempt to score runs in this instance, the fielding team may attempt to run either of them out. If the batting pair complete such a &quot;run&quot; when the ball is dead, the umpire signals dead ball, the run is not scored, and the batters must return to their wickets as before the run attempt. 

If it appears that the ball would have hit the stumps were it not for the batter&#x27;s legs, the batter may be dismissed leg before wicket.

Leg byes are the most common form of extras scored in Test cricket. The average number of leg byes scored in a Test match is about 20; in a 50 over game it is about 10. The most leg byes in a single test innings is 35, conceded by England against South Africa in the Proteas&#x27; tour of England, on 1 August 2008.

==Scoring notation==
The conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.

==Validity==
Prior to his retirement from Test cricket Australian captain Steve Waugh called for leg byes to be removed from the sport, commenting: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should get runs when you miss the ball.&quot;

==Umpire&#x27;s signal==
Umpires signal a leg bye with a hand touching their raised knee.

<doc id="847652" wikidata="Q1162019" url="?curid=847652" title="Piper J-3 Cub">
<text>The Piper J-3 Cub is an American light aircraft that was built between 1938 and 1947 by Piper Aircraft. The aircraft has a simple, lightweight design which gives it good low-speed handling properties and short-field performance. The Cub is Piper Aircraft&#x27;s second most-produced model after the PA-28 Cherokee series (&gt;32,000 produced) with over 20,000 built in the United States. Its simplicity, affordability and popularity invokes comparisons to the Ford Model T automobile.

The aircraft is a high-wing, strut-braced monoplane with a large-area rectangular wing. It is most often powered by an air-cooled, flat-4 piston engine driving a fixed-pitch propeller. Its fuselage is a welded steel frame covered in fabric, seating two people in tandem.

The Cub was designed as a trainer. It had great popularity in this role and as a general aviation aircraft. Due to its performance, it was well suited for a variety of military uses such as reconnaissance, liaison and ground control. It was produced in large numbers during World War II as the L-4 Grasshopper. Many Cubs are still flying today. Cubs are highly prized as bush aircraft.

The aircraft&#x27;s standard chrome yellow paint came to be known as &quot;Cub Yellow&quot; or &quot;Lock Haven Yellow&quot;.

==Design and development==

The Taylor E-2 Cub first appeared in 1930, built by Taylor Aircraft in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Sponsored by William T. Piper, a Bradford industrialist and investor, the affordable E-2 was meant to encourage greater interest in aviation. Later in 1930, the company went bankrupt, with Piper buying the assets, but keeping founder C. Gilbert Taylor on as president. In 1936, an earlier Cub was altered by employee Walter Jamouneau to become the J-2 while Taylor was on sick leave. Some believed the &quot;J&quot; stood for Jamouneau, while aviation historian Peter Bowers concluded the letter simply followed the E, F, G and H models, with the letter &quot;I&quot; skipped because it could be mistaken for the numeral &quot;1&quot;. When he saw the redesign, Taylor was so incensed that he fired Jamouneau. Piper, however, had encouraged Jamouneau&#x27;s changes and hired him back. Piper then bought Taylor&#x27;s share in the company, paying him $250 per month for three years.
Although sales were initially slow, about 1,200 J-2s were produced before a fire in the Piper factory, a former silk mill in Bradford, Pennsylvania, ended its production in 1938. After Piper moved his company from Bradford to Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, the J-3, which featured further changes by Jamouneau, replaced the J-2. The changes integrated the vertical fin of the tail into the rear fuselage structure and covered it simultaneously with each of the fuselage&#x27;s sides, changed the rearmost side window&#x27;s shape to a smoothly curved half-oval outline and placed a steerable tailwheel at the rear end of the J-2&#x27;s leaf spring-style tailskid, linked for its steering function to the lower end of the rudder with springs and lightweight chains to either end of a double-ended rudder control horn. Powered by a 40 hp (30 kW) engine, in 1938, it sold for just over $1,000.

Several alternative air-cooled engines, typically flat-fours, powered the J-3 Cubs, designated J3C when using the Continental A series, J3F using the Franklin 4AC, and J3L with the Lycoming O-145. Very few examples, designated J3P, were equipped with Lenape &quot;Papoose&quot; 3-cylinder radial engines.

The outbreak of hostilities in Europe in 1939, along with the growing realization that the United States might soon be drawn into World War II, resulted in the formation of the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP). The Piper J-3 Cub became the primary trainer aircraft of the CPTP and played an integral role in its success, achieving legendary status. About 75% of all new pilots in the CPTP (from a total of 435,165 graduates) were trained in Cubs. By war&#x27;s end, 80% of all United States military pilots had received their initial flight training in Piper Cubs.

The need for new pilots created an insatiable appetite for the Cub. In 1940, the year before the United States entered the war, 3,016 Cubs had been built. Wartime demands soon increased that production rate to one Cub being built every 20 minutes.
===Flitfire===
Prior to the United States entering World War II, J-3s were part of a fund-raising program to support the United Kingdom. Billed as a &quot;Flitfire&quot;, a Piper Cub J3 bearing Royal Air Force insignia was donated by W. T. Piper and Franklin Motors to the RAF Benevolent Fund to be raffled off. Piper distributors nationwide were encouraged to do the same. On April 29, 1941, all 48 Flitfire aircraft, one for each of the 48 states that made up the country at that time, flew into La Guardia Field for a dedication and fundraising event which included Royal Navy officers from the battleship HMS &quot;Malaya&quot;, in New York for repairs, as honored guests. At least three of the original Flitfires have been restored to their original silver-doped finish.

==Operational history==
===World War II service===


Minutes before the 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, Machinist Mate 2nd Class Marcus F. Poston, a student pilot, was on a solo flight through K-T Flying Service, piloting a Piper Cub J-3 over the valley of Oahu. Poston was flying just as the Japanese planes began appearing over the island and was subsequently shot down. Poston managed to bail out and parachute to safety. The Piper J-3 Cub was the first American plane to be shot down in World War II.

The Piper Cub quickly became a familiar sight. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt took a flight in a J-3 Cub, posing for a series of publicity photos to help promote the CPTP. Newsreels and newspapers of the era often featured images of wartime leaders, such as Generals Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton and George Marshall, flying around European battlefields in Piper Cubs.

Civilian-owned Cubs joined the war effort as part of the newly formed Civil Air Patrol, patrolling the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf Coast in a constant search for German U-boats and survivors of U-boat attacks.

Piper developed a military variant (&quot;All we had to do,&quot; Bill Jr. is quoted as saying, &quot;was paint the Cub olive drab to produce a military airplane&quot;), variously designated as the O-59 (1941), L-4 (after April 1942) and NE (U.S. Navy). The L-4 Grasshopper was mechanically identical to the J-3 civilian Cub, but was distinguishable by the use of a Plexiglas greenhouse skylight and rear windows for improved visibility, much like the Taylorcraft L-2 and Aeronca L-3 also in use with the US armed forces. It had accommodations for a single passenger in addition to the pilot. When carrying only the pilot, the L-4 had a top speed of , a cruise speed of , a service ceiling of , a stall speed of , an endurance of three hours, and a range of . Some 5,413 L-4s were produced for U.S. forces, including 250 built for the U.S. Navy under contract as the NE-1 and NE-2.

All L-4 models, as well as other tandem-seat light aircraft from Aeronca and Taylorcraft, were collectively nicknamed &quot;Grasshoppers&quot;, although any liaison plane, regardless of manufacturer, was often referred to as a &#x27;Cub&#x27;. The L-4 was primarily employed in World War II for artillery spotting and training liaison pilots, but short-range reconnaissance, medical evacuation, and courier or supply missions were not uncommon. During the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, the L-4&#x27;s slow cruising speed and low-level maneuverability made it an ideal observation platform for spotting hidden German guns and armored vehicles waiting in ambush in the hedgerow bocage country south of the invasion beaches. For these and other operations, the pilot generally carried both an observer and communications radio, a load that sometimes exceeded the plane&#x27;s specified gross weight. After the Allied breakout in France, L-4s were occasionally equipped with improvised racks (usually in pairs or quartets) of infantry bazookas for attacking enemy vehicles. The most famous of these unlikely ground attack planes was an L-4 named &quot;Rosie the Rocketer&quot;, piloted by Maj. Charles &quot;Bazooka Charlie&quot; Carpenter, whose six bazooka rocket launchers were credited with eliminating several tanks and armored cars during its wartime service, especially during the Battle of Arracourt. L-4s could also be operated from ships, using the Brodie landing system.

After the war, many L-4s were sold as surplus, but a considerable number were retained in service. L-4s sold as surplus in the U.S. were redesignated as J-3s, but often retained their wartime glazing and paint.

===Postwar===
An icon of the era and of American general aviation, the J-3 Cub has long been loved by pilots and nonpilots alike, with thousands still in use. Piper sold 19,073 J-3s between 1938 and 1947, the majority of them L-4s and other military variants. After the war, thousands of Grasshoppers were civilian-registered under the designation J-3. Sixty-five pre-war Taylor and Piper Cubs were assembled from parts in Canada (by Cub Aircraft Corporation Ltd.). After the war, 130 J-3C-65 models were manufactured in Hamilton, Ontario. Sixteen L-4B models, (known as the Prospector), were later manufactured. The last J-3 model was assembled from parts at Leavens Bros. Toronto in 1952. J-3 Cubs were also assembled in Denmark and Argentina and by a licensee in Oklahoma.

In the late 1940s, the J-3 was replaced by the Piper PA-11 Cub Special (1,500 produced), the first Piper Cub version to have a fully enclosed cowling for its powerplant and then the Piper PA-18 Super Cub, which Piper produced until 1981 when it sold the rights to WTA Inc. In all, Piper produced 2,650 Super Cubs. The Super Cub had a 150 hp (110 kW) engine which increased its top speed to 130 mph (210 km/h). Its range was .
===Korean War service===
On 26 June 1950, one day after the Korean War broke out, the Republic of Korea Air Force flew L-4s to Dongducheon to support the ROK 7th Infantry Division against North Korean military by dropping two bombs from an observer in the rear seat. A total of 70 bombs were dropped until the following day, then aircraft were switched back to reconnaissance mission as bombs were depleted. South Korea lost 25 L-4s throughout the Korean War.

The United States Army also operated small numbers of L-4s, but were replaced by L-16 during the war. The L-4 was in service in many of the same roles it had performed during World War II, such as artillery spotting, forward air control and reconnaissance. Some L-4s were fitted with a high-back canopy to carry a single stretcher for medical evacuation of wounded soldiers.

===Modern production===
Modernized and up-engined versions are produced by Cub Crafters of Washington and by American Legend Aircraft in Texas, as the Cub continues to be sought after by bush pilots for its short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities, as well as by recreational pilots for its nostalgia appeal. The new aircraft are actually modeled on the PA-11, though the Legend company does sell an open-cowl version with the cylinder heads exposed, like the J-3 Cub. An electrical system is standard from both manufacturers.
The J-3 is distinguished from its successors by having a cowl that exposes its engine&#x27;s cylinder heads — the exposed cylinders of any J-3&#x27;s engine were usually fitted with sheet metal &quot;eyebrow&quot; air scoops to direct air over the cylinder&#x27;s fins for more effective engine cooling in flight. Very few other examples exist of &quot;flat&quot; aircraft engine installations (as opposed to radial engines) in which the cylinder heads are exposed. From the PA-11 on through the present Super Cub models, the cowling surrounds the cylinder heads.

A curiosity of the J-3 is that when it is flown solo, the lone pilot normally occupies the rear seat for proper balance, to balance the fuel tank located at the firewall. Starting with the PA-11, as well as some L-4s, fuel was carried in wing tanks, allowing the pilot to fly solo from the front seat.

<text>Leroy Jenkins (March 11, 1932 – February 24, 2007) was an American composer and violinist/violist.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States. As a youth, he lived with his sister, his
mother, two aunts, his grandmother, and, on occasions, a boarder, in a three-bedroom apartment. Jenkins was immersed in music from an early age, and recalled listening to Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and singers such as Billy Eckstine and Louis Jordan. When Jenkins was around eight years old, one of his aunts brought home a boyfriend who played the violin. After hearing him play a difficult Hungarian dance, Jenkins begged his mother for a violin, and was given a red, half-size Montgomery Ward violin that cost twenty-five dollars. He began taking lessons, and was soon heard at St. Luke&#x27;s Baptist Church, where he was frequently accompanied on piano by Ruth Jones, later known as Dinah Washington. Jenkins eventually joined the church choir and orchestra, and performed on the violin at church banquets, teas, and social events.

As a teenager, Jenkins entered DuSable High School, where he switched to clarinet and alto saxophone due to the fact that the school did not have an orchestra, limiting his opportunities to play the violin. During this time, he came under the influence of bandleader &quot;Captain&quot; Walter Dyett. After graduating, Jenkins attended Florida A&amp;M University, where he resumed study of the violin. In 1961, he graduated with a degree in music education, then moved to Mobile, Alabama, where he taught music in the public school system for four years.

==Career==
In the mid-1960s, Jenkins moved back to Chicago, and took a job in the public school system. At one point, he attended an AACM event featuring music by Roscoe Mitchell, performed by Maurice McIntyre, Charles Clark, Malachi Favors, Alvin Fielder, and Thurman Barker. Jenkins recalled being both confused and excited, and was thrilled to be included in a collective improvisation after taking out his violin. He began participating in AACM rehearsals led by Muhal Richard Abrams, recalling: &quot;it was something different, something where I could really be violinistic... I discovered that I would be able to play more of my instrument and I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the cliches... I found out that I could really soar, I found out how I could &quot;really&quot; play.&quot; Jenkins would rehearse and perform with the group for roughly four years, and made his recording debut in 1967 on Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Levels and Degrees of Light&quot;.

During this time, Jenkins began playing in a trio format with fellow AACM members Anthony Braxton and Leo Smith, recording the album &quot;3 Compositions of New Jazz&quot; in 1968. (Abrams also appears on the album.) In 1969, the trio moved to Paris, where they began playing with drummer Steve McCall, who had moved to Europe several years prior, in a group that became known as the Creative Construction Company. While in Paris, Jenkins had to opportunity to perform with a wide range of musicians, including Archie Shepp and Philly Joe Jones, with whom he recorded, Alan Silva, on whose album &quot;Luna Surface&quot; he appeared, and Ornette Coleman, who at one point organized a joint Paris concert featuring the Creative Construction Company, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and Coleman&#x27;s own group. That same year, Jenkins participated in the recording of Braxton&#x27;s album &quot;B-Xo/N-0-1-47a&quot; for BYG Actuel.

In 1970, Jenkins left Paris, later stating that he did not feel comfortable with the fact that he did not speak French, and moved to New York City. Upon his arrival, he reconnected with Coleman and moved into Coleman&#x27;s Artists House loft, where he lived for several months. He recalled: &quot;We stayed downstairs... It was cold down there, where we slept. Ornette gave us a mattress but he didn&#x27;t realize how cold it was.&quot; Coleman served as Jenkins&#x27;s mentor, introducing him to the many musicians who frequented his loft. Meanwhile, Jenkins continued performing and rehearsing with the Creative Construction Company, culminating in a concert at Greenwich Village&#x27;s &quot;Peace Church&quot; on May 19, 1970. The concert, which also featured Muhal Richard Abrams and bassist Richard Davis, was recorded thanks to Coleman, who arranged for an engineer to be present, and was released by Muse Records in two volumes.

Following the May concert, Braxton joined Chick Corea&#x27;s group, which became known as Circle. Jenkins went on to form the Revolutionary Ensemble with bassist Sirone and percussionist Jerome Cooper, a group that would last roughly six years. During the early and mid-1970s, he also performed and recorded with Alice Coltrane, Don Cherry, Carla Bley, Grachan Moncur III, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Paul Motian, Dewey Redman, and Archie Shepp. In 1974, the Jazz Composer&#x27;s Orchestra commissioned Jenkins to compose a large-scale work, resulting in the album &quot;For Players Only&quot;. In 1975, he recorded &quot;Swift Are the Winds of Life&quot;, an album of duets with drummer Rashied Ali. These albums would be followed by over a dozen releases under his name over the next thirty years.

During the late 1970s, Jenkins performed and recorded with pianist/composer Anthony Davis and drummer Andrew Cyrille, and in the early 1980s, he formed a band called Sting, with two violins, two guitars, electric bass, and drums. During this time, in addition to placing in reader and critic polls in Jazz Magazine and DownBeat, he began receiving greater recognition as a composer, garnering commissions and grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Arts, and performances from groups like the Kronos Quartet, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the New Music Consort, the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, and the Cleveland Chamber Symphony, among others. In the late 1980s, Jenkins toured and recorded with Cecil Taylor, and received a commission from Hans Werner Henze, artistic director of the Munich Biennial New Music Theatre Festival, enabling him to compose &quot;Mother of Three Sons&quot;, a dance-opera based on African mythology, in collaboration with choreographer/director Bill T. Jones and librettist Ann T. Greene. The work was premiered in Munich in 1990, and was also performed by the New York City Opera (US premiere, 1991) and the Houston Grand Opera (1992).

The 1990s and 2000s saw a continuation of Jenkins&#x27;s success as a composer. New works included &quot;Fresh Faust&quot;, a jazz-rap opera, written for Boston&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Art; &quot;The Negro Burial Ground&quot;, a cantata presented by The Kitchen and workshopped at UMass Amherst; the opera &quot;The Three Willies&quot;, presented at the Painted Bride in Philadelphia and at the Kitchen; and &quot;Coincidents&quot; an opera with librettist Mary Griffin, performed at Roulette in New York. He also participated in a reunion of the Revolutionary Ensemble, and performed and recorded with the group Equal Interest, which featured Jenkins on violin, Joseph Jarman on woodwinds, and Myra Melford on piano. He collaborated and toured with various choreographers, and formed a world-music improvisation ensemble. In 2004, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. Jenkins also held residencies at a number of American universities, including Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Williams, Brown, Harvard, and Oberlin.

==Death==
Jenkins died from lung cancer on February 24, 2007, in New York City, at the age of 74. At the time of his death he was working on two new operas: &quot;Bronzeville&quot;, a history of South Side Chicago, and &quot;Minor Triad&quot;, a music drama about Paul Robeson, Lena Horne, and Cab Calloway.

<text>A chase gun (or chaser), usually distinguished as bow chaser and stern chaser, was a cannon mounted in the bow (aiming forward) or stern (aiming backward) of a sailing ship. They were used to attempt to slow down an enemy ship either chasing (pursuing) or being chased, when the ship&#x27;s broadside could not be brought to bear. Typically, the chasers were used to attempt to damage the rigging and thereby cause the target to lose performance.

Bow chasers could be regular guns brought up from the gundeck and aimed through specially cut-out ports on either side of the bowsprit, or dedicated weapons made with an unusually long bore and a relatively light ball, and mounted in the bow. Stern chasers could also be improvised, or left permanently in the cabins at the stern, covered up and used as part of the furniture.

==Development==
In the Age of Sail, shiphandling had been brought to a high art, and chases frequently lasted for hours or sometimes days, as each crew fine-tuned their sails to take advantage of small variations in the wind. Chase guns of this era were commonly made of brass rather than iron, as this improved their accuracy. A single lucky shot could cut through a critical line, or cause a sail to split if the wind was strong, so if the ships were within range the best gunners on each would use their chasers to make carefully aimed and timed shots at the other. Despite this, most chase guns were of limited accuracy even when aiming at the sizeable target of an enemy ship&#x27;s rigging. In one eighteenth-century example, a British crew fired seventy-two shots from their vessels&#x27; bow chasers before hitting the sails of a fleeing enemy craft.

By the late eighteenth century, Royal Navy crews were progressively being trained in the use of artillery in chases. The cannons themselves were also modified to maximise their effectiveness as chase guns, including reshaping of their gun carriages to allow for greater elevation and longer range. From 1799 Royal Navy frigates were universally supplied with two bow and two stern chasers, as these were the vessels most likely to be engaged in the pursuit of fleeing enemies.

<text>Funerary texts or funerary literature feature in many belief systems. Its purpose is usually to provide guidance to the newly deceased or the soon-to-be-deceased about how to survive and prosper in the afterlife.

==Antiquity==

The most famous example of funerary literature is that of the ancient Egyptians, whose &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; was buried with the deceased to guide him or her through the various trials that would be encountered before being allowed into the afterlife. The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; followed a tradition of Egyptian funerary literature that dated back as far as the 26th century BC.

Similar practices were followed by followers of the cult of Orpheus, who lived in southern Italy and Crete in the 6th–1st century BC. Their dead were buried with gold plates or laminae on which were inscribed directions about the afterlife.

In Mandaeism, the &quot;Left Ginza&quot; and parts of the &quot;Qulasta&quot; serve as funerary texts.

==Medieval==

Tibetan Buddhists still make use of the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; (also known as &quot;Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;, dating to ca. the 8th century), which describes the experiences of the mind after death. It is recited by lamas over a dying or recently deceased person, or sometimes over an effigy of the deceased.

Pure Land Buddhists regularly recite the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot;, which describes the Buddha Amitabha and Sukhavati, the Western Pure Land, in brief detail. It is ordinarily recited at funerals or at memorial services.

In late 15th-century Europe, the &quot;Ars moriendi&quot; (&quot;The Art of Dying Well&quot;) became one of the most popular and widely circulated early printed books. It was published in Germany around 1470 as a guide to how to meet Death and avoid the temptations (Impatience, Pride, Avarice, etc.) that would consign a soul to purgatory or, worse, to hell.

The &quot;Funeral Oration&quot; (Halotti beszéd) is the oldest extant record of the Hungarian language, dating back to 1192–1195. (, )

<doc id="847701" wikidata="Q1920330" url="?curid=847701" title="Mendenhall Order">
<text>The Mendenhall Order marked a decision to change the fundamental standards of length and mass of the United States from the customary standards based on those of England to metric standards. It was issued on April 5, 1893, by Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the approval of the United States Secretary of the Treasury, John Griffin Carlisle. The order was issued as the Survey&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin No. 26 – Fundamental Standards of Length and Mass&quot;.

==Standards before the order==
In October 1834, the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament were destroyed in a fire, and the British standards of length and mass were also destroyed. &quot;When the new imperial standards to replace them were completed in 1855, two copies of the yard and one copy of the avoirdupois pound were presented to the United States&quot;. These were superior to the yard then in use, so one of them was adopted as the United States national standard yard. These yards were taken to England and re-compared with the imperial yard in 1876 and 1888. The pound provided by the United Kingdom agreed with the United States mint pound, which remained the national standard according to Barbrow and Judson. Hockert claims the UK pound replaced the mint pound.

These were the fundamental standards for customary length and mass measurements in the United States, but the Office of Weights and Measures had other standards for metric measurements.

==Official recognition of the metric system==
The Metric Act of 1866 was passed by Congress and allowed, but did not require, the use of the metric system. Included in the law was a table of conversion factors between the traditional and metric units. The United States Coast Survey (which in 1878 became the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey) Office of Weights and Measures had on hand a number of metric standards, and selected the iron Committee Meter and the platinum Arago Kilogram to be the national standards for metric measurement. The standard yard and pound previously mentioned continued to be the standards for customary measurements.

A series of conferences in France between 1870 and 1875 led to the signing of the Metre Convention and to the permanent establishment of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, abbreviated BIPM after the French name. The BIPM made meter and kilogram standards for all the countries that signed the treaty; the two meters and two kilograms allocated to the United States arrived in 1890, and were adopted as national standards.

== Reasons for the change ==
The imperial standard yard of 1855 was found to be unstable and shortening by measurable amounts. Also, the mint pound was found to be &quot;likewise unfit for use&quot;. For several years before the Mendenhall order was actually issued, the Office of Weights and Measures was &quot;practically forced&quot; to use the metric standards because of their superior stability, and because they were better designed for carrying out precision comparisons. The Office found that the conversion tables in the 1866 law were satisfactory and used them to derive customary length and mass from the metric standards. The conversions were 1 yard = meter and 1 pound = kilogram. Therefore, the Mendenhall order amounted to a formal announcement of a change that had already occurred in practice.

Another motivation for the order was that later that year, in August 1893, an International Electrical Congress would be held in connection with the World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago. Associated with the Congress would be a &quot;Chamber of Delegates&quot;, officially organized for the purpose of coming to an international agreement on units of electrical quantities. As Mendenhall wrote,

==Refinement of the conversions==
The definitions of 1893 remained unchanged for 66 years, but increasing precision in measurements gradually made the differences in the standards in use in English-speaking countries important. By the international yard and pound agreement of July 1, 1959, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed that 1 yard = 0.9144 meter and that 1 avoirdupois pound = kilogram (but see U.S. survey foot).

==Standards versus systems==
Mendenhall ordered that the standards used for the most accurate length and mass comparison change from certain yard and pound objects to certain meter and kilogram objects, but did not require anyone outside of the Office of Weights and Measures to change from the customary units to the metric system.

<text>Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby led the &quot;Who? Who?&quot; ministry, a short-lived British Conservative government which was in power for a matter of months in 1852. Lord Derby was Prime Minister and Benjamin Disraeli served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. It marked the first time the protectionist wing of the Conservative Party had taken office since the Corn Laws schism of 1846. It is also called the First Derby–Disraeli ministry.

Early in 1852 Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, by then very deaf, gave Derby&#x27;s first government its nickname by shouting &quot;Who? Who?&quot; as the list of inexperienced cabinet ministers was read out in the House of Lords.

==History==
After the fall of Lord John Russell&#x27;s Whig government in early 1852, the Conservative leader Lord Derby formed a government. The Conservatives had been weakened by the defection of the Peelites, and many of the new Cabinet ministers were men of little experience. The government became known as the &quot;Who? Who?&quot; Ministry after Wellington&#x27;s comments, due to the lack of prominence of its ministers. The government was in a significant minority, and lasted less than a year, collapsing in December. The Whigs and Peelites then formed a coalition government under the Peelite leader Lord Aberdeen.

Though the government had little impact, it attracted derision through its plethora of new political names, which demonstrated the relative inexperience of the party. Only four members of the Cabinet (Derby himself, St Leonards, Lonsdale, and Herries) were existing Privy Councillors and many others were complete political unknowns.

<doc id="847705" wikidata="Q7097454" url="?curid=847705" title="Operation Save America">
<text>Operation Save America (formerly Operation Rescue National) is a fundamentalist Christian conservative organization based in Concord, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, that opposes human induced abortion and its legality, Islam, and homosexuality. In 1994, Flip Benham became the director of the organization, then called &quot;Operation Rescue National&quot;. Benham replaced Keith Tucci, who had replaced Randall Terry. Terry, Tucci and Benham have all been convicted of crimes related to their protest activities. Rusty Thomas became the national director after Flip Benham stepped down.

Jason Storms is the national director as of 2024.

==Name dispute==
In the late 1990s, Benham abandoned the name of &quot;Operation Rescue&quot;, and changed the name of his organization to &quot;Operation Save America&quot;. Once Newman&#x27;s organization (the former Operation Rescue West or California Operation Rescue) began to grow in prominence and use the name &quot;Operation Rescue&quot;, Benham also began using the name &quot;Operation Rescue&quot;. After a feud with Newman, and after Benham was named in a lawsuit from the United States Department of Justice, Benham officially changed the name of Operation Rescue National to &quot;Operation Save America&quot;. Meanwhile, Benham broadened the scope of Operation Save America to include criticism of homosexuality, pornography, and Islam, and formed alliances with other Christian conservative groups and the Constitution Party. In 2002, Benham moved Operation Save America&#x27;s headquarters from their longtime home in Dallas, Texas to Concord. In 2014 Operation Save America&#x27;s new director Rev. Rusty Thomas moved the headquarters back to Dallas, Texas.

==Activities==
Operation Save America conducts mass protests at abortion clinics to promote an anti-abortion cause. Operation Save America has mobilized its members for other causes common to the Christian right, for example, opposition to Gay-Straight Alliances in public schools. At South Rowan High School, near Charlotte, when a Gay-Straight Alliance was forming at that school in 2006, Operation Save America arranged to have some 700 people to show up at the school board meeting and get the board to ban the club from the school.

They have also been involved in burning the Islamic holy text, the Qur&#x27;an, despite the opposition of most of the Muslim community to the practice of abortion. Their actions have been described as &quot;an affront to Islam, all people of faith, and to our society as a whole... not Christian [and] not American&quot; by the Mississippi Religious Leadership Conference.

On July 12, 2007, three members of the organization (Ante and Kathy Pavkovic, and their daughter Kristen) were arrested after they tried to shout down a Hindu clergyman as he offered the traditional morning prayer on the US Senate floor. The protest was denounced by Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

On July 20, 2014, members of the organization interrupted a worship service at the First Unitarian Universalist Church of New Orleans. During a moment of silence for a member of the church who had died in the previous week, OSA member Deanna Waller began to speak about &quot;abominations&quot;. Rev. Deanna Vandiver, a guest pastor who was leading the service, asked Waller and the other OSA members either to remain and be respectful of the service or to depart; church members escorted Waller and the more vocal OSA protestors out of the service, while others remained until the service was over, and attempted to engage church members during the coffee hour. Vandiver described the intrusion as &quot;religious terrorism&quot;; on its website, OSA described their action as presenting &quot;the truth of the Gospel in this synagogue of Satan.&quot;

On July 21, 2017, concern was expressed by national and local leaders over plans for rallies and protests starting Saturday, July 22, 2017.

On August 2, 2022, a Tennessee federal judge issued a restraining order against the organization after several of their members were arrested during protests at clinics in Nashville, Tennessee and Mt. Juliet in late July.

<text>Jacqueline Courtney (born Sharon Courtney; September 24, 1946 – December 20, 2010) was an American actress best known for her work on daytime soap operas.

Courtney&#x27;s initial appearance on television came in 1951 when she performed on WAAT in Newark.

After short stints on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and &quot;Our Five Daughters&quot;, Courtney became famous for her role as Alice Matthews Frame on &quot;Another World&quot;; she played the role from the show&#x27;s debut in May 1964 until July 1975. It was during the late 1960s that the Alice/Steve/Rachel triangle became one of the hottest storylines on daytime, pairing her with George Reinholt as the charismatic Steve Frame, and setting her in a rivalry with &quot;bad girl&quot; Rachel Davis, played at the time by Robin Strasser and later by Victoria Wyndham.

In 1975, Courtney and Reinholt were fired, allegedly for &quot;storyline purposes.&quot; Head writer Harding Lemay wrote in his memoir, &quot;Eight Years in Another World&quot;, that Courtney was fired because she was a bad actress who refused to learn lines as written, although she had huge popularity with the soap audience. After being dismissed by producer Paul Rauch, Courtney went on to play Pat Ashley on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, where she was reunited with George Reinholt, playing Tony Lord. In 1979, just as Courtney was involved in a storyline involving a psychotic twin sister, Maggie, Robin Strasser joined the cast as Dorian Lord. Courtney remained on the show until September 1983, when the network fired her just before bringing Paul Rauch in as producer.

Courtney reconciled her differences with &quot;Another World&quot; and started back on the show as Alice on the 20th anniversary show in May 1984. She played the role until the next year when she was let go due to lack of story for the character. In 1989 she returned for the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary and for Mackenzie Cory&#x27;s funeral. After a small role as madame Diane Winston on &quot;Loving&quot; in 1987, Courtney retired from acting, though she appeared, alongside Reinholt, on the TV special &quot;50 Years of Soaps: An All-Star Celebration&quot; in 1994.

Courtney died on December 20, 2010, aged 64, from metastatic melanoma. 

In 1973, Courtney received Best Actress, Single Performance, recognition in The First Annual Afternoon TV Writers And Editors Awards.

<doc id="847723" wikidata="Q37827" url="?curid=847723" title="Drentse Patrijshond">
<text>The Drentsche Patrijshond is a versatile spaniel-type hunting dog from the Dutch province of Drenthe. Called the Dutch Partridge Dog (or &quot;Drent&quot; for Drenthe) in English, approximately 5,000 dogs are registered with the breed club in the Netherlands, and breed clubs operate in Belgium, Denmark, Scandinavia and North America. The Drentsche Patrijshond bears some resemblance to both spaniel and setter types of dog. An excellent pointer and retriever, this dog is often used to hunt fowl and adapts equally well to the field or marshes.

==Appearance==
Valid color is white with brown or orange markings. Mostly white with large brown plates (spots). There is usually one plate that covers the backside above the tail. A mantle (large marking across the back) is permissible, but generally less desired. The coat is medium long, with feathers on the leg and longer hair on the front of the chest, giving the impression of a longer-haired coat. The Drentsche Patrijshond is 55 to 63 cm (22 to 25 in). at the withers. The breed weighs 48-73 pounds on average.

==History==

The origins of the Drentsche Patrijshond are in the 16th century, from the Spioenen (or Spanjoelen) which came to the Netherlands through France from Spain, and is related to the Small Münsterländer of Germany and the Epagneul Français of France. In the Netherlands, these dogs were called &quot;partridge dogs&quot;. 

The presence of the partridge dogs had been visible for centuries, as in the 17th-century painting &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Present&quot;, c. 1658–60, by Gabriel Metsu. In the painting, the partridge dog leans against the hunter&#x27;s knee, as the man is handing a woman a partridge, which was a double entendre at the time. The dog in &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Present&quot; is a very large, stocky dog that could possibly pull a cart; showing the range of the early type, a much smaller, lighter dog of the same type is shown in another painting by the same artist, &quot;The Poultry seller&quot;, 1662. This painting also involves a woman being offered a bird, regarded with suspicion by her dog.

Before formal recognition as a breed in 1943, the type had been kept separate from other dogs as an undocumented breed for centuries in the rural province of Drenthe. As the Drentsche Patrijshond is a breed developed in the Netherlands, the breed standard was first developed and approved in 1943 by the Raad van Beheer op Kynologisch Gebied (Dutch Kennel Club), the Fédération Cynologique Internationale national kennel club for the Netherlands. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognised the breed using the standard developed by the breed&#x27;s country of origin as the standard to be used in international competition. The United Kennel Club in the United States also recognises the breed using the outdated (February 1994) Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard. 

In November 2010, the Drentsche Patrijshond was added to the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program, allowing owners of registered Drents to participate in AKC sanctioned events such as hunt tests and agility competitions, starting in 2011.

== Use ==
The province of Drenthe 300 years ago was unusual, in that it allowed the common gentry the right to hunt. The local mayor, the farmer, and landowners in general developed dogs to support their pursuit of various small game. Unlike many other hunting breeds, which were developed by, and for, the elite or nobility only to hunt, the Drentsche Patrijshond was expected to hunt all game, and also pull duty as watch dog, child playmate, etc. Some were even used to pull the dog-carts of the day. For over 300 years, the Drentsche Patrijshond type has been an all-around dog.

Perfectly suited to the walk-up (upland) hunter, the Drent is thorough, in order to find all the game on the smaller plots available in Drenthe. It hunts with good speed, within reach of the gun. As with most European versatile breeds, the Drentsche Patrijshond points and retrieves, and will hunt both birds and small mammals, including rabbit, hare and fox. Today, the Drent is a favorite gun dog throughout its native country of the Netherlands, with approximately 5,000 dogs registered with the breed club.

== Health ==
Breed health concerns may include progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and hereditary stomatocytosis.

== Temperament ==
Though the breed shows a strong hunting instinct in the field, and can be quite driven, these dogs tend to be more relaxed in the home than many of the hunting breeds. They are strongly attached to family members, loyal, and of sweet disposition, particularly with children.

== Exercise ==
Happiest when working alongside a hunter, the Drent enjoys the company of humans in the great outdoors. Several brisk turns around the park will satisfy it as well. Although it will come home and quietly assume its position on its bed, it should not be mistaken for a sedentary dog - the breed will suffer if insufficiently exercised.

<text>The Cessna 120, 140, and 140A, are single-engine, two-seat, conventional landing gear (tailwheel), light general aviation aircraft that were first produced in 1946, immediately following the end of World War II. Production ended in 1951, and was succeeded in 1959 by the Cessna 150, a similar two-seat trainer which introduced tricycle gear. Combined production of the 120, 140, and 140A was 7,664 units in five years.

==Development==

===Cessna 140===

The Cessna 140 was originally equipped with a Continental C-85-12 or C-85-12F horizontally opposed, air-cooled, four-cylinder piston engine of . The Continental C-90-12F or C-90-14F of was optional, as was the Lycoming O-235-C1 engine, an aftermarket installation authorized in the type certificate. This model had a metal fuselage and fabric wings with metal control surfaces. The larger Cessna 170 was a four-seat 140 with a more powerful engine.
===Cessna 120===

The Cessna 120 was an economy version of the 140 produced at the same time. It had the same engine as the 140, but lacked wing flaps. The rear-cabin &quot;D&quot; side windows and electrical system (radios, lights, battery and starter) were optional. A 120 outfitted with every factory option would be nearly equivalent to a 140, but the International Cessna 120/140 Association believes that no 120s were originally built this way. Despite this, many decades&#x27; worth of owner-added options have rendered many 120s almost indistinguishable from a 140 aside from the absence of wing flaps. The 120 was dropped from production upon introduction of the 140A in 1949.
===Cessna 140A===

In 1949, Cessna introduced the 140A, a new variant with aluminum-covered wings and single wing struts instead of the fabric wing covering, dual &quot;V&quot; struts, and jury struts fitted on earlier models. Standard engines were the Continental C-90-12F or C-90-14F of , with the Continental C-85-12, C-85-12F, or C-85-14F engines optional. The spring-steel gear had been swept forward on 120 and 140 models in late 1947 so landing gear extenders were no longer necessary to counter nose-over tendencies during heavy application of brakes; all 140A models had the improved gear legs. Despite these improvements, sales of the 140 lineup faltered, and the 140A comprised only seven percent of overall 120/140 production.

==Modifications==
Common modifications to the Cessna 120 and 140 include:

*&quot;Metalized&quot; wings, where the fabric is replaced with light-gauge sheet aluminum, eliminating the need to periodically replace the wing fabric.
*The installation of landing gear extenders to reduce the tendency of the aircraft to nose over on application of heavy braking. These were factory-optional equipment.
*Installation of rear-cabin &quot;D&quot; side windows on 120s that were not originally so equipped.
*Installation of electrical systems on 120s that were not originally so equipped, allowing owners to install an electric starter, more sophisticated avionics and/or lights for night flying.
*Installation of a more powerful engine. A popular conversion today is to replace the original C-85 or C-90 with a 100 hp (75 kW) Continental O-200. A kit is available to install a Lycoming O-320 but this conversion is less prevalent due to a roughly 100 lb (45 kg) weight penalty and a sharp increase in fuel consumption.

<text>Michael James Adams (May 5, 1930 – November 15, 1967) (Maj USAF) was an American aviator, aeronautical engineer, and USAF astronaut. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA.

On November 15, 1967, Adams flew X-15 Flight 191 (also known as X-15 Flight 3-65-97) aboard the X-15-3, one of three planes in the X-15 fleet. Flying to an altitude above 50 miles, Adams qualified as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space. Moments later the craft broke apart, killing Adams and destroying the X-15-3. He was the first American space mission fatality by the American convention.

==Background==
===Early life and military experience===
Adams was born May 5, 1930, in Sacramento, California. He graduated from Sacramento Junior College. He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1950, and earned his pilot wings and commission in 1952 at Webb Air Force Base, Texas. He served as a fighter-bomber pilot during the Korean War, where he flew 49 combat missions. This was followed by 30 months with the 613th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at England Air Force Base, Louisiana, and six months rotational duty at Chaumont Air Base in France.

===Education and flight experience===
In 1958, Adams received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma and, after 18 months of astronautics study at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was selected in 1962 for the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Here, he won the A.B. Honts Trophy as the best scholar and pilot in his class. Adams subsequently attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS), graduating with honors in December 1963. He was one of four Edwards aerospace research pilots to participate in a five-month series of NASA Moon landing practice tests at the Martin Company in Baltimore, Maryland. In November 1965, he was selected to be an astronaut in the United States Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory program. In July 1966, Major Adams came to the North American X-15 program, a joint USAF/NASA project. He made his first X-15 flight on October 6, 1966.

===Death===

Adams&#x27;s seventh X-15 flight, Flight 3-65-97, took place on November 15, 1967. He reached a peak altitude of ; the nose of the aircraft was off heading by 15 degrees to the right. While descending, at the aircraft encountered rapidly increasing aerodynamic pressure which impinged on the airframe, causing the X-15 to enter a violent Mach 5 spin. As the X-15 neared , it was diving at Mach 3.93 and experiencing more than 15 &quot;g&quot; vertically (positive and negative), and 8 g laterally, which inevitably exceeded the design limits of the aircraft. The aircraft broke up 10 minutes and 35 seconds after launch, killing Adams. The United States Air Force posthumously awarded him Astronaut Wings for his last flight.

An excerpt from NASA&#x27;s biography page on Mike Adams discusses findings from the crash investigation:

:Ground parties scoured the countryside looking for wreckage; critical to the investigation was the film from the cockpit camera. The weekend after the accident, an unofficial FRC (Fleet Readiness Centers) search party found the camera; disappointingly, the film cartridge was nowhere in sight. Engineers theorized that the film cassette, being lighter than the camera, might be further away, blown north by winds at altitude. FRC (Fleet Readiness Centers) engineer Victor Horton organized a search and on 29 November, during the first pass over the area, Willard E. Dives found the cassette. Most puzzling was Adams&#x27;s complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation. The accident board concluded that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate as the result of a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible vertigo. The electrical disturbance early in the flight degraded the overall effectiveness of the aircraft&#x27;s control system and further added to pilot workload. The MH-96 adaptive control system then caused the airplane to break up during reentry.

His remains were buried at the Mulhearn Memorial Park Cemetery, Monroe, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana.

==Awards and honors==
During his military career he was awarded:
* Astronaut Wings, posthumously
* Air Medal
* Air Force Commendation Medal
* Korean Service Medal
* United Nations Service Medal for Korea
* National Defense Service Medal with 1 Bronze Service Star
* Air Force Longevity Service Award with 4 clusters
* Air Force Good Conduct Medal
* A.B. Honts Trophy

==Memorials==
In 1991, Adams&#x27;s name was added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

On June 8, 2004, a memorial monument to Adams was erected near the crash site, northwest of Randsburg, California.

<text>John William Bosley (May 4, 1947 – April 28, 2022) was a Canadian politician. He was best known for having been speaker of the House of Commons from November 5, 1984 to September 29, 1986.

== Biography ==

Bosley received a BA in 1968 from Trinity College in the University of Toronto. Prior to his election to Parliament, he was a businessman. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, he was first elected in the 1979 election in the riding of Don Valley West in Toronto. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister Joe Clark.

He was re-elected in the 1980 and 1984 elections. After the 1984 election, he was named Speaker of the House of Commons.

On June 27, 1985, the House adopted changes to the Standing Orders, providing for the election of the Speaker by secret ballot. The first such election took place on September 30, 1986, when Bosley tendered his resignation, and presided over the election of John Fraser as the thirty-second Speaker of the House of Commons.

Bosley was re-elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1988 election. He ran against incumbent John Fraser in the second election for Speaker but was unsuccessful.

He was defeated in the 1993 general election in which the Progressive Conservative Party was reduced from 157 MPs to two.

Starting in 1993, Bosley served as Advisor on Institutional Development to Parliaments all over the world but primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2002, Bosley received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and in 2012 the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

<text>Pittodrie Stadium, commonly referred to as Pittodrie, from which the surrounding residential area has taken its name, is an all-seater stadium in Aberdeen, Scotland. Used primarily for football, it has been the home ground of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) club Aberdeen F.C. since they were formed in 1903. Prior to then, the ground hosted the original Aberdeen F.C. from 1899 until the merger that created the present club.

With a seating capacity of ; Pittodrie is the fourth largest stadium in the SPFL and the largest stadium in Scotland outside the Central Belt. Pittodrie has been the location of a number of firsts in the field of stadium design, including the invention of the dugout, and in 1978 became one of the first all-seater stadium in the United Kingdom.

, Pittodrie has hosted fifteen matches involving the Scotland national team. The ground has also staged rugby union, with four Scotland international fixtures being held there including a match against the Barbarians. In club football, Inverness Caledonian Thistle temporarily shared Pittodrie during part of the 2004–05 season.

==History==
The original Aberdeen football club was formed in 1881. They played at various venues within the city, until a former dung hill for police horses was cleared and readied for football in 1899. The land was leased from Mr Knight Erskine of Pittodrie, with an agreement to construct a terrace on what is now the site of the Richard Donald Stand. The first game, a 7–1 win over Dumbarton, was played on 2 September 1899. The club was merged on 18 April 1903 with two other local clubs, Victoria United and Orion, to form Aberdeen FC. 8000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen FC play its first game at Pittodrie, a 1–1 draw in the Northern League against Stenhousemuir on 15 August 1903. The club joined the Scottish Football League in 1904.

Increasing popularity of the team and rising attendances led to major developments at Pittodrie in the 1920s. The club purchased the ground, which they had been leasing, with the final payment made on 1 December 1920. The Main Stand, where the club offices, dressing rooms and trophy room are located, was constructed in 1925. This was partly funded by the sale of Alex Jackson to Huddersfield Town. Also in the 1920s, the dugout was introduced to football by Aberdeen coach Donald Colman, who was interested in sitting lower to the pitch in order to inspect the players&#x27; footwork.
The club won its first major trophy in 1947, when it won the Scottish Cup. With increased success came more additions to Pittodrie. The record attendance occurred on 13 March 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match against Hearts. Floodlights were introduced at Pittodrie on 21 October 1959, when English league side Luton Town were beaten 3–2 in a friendly. By 1 August 1968, the Main Stand had become all-seated as part of a £100,000 improvement of the ground. This coincided with a change of name from Pittodrie Park to Pittodrie Stadium. On 6 February 1971, a fire destroyed part of the Main Stand, and gutted the dressing rooms and club offices. The Scottish Cup trophy, which was held by Aberdeen at the time, had to be rescued by firemen.

In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all-seated stadium in Great Britain, after the south terracing was fitted with bench style seating. This improvement pre-dated the Taylor Report on British football grounds by a decade and coincided with a distinct upturn in the fortunes of the home team, now managed by Alex Ferguson. The south side became the South Stand in 1980, following the installation of a cantilever roof which covered most of the seats. A year later, the benches were replaced by individual seats.

Both during the subsequent run in the 1980s and at numerous other times over the century the stadium has been in operation, there have been many memorable nights for the local fans. However, Pittodrie&#x27;s greatest night is generally regarded as 16 March 1983. Aberdeen fought back from 2–1 down in a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup quarter-final second leg tie against Bayern Munich to win 3–2. A full house witnessed this victory, which took the Dons through to the semi-finals, and they went on to win the trophy by defeating Real Madrid in the final. The club installed 24 executive boxes in the Main Stand, and built a new roof over the Merkland Road End in 1985. Undersoil heating was installed in 1987.
The most recent development of the stadium came in the 1992–93 season when the Beach End stand on the east side of the ground was demolished, with the new Richard Donald stand - named after the club&#x27;s long serving chairman - constructed in its place. On 1 August 1993, the new stand was opened with a League Cup tie against Clydebank. The official opening was carried out later in 1993 by Princess Anne. It is currently the only two tier stand in the stadium. The stadium has remained relatively unchanged since then, although some minor improvements, such as the introduction of an electronic stadium entry system for the 2006–07 season, have been carried out.

The site of the stadium is only 550 yards away from the North Sea, and with only the King&#x27;s Links golf course between the stadium and the beach, the ground is one of the coldest football grounds in Britain.

As a result of a ground sharing agreement, Pittodrie was used by Inverness Caledonian Thistle for their home matches during the early part of the 2004–05 season. This was required because Inverness CT&#x27;s own Caledonian Stadium did not meet the requirements for entry into the Scottish Premier League until improvements were carried out and the seating capacity increased. In 2005 the stadium size criterion for entry to the SPL was reduced to 6,000, thereby allowing Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium partway during the season.

In March 2020 the club announced plans to reduce the operational capacity of Pittodrie to 15,500. Despite this, attendances in the 2023-24 season have been reported from 15,000 to 18,652.

==Structure and facilities==


The Main Stand was the original grandstand within the ground, and contains much of the staff and offices responsible for the day-to-day running of the stadium, from the boot room to the trophy room. Teams enter the pitch from a tunnel to the extreme left of this stand. As befits a main stand, this section of the ground includes both padded seating for club officials and VIPs, and several executive boxes at the rear. There are a number of pillars running along this stand, supporting the roof. As a consequence, views in some places are restricted. It remains, however, the most expensive stand from which to watch matches. To the east of the Main Stand is the club shop, which doubles as a ticket office.

The Richard Donald Stand is named after former club chairman Dick Donald. Completed in 1993, it houses over 6,000 fans, although this is a reduction on its Beach End predecessor. It is a cantilever construction with two tiers and a row of twelve executive boxes in between. It is commonly referred to as simply the &quot;RDS&quot;. It was built by the present chairman&#x27;s construction firm, the Stewart Milne Group, at a cost of £4.5 million. Within this stand are a number of banqueting rooms, which are used for corporate hospitality and outside bookings.

Taking its name from the street behind it, the Merkland Stand (also known as &#x27;the Paddock&#x27; or &#x27;King Street End&#x27;) sits behind the goal, on the west of the ground. The Merkland is Aberdeen F.C.&#x27;s family stand, with reduced prices for under-twelves and families. There is also a section for disabled supporters near the pitch. The stand itself is a covered enclosure, with two pillars supporting the roof. The entrance to the stand is dominated by a façade constructed from granite, a local stone.

Named simply after its position within the ground, the South Stand was originally an undeveloped embankment which was later remodelled as a standing terrace. Seating and a cantilever roof were later added, although some of the 8,400 seats remain uncovered. Since 1993, the easternmost part of the stand has been used to house away fans. Sections P, Q and R are designated for this purpose. The television gantry and commentary positions are housed in this stand.

==Future developments==
Despite improvements and its ground-breaking past, it appears that the future of Pittodrie as a football stadium is uncertain. Plans are in action for the club to move to a New Aberdeen Stadium. The principle of a move, rather than a redevelopment of Pittodrie, has already been recommended by Aberdeen City Council. An earlier plan to move to the edge of the city, which corresponded with Scotland&#x27;s failed joint bid for the Euro 2008 tournament, was scrapped.

In June 2006, the club&#x27;s two major shareholders agreed a plan to sell the land on which the stadium sits to clear some of the club&#x27;s debt.

During the late 2010s, construction began at Kingsford on the western edge of the city which led to the completion of a new training facility, Cormack Park, in 2019; however, the proposed stadium on the same site was put on hiatus due to economic issues, and in 2021 alternative designs at the city&#x27;s beachfront close to Pittodrie were released.

==Other uses==
Since its construction, there have been fifteen Scotland international matches staged at Pittodrie. Normally the national team&#x27;s home matches are played at Hampden Park in Glasgow, but during times of redevelopment of the national stadium, or matches which are expected to draw a low crowd, the Scottish Football Association has made use of other stadia in the country. Playing at Pittodrie, Scotland have won ten matches, drawn two and lost three. The most recent was a 1–0 loss to Netherlands on 9 November 2017.






===Rugby union===
Since 2005, Pittodrie has hosted four rugby union internationals.

===Concerts===
Pittodrie has been used for concerts; both Elton John and Rod Stewart have played at Pittodrie.

<doc id="847744" wikidata="Q141703" url="?curid=847744" title="The Futureheads">
<text>The Futureheads are an English post-punk band from Sunderland, formed in 2000. The band consists of Ross Millard (vocals and guitar), David &quot;Jaff&quot; Craig (vocals and bass guitar) and brothers Barry Hyde (vocals and guitar) and Dave Hyde (drums). Their name comes from the title of the Flaming Lips album &quot;Hit to Death in the Future Head&quot;. The band&#x27;s influences include new wave and post-punk bands such as Gang of Four, Devo, XTC, Wire and Fugazi.

==Career==
===Early days===
The band met at City of Sunderland College as a quartet consisting of Barry Hyde (vocals and guitar), David &quot;Jaff&quot; Craig (vocals and bass guitar), Peter Brewis (drums), and Ross Millard (vocals and guitar). Millard and Craig had been in another local band together previously. They used the Sunderland City Detached Youth Project building (where Brewis and Hyde worked) as a free practice space, fitting since the project was intended to get young people off the streets by using music. They first performed in 2000, and through word-of-mouth their reputation in the local area grew. Hyde&#x27;s younger brother Dave replaced Brewis (who went on to form Field Music).

In an interview with Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;4Music&quot;, Barry Hyde revealed that Dave Hyde was given a golden guitar by his parents when he was young. But Barry had taken it off him to learn to strum his first chords. Dave was left with nothing, forcing him to take up the drums.

===2003–2005: self-titled first album===
The Futureheads played their first gig at Ashbrooke Cricket and Rugby Club in December 2000. They debuted with their 2002 &quot;Nul Book Standard&quot; and 2003 &quot;1-2-3-Nul!&quot; EPs, and later that year released their first single, &quot;First Day&quot;, on 4 August. &quot;First Day&quot; peaked at No. 58 on the UK Singles Chart in August 2003.

The Futureheads released their self-titled debut album in September 2004 on 679 Recordings. Five of the tracks were produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four. The rest of the album was produced by Paul Epworth. The song &quot;Decent Days and Nights&quot; from the album was featured in the video game soundtrack to &quot;Burnout 3&quot; on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as EA&#x27;s &quot;Rugby 2005&quot;.

On 21 February 2005, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, a cover of the Kate Bush song, was released as a single. It reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart in its first week, and was named Single of the Year by &quot;NME&quot;. The band toured the United States with Franz Ferdinand and later supported the Pixies, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol.

They performed at BBC Radio One&#x27;s One Big Weekend, held in their home town of Sunderland over the weekend of 7–8 May 2005. On 8 May 2005, Sunderland A.F.C. picked up the Championship trophy. In tribute, the Futureheads performed a set live at the Stadium of Light as pre-match entertainment.

===2005–2006: &quot;News and Tributes&quot;===

The stand-alone EP, &quot;Area&quot; was released in November 2005 while the band was working on their second album &quot;News and Tributes&quot; (name inspired by the Munich air disaster in 1958), which, according to &quot;NME&quot; in February 2006, took only five weeks to produce. The first single from the album was &quot;Skip to the End&quot; released on 15 May. The album &quot;News and Tributes&quot; was first released on 29 May 2006.

The band became disillusioned with major label music business and being under contract, and were released by 679 Recordings. Hyde said: &quot;we were desperate to get out of the record deal, they could easily have kept us and made us try and make more records but we didn&#x27;t want that&#x27;.

===2006–2008: &quot;This Is Not the World&quot;===
Throughout the rest of 2006, The Futureheads started their own independent record label, Nul Records, and started working on songs for their next album.

In June 2007, they reportedly completed work on their third album, &quot;This Is Not the World,&quot; which was released in May 2008. Millard said that he expected the new album to be punkier than the last album. He also revealed that the band was close to splitting during the time after the second album was released.

The band made a free download called &quot;Broke Up the Time&quot; available from their website on 9 November 2007. They also announced three gigs in the UK followed by a full UK tour and set up their own label, Nul Records exclusively to distribute Futureheads material. In December 2007, the band released a video of them walking around Carnaby Street, London to the single &quot;The Beginning of the Twist&quot;. It was also accompanied by a free download of a song called &quot;Crash&quot;.

The second single from their album, &quot;Radio Heart&quot; was released on 19 May 2008 from their album &quot;This Is Not The World&quot; followed by the release of the music video for the single on 16 April. A third single from the album, &quot;Walking Backwards&quot;, was released on 4 August 2008.

===2008–2010: &quot;The Chaos&quot;===
The single &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Be Like This If You Were Here&quot; was released on 8 December 2008. In 2009, the band played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe – Przystanek Woodstock in Poland. In November 2009, the band allowed fans to download a new free track, &quot;Struck Dumb&quot;, for a period of two weeks. The band released their fourth album entitled &quot;The Chaos&quot;, on 26 April 2010 in the UK. &quot;The Chaos&quot; was released in the US on 1 June 2010 on Dovecote Records.

===2011–2019: &quot;Rant&quot;, and hiatus===
In 2011, the Futureheads performed in an event organised by the Sunderland A.F.C. foundation called Foundation of Light.

The Futureheads released their fifth full-length album, &quot;Rant&quot;, on 2 April 2012. In a change from their usual style, this album is entirely a cappella. The album contains re-recordings of Futureheads songs, their own renditions of several traditional folk songs plus several covers of pop and dance songs. &quot;Rant&quot; was nominated for the Artrocker Album of the Year award in 2012.

In a 2015 interview on BBC Radio 6 Music, Dave Hyde said that the Futureheads are no longer a working band, with both his brother Barry and Jaff teaching; Barry Hyde was also working on a &quot;piano-based&quot; solo album. However, the band got together to record a health awareness video using their song &quot;Heartbeat Song&quot; for BUPA which was released in April 2016.

===2019–present: Reunion, and &quot;Powers&quot;===
In January 2019, the band announced on social media they had reformed, had written and recorded new material during 2018, and their first tour dates since 2013. On 5 June, they released &quot;Jekyll&quot;, the lead single from their first album in seven years, &quot;Powers&quot;, which was later released on 30 August.

===Other projects===
Ross Millard is a member of Frankie &amp; the Heartstrings, contributing to their third album &quot;Decency&quot; in 2015. Dave Hyde is one-half of the duo Hyde &amp; Beast with Neil Bassett, formerly of the Golden Virgins. Jaff occasionally performs with School of Language.

In June 2016, Barry Hyde released his debut solo album, &quot;Malody&quot;, on Sirenspire Records. The previous year he released &quot;Ivory Cutlery&quot; online - an EP containing Ivor Cutler covers. The debut album was recorded at First Avenue Studios in Heaton, Newcastle with Dave Curle in late 2014 and early 2015. &quot;Malody&quot; (a cross between the words &quot;melody&quot; and &quot;malady&quot;) features 11 songs, including two cover versions: &quot;Sometimes It Snows in April&quot; by Prince and &quot;Lonely&quot; by Tom Waits. The album, especially in the first five tracks (under-titled &quot;The Malody Suite&quot;), chronicles Hyde&#x27;s personal experiences with chronic mental illness, a subject which he has spoken openly about in interviews and performances.

<text>Gundeshapur (, &quot;Weh-Andiōk-Ŝābuhr&quot;; New Persian: , &quot;Gondēshāpūr&quot;) was the intellectual centre of the Sassanid Empire and the home of the Academy of Gundeshapur, founded by Sassanid Emperor Shapur I. Gundeshapur was home to a teaching hospital and had a library and a centre of higher learning. It has been identified with extensive ruins south of Shahabad, a village 14 km south-east of Dezful, to the road for Shushtar, in the present-day province of Khuzestan, southwest Iran.

The town fell into decline after the Islamic conquest of Persia, the city surrendering in 638. However, it continued to remain an important centre in the Islamic period. Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar, the founder of the Saffarid dynasty, made Gundeshapur his residence three years before his sudden death in 879. His tomb became one of the most prominent sites in the city.

==Name==
The Middle Persian word &quot;Gondēŝāhpūr&quot; (or &quot;Gonde Ŝāhpur&quot;) may be from the Persian expression &quot;wandēw Šāhpur&quot;, means &quot;acquired by Shapur&quot;, or from &quot;Gund-dēz-i Shāpūr&quot;, means &quot;military fortress of Shapur&quot;, or from &quot;Weh-Andiyok-Shāpūr&quot;, &quot;Better-than-Antioch of Shapur&quot;. It is known as گندی‌شاپور &quot;Gondēshāpūr&quot; in New Persian. 

In Classical Syriac, the town was called &quot;Bēth Lapaṭ&quot; sometimes rendered as &quot;Bethlapeta&quot; in English, in Greek &quot;Bendosabora&quot;; and in &quot;Jundaysābūr.&quot;

==The Rise of Gundeshapur==

After his conquest of the Roman city of Antioch in 256, the Sasanian King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) Shapur I founded the city of Gundeshapur, situated between Susa and Shushtar. The city, constructed as a place to settle Roman prisoners of war, subsequently became a Sasanian royal winter residence and the capital of the Khuzistan province. Gundeshapur was one of the four main cities of the province, along with Susa, Karka d-Ledan, and Shushtar. Gundeshapur was mainly inhabited by Christians, and served as the East-Syrian metropolitan see of Bet Huzaye.

Most scholars believe Shāpur I, son of Ardeshir (Artaxexes), to have founded the city after defeating a Roman army led by Emperor Valerian. Gundeshapur was a garrison town and housed many Roman prisoners of war. Shāpur I made Gundeshapur his capital.

Shāpur&#x27;s wife, the daughter of Aurelian, lived in the capital with him. She brought with her two Greek physicians who settled in the city and taught Hippocratic medicine.

In 489, the Nestorian theological and scientific center in Edessa was ordered closed by the Byzantine emperor Zeno, and transferred itself to become the School of Nisibis or Nisibīn, then under Persian rule with its secular faculties at Gundeshapur, Khuzestan. Here, scholars, together with Pagan philosophers banished from Athens by Justinian in 529, carried out important research in medicine, astronomy, and mathematics&quot;.

It was under the rule of the Sassanid monarch Khusraw I (531-579 CE), called Anushiravan &quot;The Immortal&quot; and known to the Greeks and Romans as Chosroes, that Gundeshapur became known for medicine and erudition. Khusraw I gave refuge to various Greek philosophers, Nestorian Assyrians fleeing religious persecution by the Byzantine empire.

The emperor commissioned the refugees to translate Greek and Syriac texts into Pahlavi. They translated various works on medicine, astronomy, astrology, philosophy, and useful crafts.

Anushiravan also turned towards the east, and sent the famous physician Borzouye to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to Gundeshapur. These visitors translated Indic texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine and Chinese texts on herbal medicine and religion. Borzouye is said to have himself translated the still popular Indic &quot;Pañcatantra&quot; from Sanskrit into Persian as &quot;Kelile væ Demne&quot;.

Many Assyrians settled in Gundeshapur during the fifth century. The Assyrians were most of all medical doctors from Urfa, which was during that time, home to the leading medical center. Teaching in the Academy was done in Syriac until the city fell to Arab-Islamic armies, which destroyed the city and places of learning.

== Gundeshapur under Arab-Islamic rule ==
Sassanid Persia fell to Arab-Islamic armies in 638 CE. The academy survived the change of rulers and persisted for several centuries, by projecting itself as a Muslim institute of higher learning. In 832 CE, Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mūn founded the &quot;Bayt al-Hikma&quot;, the House of Wisdom. There the methods of Gundeshapur were emulated since the House of Wisdom was staffed with graduates of the older Academy of Gundeshapur who had been trained heavily in Indic and some Greek and Iranian medical traditions. It is believed that the House of Wisdom was disbanded under Al-Mutawakkil, Al-Ma&#x27;mūn&#x27;s successor who felt learning conflicted with the information given in the Quran. In addition, the intellectual center of the Abbasid Caliphate had shifted to the Arab stronghold of Baghdad, as henceforth there are few references in contemporary literature to universities or hospitals at Gundeshapur.

Gundeshapur had been major link between Indic and some Greek medicine, because of its previous practices of combining the medical traditions, therefore the transition from earlier ancient civilisations to later Islamic appropriation was more coherent.

The last attested head of the Gundeshapur hospital was Sābur bin Sahl who died in 869. The fate of the hospital after this is unknown.

== Recent academic doubts ==

Some scholars have cast doubts on the existence of the hospital at Gundeshapur by claiming that there are no known surviving Persian sources &quot;that would corroborate the claims that [Gundeshapur] played a crucial role in medical history&quot;. It has been assumed that a medical center at Gundeshapur would have resembled the School of Nisibis. What is more likely is there existed a seminary, like the one in Nisibis, where medical texts were read, and an infirmary, where medicine was practiced.

Additionally, Gundeshapur&#x27;s reputation may have been conflated with that of Susa, a city to the west of Gundeshapur and with which Gundesahur was administratively linked. Ath-Tha&#x27;ālibi, a scholar with access to Sassanian royal annals, discussing pre-Islamic Persia, wrote:
 On the other hand, the same source might be another confirmation of the medical reputation of Gundeshapur as Susa may represent the whole local region which included Gundeshapur (as they were administratively linked). This is enforced by the fact that Ahwāz and Fārs, mentioned in the quote for comparison to Susa, were regions as well, an indication that regions were being compared.

<text>Tannadice Park, officially known as The CalForth Construction Arena for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium in Dundee, Scotland. It is the home ground of Dundee United F.C., who have played at Tannadice since the club was founded as Dundee Hibernian in 1909. The stadium has been all-seated since 1994 and has a capacity of . It is located only 200 yards (183 metres) from Dundee F.C.&#x27;s stadium, Dens Park; the two are the closest senior football grounds in the UK.

The ground was previously known as Clepington Park, and was used by a number of local teams in the 19th century. It was the home of Dundee Wanderers F.C. from 1894 until 1909, including their single season in membership of the Scottish Football League (1894–95). The name of the ground was changed to Tannadice when Dundee Hibernian took over the lease in 1909.

==History==

===Early days (1870s–1919)===

The ground that is now Tannadice (then called Clepington Park) was first used for football in the 1870s, when the surrounding area of Dundee was still largely open countryside. In July 1882, Dundee East End secured the use of Clepington Park for the coming season, remaining there until the following year, when they moved to Madeira Park. Clepington was also used by newly formed junior club Dundee Violet during the 1883–84 season.

Both clubs vacated Clepington in 1884; Violet relocated to Fairmuir, while East End had spells at Madeira Park and Pitkero Park before returning to Clepington in 1887. They remained there until moving to Carolina Port, the most developed ground in Dundee at the time, in 1891. East End would subsequently amalgamate with Dundee Our Boys to form Dundee F.C. in 1893. Clepington Park was subsequently taken over by Johnstone Wanderers, who had begun as an offshoot of Our Boys.

By this time, the surrounding modern street pattern had begun to emerge, with Provost Road, Arklay Street, and Clepington Road all having been laid out. West of Arklay Street remained open land while the east was being developed. By 1890, one of the new streets leading off Arklay Street had been given the name Tannadice Street. The Tannadice name comes from the fact that the Clepington lands had belonged to Neish family of Tannadice and Clepington, who are also commemorated in the name of the adjacent Neish Street. 

In 1891, Johnstone Wanderers decided to enclose Clepington to enable them to charge for admission. In conjunction, it was decided to utilise the natural slope roughly a hundred yards to the west (below what is now Sandeman Street) in order to provide better views for spectators. As well as enclosing the new pitch, now situated on approximately its modern alignment, the club built a modest grandstand, a simple uncovered wooden structure with bench seating. It probably housed no more than 500 spectators.

In January 1894 Johnstone Wanderers merged with another local club, Strathmore, to form Dundee Wanderers. The new combination successfully applied for Scottish Football League membership and Clepington Park staged its first Scottish League fixture against Motherwell on 25 August 1894.

Wanderers struggled at national level, however, and were not re-elected at the end of the season, dropping down to the Northern League. From 1899, Wanderers had to contend with considerable competition for local support with the opening of Dens Park, the new Dundee F.C. ground. This was situated almost opposite Clepington, where the extended Tannadice Street met Sandeman Street at an angle. The two grounds are approximately 200 yards apart, which is the shortest distance between two senior football grounds in Britain. Only the grounds of two clubs in Budapest, MTK and BKV Elore, are closer together than Dens and Tannadice in the whole of Europe, as their grounds back onto each other.

===New owners (1909)===
1909 saw the formation of Dundee Hibernian, a new club representing the city&#x27;s Irish community, which had previously supported Dundee Harp. As much of the local Irish population was concentrated in the Lochee district, it was assumed the Hibs would seek to set up home in that area. However, rather than building a new ground from scratch, the new club&#x27;s secretary Pat Reilly took the controversial step of approaching the landlord of Clepington Park to secure a ready-made venue. The Hibs committee made an offer to the landlords which exceeded what Wanderers were paying; as a result, the established tenants were informed that their lease would not be renewed for the coming season.

The extent of Wanderers&#x27; anger at this development is evident from their decision to effectively dismantle Clepington&#x27;s fixtures and fittings. The grandstand, changing rooms, fencing and even the goalposts were removed, leaving Hibs with an open field rather than the ready-made ground they had envisaged. Nevertheless, the new club took over the lease, and a decision was taken to emphasise the new era by changing the name of the ground, Tannadice Park being adopted from the name of the street on which the ground&#x27;s main entrance would be situated.

Hibs&#x27; first priority was to re-equip Tannadice for the new season and a new grandstand and fencing were soon provided. A cricket-style pavilion housing dressing rooms was constructed in the south east corner of the ground, where the players&#x27; tunnel is today; this survived until 1961. An indication of the rapid development of the new Tannadice is contained in a report from the city&#x27;s &quot;Evening Telegraph&quot;, 21 July 1909:The pavilion is a splendid two-storey structure built of brick, containing two large dressing-rooms, two committee rooms, press box and referee’s room. The pavilion will be lit by electricity. The stand on the road side will be the whole length of the field and will seat about 1,000 people.

===Hibs and United (1909–1959)===
The club&#x27;s and the ground&#x27;s inaugural match was against Hibernian on 18 August 1909, in front of a crowd of 7,000. The original capacity of Tannadice Park was around 10,000, the terracings were specially extended and additional temporary seating erected for a Qualifying Cup-tie against Forfar Athletic in 1913; all of this was necessary to allow a record crowd to be accommodated, and the reported attendance was 15,000.

Dundee Hibs was renamed Dundee United in 1923, after a consortium had taken over the club and obtained re-election to the Scottish Football League.

No improvements to the ground were made until Dundee United won promotion to Division One for the first time in 1925. The Scottish League Management Committee informed the club that Tannadice would be subject to an inspection during the close season to ensure that it was up to the standard required for the higher level, and this clearly concentrated the directors&#x27; minds. Since 1909, Tannadice had been leased, but the board now decided to buy the ground, paying £2,500. Extensive renovations were then begun, the first to the pitch. There was a steep upwards slope towards the corner where the George Fox and East Stands now meet, and this necessitated solid rock being blasted to enable it to be levelled. There is still a slope of approximately 2 metres from north-west to south-east today. For the first time, proper terracings were constructed, while the pavilion was given a facelift and new turnstiles were built.

During the Second World War, United were forced to close down temporarily in 1940 due to there being no senior league operating in the area. As a result, an associated junior club, Dundee United Juniors, was formed to play at Tannadice. Although United returned to senior football in 1941, United Juniors continued to share the ground until they closed down in 1944.

The various financial crises which beset the club in the 1930s and its general lack of success on the pitch prevented any further ground improvements until 1953. At that time, the north terracing was concreted and four years later the same was done at both ends. During the close season of 1957, an important development took place with the construction of the Shed, which was opened in September of that year.

===The Kerr and McLean eras (1959–1992)===
The new Main Stand, opened in August 1962, was the first in Scotland to be constructed with a cantilever roof to provide column-free viewing for spectators. It was intended at the time that the whole ground would be re-built in a similar manner, but due to lack of finance no further building took place. This meant that the stand, which had a very tight spacing between the rows of seats, is an unusual L-shape around the south-eastern corner of the ground. The stand was also the first in Scotland to have a glass fronted lounge for the benefit of sponsors. This was opened in 1971 and overlooked the pitch, something that is now a common sight in football grounds across the country.

Much of the stadium&#x27;s development in the 1950s and 60s was funded by the introduction of &#x27;Taypools&#x27; a football pool run by a separate development club known as the &#x27;Dundee United Sportsmen&#x27;s Club&#x27; all profits of which went to the football club. The scheme was introduced in 1955 by directors Johnstone Grant and George Fox having seen a similar scheme in operation at Nottingham Forest

The stadium celebrated its centenary in 1983 - the year that Dundee United won their first and to date only league title. Under-soil heating was installed during the close season of 1985 at a reported cost of £100,000, United were the fourth Scottish club to have the facility, following Queen&#x27;s Park, Rangers and Hibernian. Unfortunately the first time the under-soil heating was called into action was when a fairly heavy snowfall started during the UEFA Cup 3rd round first leg tie against Neuchâtel Xamax on 27 November 1985 and the system failed.

1988 saw the covering of the small enclosure adjacent to the Main Stand. This was named the Fair Play enclosure as it was financed by a cash award made by UEFA following the sporting behaviour of United fans following the 1987 UEFA Cup Final 2nd leg. The funds were awarded to the club with a clear stipulation from UEFA that it should be used to improve spectator facilities.

===Modern Tannadice (1992–present)===
At the time of the Taylor Report on football ground safety, which was published in January 1990, Tannadice had a capacity of 22,310, but only 2,252 seats (all in the 1962 Main Stand). For a period in 1990, Dundee United considering sharing a new stadium with Dundee, but decided to redevelop Tannadice in 1991.

Many modifications were made at Tannadice in order to bring the stadium up to modern standards. Two new grandstands were constructed in the early nineties. The two tiered George Fox stand, was built in 1992 and is named after a former chairman of the club. The East Stand, a similar two tiered construction was built in 1994, and was renamed the Eddie Thompson stand in 2008. The latest stand to be constructed was the Fair Play stand in 1997. This stand form an extension to the Jerry Kerr stand along one side of the pitch, and now houses away fans on match day. Tangerine plastic seating was installed in the West Stand at the same time, with black seats spelling out &#x27;DUFC&#x27;. This development made Tannadice an all seater stadium. Several lesser modifications have taken place since the start of the 21st century, namely to allow participation in European competition. In 2009, the traditional flood lights were removed and replaced with a brighter roof mounted lighting system, and in 2010 the original wooden seats in the Jerry Kerr stand were removed and replaced with tangerine plastic seating.

The roof of the Jerry Kerr Stand was damaged in November 2021 by Storm Arwen, which forced the stand to be closed for a league match against Celtic.

==Stadium layout==

Tannadice is an all-seater stadium and has been so since 1994. The various stands are as follows:

The Jerry Kerr Stand: Originally built in 1962, it was the first cantilevered stand at a football ground in Scotland and only the third in the UK (after Sheffield Wednesday and Scunthorpe).

Particularly notable for its unusual L-shaped construction, the stand runs from the halfway line on the south (Tannadice Street) side of the pitch, bending around the ground&#x27;s south east corner, to end slightly along the east goal-line. The only seated accommodation at the ground prior to the post-Taylor Report redevelopment, it was known simply as the Main Stand until 2003, when it was renamed in honour of Jerry Kerr, the manager who had overseen its construction. The development of other parts of Tannadice has meant that this stand is now normally reserved for away supporters.

The Jim McLean Fair Play Stand: The most recent addition to the stadium, opened in 1997. Although separately named, it is effectively an extension of the old Main Stand to cover the entirety of the ground&#x27;s south side. The name derives from the Fair Play Enclosure, a small enclosed terrace which previously occupied this corner of Tannadice, and itself named for the award given to United and their fans by FIFA following the club&#x27;s run to the 1987 UEFA Cup Final. This stand is also reserved for visiting supporters. It was renamed after the club&#x27;s most successful manager Jim McLean in 2011.

The West Stand: Invariably referred to by its historic nickname, &quot;The Shed&quot;, it retains its original roof construction dating from 1957; between then and 1980, it was the only covered standing area at Tannadice, therefore becoming the most popular and atmospheric part of the ground. Since 1994, seats have been installed on the original terracing, parts of which are still visible at the corners. With season ticket holders now accommodated in the more modern parts of the stadium, the Shed can be allocated to either home or away supporters as demand dictates.

The George Fox Stand: Named after a long serving club director, this two-tier stand was built in 1991–92 along the north side of the ground and was the first phase in the conversion of Tannadice to meet all-seater requirements. It is allocated to home supporters.

The Eddie Thompson Stand: Opened in 1994 as the &quot;East Stand&quot;, and with a similar design to the adjacent George Fox Stand, it also has two tiers of seating. The East Stand now houses the loudest and most passionate elements of the United support, whereas George Fox patrons have the reputation of being somewhat more restrained in their behaviour. As such, this end of Tannadice is the spiritual heir of the old &quot;Shed&quot;. In March 2008, the stand was renamed after the then terminally ill club chairman, Eddie Thompson.

==Attendance records==
Official attendance figures are largely unavailable in Scottish football prior to the 1980s, other than for Scottish Cup ties, but the following figures as reported in the media give a guide to the progressive record attendance figures at Tannadice down the years.

Dundee Hibs&#x27; first match at Tannadice, a friendly against Hibernian of Edinburgh on 18 August 1909, was watched by a crowd of 7,000. This figure appears to be in excess of any crowd to watch a league fixture at the ground prior to the First World War. Cup ties tended to attract higher attendances in this era, and after the terraces were specially extended to accommodate the expected large crowd, 15,000 watched a Scottish Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar Athletic on 1 November 1913.

Promotion to the top flight in 1925 saw further ground improvements and two new records set, firstly when 20,000 were estimated to have watched Celtic&#x27;s visit on 19 September 1925. Then a much larger than anticipated crowd of 23,517 packed in to watch an important late season Tayside derby against St Johnstone on 17 April 1926, with both clubs fighting relegation.

The largest crowd to have watched a League fixture at Tannadice was 25,000 in the derby against Dundee on 3 January 1927. This remained the overall record until 23 February 1952, when 26,407 saw a Scottish Cup tie against Aberdeen, the all-time record for any domestic fixture on the ground. To date, the official record attendance at Tannadice remains the 28,000 who watched the club&#x27;s home European debut, an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup match against FC Barcelona on 16 November 1966. Since then, in common with many other grounds, safety legislation and conversion to all-seating has drastically reduced Tannadice&#x27;s capacity, with the modern stadium holding little over half that number.

==Other uses==
===Football===
Tannadice staged a B international match between Scotland and Turkey in December 2003.

===Greyhound racing===
Tannadice was the first venue in Dundee to stage greyhound racing when it came to the city in 1928. The first meeting took place on 18 May 1928. The track was independent (unlicensed) and meetings were held regularly on Saturdays and Wednesdays during the summer. Despite reasonable crowds the layout of the venue was not particularly suited to racing and it ended during the same year. Dens Park would become Dundee&#x27;s regular greyhound venue from 1932.

===Boxing===
On 1 January 1941, during a season when Dundee United were inactive due to the Second World War, a boxing match was staged at Tannadice. Local boxer Jim Brady defeated Kid Tanner of British Guiana to win the British Empire bantamweight title in front of 3,500 spectators.

<text>Joseph Gillain (), better known by his pen name Jijé (; 13 January 1914 – 19 June 1980), was a Belgian comics artist, best known for being a seminal artist on the &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; strip (and for having introduced the Fantasio character) and the creator of one of the first major European western strips, &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;.

==Biography==

Born Joseph Gillain in Gedinne, Namur, he completed various art studies (woodcraft, goldsmithing, drawing and painting) at the abbey of Maredsous. In 1936, he created his first comics character, &quot;Jojo&quot; in the catholic newspaper &quot;Le Croisé&quot;. &quot;Jojo&quot; was strongly inspired by &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, but Jijé gradually developed his own style. Soon a second series followed, &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot;, for the catholic youth magazine &quot;Petits Belges&quot;. Jijé also produced many illustrations for various Walloon magazines.

In 1939, he started to work for the new &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, where he would produce the largest part of his oeuvre and with whom he would remain associated with until the end of his life. Because the magazine could not receive foreign comic strip material during the war, as the main local artist, he drew most of the comics during that period. He took over the main series, &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;, from the Frenchman Rob-Vel: he added the sidekick Fantasio to the lone hero Spirou in order to add some comic relief in the series. He then created his own series, &quot;Jean Valhardi&quot;, and drew episodes of the American series published during the war, like &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;, when due to the war, the American pages could not reach the publisher.

His Catholic faith inspired biographies of Don Bosco and Christopher Columbus, as well as a gospel in comics form, &quot;Emmanuel&quot;. After the war, he handed over his existing series&#x27; to younger artists: André Franquin got &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;, Eddy Paape &quot;Jean Valhardi&quot; and Victor Hubinon &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot;. In the 1950s, he drew new adventures of &quot;Jean Valhardi&quot; and &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot;, while starting a new series, the western &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;. He also drew a biography of Baden-Powell. In the mid-1960s, he took over the artwork of &quot;Tanguy et Laverdure&quot; from Albert Uderzo and &quot;Redbeard&quot; from Victor Hubinon, both in &quot;Pilote&quot; magazine. He died at Versailles after a prolonged illness.

==Style and appreciation==
Jijé is one of the few European artists to have worked on both realistic and humorous features. After starting in a Hergé-like &quot;Ligne claire&quot; style, he went on to create his own distinctive style, the so-called &quot;Atom style&quot;. This style mixed elements of the Ligne Claire with Art Déco elements, and became one of the defining styles of the Franco-Belgian comics. He also had a few young cartoonists living with him in his studio in Waterloo, thus creating the so-called &quot;School of Marcinelle&quot;: this included André Franquin, Morris, and Will. Other famous artists working in the style and influence of the School of Marcinelle include Peyo, Jean Roba and Eddy Paape. Together with Franquin, Jijé is considered to be the father of the Atom style, which has had a revival since the 1980s with artists like Yves Chaland and Ever Meulen.

But Jijé was also the first master of the Franco-Belgian realistic comic, with &quot;Jerry Spring&quot;. Both his drawing style and his writing was very influential and groundbreaking. Later students of Jijé, not really working in the Atom style or the School of Marcinelle, include Jean Giraud (aka Moebius), Jean-Claude Mézières and Guy Mouminoux. Artist Jean Giraud started working in the style of Jijé before developing his own style.

He is held in high esteem by many of his peers, both those he tutored like Franquin and Moebius, and others. Tibet, author of &quot;Ric Hochet&quot; and &quot;Chick Bill&quot;, and for the major part of his career working for rival &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, has said that &quot;If Hergé is considered as God the Father, then Jijé undoubtedly is the Godfather&quot;.

In his writing, he can be seen as a transitional figure between the classic hero-driven comics like &quot;Alix&quot; or &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot;, and the modern anti-heroes like &quot;Blueberry&quot; or the works of Hermann Huppen. Jerry Spring still was the perfect, flawless hero, but the rest of the cast was no longer strictly divided into heroes, victims and villains, and no longer was the Native American the bloodthirsty figure he often was in earlier comics. A similar early anti-racist message was also given by &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot;, with a white and a black boy featured as equals.

He also pursued sculpting and painting, mainly for his private use or for family and friends. His illustrations for stories like &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (in the Belgian magazine &quot;Bonnes Soirées&quot; with René Follet) mix elements from his comic work and his paintings into one decorative style.

In 2004, the &quot;Maison de la Bande Dessinée&quot;, a comics museum in Brussels dedicated to his works was created, later expanding its focus to the work of Jijé as well as the creators he has influenced.

<doc id="847772" wikidata="Q809894" url="?curid=847772" title="Baseball glove">
<text>A baseball glove or mitt is a large glove worn by baseball players of 
the defending team, which assists players in catching and fielding balls hit by a batter or thrown by a teammate. Gloves are traditionally made of leather; but today other options exist, such as PVC and synthetic leather.

By convention, the glove is described by the handedness of the intended wearer, rather than the hand on which the glove is worn: a glove that fits on the left hand—used by a right-handed thrower—is called a &quot;right-handed&quot; (RH) or &quot;right-hand throw&quot; (RHT) glove. Conversely, a left-handed glove (LH or LHT) is worn on the right hand, allowing the player to throw the ball with the left hand.

==History==

Early baseball was a game played without gloves. During the gradual transition to gloves, a player who continued to play without one was called a &quot;barehanded catcher;&quot; this did not refer to the position of catcher, but rather to the practice of catching with bare hands. The earliest glove was not webbed and not particularly well suited for catching but was used more to swat a ball to the ground so that it could be picked up.
One of the first players believed to have used a baseball glove was Doug Allison, a catcher for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, in 1870, due to an injured left hand. The first confirmed glove use was by Charlie Waitt, a St. Louis outfielder and first baseman who, in 1875, donned a pair of flesh-colored gloves. Glove use slowly caught on as more and more players began using different forms of gloves.

Many early baseball gloves were simple leather gloves with the fingertips cut off, supposedly to allow for the same control of a bare hand but with extra padding. Pitcher, first baseman and outfielder Albert Spalding, originally skeptical of glove use, influenced more infielders to begin using gloves. Spalding later founded the sporting goods company Spalding, which still manufactures baseball gloves, along with other sports equipment. By the mid-1890s, it was normal for players to wear gloves in the field.

In the early 1900s baseball glove manufacturers started experimenting with a &quot;full web&quot; or &quot;web-pocketed&quot; gloves, gloves with a small 0.5&quot; ~ 1&quot; piece of leather connecting the thumb and index finger. Unlike current webbing, this was often made of a single piece of leather fully connected to both fingers of the glove, not with strips of leather connecting both sides of the glove as would be seen starting in the 1920s. John Snell attributes the decrease in errors over the course of the beginning of the 1900s in part to this change in glove design, and argues that &quot;This modification to the glove represented a fundamental change in the way the glove was perceived; it was no longer merely a piece of protective gear but rather a specialized tool for better fielding&quot;.

In , Bill Doak, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket. This design soon became the standard for baseball gloves. Doak patented his design and sold it to Rawlings. His design became the precursor to modern gloves and enabled Rawlings to become the preferred glove of professional players.

For many years, it was customary for fielders to leave their gloves on the field when their team went in to bat. This practice was prohibited by the major leagues in .

Baseball gloves have grown progressively larger since their inception. While catching in baseball had always been two-handed, gloves eventually grew to a size that made it easier to catch the ball in the webbing of the glove, using the off-hand to keep the ball from falling out. A glove is typically worn on the non-dominant hand, leaving the dominant hand for the more strenuous and precise task of throwing the ball; for example, a right-handed player would wear a glove on their left hand, which would still be referred to as a &quot;right handed glove&quot;.

The shape and size of the baseball glove are governed by official baseball rules. Section 3.00 - EQUIPMENT AND UNIFORMS specifies glove dimensions and materials in parts 3.04 through 3.07.

== Modern day ==
The structure and quality of the baseball glove have developed greatly over the past century. Today, the production of baseball gloves is much more precise and efficient. This has greatly increased the usefulness and accessibility of baseball gloves to the general population. Currently, Easton is &quot;experimenting with combining leather and Kevlar (used in bullet-proof vests) in a new ultra-lightweight glove line&quot;. Manufacturers have also designed new, non-traditional types of gloves to suit non-traditional players. Also, manufacturers are personalizing gloves for high-caliber players to help increase their exposure on national television.

Although there have been numerous advances in baseball glove design, the greatest arguably came with the advent of the catcher&#x27;s mitt. Yet despite state-of-the-art mitts being used by catchers, a Wake Forest University study of 39 U.S. minor-league players demonstrated that the mitts still do not offer enough protection from hand and wrist injuries.

The highest-quality baseball gloves are typically made of heavy leather. These heavy leather gloves usually take more time for the player to break in. They also provide a tighter, more personalized fit for the player. This is an improvement from youth and recreational gloves, which tend to feature palm pads and/or adjustable Velcro wrist straps. These gloves take less time to break in or are pre-broken in, are less personal and more &quot;one size fits all&quot;.

==Varieties==
Baseball gloves are measured by starting at the top of the index finger of the glove and measuring down the finger, along the inside of the pocket and then out to the heel of the glove. Gloves typically range in size from (youth starter size) to for adult outfield play. Catcher&#x27;s mitts, unlike those of other gloves, are measured around the circumference, and they typically have patterns.

The shape and size of a glove are described by its pattern. Modern gloves have become quite specialized, with position-specific patterns:
*Catcher&#x27;s mitts are called &quot;mitts&quot; because they lack individual fingers, like mittens. They have extra padding and a hinged, claw-like shape that helps them funnel fastballs into the pocket and provide a good target for pitchers. Some catchers use mitts with phosphorescent paint around the ridges to provide a clearer target for the pitcher. In addition, catcher&#x27;s mitts come in single hinge and dual-hinge varieties. If required to catch a knuckleball, a catcher will typically use an even larger mitt. Some knuckleball catchers have even experimented using first baseman&#x27;s mitts, as described below.
*First baseman&#x27;s mitts also lack individual fingers. They are generally very long and wide to help them pick or scoop badly thrown balls from infielders. These mitts usually have patterns, measured from wrist to the tip. Because first basemen are often left-handed, first basemen&#x27;s mitts are readily available to fit on the right hand. Hank Greenberg is often credited as the first to wear this style of the glove in the field. Some catchers, such as Victor Martinez, use a first base mitt while catching knuckleballers, though doing so comes with a disadvantage: because first basemen are rarely required to make a quick throw to another base, first base mitts tend to make the task of catching base stealers more difficult—a task already complicated by the knuckleball&#x27;s slow speed and erratic behavior.
*Infielders&#x27; gloves, unlike the first baseman&#x27;s mitt, tend to be smaller. They have shallow pockets to allow fielders to remove the ball easily in order to make a quick throw to a base. The webbing is often open to allow dirt to pass through the glove so that infielders do not pull out a handful of dirt when trying to remove the ball from the glove. Infielder&#x27;s gloves typically have patterns.
*Pitchers&#x27; gloves usually have a closed, opaque webbing to allow pitchers to conceal their grip on the ball (which, in part, determines the behavior of the pitch in flight) from the batter. Pitcher-specific gloves tend to have patterns; some pitchers such as Gio González use gloves with patterns as large as . Infield gloves with intricate webbing are also used by pitchers. Switch pitchers use a glove with six fingers.
*Outfielder&#x27;s gloves are usually quite long with deep pockets to help catch fly balls on the run or in a dive, and to keep outfielders from having to bend down as far to field a ground ball. These gloves typically have patterns, measured from wrist to the tip. They are frequently worn-in differently from those of infielders, with a flatter squeeze rather than the infielder&#x27;s rounded style.
*Left-hand throw gloves are any of the gloves above, but designed to be worn on the right hand (for left-handed players). Players that utilize the left-hand throw gloves such as Tony Gwynn or Sandy Koufax are most frequently pitchers, first basemen, or outfielders.
*Switch-thrower&#x27;s gloves are gloves with a second thumb pocket on the opposite side of the glove, to allow it to be worn on either side of the hand. At the major league level, this glove has been used only by switch-pitcher Pat Venditte.
*Sliding mitts were introduced in the 2010s as an evolution of earlier wrist guards that protect runners who slide onto base.

<doc id="847773" wikidata="Q6037921" url="?curid=847773" title="Inside the Beltway">
<text>&quot;Inside the Beltway&quot; is an American idiom used to characterize matters of greater interest to U.S. federal government officials, contractors, lobbyists, and media personnel, than to their general public. The Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) is a highway that has encircled Washington, D.C. since 1964. Some speakers of American English now use &quot;beltway&quot; as a metonym for federal government insiders (cf. Beltway bandits). Multiple political columns are titled after the phrase, including the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, American University&#x27;s magazine, and columnist John McCaslin.

Geographically, &quot;Inside the Beltway&quot; describes Washington, D.C., and those sections of Maryland and Virginia that lie within the perimeter of the Capital Beltway.

==Usage==
Reporting in 1975 on the prospect of a reexamination of the Warren Commission&#x27;s findings concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, newspaper journalist Nicholas M. Horrock wrote:

==Communities==
The following cities and counties are located entirely or partially inside the Beltway:
*Washington, D.C. (all DC land is inside the Beltway; a small portion of the Potomac River that is part of DC is outside the Beltway)
*Alexandria, Virginia (almost entirely)
*Arlington County, Virginia (entirely)
*Fairfax County, Virginia (partially)
*Falls Church, Virginia (entirely)
*Montgomery County, Maryland (partially)
*Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland (partially)

<doc id="847776" wikidata="Q615561" url="?curid=847776" title="Dens Park">
<text>Dens Park, officially known as Scot Foam Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium in Dundee, Scotland, which is the home of club Dundee F.C. and has a capacity of . Tannadice Park, the home of rivals Dundee United, is just 200 yards (183 metres) away.

==History==
Dundee moved to &quot;Dens&quot; from their first stadium at Carolina Port in 1899. Dens Park hosted three full international matches involving the Scotland men&#x27;s team, in March 1904, March 1908, and December 1936. All three games were Home Internationals against Wales. The record attendance at Dens Park is 43,024, which was set in 1953 when Dundee played host to Rangers in the Scottish Cup.
Following Dundee&#x27;s promotion to the newly-founded Scottish Premier League in 1998, Dens Park had to be redeveloped to meet SPL seating capacity rules. Existing concrete terraces on the eastern and western ends of the ground were removed and two 3,000-seat stands were built in a record time of 82 days for the start of the 1998–99 season. The near-identical single-tier stands were named to honour Bobby Cox and Bob Shankly; the former usually houses home supporters while the latter houses the away fans. A new club shop and ticket office were also built. Undersoil heating was installed in 2005. Dens Park was named best pitch in the First Division in 2008.

Dens Park has also hosted Scottish League Cup finals, in 1979–80 and 1980–81, and the Scottish Challenge Cup final in 2007–08. Also in 2007, Dens Park (along with McDiarmid Park in Perth) hosted European Under-19 elite round qualifying games between Scotland, Portugal, Turkey and Georgia.

The ground hosted its first Scotland women match in July 2023, a friendly against Northern Ireland.

==Potential development / relocation==
In 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland&#x27;s bid to host UEFA Euro 2008. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Park respectively. The stadium was planned for construction on a new site at Caird Park in the north-east of the city. Scotland was not successful in their bid, however, and so these plans were postponed, but could have been resurrected had Scotland launched a successful bid for another tournament in that period. Both clubs strongly oppose a ground-sharing agreement but were interested in a new arrangement that would have taken place if Ukraine and Poland had failed to meet UEFA&#x27;s expectations for hosting UEFA Euro 2012.

In May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett. In October 2014, Dundee Supporter&#x27;s Society announced they have put forward plans to then club chairman Bill Colvin which may allow the club to buy back the stadium from Bennett. They also expressed, this was not a plan to enable the Supporter&#x27;s Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, they said they will &quot;simply administer the scheme&quot;. In April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings. Dundee FC completed the purchase of the stadium from John Bennett in October 2023.

In August 2016, club owners John Nelms and Tim Keyes were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area on the north-western periphery of the city, next to the Dundee Ice Arena. It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being &quot;early doors&quot; in a video interview published on the club&#x27;s website. Documents related to the proposed new stadium were submitted in August 2017, ahead of a formal planning application.

In June 2022, Dundee moved their day-to-day operations away from Dens Park and into Dundee and Angus College&#x27;s Gardyne Campus located in the south-east of the city with the intent to improve the sports facilities there, although revised plans for the Camperdown stadium were released both around the same time and at the end of 2023.

===Greyhound racing===

In 1932 Dundee FC agreed a lease with the Dundee Greyhound Racing Company Ltd for a period of ten years for a nominal capital of £25,000. The first night of greyhound racing took place on 9 November 1932 with grass having replaced the existing cinder running track and the main grandstand was fitted out with a glass front to allow patrons the ability to watch racing in all weathers. This new facility also contained a refreshment counter and a totalisator booth. A large totalisator board was erected on the Dens Road side of the ground.

John Jolliffe a private trainer moved to Scotland in 1932 and took over as General and Racing Manager at Dens Park for a period of three years before moving onto the larger Holburn Stadium in Aberdeen in 1935. He introduced selling races at the track and the racing took place under National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) rules. Distances raced over were 260, 450, 460 and 650 yards. Greyhound racing ended at the end of
May 1936 due to the liabilities of the company resulting in a winding up order. In 1937 an attempt to start racing nearby at the East Craigie F.C. ground failed due to local protests.

The second period of racing came over fifty years later in 1992 when Ron Dixon arrived at the football club. The Canadian businessman owned a company called Dundee Leisure and was the new chairman of the football club. He secured planning permission for a greyhound track and new car parking facilities with further plans to build a new stand, a conference centre and an ice rink on site. The 400-metre circumference sand greyhound track was constructed and a Bramwich Hare was installed in addition to a Datatote totalisator system. Racing started on 21 October 1994 under the management of Eddie Ramsay but Dixon&#x27;s vision never materialised with the greyhound racing ending on 11 December 1996; the ground was soon redeveloped with its new stands positioned parallel to the football pitch, ending the curved design.

<doc id="847781" wikidata="Q1929410" url="?curid=847781" title="Toronto Blessing">
<text>The Toronto Blessing, a term coined by British newspapers, refers to the Christian revival and associated phenomena that began in January 1994 at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church (TAV), which was renamed in 1996 to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship (TACF) and then later in 2010 renamed to Catch the Fire Toronto. It is categorized as a neo-charismatic Evangelical Christian church and is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The revival impacted charismatic Christian culture through an increase in popularity and international reach and intensified criticism and denominational disputes. Criticism primarily centered around disagreements about charismatic doctrine, the Latter Rain Movement, and whether or not the physical manifestations people experienced were in line with biblical doctrine or were actually heretical practices.

The Toronto Blessing is also reported as having influenced the Brownsville Revival (1995 – ) and the Lakeland Revival (2008) that occurred later in Florida, and which included similar styles of worship, ministry and reputed supernatural manifestations.

==Characteristics==

The Toronto Blessing has become synonymous within charismatic Christian circles for terms and actions that include an increased awareness of God&#x27;s love, religious ecstasy, external observances of ecstatic worship, being slain in the Spirit, uncontrollable laughter, emotional and/or physical euphoria, crying, healing from emotional wounds, healing of damaged relationships, and electric waves of the spirit. &quot;Holy laughter&quot;, as a result of overwhelming joy, was a hallmark manifestation, and there were also some reports of instances of participants roaring like lions or making other animal noises. Leaders and participants present in these services claim that most of these manifestations, including some people roaring like lions, were physical manifestations of the Holy Spirit&#x27;s presence and power, while some Pentecostal and charismatic leaders believe these were the counterfeits of the Spirit as is mentioned in the biblical passage of 2 Thessalonians 2:9. In December, 1994, Toronto Life Magazine declared TAV as Toronto&#x27;s most notable tourist attraction for the year.

The events that occurred at the Toronto Blessing are not unique in Christian history; similar events were recorded as happening within the Azusa Street revival of the early 1900s as well as in other revival movements throughout the history of Christian church movements. The Bible also records supernatural events when people encountered God and describes lightning coming from the top of Mount Sinai in Exodus 20:18 when the 10 Commandments were given, Jewish soldiers and temple police falling down in the Garden of Gethsemane when encountering Jesus in John 18:6, Moses&#x27; face shining when descending Mount Sinai in Exodus 34:35, and a cloud of glory that appeared over the Hebrew tent of meeting in Exodus 40:34. Proponents of the Toronto Blessing point to these biblical examples as partial evidence of the activities in their meetings being legitimate.

The primary speaker at these meetings for the first few months was Randy Clark, a former Baptist pastor who left his denomination and joined the Association of Vineyard Churches after a team from the Vineyard denomination ministered in his church in 1984. Clark testified to being miraculously healed after a bad car accident while a teenager many years earlier. This event made him believe in supernatural healing, even though at the time he was part of a denomination that believed the gifts of the Spirit were no longer part of the way God operates in the lives of Christians.

===Miracles and manifestations===

A common element described by those in attendance at the meetings was the claim of miraculous events that occurred during the services. Some of these could be categorized as physical healings, while in other instances, people reported they had a new awareness of God&#x27;s love, a new freedom from past fears, anger, and relationship problems. There were even claims of God putting gold fillings into people&#x27;s teeth during the service. Some of the more common claims include the following:

* More than 300 of the visitors claimed that they supernaturally received gold or silver fillings in their teeth during the meetings.
* A study was conducted in 1995 that surveyed 1,000 people who visited TAV and approximately half of them reported that they felt spiritually refreshed after the meetings, close to 90% said they were &quot;more in love with Jesus&quot; than they had been in any other point in their lives, and 88% of married respondents stated that they were also more in love with their spouse. A follow-up study conducted in 1997 also yielded similar figures from the original survey respondents.

===Similarities to other revival movements===
The Toronto Blessing appears to share similarities with other past events where historical records report similar activities of laughter, crying, falling down, shaking and claims of miraculous healings. According to some, these events have been recorded as occurring throughout, not only the recent past, but for the approximate 2,000 years since the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ took place.

Some of the events in the past few hundred years that bear these similarities include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Lakeland Revival
* Brownsville Revival
* Holiness Pentecostal Revivals in 1875-1907
* Welsh Revival
* Jotebeche Methodist Church Revival
* Azusa Street Revival
* Cane Ridge Revival
* Second Great Awakening led by Charles Finney

==Reaction and criticism==
Some Christian leaders were enthusiastic about what they saw as a renewal in North American Christianity, while others saw it as heretical and spiritually dangerous. The laughter portion of these meetings was endorsed by Benny Hinn, Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson, who said in one interview that &quot;The Bible says in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy.&quot;

Critics referred to it as self-centered and evil and claimed that the strange manifestations were warning signs for other Christian believers to stay away. Others defended the blessing as historically rooted in earlier revivals, such as those seen by pastor and theologian Jonathan Edwards, and as having positive effects in the lives of participants.

In his book, &quot;Counterfeit Revival&quot;, Hank Hanegraaff claimed that the revival has done more damage than good and that the Toronto blessing was a matter of people being enslaved into altered states of consciousness where they obscure reality and enshrine absurdity. Hank Hanegraaff also stated in a 1996 Washington Post interview that, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to feel all these things, but the fact is, these feelings will wear off, and then disappointment steps in. I call it post-Holy Laughter depression syndrome.&quot;

At the time of the renewal, B. J. Oropeza, then a researcher for the Christian Research Institute, compared phenomena from the Toronto meetings with phenomena from previous Western revivals. He concluded that while authentic signs of revival might be present at such meetings, ministerial leaders have a biblical responsibility to ensure that parishioners maintain orderly conduct at the gatherings and this seemed to be lacking at many of the meetings.

James Beverley, a critic of the Toronto Blessing and a professor at Toronto-based Tyndale Seminary, stated that these events were a &quot;mixed blessing&quot;, but was later quoted in 2014 as saying, &quot;whatever the weaknesses are, they are more than compensated for by thousands and thousands of people having had tremendous encounters with God, receiving inner healings, and being renewed.&quot; He also stated, &quot;My concerns have changed a bit. I regret saying that they did not give enough attention to Jesus. I think that was too hard. The leaders and the people, they love Jesus. We all do not give enough attention to Jesus.&quot;

It is also important to note that other Vineyard churches, such as Harvest Rock in Pasadena, California experienced the same manifestations as those that occurred at TAV around the same time as the events of 1994.

==Timeline of immediate and subsequently impacted events==

1994: The Toronto Blessing began at the Toronto Airport Vineyard church, when pastors John and Carol Arnott were reportedly inspired by revivals in South Africa as well as those in Argentina that were led by Claudio Freidzon. They invited Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor from St. Louis, Missouri, to minister at the church from January 20–23, 1994. Randy Clark had been influenced by his own personal life experiences of miracles happening in the church he pastored, as well as the ministry of Rodney Howard-Browne, a South African preacher, and founder of the Rodney Howard-Browne Evangelistic Association in Louisville, Kentucky. Clark preached at TAV church over the course of 60 days, starting January 20, and the meetings continued for 6 days each week for the next 12 1/2 years. He spent 42 of those first 60 days in Canada with a few in-between trips back home to see his family.

In that first revival service, there were about 120 people in attendance, and Arnott stated that most members fell on the floor &quot;laughing, rolling, and carrying on&quot;. During that first year, the church&#x27;s regular attendance size reportedly tripled to 1,000 members, and meetings were held every night except on Mondays, as the revival&#x27;s influence continued to spread. Reports of similar revivals emerged from Atlanta, Anaheim, and St. Louis in the United States, and from Cambodia, and Albania. It became common for visitors to carry the influence of the revival back to their home congregations where the revival would then continue within their own churches; two notable British cases in point were Holy Trinity, Brompton and Holy Trinity, Cheltenham. Other worldwide locations that became known for a Toronto Blessing style of revival include Pensacola, Florida, home of the Brownsville Revival, Bath, England, Cagayan de Oro, Philippines, and Abilene, Texas. A few months later, in May 1994, Eleanor Mumford, the wife of a Vineyard pastor who herself had attended the services at TAV, traveled to Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) in London, England where, after sharing her testimony, manifestations and activities similar to those that occurred at TAV began to also occur at HTB. It was also recorded that members of the Newfrontiers group of churches visited Toronto, and upon their return home, revival began breaking out in their churches.

1995: &quot;Charisma Magazine&quot; reported that an estimated 4,000 churches in England and another 7,000 churches in North America had been impacted by this new revival movement. During this same year, Steve Hill, an Assemblies of God evangelist, who was recorded as being powerfully impacted when he attended Holy Trinity Brompton, was asked to preach at the Brownsville Assembly of God church in Pensacola, Florida. A handful of staff members of this church had also been to the services in Toronto, and had been praying for revival for several years. The Brownsville Revival started on Father&#x27;s Day, and as a result, reportedly led to almost a quarter of a million people being converted to Christianity.

2000: &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that 250,000 agnostics in the United Kingdom turned to a belief in Jesus through Nicky Gumbel&#x27;s Alpha course.&quot; Nicky Gumbel was also later recorded as being in attendance at some of the Toronto Blessing meetings.

2014: 20-year anniversary conference - A special conference was held at Catch the Fire in January 2014 to commemorate the 20-year anniversary of the original Toronto Blessing. Attendees stated that apologies and forgiveness were offered during this conference that brought about a closing of the rift that formed between the Vineyard and TAV during the earlier times of the movement.

Continual Services - Regular services continue to be held at Catch the Fire, and attendees continue to travel from around the world to visit the church.

The peak of the Toronto Blessing&#x27;s prominence in the Christian community occurred in the mid- to late-1990s. Since that time it has faded from public view, although the proponents of Discernment Ministries have suggested that these kinds of events are simply part of a wider theological cycle that has existed continually throughout modern era charismatic Movements. Manifestations of the kind associated with the Toronto Blessing were also recorded in Colin Urquhart&#x27;s earlier book, &quot;When The Spirit Comes,&quot; which appeared during the 1970s and chronicled the renewals which occurred at the church in Luton, England where Urquhart was, for a time, incumbent. The phenomena associated with the charismatic renewal have been championed by such clergy as Urquhart and David Watson in Britain, as well as by countless preachers worldwide, but have also been criticized as dehumanizing and as being rooted in extreme aesthetic reactions to religious stimuli.

==Impact on Christian culture==
The events that started in 1994 spurred many Christians hungry for deeper encounters with God to visit the church in Toronto, or attend other events around the world that were also influenced by what occurred during the Toronto Blessing. Several highly successful missionaries, pastors, and itinerant ministers today attribute the growth of their organizations and their increased hunger for more of God&#x27;s presence to the Toronto Blessing. These include Bill Johnson, Senior Pastor of Bethel Church in Redding, California, Heidi and Rolland Baker, Missionaries to Mozambique, Africa, and Che Ahn, Senior Pastor of Harvest Rock Church in Pasadena, California. Each of these leaders has also had a major impact on the 21st Century Charismatic Movement through regular conferences and revival meetings, including Azusa Now, Jesus Culture Conferences, The Call and The Send.

=== Positive impact ===
Many different ministers traveled to TAV, and later, Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship (TACF) to experience for themselves what was happening during the Toronto Blessing meetings, as well as in the years to follow. These ministers have stated in various books and public teachings that they were present in the meetings, had differing positive encounters, and reported the fruit of those encounters:

Harvest International Ministries (HIM): started nightly meetings after their pastor, Che Ahn, attended services at TAV. These meetings lasted for three years and, since that time, HIM has planted thousands of churches in over 60 nations.
IRIS Global: Heidi Baker, after attending the meetings in Toronto, went back to Mozambique, and in the years since, along with her husband, Rolland Baker, has planted more than 10,000 churches throughout Africa and Asia. Their organization, Iris Global, also provides food for 10,000 children each day, operates three primary schools, and five Bible schools; all of this success is attributed to what started in Toronto.

Bethel Church: One year after Bill Johnson, a pastor in Weaverville, California, visited TAV, he took over as the senior pastor of Bethel Church in Redding, California. Bethel has become known as a place of supernatural healing, impartation, and ministry training as a result of what occurred in Toronto.

Nicky Gumbel: Gumbel was the curate of Holy Trinity Brompton at the time of the Toronto Blessing and was later the vicar of the church, the biggest Anglican church in the United Kingdom. He has been quoted as saying that the Toronto Blessing was &quot;the kick start that the Alpha course needed&quot;.

=== Negative impact ===

Alleged origins from outside of the Christian tradition - Andrew Strom claims that the spiritual phenomena witnessed during the Toronto Blessing were a result of what is known in the Hindu kundalini yoga tradition as &quot;shaktipat&quot; and &quot;kundalini awakening&quot;. He makes these claims in reference to phenomena that occurred during the Toronto Blessing such as shaking, jerking, and writhing on the floor.

The claims of Strom have been directly disputed in a formal response by Randy Clark as well as in a book written by John Arnott with his explanation of the disputed events. Phenomena associated with &quot;kundalini awakening&quot; and the practice of shaktipat have appeared by those within the Toronto Blessing Movement to be similar to phenomena and/or spiritual practices mentioned in various &quot;New Testament&quot; texts, such as Acts 2:1-13, albeit under different names, in different terms, or with different purposes. For example, based on the testimony and specific evidence provided in &quot;Acts&quot; 2:1-13, what the Hindu spiritual traditions refer to as a &quot;kundalini awakening&quot; have been considered to carry a similarity to what occurred to Jesus&#x27; 12 Apostles - en masse - during the original Pentecost event. The Apostles&#x27; &quot;baptism of the Holy Spirit&quot; during Pentecost was accompanied by manifestations of &quot;tongues of fire&quot; and of speaking in other languages, which some present could understand, but others considered to be babbling in drunkenness. The accusation of drunkenness has been interpreted by practitioners of the Toronto Blessing to be actual drunken behavior. They believe that Andrew Strom has mistakenly confused manifestations within their movement to manifestations that occur within the New Age practice of Kundalini awakening. There continues to be a debate around whether or not such manifestations reflect what occurred within the biblical text of Acts 2:1-13.

Theological disagreement and reputation - Some organizations and writers have painted the Toronto Blessing in a negative light which has created a negative stigma or reputation regarding charismatic style services among other Christian denominations. Other theologians singled out TAV, and its associated leaders, John and Caroll Arnott, as part of a bigger criticism of the Charismatic Movement, arguing from the position that the gifts of the Spirit have ceased. One major voice in this dissent was John F. MacArthur who, in October 2013, led the &quot;Strange Fire&quot; Conference which was aimed at exposing excesses and doctrinal errors in the charismatic Christian movement. Pastor Alan Morrison is also quoted as referring to the Toronto Blessing as the &quot;Toronto delusion&quot; and a &quot;plague on the land.&quot;

Denominational splits - In December 1995, the Toronto Airport Vineyard church was released from affiliation with the Vineyard movement. The reasons for the disaffiliation were for growing tension over the church&#x27;s emphasis on extraordinary manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the methods used to logistically manage the ministry time during the services, a concern about leaders not abiding by established Association of Vineyard Churches guidelines, and the Vineyard leadership&#x27;s inability to exercise oversight over the revival.
Early in 1996, the leadership of TAV decided to rename the church to Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. Randy Clark later stated that he was &quot;grieved by the decision of the Vineyard&#x27;s leadership&quot; regarding this matter. Bethel Church, located in Redding, California, and other organizations also later detached themselves from the Assemblies of God to support their own spiritual practices and movements that had occurred during the revival meetings.

<text>Edward Sylvester Morse (June 18, 1838 – December 20, 1925) was an American zoologist, archaeologist, and orientalist. He is considered the &quot;Father of Japanese archaeology.&quot;

==Early life==
Morse was born in Portland, Maine to Jonathan Kimball Morse and Jane Seymour (Becket) Morse. His father was a Congregationalist deacon who held strict Calvinist beliefs. His mother, who did not share her husband&#x27;s religious beliefs, encouraged her son&#x27;s interest in the sciences. An unruly student, Morse was expelled from all but one of the schools he attended in his youth — the Portland village school, the academy at Conway, New Hampshire, in 1851, and Bridgton Academy in 1854 (for carving on desks). He also attended Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine. At Gould Academy, Morse came under the influence of Dr. Nathaniel True who encouraged Morse to pursue his interest in the study of nature.

He preferred to explore the Atlantic coast in search of shells and snails, or go to the field to study the fauna and flora. By the age of thirteen he had put together an impressive collection of shells. Despite his lack of formal education, his collections soon earned him the visit of eminent scientists from Boston, Washington and even the United Kingdom. He was noted for his work with land snails, and discovered two new species: &quot;Helix asteriscus&quot;, now known as &quot;Planogyra asteriscus&quot;, and &quot;H. Milium&quot;, now known as &quot;Striatura milium&quot;. These species were presented at meetings of the Boston Society of Natural History in 1857 and 1859.
He was a gifted draughtsman, a skill that served him well throughout his career. As a young man, it enabled him to be employed as a mechanical draughtsman at the Portland Locomotive Company and later preparing wood engravings for natural history publications. This relatively well-paid work enabled him to save enough money to support his further education. Morse was recommended by Philip Pearsall Carpenter to Louis Agassiz (1807–1873) at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University for his intellectual qualities and talent at drawing. After completing his studies he served as Agassiz&#x27;s assistant in charge of conservation, documentation and drawing collections of mollusks and brachiopods until 1862. He became especially interested in brachiopods during this time, and his first paper on the topic was published in 1862.

During the American Civil War, Morse attempted to enlist in the 25th Maine Infantry, but was turned down due to a chronic tonsil infection. On June 18, 1863, Morse married Ellen (“Nellie”) Elizabeth Owen in Portland. The couple had two children, Edith Owen Morse and John Gould Morse (named after Morse&#x27;s lifelong friend Major John Mead Gould).

==Career==

Morse rapidly became successful in the field of zoology, specializing in malacology or the study of molluscs. In 1864, he published his first work devoted to molluscs under the title &quot;Observations On The Terrestrial Pulmonifera of Maine&quot;. Morse had been elected to the position of curator of the Portland Natural History Society, a position he hoped would become permanent. But in 1866 the Great Fire destroyed the buildings of the Society, along with much of Portland, and also the chance of a salaried position. An alternative opportunity arose with the foundation of the Peabody Academy of Science in Salem. Morse returned to Massachusetts to work at the academy, along with Caleb Cooke, Alpheus Hyatt, Alpheus Spring Packard and Frederic Ward Putnam (director), all former students of Agassiz.
In 1867, along with Putnam, Hyatt and Packard, Morse co-founded the scientific journal &quot;The American Naturalist&quot;, and Morse became one of its editors. The establishment of the Journal was very important for American Natural History. It was written by experts in the field, but aimed to be accessible to a wide readership. This aim was greatly helped by the high quality of the illustrations, many of them provided by Morse himself. Morse&#x27;s desire to bring natural history to a wider audience also led him to give lectures to a variety of audiences. His combination of broad knowledge, speaking skill, and ability to draw quickly on the blackboard with both hands made him a popular presenter.

Morse continued his work on brachiopods, often considered to be his most important scientific work. In 1869, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Between 1869 and 1873 he published a series of papers on the embryology and classification of the group. Whereas in 1865 he had accepted the majority view that placed brachiopoda within the molluscs, in 1870 largely on the basis of embryological observations, he proposed that the brachiopoda should be removed from the molluscs, and placed within the annelids, a group of segmented worms. Modern taxonomy agrees with the first of these propositions, but not the second, classifying molluscs, brachiopods and annelids as three separate phyla within the superphylum Lophotrochozoa. Helen Muir-Wood has given an account of the history of the classification of the brachiopods that places Morse&#x27;s work in its historical context.

From 1871 to 1874, Morse was appointed to the chair of comparative anatomy and zoology at Bowdoin College. In 1873 and 1874 he was a teacher at the summer school established by Agassiz on Penikese Island. Though the school only operated for a few years, several of its students went on to distinguished careers, including David Starr Jordan. In 1874, he became a lecturer at Harvard University. In 1876, Morse was named a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1877, he provided the illustrations for a book by his friend John Mead Gould, entitled &quot;How to camp out&quot;.

During this period the issue of evolution caused much discussion and controversy. Agassiz was an opponent of evolution. He argued that the persistence of animals such as &quot;Lingula&quot; (a brachiopod) over immense periods of time, from the Silurian to the present day, with little change was &quot;a fatal objection to the theory of gradual development&quot;. However all of his students subsequently adopted evolutionary theory in various forms. A clear statement of Morse&#x27;s position on evolution is found in his address, as vice-president (Natural History) of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at its Buffalo NY meeting in August 1876 (reprinted under the title of &quot;What American Zoologists have done for Evolution&quot;) He adopts a clear selectionist position, in contrast, for example, to Hyatt, who was a neo-Lamarckian. He addresses the issue of human origins, and finds the evidence for &quot;the lowly origin of man&quot;, and common ancestry with apes, convincing. He did not only express these views in a western context, but was subsequently the first to bring Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution to Japan.

===Japan===
In June 1877 Morse first visited Japan in search of coastal brachiopods. His visit turned into a three-year stay when he was offered a post as the first professor of zoology at the Tokyo Imperial University. He went on to recommend several fellow Americans as &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot; (foreign advisors) to support the modernization of Japan in the Meiji Era. To collect specimens, he established a marine biological laboratory at Enoshima in Kanagawa Prefecture.

While looking out of a window on a train between Yokohama and Tokyo, Morse discovered the Ōmori shell mound, the excavation of which opened the study in archaeology and anthropology in Japan and shed much light on the material culture of prehistoric Japan. He returned to Japan in 1882–3 to present a report of his findings to Tokyo Imperial University.

Morse had much interest in Japanese ceramics, making a collection of over 5,000 pieces of Japanese pottery. On his 1882-3 visit to Japan he collected clay samples as well as finished ceramics. He devised the term &quot;cord-marked&quot; for the sherds of Stone Age pottery, decorated by impressing cords into the wet clay. The Japanese translation, &quot;Jōmon,&quot; now gives its name to the whole Jōmon period as well as Jōmon pottery. He brought back to Boston a collection amassed by government minister and amateur art collector Ōkuma Shigenobu, who donated it to Morse in recognition of his services to Japan. These now form part of the &quot;Morse Collection&quot; of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The catalogue is a monumental work, and still the only major work of its kind in English. His collection of daily artifacts of the Japanese people is kept at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. The remainder of the collection was inherited by his granddaughter, Catharine Robb Whyte via her mother Edith Morse Robb and is housed at the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, Banff, Alberta, Canada.

He travelled several times to the Far East which inspired several books, with his own illustrations. &quot;Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings&quot; was published in 1885; &quot;On the Older Forms of Terra-cotta Roofing Tiles&quot; in 1892; &quot;Latrines of the East&quot; in 1893; &quot;Glimpses of China and Chinese Homes&quot; in 1903; and &quot;Japan Day by Day&quot; in 1917.
===Massachusetts===

After leaving Japan, Morse traveled to Southeast Asia and Europe. In subsequent years, he returned to Europe, and Japan in quest of pottery.

In 1886 Morse became president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He became Keeper of Pottery at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1890. He was also a director of the Peabody Academy of Science (now part of and succeeded by the Peabody Essex Museum) in Salem from 1880 to 1914. In 1898, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (3rd class) by the Japanese government. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1898. He became chairman of the Boston Museum in 1914, and chairman of the Peabody Museum in 1915. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures (2nd class) by the Japanese government in 1922.

Morse was a friend of astronomer Percival Lowell, who inspired interest in the planet Mars. Morse would occasionally journey to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, during optimal viewing times to observe the planet. In 1906, Morse published &quot;Mars and Its Mystery&quot; in defense of Lowell&#x27;s controversial speculations regarding the possibility of life on Mars.

He donated over 10,000 books from his personal collection to the Tokyo Imperial University. On learning that the library of the Tokyo Imperial University was reduced to ashes by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, in his will he ordered that his entire remaining collection of books be donated to Tokyo Imperial University.

Morse&#x27;s last paper, on shell-mounds, was published in 1925. He died at his home in Salem, Massachusetts in December of that year, of cerebral hemorrhage. He was buried at the Harmony Grove Cemetery.

==Morse&#x27;s Law==
In 1872, Morse noticed that mammals and reptiles with reduced fingers lose them from the sides in a particular order, beginning with the thumb and then the little finger. Later researchers revealed that this is a general pattern in tetrapods (except Theropoda and Urodela): digits are reduced in the order I → V → II → III → IV, the reverse order of their appearance in embryogenesis. This trend is known as Morse&#x27;s Law.

<doc id="847788" wikidata="Q2712704" url="?curid=847788" title="Pussy Galore (band)">
<text>Pussy Galore was an American garage rock band formed by students at Brown University in 1984. They had a constantly fluid line-up until their demise in 1990, with vocalist-guitarist Jon Spencer as the sole member through the band&#x27;s history. They took their name from the character in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, and their sound was an irreverent experimental blues rock influenced by The Rolling Stones and Einstürzende Neubauten.

==History==
The band&#x27;s earliest incarnation consisted of guitarist and vocalist Jon Spencer, guitarist and occasional vocalist Julia Cafritz and drummer John Hammill, though this line-up both changed and expanded in later years. Spencer and Cafritz were both students at Ivy League college Brown when the band formed in 1984. Following the self-released 7&quot; &quot;Feel Good About Your Body&quot;, they added guitarist Neil Hagerty. The new line-up recorded the EP &quot;Groovy Hate Fuck&quot;. This EP, like all of their early releases, would be self-released on their own Shove Records label. After the band moved to New York City after graduation from Brown, they further expanded the line-up by taking on then 16-year-old Cristina Martinez as a guitarist. Martinez was not a musician and had simply taken the photograph for the 7&quot;. The band also replaced Hammill with former Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert. Then, on a dare from Sonic Youth, they released a limited-edition cassette cover album of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St&quot;. They followed this up in January 1987 with another self-released mini-set, &quot;Pussy Gold 5000&quot;. Shortly after this, Martinez left the band and formed Boss Hog with Spencer a few years later.

In September 1987, Pussy Galore recorded their debut album and their first recording for another label, &quot;Right Now!&quot;, on Caroline Records. Shortly following the release of &quot;Right Now!&quot;, Hagerty left the band and was replaced by Kurt Wolf, but he was to return to the Pussy Galore line-up following the release of the &quot;Sugarshit Sharp&quot; EP with Wolf leaving to join Loudspeaker. &quot;Sugarshit Sharp&quot; is probably best known for the garage rock interpretation of Einstürzende Neubauten&#x27;s industrial/dance classic from the mid-1980s &quot;Yu-Gung&quot;. Pussy Galore used sampling in their music, drawing short samples from both the original track and the Public Enemy rap classic &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe The Hype&quot;. F.M. Einheit, a member of Neubauten, was said to have been quite impressed with the cover version. The EP also introduced Pussy Galore&#x27;s new logo, which consisted of Neubauten&#x27;s &quot;Yu-Gung Man&quot; emblem with a grainy, almost indecipherable photocopy of the Rolling Stones&#x27; trademark lips-and-tongue image superimposed over its head.

Their second full-length set, &quot;Dial &#x27;M&#x27; for Motherfucker&quot;, was released in 1989 and continued their formula of nihilistic guitar noise and punk rock provocation, with additional studio trickery filling out the material. Originally intended to be titled &quot;Make Them All Eat Shit Slowly&quot;, the name of the album was ultimately vetoed by Caroline Records. The album is sometimes wrongly referred to as &quot;New Album By Pussy Galore&quot;. This is largely due to the fact that the cover of the album has no text except for a sticker that appeared on the plastic shrink wrapping that bears those words. &quot;Dial M&quot; represents a move away from a simple noise formula to something more experimental. It is, for example, difficult to determine where some songs begin and end. Many sequences on the album appear to run in reverse, sometimes mid-song, seemingly for no apparent reason. Cafritz appears on some of this album but not the entirety. &quot;Dial M&quot; marks a point at which Cafritz and the band began fighting, ultimately leading to her leaving the band.

They released a split single in 1989, a cover of Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;Damaged II&quot; with Tad covering &quot;Damaged I&quot; on the other side, for Sub Pop Records and another split single with Black Snakes for the Japanese indie label Supernatural Organization.

By now, Cafritz had quit the line-up. The trio of Spencer, Hagerty and Bert released one final album in 1990 called &quot;Historia de la Musica Rock&quot; for Caroline Records before calling it a day the same year. The album cover of &quot;Historia&quot; was a parody of a music compilation vinyl series from Spain called &quot;Historia de la Música Rock&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Spencer co-founded Boss Hog with former Pussy Galore guitarist Cristina Martinez in the late 1980s just prior to the dissolution of Pussy Galore itself. Spencer and Martinez had married in 1989 (and are still married today). He also went on to form the Blues Explosion. Neil Hagerty continued his &#x27;noise-terrorist&#x27; career with his girlfriend, Jennifer Herrema, in blues-rock duo Royal Trux, which the pair had formed in Chicago during 1987. Cafritz and Bert joined forces briefly in the early 1990s to release a self-titled album under the name Action Swingers.

Two years after the breakup, their CD compilation &quot;Corpse Love: The First Year&quot; was released. It included four tracks from the &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; cassette, as well as some previously released early material, including short interviews.

<doc id="847791" wikidata="Q919324" url="?curid=847791" title="James Dudley">
<text>James Dudley (May 12, 1910 – May 26, 2004) was an African-American baseball player, professional wrestling manager, and professional wrestling executive. He played Negro league baseball for nine years but is best known for his time with the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Dudley was the first African-American to run a major United States arena (Turner&#x27;s Arena in Washington, D.C.). He worked with four generations of wrestling&#x27;s McMahon family and was particularly close with Vincent J. McMahon. At age 74, he was put back on the company&#x27;s payroll to show appreciation for his work for the McMahons. He also managed several wrestlers in the WWWF and was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994.

== Baseball career ==
Dudley was considered an &quot;excellent athlete&quot; and ran the 100-yard dash in under ten seconds on multiple occasions. Although he showed up for the trials for the 1924 United States Olympic team, he was not allowed to participate because African Americans were not permitted on the team. After playing semi-professional baseball in Baltimore, Maryland, Dudley signed with the Baltimore Elite Giants at age 27. Nicknamed &quot;Big Train&quot;, he played catcher but started out helping pitchers warm up in the bullpen. Playing alongside two other talented catchers, Roy Campanella and Eggie Clarke, Dudley&#x27;s playing time was limited. He remained with the Elite Giants until leaving professional baseball in 1945. In total, he played about 60 games in the Negro leagues.

== Professional wrestling career ==
James Dudley began working for Jess McMahon in the 1950s, when McMahon was a co-owner of the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. When McMahon and his partners broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963, Dudley continued to work for McMahon. Dudley performed many different jobs, from carrying buckets of water to counting ticket sales. Dudley was a close friend of Vincent J. McMahon and continued working for the family when the younger McMahon took over the business from his father; in particular, he drove McMahon&#x27;s limousine and served as his bodyguard. He has said that he thought of McMahon as a father figure. McMahon later increased Dudley&#x27;s responsibilities with the company several times, and eventually assigned him to manage Turner&#x27;s Arena in Washington, D.C., which made Dudley the first African-American to hold such a position in the United States. His role required him to oversee several other events, including the &quot;Town and Country Jamboree&quot; television show.

Dudley managed several wrestlers, including Bobo Brazil. Prior to Brazil&#x27;s matches, Dudley excited the crowds by waving a towel while running to the ring. He also managed such wrestlers as Bearcat Wright, Sailor Art Thomas, and Sweet Daddy Siki. Over time, Dudley&#x27;s role with the company diminished and he ceased working for them; the company&#x27;s operations were moved to Connecticut, and Turner&#x27;s Arena was demolished. Shortly before McMahon&#x27;s death in 1984, he told his son, Vincent K. McMahon, who had taken over control of the promotion (then known as the WWF), &quot;Whatever else you do, you take care of James Dudley.&quot; After Vincent J. McMahon&#x27;s death, Dudley was put back on the company payroll at age 74 and subsequently received several gifts from Vincent K. McMahon to show appreciation for Dudley&#x27;s contributions to the company. Dudley has been described as an &quot;important cog&quot; in the company, and McMahon once stated that &quot;had there been no James Dudley, the WWF possibly wouldn&#x27;t exist as it does today&quot;. Dudley continued to feel a sense of loyalty to the McMahons and their promotion. Dudley was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Vincent K. McMahon.

Dudley&#x27;s final appearance with the company came during the January 3, 2002, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. According to the storyline, Stephanie McMahon was banned from the MCI Center. In an attempt to get past security, she pushed Dudley in a wheelchair but was still refused entrance. Following the scene, Dudley left the wheelchair, walked to his seat, and watched the show.

==Personal life==
Dudley continued to live in Washington, D.C., after retiring from professional wrestling. He had 38 grandchildren, 34 great-grandchildren, and 16 great-great-grandchildren. Dudley died of natural causes on May 26, 2004, at the age of 94.

<text>The Winslow House is a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house located at 515 Auvergne Place in River Forest, Illinois. A landmark building in Wright&#x27;s career, the Winslow House, built in 1894–95, was his first major commission as an independent architect. While the design owes a debt to the earlier James Charnley House, Wright always considered the Winslow House extremely important to his career. Looking back on it in 1936, he described it as &quot;the first &#x27;prairie house&#x27;.&quot;

The original owner, William Winslow, was exemplary of Wright&#x27;s Chicago clients, which the architect described as, &quot;American men of business with unspoiled instincts and ideals.&quot; A manufacturer of decorative ironwork, Winslow later worked with Wright on a number of publishing projects, specifically for Keats&#x27;s &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; (1896), and William C. Gannett&#x27;s &quot;The House Beautiful&quot; (1896–97). The men were first introduced through Winslow&#x27;s dealings with Adler and Sullivan, Wright&#x27;s former employers. He was in the ornamental iron business and his firm had done the facade on the Carson Pirie Scott building for Wright&#x27;s previous employer. Adler and Sullivan were not interested in performing residential architectural assignments so Winslow turned to Wright. The house&#x27;s design is inspired by the works of Wright&#x27;s mentor Louis Sullivan and anticipates Wright&#x27;s mature Prairie School buildings of the next decade. Sheltered beneath a low-pitched roof with wide eaves, the home is symmetrical and horizontally divided into a stone section, a golden Roman brick section, and a terra cotta frieze of Sullivanesque ornament. In contrast to the calm and balanced front facade, the rear is a mass of irregular geometric forms. The interior echoes both Wright&#x27;s own home and the Charnley House, with the fireplace at the center facing the entry with rooms on either side and a hidden main staircase.

The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 1970.

In 2016 the house was sold for $1.375 million. It had been owned by the general manager of a local television station. His family had owned the house for 57 years.

<text>Mark Buckingham is a British comic book artist. He is best known for his work on &quot;Marvelman&quot; and &quot;Fables&quot;.

==Career==
Born as Mark John Buckingham, on 23 May 1966, in Clevedon, England, he initially started working professionally in 1987, on strips and illustrations for a British satire magazine called &quot;The Truth&quot;, where he first worked with &quot;Neil Gaiman&quot; illustrating some of his articles. His American debut came the following year as inker on DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, taking over as penciller from issue 18.

Some of Buckingham&#x27;s earliest (non-professional) work appeared in early issues of the Clevedon Youth CND newsletter in the early 1980s (c. 1982/83), in which he satirised members of the group in a fun and amusing manner. Copies are now very hard to find, but a few are known to still be in existence.

He is most famous for his work on &quot;Marvelman&quot; (&quot;Miracleman&quot; in the USA), &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and &quot;Fables&quot;, including a story in the original graphic novel &quot;1001 Nights of Snowfall&quot;. His Marvel work includes inking Chris Bachalo&#x27;s pencils on &quot;Generation X&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider 2099&quot;, and penciling Paul Jenkins&#x27;s run on &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot;. For DC Comics, Buckingham has inked the two &quot;Death&quot; miniseries and was the original penciller on the &quot;Titans&quot; series. In the 1990s Mark shared a studio with &quot;The Beano&quot; and Marvel artist Kev F. Sutherland, working together on Marvel&#x27;s Star Trek and Doctor Strange.

On the &quot;Vertigo Voices: Fables Forum&quot; panel at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, Fables creator and writer Bill Willingham announced that he and Buckingham would switch roles in an up-coming one-off, for &quot;Fables&quot; issue #100: Buckingham would write and Willingham would illustrate.

In July 2012, as part of San Diego Comic-Con, Buckingham was one of six artists who, along with DC co-publishers Jim Lee and Dan DiDio, participated in the production of &quot;Heroic Proportions&quot;, an episode of the Syfy &#x27;reality&#x27;-television competition series &quot;Face Off&quot;, in which special effects were tasked to create a new superhero, with Buckingham and the other DC artists on hand to help them develop their ideas. The winning entry&#x27;s character, Infernal Core by Anthony Kosar, was featured in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; #16 (March 2013), which was published 30 January 2013. The episode premiered on 22 January 2013, as the second episode of the fourth season.

==Personal life==
Buckingham was married in Gijón, Spain in August 2006 to journalist and TV newscaster Irma Page. His best man was Neil Gaiman.

<text>Touching Evil is a British television drama serial following the exploits of a crack squad on the Organised &amp; Serial Crime Unit, a rapid response police force that serves the entire country.

The serial was produced by United Productions for Anglia Television, and screened on the ITV network in 1997. It was created by Paul Abbott. The first season consists of six 50-minute (one-hour with advertisements) episodes written by Abbott with Russell T Davies. The popularity of the serial led to two sequel serials in 1998 and 1999, although not written by Abbott or Davies. The first episode aired on 29 April 1997, and the last on 6 June 1999, after 16 episodes and 3 series.

The serial stars Robson Green as D.I. Dave Creegan, with Nicola Walker co-starring as his colleague D.I. Susan Taylor. The third series was co-produced by Green&#x27;s own independent production company Coastal Productions.

<doc id="847807" wikidata="Q493274" url="?curid=847807" title="Andrea Doria-class cruiser">
<text>The &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class were helicopter cruisers of the Italian Navy. Italy&#x27;s first major new designs of the post–World War II era, these ships were primarily designed for anti-submarine warfare tasks. Initially planned for three ships, the two ships that were constructed, and served until 1991 in both active and training capacities. The &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class formed the basis for the larger that followed them.

==Design==
Ordered in the 1957-58 Naval Programme, the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class were designed to operate the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) system and Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King helicopters as both a platform for anti-air and anti-submarine warfare. The hull was based on the , with a length of and an enlarged beam to allow for the installation of a flight deck and hangar, measuring . The vessels had a draught of and displaced 5,000 tons standard and 6,500 tons loaded.

The flight deck measured and was placed aft of the superstructure. It was cantilevered out at the stern to provide extra operational space.

===Power and propulsion===
The class was powered by four Foster Wheeler boilers. These provided the power to two double reduction geared steam-powered turbines creating which drove two shafts. This gave the cruisers a maximum speed of and an operating range of at .

===Armament===
For anti-air warfare the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;s were equipped with one Mk 10 twin-arm launcher with 40 RIM-2 Terrier missiles placed forward. The ships were also provided with eight Oto Melara 76 mm/62 MMI guns to be used for point-blank anti-aircraft defence. The class was originally intended to be armed with the SMP 3 76 mm/62 gun found on the , however that gun was rated poorly and was replaced. The choice to arm the cruisers with the 76 mm guns was based on a decision taken in 1958 that only guns of that size were adequate in point blank air defence. The guns were placed in six single turrets amidships abreast the funnel and the bridge.

The cruisers were also equipped with six Mk32 torpedo tubes in two triple mounts. These were for use against submarines. In conjunction with the torpedo systems, the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;s could embark up to four helicopters. The Sea Kings were found to be too large for the class and the Italians instead chose to use Agusta-Bell AB 212 helicopters modified for anti-submarine warfare.

===Electronics===
Initially, the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; class was equipped with SPS-12 and SPS-39A radars for air search and surveillance and SPQ-2 for navigation. They also carried SQS-39 sonar. The guns were automatically controlled by the Italian-designed NA-9 Orion fire control system guided by the SPG-70 radar.

==Ships==
==History==
The class consisted of two vessels both commissioned in 1964 and in service into the late 1980s. A third, &quot;Enrico Dandolo&quot; (C555), was cancelled. &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; was modernised in 1976-78, exchanging the RIM-2 missiles for the SM-1ER surface-to-air missile. The ship received an updated electronics package, mounting SPS-40 2-D air search radar, SPG-55C fire control radar and SQS-23 sonar.

&quot;Caio Duilio&quot; received only a marginal modernisation in 1979-80 and instead was modified to become a training ship. Its aft hangar was removed and replaced with classrooms and two of its 76mm mounts were removed aft. In 1980 it replaced &quot;San Giorgio&quot; as the fleet&#x27;s training vessel. Both ships mounted new electronic warfare packages, SPS-768 long-range search radars and SPR-4 intercept and SLQ-D jammers.

<doc id="847810" wikidata="Q1268939" url="?curid=847810" title="Dynamic dispatch">
<text>In computer science, dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at run time. It is commonly employed in, and considered a prime characteristic of, object-oriented programming (OOP) languages and systems.

Object-oriented systems model a problem as a set of interacting objects that enact operations referred to by name. Polymorphism is the phenomenon wherein somewhat interchangeable objects each expose an operation of the same name but possibly differing in behavior. As an example, a object and a object both have a method that can be used to write a personnel record to storage. Their implementations differ. A program holds a reference to an object which may be either a object or a object. Which it is may have been determined by a run-time setting, and at this stage, the program may not know or care which. When the program calls on the object, something needs to choose which behavior gets enacted. If one thinks of OOP as sending messages to objects, then in this example the program sends a message to an object of unknown type, leaving it to the run-time support system to dispatch the message to the right object. The object enacts whichever behavior it implements.

Dynamic dispatch contrasts with &quot;static dispatch&quot;, in which the implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at compile time. The purpose of dynamic dispatch is to defer the selection of an appropriate implementation until the run time type of a parameter (or multiple parameters) is known.

Dynamic dispatch is different from late binding (also known as dynamic binding). Name binding associates a name with an operation. A polymorphic operation has several implementations, all associated with the same name. Bindings can be made at compile time or (with late binding) at run time. With dynamic dispatch, one particular implementation of an operation is chosen at run time. While dynamic dispatch does not imply late binding, late binding does imply dynamic dispatch, since the implementation of a late-bound operation is not known until run time.

==Single and multiple dispatch==
The choice of which version of a method to call may be based either on a single object, or on a combination of objects. The former is called &quot;single dispatch&quot; and is directly supported by common object-oriented languages such as Smalltalk, C++, Java, C#, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, and Python. In these and similar languages, one may call a method for division with syntax that resembles

dividend.divide(divisor) # dividend / divisor

where the parameters are optional. This is thought of as sending a message named with parameter to . An implementation will be chosen based only on &#x27;s type (perhaps rational, floating point, matrix), disregarding the type or value of .

By contrast, some languages dispatch methods or functions based on the combination of operands; in the division case, the types of the and together determine which operation will be performed. This is known as &quot;multiple dispatch&quot;. Examples of languages that support multiple dispatch are Common Lisp, Dylan, and Julia.

==Dynamic dispatch mechanisms==
A language may be implemented with different dynamic dispatch mechanisms. The choices of the dynamic dispatch mechanism offered by a language to a large extent alter the programming paradigms that are available or are most natural to use within a given language.

Normally, in a typed language, the dispatch mechanism will be performed based on the type of the arguments (most commonly based on the type of the receiver of a message). Languages with weak or no typing systems often carry a dispatch table as part of the object data for each object. This allows instance behaviour as each instance may map a given message to a separate method.

Some languages offer a hybrid approach.

Dynamic dispatch will always incur an overhead so some languages offer static dispatch for particular methods.

===C++ implementation===
C++ uses early binding and offers both dynamic and static dispatch. The default form of dispatch is static. To get dynamic dispatch the programmer must declare a method as .

C++ compilers typically implement dynamic dispatch with a data structure called a virtual function table (vtable) that defines the name-to-implementation mapping for a given class as a set of member function pointers. This is purely an implementation detail, as the C++ specification does not mention vtables. Instances of that type will then store a pointer to this table as part of their instance data, complicating scenarios when multiple inheritance is used. Since C++ does not support late binding, the virtual table in a C++ object cannot be modified at runtime, which limits the potential set of dispatch targets to a finite set chosen at compile time.

Type overloading does not produce dynamic dispatch in C++ as the language considers the types of the message parameters part of the formal message name. This means that the message name the programmer sees is not the formal name used for binding.

===Go, Rust and Nim implementation===
In Go, Rust and Nim, a more versatile variation of early binding is used. 
Vtable pointers are carried with object references as &#x27;fat pointers&#x27; (&#x27;interfaces&#x27; in Go, or &#x27;trait objects&#x27; in Rust).

This decouples the supported interfaces from the underlying data structures. Each compiled library needn&#x27;t know the full range of interfaces supported in order to correctly use a type, just the specific vtable layout that they require. Code can pass around different interfaces to the same piece of data to different functions. This versatility comes at the expense of extra data with each object reference, which is problematic if many such references are stored persistently.

The term &quot;fat pointer&quot; simply refers to a pointer with additional associated information. The additional information may be a vtable pointer for dynamic dispatch described above, but is more commonly the associated object&#x27;s size to describe e.g. a &quot;slice&quot;. 

===Smalltalk implementation===
Smalltalk uses a type-based message dispatcher. Each instance has a single type whose definition contains the methods. When an instance receives a message, the dispatcher looks up the corresponding method in the message-to-method map for the type and then invokes the method.

Because a type can have a chain of base types, this look-up can be expensive. A naive implementation of Smalltalk&#x27;s mechanism would seem to have a significantly higher overhead than that of C++ and this overhead would be incurred for every message that an object receives.

Real Smalltalk implementations often use a technique known as inline caching that makes method dispatch very fast. Inline caching basically stores the previous destination method address and object class of the call site (or multiple pairs for multi-way caching). The cached method is initialized with the most common target method (or just the cache miss handler), based on the method selector. When the method call site is reached during execution, it just calls the address in the cache. (In a dynamic code generator, this call is a direct call as the direct address is back patched by cache miss logic.) Prologue code in the called method then compares the cached class with the actual object class, and if they don&#x27;t match, execution branches to a cache miss handler to find the correct method in the class. A fast implementation may have multiple cache entries and it often only takes a couple of instructions to get execution to the correct method on an initial cache miss. The common case will be a cached class match, and execution will just continue in the method.

Out-of-line caching can also be used in the method invocation logic, using the object class and method selector. In one design, the class and method selector are hashed, and used as an index into a method dispatch cache table.

As Smalltalk is a reflective language, many implementations allow mutating individual objects into objects with dynamically generated method lookup tables. This allows altering object behavior on a per object basis. A whole category of languages known as prototype-based languages has grown from this, the most famous of which are Self and JavaScript. Careful design of the method dispatch caching allows even prototype-based languages to have high-performance method dispatch.

Many other dynamically typed languages, including Python, Ruby, Objective-C and Groovy use similar approaches.

==Example in Python==

class Cat:
 def speak(self):
 print(&quot;Meow&quot;)

class Dog:
 def speak(self):
 print(&quot;Woof&quot;)
def speak(pet):
 # Dynamically dispatches the speak method
 # pet can either be an instance of Cat or Dog
 pet.speak()

cat = Cat()
speak(cat)
dog = Dog()
speak(dog)
==Example in C++==

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// make Pet an abstract virtual base class
class Pet {
public:
 virtual void speak() = 0;

class Dog : public Pet {
public:
 void speak() override
 std::cout « &quot;Woof!\n&quot;;
};

class Cat : public Pet {
public:
 void speak() override
 std::cout « &quot;Meow!\n&quot;;
};

// speak() will be able to accept anything deriving from Pet
void speak(Pet&amp; pet)
 pet.speak();

int main()
 Dog fido;
 Cat simba;
 speak(fido);
 speak(simba);
 return 0;

Something similar to &quot;fat pointers&quot; specifically for Intel&#x27;s real-mode on x86 processors, containing both a deliberately denormalized pointer to a shared code entry point and some info to still distinguish the different callers in the shared code. While, in an open system, pointer-normalizing 3rd-party instances (in other drivers or applications) cannot be ruled out completely on public interfaces, the scheme can be used safely on internal interfaces to avoid redundant entry code sequences.)

<text>In baseball, to tag up is for a baserunner to retouch or remain on their starting base (the time-of-pitch base) until (after) the ball is first touched by a fielder. By rule, baserunners must tag up when a hit ball is caught before it bounces by a fielder, and in such situations, are out if any fielder with possession of the ball touches their starting base before they do. After a legal tag up, runners are free to attempt to advance, even if the ball was caught in foul territory. On long fly ball outs, runners can often gain a base; when a runner scores by these means, this is called a sacrifice fly. On short fly balls, runners seldom attempt to advance after tagging up, due to the high risk of being thrown out.

==Putting out a runner who is required to tag up==
When a baserunner fails to tag up on a caught fly ball (for instance, if they started running too early, thinking the ball would not be caught), they may be &quot;doubled up/off&quot;, which results in them being called out. To double a runner off, a fielder must touch the runner&#x27;s starting base while in possession of the ball, before the runner returns to the base. If the baserunner appeared to tag up, but a fielder suspects the baserunner may have left the base too early (thus failing to legally tag up), the fielder may attempt to double the runner off by touching the runner&#x27;s starting base while controlling the ball, before the next pitch is thrown. This is considered a type of appeal play. If the umpire agrees that the runner did not retouch after the ball was touched by a fielder, the umpire will call the runner out, and anything else the runner did during the play (such as score a run) is negated. Doubling a runner off is considered a &quot;time play&quot; (as opposed to a force play), which means that even if the doubling-off is the third out of an inning, any runs which score before the double-off will count (unless the run was scored by the same runner that was doubled off, in which case the run will not count in any situation).

<text>The Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference (PDR), renamed Prescriber&#x27;s Digital Reference after its physical publication was discontinued, is a compilation of manufacturers&#x27; prescribing information (package insert) on prescription drugs, updated regularly and published by ConnectiveRx.

==History==
The original PDR was titled &quot;Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference&quot; but was renamed because not all prescribers are physicians and the reference is no longer a hardback book used on a desk. While marketed as a means of providing physicians with the full legally mandated information relevant to writing prescriptions, it was widely available in libraries and bookstores, was widely used by other medical specialists, and was sometimes valuable to the layman. The book was distributed for free to all licensed medical doctors in America; only drugs which drug manufacturers paid to appear, appeared in the PDR, and no generic drugs were listed. 

The 71st Edition, published in 2017, was the final hardcover edition, weighed in at and contained information on over 1,000 drugs. Since then, the PDR has been available online for free.

The &quot;Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference&quot; was first published in 1947 by Medical Economics Inc., a magazine publisher founded by Lansing Chapman. Medical Economics Inc. merged with Reinhold Publishing in 1966 to form Chapman-Reinhold. Litton Industries, which owned the American Book Company, acquired Chapman-Reinhold in 1968. Litton sold its publishing business to the International Thomson Organization (ITO) in 1981.

ITO successor Thomson Reuters sold the &quot;Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference&quot; to Lee Equity Partners in 2009; Lee formed the new parent company PDR Network. Lee sold PDR Network to Genstar Capital in 2015. Genstar merged PDR Network into the new company ConnectiveRx.

<text>Azdavay (formerly: &quot;Çarşamba&quot;) is a town in the Kastamonu Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is located about 74 km away to the northwest of the province center Kastamonu. It is the seat of Azdavay District. Its population is 3,227 (2021). Its elevation is .

==History==
Archaeological findings hint that history of Azdavay reaches back to the Paphlagonians in 8th century BC. The region was dominated by the Hittites, Lydians, Persians, Hellenes, Pontus, Bithynians, Romans and the Byzantines in conjunction with the general historical timeline of the Kastamonu province. During the reign of the Jandarids, it was one of the 36 districts subject to the Kastamonu Sanjak. With the conquest of the region by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II in 1460, Azdavay was annexed to the Ottoman Empire. In 1868, when the neighboring Daday was made a district of Kastamonu, Azdavay was attached to Daday as a town. After the proclamation of the Turkish republic, Azdavay was made a district in 1946, although by the secession of the towns Ağlı and Pınarbaşı in 1988, its population and land area largely decreased.

==Economy==
Mining industry, ready-made textile manufacturing, forestry, livestock and some agriculture. Although there are some greenhouses, it does not have significant effect on overall economy.

<text>A national library is a library established by a government as a country&#x27;s preeminent repository of information. Unlike public libraries, these rarely allow citizens to borrow books. Often, they include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works. A national library is that library which has the duty of collecting and preserving the literature of the nation within and outside the country. Thus, national libraries are those libraries whose community is the nation at large. Examples include the British Library in London, and the in Paris.

There are wider definitions of a national library which put less emphasis on the repository character.

National libraries are usually notable for their size, compared to those of the other libraries in the same country. Some subnational states that wish to preserve their particular cultures have established comparable libraries with all the attributes of national libraries, such as with legal deposit.

Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties. National libraries of Europe participate in The European Library. This is a service of The Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).

==History==
===Origins===

The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.

One of the first plans for a national library was devised by the English mathematician John Dee, who in 1556 presented Mary I of England with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, but his proposal was not taken up.

In England, Sir Richard Bentley&#x27;s &quot;Proposal for Building a Royal Library&quot; published in 1694 stimulated renewed interest in the subject. Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington, a wealthy antiquarian, amassed the richest private collection of manuscripts in the world at the time and founded the Cotton Library. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, many priceless and ancient manuscripts that had belonged to the monastic libraries began to be disseminated among various owners, many of whom were unaware of the cultural value of the manuscripts. Sir Robert&#x27;s genius was in finding, purchasing and preserving these ancient documents. After his death his grandson donated the library to the nation as its first national library. This transfer established the formation of the British Library.

===National libraries===

==== United Kingdom ====

The first true national library was founded in 1753 as part of the British Museum.
This new institution was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. The museum&#x27;s foundations lay in the will of the physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane, who gathered an enviable collection of curiosities over his lifetime which he bequeathed to the nation for £20,000.
Sloane&#x27;s collection included some 40,000 printed books and 7,000 manuscripts, as well as prints and drawings. The British Museum Act 1753 also incorporated the Cotton library and the Harleian library. These were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various British monarchs.

The first exhibition galleries and reading room for scholars opened on 15 January 1759, and in 1757, King George II granted it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the museum&#x27;s library would expand indefinitely.

Anthony Panizzi became the Principal Librarian at the British Museum in 1856, where he oversaw its modernization. During his tenure, the library&#x27;s holdings increased from 235,000 to 540,000 volumes, making it the largest library in the world at the time. Its famous circular Reading Room was opened in 1857. Panizzi undertook the creation of a new catalogue, based on the &quot;Ninety-One Cataloguing Rules&quot; (1841) which he devised with his assistants. These rules served as the basis for all subsequent catalogue rules of the 19th and 20th centuries, and are at the origins of the ISBD and of digital cataloguing elements such as Dublin Core.

==== France ====
In France, the first national library was the , which evolved from its origin as a royal library founded at the Louvre Palace by Charles V in 1368. At the death of Charles VI, this first collection was unilaterally bought by the English regent of France, the Duke of Bedford, who transferred it to England in 1424. It was apparently dispersed at his death in 1435. The invention of printing resulted in the starting of another collection in the Louvre inherited by Louis XI in 1461. Francis I transferred the collection in 1534 to Fontainebleau and merged it with his private library.

The appointment of Jacques Auguste de Thou as librarian in the 17th century, initiated a period of development that made it the largest and richest collection of books in the world. The library opened to the public in 1692, under the administration of Abbé Louvois, Minister Louvois&#x27;s son. Abbé Louvois was succeeded by the Abbé Bignon, or Bignon II as he was termed, who instituted a complete reform of the library&#x27;s system. Catalogues were made which appeared from 1739 to 1753 in 11 volumes. The collections increased steadily by purchase and gift to the outbreak of the French Revolution, at which time it was in grave danger of partial or total destruction, but owing to the activities of Antoine-Augustin Renouard and Joseph Van Praet it suffered no injury.

The library&#x27;s collections swelled to over 300,000 volumes during the radical phase of the French Revolution when the private libraries of aristocrats and clergymen were seized. After the establishment of the French First Republic in September 1792, &quot;the Assembly declared the &quot;Bibliotheque du Roi&quot; to be national property and the institution was renamed the &quot;Bibliothèque Nationale&quot;. After four centuries of control by the Crown, this great library now became the property of the French people.&quot;

==== Spain ====

The library was founded by King Philip V in 1711 as the Royal Library or Palace Public Library. The Royal Letters Patent that he granted, the predecessor of the current legal deposit requirement, made it mandatory for printers to submit a copy of every book printed in Spain to the library. In 1836, the Crown transferred the library to the Ministry of Governance and it was renamed as National Library of Spain. A year later, women were allowed access to the library for the first time, after a petition from writer Antonia Gutiérrez was granted by Queen Regent Maria Christina.

==== Poland ====

The National Library of Poland continues the tradition of the Załuski Library. The Załuski Library was opened to readers in Warsaw on 8 August 1747, thanks to Józef Załuski&#x27;s cooperation with his brother Andrzej Załuski, but the idea of the Library dates back to 1732 (presented in &quot;Programma literarium&quot; by Józef Załuski). The library was one of the first national libraries and largest public libraries of eighteenth-century Europe. Following the death of its founders the library became the property of the Polish state and from 1774 was named the Library of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (). In 1780 the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth granted the Library the right to receive a free legal deposit copy of every book printed in the country. Following the failed Kościuszko Uprising, on the eve of Third Partition of Poland and the collapse of Polish statehood, the Library of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was closed down and taken to St Petersburg in 1794, on the decision of Empress Catherine II, where it formed the basis of the National Library of Russia. Before taken to Russia the collections numbered about 400,000 volumes, including about 13,000 medieval and modern manuscripts.

Between 1795 and 1918 no central institution existed collecting printed and handwritten
works from the lands that had once formed Poland. Some smaller libraries aimed to fill the gap it left, albeit on a smaller scale. The National Library of Poland was re-founded after Poland regained its independence in 1918, and formally opened in 1928 under the Decree of the President of the Republic of Poland. Following the Treaty of Riga of 1921, most of the manuscripts of Zaluski Library and a large proportion of the prints were returned to Warsaw from Soviet Russia. National Library of Poland also included the collections of other Warsaw-based libraries and the collections from Rapperswil and Paris created by Polish émigré communities. During World War II the most valuable part of the National Library&#x27;s holdings – almost 800,000 registered items (including manuscripts destroyed by German Nazis) – were lost forever.

===Expansion===
The first national library to establish in the Americas became the National Library of Colombia having been founded on 9 January 1777, as the &quot;Real Biblioteca&quot; by Manuel Antonio Flórez, the Viceroy of New Granada.

In the newly formed American republic, James Madison first proposed instituting a congressional library in 1783. The Library of Congress was established on 24 April 1800, when president John Adams signed an act of Congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from Philadelphia to the new capital city of Washington. Part of the legislation appropriated $5,000 &quot;for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress ... and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them.&quot; Books were ordered from London and the collection, consisting of 740 books and three maps, was housed in the new Capitol.
The Imperial Public Library was established in 1795 by Catherine the Great, whose private collections included the domestic libraries of Voltaire and Diderot, which she had purchased from their heirs. Voltaire&#x27;s personal library is still one of the highlights of the collection. The plan of a Russian public library was submitted to Catherine in 1766 but the Empress did not approve the project for the imperial library until , eighteen months before her death. The cornerstone of the foreign-language department came from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the form of Załuski&#x27;s Library (420,000 volumes), nationalized by the Russian government at the time of the partitions. The Polish-language books from the library (numbering some 55,000 titles) were returned to Poland by the Russian SFSR in 1921.

Although Germany was only constituted as a state in 1871, the first national library was set up in the context of the German revolutions of 1848. Various booksellers and publishers offered their works to the Frankfurt Parliament for a parliamentary library. The library, led by Johann Heinrich Plath, was termed the &quot;Reichsbibliothek&quot; (&quot;Reich library&quot;). After the failure of the revolution the library was abandoned and the stock of books already in existence was stored at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. In 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the Kingdom of Saxony and the Börsenverein der Deutschen Buchhändler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a German National Library in Leipzig. Starting 1 January 1913, all publications in German were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland).

==Legal deposit and copyright==



The principle of legal deposit applies in some countries.

In the United Kingdom, the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 restates the Copyright Act 1911, that one copy of every book published there must be sent to the national library (the British Library); five other libraries (the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, the Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland, the Trinity College Library, Dublin, and the National Library of Wales) are entitled to request a free copy within one year of publication. The international nature of the book publishing industry ensures that all significant English language publications from elsewhere in the world are also included.

In the Republic of Ireland, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 specifies that one copy of every book published is to be delivered to the National Library of Ireland, the Trinity College Library, Dublin, the library of the University of Limerick, the library of Dublin City University, and the British Library. Four copies are to be delivered to the National University of Ireland for distribution to its constituent universities. Further, on demand in writing within twelve months of publication a copy is to be delivered to the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland, and the National Library of Wales.

In Australia, the Copyright Act 1968 and other state acts require that a copy of every book published in Australia be deposited with the National Library of Australia, the relevant state library for the state in which the book was published, and some states other libraries such as parliamentary and university libraries.

A similar system also exists in Canada with respect to its national library, known as Library and Archives Canada, and in Québec with respect to the National Library and Archives of Québec.

Since 1537, all works published in France must be deposited with the . Since 1997, it has also received deposits of digital works.

Since 1661, the Swedish Royal Library has been entitled to a copy of all works published in Sweden.

In Singapore, the National Library Board Act requires all publishers in Singapore to deposit two copies of every publication to the National Library Board at their own expense within four weeks from the publication date.

Other countries, like the United States, do not follow this requirement. The United States does, however, require that any publisher submit two copies of a copyrightable work to United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress – this is known as &quot;mandatory deposit&quot; – but the Library is selective about which works it retains. The international nature of the book publishing industry ensures that all significant English language publications from elsewhere in the world are also included. It also has the Federal depository libraries, which must receive a copy of all of the publications of the Government Printing Office.

In addition to having a law requiring publishers to deposit books, those countries with legal deposits usually have many other incentives for a proper and speedy deposit, such as a tie-in with laws affecting copyright of the same documents, and/or a cataloguing-in-publication (CIP) service.

Approximately three million new English-language books are retained by the British Library and Library of Congress each year.

==National bibliographic control==

One of the main goals of a national library is fulfilling their nation&#x27;s part of the common international goal of union cataloguing and/or universal bibliographic control, by ensuring the bibliographic control of all the books or book-like documents published in that particular country or talking about that particular country, in any way.

The first part of the goal is usually achieved through the means of legal deposit laws or (as is the case of the United States) by a host of different programs such as a cataloguing in publication service. By this service, the Library of Congress gives a complete catalogue entry of a book to any publisher who sends a final draft or some form of galley proof of a book currently in production. Other national libraries offer similar services or enforce mandatory practices similar to this.

The second part of the goal is achieved by thorough acquisition programs and collection development policies which target book markets in other nations, and which foster international agreements with other countries with national libraries who have national bibliographic control as one of their goals. Exchange and access protocols are defined permitting these countries to read each other&#x27;s catalogues, and to standardize catalogue entries, thus making it easier for each national library to become aware of every possible published document which might concern their country.

==International bibliographic control==
Another one of the main goals of many a national library is the &quot;export aspect&quot; and the collaborative sides of the universal bibliographic control of all the books in the world. This is done by the exchanges and accords mentioned in the previous section, and also by fostering the creation of standard conceptual tools such as library classification systems and cataloguing rules. The most commonly used of these tools is the International Standard Bibliographic Description or ISBD, which has served as a basis for national and international cataloguing codes, such as AACR2.

<text>Székesfehérvár (; ; ; ; Serbian: &quot;Стони Београд&quot;; ), known colloquially as Fehérvár (), is a city in central Hungary, and the country&#x27;s ninth-largest city. It is the regional capital of Central Transdanubia, and the centre of Fejér County and Székesfehérvár District. The area is an important rail and road junction between Lake Balaton and Lake Velence.

Székesfehérvár, a royal residence (), as capital of the Kingdom of Hungary, held a central role in the Middle Ages. As required by the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, the first kings of Hungary were crowned and buried here. Significant trade routes led to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna. Historically the city has come under Ottoman and Habsburg control, and was known in many languages by translations of &quot;white castle&quot; – , , etc.

==History==

===Pre-Hungarian===
The place has been inhabited since the 5th century BCE. In Roman times, the settlements were called &quot;Gorsium&quot; and &quot;Herculia&quot;. After the Migration Period Fejér County was the part of the Avar Khaganate, while the Slavic and Great Moravian presence is disputed. (There is no source for the name of the place before the late 10th century.) In the Middle Ages its Latin name was &quot;Alba Regalis&quot;/&quot;Alba Regia&quot;. The town was an important traffic junction between Lake Balaton and Lake Velence, several trade routes led from here to the Balkans and Italy, and to Buda and Vienna. Today, the town is a junction of seven railroad lines.

===Early Hungarian===


Grand Prince Géza of the Árpád dynasty was the nominal overlord of all seven Magyar tribes but in reality ruled only part of the united territory. He aimed to integrate Hungary into Christian Western Europe by rebuilding the state according to the Western political and social models. Géza founded the Hungarian town in 972 on four moorland islands between the Gaja stream and its tributary, the Sárvíz, one of the most important Hungarian tributaries of the Danube. He also had a small stone castle built. Székesfehérvár was first mentioned in a document by the Bishopric of Veszprém, 1009, as &quot;Alba Civitas&quot;.

István I, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, granted town rights to the settlement, surrounded the town with a plank wall, and founded a school and a monastery. Under his rule the construction of the Romanesque Székesfehérvár Basilica began (it was built between 1003 and 1038). The settlement had about 3,500 inhabitants at this time and was the royal seat for hundreds of years. 43 kings were crowned in Székesfehérvár (the last one in 1526) and 15 kings were buried here (the last one in 1540), including King St. Stephen I, Hungary&#x27;s first monarch. In the past few decades, archaeologists have excavated medieval ruins, including those of the Romanesque basilica and the mausoleum of King István I; they can now be visited.

In the 12th century, the town prospered; churches, monasteries, and houses were built. It was an important station on the pilgrim route to the Holy Land. András II issued the Golden Bull here in 1222. The Bull included the rights of nobles and the duties of the king, and the Constitution of Hungary was based on it until 1848. It is often compared to England&#x27;s &quot;Magna Carta&quot;.

During the Mongol invasion of Hungary (1241–1242), the invaders could not get close to the castle: Kadan ruled Mongol warriors could not get through the surrounding marshes because of flooding caused by melting snow. In the 13th–15th centuries, the town prospered, and several palaces were built. In the 14th century, Székesfehérvár was surrounded by city walls.

After the death of King Mátyás (1490), the German army of 20,000 men led by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I invaded Hungary. They advanced into the heart of Hungary and captured the city of Székesfehérvár, which they sacked, as well as the tomb of King Mátyás, which was kept there. His Landsknechts were still unsatisfied with the plunder and refused to go for taking Buda. He returned to the Empire in late December and the Hungarian troops liberated Székesfehérvár in the next year.

===Ottoman period===


The Ottoman Turks invaded the city after a long siege in 1543 and only after a ended in most of the defenders including the commander, György Varkoch, being locked out by wealthy citizens fearing they might incur the wrath of the Ottomans by a lengthy siege. The Ottoman Empire continued to stretch northwards, taking parts of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century, and reaching as far north as the Podolia in the mid-17th century; by the signing of the Peace of Buczacz with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1672, most of the Balkans was under Ottoman control.

Except for a short period in 1601, when Székesfehérvár was reconquered by an army led by Lawrence of Brindisi, the city remained under Ottoman administration for 145 years, until 1688, with the Ottomans being preoccupied with the Morean War. They renamed the city &quot;Beograd&quot; (&quot;White city&quot;, from Serbian &quot;Beograd&quot;) and built mosques. In the 16th–17th centuries, it looked like a Muslim city. As a result, most of the original Hungarian population fled. It became a &quot;sanjak&quot; centre in the Budin Province, known as &quot;İstolni Beograd&quot; during Ottoman rule.

Ottoman expansion in Europe ended with their defeat in the Great Turkish War in 1699. The Treaty of Karlowitz forced them to surrender the region of Hungary under Ottoman control and portions of present-day Croatia, Romania, Slovakia, and Serbia to the Habsburg Empire, which pushed the Great Migrations of the Serbs to the southern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary (though as far in the north as the town of Szentendre, in which they formed the majority of the population in the 18th century, but to smaller extent also in the town of Komárom) and Habsburg-ruled Croatia.

===Habsburg Empire===
The city began to prosper again only in the 18th century. It had a mixed population: Hungarians, Germans, Serbs, and Moravians.

By 1702, the cathedral of Nagyboldogasszony was blown up, thus destroying the largest cathedral in Hungary at that time, and the coronation temple. By the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, all kings of Hungary were obliged to be crowned in this cathedral, and to take part in coronation ceremony in the surroundings of the cathedral. The coronations after that time were held in Pozsony (now Bratislava).

In 1703, Székesfehérvár regained the status of a free royal town. In the middle of the century, several new buildings were erected (Franciscan church and monastery, Jesuit churches, public buildings, Baroque palaces). Maria Theresa made the city an episcopal seat in 1777.

By the early 19th century, the German population was assimilated. On 15 March 1848, the citizens joined the revolution. After the revolution and war for independence, Székesfehérvár lost its importance and became a mainly agricultural city. In 1909 &quot;The Times Engineering Contract List&quot; noted a bridge construction contract valued at £12,000 to be overseen by the Chief Magistrate.

===Interwar period===
New prosperity arrived between the two world wars, when several new factories were opened. In 1922 a radio station was established. It used two masts insulated against ground, each with a height of 152 metres. The last mast of the station was demolished in 2009.

===World War II===
In 1944, after the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, the city&#x27;s Jewish population was confined to a ghetto and was eventually deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, together with further 3,000 Jews from the area. The pre-war Jewish population consisted of Neolog (Reform) and Orthodox communities with their respective synagogues, and some of its members were active Zionists.

In December 1944, Fehérvár came under Russian artillery fire, and stiff fighting broke out as the Red Army advanced on the city. The Germans had chosen to concentrate their forces to protect the 15-mile gap between Fehérvár and Lake Balaton. Whereas most of the gap consisted of marsh and difficult ground, Fehérvár was the node for eight highways and six railways. Despite the heavy German defences, a Soviet flying column broke through and occupied the city on 23 December; the Germans were able to push them out on 22 January 1945. In March 1945, the area was the battleground for the last major German offensive of World War II; but following its failure Marshal Tolbukhin broke through the German lines once more and recaptured the city on 22 March. A Soviet airfield was established at nearby Szabadbattyán.

===Post-war period===

In August 1951, over 150 people were killed when two trains collided in Fehérvár.

In the aftermath of World War II, the city was subject to industrialization, like many other cities and towns in the country. The most important factories were the Ikarus Bus factory, the Videoton radio and TV factory, and the Könnyűfémmű (colloquially Köfém) aluminium processing plant, since acquired by Alcoa. By the 1970s, Székesfehérvár had swelled to more than 100,000 inhabitants (in 1945 it had only about 35,000). Several housing estates were built, but the city centre preserved its Baroque atmosphere. The most important Baroque buildings are the cathedral, the episcopal palace and the city hall.

After the end of the Communist regime in Hungary (1989), the planned economy was abandoned in favor of the implementation of a free market system; all the important factories were on the verge of collapse (some eventually folded) and thousands of people lost their jobs. However, the city profited from losing the old and inefficient companies, as an abundance of skilled labour coupled with excellent traffic connections, and existing infrastructure attracted numerous foreign firms seeking to invest in Hungary. Székesfehérvár became one of the prime destinations for multinational companies setting up shop in Hungary (Ford and IBM are some of them), turning the city into a success story of Hungary&#x27;s transition to a market economy. A few years later Denso, Alcoa, Philips, and Sanmina-SCI Corporation also settled in the city.
