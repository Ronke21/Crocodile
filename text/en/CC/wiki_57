<text>Lev&#x27;s disease, also known as Lenegre disease, is an idiopathic disease that can result in a complete heart block, or an extremely slowed heart rate, in patients with this condition. It is thought that for certain patients, this impairment of heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system is due to fibrosis and calcification of conduction cells. This disease is considered to be age related, with increasing decline seen in elderly patients.

The use of electrocardiograms, especially in non-specialized settings like emergency rooms, may incidentally reveal a dysrhythmia that can confuse diagnosis, however serial ECGs will demonstrate an evolving conduction block arrhythmia characteristic of Lev&#x27;s disease, thus allowing for correct diagnosis.

==Presentation==

=== Signs and symptoms ===
Lev&#x27;s disease may present with various signs and symptoms; however, these may overlap with similar conditions such as atrioventricular (AV) blocks. Signs of Lev&#x27;s disease may include syncope, shortness of breath, dizziness, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Signs may begin to appear as an adult. On the other hand, symptoms of Lev&#x27;s disease may include bradycardia, defects in the cardiac conduction of the His-Purkinje system, widening of the QRS complex, and temporal potentially prolongation of the PR interval. However, individuals may also be asymptomatic, presenting with no symptoms. Thus, careful genetic screening and identification of patients with Lev&#x27;s disease is important.

===Associated conditions===
Stokes–Adams attacks can be precipitated by this condition. These involve a temporary loss of consciousness resulting from marked slowing of the heart when the atrial impulse is no longer conducted to the ventricles. This should not be confused with the catastrophic loss of heartbeat seen with ventricular fibrillation or asystole.

Atrioventricular (AV) block may be a progression of Lev&#x27;s disease, in which the electrical signal transmission from the heart&#x27;s atria to the ventricles is impaired due to an extension of the fibrosis.

Bundle Branch Block (BBB) is another condition that can be precipitated by Lev&#x27;s disease. This condition is the interrupted conduction of electrical impulses along the Bundle of His or one of the bundle branches. As the Bundle of His divides into the right and left bundle branches, a block of the electrical impulse may result in a Right Bundle Branch Block or a Left Bundle Branch Block, respectively.

Sinoatrial (SA) block may also result be a result of Lev&#x27;s disease. During a SA block, the electrical impulse formed at the SA node is delayed or not conducted.

== History ==
In March 1954, researchers Richman and Wolff analyzed several patient cases using electrocardiograms and vectorcardiograms. In terms of the different cardiovascular diagnostic tests available, electrocardiograms are the most widely used between physicians. Many providers prefer the use of electrocardiograms since the process of interpreting vectorcardiograms are more complex and are more labor-intensive as it requires more electrode placement on patients. Electrocardiograms record and detect the electrical impulses generated by the heart. By doing so, medical professionals are able to analyze the electrical activity of the heart and detect any irregularities that may impact the function of the heart. However, vectorcardiogram diagnostic tests operate differently from electrocardiograms. This vectorcardiogram method analyzes the transverse, sagittal, and frontal planes to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This diagnostic test examines different factors such as rotations, contours, and the direction of the cardiac axis of the heart. Although the use of electrocardiograms are commonly used in clinical settings by many providers, vectorcardiograms are able to be more precise due to its ability to detect and identify the location of myocardial infarction, cardiac blockage, and hypertrophy. Among cases studied, patients exhibited a left bundle branch block that resembled a right bundle branch block. In comparison, however, although the electrocardiograms showed a right bundle branch block, the vectorcardiograms detected a left bundle branch block in the patient.

In March 1964, Jean Lenègre published a paper discussing the pathology behind the gradual damage and scarring of the ventricular conduction system.

In November 1964, Maurice Lev published a paper with similar findings as Lenègre where he saw the degenerative processes of the ventricular conduction system associated with calcification in older patient populations. Lev focused primarily on the anatomical process leading to atrioventricular blocks in patients and was able to build off the research conducted by Lenègre.

== Epidemiology ==
In a genetic epidemiological study published in 2012 focusing on western France, there were 6667 patients implanted with pacemakers for PCCD between the years of 1995 and 2005. The frequency of PCCD in different areas of western France was concluded to be 0.21% in a major city and up to 2.28% in specific parishes. Five large families were also identified to be affected by PCCD, contributing to the understanding that the disease has a genetic factor.

While there is limited data directly addressing Lev&#x27;s disease and its prevalence, there are also some statistics on the associated diseases precipitated by Lev&#x27;s disease.

One study published in 1998 followed 855 men born in 1913, and among the group the prevalence of bundle branch block was 17% when the study population was at age 80 years.

== Pathophysiology ==
Lev&#x27;s disease operates similarly to other atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances. Unfortunately, the specific mechanisms of this condition are not yet fully clear. However, it is suspected that like other AV conduction disorders, Lev&#x27;s disease can occur via two ways, acquired or congenital. Individuals with congenital Lev&#x27;s disease typically come from pregnancies with lupus erthematosus complications or transfer of SSA/Ro and SSB/LA antibodies. In contrast, there are many theories on how Lev&#x27;s disease may be acquired by a patient, however, there is strong evidence of fibrosis of the conduction system leading to impairments of the conduction system.

The heart is composed of two primary types of cell, contractile cells and specific cells that carry out conduction roles, including directing the actions of contractile cells. In the case of Lev&#x27;s disease, calcification or fibrosis of these cells will impact their ability to work optimally, hindering the propagation of electrical currents through the heart. It has been seen that with age, the heart&#x27;s autonomic movements begin to show rapid signs of decline, due to being governed by its ability to conduct signaling. Such issues occurring at the SA and AV nodes, will result in prorogation of ECG segments, because the pacemaker cells in these production centers are responsible for the rest of the signals traveling through the heart, and therefore the mechanical movements of cardiac muscle. In severe cases, like in Lev&#x27;s disease, this can result in entire blockage of nodal electrical propagation.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of Lev&#x27;s disease can be difficult due to the limited supporting literature. However, given that the disease shares similarities to conditions characterized by atrioventricular (AV) conduction blocks and bundle branch blocks, differential diagnostic approaches can involve considerations of related conditions.

Therefore, differential diagnoses can be conducted to help narrow down the list of possible diseases and help providers determine whether a patient may or may not have this condition. These approaches include using clinical evaluation to assess patient&#x27;s past medical history for any symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, syncope, shortness of breath. Physical examinations are also conducted to determine whether a patient has signs of bradycardia. One of the most important exams that can be conducted to help determine atrioventricular (AV) conduction block and bundle branch block is an electrocardiogram. Electrocardiograms are used primarily to measure how efficiently the heart is working. The function of electrocardiograms is detection of electrical signals in the heart. These electrical signals are recorded on a graph to help detect heart rhythm and heart attacks.

== Prevention ==
Lev&#x27;s disease remains an area of ongoing research and the specific underlying mechanisms of this disease state are not fully understood. As a result, effective prevention methods are currently limited.

Researchers do understand that Lev&#x27;s disease can be presented in two primary forms: acquired and congenital. Individuals who have acquired Lev&#x27;s disease presents signs and symptoms later in life and are often linked to the use of medication, medical conditions, surgical procedures, or environmental factors. In cases of congenital Lev&#x27;s disease, it is present from birth and is commonly caused by genetic or developmental factors. Depending if the patient has acquired or congenital Lev&#x27;s disease, the prevention strategies may differ and vary to address the needs associated with each form.

A preventive strategy can involve regular electrocardiogram tests, especially if the individual has a genetic family history of cardiac conditions such as Lev&#x27;s disease. Additionally, the use of certain medications can impact the conduction of the heart. Studies have shown that medications such as Digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and anti-arrhythmic medications can slow down heart conduction in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. Since other cardiac conditions can be associated with Lev&#x27;s disease, it is important to promote a heart healthy lifestyle. This includes adopting dietary and lifestyle changes that support and promote healthy heart health.

== Treatment and management ==
Lev&#x27;s disease continues to be an active area of research. Currently, there is limited case reports, studies, and trials revolving around the treatment for Lev&#x27;s Disease. There is no case study that gives a definitive treatment option. However, its treatment and management can be approached similarly to those for atrioventricular (AV) blocks. Both conditions involve the inability of the heart to properly conduct electrical signals; irregularity of heart beats and bradycardia. Treatment could involve implantation of a pacemaker to help restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm with ECG tests to ensure that the pacemaker is working properly.

== Case studies ==

=== Genetic testing ===
Over the years, many clinical studies have been conducted to give insight on the congenital acquirement of Lev&#x27;s Disease, particularly to answer the question of if there is a genetic component that puts patients at a predisposed risk. A mouse model studied mice with a heterogenous mutation to their SCN5a gene, which impacts the formation of Na+ channels, leaving them with myocardial conditions similar to those with Lev&#x27;s disease. The study used these mice to gain a further understanding into the progression of such abnormalities, and how it can be applied to the similar impacts of fibrosis and calcification in human myocardial systems. Their study results found that in mice with this heterozygous mutation, with age, exhibited extensive fibrosis of cardiac tissue in comparison to mice without the mutation.

<doc id="860895" wikidata="Q1425777" url="?curid=860895" title="Subjective expected utility">
<text>In decision theory, subjective expected utility is the attractiveness of an economic opportunity as perceived by a decision-maker in the presence of risk. Characterizing the behavior of decision-makers as using subjective expected utility was promoted and axiomatized by L. J. Savage in 1954 following previous work by Ramsey and von Neumann. The theory of subjective expected utility combines two subjective concepts: first, a personal utility function, and second a personal probability distribution (usually based on Bayesian probability theory).

Savage proved that, if the decision-maker adheres to axioms of rationality, believing an uncertain event has possible outcomes formula_1 each with a utility of formula_2 then the person&#x27;s choices can be explained as arising from this utility function combined with the subjective belief that there is a probability of each outcome, formula_3 The subjective expected utility is the resulting expected value of the utility,
:formula_4

If instead of choosing formula_1 the person were to choose formula_6 the person&#x27;s subjective expected utility would be
:formula_7
Which decision the person prefers depends on which subjective expected utility is higher. Different people may make different decisions because they may have different utility functions or different beliefs about the probabilities of different outcomes.

Savage assumed that it is possible to take convex combinations of decisions and that preferences would be preserved. So if a person prefers formula_8 to formula_9and formula_10 to formula_11 then that person will prefer formula_12 to formula_13, for any formula_14.

Experiments have shown that many individuals do not behave in a manner consistent with Savage&#x27;s axioms of subjective expected utility, e.g. most prominently Allais (1953) 
and Ellsberg (1961).

<doc id="860897" wikidata="Q425109" url="?curid=860897" title="Tetryzoline">
<text>Tetryzoline (INN), also known as tetrahydrozoline, is a drug used in some over-the-counter eye drops and nasal sprays. Tetryzoline was patented in 1954, and came into medical use in 1959.

==Side effects==
Tetryzoline eye drops may cause blurred vision, eye irritation and dilated pupils. Tetryzoline is not suitable for prolonged use as its vasoconstrictive effects within the eye eventually decrease or stop. If tolerance to the drug has developed, ceasing its use may cause a rebound effect and &quot;increase&quot; redness of the eyes — ⁠a vasodilatory effect.

Intranasal use of tetryzoline may cause transient burning, stinging, or dryness of the mucosa and sneezing. Prolonged intranasal use often causes opposite effects in the form of rebound congestion with effects such as chronic redness, swelling and rhinitis. Prolonged use thus may result in overuse of the drug.

In children, it might cause profound sedation.

=== Overdose ===
Overdose most often causes slow heart rate. Respiratory depression, low blood pressure, constricted pupils, hypothermia, brief episodes of high blood pressure, drowsiness, headaches and vomiting may also occur. In serious cases some of these effects may result in circulatory shock. Most often overdoses occur in children who have ingested the drug.

There is no antidote for tetryzoline or other similar imidazoline analogue poisoning, but the symptoms can be alleviated. With treatment, death is rare.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Tetryzoline is an alpha agonist for the alpha-1 receptor. This action relieves the redness of the eye caused by minor ocular irritants. Moreover, to treat allergic conjunctivitis, tetryzoline can be combined in a solution with antazoline.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
In a healthy person, the biological half-life of tetryzoline is approximately 6 hours, and it is excreted in urine, chemically unchanged, at least in part. In one study, 10 people were given two drops of 0.5 mg/mL of tetryzoline eye drops (0.025–0.05 mg) at 0 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, and 12 hrs. Within a 24-hour time window, since the last dose of tetryzoline, the blood serum concentration of tetryzoline in the test subjects was 0.068-0.380 ng/mL and the urine concentration was 13–210 ng/mL. Both the blood and the urine levels of tetryzoline reached their maximums approximately 9 hrs after the last dose. These fluid-concentration levels correspond to normal ocular use of tetryzoline; thus, greater concentrations of tetryzoline in the blood and the urine of the user can indicate misuse of the drug or of poisoning with the drug.

==Chemistry==
Chemically, tetryzoline is a derivative of imidazoline. It has two enantiomers.

==Society and culture==

===Names===
Tetryzoline is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN).

===Urban legend===
An urban legend suggests that tetryzoline can cause violent diarrhea if given orally, such as by putting a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting person&#x27;s beverage. However, the actual results of the prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Larger doses can cause death. Diarrhea is not a side effect.

===Criminal use===
In late August 2018, a South Carolina woman was charged with murdering her husband by putting eye drops containing tetryzoline in his drinking water. An autopsy found a high concentration of tetryzoline in his body.

Tetryzoline has been used as a date rape drug in a number of cases due to its ability to cause dizziness and unconsciousness.

In 2018, a 62 year-old woman in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, died in an apparent overdose or suicide involving tetryzoline and other substances; in November 2023 her caregiver was convicted of first-degree murder, following the allegation that her death was caused by a water bottle laced with Visine.

In 2019, a North Carolina paramedic was accused of using tetryzoline eye drops to cause the death of his wife. The blood sample results showed about 30–40 times higher than the therapeutic level of tetryzoline.

===Use in Media===

In the 9-1-1 Season 4 Episode 13 &quot;Suspicion&quot;, a mother, Sheila, poisons her son, Charlie, with tetryzoline eye drops by putting it into his food to make him seem sick and gain donations as a form of Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Charlie later poisons Sheila the same way with the same medication.

<doc id="860898" wikidata="Q126226" url="?curid=860898" title="Budgie (TV series)">
<text>Budgie is a British television series starring pop star Adam Faith which was produced by ITV company London Weekend Television and broadcast on the ITV network between 1971 and 1972.

The series was created by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. The show was produced by Verity Lambert with Rex Firkin as Executive Producer. In an interview for the 2006 DVD release, Lambert stated that the series was originally going to be called &quot;The Loser&quot; but this was rejected by the TV Network. The show had two theme songs: the first was &quot;The Loner&quot; by The Milton Hunter Orchestra, and the second was &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot; written by Ray Davies and performed by Cold Turkey.

==Series plot==

The series consisted of a sequence of stories – sometimes spread across two episodes – depicting Budgie&#x27;s involvement in some hare-brained scheme to make money, usually somewhere on the wrong side of legality, and invariably for the local boss, Mr Endell. He often failed in his aim, being continually the victim of circumstance or of the sharper, more experienced underworld operators he tried to emulate.

The opening credits were particularly iconic: showing Budgie trying to grab large numbers of banknotes blowing in the wind.

Plots included:
*Trying to unload thousands of stolen ballpoint pens he has unwisely bought from one fence, paying too much in the process. He finds that the pens are all stamped with a logo, possibly &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;, making them unsellable. Apparently these were the classic &quot;trading commodity&quot;, the only object being to sell them to another sucker. Charlie offers to take them off Budgie&#x27;s hands for next to nothing in exchange for a favour or two, and promptly unloads them to another villain.
*Arranging a pornographic film show in a hotel and having assured the &quot;punters&quot; that the film was &quot;the real Laurel and Hardy, if you know what I mean&quot;, making his escape before they find out the film really is a Laurel and Hardy movie.
*Accidentally stealing a vanload of pornographic magazines from the police, and then having to destroy the evidence. The wind blows the pages from the bonfire Budgie and his pal have made and they blow all over a field where a prison wardens-versus-prisoners cricket match is imminently to be played.

===Series One===

The story begins with Ronald Bird (nicknamed &quot;Budgie&quot;) being released from an open prison and trying to find a living in whatever way possible. He meets Charlie Endell in a bar with a 15-year-old stripper (Adrienne Posta) and Endell asks Budgie to look after her for a week. Budgie asks his part-time actress girlfriend Hazel Fletcher (Lynn Dalby) to help.

In the one-hour pilot he accidentally steals the wrong Ford Transit but this is beneficial as it is a police-owned van full of confiscated pornography heading for destruction. Budgie reckons he can sell it, however Mr Endell insists that he burns it all. The wind catches the paper and the pornography blows off the bonfire just as a busload of cricket players arrive. Budgie comes away with a fruit machine from the cricket club which he takes to Hazel&#x27;s flat.

They drive off but his assistant Grogan says he is going off with Charity (the stripper). Budgie is left to explain this to Mr Endell.

Eventually all his supposed friends desert him; he ends up back in court for handling stolen goods: a fruit machine stolen from a cricket club and featured in the storyline of the first episode. In reality, Charlie Endell has shopped him for this. Ironically one of Budgie&#x27;s lesser crimes, he is found guilty... not helped by poor advice from his lawyer.

===Series Two===

Series two begins with Budgie in an &quot;open nick&quot;: Fern Open Prison. Fellow prisoners include Wossname Walsh (James Bolam). Budgie has three weeks left until release. He has had few visitors until Mr Endell comes, but only is there to retrieve £3,000 from another prisoner, Dutchy Holland (Bill Dean). Budgie will get a 10% cut if he can retrieve this. When Budgie is released two cars are waiting: his ex-wife and Charlie. He must choose.

On release (episode two of series 2) he stays with his wife for a few days. He encounters a street preacher (Gordon Jackson) who leads &quot;The Brothers of Happiness&quot;. A chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend Hazel, who is now living with someone else, and Budgie finding out that his wife has been sleeping with a friend of Budgie&#x27;s, from the same open prison, force Budgie to move back in with his girlfriend and his son Howard, who is now two years old. Budgie carried on much as he did in the first series, which also started with him being released from the same open prison from a previous sentence. The second series ended with him being beaten up by both his boss and one of his henchmen. This, combined with the fact that Budgie&#x27;s mother has recently died, his father not wanting him, his girlfriend becoming pregnant by Budgie, and that he wants to leave Hazel for a stripper he has recently slept with who then tells him that she is moving abroad, makes Budgie even more depressed and eventually makes him head off into a new life. This is where the series ended.

==Cast==
The title role, a chirpy cockney petty criminal newly out of prison, was played by pop singer Adam Faith; it was his first starring role for television. The character&#x27;s name was Ronald &#x27;Budgie&#x27; Bird, nicknamed after the budgerigar birds sometimes kept as pets in England.

The series co-starred Iain Cuthbertson as Charles (Charlie) Endell, a suave and Machiavellian Glaswegian gangster based in London, who employed Budgie, often against his own better judgement, or when he was in need of an unsuspecting scapegoat. June Lewis played his silent wife Mrs Endell. During the late 1970s, Scottish Television produced a short-lived spin-off series, &quot;Charles Endell Esquire&quot;.

The only other regular member of the cast was Lynn Dalby as Budgie&#x27;s girlfriend, Hazel Fletcher. Stella Tanner had a semi-regular role as her mother, Mrs Fletcher. Rio Fanning appeared three times as Budgie&#x27;s gullible criminal Irish pal, Grogan. Guest stars included Georgina Hale as Budgie&#x27;s wife Jean, George Tovey as his father, Jack Bird, and Adrienne Posta as a stripper and Nicholas Smith as a Detective. John Rhys-Davies had an early semi-regular role as a corpulent gangster working for Endell, with the name of Laughing Spam Fritter.

Budgie&#x27;s dad Jack Bird is played by George Tovey and his mum Alice by Julia McCarthy. His sister Violet (Vi) is played by Anne Carrol. Vi&#x27;s fiancée/husband Tony Pringle is played by Donald Douglas. The neighbour Mrs L. is Barbara New. Charlie Endell&#x27;s mousey wife is played by June Lewis.

Series two broadened the characters to include Endell&#x27;s secretary, Mrs Beecham (Nan Munro) and Budgie&#x27;s wife (Georgina Hale). Avril Elgar played Mrs Silverstone, a rich woman being fleeced by a fake religious movement led by &quot;Soapy Simon&quot; (Gordon Jackson).
Derek Jacobi played Hazel&#x27;s cousin Herbert in one episode where Budgie introduces him to the sordid side of London&#x27;s Soho district. Kenneth Cranham was the main support as Inky Ballantine in the episode &quot;24000 Ballpoint Pens&quot;, with Alfie Bass in the same episode as the ironically named fence, Dickie Silver.

Budgie&#x27;s &quot;bit on the side&quot;, Inga Loveborg, was played by Margaret Nolan.

==Production==
Two series, each of 13 episodes, were made. Although colour equipment had been introduced two years earlier, the first four episodes were made in monochrome because of industrial action.

A further series may have been planned for 1973, although this coincided with Adam Faith being seriously injured in a car crash, and announcing his retirement from acting as a result. Despite a full recovery by Faith and his eventual return to acting, a further series was never commissioned.
The television channel Talking Pictures TV began a repeat of the entire series from 13 April 2024.

==Musical version==
A musical based on the characters of the series (but featuring only Adam Faith from the original TV cast), with a book by the scriptwriters of the original series, opened at the Cambridge Theatre in London on 18 October 1988, and ran for three months.

<text>Keith Spencer Waterhouse CBE (6 February 1929 – 4 September 2009) was a British novelist and newspaper columnist and the writer of many television series. He was also a noted arbiter of newspaper style and journalistic writing.

==Biography==
Keith Waterhouse was born in Hunslet, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He performed two years of national service in the Royal Air Force.

His credits, many with lifelong friend and collaborator Willis Hall, include satires such as &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, &quot;BBC-3&quot; and &quot;The Frost Report&quot; during the 1960s; the book for the 1975 musical &quot;The Card&quot;; &quot;Budgie&quot;; &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot;; and &quot;Andy Capp&quot; (an adaptation of the comic strip).

His 1959 book &quot;Billy Liar&quot; was subsequently filmed by John Schlesinger with Tom Courtenay as Billy. It was nominated in six categories of the 1964 BAFTA awards, including Best Screenplay, and was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1963; in the early 1970s the sitcom &quot;Billy Liar&quot; based on the character was quite popular and ran to 25 episodes.

Waterhouse&#x27;s first screenplay was the film &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; (1961). He also wrote &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; for Schlesinger. Without receiving screen credit, Waterhouse and Hall claimed to have extensively rewritten the script for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966). Waterhouse wrote the comic play, &quot;Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell&quot; (1989; Old Vic premiere, 1999), based on the louche life of London journalist Jeffrey Bernard.

His career began at the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; and he also wrote regularly for &quot;Punch&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and latterly for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. He initially joined the &quot;Mirror&quot; as a reporter in 1952, before he became a playwright and novelist; during his initial stint, he campaigned against the colour bar in post-war Britain, the abuses committed in the name of the British Empire in Kenya and the British government&#x27;s selling of weapons to various Middle Eastern countries. Subsequently, he returned as a columnist, initially in the &quot;Mirror Magazine&quot;, moving to the main newspaper on 22 June 1970, on Mondays, and extending to Thursdays from 16 July 1970. Waterhouse published extracts from the columns in the books &quot;Mondays, Thursdays&quot; and &quot;Rhubarb, Rhubarb and Other Noises&quot;.

His extended style book for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Waterhouse on Newspaper Style&quot;, is regarded as a classic textbook for modern journalism. This was followed by a pocket book on English usage intended for a wider audience entitled &quot;English Our English (And How To Sing It)&quot;. He moved from the &quot;Mirror&quot; to the &quot;Mail&quot; in 1986 out of his objection to the &quot;Mirror&quot; ownership by Robert Maxwell, and remained at the &quot;Mail&quot; until shortly before his death.

He fought long crusades to highlight what he perceived to be a decline in the standards of modern English; for example, he founded the Association for the Abolition of the Aberrant Apostrophe, whose members attempt to stem the tide of such solecisms as &quot;potatoe&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;pound&#x27;s of apple&#x27;s and orange&#x27;s&quot; in greengrocers&#x27; shops.

In February 2004, he was voted Britain&#x27;s most admired contemporary columnist by the &quot;British Journalism Review&quot;.

==Death==
On 4 September 2009, a statement released by his family announced that Waterhouse had died quietly in his sleep at his home in London. He was 80 years old.

<text>The Curb Event Center is a multipurpose arena on the campus of Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.

Named in honor of its prime donor, music executive and former lieutenant governor of California Mike Curb, the arena was completed in 2003, replacing the former Striplin Gym. It is the home venue of Belmont&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams and hosted the 2004 and 2005 Atlantic Sun Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournaments. In June 2004 it hosted some of the junior and preliminary events of the U.S.Gymnastics Championships. It seats 5,085 people for sporting events and hundreds more for events such as concerts and graduations where much of the floor is available for seating. It also hosts the graduation of the seniors of several local schools, including East Literature Magnet, Antioch High School, John Overton Comprehensive High School and Ravenwood High School.

On April 10, 2006, the arena hosted the nationally televised CMT Music Awards for the first time and in September 2011 featured special guest and keynote speaker Dr. Maya Angelou in celebration of its 10th Annual Humanities Symposium.

Curb Event Center hosted a United States presidential debate in 2008 and hosted another in 2020.

<text>Leonard Jimmie Savage (born Leonard Ogashevitz; 1917 – 1971) was an American mathematician and statistician. Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was &quot;one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.&quot;

== Education and career ==
Savage was born and grew up in Detroit. He studied at Wayne State University in Detroit before transferring to University of Michigan, where he first majored in chemical engineering, then switched to mathematics, graduating in 1938 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree. He continued at the University of Michigan with a PhD on differential geometry in 1941 under the supervision of Sumner Byron Myers. Savage subsequently worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.

During World War II, Savage served as chief &quot;statistical&quot; assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the &quot;Macy conferences&quot; on cybernetics.

== Research and contributions ==
His most noted work was the 1954 book &quot;The Foundations of Statistics&quot;, in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.

One of Savage&#x27;s indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson&#x27;s subsequent writing that &quot;random walk&quot; (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.

In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory. The Hewitt–Savage zero–one law and Friedman–Savage utility function are (in part) named after him, as is the Savage Award given annually by the International Society for Bayesian Analysis for the best dissertations in Bayesian analysis.

<doc id="860916" wikidata="Q2790662" url="?curid=860916" title="Big Brother (American TV series)">
<text>Big Brother is an American television reality competition show based on the Dutch reality show of the same name created by producer John de Mol Jr. in 1997; the series takes its name from the character in George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four.&quot; The American series launched on July 5, 2000, on CBS and since the discontinuation of the Spanish version in 2022, is the longest-running adaptation in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; franchise.

The show broadly follows the premise of other versions, in which a group of contestants, known as &quot;HouseGuests&quot;, live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the &quot;Outside World&quot; for a cash prize of $750,000 ($500,000 prior to season 23). The HouseGuests are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, HouseGuests are evicted by being voted out of the competition.

In its inaugural season (which followed the original Dutch format and audience voting determined evictees and the eventual winner), ratings declined, and critical reaction grew increasingly negative, prompting the series to be revamped for the second season, which focused on competition and gameplay.

The show&#x27;s twenty-sixth season premiered on July 17, 2024; its twenty-seventh season will premiere in the summer of 2025.

==Format==
&quot;Big Brother&quot; is a reality game show in which a group of contestants (referred to as &quot;HouseGuests&quot;), live in a custom-built house (also known as the &quot;Big Brother House&quot;) for three straight months under constant video surveillance. While in the House, the HouseGuests are completely isolated from the &quot;Outside World&quot;, without any contact with those not in the House; this rule could be bypassed in the event of a medical injury, a family emergency, or death. The format of the series is viewed as a social experiment that requires HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices.

Although it is a competition, the series allows viewers to witness the relationships formed in the House (also known as &quot;Showmances&quot;) and the behavior of the HouseGuests. As of January 2025, there have been a total of 37 Showmances formed; 10 of them that are still ongoing to date later took their relationships into the Outside World once a &quot;Big Brother&quot; season ended.

While locked inside the House, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game for any unforeseen reason (also known as &quot;walking&quot;), though they will not be allowed re-entry. Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be removed from the House (also known as &quot;getting expelled&quot;) and barred from return; as of January 2025, only 5 expulsions have occurred throughout the history of the show.

===Season 1===

The premiere season resembled the original Dutch version of the show — a format adapted by most versions. Because it emphasized the social experiment aspects of the premise, the competitive aspects were minimized: HouseGuests did not compete for power or safety, and the nominations process were not discussed by the HouseGuests.

The first season received negative reactions from both critics and viewers.

====Competitions (&quot;Challenges&quot;)====
All competitions used in the first season were referred to as &quot;challenges&quot; in which all of the HouseGuests had to take part. Those competitions were divided up into three groups: &quot;food&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot; and &quot;live challenges&quot;. For most of the food challenges, each HouseGuest was required to wager a certain percentage of their allowance, up to 50%, in order to complete a certain objective.

There was also a &quot;luxury challenge&quot; that occurred in its 11th week, in which the HouseGuest who finds a lucky golden ticket would then be whisked away to attend the Primetime Emmy Awards.

====Nominations and Evictions (&quot;Banishments&quot;)====
Every two weeks, each HouseGuest participated in a mandatory vote called Nomination, which decided a list of HouseGuests that are eligible to be nominated for eviction. One at a time, the HouseGuests entered the &quot;Red Room&quot; (later called the &quot;Diary Room&quot; but also known as the &quot;Confession Room&quot; in other international versions) and secretly nominated two of the others, providing full reasons for their nominations; the two HouseGuests with the most nomination votes are then put up for eviction (also known on-air as &quot;Marked for Banishment&quot;). In the event of a tie, three or more HouseGuests with the most nomination votes became nominated for eviction. Towards the end of the season, the nomination process was changed to a weekly process.

After the nominations were finalized, the American public then had the opportunity to decide which HouseGuest should be evicted (&quot;banished&quot;) through televoting, which lasted over the course of a full week. The HouseGuest with the most votes from the public was then declared evicted from the House (or, in other words, eliminated from the game).

====The Final Vote====
When there were three HouseGuests left, the final vote was changed to determine the winner. The HouseGuest with the most public votes from that point won the $500,000 prize, while the runners-up left with $100,000 (for 2nd place) and $50,000 (for 3rd place) respectively.

===Season 2–present===

Having spent millions on the series, CBS announced a second season of the series with major changes occurring to the format, putting more emphasis on competition and strategy bearing resemblance to another one of its shows, &quot;Survivor.&quot;

All aspects of the game remained the same. However, instead of having the American public decide on which HouseGuest to evict, the HouseGuests themselves now do the honors of evicting one another; unlike other international versions of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, the HouseGuests can now discuss the nominations and evictions openly and freely. HouseGuests also get to compete for safety and power during their stay in the House.

As is the case in season 1, the game continues in this current format until it reaches its final day (also known as &quot;Finale Night&quot;) in which a panel of evicted HouseGuests (also known as the &quot;Big Brother Jury&quot;) vote on which of the two finalists will be crowned the winner; the season&#x27;s winner, on that night, receives the grand prize, in cash, of $750,000 ($500,000 prior to season 23) while the runner-up receives a consolation prize, also in cash, of $75,000 ($50,000 prior to season 23).

====Competitions====

=====Head of Household (H.O.H.)=====
The Head of Household competition, introduced in season 2, is held at the beginning of each week and is most often occurred during the live eviction episode, unless otherwise specified. The winner of the H.O.H. competition receives immunity from eviction as well as special privileges such as their own personal bedroom, free laundry service and, most importantly, the power to nominate two HouseGuests for the upcoming eviction. However, the incumbent H.O.H. is not allowed to compete in the following week&#x27;s competition, meaning that a HouseGuest cannot hold the title for a second consecutive week, except for the final week or any other stated circumstances.

Most often, the first Head of Household competition will require HouseGuests to participate either in pairs or in teams. While seasons 4, 5 and 8 had the HouseGuests competing in pairs, seasons 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 all saw them competing as a group.

The live Head of Household competitions are typically quiz-based, and will see HouseGuests eliminated in each round. Competitions such as &quot;Majority Rules&quot; have been used numerous times, with the game being played in seasons 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12; a variation of the competition was used in season 7.

Some competitions will attempt to cause drama in the house, such as &quot;En Garde&quot;, in which the winner of each round selected the next two players to face off against one another. This competition was later used in seasons 10–16.

Various competitions throughout the season will be endurance, requiring HouseGuests to be the last one remaining. Endurance competitions are often held after game changing announcements, such as when a previously evicted HouseGuest returns. Various endurance competitions may have punished or rewarded HouseGuests who either fall off first or last.

Skill-based competitions also appear frequently throughout the season, some of which may last for numerous hours. Skill competitions, such as the &quot;Big Brother Open&quot; in season 13, are finished during the live eviction broadcast.

======Nominations======
One of the Head of Household&#x27;s most important duties is to nominate two HouseGuests that will be put up for eviction; every Nomination Ceremony takes place at the kitchen table. This nomination process continues until there are three HouseGuests left.

Originally, the H.O.H. placed the keys of the HouseGuests who were safe into the Nomination Box, a circular device with numbered key slots, then placed the keys of the remaining two that would be nominated into a small box located in its suite. At the start of the Nomination Ceremony, the H.O.H. places the Nomination Box onto a flat spinning device called the Lazy Susan and proceeded to pull out the first key, revealing the name of the first HouseGuest who is safe. The Lazy Susan is then spun to that HouseGuest who then places its key around its neck and then pulled out the next key. This process continued until all the keys were pulled out of the box, in which the two remaining HouseGuests, who were keyless, were then declared nominated for eviction.

The nomination process was simplified beginning in season 16; the H.O.H. places the keys of the two chosen nominees onto a smaller Nomination Box, and then, at the Nomination Ceremony, turns those keys to the left revealing the photos of those nominees which appear on the Memory Wall.

In the case of Double Eviction Night, the H.O.H. simply names the two nominees at the Living Room by word-of-mouth.

Some seasons also featured special competitions or other ways of nomination (usually because of twists) that can accommodate three or four nominated HouseGuests.

======Final Competition======
When there are only three HouseGuests left, they get to participate in the season&#x27;s final Head of Household competition, which is divided into three rounds: the first is endurance-based, the second is skill-based (often with a memory component), and the final is quiz-based (usually narrated by the evicted HouseGuests). The winners of the first two rounds then get to participate in the final round; the winner there not only secures a spot in the Final Two, as well as being guaranteed at least the second place cash prize, but also gets to cast the sole eviction vote on one of the remaining two HouseGuests, since those two are nominated by default, automatically leaving the other in the House to prepare for a meeting with the Jury.

Since season 11, it is now common for the Final Three HouseGuests to reach Finale Night, with the winners of the first two rounds of the competition going head-to-head in the final round which occurs live on that night.

=====Power of Veto (P.O.V.)=====

The Power of Veto competition, introduced in season 3, occurs two days after the previous Head of Household competition; this allows the winner of that power to either remove one eviction nominee from the chopping block or leave the Head of Household&#x27;s original choices intact. This process continues until there are three HouseGuests left.

During its first season of use, it was originally known as the &quot;Silver Power of Veto&quot; but it did not allow a nominated HouseGuest to use it on themselves; the final Power of Veto that season was the &quot;Golden Power of Veto&quot; and that power allowed a nominated HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block. The Golden Power of Veto was later made permanent to use in all future competitions in subsequent seasons, beginning in season 4.

Power of Veto competitions differ drastically from the Head of Household competitions, with competitions being more skill-based in nature. Competitions such as &quot;Pop Goes the Veto!&quot;, which required HouseGuests to find letter tiles and spell the longest word, have been used in numerous consecutive seasons.

Various competitions, such as &quot;Big Brother Boardwalk&quot;, which saw HouseGuests attempt to guess how much of an item there is, do not require HouseGuests to compete in a physical-based competition.

Other competitions, such as &quot;How Bad Do You Want It?&quot; in season 7, saw HouseGuests taking punishments in exchange for advancing; variations of this competition have been used in numerous subsequent seasons.

======Selection Process======
Before the start of every Power of Veto competition, the current Head of Household and the two eviction nominees get to select three additional HouseGuests, thus bringing the total number of players to six, with the H.O.H. always picking first; prior to season 5, all HouseGuests were allowed to compete. This process continues until there are six HouseGuests left, in which they all get to play in the next Veto competition, which most often takes place in the live Double Eviction episode.

Originally, the H.O.H. and the nominees chose the three additional players by word-of-mouth. This changed in season 7 when they were forced to choose the players by a random &quot;blind draw&quot;, pulling out either a ping-pong ball or flat disc, depending on the season, to reveal their choice; should one of them reveal a ball or disc that reads either &quot;HouseGuest&#x27;s Choice&quot; or one of their own names, the player that drew it or got drawn on then gets to make the next available selection by word-of-mouth.

In the event of three nominees joining the H.O.H. (usually because of twists), only two additional players would then be selected.

======Veto Meeting======
Two days after the Power of Veto competition, the winning Veto holder calls all HouseGuests, who were waiting patiently in the Backyard, into the Living Room. The holder then begins the meeting by explaining its power and ask for the two eviction nominees to give their final pleas, if they are allowed to do so.

If the Veto holder decides to use this power, the Veto is then placed around the neck of the HouseGuest that the holder has chosen to save; when that happens, the current Head of Household is then forced to choose the replacement nominee. However, if the holder decides not to use the Veto, it is then placed inside a box situated on the Living Room&#x27;s coffee table. Regardless of decision, the holder then adjourns the meeting by closing the box shut.

In the event of two Vetoes being held (usually because of twists), the second Veto holder gets to make the first decision, with the current H.O.H. then being forced to name the replacement nominee should that Veto be used, followed by the first holder who then follows the same process.

======Diamond Power of Veto======

The &quot;Diamond Power of Veto&quot;, a variant of this power used in season 12, allowed one HouseGuest to remove themselves from the block as well as choose the replacement nominee only moments before the live eviction.

Season 14 also had the Diamond Power of Veto, but that variant carried the same function as the Golden Power of Veto.

======Final Competition======
When there are four HouseGuests left, they get to participate in the season&#x27;s final Power of Veto Competition. The winner of that competition not only secures a spot in the Final Three but also gets to decide which HouseGuest will cast the sole vote to evict on one of the two nominees.

If the last Veto winner is one of the two eviction nominees, that nominee then decides whether to use it either on itself or the other nominee and have the only replacement nominee available take that person&#x27;s place or, as it is rare, leave the current Head of Household&#x27;s original choices intact. If the winner is the current H.O.H., then that H.O.H. does the same process as normal. However, should the replacement nominee win the Veto, then no Veto Meeting is held and the H.O.H.&#x27;s final nominations are automatically locked in.

Regardless of result, the H.O.H. is not allowed to cast the sole eviction vote; only the HouseGuest who is not a nominee does this action.

=====Other Competitions=====
The food and luxury competitions, which have been a staple of the show since season 1, have also changed over time to reflect the current nature of the game; Head of Household and Power of Veto competitions, since season 16, are now commonly used to accommodate special food and luxury privileges.

======Food Competitions (Have-Not)======
In the early seasons, the losers of a Have-Not competition would be placed on a peanut butter and jelly diet and would not be permitted to eat any other foods. Beginning in season 7, the losers were required to eat &quot;Big Brother Slop&quot; for food, and sleep in a special Have-Not room with cold showers and most discomforts such as hard pillows and beds for a week.

In some seasons, a HouseGuest can also win a &quot;Never-Not Pass&quot; which they would be immune from being a Have-Not for the remainder of the season.

Since season 22, subsequent weeks forego Have-Not competitions. Instead, either the current Head of Household or the previous Have-Not recipients decide the next ones for the week, with the exception of a few weeks which reset the process, such as weeks without a Have-Not phase or a competition is held. The choice of deciding the Have-Not can be of any HouseGuests except for the reigning Head of Household or the incumbents, or one team in the case of teams (first seen in season 23).

HouseGuests can be penalized for not following Have-Not rules, which is usually incorporated with a penalty vote for eviction, or in some cases, an additional day of a Have-Not.

======Luxury Competitions======
The HouseGuests also frequently compete in luxury competitions during their time in the House, with most frequently, the right to watch a film or television show in the house, or a small cash prize.

When competitions for films or television shows occur, an actor or actress from the series may enter the house to host the competition or speak with the HouseGuests. Actors such as Jeremy Piven, David Hasselhoff, and Neil Patrick Harris have all entered the house to participate in luxury competitions or rewards.

====Evictions====
At the end of the week, on the Live Eviction episode, all HouseGuests, with the exception of the Head of Household and the two nominees, cast a vote, one by one, privately inside the Diary Room to determine which one of the two nominees should be evicted; prior to season 10, the HouseGuests&#x27; eviction votes were revealed in prerecorded segments. The HouseGuest receiving a majority of the eligible HouseGuest&#x27;s votes is then evicted from the House.

In the event of a tie in the voting, the Head of Household then gets to cast the deciding vote, but only on nights in which the H.O.H. is allowed to do so. Once the HouseGuest is evicted, the evictee must then, on instructions given by the host before the revealing of the votes, take a few moments in bidding farewell messages to any remaining HouseGuests and gather his or her personal belongings before walking out the front door.

=====Variants=====
Some eviction ceremonies have at least one week with a different variant which was first seen since season 5.

A notable variant, called Double Eviction, has been done in two forms. The first, dubbed Double Eviction Week (or &quot;Fast Forward Week&quot;), had all weeklong events occur in an accelerated format, so that two HouseGuests are evicted over a week; the Double Eviction Week has become a staple of the show, particularly in the penultimate week featuring the Final 5 and Final 4 evictions. The second, Double Eviction Night, introduced in season 7, had the events of the week occur over the course of the Live Eviction episode, with the event also becoming a staple of the show.

Season 22 introduced the Triple Eviction Night, where two weeks&#x27; worth of game events are played within an extended Live Eviction episode so that three HouseGuests are evicted; the Triple Eviction Night was previously used on &quot;Big Brother Canada&quot; with a different format – where a single live round was played, with three nominees and two Houseguests being evicted within a single round.

Another variant is Eviction Competition, as seen in seasons 14 and 18, in which HouseGuests compete in a series of competitions for survival in the House, and the HouseGuest who finished last may face automatic eviction; if it is a team competition, all the members from the losing team are eligible for eviction as if they are nominated. An Eviction Competition was also proposed as a twist in the premiere of season 19 but was not held as the majority opted for an eviction vote instead of a competition.

====Jury====
The Big Brother Jury, as stated above, plays a key role in voting for the winner of the season between the Final Two HouseGuests.

=====First Format=====
The first format, used in seasons 2 and 3, featured all evicted HouseGuests, except for those who either walked or were expelled, that became eligible to vote.

Before the final votes could be made, each of the evicted HouseGuests asked one question apiece to the Final Two, who can only hear their voices but do not see them, in determining how they might vote for them, after which each of the Final Two HouseGuests made their final appeal. Then, each evicted HouseGuest chose a gold key from its own set of two, each one representing a vote for one of the two HouseGuests that they wanted to win (versus stating their choice to evict, as in all other votes), and then inserted that chosen key into one of twelve slots on the Voting Box. Then, before the evicted HouseGuests reveal their votes (as it was only seen in season 2), each of the Final Two had one last chance to change its outcome by choosing to eliminate one of the keys from the box, thus nullifying that evicted HouseGuest&#x27;s vote; the Final Two had to make their choices carefully without any knowing of how anyone voted. The rest of the keys were then pulled from the box, one by one, by the remaining evicted HouseGuests, each revealing their choice to win; the evictees revealed their votes in no-particular order in season 2, then in order of their eviction in season 3. The HouseGuest that received the most votes from the evictees, after all the votes have been revealed regardless of outcome, was then officially declared the winner of &quot;Big Brother&quot; and received the grand prize.

=====Second Format=====
Due to the possibility of a tie and a vote from the American public would be decisive during the first format, the Jury was revamped to its current form, allowing only the seven recently evicted HouseGuests (also known as the &quot;Jury of Seven&quot;), beginning in season 4, before increasing that number to nine (the &quot;Jury of Nine&quot;), beginning in season 15; the &quot;Jury Phase&quot; gets underway about halfway through the game. In this Jury Phase, the evicted HouseGuests (now known as the &quot;Jury Members&quot;) get to live in a very different house (the &quot;Jury House&quot;); while in the Jury House, the Jury Members saw all group events and competitions but, unlike what had occurred in season 3, are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any other footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.

Before they leave the Jury House, they get to participate in what&#x27;s called the &quot;Jury Roundtable&quot;, in which they debate the overall gameplay of the remaining HouseGuests. Prior to the start of Finale Night, the Jury Members were asked, as a group, to come up with (and agree on) three questions for each of the Final Two HouseGuests. After they were brought back to the studio, the Jury Members then, one at a time, asked one of those questions assigned to that finalist, with the exception of the last recently evicted HouseGuest, who can ask only one to either finalist; prior to season 11, while they were still in the Jury House, all the Jury Members, including the third-place finisher, asked one question apiece to either finalist. After the interrogation is complete, each of the two finalists made their final plea on why they deserve to win. Then, one by one, in order of their eviction, choosing from their own set of two, each of the Jury Members securely inserted the key with the name of the HouseGuest that they want to win into the slots on the Voting Box, providing a final brief statement to any one of the Final Two before doing so without giving away their decision. Then, after a few moments (with all of the early evictees returning, including any of them that have walked but not the expelled ones), the host pulls out the keys from the box revealing whom each Jury Member chose to win; in season 4, however, the Jury Members themselves pulled the keys, as part of a slight modification of the first Jury format, continuing until all the Jury&#x27;s votes were revealed regardless of outcome. The HouseGuest that received at least 5 votes from the Jury (4 votes prior to season 15) is then officially declared the winner of &quot;Big Brother&quot; and receives the grand prize.

Any HouseGuest who either walked or got expelled once the game has reached the Jury Phase results in the loss of a Jury Member; in this situation, the American public would be serving as a juror in their place.

Usually because of twists, the current nine-member Jury format can change back to the original seven-member format, along with the &quot;four-votes-to-win&quot; requirement, as it was done in seasons 25 and 26.

====Twists====
To keep the series intriguing, each season typically features a new twist to the format of the game. This began in season 3 with the famous &quot;Expect the Unexpected&quot; twist; the show would later adopt the &quot;Expect the Unexpected&quot; saying as its official motto.

Other seasons featured smaller twists that have had a smaller impact on the game, usually affecting a single week. The most notable example was &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, a twist that originated in season 11. The twist sees the Head of Household for that week being tempted by the box and can choose to either open the box or leave it. Should that Head of Household choose to open it, either good or bad consequences could be unleashed, which would cause an impact on all HouseGuests. Similar variants have been applied in later seasons, such as the &quot;Den of Temptation&quot; introduced in season 19 and the &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot;, introduced in season 7, which allowed the holder, determined by a vote from the American public and must be kept a secret until it is revealed in either one of the next two eviction nights, to overthrow the reigning H.O.H. and remove one or both nominees from the block on the given eviction night, as well as choose who is nominated in their place.

In some seasons, such as seasons 8, 10 and 16, the American public voted for a set of HouseGuests who would work with them. On each pre-determined period throughout the entire season, the public voted for one of usually two possible actions the HouseGuests would want to perform, and HouseGuests would earn prize money if they were able to complete the action.

Many seasons have featured twists in which evicted HouseGuests (except for those who either walked or were expelled) can win re-entry into the House, either by a public vote or special competition. Normally, this involves sequestering each evicted HouseGuest individually or in the Jury House (depending on whether the twist occurred pre-Jury or post-Jury, respectively).

====America&#x27;s Favorite HouseGuest====
Since season 7, viewers of the show vote to determine the winner of a special award called &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite HouseGuest&quot; in every season except for season 8 and the &quot;Over-the-Top&quot; spin-off; the winner of that award also receives a cash prize of $50,000 ($25,000 prior to season 23). The results are announced following the finale of each respective season.

During its debut, the award was only eligible to the Jury of Seven (hence the award was called &quot;America&#x27;s Choice Jury Prize&quot;), before expanding the eligibility to all HouseGuests (including the season&#x27;s winner, with the exception of any HouseGuests who either walked or were expelled), beginning in season 11. The voting percentages were revealed live until dropped in season 17.

Jeff Schroeder, who participated in seasons 11 and 13, is the only HouseGuest to have won the award twice. In addition, Taylor Hale, who participated in and won season 24, is the only &quot;Big Brother&quot; winner to have also won the award to date.

==History==
===Series===
The series was bought by CBS in early 2000 for an estimated $20 million. The American version of the series officially premiered on July 5, 2000, when the original ten housemates entered the house.

Since its inception, the show has been hosted by television personality Julie Chen Moonves.

It is produced by Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan for Fly on the Wall Entertainment and Endemol Shine North America (formerly Endemol USA). The success of the series has spawned several spin-offs. The series airs once a year, during the summer, except for the ninth season, which aired in the spring of 2008, and the &quot;Over the Top&quot; spin-off series broadcasting in fall 2016. Currently, 26 seasons of the show have aired, along with one digital season.

The show has aired a total of 936 episodes as of October 13, 2024 (not counting the celebrity editions and &quot;Over the Top&quot; since it premiered, with the September 5, 2013, airing marking the 500th episode. To date, there have been a total of 353 Houseguests compete in the series.

In an effort to promote diversity, CBS announced a new rule for &quot;Big Brother&quot; that 50% of all contestants must be for the 2021–2022 broadcast season and from this point forward.

===Companion shows===
Since its premiere, there have been numerous companion programs about the show. In 2004, the web series &quot;House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show&quot; (2004–2008) began airing. The series, which lasted for thirty minutes and aired on weeknights, allowed fans to call in and discuss the events of the game. This made &quot;House Calls&quot; the first live Internet talk show produced exclusively for a television network. The series was initially hosted by Gretchen Massey and Season 3 House Guest Marcellas Reynolds during its first two seasons. Beginning with the show&#x27;s third season, a new co-host was featured on the series each day, with some returning more than once.

During the show&#x27;s fifth and sixth seasons, each co-host was given a designated day of the week to host alongside Gretchen. Following the show&#x27;s sixth season, it was confirmed that it would not be renewed. &quot;Big Brother: After Dark&quot;, a second companion series, was debuted in 2007 and aired on Showtime 2 nightly from 12:00 midnight-3:00 am Eastern Time. The series continued this schedule until 2013, at which point it was moved to TVGN (now Pop), where it remained until 2019. Former House Guest Jeff Schroeder began hosting the &quot;Big Brother: Live Chat&quot; online discussion show in 2012, where he interviewed the House Guests both before they enter the house and following their evictions. He also performed post-finale backyard interviews with the cast. On August 10, 2017, Schroeder announced that he was moving to Colorado and would no longer be able to do the interviews.

For &quot;Big Brother 20,&quot; the &quot;Live Chat&quot; was replaced by &quot;Off the Block with Ross and Marissa.&quot; Hosted by former Celebrity House Guests Marissa Jaret Winokur and Ross Mathews, the show aired on Fridays on Facebook following the live eviction; however, it did not return for &quot;Big Brother 21&quot;.

===Spin-offs===

There have been three spin-off editions of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In October 2016, CBS premiered a spin-off web series, &quot;Big Brother: Over the Top,&quot; as an original series for CBS All Access. Unlike the flagship, television version, it was broadcast exclusively online with a shorter, 10-week season.

The second spin-off, &quot;Celebrity Big Brother,&quot; aired its first season on CBS on February 7, 2018. &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; was renewed for a second season, which premiered on January 21, 2019, and concluded on February 13. However, on January 1, 2020, CBS announced there would not be a &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in 2020. In September 2021, CBS announced that the celebrity edition of the show would be returning for a third season on February 2, 2022.

In November 2023, CBS announced that there would be a special holiday spin-off called &quot;Big Brother Reindeer Games&quot; set to air for six days across two weeks starting on December 11, 2023. The season would feature nine returning players (dubbed as &quot;The &quot;Big Brother&quot; Legends&quot;) and was entirely pre-taped and did not feature live feeds, nor did host Julie Chen Moonves return.

Though not actual spin-offs, both the English and French versions of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in Canada are, to date, the only franchises to fully adopt the American format; the 2020 revival of &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; also used the American format (in terms of nominations and evictions) but still relied on the Australian public to decide the eventual winner. Other global franchises, such as &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot;, have also adopted individual elements of the American format while still maintaining the international public vote format for weekly evictions and final vote.

===Broadcast===
Since its launch in the United States, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has aired on CBS. The show is simulcast in Canada on Global. The fourth and ninth seasons have both aired in the United Kingdom, the latter airing in the Spring season.

The first season featured a total of six episodes per week, though all future installments would air three nights per week. Of these three episodes, the weekly eviction episode is the only one that is live; this is the only episode to feature host Julie Chen Moonves. This show generally airs on Thursdays. To date, there have been a total of 820 episodes of the series to air. With the exception of the ninth season, the series typically airs once a year during the summer season.

&quot;Big Brother&quot; was the final primetime show to make the switch to high-definition television: the first 15 seasons aired in standard definition, with the sixteenth season being the first to be produced in HDTV. However, the live internet feeds would not broadcast in HD until &quot;Big Brother 17&quot;. Before the series made the transfer, it was the last remaining regularly scheduled prime-time series to remain in standard definition.

CBS released the entire third season as a nine-disc set on Region 1 DVD. This made it the first season to receive an official release, and has since become a rare item to find. The fourth season saw the release of a two-disc highlights DVD, featuring previously unseen footage deemed too racy for the main broadcast. To date, these are the only seasons to see a physical release.

Beginning with the seventh season, all future seasons are available for purchase on digital retail sites. With the 15th season, TVGN (now Pop) began airing re-runs of the series at later dates, making it the first season to be aired following its premiere; this continued with the 16th season. Subscribers to CBS All Access are able to stream the complete run of &quot;Big Brother&quot;—including the differently-formatted first season—and an episode of &quot;Big Brother 2&quot; that did not air in most markets due to ongoing coverage of the September 11 attacks. CBS aired the spin-off series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; from February 7–25, 2018. It was the first spin-off to air on the broadcast network and the second season overall to air in the winter television season (the other being season 9). The celebrity edition aired in a concentrated run with fewer episodes, but with multiple episodes each week.

====Live Internet feeds====
One of the main aspects of the series is the live feeds, in which viewers can view inside the house at any time. The live feeds have been a part of the series since its inception, initially being offered as a free service during the first season. From the second season onward, a subscription to the live feeds has been required, with the price ranging each year. The first season&#x27;s feeds were available on the show&#x27;s official site, hosted by AOL. From the second season to the 14th season, the feeds were available through RealNetworks either as a subscription or as a free addition for Gold members.

Since 2016, the live feeds have aired on CBS All Access (known as Paramount+ since March 2021), again requiring a subscription from users. Though advertised as being available at any time, the feeds are shut off during the weekly nomination ceremony, Power of Veto ceremony, and the competitions and evictions for that week; this is to provide suspense for the series. Slanderous statements and singing of copyrighted music are also blocked for legal reasons.

In 2023, the live feeds launched on Pluto TV with limited commercial interruption, marking the first time they have been offered for free since the first season.

==Series overview==


==Critical responses==
Since its inception, &quot;Big Brother&quot; has been criticized following reports of &quot;HIB&quot; (Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying), violence in the house, obscene language, breach of integrity, and the physical and mental strain of appearing on the series. Several seasons have also been criticized for racism and discrimination, most notably season 15 and season 21.

On September 9, 2018, Chen&#x27;s husband, Les Moonves, resigned as President of CBS after a second wave of reports of sexual misconduct allegations against him. On September 13, Chen closed out that evening&#x27;s episode by saying, &quot;From outside the Big Brother house with Brent, I&#x27;m Julie Chen Moonves. Good night.&quot; As Chen had previously never used Moonves professionally, many saw the move as Chen standing in solidarity with her husband. Following her resignation from &quot;The Talk&quot; on September 18 after eight years as co-host, there was speculation on whether Chen would continue as host of &quot;Big Brother&quot;. Chen did return to host the following year, and has become increasingly spiritual and religious on and off the program in the wake of such revelations.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Big Brother&quot; was nominated for Best Competition Show at the 2023 MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards.

<doc id="860921" wikidata="Q273617" url="?curid=860921" title="Ankylosauria">
<text>Ankylosauria is a group of herbivorous dinosaurs of the clade Ornithischia. It includes the great majority of dinosaurs with armor in the form of bony osteoderms, similar to turtles. Ankylosaurs were bulky quadrupeds, with short, powerful limbs. They are known to have first appeared in North Africa during the Middle Jurassic, and persisted until the end of the Late Cretaceous. The two main families of ankylosaurians, Nodosauridae and Ankylosauridae are primarily known from the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe and Asia), but the more basal Parankylosauria are known from southern Gondwana (South America, Australia and Antarctica) during the Cretaceous.

Ankylosauria was first named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1923. In the Linnaean classification system, the group is usually considered either a suborder or an infraorder. It is contained within the group Thyreophora, which also includes the stegosaurs, armored dinosaurs known for their combination of plates and spikes.

== Etymology ==
The name of this group of dinosaurs is associated with a number of anatomical features in which small and large bony shields fused together, completely covering their back and sides. On the skull these shields fused with the underlying bones, and the dorsal ribs fit snugly to the vertebrae. The Latin name Ankylosauria is derived from the Greek ἀγκύλος [ankylos] — &quot;curved&quot;, &quot;bent&quot; with the anatomical meaning &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;fused&quot; and σαῦρος [sauros] — &quot;lizard&quot;.

In the 1908 description of the genus Ankylosaurus, Barnum Brown described the family Ankylosauridae as a group of representatives with a &quot;rigid spine&quot;, but noted the wide, curved shape of the ribs, suggesting a &quot;strongly curved&quot; back (an error based on the alleged similarity to stegosaurs and glyptodonts, as ankylosaurs have flat backs). Therefore, &quot;rigid lizard&quot; and &quot;curved lizard&quot; could be additional meanings applied to the name of ankylosaurs.

==Classification==
Ankylosauria and Stegosauria together form the two major subgroups of Thyreophora, a group of armoured dinosaurs distinct from ornithopods and marginocephalians. Historically used for forms lacking large vertical plates, Kenneth Carpenter proposed in 1997 the first informal definition of the group, as all ornithischians closer to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; than &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. This definition was further refined by Paul Sereno in 2005 to specify &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot; and &quot;Stegosaurus stenops&quot;, the type species of both genera, a definition that was followed by Madzia and colleagues in 2021 when the group name and definition was formalized following the PhyloCode. Phylogenetic and morphological studies have differed on the inclusion of certain early taxa into Ankylosauria, especially the armoured Early Jurassic form &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot;. As some analyses, like that of Carpenter from 2001 or David B. Norman in 2021 find &quot;Scelidosaurus&quot; and possibly other early forms like &quot;Emausaurus&quot; and &quot;Scutellosaurus&quot; to fall closer to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; than &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, Carpenter and later Norman suggested redefining Ankylosauria to limit it to the two subclades Nodosauridae and Ankylosauridae, creating the new clade Ankylosauromorpha for all taxa closer to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; than &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. However, as historically even these primitive forms were considered ankylosaurs if they were more derived than &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, Madzia and colleagues considered a redefinition of Ankylosauria to be undesirable, instead preferring to abandon Ankylosauromorpha as a same-definition junior synonym of Ankylosauria. The clade Euankylosauria was named by Soto-Acuña and colleagues in 2021 in their description of a unique basal ankylosaur &quot;Stegouros&quot; to represent the grouping uniting ankylosaurids and nodosaurids, to the exclusion of their newly discovered clade Parankylosauria. This clade is formally defined in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; as &quot;the largest clade containing &quot;Ankylosaurus magniventris&quot; and &quot;Nodosaurus textilis&quot;, but not &quot;Stegouros elengassen&quot;&quot;.


A 2023 review of Thyreophora rejects the traditional Ankylosauridae-Nodosauridae split, instead finding &quot;nodosaurids&quot; to be referrable to three separate families: Panoplosauridae, Polacanthidae, and Struthiosauridae.


===Evolution===
The origin of ankylosaurs is poorly understood, and only a few specimens from the Middle Jurassic are known. The ancestry of ankylosaurs has long been sought among stegosaurs, the closest group to ankylosaurs compared to other dinosaurs. Currently, ankylosaurs are a close group of stegosaurs within the Eurypoda clade. They are united by the presence of osteoderms in the skin, the narrow triangular skull of stegosaurs is similar to that of nodosaurids, and some similarity is found in the structure of the palate. Since stegosaurs are known from the Middle Jurassic, ankylosaurs are probably of the same age. They may have split up during the Aalenian period, more than 170 million years ago, but they were definitely in Africa by the Bathonian due to the presence of &quot;Spicomellus&quot; in Morocco. There are no well-preserved remains of ankylosaurs of that age. An incomplete radius and ulna from the Isle of Skye in Scotland are known, the exact affiliation of which to ankylosaurs or stegosaurs is not established. Most likely, ankylosaurs followed a different evolutionary path than stegosaurs, although it is unknown when and how they split off. In the latter, the osteoderms become raised, and the lateral protection disappears. Ankylosaurs evolved towards the development of osteoderms on the surface of the skull, increased armor and further consolidation of the carapace, which suggests that the ancestor of the carapace consisted of separate non-fused osteoderms.

==Paleobiology==

Possible neonate-sized ankylosaur fossils have been documented in the scientific literature.

===Armor===
All ankylosaurians had armor over much of their bodies, mostly scutes and nodules, with large spines in some cases. The scutes, or plates, are rectangular to oval objects organized in transverse (side to side) rows, often with keels on the upper surface. Smaller nodules and plates filled in the open spaces between large plates. In all three groups, the first two rows of plates tend to form a sort of half-ring around the neck; in nodosaurids, this comes from adjacent plates fusing with each other (and there is a third row as well), while ankylosaurids usually have the plates fused to the top of another band of bone. The skull has armor plastered on to it, including a distinctive piece on the outside-rear of the lower jaw.

===Diet and feeding===
Ankylosaurs were built low to the ground, typically one foot off the ground surface. They had small, triangular teeth that were loosely packed, similar to stegosaurs. The large hyoid bones left in skeletons indicates that they had long, flexible tongues. They also had a large, side secondary palate. This means that they could breathe while chewing, unlike crocodiles. Their expanded gut region suggests the use of fermentation to digest their food, using symbiotic bacteria and gut flora. Their diet likely consisted of ferns, cycads, and angiosperms. Mallon et al. (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that ankylosaurs were generally restricted to feeding on vegetation at, or below, the height of 1 meter.

===Vocalization===
In February 2023, scientists reported that the possible sounds ankylosaurs may have made were bird-like vocalizations based on a finding of a fossilized larynx from the ankylosaur &quot;Pinacosaurus grangeri&quot;.

<doc id="860923" wikidata="Q669266" url="?curid=860923" title="Mike Curb">
<text>Michael Curb (born December 24, 1944) is an American politician, record executive, philanthropist, and former politician who served as the 42nd lieutenant governor of California from 1979 to 1983. He is the founder of Curb Records and is the chairman of Word Entertainment. He was inducted into the West Coast Stock Car Hall of Fame in 2006. A member of the Republican Party, Curb is the most recent Republican to be elected Lieutenant Governor of California as of 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Curb was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Charles McCloud Curb and Stella &quot;Stout&quot; Curb. He grew up in Southern California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley. He has one sister. After attending Grant High School, he attended San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge). His maternal grandmother was of Mexican heritage.

==Career==

=== Music ===
In 1963 and at the age of 18, Curb formed Sidewalk Records and helped start the careers of multiple West Coast rock and roll artists. In 1969, his company merged with MGM Records. He became president of both MGM Records and Verve Records, which then formed Curb Records.

Curb scored the music for the short film &quot;Skaterdater&quot; (1965) as well as &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966), &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1967), &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1967), &quot;The Born Losers&quot; (1967) (the first of the &quot;Billy Jack&quot; films), &quot;Maryjane&quot; (1968), &quot;The Wild Racers&quot; (1968), &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; (1968), &quot;The Big Bounce&quot; (1969), &quot;The Sidehackers&quot; (1969) and &quot;Black Water Gold&quot; (1970). Curb has composed or supervised more than 50 film scores and written over 400 songs.

In 1969, he co-wrote a new theme for the TV series &quot;American Bandstand&quot;; the theme was used until 1974.
 Curb had a Top 40 pop song in early 1971. Its title was the same as that of his album, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, which was written and composed by Lalo Schifrin and Mike Curb. The song was used as the theme of Brian G. Hutton&#x27;s film &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which starred Clint Eastwood. The song reached No. 1 in South Africa and New Zealand.

Mike Curb&#x27;s group, The Mike Curb Congregation, had the adult contemporary song &quot;Sweet Gingerbread Man,&quot; which was from the film &quot;The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart,&quot; on music charts in 1970. The group collaborated with the Sherman Brothers on the composition &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World,&quot; which reached the Top Ten &quot;Billboard&quot; AC in 1973. Also in 1970, they performed &quot;I Was Born In Love With You,&quot; the theme song of &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; as the title song for Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Dingus Magee&quot;. The group was featured on Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit of 1972, &quot;The Candy Man&quot; (the Aubrey Woods version was featured in the film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;). They sang backup on Jud Strunk&#x27;s 1973 hit &quot;Daisy a Day&quot;. The group was featured regularly on Glen Campbell&#x27;s CBS television show.

In 1969, Curb signed Christian rock pioneer Larry Norman, DeGarmo &amp; Key, 2nd Chapter of Acts, and Debby Boone - artists considered to be the earliest contemporary Christian music artists. Curb wrote and produced music for the Hanna-Barbera animated series &quot;Cattanooga Cats&quot;. The theme for the cartoon series &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; is credited to Mike Curb and the Curbstones.

In the 1970s, Curb wrote and produced for Roy Orbison, Marie Osmond and the Osmond Family, Lou Rawls, Sammy Davis Jr. and Solomon Burke. He also signed artists such as the Sylvers, Eric Burdon, War, Richie Havens, the Five Man Electrical Band, Gloria Gaynor, Johnny Bristol, Exile, The Four Seasons and the Dutch singer Heintje Simons and The Mob (Chicago band) to his labels.

Curb ran a short-lived country music subsidiary label for Motown called Hitsville Records. He co-wrote the lyrics for &quot;It Was a Good Time&quot;. He received BMI awards for composing &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; for Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and for composing &quot;All for the Love of Sunshine&quot;.

Curb served as chairman of the Inaugural Youth Concert for President Richard Nixon&#x27;s second term on January 20, 1973. He enlisted many artists from MGM records as well as others to perform for the historic event. Solomon Burke, The Mob, Jimmy Osmond, Tommy Roe, Ray Stevens, The Sylvers, The Don Costa Orchestra, and Laurie Lea Schaefer were on the stage for the young audience. He served as emcee for the program.

In 2021, Fisk Jubilee Singers won Grammy awards for &quot;Celebrating Fisk! (The 150th Anniversary Album)&quot; under Best Roots Gospel Album category. The album was produced for Curb Records: Mike Curb and Paul Kwami won a Grammy Award.

Curb Records marked its 60th anniversary in 2023, with Mike Curb still at the helm. Over the years, Curb Records has been home to Wynonna Judd, Tim McGraw, LeAnn Rimes, Hank Williams Jr., the Judds, Lyle Lovett, Natalie Grant, Ray Stevens, Rodney Atkins, Jo Dee Messina, Sawyer Brown, Lee Brice, Dylan Scott, Hannah Ellis, Harper Grace and For King &amp; Country.

===MGM anti-drug controversy===
in 1970, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Curb, as president of MGM Records, fired 18 acts for what Curb believed was their promotion of hard drugs in their songs. Curb said, &quot;Drug groups are the cancer of the industry. Their effect on young people who are their fans or followers is devastating. When they appear smashed out of their minds and describe musically a great experience they had on LSD, they are glorifying hard drugs. I credit hard drug record acts with hundreds and hundreds of new young drug users.&quot;

Curb has always disputed that any acts were dropped from MGM only for drug-related reasons. Billboard reported that Curb was alarmed by the drug-related deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Alan Wilson of Canned Heat. Among the musicians incorrectly thought to be included in the purge were The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa&#x27;s group The Mothers of Invention. Zappa, however, spoke out against drug use throughout his career and, by early 1969, had fulfilled his MGM/Verve contract and moved to his own Bizarre Records label, distributed by Warner Bros. The Velvet Underground had already left the label by then to sign with Atlantic Records, who released their fourth studio album &quot;Loaded&quot;. Also, when Eric Burdon, who was an advocate of psychedelics, dared Curb to release him from his contract although he was his biggest selling artist, Curb acquiesced. Burdon also launched a campaign—by distributing bumper stickers—called Curb the Clap.

Curb claimed industry support, and the record company official he cited was Bill Gallagher, the president of Paramount Records. Columbia Records president Clive Davis said Curb was &quot;grandstanding&quot;, and that his anti-drug stance had made him &quot;a minor hero of the Nixon administration.&quot; In 1997, Curb stated the affair had happened at a time when &quot;you were considered a freak if you spoke out against drugs.&quot;

===Political career===

Encouraged to enter politics in part by former Governor of California (and future President of the United States) Ronald Reagan, Curb was elected Lieutenant Governor of California in 1978, defeating the incumbent Democrat, Mervyn M. Dymally. Democratic candidate Jerry Brown was re-elected governor in the same year. During much 1979–1980, when Brown was out of the state campaigning to become the Democratic presidential candidate, Curb was acting governor, vetoing legislation, issuing executive orders, and making appointments. According to the December 28, 1979, edition of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;...the California Supreme Court ruled yesterday that when the governor is out of state, the lieutenant governor is free to exercise all powers of the chief executive...&quot;. 

Curb worked with liberal Democrat Harvey Milk on the campaign against the Briggs Initiative, a 1978 ballot initiative that would have banned gays and lesbians from working in public schools. Curb persuaded Reagan to oppose the initiative, and it was defeated. Curb continues to support LGBT rights; in 2023, Curb achieved a major victory in his challenge to Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, where the court declared it unconstitutional to force private businesses to post discriminatory LGBT signs. 

In 1982, Curb lost the Republican gubernatorial nomination to California Attorney General George Deukmejian. Deukmejian would go on to narrowly win the general election. In 1986, Curb ran again for lieutenant governor as the Republican nominee against the incumbent Democrat, Leo T. McCarthy, losing a bitterly contested race, largely run on the issue of punishment for drug trafficking and violent crimes. A vocal opponent of drug use, Curb advocated extension of the death penalty to include drug pushers whose narcotics trafficking resulted in a death. As of 2024, Curb is the last Republican to be elected to Lieutenant Governor of California to date, though another Republican, Abel Maldonado, has served as Lieutenant Governor since Curb left office. Maldonado was appointed by then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to fill a vacancy when the previous Lieutenant Governor, Democrat John Garamendi, resigned to take a congressional seat.

In 1980, Curb was co-chairman of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s successful presidential campaign. Curb was also chairman of the convention program in Detroit and was later appointed by Reagan to be chairman of the national finance committee.

===Involvement in car racing===
A motorsport enthusiast, Curb is a co-owner of the Curb Agajanian Performance Group, a team that has won ten national championships. His sponsorship and ownership have included three of NASCAR&#x27;s most celebrated drivers. He owned Richard Petty&#x27;s famed No. 43 car in 1984 and 1985, during which Petty achieved his 199th and 200th career wins. Curb was also a sponsor for Dale Earnhardt during his 1980 Winston Cup championship winning season, and sponsored Darrell Waltrip&#x27;s No. 12 Toyota Tundra in the Craftsman Truck Series, driven by Joey Miller in 2006. Curb-Agajanian also ran cars for many years in the Indianapolis 500, including for Dan Wheldon and Alexander Rossi, with whom he won the 2011 and 2016 Indianapolis 500s respectively. Curb was the co-owner with Richard Childress of the No. 98 Chevrolet driven by Austin Dillon. 

Curb was the only car owner to win in all 10 NASCAR auto racing series in the United States – the NASCAR Cup Series, the Xfinity Series (formerly the Nationwide series and Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series (formerly the Gander Outdoors Truck Series and Camping World Truck Series), the Grand-Am Rolex Daytona Prototype National Sports Car Series (now the IMSA SportsCar Championship merged with American Le Mans), the IMSA GT Series (formerly IMSA Camel GT), Continental Series (formerly IMSA GTS), the Late Model All American Series, the Modifieds and the K&amp;N East and West Series.

Curb is also a long-time sponsor of ThorSport Racing in the Truck Series, as part-owner of the team&#x27;s No. 98 Ford driven by Ty Majeski. He maintained a similar partnership with Phil Parsons Racing in the Cup Series, which also ran the No. 98. Parsons drivers Christopher Bell and Rico Abreu won the 2013 and 2014 USAC National Midget tours.

===Elvis House===
In 2006, Curb purchased a house at 1034 Audubon Drive, Memphis, which was once owned by Elvis Presley. Curb renovated the house and turned it over to the Mike Curb Institute at Rhodes College.

===Philanthropy and Honors===
In Nashville, Curb has become a civic leader and benefactor of Belmont University, where his donation toward the construction of a new arena resulted in it being named the Curb Event Center. The university includes the Mike Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business. Curb endowed the Curb Center and the Curb Creative Campus program at Vanderbilt University and the Mike Curb Institute of Music at Rhodes College in Memphis. In 2024, he made the largest ever donation to Belmont, contributing $58 million to expand the Curb College&#x27;s presence on Music Row.

In 2001, Curb was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame. Curb was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2003 and the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.

In August 2006, Curb pledged $10 million to California State University, Northridge (CSUN) (in Los Angeles) to endow his alma mater&#x27;s arts college and provide a lead gift for the university&#x27;s regional performing arts center. Of the $10 million gift, $5 million supported CSUN&#x27;s College of Arts, Media, and Communication, one of the university&#x27;s largest colleges that offers degree and certificate programs for more than 4,400 students. Of the gift, $4 million went into a general endowment for the college, and $1 million endowed a faculty chair specializing in music industry studies. As a result, the college was named in his honor. Studies with in the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication include Media, Arts, Music, Business, Journalism, and Communication Studies.

On June 29, 2007, Curb was honored with the 2,341st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

CSU Channel Islands dedicated the Mike Curb Studio in Napa Hall at the Camarillo, California campus on October 21, 2010. The studio is a post-production and film and video production facility.

In 2014, Curb was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee and in 2016, he was inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame. He was awarded Ray Fox Memorial Award of &quot;Living Legends of Auto Racing&quot; in Daytona in 2017. In 2018, Racers Reunion featured him in Men Who Changed Racing with Harry Miller and Sam Nunis. Curb was inducted to North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in the same year for his &quot;contributions and support of the Hall of Fame&quot;. In 2019, Curb received the National Centennial Leadership Award from Junior Achievement.

<text>A wind farm or wind park, or wind power plant, is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electricity. Wind farms vary in size from a small number of turbines to several hundred wind turbines covering an extensive area. Wind farms can be either onshore or offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the largest wind farm in the world, Gansu Wind Farm in China had a capacity of over 6,000 MW by 2012, with a goal of 20,000 MW by 2020. As of December 2020, the 1218 MW Hornsea Wind Farm in the UK is the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output.

Because they require no fuel, wind farms have less impact on the environment than many other forms of power generation and are often referred to as a good source of green energy. Wind farms have, however, been criticised for their visual impact and impact on the landscape. Typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to &quot;industrialization of the countryside&quot;, habitat loss, and a drop in tourism. Some critics claim that wind farms have adverse health effects, but most researchers consider these claims to be pseudoscience (see wind turbine syndrome). Wind farms can interfere with radar, although in most cases, according to the US Department of Energy, &quot;siting and other mitigations have resolved conflicts and allowed wind projects to co-exist effectively with radar&quot;.

== Siting considerations ==
Location is critical to the overall success of a wind farm. Additional conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electricity prices.

===Wind conditions===

The faster the average wind speed, the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are generally economically better for wind farm developments. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise there is a risk of damage. The average power in the wind is not proportional to the average wind speed. For this reason, the ideal wind conditions would be strong but consistent winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction.

Mountain passes are ideal locations for wind farms under these conditions. Mountain passes channel wind, blocked by mountains, through a tunnel like pass towards areas of lower pressure and flatter land. Passes used for wind farms like the San Gorgonio Pass and Altamont Pass are known for their abundant wind resource capacity and capability for large-scale wind farms. These types of passes were the first places in the 1980s to have heavily invested large-scale wind farms after approval for wind energy development by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. From these wind farms, developers learned much about turbulence and crowding effects of large-scale wind projects, which were previously unresearched, in the U.S. due to the lack of operational wind farms large enough to conduct these types of studies.

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a wind atlas, and validated with on-site wind measurements via long term or permanent meteorological-tower data using anemometers and wind vanes. Meteorological wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential in order to finance the project. Local winds are often monitored for a year or more, detailed wind maps are constructed, along with rigorous grid capability studies conducted, before any wind generators are installed.

The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings. At altitudes of thousands of feet/hundreds of metres above sea level, the power in the wind decreases proportional to the decrease in air density.

===Electricity grid considerations===

Often in heavily saturated energy markets, the first step in site selection for large-scale wind projects, before wind resource data collection, is finding areas with adequate available transfer capability (ATC). ATC is the measure of the remaining capacity in a transmission system available for further integration of two interconnected areas without significant upgrades to existing transmission lines and substations. Significant equipment upgrades have substantial costs, potentially undermining the viability of a project within a location, regardless of wind resource availability. Once a list of capable areas is constructed, the list is refined based on long term wind measurements, among other environmental or technical limiting factors such as proximity to load and land procurement.

Many independent system operators (ISOs) in the United States such as the California ISO and Midcontinent ISO use interconnection request queues to allow developers to propose a new generation for a specific given area and grid interconnection. These request queues have both deposit costs at the time of request and ongoing costs for the studies the ISO will make for up to years after the request was submitted to ascertain the viability of the interconnection due to factors such as ATC. Larger corporations who can afford to bid the most queues will most likely have market power as to which sites with the most resource and opportunity are eventually developed. After the deadline to request a place in the queue has passed, many firms will withdraw their requests after gauging the competition in order to make back some of the deposit for each request that is determined too risky in comparison to other larger firms&#x27; requests.

==Design==
===Turbine spacing===
A major factor in wind-farm design is the spacing between the turbines, both laterally and axially (with respect to the prevailing winds). The closer the turbines are together, the more the upwind turbines block wind from their rear neighbors (wake effect). However, spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and power cables, and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking, manufacturers require a minimum of 3.5 times the turbine&#x27;s rotor diameter of clear space between each adjacent turbine&#x27;s respective spatial envelope. 
Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated. Airflows slow as they approach an obstacle, known as the &#x27;blockage effect&#x27;, reducing available wind power by 2% for the turbines in front of other turbines.

== Onshore ==

The capacity of the world&#x27;s first wind farm was 0.6 MW, produced by 20 wind turbines rated at 30 kilowatts each, installed on the shoulder of Crotched Mountain in southern New Hampshire in December 1980.

 turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the topographic acceleration as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30 metres could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as &#x27;micro-siting&#x27;.

== Offshore ==
Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby) being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there were 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The European Wind Energy Association set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.

, The Walney Wind Farm in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 MW, followed by the London Array (630 MW) also in the UK.

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. Capacity factors (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.

The province of Ontario, Canada is pursuing several proposed locations in the Great Lakes, including the suspended Trillium Power Wind 1 approximately 20 km from shore and over 400 MW in size. Other Canadian projects include one on the Pacific west coast. In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast; and in late 2016 the Block Island Wind Farm was commissioned.Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. , there are 20 jackup vessels for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5 MW. Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines. Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.

== Experimental and proposed wind farms ==
Experimental wind farms consisting of a single wind turbine for testing purposes have been built. One such installation is Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field.

Airborne wind farms have been envisaged. Such wind farms are a group of airborne wind energy systems located close to each other connected to the grid at the same point.

Wind farms consisting of diverse wind turbines have been proposed in order to efficiently use wider ranges of wind speeds. Such wind farms are proposed to be projected under two criteria: maximization of the energy produced by the farm and minimization of its costs.

== By region ==

=== Australia ===

The Australian Greens have been significant supporters of Australian wind farms, however the party&#x27;s previous leader Bob Brown and former leader Richard Di Natale have now both expressed concerns about environmental aspects of wind turbines, particularly the potential danger they impose for birds.

=== Brazil ===

In July 2022 Brazil reached 22 GW of installed wind power in about 750 wind farms In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind China, USA and Germany. The largest wind farm in the country is the Complexo eólico Lagoa dos Ventos in the State of Piauí, onshore with a current capacity of 1,000 MW being expanded to 1,500 MW.

=== Canada ===

=== China ===

In just five years, China leapfrogged the rest of the world in wind energy production, going from 2,599 MW of capacity in 2006 to 62,733 MW at the end of 2011. However, the rapid growth outpaced China&#x27;s infrastructure and new construction slowed significantly in 2012.

At the end of 2009, wind power in China accounted for 25.1 gigawatts (GW) of electricity generating capacity, and China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country&#x27;s economy. With its large land mass and long coastline, China has exceptional wind resources. Researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua University have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power by 2030.By the end of 2008, at least 15 Chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components. Turbine sizes of 1.5 MW to 3 MW became common. Leading wind power companies in China were Goldwind, Dongfang Electric, and Sinovel along with most major foreign wind turbine manufacturers. China also increased production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines (80 MW) in 2008. Through all these developments, the Chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008, according to industry observers.

According to the Global Wind Energy Council, the development of wind energy in China, in terms of scale and rhythm, is unparalleled in the world. The National People&#x27;s Congress permanent committee passed a law that requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector.

=== Europe ===
In 2011 the European Union had a total installed wind capacity of 93,957 MW. Germany had the third-largest capacity in the world (after China and the United States), with an installed capacity of 29,060 MW at the end of 2011. Spain had 21,674 MW, and Italy and France each had between 6,000 and 7,000 MW. By January 2014, the UK installed capacity was 10,495 MW. But energy production can be different from capacity – in 2010, Spain had the highest European wind power production with 43 TWh compared to Germany&#x27;s 35 TWh. In addition to the &#x27;London Array&#x27;, an off-shore wind farm in the Thames Estuary in the United Kingdom, with a capacity of 630 MW (the world&#x27;s largest off-shore wind farm when built), other large wind farms in Europe include Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm near Constanța, Romania with 600 MW capacity, and Whitelee Wind Farm near Glasgow, Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW.

An important limiting factor of wind power is variable power generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of dispatchable generation capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a &quot;supergrid&quot; to connect national grids together across western Europe, ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world. The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will tend to be blowing somewhere.

In July 2022, Seagreen, the world&#x27;s deepest fixed-bottom wind farm, became operative. Located 26 miles off the Angus coastline, in Scotland, it has 114 turbines that generate 1.1 gigawatts (GW) of electricity.

===India===
India has the fifth largest installed wind power capacity in the world. As of 31 March 2014, the installed capacity of wind power was 21136.3 MW mainly spread across Tamil Nadu state (7253 MW). Wind power accounts nearly 8.5% of India&#x27;s total installed power generation capacity, and it generates 1.6% of the country&#x27;s power.

===Japan===
===Jordan===
The 117 MW Tafila Wind Farm in Jordan was inaugurated in December 2015, and is the first large scale wind farm project in the region.

=== Morocco ===
Morocco has undertaken a vast wind energy program, to support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the country. The Moroccan Integrated Wind Energy Project, spanning over a period of 10 years with a total investment estimated at $3.25 billion, will enable the country to bring the installed capacity, from wind energy, from 280 MW in 2010 to 2000 MW in 2020.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan. The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of the project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW. Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has built a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex is a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW was expected to be completed. The Pakistani government also issued a Letter Of Interest in a 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. The Pakistani government had plans to achieve electric power generation of up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down an energy shortage.

Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Company Limited 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Limited 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Limited 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Limited 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy) and were expected to achieve COD in 2017.

In the Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 &amp; II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Limited 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt. Limited 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.

===Philippines===

The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located in the northern part of the country&#x27;s biggest island, Luzon, alongside the seashore of Bangui, Ilocos Norte.

The wind farm uses 20 units of high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometre shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the South China Sea.

Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced apart, each high, with long blades, with a rotor diameter of and a wind swept area of . Phase II was completed in August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay.

Adjacent municipalities of Burgos and Pagudpud followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively.

Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the Pililla Wind Farm in Rizal and the Mindoro Wind Farm near Puerto Galera in Oriental Mindoro.

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France&#x27;s Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka was expected to build two 100MW wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in northern Sri Lanka.

===South Africa===

As of September 2015, a number of sizable wind farms have been constructed in South Africa mostly in the Western Cape region. These include the 100 MW Sere Wind Farm and the 138 MW Gouda Wind Facility.

Most future wind farms in South Africa are earmarked for locations along the Eastern Cape coastline. Eskom has constructed one small scale prototype windfarm at Klipheuwel in the Western Cape and another demonstrator site is near Darling with phase 1 completed. The first commercial wind farm, Coega Wind Farm in Port Elisabeth, was developed by the Belgian company Electrawinds.

=== United States ===

U.S. wind power installed capacity in September 2019 exceeded 100,125 MW and supplies 6.94% of the nation&#x27;s electricity. The majority of wind farms in the United States are located in the Central Plains, with slow expansion into other regions of the country.

Growth in 2008 channeled some $17 billion into the economy, positioning wind power as one of the leading sources of new power generation in the country, along with natural gas. Wind projects completed in 2008 accounted for about 42% of the entire new power-producing capacity added in the U.S. during the year.
Texas, with 27,036 MW of capacity, has the most installed wind power capacity of any U.S. state, followed by Iowa with 8,965 MW and Oklahoma with 8,072 MW. Iowa is the leading state in terms of wind energy accounting for nearly 40% of total energy production in 2019. The Alta Wind Energy Center (1,020 MW) in California is the nation&#x27;s largest wind farm in terms of capacity. Altamont Pass Wind Farm is the largest wind farm in the U.S. in terms of the number of individual turbines.

At the end of 2019, about 114,000 people were employed in the U.S. wind industry, and GE Energy was the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer. In 2018, US wind power provided enough electricity to power approximately 25 million homes, avoiding the emissions of 200 million tons of carbon.

== Impact on environment and landscape ==
== Health impact==

There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for &#x27;Wind Turbine Syndrome&#x27; causing vibroacoustic disease, although some suggest further research might still be useful.

In a 2009 report about &quot;Rural Wind Farms&quot;, a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighboring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbor) as a precautionary approach.

A 2014 paper suggests that the &#x27;Wind Turbine Syndrome&#x27; is mainly caused by the nocebo effect and other psychological mechanisms. Australian science magazine Cosmos states that although the symptoms are real for those who suffer from the condition, doctors need to first eliminate known causes (such as pre-existing cancers or thyroid disease) before reaching definitive conclusions with the caveat that new technologies often bring new, previously unknown health risks.

== Effect on power grid ==
Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.

The intermittent nature of wind power can pose complications for maintaining a stable power grid when wind farms provide a large percentage of electricity in any one region.

However wind farms are more resistant to military attack than thermal power plants as many missiles are needed to destroy them not just one.

== Ground radar interference ==
Wind farms can interfere with ground radar systems used for military, weather and air traffic control. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern. Actual aircraft and weather patterns around wind farms can be accurately detected, as there is no fundamental physical constraint preventing that, but aging radar infrastructure is significantly challenged with the task. The US military is using wind turbines on some bases, including Barstow near the radar test facility.

=== Effects ===
The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm&#x27;s turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning. Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration. Radar issues have stalled as much as 10,000 MW of projects in the USA.

Some very long range radars are not affected by wind farms.

=== Mitigation ===
Permanent problem solving include a &quot;non-initiation window&quot; to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm, and a similar method mitigates the false returns. England&#x27;s Newcastle Airport is using a short-term mitigation; to &quot;blank&quot; the turbines on the radar map with a software patch. Wind turbine blades using stealth technology are being developed to mitigate radar reflection problems for aviation. As well as stealth windfarms, the future development of infill radar systems could filter out the turbine interference.

A mobile radar system, the Lockheed Martin TPS-77, can distinguish between aircraft and wind turbines, and more than 170 TPS-77 radars are in use around the world.

The United States Federal Aviation Administration advises aircraft without position-reporting technologies such as transponders to avoid flight within at all altitudes from wind turbine farms.

== Radio reception interference ==

There are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities. Potential solutions include predictive interference modelling as a component of site selection.

== Impact on agriculture ==
A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.

In another study, an analysis carried out on corn and soybean crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.

<text>Polo is a brand of breath mint whose defining feature is the hole in the middle. The peppermint flavoured Polo was first manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1948, by employee John Bargewell at the Rowntree&#x27;s Factory, York, and a range of flavours followed. The name may derive from &quot;polar&quot;, referencing the cool, fresh taste of the mint. Polo mints are also sold in other countries such as India and Sri Lanka by Nestlé. Polo mints are usually sold in a 34g pack containing 23 individual mints.

== History ==
Polo mints were developed by Rowntree&#x27;s, after their war-time licence to manufacture Life Savers expired. Polo fruits followed soon afterward. Company legend is that the name is derived from &#x27;polar&#x27; and its implied cool freshness.

== Varieties ==
Over the years Rowntree and Nestlé have come up with variations of the original Polo mint. Some of these have been successes, whereas others have failed. None has been as successful as the original Polo mint.
* Spearmint: &quot;Cool look, cool taste.&quot; These Polos have a strong spearmint flavour and aroma. The original design of the sweets had turquoise flecks on them, and were mildly triboluminescent, but now are white.
* Fruit: These are boiled sweets in several fruit flavours, all in one tube. Flavours include strawberry, blackcurrant, orange, lemon, and lime.
* Polo Gummies: Fruit flavoured soft gummy sweets in the Polo shape.
* Sugar free: Sugar free version of the original Polo containing sorbitol.
* Mini Polos: Small Polos (about 0.5 cm in diameter) with a strong &quot;Super Mint&quot; minty flavour. They were packaged in a box shaped like a Polo Mint. They were also available in an Orange flavour.
* Smoothies: These creamy sweets came in flavours such as blackcurrant, sunshine fruits and strawberry.
* Citrus Sharp: Lemon and lime flavoured. Discontinued in the United Kingdom.
* Butter Mint Polos: mint flavour butterscotch.
* Strong/Extra Strong: &quot;We like them strong, but silent.&quot; A rival for Trebor, these were very hot. Discontinued in the United Kingdom.
* Ice: These came in a shiny blue wrapper, and had a cooler mint taste.
* Paan flavoured currently available in India since 2020
* Mint O Fruit: (available in Indonesia). These come in the following flavours: Raspberry Mint, Blackcurrant Mint, Peppermint, Lime Mint and Cherry Mint. These polos come with the following slogan &quot;Think Plong! Masih Ada Bolong!&quot; These are also sold in the United Kingdom in some Poundland stores.
* Holes: These were a plastic tube of small mints approximately, but not exactly, the size of the hole in a standard Polo mint.

Before this, Rowntree had already experimented with different Polos in the 1980s. Polo Fruits were always available, but they briefly made:
* Lemon: Similar to the citrus flavour that Nestlé put out around ten years later, but not identical.
* Orange: similar to Lemon, but in an orange packet.
* Tropical Fruit: included Banana, Melon, Coconut and others
* Globes : small capsules filled with mint flavoured liquid in a small box with a flip lid

== Description ==
A Polo is approximately in diameter and thick, with a -wide hole. The original Polo is white in colour with a hole in the middle, and the word &#x27;POLO&#x27; embossed twice on one flat side of the ring, hence the popular slogan &quot;The Mint with the Hole&quot;.

Ingredients of the main variety include sugar, glucose syrup, modified starch, stearic acid (of vegetable origin), and mint oils.

== Packaging ==

Polos are usually sold in individual packs of 23 mints, which measure about 10 cm tall. The tube of Polos is tightly wrapped with aluminium foil backed paper. A green and blue paper wrapper, with the word &#x27;POLO&#x27;, binds the foil wrapper, with the Os in &#x27;Polo&#x27; represented by images of the sweet. For the spearmint flavour, the paper wrapper is turquoise in colour, and the Extra Strong flavour is in a black paper wrapper.

== Trademarks ==
When the Trade Marks Act 1994 was introduced in the United Kingdom, Nestlé applied to register the shape of the Polo mint. The application featured a white, annular mint without any lettering. This application however was opposed by Kraft Foods, the then owner of Life Savers, and Mars UK, because of the lack of distinctive character of the mint in question.

Nestlé&#x27;s application was allowed to proceed if it agreed to narrow the description of the mint i.e. the dimensions of the mint were limited to the standard dimensions of the Polo mint and that it was limited to &quot;mint flavoured compressed confectionery&quot;.

Kraft Foods made a similar applications for annular sweets e.g. bearing the mark LIFESAVERS. Nestlé has tried to oppose this trademark application but failed as the court ruled that customers would be able to distinguish between a Polo and a Lifesaver as both have their marks boldly and prominently embossed on the mint.

== Advertising ==
During the 1980s, Peter Sallis provided the voiceover for television advertisements. With the launch of the spearmint variety, a new television campaign featured a voiceover by Danny John-Jules, using a voice similar to the one he employed as the Cat on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

In 1995, the company launched a major advertising campaign produced by Aardman Animations, which showed animated Polos on a factory production line. In one, a scared Polo without a hole attempts to escape, but is restrained by the hole punching machinery. Polo experimented with other forms of advertising in the end of the 1990s. In 1998, they collaborated with PolyGram for a compilation album, &quot;Cool Grooves&quot;, which reached No. 12 in the UK Compilation Chart on 5 September that year.

<text>Edward George Sherrin (18 February 1931 – 1 October 2007) was an English broadcaster, author and stage director. He qualified as a barrister and then worked in independent television before joining the BBC. He appeared in a variety of radio and television satirical shows and theatre shows, some of which he also directed and produced.

== Early life ==
Sherrin was born at Gawlers Farm, Low Ham, Somerset, the second son of smallholding farmer Thomas Adam Sherrin (1889–1965) and Dorothy Finch (née Drewett; 1895–1980). He was educated at Sexey&#x27;s School, in Bruton, Somerset, and rendered his national service in the Royal Signals, being commissioned as an officer in 1950.

Although he read law at Exeter College, Oxford, and subsequently qualified as a barrister (called to the bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn), he became involved in theatre at Oxford and joined British television in 1956 shortly after the founding of independent television, producing shows for ATV in Birmingham.

== Career ==
Sherrin joined the BBC in 1957 as a temporary production assistant, then began working for them as a producer in Television Talks in 1963. Specialising in satirical shows, he worked extensively in film production and television.

In 1962, Sherrin was responsible for the first satirical television series &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot; starring David Frost and Millicent Martin, and its successors &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot; and &quot;BBC-3&quot;. In 1990 he was a contestant on &quot;Cluedo&quot;, facing off against Thelma Barlow. His other shows and films included &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, &quot;Up the Front&quot;, &quot;The Cobblers of Umbridge&quot;, &quot;World in Ferment&quot;, and &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot;. In 1978, he also hosted &quot;We Interrupt This Week&quot;, a lively and humorous news events quiz featuring two teams of well-known journalists and columnists sparring against one another. The show was a production of WNET/Channel 13 New York.

Sherrin produced and directed many theatre productions in London&#x27;s West End, including &quot;Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell&quot; and the musical revue &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot;. He received an Olivier Award in 1984 for directing and conceiving &quot;The Ratepayers&#x27; Iolanthe&quot;, an adaptation by Sherrin and Alistair Beaton of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera &quot;Iolanthe&quot;. Sherrin played the part of Addison in the film &quot;Orlando&quot; released in 1992.

On BBC Radio 4, from 1986, Sherrin presented a light entertainment show on Saturday mornings (latterly evenings) called &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, and &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, a quiz show about all types of music, until forced off the air when his voice succumbed to throat cancer.

Sherrin also toured the UK with his one-man show &quot;An Evening of Theatrical Anecdotes&quot;.

Sherrin wrote two volumes of autobiography, several books of quotations and anecdotes, as well as some fiction; and several works in collaboration with Caryl Brahms.

== Personal life ==
Openly gay, Sherrin was a patron of the London Gay Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Stephen Sondheim Society of Singapore up until 1995. He was awarded a CBE in the 1997 New Year Honours. He was diagnosed with unilateral vocal cord paralysis in January 2007; this diagnosis was later changed to one of throat cancer, from which he died on 1 October 2007, aged 76.

<text>Bromus is a large genus of grasses, classified in its own tribe Bromeae. They are commonly known as bromes, brome grasses, cheat grasses or chess grasses. Estimates in the scientific literature of the number of species have ranged from 100 to 400, but plant taxonomists currently recognize around 160–170 species.

&quot;Bromus&quot; is part of the cool-season grass lineage (subfamily Pooideae), which includes about 3300 species. Within Pooideae, &quot;Bromus&quot; is classified in tribe Bromeae (it is the only genus in the tribe). &quot;Bromus&quot; is closely related to the wheat-grass lineage (tribe Triticeae) that includes such economically important genera as &quot;Triticum&quot; (wheat), &quot;Hordeum&quot; (barley) and &quot;Secale&quot; (rye).

== Etymology ==
The generic name &quot;Bromus&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;bromos&quot;, a borrowed word from the Ancient Greek (). and mean &quot;oats&quot;, but seems to have referred specifically to &quot;Avena sativa&quot; (Hippocrates &quot;On Regimen in Acute Diseases&quot; 2.43, Dioscorides Medicus 2.94, &quot;Polemo Historicus&quot; 88) and &quot;Avena barbata&quot; (Theophrastus &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; 8.9.2, Pseudo-Dioscorides 4.137). The generic name comes from , a native Latin word for &quot;oats&quot; or &quot;wild oats&quot;.

== Description ==
&quot;Bromus&quot; species occur in many habitats in temperate regions of the world, including Africa, America, Australia and Eurasia. There are considerable morphological differences between some species, while the morphological differences between others (usually those species that are closely related) are subtle and difficult to distinguish. As such, the taxonomy of the genus is complicated.

&quot;Bromus&quot; is distinguished from other grass genera by a combination of several morphological characteristics, including leaf sheaths that are closed (connate) for most of their length, awns that are usually inserted subapically, and hairy appendages on the ovary. The leaf blades and sheaths, which comprise the leaves can be hairless, sparsely hairy or hairy. The inflorescence is a dense or open panicle, usually drooping or nodding, sometimes spreading (as in Japanese brome, &quot;B. japonicus&quot;).

== Ecology ==
The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use &quot;Bromus&quot; as a foodplant, such as the chequered skipper (&quot;Carterocephalus palaemon&quot;).

== Uses ==
&quot;Bromus&quot; species are generally considered to have little economic value to humans, at least in present times. &quot;Bromus mango&quot; was historically cultivated in Chile and Argentina by indigenous peoples, who used it both as fodder and food. The Tarahumara Indians in northern Mexico use the grains of some native &quot;Bromus&quot; species to aid fermentation in making one of their cultural beverages. As names like poverty brome (&quot;B. sterilis&quot;) and ripgut brome (&quot;B. diandrus&quot;) attest, some species are not very useful as fodder because their leaves sclerotize quickly and may even be harmful to livestock due to the high silica content. Others, such as meadow brome (&quot;Bromus riparius&quot;), native to parts of Russia, are planted as forage in the Great Plains of North America. Brome grasses are not usually grown as ornamental plants due to most species&#x27; nondescript appearance. Some are useful to prevent erosion but such use must be cautiously controlled as most &quot;Bromus&quot; have the ability to spread, becoming invasive weeds. Cheatgrass (&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;) is a particularly troublesome weed across much of western North America (from southern British Columbia to California.)

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

Taxonomists have generated various classification schemes to reflect the morphological variation that is seen in &quot;Bromus&quot;. In North America, five morphologically similar groups of species, called sections, are generally recognized: &quot;Bromus&quot;, &quot;Genea&quot;, &quot;Ceratochloa&quot;, &quot;Neobromus&quot;, and &quot;Bromopsis&quot;. Sections &quot;Bromus&quot; and &quot;Genea&quot; are native to the Old World (Eurasia), but many species are introduced into North America. Sections &quot;Bromopsis&quot;, &quot;Neobromus&quot;, and &quot;Ceratochloa&quot; have several native species in North America.

<doc id="860937" wikidata="Q1544262" url="?curid=860937" title="Polo neck">
<text>A polo neck, roll-neck (South Africa), turtleneck (United States, Canada), or skivvy is a garment—usually a sweater—with a close-fitting collar that folds over and covers the neck. It can also refer to the type of neckline, the style of collar itself, or be used as an adjective (&quot;polo necked&quot;).

A simpler variant of the standard polo neck is the mock polo neck (or mock turtleneck), that resembles the polo neck with the soft fold at its top and the way it stands up around the neck, but both ends of the tube forming the collar are sewn to the neckline. This is mainly used to achieve the appearance of a polo neck where the fabric would fray, roll, or otherwise behave badly unless sewn. The mock polo neck clings to the neck smoothly, is easy to manufacture, and works well with a zip closure.

==History==
===Europe===
Turtle neck–like garments have been worn for hundreds of years, dating at least to the 15th century. They were originally designed to protect the necks of knights wearing chainmail. Royalty adopted high-neck fashion, with the height and volume of the neck ruffle indicating status.

From the late 19th century on polo necks were commonly worn by fishermen, manual workers, athletes, sailors and naval officers. Since the middle of that century, black polo necks have been closely associated with leftist radical academics, philosophers, artists and intellectuals. The polo neck jumper became an iconic symbol of the French philosopher Michel Foucault. Polo necks also became a big fashion for wealthy young men after they were worn by European film stars Marcello Mastroianni and Yves Montand.

Greta Garbo often wore polo necks and trousers privately, as later Audrey Hepburn would do in official photographs.

Vladimir Putin of Russia, Andreas Papandreou of Greece, and Emmanuel Macron of France are examples of European leaders who are fond of wearing polo necks.

===United States===
At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the high neckline blouse became a fashionable option for young women as part of the emergence of the Gibson Girl.
Their adoption by Noël Coward in the 1920s turned polo necks into a brief middle-class fashion trend, and feminists made them into a unisex item. Absorbed into mainstream American fashion by the mid 20th century, the polo neck came to be viewed as an anti-tie, a smart form of dress for those who rejected formal wear. Senator Ted Kennedy, pianist/conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy, conductor Seiji Ozawa, philosopher Michel Foucault, shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos, singer Barry Manilow, scientist Carl Sagan, Oracle Corporation co-founder Larry Ellison, and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs were among those often seen in polo necks. Disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes deliberately copied Steve Jobs&#x27; style in wearing a black polo neck.

Over time it became a fad among teenage girls, especially in a lightweight form that emphasised their figures. It was not long before Hollywood was also exploiting this image as part of the sweater girl look.

By the late 1950s the &quot;tight turtleneck&quot; had been adopted as part of the preppy style among students, a style emphasising neatness, tidiness and grooming. This would become an important aspect of the polo neck&#x27;s image in the United States.

Turtlenecks were also famous in hippies in 1960s and 1970s.

Very elegant polo necks of silk or nylon knit, especially made with French cuffs for formal dress affairs, have also seen success in American fashion.

==As an alternative to the necktie==
Polo necks have been used as substitutes for a shirt-and-tie since the 1920s. This was sometimes frowned upon in upscale restaurants and at weddings.

<text>The Singapore Management University (SMU) is a publicly funded private university in Singapore. Founded in 2000, SMU is the third oldest autonomous university in the country, modelling its education after the Wharton School. The university is triple accredited by AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA. In 2024, SMU was ranked 44th in the world for Business and Management Studies, while also placing in the top 100 for Economics and Finance by QS.

SMU enrols about 10,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, offering undergraduate and graduate degree programmes in accountancy, business administration, business analytics, economics, financial services, information systems, software engineering, law, and the social sciences. 

The university is organised into eight schools: School of Accountancy, Lee Kong Chian School of Business, School of Economics, School of Computing and Information Systems, Yong Pung How School of Law, School of Social Sciences, College of Integrative Studies and the College of Graduate Research Studies.

==History==
In 1997, the Government of Singapore began considering setting up a third university in Singapore. Ho Kwon Ping, a Singaporean business entrepreneur, was appointed to chair the task-force which determined that the new institution would follow the American university system featuring a more flexible broad-based education. Following a review of undergraduate business schools to serve as a model for SMU, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania emerged as the best candidate. The Wharton-SMU agreement was signed in February 1999 followed in June by the Wharton-SMU Research Center collaboration.

In July 1999, Janice Bellace, then Deputy Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, commenced a two-year term as SMU&#x27;s first president alongside founding provost, Tan Chin Tiong. In 2000, SMU made its first home at the former Raffles College (now the National University of Singapore&#x27;s Bukit Timah campus) on Evans Road near Hwa Chong Institution. The campus, first opened in 1929, had already been home to several institutions before SMU. In 2001, SMU upgraded and occupied the main campus facilities, balancing the need to refit and refurbish it with facilities while preserving the heritage of colonial architecture. From 2001 to 2004, Ronald Frank served as SMU&#x27;s second president and was succeeded by Howard Hunter.

Between 2000 and 2005, SMU saw the formation of four schools, its library and three centres of excellence as well as the graduation of the first batch of its students. After that, SMU moved from its Bukit Timah campus to its current campus in the Bugis-Bras Basah district. Since then, SMU has expanded, with the establishment of its School of Law in 2007 and the restructuring of its School of Economics and Social Sciences into two separate schools: the School of Economics and the School of Social Sciences.

In 2010, Yong Pung How and Arnoud De Meyer took over the positions of SMU Chancellor and President from Richard Hu and Howard Hunter respectively. and President In 2015, J. Y. Pillay replaced Yong as SMU&#x27;s Chancellor while Lily Kong succeeded De Meyer as SMU&#x27;s president in January 2019. Lim Chee Onn succeeded J. Y. Pillay as Chancellor in August that year.

==Academics==
SMU follows a course credit system similar to that used in most American universities. Each individual course within the university is assigned a certain credit weightage and students are usually required to take a specified number of units to fulfill requirements for graduation. Courses are typically conducted as small group seminars of under 50 students. Undergraduate students may be enrolled in second majors as well as double degrees.

===Admissions===
SMU admits students from a list of pre-university or high school qualifications that includes the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level, diplomas from the five polytechnics or two arts institutions and International Baccalaureate diploma once a year. For entry to graduate or master programmes, SMU requires GMAT and TOEFL or IELTS for most of the majors. Some majors also require submission of essays, recommendation letters, and a minimum work experience requirement. 

==Schools==

===School of Accountancy===
The School of Accountancy was launched in 2001 with the Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) undergraduate degree as its sole offering. In 2005, the school launched the Master of Professional Accounting (MPA) programme for professionals without undergraduate accounting qualifications.

Both the SMU MPA and BAcc are accredited with the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, Chartered Accountant Singapore, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), CPA Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia (ICAA) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).

===Lee Kong Chian School of Business===
The Lee Kong Chian School of Business was SMU&#x27;s first school, opening its doors to its pioneer batch of Bachelor of Business Management (BBM) students in August 2000. The school was named after the philanthropist Lee Kong Chian. In addition to its undergraduate offerings, the school offers masters degrees and PhDs.

===School of Economics===
The School of Economics was established in July 2002 as part of the then School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS). As of now, the SOE offers the Bachelor of Science (Economics) as well as Master of Science programmes in Economics and Applied Economics. In 2007, the School also introduced a PhD in Economics programme.

===School of Computing and Information Systems===
The School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS) was first formed as the School of Information Systems (SIS) with the aid of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 

In 2021, the school was rebranded as the School of Computing and Information Systems to reflect the larger focus on computing and software development in its offerings. Currently, the school offers four undergraduate degrees: Information Systems, Computer Science, Computing &amp; Law, and Software Engineering.

In addition to its bachelor&#x27;s degrees, SCIS also offers the Master of Science in Computer Science, Master of Philosophy in Information Systems, Master of IT in Business, the PhD in Information Systems/Computer Science and Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) programmes.

===Yong Pung How School of Law===

Originally named School of Law, the Yong Pung How School of Law (SOL) is SMU&#x27;s smallest school with an annual intake of around 180 students. The establishment of the SOL was announced in August 2007. Previously, the SOL existed as the Department of Law under SMU&#x27;s Lee Kong Chian School of Business, where it was chaired by Andrew Phang. Its current Dean is Lee Pey Woan, who succeeded Goh Yihan in 2022.

On 11 April 2021, SMU renamed the school to include former Chief Justice Yong Pung How&#x27;s name as a recognition for his founding contributions to the university.

The SOL offers the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) undergraduate programme, as well as a postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) programme. The school also offers a Master of Laws (LLM) programme, with the option of a dual LLM with Queen Mary University of London.

===School of Social Sciences===
The School of Social Sciences (SOSS) was established in July 2002 as part of the then School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS). Through a restructuring exercise in 2007, the School of Economics and School of Social Sciences were separated to form independent schools within SMU. The SOSS&#x27;s primary offering is the Bachelor of Social Science, a multi-disciplinary undergraduate programme. Within this programme, three main majors are offered, namely political science, psychology and sociology. In addition, the SOSS offers a PhD in Psychology.

===College of Integrative Studies===
The College of Integrative Studies (CIS) was formed in 2021 for interdisciplinary and integrative teaching and research. This is the first school in Singapore to offer an Individualised Major.

===College of Graduate Research Studies===
Like the CIS, the College of Graduate Research Studies (CGRS) also focuses on interdisciplinary programs.

==Professional education==
=== SMU Academy ===
SMU Academy offers programmes for working professionals, to provide continuous lifelong education through diplomas and certificate programs. This includes a combination of practical industry knowledge and general management skills.

=== SMU Executive Development ===
In addition to its traditional academic programmes, the university also runs executive education and development programmes for leaders at four stages of their career: emerging leaders, general managers, senior executives and corporate directors. These courses include Executive Skills for board members in Challenging Times; SNEF-SMU CEO Seminars: The Art &amp; Science of Productivity Leadership; and Johnson &amp; Johnson-SMU Hospital Management.

==Institutes and centres==
===Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship===

The Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship was established in 2009 and provides research, innovation and entrepreneurship training for the students of the university. In the same year, Business Innovations Generator, a start-up incubation programme was implemented. In 2017, the institute launched Protégé Ventures, a student-run venture fund and training program. The first in Southeast Asia, it gives undergraduate and postgraduate students from Singapore-based universities a practical, real-life venture capital experience in sourcing, analysing and investing in technology-enabled Asean startups with at least one student founder. 

The institute organises a major startup business competition called the Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition, which receives entries from a large number of international universities. In 2020, the competition received submissions from over 650 universities.

The tenth edition of the LKYGBPC launched the VC Office Hours, offering one-on-one consultations for founders by more than 30 senior partners from leading venture capital firms. Another highlight of the tenth edition was the Changemakers Conversations, a series of virtual panel discussions centred around themes such as &quot;Our New Normal&quot; and &quot;Growth in Asia&quot;.

<text>Up the Junction is a 1963 collection of short stories by Nell Dunn that depicts contemporary life in the industrial slums of Battersea and Clapham Junction.

The book uses colloquial speech, and its portrayal of petty thieving, sexual encounters, births, deaths and back-street abortion provided a view of life that was previously unrecognised by many people. The book won the 1963 John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize.

==Adaptations==
In 1965 it was adapted for television by the BBC as part of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; anthology series directed by Ken Loach.

A cinema film version followed in 1968 with a soundtrack by Manfred Mann.

The television version of the play was the inspiration for the 1979 Squeeze hit &quot;Up the Junction&quot;.

<text>Hobart Airport is an airport located in Cambridge, north-east of the Hobart central business district. It is the principal airport of Tasmania.

The federal government owned airport is operated by the Tasmanian Gateway Consortium under a 99-year lease.

The airport maintains a conjoined international and domestic terminal. The major airlines servicing the airport are Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia operating domestic flights predominantly to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. International flights to Auckland, New Zealand, operate two to three times weekly with Air New Zealand.

Due to the airport&#x27;s southern location, Skytraders operates regular flights to Antarctica on behalf of the Australian Antarctic Division using an Airbus A319.

Hobart International Airport was opened in 1956 and privatised in 1988. Occupying approximately of land, the airport is situated on a narrow peninsula. Take-offs and landings are inevitably directed over bodies of water regardless of approach or departure direction. The region immediately surrounding the airport remains largely unpopulated, which enables the airport to operate curfew-free services.

In the 2018–19 financial year, the airport handled 2.6 million passenger movements, making it the ninth busiest airport in Australia.

==History==
Prior to the existence of the airport, the region was served by Cambridge Airport, a small airport located close to the existing site. As air travel became more frequent and the number of flights increased, it was clear that Cambridge airport was only suitable for light aircraft. In June 1948, Prime Minister Ben Chifley announced the construction of a new AU£760,000 airport at Llanherne. With Australia&#x27;s continual interest in Antarctica, it was believed the southernmost airport of Australia would serve as an ideal base for heavy aircraft serving the region. Hobart Airport was commissioned in 1956 as the primary regular public transport airport. It was initially named Llanherne Airport, after the property on which it was built, but the name has since fallen into disuse. In its first full year of operation, the airport processed 120,086 passengers and 11,724 tonnes of freight, ranking fifth in Australia.

By 1957, the airport&#x27;s infrastructure comprised a small terminal building which remains at the south-eastern end of the current terminal, two freight hangars, a fuel depot, a timber weather station, and the airport administration office and works compound. In 1964, the Federal Government upgraded and lengthened the runway to cater for jet aircraft. The runway was extended again in 1985 to cater for large aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Antonov 124 (albeit to a limited operating range). The current domestic terminal building was officially opened on 28 July 1976 and the international terminal building in 1986. The Federal Government corporatised the airport in January 1988 with the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation.

===Privatisation===

In June 1998, Hobart Airport was privatised, with a 99-year lease purchased by a consortium of Hobart Ports Corporation, Hambros Australia and Airport Group International. In 2004, the domestic terminal was redeveloped for the first time in its 30-year history. This development involved modernising the terminal, moving the retail shops to within the security screening area, realignment of the car park and moving the car rental facilities to a new building in the car park. In 2005, Hobart Airport experienced record annual passenger numbers and it was decided to bring forward plans to upgrade the seating capacity of the airport. This work expanded the domestic terminal building over the tarmac by three metres to provide more departure lounge space.

In December 2007, the Tasmanian Government sold the TasPorts owned subsidiary for $350 million to the Tasmanian Gateway Consortium, a private consortium made up of Macquarie Capital (one of Macquarie Group&#x27;s infrastructure funds) and Tasmania&#x27;s public sector superannuation fund, the Tasplan. The sale was in line with other state capital airport sell-offs, and Hobart airport was the last capital city airport remaining under government control. In October 2019, Macquarie Capital sold its stake to Queensland Investment Corporation and Schiphol Group.

In February 2024, Hutchinson Builders began work to double the size of the terminal. In July 2024, work began to upgrade the runway to accommodate Airbus A350 and Boeing 787s. 

==Terminals==

Hobart Airport has two passenger terminals. In 2007, the two terminals were connected in a $15 million development to meet new Commonwealth legislation that requires all checked luggage to be X-rayed. In 2008, the airport received a commendation for public architecture at the Tasmanian Chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects, for the new terminal upgrade. The airport currently maintains a combined international, domestic and general aviation apron. Provisions have been made to create a dedicated general aviation apron to the south of the one currently in use. The 2022 draft masterplan confirms that the terminal building will be increasing in size from the current to around in the medium term.

===Domestic terminal===
The current domestic terminal was opened in 1976 and has been expanded several times since. All airlines share the same check in and departure area towards the south-eastern end of the building. A Qantas Club is located airside within the departures area, with provision for an expanded lounge for both Qantas and Virgin Australia in the master plan. The arrivals hall for all airlines is located at the north-western end of the building and contains two baggage carousels. The easternmost of the baggage carousels can be secured for use by international arrivals. The domestic apron has six parking bays for narrow-body (Boeing 737/Airbus A320-sized) aircraft, with three additional parking bays located toward the northern end of the domestic apron.

===International terminal===
The international terminal was opened in 1983 to facilitate Trans-Tasman air traffic, although, international flights began at the airport in December 1980 with Ansett and TAA offering services to New Zealand. In 1985 the terminal was upgraded, along with the runway, to provide limited 747 operations. Between 1998 and 2020, no regular international flights serviced the airport after Air New Zealand suspended their operations from Christchurch. Direct international flights recommenced in April, 2021 with Air New Zealand to Auckland operating twice weekly in winter and thrice weekly over summer. The terminal is also used by Skytraders for flights to Antarctica and occasional charter airline flights. The terminal&#x27;s apron has a single wide-body parking bay overlapping two narrow-body bays. This bay is able to accommodate large wide-body aircraft up to and including Boeing 747-400 and 777–200. The international terminal&#x27;s apron is used primarily for domestic operations and Skytraders&#x27; seasonal Antarctic flights as well as the Air New Zealand flights to Auckland.

===Freight===

There are two domestic freight areas operating at the airport, catering for Qantas, Toll Air and Virgin Australia. The facility includes two buildings on a total area of approximately , including the freight apron area. Qantas uses dedicated jet freight aircraft. In January 2007, Virgin Blue and Toll Air opened a dedicated freight facility to the north of the international terminal. This new freight area has no dedicated apron of its own, but rather makes use of the cargo holds of the passenger aircraft already serving the airport.

===General aviation===
The majority of Hobart&#x27;s general aviation traffic makes use of the nearby Cambridge Aerodrome, which was sold in 1992 on the condition that it remain an airport until 2004. Since that date, Hobart Airport has made plans for a large expansion catering for general aviation should the owners of Cambridge Aerodrome decide to use the land for other purposes. This expansion would include a new runway and a general aviation apron located south of the existing Domestic Terminal.

==Runway==

Hobart Airport has one runway, 12/30, which is aligned north–west to south–east and is . The runway was extended in 2017 by 500 metres comprising a 350-metre extension at the southern end, a 150-metre lengthening to the northern end, and the relocation of the approach lights. The high strength flexible runway is constructed with an asphaltic concrete surface and is suitable for all Code E aircraft operations up to and including Boeing 777/747 aircraft. The current runway length is adequate for unrestricted operations on a Boeing 787-9 to China and Japan. The runway conforms to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority&#x27;s standards.

In 2009, Hobart International Airport Pty Ltd announced detailed plans for the airport with a new 20-year master plan. Currently aircraft have to taxi along the runway and proceed to the parking apron via taxiways in the middle of the runway. This has both capacity and safety implications for the airport, as the runway cannot be used whilst an aircraft is taxiing. The plans provide for a parallel taxiway to the full length of runway. When complete, aircraft landing on the runway would proceed to the end of the runway and exit via the parallel taxiway. This would allow for greater utilisation of the existing runway.

The airport purchased land from the Tasmanian Government in the southern part of the airport for future development of operational facilities. This additional area would allow for a short runway for general aviation aircraft, either parallel to the main runway along the southern end of the eastern boundary of the airport, or a cross runway towards the southern end of the main runway. The alternative second runway would provide an opportunity to improve the operational management of the lighter categories of aircraft. However, the second runway is not likely to be developed any time soon, because the existing runway is under-utilised.

==Other facilities==
===Hotel===
In December 2005, prominent Hobart developer Ali Sultan proposed a four star, 60-room hotel/motel for the airport. The hotel, named the Quality Hotel Hobart Airport, was opened on 1 December 2008. The hotel comprises 78 rooms, a restaurant/café and a number of conference and meeting spaces. The hotel employs 25 people.

===Big box development===
Early in 2006, the airport announced plans to build a Direct Factory Outlet, covering an area of , which would have made it the largest of its kind in Australia. Austexx, a Melbourne-based company was the main investor in the $100 million project.

While the Tasmanian Government supported the project, believing the Direct Factory Outlet would drive retail trade growth, the Hobart City Council and a large amount of retail shop owners in the Hobart central business district expressed fears of losing business. Concern was also expressed about the big box being built on commonwealth land and therefore escaping the state planning laws. In 2008, plans for the project were submitted to the Federal Government for assessment. Federal Transport Minister Warren Truss gave approval on condition the outlet centre was cut by almost half to , prompting Austexx to walk away from the proposal. In February 2008, Austexx&#x27; chief executive Geoff Porz confirmed the Direct Factory Outlet and Homemaker Hub project was back on, however Austexx went into receivership in 2010, and as of 2024 the site remains undeveloped.

===Cold storage and warehousing===
In December 2018 Link Logistics International started a cold storage and warehousing facility at the Hobart Airport. The cool rooms have a height of eight metres, which is ideal for block stacking pallets. Since opening the cold storage, Link Logistics International Pty Ltd has provided temperature-controlled storage solutions for customers wanting short-term seasonal storage to long-term storage. Storage has been provided to the industry from various sectors, including seafood, viticulture, stone fruit, berries, vegetable processors, craft beer, poultry, wine, ice cream, and restaurateurs wanting a larger storage alternative.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

Qantas formerly operated dedicated &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; services over Antarctica from Hobart. These flights, which used a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, departed Hobart from the international/domestic terminal, and provided a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights were about thirteen hours in total.

=== Cargo ===
==Traffic and statistics==


==Ground transport==

Hobart Airport has a car park that caters for short, medium and long term parking. There is also a well-serviced taxi rank and limousine service operating at the airport. 
There are numerous car rental operators.

Public transport had not been a high use alternative to private transport for those travelling to and from the airport. A SkyBus service was launched in June 2018, which operates between the Hobart central business district and the airport. The shuttle departs outside the terminal every 30 minutes transferring passengers to the city.

<text>The All India Trinamool Congress (; AITC) is an Indian political party that is mainly influential in the state of West Bengal. It was founded by Mamata Banerjee on 1 January 1998 as a breakaway faction from the Indian National Congress and rapidly rose to prominence in the politics of West Bengal under her leadership. Presently, it is ruling the state of West Bengal beside being the third-largest party in India in terms of number of MPs just after the BJP and INC.

The party won a historic victory in the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election by defeating the 34-year-long Left Front rule, world&#x27;s longest democratically elected communist government. It has won a three-time majority in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly and has been the ruling party in West Bengal since 20 May 2011. AITC is led by Mamata Banerjee as the chairperson of the party.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
After being a member of the Indian National Congress (INC) for over 26 years, Mamata Banerjee quit the INC and established the TMC in 1998. The official election symbol of the TMC is &quot;Jora Ghas Phul&quot; (two flowers with grass). In the 1998 Lok Sabha polls, TMC won seven seats. In the next Lok Sabha election that was held in 1999, Trinamool Congress won eight seats with BJP, thus increasing its tally by one. In 2000, TMC won the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Elections.

The party initially joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), as part of the Vajpayee government, and was initially quite successful, winning seven seats in its first election in 1998. In the 2001 Vidhan Sabha elections, the TMC won 60 seats in alliance with the INC, becoming the principal opposition party. They suffered big losses in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and the 2006 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, and subsequently left the NDA.

=== Nandigram movement ===

In December 2006, the people of Nandigram were given notice by Haldia Development Authority that a major portion of Nandigram would be seized and 70,000 people be evicted from their homes to make way for a chemical plant. People started movement against this land acquisition and the TMC helped lead the movement. The Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee (&#x27;Committee against Land Evictions&#x27;; BUPC) was formed to protest against the eviction. On 14 March 2007, the police opened fire and killed 14 villagers and many more went missing. Many sources claimed (and which was supported by the Central Bureau of Investigation in its report) that armed Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadres, along with police, fired on protesters in Nandigram Many intellectuals protested in the streets and this incident gave birth to a new movement. Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) leader Nanda Patra led the movement. The events led to a significant backlash against the CPI(M) government, and were a major factor in the TMC&#x27;s success in the elections that followed.

=== Post-Nandigram/Singur elections ===

In the 2009 Lok Sabha election, TMC won 19 seats in West Bengal, in alliance with the Congress. They subsequently became a part of Manmohan Singh&#x27;s government, with Banerjee serving as Minister of Railways.

In the 2010 Kolkata municipal election, the party won 97 out of 141 seats. It also won a majority of other municipalities.

=== In government ===

In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, the TMC-led alliance that included the INC and SUCI(C) won 227 seats in the 294-seat legislature, defeating the incumbent Left Front government which had been in power for 34 years. TMC alone won 184 seats, enabling it to govern without an alliance. Subsequently, it won a by-election in Basirhat and two Congress MLAs switched to the TMC, giving it a total of 187 seats. Banerjee, an MP at the time, had not contested the election and had to transfer to the safe seat of Bhabanipur.

On 18 September 2012, Banerjee announced her decision to withdraw support to the UPA after the TMC&#x27;s demands to undo government-instituted changes including FDI in retail, increase in the price of diesel and limiting the number of subsidised cooking gas cylinders for households, were not met.

The 2014 Lok Sabha elections saw the TMC dominate the state, winning 34 out of the 42 seats. It also qualified for national party status, as the TMC had received 6% of the vote from five different states (West Bengal, Manipur, Tripura, Jharkhand and Assam). On 2 September 2016, the Election Commission recognised TMC as a national political party.

The party was reelected in the 2016 election to a supermajority government, and Banerjee continued as chief minister.

The party won the most seats in West Bengal in the 2019 Indian general election, but suffered significant losses to the Bharatiya Janata Party, which for the first time established itself as a major force in the state. After the election, the party&#x27;s status came under revision by the Election Commission of India, due to a loss in presence in most states outside West Bengal.

Banerjee&#x27;s government was reelected again in the 2021 state election by an unexpectedly large margin over the BJP. Prior to the election, several high-profile TMC members such as Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari had defected to the BJP. Despite the large winning margin, Banerjee was defeated by Adhikari in the Nandigram seat, where she had transferred to fight Adhikari head-on.

== Party symbols and slogans ==
The party name and election symbol represents &#x27;grassroots&#x27;– the name contains the Bengali word &quot;trinamool&quot;, which literally means grassroots, and the symbol is a sapling emerging from the ground. The symbol is known as &quot;Jora Ghas Phul&quot; (Bengali: grass and flower; two flowers with grass). The usage of &quot;All India&quot; in the party name represents the rejection of &quot;elitist&quot; Indian National Congress from which it broke apart from.

&quot;Ma Mati Manush&quot; () was primarily a slogan, coined by Mamata Banerjee. The term is literally translated as &quot;Mother, Motherland and People&quot;. The slogan became very popular in West Bengal at the time of the 2011 assembly election. Mamata Banerjee wrote a Bengali book with the same title. A song was also recorded with the same title.

The slogan Joy Bangla is also officially used by Mamata Banerjee and by her party Trinamool Congress as part of attempt to create a territorial and ethnolinguistic identity for Bengalis in India. It is used in particular, as a closing remark for political speeches.

In the 2021 assembly election, the party used a song &quot;&quot;Khela Hobe&quot; across the state. The song was penned by Debangshu Bhattacharya, a party youth wing member. The &quot;Khela Hobe&quot;&quot; term has been used across India by several opposition parties and to catalyse the movements against the establishment on multiple issues throughout the nation.

One of her paintings was also sold to Sudipto Sen (central figure in the Saradha scam) for , while 20 more of her pictures were seized from other Saradha Group shareholders. She has been criticised by opposition parties for not taking adequate steps against her own ministers who tried to cover-up their deeds. Sudipto Sen was arrested from Kashmir. The Shyamal Sen Commission, set up by the Chief Minister, was able to return to the depositors. Leaders from Congress and CPI(M) like Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Sujan Chakraborty, Biman Bose were also accused in this scam. Despite Bankshall Court&#x27;s order to investigate into this matter, no action has been taken by CBI against any of these leaders (other than TMC leaders) to date.

=== Rose Valley financial scandal ===

The Rose Valley financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal in India caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by Rose Valley Group where multiple MPs from Banerjee&#x27;s party were accused of money laundering.

=== 2016 Narada scam ===

The Narada sting operation was carried out by Mathew Samuel in 2011 for the Indian newsmagazine &quot;Tehelka&quot; and published on Naradanews.com just before the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections. The sting targeted high-ranking officials and politicians of Banerjee&#x27;s political party All India Trinamool Congress (AITC).

During her tenure she challenged the federal system of India when she ordered the arrest of CBI officials, who arrived in Kolkata to investigate the Saradha Group financial scandal. But CBI&#x27;s attempted arrest of Kolkata Police Commissioner was also an attack on federalism.

=== 2022 coal scam case ===
Rujira Banerjee, the wife of Abhishek Banerjee, the Lok Sabha member and national general secretary of the Trinamool Congress, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday after being prevented from boarding a flight to the UAE earlier this week due to a &quot;lookout&quot; notice issued by the central organisation. Rujira received a summons to appear before the organisation on 8 June when she arrived at the airport. She was questioned by the ED in relation to the coal theft case last year. She had previously been questioned by the CBI in the same matter in 2021.

According to officials, as quoted by the news agency PTI, Rujira appeared before the ED in Kolkata on Thursday for questioning about the coal theft case. Rujira was being questioned by a team of five officials, including those from New Delhi. In a money-laundering case related to a West Bengal coal scam, the Supreme Court of India on Tuesday stayed a Delhi High Court decision allowing the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to question Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee in Delhi, but allowed the investigation agency to question him in Kolkata after providing 24 hours&#x27; notice.

=== 2022 cattle smuggling case ===
Anubrata Mondal, a powerful member of the Trinamool Congress who was detained on 11 August, has been placed in the custody of the CBI until 20 August. On the evening of 11 August, Mondal was transferred from Asansol to the CBI office in Kolkata&#x27;s Nizam Palace, where he is currently being questioned.

Mondal is one of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee&#x27;s most dependable aides, and he was in charge of all TMC operations in Birbhum. The ongoing cross-border cattle smuggling case, which allegedly involves a connection between BSF, Customs, and police personnel with racketeers and politicians, has come back into the spotlight as a result of the arrest of the TMC strongman.

=== 2022 West Bengal School Service recruitment scam ===
West Bengal School Service recruitment scam is an ongoing education SSC scam in West Bengal, India since 2022. The scam is being currently investigated jointly by Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate. The scam was revealed, following the arrest of Partha Chatterjee, a Trinamool Congress leader, who has served as the Minister of Education in the Mamata Banerjee&#x27;s cabinet until his arrest on 23 July 2022.

=== Allegations of extortion ===
Before Trinamool (AITC) took office in West Bengal in 2011, the regional AITC party leaders grew significantly in strength. The leaders allegedly began requesting a portion of the funds used to construct any new buildings in the region. As time went on, various groups in various locations began to emerge and link with various local AITC leaders. The entire syndicate business is alleged to have prospered when AITC ultimately won the 2011 Legislative Assembly election and began their tenure.

<doc id="860964" wikidata="Q83280" url="?curid=860964" title="Pan-Turkism">
<text>Pan-Turkism () or Turkism () is a political movement that emerged during the 1880s among Turkic intellectuals who lived in the Russian region of Kazan (Tatarstan), South Caucasus (modern-day Azerbaijan) and the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey), with its aim being the cultural and political unification of all Turkic peoples. Turanism is a closely related movement but it is a more general term, because Turkism only applies to Turkic peoples. However, researchers and politicians who are steeped in the pan-Turkic ideology have used these terms interchangeably in many sources and works of literature.

Although many of the Turkic peoples share historical, cultural and linguistic roots, the rise of a pan-Turkic political movement is a phenomenon of the 19th and 20th centuries. Ottoman poet Ziya Gökalp defined pan-Turkism as a cultural, academic, and philosophical and political concept advocating the unity of Turkic peoples. Ideologically, it was premised on social Darwinism. Pan-Turkism has been characterized by pseudoscientific theories known as Pseudo-Turkology.

==Name==
In research literature, &quot;pan-Turkism&quot; is used to describe the political, cultural and ethnic unity of all Turkic people. &quot;Turkism&quot; began to be used with the prefix &quot;pan-&quot; (from the Greek πᾶν, pan = all).

Proponents use the latter as a point of comparison, since &quot;Turkic&quot; is a linguistic, ethnic and cultural distinction rather than a citizenship description. This differentiates it from &quot;Turkish&quot;, which is the term which is officially used in reference to citizens of Turkey. Pan-Turkic ideas and reunification movements have become popular since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Central Asian and other Turkic countries.

==History==
=== Development and spread ===
In 1804, the Tatar theologian Ghabdennasir Qursawi wrote a treatise calling for the modernization of Islam. Qursawi was a Jadid (from the Arabic word &quot;jadid&quot;, &quot;new&quot;). The Jadids encouraged critical thinking, supported education and advocated the equality of the sexes, advocated tolerance of other faiths, advocated Turkic cultural unity, and advocated openness to Europe’s cultural legacy. The Jadid movement was founded in 1843 in Kazan. Its aim was the implementation of a semi-secular modernization program and the implementation of an educational reform program, both programs would emphasize the national (rather than the religious) identity of the Turks. Before they founded their movement in 1843, the Jadids considered themselves Muslim subjects of the Russian Empire, a belief which they held until the Jadid movement disbanded.

After they joined the Wäisi movement, the Jadids advocated national liberation. After 1907, many supporters of Turkic unity immigrated to the Ottoman Empire.

The newspaper &quot;Türk&quot; in Cairo was published by exiles from the Ottoman Empire after the suspension of the Ottoman constitution of 1876 and the persecution of liberal intellectuals. It was the first publication to use the ethnic designation as its title. Yusuf Akçura published &quot;Three Types of Policy&quot; (&quot;Üç tarz-ı siyaset&quot;) anonymously in 1904, the earliest manifesto of a pan-Turkic nationalism. Akçura argued that the supra-ethnic union espoused by the Ottomans was unrealistic. The Pan-Islamic model had advantages, but Muslim populations were under colonial rule which would oppose unification. He concluded that an ethnic Turkish nation would require the cultivation of a national identity; a pan-Turkish empire would abandon the Balkans and Eastern Europe in favor of Central Asia. The first publication of &quot;Three Types of Policy&quot; had a negative reaction, but it became more influential by its third publication in 1911 in Istanbul. The Ottoman Empire had lost its African territory to the Kingdom of Italy and it would soon lose the Balkans. Pan-Turkish nationalism consequently became a more feasible (and popular) political strategy.

In 1908, the Committee of Union and Progress came to power in Ottoman Turkey, and the empire adopted a nationalistic ideology. This contrasted with its largely Muslim ideology which dated back to the 16th century, when the sultan was the caliph of his Muslim lands. Leaders who espoused Pan-Turkism fled from Russia and moved to Istanbul, where a strong pan-Turkic movement arose; the Turkish pan-Turkic movement grew and transformed itself into a nationalistic, ethnically oriented movement which sought to replace the caliphate with a state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, some of them tried to replace the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic empire with a Turkish commonwealth, the advocates of this idea were influenced by the nationalism of the Young Turks. Leaders like Mustafa Kemal Atatürk acknowledged that such a goal was impossible, replacing pan-Turkic idealism with a form of nationalism which aimed to preserve the existence of an Anatolian nucleus.

The &quot;Türk Yurdu Dergisi&quot; (&quot;Journal of the Turkish Homeland&quot;) was founded in 1911 by Akçura. This was the most important Turkist publication of the time, &quot;in which, along with other Turkic exiles from Russia, [Akçura] attempted to instill a consciousness about the cultural unity of all Turkic peoples of the world.&quot;

In 1923, Ziya Gökalp, famous poet and theorician of Turkism ideology, wrote his book &quot;The Principles of Turkism&quot; and idealized the unity of Turkic peoples by calling Turan as a goal of Turkism.

A significant early exponent of pan-Turkism was Enver Pasha (1881–1922), the Ottoman Minister of War and acting commander-in-chief during World War I. He later became a leader of the Basmachi movement (1916–1934) against Russian and Soviet rule in Central Asia. During World War II, the Nazis founded a Turkestan Legion which was primarily composed of soldiers who hoped to establish an independent Central Asian state after the war. The German intrigue bore no fruit.

When the Turkish Republic was established under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923, interest in Pan-Turkism declined, because Atatürk promoted Turkish nationalism within Turkey. The Pan-Turkist movements gained some momentum in the 1940s, due to the support which it received from Nazi Germany, which sought to use Pan-Turkism as leverage in order to undermine Russian influence in an effort to acquire the resources of Central Asia during the course of World War II. The development of pan-Turkist and anti-Soviet ideology, in some circles, was influenced by Nazi propaganda during this period. Some sources claim that Nihal Atsız advocated Nazi doctrines and adopted a Hitler-style haircut. Alparslan Türkeş, a leading pan-Turkist, took a pro-Hitler position during the war and developed close connections with Nazi leaders in Germany. Several pan-Turkic groups in Europe apparently had ties to Nazi Germany (or its supporters) at the start of the war, if not earlier. The Turco-Tatars in Romania cooperated with the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist organisation. Although the Turkish government&#x27;s archives which date back to the World War II years have not been declassified, the level of contact can be ascertained from German archives. A ten-year Turco-German treaty of friendship was signed in Ankara on 18 January 1941. Official and semi-official meetings between German ambassador Franz von Papen and other German officials and Turkish officials, including General H. E. Erkilet (of Tatar origin and a frequent contributor to pan-Turkic journals) took place in the second half of 1941 and the early months of 1942. The Turkish officials included General Ali Fuad Erdem and Nuri Pasha (Killigil), brother of Enver Pasha.

Pan-Turkists were not supported by the Turkish government during this time and on 19 May 1944, İsmet İnönü made a speech in which he condemned Pan-Turkism as &quot;a dangerous and sick demonstration of the latest times&quot; going on to say that the Turkish Republic was &quot;facing efforts hostile to the existence of the Republic&quot; and those who advocate these ideas &quot;will only bring trouble and disaster&quot;. Nihal Atsız and other prominent pan-Turkist leaders were tried and sentenced to imprisonment for conspiring against the government. Zeki Velidi Togan was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and four years in internal exile, Reha Oğuz Türkkan was sentenced to five years and ten months in prison and two years in exile, Nihal Atsız was sentenced to six years, six months and 15 days in prison and 3 years in exile. Others were sentenced to prison terms which only ranged from a few months to four years in length. But the defendants appealed the convictions and in October 1945, the sentences of all the convicted were abolished by the Military Court of Cassation.

While Erkilet discussed military contingencies, Nuri Pasha told the Germans about his plan to establish independent states which would be allies (not satellites) of Turkey. These states would be formed by the Turkic-speaking populations which lived in Crimea, Azerbaijan, Central Asia, northwestern Iran, and northern Iraq. Nuri Pasha offered to assist Nazi Germany&#x27;s propaganda efforts on behalf of this cause. However, Turkey&#x27;s government also feared for the survival of the Turkic minorities in the USSR and it told von Papen that it could not join Germany until the USSR was crushed. The Turkish government may have been apprehensive about Soviet might, which kept the country out of the war. On a less-official level, Turkic emigrants from the Soviet Union played a crucial role in negotiations and contacts between Turkey and Germany; among them were prominent pan-Turkic activists like Zeki Velidi Togan, Mammed Amin Rasulzade, Mirza Bala, Ahmet Caferoĝlu, Sayid Shamil and Ayaz İshaki. Several Tatar military units which consisted of Turkic speakers from the Turco-Tatar and Caucasian regions of the USSR who had previously been prisoners of war of the Germans joined them and fought against the Soviets, the members of these Tatar military units generally fought as guerrillas in the hope that they would be able to secure the independence of their homelands and establish a pan-Turkic union. The units, which were reinforced, numbered several hundred thousand. Turkey took a cautious approach at the government level, but pan-Turkists were angered by the Turkish government&#x27;s inaction because they believed that it was wasting a golden opportunity to achieve the goals of pan-Turkism.

==Criticism==
Pan-Turkism is often perceived as being a new form of Turkish imperial ambition. Some view the young Turk leaders who believed that they could reclaim the prestige of the Ottoman Empire by espousing the pan-Turkist ideology as racist and chauvinistic.

=== Pan-Turkist views on Armenian history ===

Clive Foss, professor of ancient history at the University of Massachusetts Boston, critically notes that in &quot;1982: The Armenian File in the Light of History&quot;, Cemal Anadol writes that the Iranian Scythians and Parthians are Turks. According to Anadol, the Armenians welcomed the Turks into the region; their language is a mixture with no roots and their alphabet is mixed, with 11 characters which were borrowed from the ancient Turkic alphabet. Foss calls this view historical revisionism: &quot;Turkish writings have been tendentious: history has been viewed as performing a useful service, proving or supporting a point of view, and so it is treated as something flexible which can be manipulated at will&quot;. He concludes, &quot;The notion, which seems well established in Turkey, that the Armenians were a wandering tribe without a home, who never had a state of their own, is of course entirely without any foundation in fact. The logical consequence of the commonly expressed view of the Armenians is that they have no place in Turkey, and they never did. The result would be the same if the viewpoint were expressed first, and the history were written to order. In a sense, something like this seems to have happened, for most Turks who grew up under the Republic were educated to believe in the ultimate priority of Turks in all parts of history, and ignore the Armenians all together; they had been clearly consigned to oblivion.&quot;

===Pan-Turkist views in Azerbaijan===
Kâzım Karabekir said 

Western Azerbaijan is a term used in the Republic of Azerbaijan to refer to Armenia. According to the Whole Azerbaijan theory, modern Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh were once inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. Its claims are based on the belief that current Armenia was ruled by Turkic tribes and states from the Late Middle Ages to the Treaty of Turkmenchay which was signed after the 1826–1828 Russo-Persian War. The concept has been sanctioned by the government of Azerbaijan and its current president, Ilham Aliyev, who has said that Armenia is part of ancient Turkic, Azerbaijani land. Turkish and Azerbaijani historians have said that Armenians are alien, not indigenous, in the Caucasus and Anatolia.

During the existence of the Azerbaijan SSR of the Soviet Union, pan-Turkist political elites of Baku who were loyal to the Communist cause invented a national history based on the existence of an Azeri nation-state that dominated the areas to the north and south of the Aras river, which was supposedly torn apart by an Iranian-Russian conspiracy in the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828. This &quot;imagined community&quot; was cherished, promoted and institutionalized in formal history books of the educational system of the Azerbaijan SSR and the post-Soviet Azerbaijan Republic. As the Soviet Union was a closed society, and its people were unaware of the actual realities regarding Iran and its Azeri citizens, the elites in Soviet Azerbaijan kept cherishing and promoting the idea of a &quot;united Azerbaijan&quot; in their activities. This romantic thought led to the founding of nostalgic literary works, known as the &quot;literature of longing&quot;; examples amongst this genre are, for instance, &quot;Foggy Tabriz&quot; by Mammed Said Ordubadi, and &quot;The Coming Day&quot; by Mirza Ibrahimov. As a rule, works belonging to the &quot;literature of longing&quot; genre were characterized by depicting the life of Iranian Azeris as a misery due to suppression by the &quot;Fars&quot; (Persians), and by narrating fictional stories about Iranian Azeris waiting for the day when their &quot;brothers&quot; from the &quot;north&quot; would come and liberate them. Works that belonged to this genre, as the historian and political scientist Zaur Gasimov explains, &quot;were examples of blatant Azerbaijani nationalism stigmatizing the “division” of the nation along the river Araxes, as well as denunciations of economic and cultural exploitation of Iranian Azerbaijanis, etc.&quot; Gasimov adds: &quot;an important by-product of this literary genre was strongly articulated anti-Iranian rhetoric. Tolerance and even support of this anti-Iranian rhetoric by the communist authorities were obvious.&quot;

Nationalist political elites in post-Soviet Azerbaijan, being the inheritors of this mentality created during the Soviet rule, forwarded this &quot;mission&quot; for achieving a &quot;united Azerbaijan&quot; as a political goal of utmost importance. Azerbaijani president Abulfaz Elchibey (1992–93) devoted his life to carrying out this mission, and he, in tandem with other pan-Turkist elites, went on a campaign for the ethnic awakening of Iranian Azeris. It may be due to these ideas that Elchibey was elected president in the new country&#x27;s first presidential election in 1992. He and his government has been widely described as pursuing Pan-Turkic and anti-Iranian policies. Other than the pan-Turkist leadership, nationalist intellectuals and Azerbaijani media also stipulated the question of &quot;Southern Azerbaijan&quot; in their main political agenda&#x27;s. In 1995-1996, according to one survey of the Azerbaijani press, the question of Iranian Azeris was covered more than any other topic by state-controlled and independent outlets in the young republic of Azerbaijan. Since 1918, political elites with Pan-Turkist-oriented sentiments in the area that comprises the present-day Azerbaijan Republic have depended on the concept of ethnic nationalism in order to create an anti-Iranian sense of ethnicity amongst Iranian Azeris. Iranian Azerbaijani intellectuals who have promoted Iranian cultural and national identity and put forth a reaction to early pan-Turkist claims over Iran&#x27;s Azerbaijan region have been dubbed traitors to the &quot;Azerbaijani nation&quot; within the pan-Turkist media of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Ahmad Kazemi, the author of the book &quot;Security in South Caucasus&quot;, told Iran&#x27;s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations in a 2021 interview that &quot;Azerbaijan is seeking to establish the so-called pan-Turkish illusionary Zangezur corridor in south of Armenia under the pretext of creating connectivity in the region&quot;, arguing that &quot;this corridor is not compatible with any of the present geopolitical and historical realities of the region&quot;.

===Russian views on pan-Turkism===
In Tsarist Russian circles, pan-Turkism was considered a political, irredentist and aggressive idea. Turkic peoples in Russia were threatened by Turkish expansion, and I. Gasprinsky and his followers were accused of being Turkish spies. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks’ attitude to Turkism differed significantly from the Russian Empire’s. At the 10th Congress of Bolshevik Communist Party in 1921, the party &quot;condemned pan-Turkism as a slope to bourgeois-democratic nationalism&quot;, however unofficially pan-Turkism was supported and promoted. The emergence of a pan-Turkism scare in Soviet propaganda made it one of the “most frightening” political labels in the USSR. The most widespread accusation used in the repression of educated Tatars and other Turkic peoples during the 1930s was that of pan-Turkism.

===In the United States and the rest of the New World===
Pan-Turkists like Reha Oğuz Türkkan have openly claimed that pre-Columbian civilizations were Turkic civilizations and they have also claimed that modern-day Native Americans are Turkic peoples, and activities which Turkish lobbying groups have conducted in order to draw Native Americans into the service of the wider Turkic world agenda have drawn criticism and triggered accusations that the Turkish government is falsifying the history of Native Americans in the service of Turkish imperialist ambitions. According to an article by Polat Kaya which was published by the Turkish Cultural Foundation, the exact origins of Native Americans remain unclear and while they are widely believed to have migrated from Asia, the exact connection between Native Americans and other Turkic peoples remains disputed.

The idea has also been discussed in the francophone world, noting that as victors in the First World War, England and France &quot;dismembered the Arab portion&quot; of the Ottoman Empire and shared it amongst themselves, further alienating Turkey. The loss of the Arabian oil fields limited Turkey becoming a petroleum power on the world stage; called &quot;le panturquisme&quot; in French, authors argue that it arose as a way of reclaiming some of the lost glory after the Ottoman defeat in the war and the loss of prestige in the region.

==Pseudoscientific theories==
Pan-Turkism has been characterized by pseudoscientific theories known as Pseudo-Turkology. Though dismissed in serious scholarship, scholars promoting such theories, often known as Pseudo-Turkologists, have in recent times emerged among every Turkic nationality. A leading light among them is Murad Adzhi, who insists that two hundred thousand years ago, &quot;an advanced people of Turkic blood&quot; were living in the Altai Mountains. These tall and blond Turks are supposed to have founded the world&#x27;s first state, Idel-Ural, 35,000 years ago, and to have migrated as far as the Americas. According to theories like the Turkish History Thesis, promoted by pseudo-scholars, the Turkic peoples are supposed to have migrated from Central Asia to the Middle East in the Neolithic. The Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, and ancient Egyptians are here classified as being of Turkic origin. The Kurgan cultures of the early Bronze Age up to more recent times are also typically ascribed to Turkic peoples by pan-Turkic pseudoscholars, such as Ismail Miziev. Non-Turkic peoples typically classified as Turkic, Turkish, Proto-Turkish or Turanian include Huns, Scythians, Sakas, Cimmerians, Medes, Parthians, Pannonian Avars, Caucasian Albanians, and various ethnic minorities in Turkic countries, such as Kurds. Adzhi also considers Alans, Goths, Burgundians, Saxons, Alemanni, Angles, Lombards, and many Russians as Turks. Only a few prominent peoples in history, such as Jews, Chinese people, Armenians, Greeks, Persians, and Scandinavians are considered non-Turkic by Adzhi. Philologist Mirfatyh Zakiev, former chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Tatar ASSR, has published hundreds of &quot;scientific&quot; works on the subject, suggesting Turkic origins of the Sumerian, Greek, Icelandic, Etruscan and Minoan languages. Zakiev contends that &quot;proto-Turkish is the starting point of the Indo-European languages&quot;. Not only peoples and cultures, but also prominent individuals, such as Saint George, Peter the Great, Mikhail Kutuzov and Fyodor Dostoevsky, are proclaimed to have been &quot;of Turkic origin&quot;. As such the Turkic peoples are supposed to have once been the &quot;benevolent conquerors&quot; of the peoples of most of Eurasia, who thus owe them &quot;a huge cultural debt&quot;. The pseudoscientific Sun Language Theory states that all human languages are descendants of a proto-Turkic language and was developed by the Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk during the 1930s. Kairat Zakiryanov considers the Japanese and Kazakh gene pools to be identical. Several Turkish academics (Şevket Koçsoy, Özkan İzgi, Emel Esin) claim that Zhou dynasty were of Turkic origins.

Philip L. Kohl notes that the above-mentioned theories are nothing more than &quot;incredible myths&quot;. Nevertheless, the promotion of these theories have &quot;taken on large-scale proportions&quot; in countries such as Turkey and Azerbaijan. Often associated with Greek, Assyrian and Armenian genocide denial, pan-Turkic pseudoscience has received extensive state and state-backed non-governmental support, and is taught all the way from elementary school to the highest level of universities in such countries. Turkish and Azerbaijani students are imbued with textbooks which make &quot;absurdly inflated&quot; claims which state that all Eurasian nomads, including the Scythians, and all civilizations on the territory of the Ottoman Empire, such as Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and the Byzantine Empire, were of Turkic origin. Konstantin Sheiko and Stephen Brown explain the reemergence of such pseudo-history as a form of national therapy, helping its proponents cope with the failures of the past.

<text>James George Snyder Sr. (born Dimetrios Georgios Synodinos, September 9, 1918 – April 21, 1996), better known as Jimmy the Greek, was an American sports commentator and Las Vegas bookmaker. A regular contributor to the CBS program &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, Snyder predicted the scores of NFL games, which sports bettors used to determine the point spread. In January 1988, Snyder was fired by CBS after he made comments suggesting that breeding practices during slavery had led blacks to become superior athletes.

==Early life and career==
Snyder was born in Steubenville, Ohio. According to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of April 22, 1996, Snyder&#x27;s family roots were in the village of Tholopotami (Θολoποτάμι), on the island of Chios in the Aegean Sea. As a teenager in Ohio, he became acquainted with bookmakers. When he was ten years old, he lost his mother when his uncle, driven mad by the loss of his wife, shot and killed Snyder&#x27;s mother and aunt, who were walking home, before killing himself. Snyder told his mother that he wanted to stay at the grocery store that his father was running and play rather than walk home with his mother, which he cited as likely saving his life but also as a reason he became a gambler.

According to his autobiography &quot;Jimmy the Greek&quot;, Snyder bet $10,000 on the 1948 election between Thomas Dewey and Harry S. Truman, getting 17–1 odds for Truman to win. In a later interview he indicated that he knew Truman was going to win because Dewey had a mustache and &quot;American women didn&#x27;t trust men with a mustache&quot;.

He invested money in oil drilling and coal mining, but those ventures failed. He lived in Las Vegas after moving there in the 1950s. He worked as an oddsmaker and gambler, at places such as the Vegas Turf and Sportsroom. In 1962, he was convicted of interstate transportation of bets and wagering information alongside conspiracy and violating the Federal Communications Act (having been caught giving a betting tip over the telephone). He was fined $50,000 and labeled a convicted felon. He worked in public relations for a time, including a couple of years working for Howard Hughes. In the mid-1960s, he began a news column involving a sports betting line for the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, which eventually received widespread publication.

In 1974, he received a presidential pardon from Gerald Ford.

The sports line eventually led to a 12-year stint on the CBS Sunday morning show, &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, a pregame show for National Football League (NFL) games, starting in 1976. Known simply as &quot;Jimmy the Greek,&quot; he would appear in segments with sportscaster Brent Musburger and predict the results of that week&#x27;s NFL games. While already famous in gambling circles, his rough charm made him into a minor celebrity. He would have conflicts with both Musburger and Phyllis George, with a 1980 fight happening between Musberger and Snyder while George was brought to tears by a comment made by Snyder over her husband, then-Kentucky Governor John Brown. While Musberger would make light of the fight (covered by the press), George would request to have Snyder tape his segment with Musberger in advance so that Snyder and George were not on the set at the same time.

As sports betting was illegal in most of the United States, and was at the time a general social taboo, his segment would not overtly mention betting or gambling. Instead, Snyder would predict the score of each game; for example, he would say the Los Angeles Raiders would beat the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 31–21 (ten points). This allowed bettors who knew the line of the game to be able to deduce his selection when betting the point spread: If the spread in the example game was the Raiders by five, bettors would know Snyder was picking the Raiders to beat it. The NFL was adamant about avoiding any official connections between gambling and the league, but NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle was an acquaintance of Snyder and made it clear that his work on CBS was acceptable.

===Racial comments and dismissal ===
On January 16, 1988, Snyder was fired by the CBS network (where he had been a regular on &quot;NFL Today&quot; since 1976) after making several questionable comments about African Americans during a lunchtime interview on January 15, 1988, with Ed Hotaling, a producer-reporter for NBC-owned WRC-TV, at Duke Zeibert&#x27;s Washington, D.C., restaurant. Hotaling said that he had been doing interviews with various people in the restaurant for a program celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. and what they thought the next step in civil rights progress for African Americans should be. He put the question to Snyder. &quot;It was all on the occasion of Martin Luther King&#x27;s birthday,&quot; Hotaling said. &quot;So I thought it was an appropriate, forward-looking question, and got a backward-looking answer.&quot; Hotaling did not approve of the firing in an interview, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s outrageous he [Snyder] should be fired for exercising his First Amendment rights. Rather than silence him, they should keep him on and cover the issue of civil rights in sports.&quot;

One of Snyder&#x27;s more controversial responses to the question was that African Americans were naturally superior athletes at least in part because they had been bred to produce stronger offspring during slavery:


According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, Snyder expressed regret for his comments: &quot;What a foolish thing to say.&quot; His CBS coworkers publicly stated that they did not agree with Snyder&#x27;s theories and that they did not oppose CBS&#x27;s decision to fire him. Black former NFL player Irv Cross said in the &quot;30 for 30&quot; documentary about Snyder that he had worked alongside Snyder for a long time and did not consider him to be a racist at all. In the same documentary, Frank Deford sympathetically noted that Jimmy often tried to sound more educated than he actually was and that his comments were basically him trying to make a point about a subject on which he knew nothing.

In the same WRC-TV interview, Snyder, whose remarks were termed &quot;reprehensible&quot; by CBS, also commented that the only sports realm in which white people then dominated was coaching and that if Black people were to &quot;take coaching, as I think everyone wants them to, there is not going to be anything left for the white people.&quot; Snyder, during his remarks, emphasized he was not meaning to be &quot;derogatory&quot; but said the only thing then that &quot;whites control are the coaching jobs — the Black talent is beautiful, it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s out there. The only thing left for the whites is a couple of coaching jobs.&quot;

In 1991, Snyder sued the CBS network for age discrimination, defamation, and breach of contract. Snyder maintained that his firing aggravated his personal health problems, according to court papers. Snyder&#x27;s attorney, Jeffery L. Liddle, stated that by &quot;firing and repudiating Mr. Snyder, CBS quashed his dream, his dignity, and his spirit.&quot; Snyder lost the case.

==In popular culture==

Snyder appeared in a cameo in the 1981 comedy film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; as a bookie. In the movie, he offered 50–1 odds against Formula One driver Jamie Blake (played by Dean Martin) and gambler Morris Fenderbaum (played by Sammy Davis Jr.) winning the Cannonball coast-to-coast endurance race. Snyder and Dean Martin were childhood acquaintances in Steubenville, Ohio.

On November 10, 2009, ESPN aired a show in their &quot;30 for 30&quot; series titled &quot;The Legend of Jimmy the Greek,&quot; which was produced by Fritz Mitchell. Commentary was provided by, among others, Brent Musburger, Irv Cross and Phyllis George from &quot;The NFL Today&quot;, plus Anthony Snyder (Jimmy&#x27;s son), as well as his brother Johnny and sister Angie. The show also acknowledges his role in the first sportscasts of poker tournaments.

Although Snyder was largely unknown outside of the United States, in 1974, his name achieved international renown. After beating George Foreman to regain the world heavyweight championship, Muhammad Ali, in the midst of an interview with David Frost, looked into the camera and addressed his doubters. &quot;All of you bow&quot; he said. &quot;All of my critics crawl... All of you suckers bow... If you wanna know any damn thing about boxing, don&#x27;t go to no boxing experts in Las Vegas, don&#x27;t go to no Jimmy the Greek. Come to Muhammad Ali.&quot;

He was parodied in sketches on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Second City Television&quot;, portrayed on the respective programs by Phil Hartman and John Candy. His comments about black athletes also inspired an appearance by Hans and Franz.

Snyder is also parodied in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Lisa the Greek&quot;, which was named after him. A character modeled after him named &quot;Smooth&quot; Jimmy Apollo (played by Phil Hartman) is featured in the episode giving dubious predictions about football games.

Snyder was referenced in an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; titled &quot;And Ma Makes Three.&quot; Rose asks Dorothy if she is really going to dump her mother in order to spend alone time with her boyfriend, Dorothy responds with &quot;Faster than CBS dumped Jimmy the Greek.&quot;

Snyder was again referenced in an episode of &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot; where Norm Macdonald quipped to guest star Kevin Nealon, &quot;They fired Jimmy the Greek for being a racist. Meanwhile they call him &#x27;the Greek.&#x27;&quot;

==Personal life==
Snyder and his wife Joan lost three of their five children to cystic fibrosis.

Snyder suffered from diabetes in his later years and died of a heart attack on April 21, 1996, in Las Vegas, Nevada at the age of 77. He was buried at Union Cemetery in his native Steubenville.

<text>John Michael Brearley (born 28 April 1942) is a retired English first-class cricketer who captained Cambridge University, Middlesex, and England. He was the captain of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.

Brearley captained the international side in 31 of his 39 Test matches, winning 18 and losing only 4. He was the President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2007–08. Since his retirement from professional cricket he has pursued a career as a psychoanalyst, psychotherapist (registered with the BPC), motivational speaker, and writer, serving as President of the British Psychoanalytical Society 2008–10. In 2015, an article in the Bleacher Report ranked Brearley as England&#x27;s greatest-ever cricket captain.

==Early life==
Brearley was born in Harrow, Middlesex, England, and was educated at the City of London School (where his father Horace, himself a first-class cricketer, was a master). While at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Brearley excelled at cricket (he was then a wicketkeeper/batsman). After making 76 on his first-class debut as a wicketkeeper, he played for Cambridge University between 1961 and 1968 (captaining the side in 1964), first as an undergraduate in the Classical and Moral Sciences tripos, and then as a postgraduate.

While still at Cambridge, he was chosen for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to South Africa in 1964–65, and to captain the MCC Under-25 side in Pakistan in 1966–67, where he scored 312 not out against North Zone (his highest first-class score) and 223 against the Pakistan Under-25 side. He ended the tour with 793 runs from six matches at an average of 132.

==County cricket==
From 1961 onwards, he played for Middlesex County Cricket Club, often opening the innings with Michael Smith. As captain between 1971 and 1982, he led Middlesex to County Championships in 1976, 1977 (jointly with Kent), 1980 and 1982; and he appeared in Free Foresters&#x27; very last first-class fixture, in 1968, keeping wicket and scoring 91.

==International cricket==

In part because of his pursuit of an academic career as a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, which limited his cricketing activity in 1969 and 1970, Brearley was not selected for England until the age of 34 in 1976. His record in Test cricket as a batsman was modest (he averaged 22.88 in 66 Test innings, without a century), but he was an outstanding captain. He made his highest test score of 91 on tour against India in February 1977. Having previously kept wicket, he was also a fine slip catcher, usually at first slip. He took over as captain of England later in 1977.

His management skills (he was once described by Rodney Hogg as having &quot;a degree in people&quot;) drew the best from the players in his team, although he was fortunate to be able to call on the services of Bob Willis, David Gower and Ian Botham at their peak. Brearley was captain during the infamous aluminium bat incident in 1979, when he objected to Dennis Lillee&#x27;s use of a metal bat instead of one made of willow. On the same tour, he caused controversy at the end of an international one-day match against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground when he ordered all his fielders, including the wicketkeeper, to the boundary with three runs required off the last ball (this was legal under the rules of the time).

In all, Botham and Willis took 262 wickets during the 31 test matches that Brearley captained. The importance of Willis in particular to England led Brearley into further controversies regarding the bowling of short-pitched deliveries at recognised tailend batsmen, during Pakistan&#x27;s tour of England in 1978, and more briefly, during England&#x27;s 1978–9 tour of Australia. Brearley himself had been an innovator regarding cricket equipment himself, wearing a &#x27;skull cap&#x27; under his England cap in 1977 (in the days before players wore helmets). It consisted of a plastic protector with two side pieces protecting his temples. It was later popularised by the Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar.

Brearley captained England to the final of the 1979 Cricket World Cup, scoring 53 in the semi-final against New Zealand and 64 in the final against the West Indies. However, his opening partnership of 129 with Geoff Boycott in the final used up 38 of 60 allotted overs; although it was recognised that a potent pace attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft and Joel Garner needed to be countered, the speed of the partnership greatly added to the pressure on the rest of the order. Garner bowled a spell of 5 wickets for 4 runs to induce a drastic collapse and hand the West Indies the match and the World Cup by 92 runs.

Having passed the England captaincy to Ian Botham in 1980 (losing his Test place in the process), Brearley returned as captain following Botham&#x27;s resignation for the third Test against Australia at Headingley in 1981, going on to win the match and two of the remaining three matches of the series to win the Ashes 3–1.

His leadership benefited from Botham&#x27;s recovered form following his winless captaincy record and his nosedive in form (he had made a pair in the second Test at Lord&#x27;s) to take a first-innings 6 for 95 and score 50 and 149 not out in the third Test at Headingley, bowl a spell of 5 wickets for 1 run in the fourth Test at Edgbaston, score 118 from 102 balls in the fifth Test at Old Trafford, and take a 10-wicket match haul (6 for 125 and 4 for 128) in the sixth Test at the Oval. In spite of his limited reputation as an international batsman, Brearley also made an important if less high-profile contribution to the fourth test, scoring more runs than any other batsman (61) in a match which England won by 29 runs.

==Post-cricket career==
Brearley opposed sporting links with apartheid South Africa, seconding a motion to the MCC in 1968 calling for the cessation of tours until there was progress towards non-racial cricket. He seconded the motion from David Sheppard to the MCC, calling for the England tour to South Africa to be cancelled, and was a supporter of John Arlott who campaigned in &quot;The Guardian&quot; for the same objective.

He is now a psychoanalyst, psychotherapist (registered with the BPC), motivational speaker, and part-time cricket journalist for &quot;The Times&quot;. He was appointed an OBE in 1978, and published &quot;The Art of Captaincy&quot; in 1985. He published another book, &quot;On Form&quot;, in 2017. In 1998, he became an Honorary Fellow of his Cambridge college, St. John&#x27;s and in 2006 was awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford Brookes University.

Brearley succeeded Doug Insole as President of MCC on 1 October 2007, and chose Derek Underwood to succeed him at the end of his term. He was president of the British Psychoanalytical Society, 2008–10.

In June 2024 Brearley was quoted in The Cricket Paper &quot;&quot;Both the ICC&#x27;s deal with Aramco and the MCC&#x27;s with JP Morgan are disturbing. There is currently so much &#x27;rowing back&#x27; from recognising the huge dangers of climate change and the need for us to be proactive on the edge of this abyss. We all have to make some sacrifices in order to do this...The CEO of Aramco recently said &#x27;we should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas&#x27; I find this remark chilling. We in cricket should not align ourselves with such views&quot;.&quot;

==Personal life==
Brearley has been married twice. He is married to Mana Sarabhai, who is from Ahmedabad, India and whose father was a psychoanalyst. They have two children together.

Brearley lives in London.

<doc id="860974" wikidata="Q1168760" url="?curid=860974" title="Upstairs, Downstairs (1971 TV series)">
<text>Upstairs, Downstairs is a British drama television series produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) for ITV. It ran for 68 episodes divided into five series on ITV from 1971 to 1975.

Set in a large townhouse at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia in central London, the series depicts the servants—&quot;downstairs&quot;—and their masters, the family—&quot;upstairs&quot;—between the years 1903 and 1930, and shows the slow decline of the British aristocracy. Great events feature prominently in each episode but minor or gradual changes are also noted. The show may be regarded as a documentary of the social and technological changes that occurred during those 27 years, including the Edwardian period, women&#x27;s suffrage, the First World War, the Roaring Twenties, and the Wall Street crash. It was a ratings success for ITV and received outstanding acclaim worldwide, winning multiple awards.

The BBC Wales and &quot;Masterpiece&quot;-produced continuation &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; was broadcast by BBC One in 2010.

==Background==
&quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was originally an idea by two actress friends, Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, for a comedy titled &quot;Behind the Green Baize Door&quot;. It focused on two housemaids, played by Marsh and Atkins, in a large English country house in the Victorian era. They soon added a family upstairs, as Marsh recognised &quot;Servants have to serve somebody&quot;. In summer 1969, they took this idea to Sagitta Productions, which was run by John Hawkesworth and John Whitney. They soon removed the comedy element, changed the setting to a large townhouse in Edwardian London and the title became &quot;Below Stairs&quot;. It was first offered to Granada Television in Manchester, but it declined as it already had a period drama, titled &quot;A Family at War&quot;, about to start. However, Stella Richman, the controller of Programmes at London Weekend Television, saw potential, and in April 1970, the first series was commissioned.

Characters were then developed, but when Alfred Shaughnessy, an old friend of John Hawkesworth, was called in as script editor, he changed much of the detail to make the characters more realistic. Honor Blackman was short-listed for the role of Lady Marjorie and George Cole for that of the butler, Hudson. Jean Marsh was already slated to take the part of Rose Buck, the head house parlourmaid. Eileen Atkins was scheduled to play the other maid, Sarah Moffat, opposite Jean Marsh&#x27;s Rose, but was playing Queen Victoria in a stage show at the time, so Pauline Collins took the role. Gordon Jackson was offered the role of Hudson after it was decided that Londoner George Cole was not suitable to play a Scotsman. The programme took many names, including &quot;Two Little Maids in Town&quot;, &quot;The Servants&#x27; Hall&quot; and &quot;That House in Eaton Square&quot;. It was titled &quot;165 Eaton Place&quot; until just before the production of the first episode when it was changed to &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs,&quot; following a suggestion from John Hawkesworth.

Despite having a champion in Stella Richman, the show suffered from internal politics at the station, most notably from the sales department who could not see the attraction of a period drama, and the programme&#x27;s videotapes spent nearly a year in storage awaiting a transmission date. Eventually the network had a space in its schedule at the unfashionable time of Sunday nights at 10:15 and called upon LWT to fill it. It chose &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs,&quot; and with no promotion of the show, there was little expectation of success. However, audiences steadily grew, and the series became a hit. In the United States, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was aired as part of PBS&#x27; &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;.

== Cast and characters ==
== Plot ==

The stories depict the lives of the wealthy Bellamy family (&quot;upstairs&quot;), who reside at 165 Eaton Place in London&#x27;s fashionable Belgravia, and their servants (&quot;downstairs&quot;).

The household is led by Lady Marjorie Bellamy (née Talbot-Carey), daughter of the Earl and Countess of Southwold, and her husband Richard Bellamy MP, the son of a country parson. They married despite the objections of her parents and set up house at 165 Eaton Place, one of several London properties owned by Lord Southwold. Richard is a politician, and several plots revolve around his political ambitions and conflicts arising from his desire to follow both his conscience and his allegiance to his father-in-law&#x27;s politically conservative Tory party.

Richard and Lady Marjorie Bellamy have two children, James and Elizabeth, who are, respectively, in their early 20s and late teens when the series starts in 1903. In 1912, James&#x27;s wife Hazel becomes the mistress of the house following Lady Marjorie&#x27;s death, and the following year, Richard&#x27;s ward, Georgina, comes to live at 165 Eaton Place.

The original servants were the authoritarian butler Mr Angus Hudson, cook Mrs Kate Bridges, pragmatic head house parlourmaid Rose Buck, sweet Irish kitchen maid Emily, eccentric footman Alfred, mischievous under-house parlourmaid Sarah, coachman Pearce, and Lady Marjorie&#x27;s lady&#x27;s maid Maude Roberts. Over the years they are joined by Edward, a cheeky footman who later becomes a chauffeur; Daisy, the parlourmaid who eventually marries Edward; Thomas Watkins, the devious chauffeur who dallies with Sarah&#x27;s affections; and Ruby, the slow-witted kitchen maid.

In the episode &quot;Another Year&quot; from series 4, Hazel Bellamy notes that there are two families living in the house, one upstairs and the other downstairs, which she likens to a related family: Mr Hudson and Mrs Bridges are the father and mother; Rose, the eldest daughter who lost her man at the front; their son Edward and his wife, their daughter-in-law Daisy; and Ruby, the youngest child.

=== Series One (set 1903–1908) ===
The first and second series span the period 1903 to 1910, during the reign of Edward VII. In 1903, Sarah Moffat applies to be under-house-parlour maid for the Bellamy family, pretending to be of French parentage but soon revealed to be illiterate, English, and with no work history. Later in the year, Lady Marjorie poses for bohemian artist Mr Scone (which he pronounces &quot;skoon&quot;), who over the same period paints an intimate portrait of Sarah and (an imagined) Rose, the Bellamy&#x27;s head house maid; he exhibits both paintings juxtaposed at the Royal Academy. Fearing a scandal, Bellamy threatens to sack the two maids but is dissuaded by Scone. Later, the Bellamys holiday in Scotland. With Mr Hudson gone from London, the servants carouse drunkenly through the house only to be caught by the Bellamy son James, who promises not to disclose their misbehaviour. James and Sarah later have an affair that results in Sarah&#x27;s pregnancy. James is banished to India, while Sarah is sent to the Southwold estate for the duration of her pregnancy.

Around 1905, daughter Elizabeth returns from Germany to be prepared to be presented to the King and the Queen Consort at a social event. Her rebellious, headstrong nature causes her to flee the event. She later talks with servant Rose, who lectures her about the importance of duty and how it applies to the entire household.

Elizabeth soon falls in love with German Baron Klaus von Rimmer, unaware that he is gay and that he is using her in a scheme to obtain naval secrets from her father. Rose catches him having sex with Alfred, the footman, and he flees Eaton Place before the police arrive and arrest them. To spare Elizabeth the real reason for his departure, she is told that he is a spy. Alfred is replaced by Edward Barnes, a young and naive footman whose fun-loving and immature nature initially annoys Mr Hudson.

In the summer of 1906, Lady Marjorie is enamoured with her son James&#x27;s friend, Captain Charles Hammond. She has an affair with him, but guilt compels her to break it off. While Lady Bellamy and Rose are away in the country, a new under-house-parlour maid, Mary Stokes, arrives. She is pregnant, having been raped by Myles Radford, the son of a powerful politician and a Bellamy family friend. Richard Bellamy attempts to help Mary, but the Radfords refuse to take responsibility and the legal system proves ineffective. Mary quits, but departs with a small gift of money from some of the servants.

The following year, 1907, Mrs Van Groeben arrives from South Africa. Housemaid Emily falls passionately in love with Mrs Van Groeben&#x27;s footman, William. Mrs Van Groeben learns of the affair, and, considering Emily to be beneath William, forbids him to see her. William drops Emily when he learns of his mistress&#x27;s disapproval, suggesting he never really cared about her. Emily takes her own life. Mrs Bridges, distraught with remorse over Emily&#x27;s death, steals a baby from its pram outside a shop and hides it in her room. The baby is returned to its parents by Richard and Lady Marjorie, and Mrs Bridges only escapes a jail sentence after Hudson agrees to marry her once they are no longer in service. The scullery maid position is first replaced by Doris, then by Nellie, and finally by Ruby, who is rather slow and is frequently scolded by Mrs Bridges.

In 1908, daughter Elizabeth Bellamy marries Lawrence Kirbridge, a young poet.

=== Series Two (set 1908–1910) ===
Somewhat indifferent to his new responsibilities as a householder, Lawrence also avoids marital relations with Elizabeth, claiming he prefers her to be pure and muse-like, leaving their marriage unconsummated. Elizabeth has a brief affair with Lawrence&#x27;s publisher, which Lawrence facilitates. It results in Elizabeth becoming pregnant, giving birth to a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth. Elizabeth joins militant suffragettes who attack the home of a prominent politician, resulting in her being arrested. She is bailed out shortly thereafter by a wealthy Armenian gentleman named Julius Karekin. They become romantically involved, and he buys a hat shop for her to manage. Karekin is more interested in buying his way into British society than he is in Elizabeth&#x27;s affections. He buys the lease of 165 Eaton Place after the Bellamys are forced to sell in the aftermath of Lady Marjorie&#x27;s father&#x27;s death in 1909. He offers the lease to Elizabeth who then gives it to her parents. Richard and Lady Marjorie are now morally in Karekin&#x27;s debt.

A pregnant Sarah returns to Eaton Place the night the Bellamys host the king for dinner; Sarah goes into labour, but the baby, a son, is stillborn. James eventually returns from India just before his mother&#x27;s birthday on 6 May 1910 (which coincides with the death of King Edward VII). He brings his brash and gushing fiancée, Phyllis, the daughter of an army veterinarian. James eventually breaks off the engagement, however, realizing that Phyllis is not right for him.

Elizabeth eventually moves to America in 1910 after splitting from Karekin and divorcing Kirbridge. She is later said to have married a man named Dana. Sarah falls in love with chauffeur, Thomas Watkins, who previously worked as Lawrence Kirbridge&#x27;s valet. Sarah becomes pregnant again and will be dismissed. Thomas offers to marry her, but no one knows it is actually his child. To avoid any scandal, Lord Bellamy arranges for them to leave service and start their own business. While in the &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; episode &quot;A Family Gathering&quot; it is stated that Thomas and Sarah were married, this fact is disregarded in the spin-off series &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot;.

In episode 9 of this series, &quot;An Object of Value&quot;, veteran British actress Cathleen Nesbitt made a guest appearance as Lady Southwold, Lady Marjorie&#x27;s mother. At the end of the second season, actresses Rachel Gurney (as Lady Marjorie) and Nicola Pagett (as Elizabeth) permanently left the series, but Gurney appeared briefly in the premiere episode of the third season (&quot;Miss Forrest&quot;). Pagett&#x27;s character of Elizabeth never was seen again, but she was mentioned throughout the remainder of the series. Actresses Meg Wynn Owen as Hazel Forrest Bellamy, James&#x27;s wife; and Lesley-Anne Down as Georgina Worsley, Richard&#x27;s ward and James&#x27;s cousin became the major female upstairs characters.

=== Series Three (set 1912–1914) ===
Lady Marjorie, her brother, Hugo Talbot-Carey (the Earl of Southwold), and his new wife (widow Marion Worsley) all perish in the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. Miss Roberts, Lady Marjorie&#x27;s maid, survives and returns to Eaton Place, refusing to let anyone touch Marjorie&#x27;s jewellery box, believing she is keeping it for her. Richard&#x27;s new secretary, Hazel Forrest, gently persuades Miss Roberts to open the box, with her accepting Lady Marjorie is gone; she breaks down into sobs saying she tried to save her.

Richard had hired Hazel Forrest to type the biography of his father-in-law, the old Earl of Southwold, which he is writing. She and James fall in love and eventually marry. Hazel, from a respectable middle-class family, becomes mistress of the household. She and James are happy for a time but grow apart due to their differing backgrounds. Their estrangement is worsened by Hazel&#x27;s miscarriage in the spring of 1914.

Georgina Worsley, James&#x27;s cousin, comes to live with the Bellamys at Christmas 1913, aged 18. Georgina is the orphaned stepdaughter of Lady Marjorie&#x27;s brother Hugo. She befriends Daisy, the new parlour maid. Georgina decides she and Daisy should take food from the pantry to give to Daisy&#x27;s struggling family. She is shocked to discover that Daisy&#x27;s family live in miserable, abject poverty.

Rose, the head houseparlourmaid, is shocked when Alfred, the Bellamys&#x27; former footman, turns up at Eaton Place one night. He claims that he has been sacked by his former employer and is homeless. She agrees to hide him in one of the basement rooms, but is horrified when it later transpires Alfred is actually on the run from the police having murdered his previous employer. After taking Edward hostage in the coal cellar, Alfred is arrested and eventually hanged for murder. The following year, Rose briefly becomes engaged to an Australian sheep-farmer named Gregory Wilmot whom she meets on a tram. She agrees to move to Australia with him, but at embarkation she discovers that he has a wife in Australia and decides to remain in the life she knows at Eaton Place, a plot line that echoes the story &quot;Eveline&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Dubliners&quot;.

Richard, who has sold the house&#x27;s lease to James after Lady Marjorie&#x27;s death (all her money passed on to James and Elizabeth), makes money after a share tip-off from a member of his gentleman&#x27;s club. Richard later is accused unjustly of insider dealing. It is only Hazel&#x27;s and Hudson&#x27;s intervention that saves his career and reputation. This plot was inspired by the Marconi scandal of 1912.

During a visit to Somerby, the country house of James&#x27;s school-friend Lord &quot;Bunny&quot; Newbury in the autumn of 1913, Edward unwittingly becomes a witness in an impending divorce when he spies rising Tory MP Lord Charles Gilmour leaving the bedroom of a fellow MP&#x27;s wife. Edward is pressured to change his story, but he refuses, and the case is withdrawn due to Richard&#x27;s influence.

The servants are offered a day&#x27;s holiday in Herne Bay in Kent in August 1914. They enjoy a rare day out together. Hudson is persuaded to sing on the vaudeville stage but their enjoyment is curtailed by an announcement that Germany has invaded Belgium. Hudson instead sings &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;. Back in London, they gather to mark the hour when Britain goes to war.

In the Christmas episode, &quot;Goodwill to All Men&quot;, Cathleen Nesbitt returns for a second and final appearance as Lady Southwold.

=== Series Four (set 1914–1918) ===
James serves in World War I, is seriously injured in a trench battle and brought home, amid much difficulty, to recover. He is nursed by his step-cousin Georgina, who now volunteers as a VAD Nurse and serves in France during the war. Georgina and James develop a close understanding and affection during the war but do not go so far as to become lovers. Downstairs, Edward signs up and fights in the trenches, Hudson serves as a Special Constable, Rose works as a bus conductress, and Ruby leaves Eaton Place to work in a munitions factory in Silvertown, returning to service after the Silvertown explosion. Hazel, unknowingly echoing her late mother-in-law Lady Marjorie, has a brief affair with an RFC Lieutenant named Jack Dyson who, like herself, has risen from the ranks of the middle classes. He is killed while James is at home on leave. Rose meets up with Gregory Wilmot again. After overcoming their emotional and practical hurdles, she finally agrees to marry him on his return from the war and follow him to Australia. However, he is killed in action. Rose is heartbroken but Gregory has left her £1,275 in his will, enough to make her independent in her retirement. Edward returns, and while not physically wounded, suffers badly from shell shock and goes into hospital. He speaks to Richard, who comforts him, assuring him that mental wounds are as real as physical, and no mark on his character.

The fourth season ends in 1918 with the close of World War I. Both James and Georgina return from their wartime duties. Despite the celebration and relief that the war is over, Hazel, who is about 35 at this time, contracts influenza in the worldwide pandemic. She dies, and the Bellamy household is devastated over her loss. Grief-stricken, James lets Georgina comfort him, but she stops him from any closeness. Richard is elevated to the House of Lords as Viscount Bellamy of Haversham in the New Year Honours List of 1919.

At the end of the fourth series Meg Wynn Owen left the show, with her character Hazel dying of influenza in the Spanish flu pandemic. The character of Virginia Hamilton, played by Hannah Gordon, was introduced in the fourth series when she asked Richard for help in relation to her son.

=== Series Five (set 1919–1930) ===
According to Jean Marsh and Simon Williams, at the end of the fourth series they, along with other cast members, were eager to move on to other projects. However, with much persuasion by the producers and writers, they, along with the rest of the cast, agreed to do a fifth and final series showing the Bellamy family and staff entering the decade of the twenties and ending the series with the start of the Great Depression. During the final series, Marsh and Williams reduced their appearances on the show, both appearing in only 11 instalments out of the sixteen episodes produced. In addition, eight new cast members were added to the series, which included two servants, Frederick and Lily, played by Gareth Hunt and Karen Dotrice; Richard Bellamy&#x27;s new wife, Virginia (played by Hannah Gordon); Virginia&#x27;s two children Alice and William (Anne Yarker and Jonathan Seely); Shirley Cain as Miss Treadwell, the children&#x27;s governess; Madeleine Cannon as Lady Dorothy (Dolly) Hale, Georgina&#x27;s self-centred, catty, fair weather friend; and Anthony Andrews as Lord (Robert) Stockbridge, Georgina&#x27;s fiancé and husband.

At the start of the fifth season, James is grieving Hazel&#x27;s death. Richard marries widow Virginia Hamilton, after the events of the fourth series when she asked Richard and his solicitor Sir Geoffrey Dillon (Raymond Huntley), to defend her son, Michael, who was charged with cowardice during the war. He was acquitted but later killed. Richard and Virginia return from their honeymoon. With only himself and Georgina living at Eaton Place, James considers dismissing the servants and selling the house. He wants Richard and Virginia to move in, but Virginia wants her own home. Collaborating with Georgina, James invites Richard, Virginia, and her two children, Alice, aged 10 and William, aged 6, to tea. The house comes alive with their visit. James, Georgina, and the servants welcome them wholeheartedly and Virginia is convinced this is perfect home for her family. Alice becomes attached to Rose, whose duties keep her upstairs with the children and the new Lady Bellamy.

Downstairs, Edward and a pregnant Daisy have left Eaton Place and are replaced by Frederick (James&#x27;s batman during the war) and Lily, respectively. Edward&#x27;s job prospects are dim, and Daisy miscarries due to malnutrition; both are re-hired at Eaton Place as chauffeur and house parlourmaid, respectively. Rose tends the children and Lady Virginia&#x27;s maid.

William is sent to a boarding school while Alice resumes her schooling with Miss Treadwell. To compensate for William&#x27;s absence, Rose gives Alice a cairn terrier named Thimble. While Lord and Lady Bellamy are away, Miss Treadwell quickly assumes the role as head of the house alienating the servants and mentally and physically abuses Alice and her dog. Upon their return, Lord and Lady Bellamy dismiss Miss Treadwell. Richard and Virginia then decide that Alice should go to a day school for her studies. After that instalment, Alice, William, and the dog are never seen again, but they are frequently referred to, and Alice returns for a brief appearance in the final episode.

Downstairs, romance blooms between Hudson and Lily, but she spurns him and Lily leaves her position. Frederick leaves service at the Bellamy house when he discovers the allure of escorting young upper-class women to balls and other functions. Also during this season, the roles played by actresses Jenny Tomasin and Joan Benham were expanded to show character depth. For Tomasin, the role of the childlike, simple-minded kitchen maid Ruby Finch was showcased in two episodes – the eighth instalment &quot;Such A Lovely Man&quot; where Ruby meets a man named Herbert through magazine correspondence, but rejects him because &quot;he was no Rudolph Valentino&quot;; and the fourteenth chapter of the series, &quot;Noblesse Oblige&quot; in which Ruby, fed up and disgusted with Mrs. Bridges&#x27;s treatment of her, temporarily leaves her position at Eaton Place after they have a bitter quarrel. Benham&#x27;s character of Lady Prudence Fairfax (or Pru as she was affectionately referred to) had been featured throughout the previous four series as a long time close friend of the Bellamy family who was a delightful social butterfly always welcome at family parties and events, as well as a harmless gossipy woman. However, in the fifth series, Benham was able to show another side of Lady Prudence – as a wise, kind, loyal, loving, and devoted friend to the Bellamys in two instalments – in the fourth episode &quot;Joy Ride&quot; and the eleventh episode &quot;Alberto&quot;.

In the roaring 1920s, Georgina and her friends rebel against the depression and hard times of the post-war period, but her frivolity and merriment quickly end – first after the suicide of a friend who professed his love for her and threatened to kill himself unless she married him, and then killed himself during a Roaring 20s party at the Bellamy house. Second, Georgina accidentally kills a working-class man after taking Richard&#x27;s car without permission and driving it herself to compete in a scavenger hunt. Her friends, part of the moneyed, bored and pleasure-seeking &quot;bright young things&quot;, desert her at the inquest. Only the rich but shallow Lady Dolly Hale and also the seemingly dull Lord Robert Stockbridge, heir to a dukedom, defend her. Georgina and Robert quickly fall in love. James suffers long-term emotional stress from his war experiences and Hazel&#x27;s death. Restless, he stands for Parliament, but loses the election.

Lord Stockbridge&#x27;s parents send their son on a trip around the world to try to wean him from Georgina, under the guise of helping him discover whether his feelings are true. James returns from America in October 1929, where he has visited Elizabeth and become rich through speculation on Wall Street. Rose allows James to invest the money Gregory left her when he died in the war, but the market crashes and James loses everything. James had also &quot;borrowed a fair bit&quot; that he now is unable to repay. He has disgraced his family and taken advantage of a member of staff who trusted him. Depressed and ashamed, he goes to a hotel in Maidenhead and kills himself.
The final episode, set in 1930, finds things looking up at Eaton Place as Georgina marries Lord Stockbridge on 12 June 1930. Mr Hudson and Mrs Bridges also finally marry, and take the uneducated but surprisingly shrewd kitchen maid, Ruby Finch, to the seaside with them, to run a guest house. When asked by Rose how she feels about becoming part of the Hudsons&#x27; household, Ruby says &quot;They&#x27;ll not last long, and I&#x27;ll have guest house all to meself.&quot; Lord Bellamy has delivered his retirement speech to the House of Lords. He and Virginia retreat to a small villa in Dorset, keeping Rose Buck in their employ. Young Edward and his wife, Daisy, are elevated to the posts of butler and head house parlourmaid in the country household of the marquess and new marchioness of Stockbridge.

The last scene shows Rose taking a final walk through the now empty rooms at 165 Eaton Place, which is for sale. She &#x27;hears&#x27; in her head the voices of Lady Marjorie, Mr. Hudson, and others, as well as the many incidents she witnessed over the years. On hearing James reassuring her about Gregory&#x27;s honourable death in the war echoing in her ears, she becomes spooked and hurriedly leaves through the front door.

== Episodes ==
&quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; ran for five series from 10 December 1971 to 21 December 1975. The first four series had thirteen episodes each, while the final series had sixteen. Due to an industrial dispute over extra payments for using newly introduced colour equipment, during which broadcasting unions refused to allow their members to use colour cameras, the first six episodes of the first series were shot in black-and-white, and when colour production resumed, the first episode was remade in colour. Two endings were made, which could be shown depending on whether the black and white episodes were broadcast by the channel. The original black-and-white version of the first episode is believed to have been wiped.

The opening credits of each episode featured a cartoon from the magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, and the lettering was drawn by the graphic designer Terry Griffiths. The theme tune was composed by Alexander Faris and titled &quot;The Edwardians&quot;. It won an Ivor Novello Award. Part of this tune was made into the song &quot;What Are We Going to Do with Uncle Arthur?&quot;, sung by Sarah, with lyrics written by Alfred Shaughnessy. Pauline Collins released this as a single in 1973. The theme tune was used as the processional march for the church wedding of Elizabeth and Lawrence in series 1, episode 13: &quot;For Love of Love&quot;.

Many writers wrote episodes throughout the five series, including Alfred Shaughnessy, John Hawkesworth, Fay Weldon, Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham, John Harrison, Julian Bond, Raymond Bowers, Jeremy Paul, Rosemary Anne Sisson, Anthony Skene and Elizabeth Jane Howard.

==Production==
Each episode of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was made in a fortnightly production schedule. The book &quot;Inside Updown&quot; has a detailed production history. The first week and a half were spent rehearsing, with two days in the studio, and the latter part of the second day being used for recording. Location footage was usually shot beforehand. The exterior shots of 165 Eaton Place were filmed at 65 Eaton Place with the &quot;1&quot; painted on. &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was one of the first major colour productions to be made by LWT. Interior sequences were first recorded in LWT&#x27;s first studio facility in Wembley in London, for all of series one and the episode &quot;A Pair of Exiles&quot; in series two. For the rest of series two, and for the remaining three series, the interior sequences were recorded in LWT&#x27;s new studio complex named Kent House (later known as The London Studios) on London&#x27;s Southbank.

Herne Bay features in series three, episode thirteen &quot;The Sudden Storm&quot;, when the staff take a day out to the seaside.

The show featured the song &quot;What Are We Going to Do with Uncle Arthur?&quot;, written by Alexander Faris and Alfred Shaughnessy. Faris had also written the instrumental theme tune for the series. The song is a mildly bawdy music hall number performed by the character Sarah Moffat. Her performance of the song in the episode &quot;For Love of Love&quot; draws the interest of James Bellamy, leading to a dramatic subplot within the ongoing story of the Bellamys. A lively instrumental version of the song was played over the closing credits of each programme in the series.

==Awards==
&quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was nominated for and won many national and international awards, winning two BAFTA awards, two Royal Television Society awards, three Writers Guild Awards, eight Emmys, and a Golden Globe. It was nominated for a further seven BAFTAs, nine Emmys and four Golden Globes. It was nominated for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Drama Series in 1972, 1973, 1975, and 1976, winning in 1972 and 1974. Pauline Collins was nominated for Best Actress in 1973 for her portrayal of Sarah Moffat, and Gordon Jackson was nominated for Best Actor for playing Mr. Hudson in 1975.

In the United States, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was honoured with both the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards. In 1974, 1975, and 1977 it won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series. In 1975, Jean Marsh won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, and Bill Bain won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. The following year, it won for Outstanding Limited Series, and Gordon Jackson won for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series, and Angela Baddeley was nominated for Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In 1977, Jacqueline Tong was nominated for Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. For the Golden Globes, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; won the Golden Globe Award for Best TV Show – Drama in 1975 and was nominated again for the same award in 1978. Jean Marsh was nominated in 1975 and 1977 for Best TV Actress – Drama.

Alfred Shaughnessy, script editor and frequent writer, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award twice for the episodes &quot;Miss Forrest&quot; and &quot;Another Year&quot;. John Hawkesworth, frequent writer and producer, was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the episode &quot;The Bolter&quot;. Fay Weldon won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best British TV Series Script of 1971 for &quot;On Trial&quot;.

In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; at number 79 on its list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

== Spin-offs ==
Following the final episode of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; many ideas for spin-offs evolved. These included having the new Lord and Lady Stockbridge buying back 165 Eaton Place and an American company wanted to make a programme based around Hudson and Rose immigrating to the United States. Jack Webb was interested in a series of Marsh and Gordon Jackson reprising their roles as head of a Los Angeles employment agency. Another idea, titled &quot;You Live or You Die&quot;, was to have Frederick Norton seeking his fortune in the U.S. Another idea followed Hudson, Mrs Bridges and Ruby running their seaside boarding house, and this probably would have been made had it not been for the death of Angela Baddeley on 22 February 1976. The only spin-off to make it onscreen was &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot;, broadcast in 1979, and it followed the adventures of Thomas and Sarah after they left Eaton Place. Although very popular, only one series was made as filming of a second series was postponed by strike action at ITV and never resumed. Only a few location scenes were shot and these were later wiped.

A short-lived series titled &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;, which aired in the fall of 1975, was loosely based upon &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;; its executive producer, Beryl Vertue, was Jean Marsh&#x27;s literary agent and had been responsible for helping sell the original &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; to LWT.

In 2011, the BBC ran a series titled &quot;Royal Upstairs Downstairs&quot; in which Tim Wonnacott and Rosemary Shrager tour country houses visited by Queen Victoria. Tim tours the upstairs concentrating on the architecture and events of Victoria&#x27;s visit, and Rosemary concentrates on the downstairs, demonstrating recipes cooked for the queen.

== Novelisations ==
Each series of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was accompanied by a novelisation, with additional detail in each, but also with some episodes missing. All books were published by Sphere Books. The novelisation of the first series, &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs or the secrets of an Edwardian household&quot;, was written by John Hawkesworth and published in 1972. Hawkesworth also wrote the series two novelisation, &quot;In My Lady&#x27;s Chamber&quot; and this was published in 1973. The following year, &quot;The Years of Change&quot;, Mollie Hardwick&#x27;s novelisation of the third series, was published and she also wrote the 1975 &quot;The War to End Wars&quot;, the fourth series novelisation. The fifth series, which was longer than the others, was novelised in two books, both by Michael Hardwick and published in 1975. They were titled &quot;On with the Dance&quot; and &quot;Endings and Beginnings&quot;.

As well as these novelisations, five books were separately published, again by Sphere Books, with each being the biography of a main character before the series started. &quot;Rose&#x27;s Story&quot; was written by Terence Brady &amp; Charlotte Bingham and published in 1972. The following year, Mollie Hardwick&#x27;s &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Story&quot; and Michael Hardwick&#x27;s &quot;Mr Hudson&#x27;s Diaries&quot; were both published. &quot;Mr Bellamy&#x27;s Story&quot;, by Michael Hardwick, was published in 1974 and &quot;Mrs Bridge&#x27;s Story&quot; by Mollie Hardwick was published in 1975. Also in 1975, &quot;The Upstairs, Downstairs Omnibus&quot;, featuring all five slightly edited stories, was published.

John Pearson published &quot;The Bellamys of Eaton Place&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Bellamy Saga&quot;) in 1976.

== Influence ==
The BBC series &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot; is widely seen as the BBC&#x27;s answer to &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;, not least because some of the same producers and writers worked on it, and it has a theme tune by Faris. The 1990 BBC sitcom &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; also featured a similar situation. In 1975, an American version, titled &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;, debuted but due to low ratings it was soon cancelled, running for just thirteen episodes. Tom Wolfe called the series a plutography, i.e. a &quot;graphic depiction of the lives of the rich&quot;.

A &quot;Monsterpiece Theater&quot; sketch on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, introduced/narrated by Cookie Monster (as Alistair Cookie, a play on Alistair Cooke, who was at that time the host of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot;) was titled &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and featured Grover running up and down a staircase until collapsing from exhaustion.

In 2000, a stop-motion animated series titled &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs Bears&quot;, co-produced by Canada&#x27;s Cinar and Scottish Television for the CITV block, was based upon &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. Ironically, it happened to air on the last day of London Weekend Television&#x27;s broadcasting under that brand (as part of the CITV block) on 27 October 2002; the next day LWT was subsumed into ITV London.

Company Pictures&#x27; 2008 television series &quot;The Palace&quot; has been described as a &quot;modern &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;&quot; as it features the points of view of both a fictional royal family and their servants.

From November 2008 to January 2010, variations (played in different styles, e.g., a fugue, jazz, calypso, death metal) of the theme music were played on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot; programme to introduce a segment titled &quot;Upshares, Downshares&quot;, in which Nils Blythe ran through the day&#x27;s business news. In November 2010, with the composer Alexander Faris&#x27;s blessing, a special CD of collected versions was released to raise money for the charity Children in Need.

The ITV series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, which ran from 2010 to 2015, has many similarities with &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs.&quot; Both series depict a noble family and their servants in the context of some of the same historical events; certain storylines and characterisations also appear in both series. In 2019, &quot;Downton Abbey&#x27;s&quot; executive producer Gareth Neame acknowledged the inspiration, stating that upon watching &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; for the first time as an adult, he realised that &quot;there&#x27;s two generations now who have got something new to be exposed to&quot; because they had never seen &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;.

== Revival ==

In 2009, the BBC announced it was to broadcast a revival of the series, with Jean Marsh reprising her role as Rose alongside a new cast in the same Eaton Place household. The series was created and written by Heidi Thomas. The first series aired from 26 December 2010. Eileen Atkins appeared in the first series, but left her role before production on the second series began.

== Home media ==
=== Region One DVDs===
&quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was first released to Region One DVD in December 2001 by A&amp;E Home Entertainment. During 2002, it released the remaining series and then released &quot;Thomas and Sarah&quot; on DVD in 2004. The individual releases have been collected into two boxed sets, the second of which, &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Edition Megaset&quot;, also includes &quot;Thomas and Sarah&quot;. These are all out of print. In 2011, Acorn Media released &quot;Upstairs Downstairs: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which includes &quot;Thomas and Sarah&quot; and 25 hours of special features in a 40th anniversary, 26-disc set.

=== Region Two DVDs===
&quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; was released on DVD by VCI in Region 2 (UK). The colour episodes of the first series were released in 2001 followed by the other series finishing in 2003. In 2004, the black-and-white episodes and the first episode with the original ending were released. &quot;Thomas &amp; Sarah&quot; was released in matching packaging in 2004. In 2005, VCI stopped making these DVDs, none of which had included any extras.

Network Video released the entire programme series-by-series from 2005 to 2006. The episodes were remastered and the black-and-white episodes were put in chronological order in the first series. Some episodes also featured audio commentaries, the LWT logo, commercial bumpers and the original preceding countdowns. In addition, each series was accompanied by a special one-hour documentary relating to that series featuring new and archive interviews. The fifth series release also featured the 1975 documentary &quot;Russell Harty goes... &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;&quot;. In 2006, a boxed set featuring all the DVDs was released.

DVDs of the series have also been released in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden.

=== Region Four DVDs===
Universal DVD released all five series to DVD in Australia and New Zealand. These later were deleted. Timelife issued the series as a mail-order collection. ITV began re-releasing the series in Australia in January 2013.

The show is rated PG in New Zealand for its low-level violence.

<doc id="860987" wikidata="Q764245" url="?curid=860987" title="Carbon black">
<text>Carbon black (with subtypes acetylene black, channel black, furnace black, lamp black and thermal black) is a material produced by the incomplete combustion of coal tar, vegetable matter, or petroleum products, including fuel oil, fluid catalytic cracking tar, and ethylene cracking in a limited supply of air. Carbon black is a form of paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit lower than that of activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. 

Carbon black is used as a colorant and reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products; pigment and wear protection additive in plastics, paints, and ink pigment. It is used in the EU as a food colorant when produced from vegetable matter (E153).

The current International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluation is that, &quot;Carbon black is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)&quot;. Short-term exposure to high concentrations of carbon black dust may produce discomfort to the upper respiratory tract through mechanical irritation.

==Common uses==
The most common use (70%) of carbon black is as a pigment and reinforcing phase in automobile tires. Carbon black also helps conduct heat away from the tread and belt area of the tire, reducing thermal damage and increasing tire life. Its low cost makes it a common addition to cathodes and anodes and is considered a safe replacement to lithium metal in lithium-ion batteries. About 20% of world production goes into belts, hoses, and other non-tire rubber goods. The remaining 10% use of carbon black comes from pigment in inks, coatings, and plastics, as well as being used as a conductive additive in lithium-ion batteries. 

Carbon black is added to polypropylene because it absorbs ultraviolet radiation, which otherwise causes the material to degrade. Carbon black particles are also employed in some radar absorbent materials, in photocopier and laser printer toner, and in other inks and paints. The high tinting strength and stability of carbon black has also provided use in coloring of resins and films. Carbon black has been used in various applications for electronics. A good conductor of electricity, carbon black is used as a filler mixed in plastics, elastomer, films, adhesives, and paints. It is used as an antistatic additive agent in automobile fuel caps and pipes.

Carbon black from vegetable origin is used as a food coloring, known in Europe as additive E153. It is approved for use as additive 153 (Carbon blacks or Vegetable carbon) in Australia and New Zealand but has been banned in the US. The color pigment carbon black has been widely used for many years in food and beverage packaging. It is used in multi-layer UHT milk bottles in the US, parts of Europe and Asia, and South Africa, and in items like microwavable meal trays and meat trays in New Zealand.

The Canadian Government&#x27;s extensive review of carbon black in 2011 concluded that carbon black could continue to be used in products – including food packaging for consumers – in Canada. This was because &quot;in most consumer products carbon black is bound in a matrix and unavailable for exposure, for example as a pigment in plastics and rubbers&quot; and &quot;it is proposed that carbon black is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentrations or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health.&quot;

Within Australasia, the color pigment carbon black in packaging must comply with the requirements of either the EU or US packaging regulations. If any colorant is used, it must meet European partial agreement AP(89)1.

Total production was around in 2006. Global consumption of carbon black, estimated at 13.2 million metric tons, valued at US$13.7 billion, in 2015, is expected to reach 13.9 million metric tons, valued at US$14.4 billion in 2016.

While distinct from soot and similar particulates, carbon black can be used as a model compound for diesel soot to better understand how diesel soot behaves under various reaction conditions. Carbon black and diesel soot have some similar properties such as particle sizes, densities, and copolymer adsorption abilities that contribute to them having similar behaviours under various reactions such as oxidation experiments.

Global consumption is forecast to maintain a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 5.6% between 2016 and 2022, reaching 19.2 million metric tons, valued at US$20.4 billion, by 2022.

==Reinforcing carbon blacks==
The highest volume use of carbon black is as a reinforcing filler in rubber products, especially tires. While a pure gum vulcanization of styrene-butadiene has a tensile strength of no more than 2 MPa and negligible abrasion resistance, compounding it with 50% carbon black by weight improves its tensile strength and wear resistance as shown in the table below. It is used often in the aerospace industry in elastomers for aircraft vibration control components such as engine mounts.

Practically all rubber products where tensile and abrasion wear properties are important use carbon black, so they are black in color. Where physical properties are important but colors other than black are desired, such as white tennis shoes, precipitated or fumed silica has been substituted for carbon black. Silica-based fillers are also gaining market share in automotive tires because they provide better trade-off for fuel efficiency and wet handling due to a lower rolling loss. Traditionally silica fillers had worse abrasion wear properties, but the technology has gradually improved to a point where they can match carbon black abrasion performance.

==Pigment==
Carbon black (Color Index International, PBK-7) is the name of a common black pigment, traditionally produced from charring organic materials such as wood or bone. It appears black because it reflects very little light in the visible part of the spectrum, with an albedo near zero. The actual albedo varies depending on the source material and method of production. It is known by a variety of names, each of which reflects a traditional method for producing carbon black:
* Ivory black was traditionally produced by charring ivory or bones (see bone char).
* Vine black was traditionally produced by charring desiccated grape vines and stems.
* Lamp black was traditionally produced by collecting soot from oil lamps.

All of these types of carbon black were used extensively as paint pigments since prehistoric times. Rembrandt, Vermeer, Van Dyck, and more recently, Cézanne, Picasso and Manet employed carbon black pigments in their paintings. A typical example is Manet&#x27;s &quot;Music in the Tuileries&quot;, where the black dresses and the men&#x27;s hats are painted in ivory black.

Newer methods of producing carbon black have largely superseded these traditional sources. For artisanal purposes, carbon black produced by any means remains common.

== Surface and surface chemistry ==
All carbon blacks have chemisorbed oxygen complexes (i.e., carboxylic, quinonic, lactonic, phenolic groups and others) on their surfaces to varying degrees depending on the conditions of manufacture. These surface oxygen groups are collectively referred to as volatile content. It is also known to be a non-conductive material due to its volatile content.

The coatings and inks industries prefer grades of carbon black that are acid-oxidized. Acid is sprayed in high-temperature dryers during the manufacturing process to change the inherent surface chemistry of the black. The amount of chemically-bonded oxygen on the surface area of the black is increased to enhance performance characteristics.

== Use in lithium-ion batteries ==

Carbon black is a common conductive additive for lithium-ion batteries as the particles have small sizes and a large specific surface areas (SSA) which allow for the additive to be well distributed throughout the cathode or anode in addition to being cheap and long-lasting. Unlike graphite, which is one of the other common materials used in chargeable batteries, carbon black consists of crystal lattices that are further apart and promotes Li+ intercalation because it allows more pathways for lithium storage.

Carbon black has a low density that allows for a large volume of it to be dispersed so that its conductive effects are applied evenly throughout the battery. Furthermore, its arrangement of randomly distributed graphite-like crystals improves battery stability because of the decrease in the potential barrier of lithium intercalation into graphite, which ultimately affects the performance of cathodes.

While carbon black is lightweight and well dispersed throughout the battery and increases the conductive performance of batteries, it also contains oxygen containing hydrophilic functional groups that can cause side reactions to occur in the battery and lead to the decomposition of electrolyte. Graphitization (heating) of carbon black can thermally decompose the hydrophilic functional groups and thus increase the cycle life of the battery which maintains the conductive abilities of carbon black while mitigating the damage that can be caused to batteries by hydrophilic functional groups. 

Half cells created with heavy graphitization, light graphitization, and no graphitization showed that the cell created with heavy graphitization had a stable cycle life of 320 cycles, the cell with light graphitization showed a stable cycle life of 200 cycles, and the cell with no graphitization showed a stable cycle life of 160 cycles.

== Safety ==
===Carcinogenicity===
Carbon black is considered &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; and classified as a Group 2B carcinogen because there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals with inadequate evidence in human epidemiological studies. The evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies comes from two chronic inhalation studies and two intratracheal instillation studies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. An inhalation study on mice did not show significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic data comes from three cohort studies of carbon black production workers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000 workers in each study group showed elevated mortality from lung cancer. A third study of over 5,000 carbon black workers in the United States did not show elevated mortality. Newer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK study suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However, a more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis.

=== Occupational safety ===
There are strict guidelines available and in place to ensure employees who manufacture carbon black are not at risk of inhaling unsafe doses of carbon black in its raw form. Respiratory personal protective equipment is recommended to properly protect workers from inhalation of carbon black. The recommended type of respiratory protection varies depending on the concentration of carbon black used.

People can be exposed to carbon black in the workplace by inhalation and contact with the skin or eyes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for carbon black exposure in the workplace at 3.5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 3.5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1750 mg/m3, carbon black is immediately dangerous to life and health.

<text>Sandgate is a northern coastal suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Sandgate had a population of 4,926 people.

The town became a popular destination for the people of Brisbane in the early 20th century and remains popular due to its coastline, including Lovers Walk along the bay between Sandgate and neighbouring Shorncliffe as well as Moora Park and Beach.

== Geography ==
Sandgate is situated on the coastline, along Bramble Bay part of Moreton Bay. The western border of the suburb is marked by the Gateway Motorway.

The Shorncliffe railway line (part of the Queensland Rail City network) enters the suburb from the south-west (Deagon) and exits to the south (Shorncliffe) with Sandgate railway station in Chubb Street off Rainbow Street () serving the suburb.

The Deagon Wetlands are in the west of the suburb (); they are part of the North East Wetlands of Brisbane.

Dowse Lagoon is in the centre of the suburb (). It was officially named on 15 November 1975 after Thomas Dowse who settled in the Sandgate area in 1853. Einbunpin Lagoon is a smaller lagoon to the south-east of Dowse Lagoon ().

== History ==
The Turrbul people inhabited the seashore, the creeks and lagoons from Nudgee Beach to the Pine River. They were a branch of the clan of the Yugarabul speaking people. This larger clan inhabited the area from North Brisbane and along the coastline of Nudgee, Sandgate to Caboolture. In their language the local Turrbal clan called their coastal land &quot;Warra&quot; meaning &quot;an open sheet of water&quot;. This land is now called Shorncliffe, Sandgate and Brighton. Their existence depended upon their knowledge of the seasons and their surroundings. Spears, nullas and boomerangs were used in hunting and woven nets for fishing.

The British settlers originally called the area Cabbage Tree Creek (after the creek).

The town was named &quot;Sandgate&quot; by James Burnett, an early surveyor in the region after the seaside town of Sandgate in Kent, England. Sandgate in Kent had a military camp, Shorncliffe Camp, on top of the cliffs adjacent to it. Sandgate in Brisbane has an adjacent suburb called Shorncliffe named after the camp in Kent, again by Burnett, after the similarity of the cliffs.

Land in Sandgate became available on 9 November 1853, allowing a small seaside settlement to develop. One of the first structures built at Sandgate was a Native Police barracks, from where officers such as the Frederick Wheeler conducted punitive raids against local aboriginals.

On 25 May 1872, Robert Travers Atkin, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, died at Sandgate following an illness of some months. At his request, At his request, he was buried in Sandgate on the crest of the rise on which he had enjoyed sitting under the shade of the trees and looking out onto Moreton Bay. His will provided £50 to build a church beside his grave. This church was the first St Margaret&#x27;s church (and is now used as the rectory). A monument was erected to his memory by the members of the Hibernian Society of Queensland, of which he was vice-president.
In August 1873, a public meeting was held to establish a school. There were about 50 school-age children in Sandgate and nearly £70 was donated towards the establishment of a school. Sandgate State School opened on 15 September 1873 under teacher William R. Barfoot in the chapel of the first Baptist Church in Loudon Street (not to be confused with the Sandgate Baptist Church in Flinders Street which opened in 1887). The first permanent school building opened in 1874.
By 1874, coach services connected Sandgate to Brisbane.

In December 1879, allotments in the Town of Sandgate were auctioned by John Cameron. A map advertising the auction states the land available was subdivisions 1 to 14, of allotments 8, 9, 10 and part of 7, Sec. 3, Town of Sandgate. The map shows allotments bordered by Friday, Yundah and Kate Streets, now in Shorncliffe.

In January 1880, a plan of subdivisions 1 to 32 of Portion 73, Town of Sandgate, was advertised for sale, with interested persons to apply to William Potts, Queen Street, Brisbane. The map advertising the sale includes the location of the proposed railway terminus, and situates the proposed subdivisions between a lagoon and the esplanade. Newspaper advertisements describe the proposed subdivisions as &quot;choice marine villa sites&quot;.

On 29 April 1880, Sandgate was proclaimed a municipality known as the Borough of Sandgate. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions and Boroughs with Towns and Shires, creating the Town of Sandgate on 31 March 1903. This new status meant a town council was formed to guide the development of the local area. Initially, the council chambers were located in Shorncliffe. However, following a fire which destroyed the council chambers in 1910, a much larger town hall was opened in 1911. The Sandgate Town Hall was extensively renovated in 2011 to mark the 100th anniversary of the hall. The Sandgate Town Council, which operated from 1880 to 1925, had to provide a range of services for the growing community. These included a fire department, ambulance, and sanitation facilities, as well as maintaining roads and regulating local development. In October 1925 the Town of Sandgate was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

A Church of England was built in Signal Row on the corner of Yundah Street (), then the centre of the developing town. It was opened and dedicated on Sunday 12 December 1880 by Bishop Matthew Hale. It was a timber church and able to accommodate 150 people. It was designed by architect FDG Stanley and built by contractors Woodward and Betts of Brisbane. In September 1886 it was announced that it would be dedicated to St Nicolas, the patron saint of sailors and sea-farers, a common practice in seaside towns. In 1887 it was enlarged which involved re-orienting the building on the block so the chancel was to the south rather than to the original east. In 1930 the undercroft was enclosed with bricks to form a church wall. The church closed in 1988. The Queensland Government purchased the church and incorporated it into Shorncliffe State School but subsequently demolished it due to extensive termite damage. Its stained glass windows were preserved and are now in St Margaret&#x27;s Anglican Church.

The first Catholic Church was opened on 25 September 1881. It was a small brick building which remains in use as the office of the Sacred Heart Primary School.

The coming of the railway in 1882 promoted more rapid development of the Sandgate area. Travel to Brisbane by train could be completed in less than half an hour.

On 12 August 1882 the Garden Estate, Sandgate was advertised for auction by James R. Dickson. An estate map shows the 61 blocks making up the estate at the area bounded by Rainbow and Friday Streets.

The Sandgate Baptist church opened on the corner of Cliff Street and Flinders Parade in 1887. It has since undergone multiple restorations, yet has continued to remain in its original structure. It is no longer operating as a church, being now used as a child care centre.

On Sunday 25 September 1892, the new Sacred Heart Catholic Church was opened and blessed by Cardinal Francis Moran assisted by Archibshop of Brisbane Robert Dunne. The former church building was to be used to establish a school.

Sacred Heart Catholic School opened on Monday 23 January 1893 in the former church. It opened with an initial enrolment of 50 students was operated by three Sisters of Mercy from the All Hallows&#x27; Convent in Fortitude Valley. The first principal was Sister Mary Borgia. The school also provided boarding facilities for some years. A purpose-built school building was constructed in 1920. The school provided secondary education until 1980 when St John Fisher College opened in neighbouring Bracken Ridge. In 1995 principal Sister Mary O&#x27;Donoghue retired and Glenda Honan was appointed as the first lay principal.

Land for a Methodist church was purchased in Brighton in 1914. In January 1917, a small Sunday school was opened on the site. In 1919, a Methodist church building was relocated from Killarney (where it had opened in 1902) to the Brighton site, where it was erected and officially opened on Saturday 5 June 1920. On Saturday 2 December 1939, 500 people attended the opening of a new church building by Reverend F. A. Malcolm, the President of the Methodist Conference. The previous church was relocated to the rear of the site to be used as a Sunday school hall. In 1977, the church joined in the amalgamation that created the Uniting Church in Australia becoming the Brighton Uniting Church. The church at 41 Deagon Street () was closed circa 1999, and was later sold and the church and hall (the former church) were converted into a house. It is now within the suburb boundaries of Sandgate. It is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register.

On 27 December 1920, 33 building sites in the Nashville Heights Estate were advertised for auction by Lyons &amp; Coaldrake. A map showing the allotments, which are in the area currently bounded by Alexandra Street, Nash Street, Darling Street and Borella Street, notes the blocks&#x27; proximity to the Sandgate Central Station, beach, state school and post office.
Sandgate boasted clean beaches that were a popular weekend destination, with thousands of people visiting from Brisbane to escape the heat. Boating, swimming and golf were the most common sporting activities. Moora Park () was the location for dances and open-air films.

Sandgate Library opened in 1952 with a major refurbishment in 1996.

The Sandgate Little Theatre Group was established in 1958. They perform in the Sandgate Town Hall. Now known as Sandgate Theatre Incorporated, this community theatre group hosts Brisbane&#x27;s longest running community theatre festival, the Yarrageh Drama Festival, which is held in August and September each year at the town hall.

Sandgate Infants State School was separated from Sandgate State School in 1955. It was amalgamated back into Sandgate State School in 1971.

Sandgate District State High School opened on 26 January 1959. Due to delays in the construction of the first school building, the first classes were taught in the Sandgate Town Hall.

Sandgate Opportunity School opened on 26 April 1960. It was later renamed Sandgate Special School. It closed on 15 December 1995.

In June 1990, the Uniting Church in Australia congregations of Boondall, Brighton, Sandgate and Shorncliffe decided to amalgamate. Their new Sandgate Uniting Church in Deagon was opened in Sunday 20 November 1994.

<text>The William Morris Gallery is a museum devoted to the life and works of William Morris, an English Arts and Crafts designer and early socialist. It is located in Walthamstow at Water House, a substantial Grade II* listed Georgian home. The extensive grounds of the building are a public park, known as Lloyd Park.

==Collections and exhibits==

The William Morris Gallery holds the most comprehensive collection of objects relating to all aspects of Morris&#x27;s life and work, including his work as a designer, a writer and a social activist.

The permanent exhibit is divided into 9 rooms:
*&quot;1. Meet the Man&quot;, Morris&#x27; early life and background; 
*&quot;2. Starting Out&quot;, Morris&#x27; early works and his influences including Pre-Raphaelite artists and Art Critic John Ruskin;
*&quot;3. Morris &amp; Co&quot;, the formation and ideal&#x27;s of Morris&#x27; design company; 
*&quot;4. The Workshop&quot;, the design and manufacturing techniques championed by Morris; 
*&quot;5. The Shop&quot;, an interactive gallery exploring the experience of shopping for Morris&#x27; creations in Victorian London; 
*&quot;6. Ideal Book&quot;, Morris&#x27; foray into printing and book design includes an original printing of Earthly Paradise by William Morris;
*&quot;7. Fighting for a Cause&quot;, Morris&#x27; social activism and socialist beliefs; 
*&quot;8. Arts and Crafts&quot;, the movement that Morris founded; 
*&quot;9. Frank Brangwyn&quot;, works from the student of William Morris.

The museum is also used as a learning facility with educational exhibitions from artists such as Eamon Everall of the stuckist movement.

==History==

Water House was constructed in 1762 and was Morris&#x27; family home in his teenage years from 1848 to 1856. The building and its grounds were sold on to newspaper proprietor Edward Lloyd in 1856, whose son donated the house and grounds (which then became Lloyd Park) to Walthamstow in 1900. The building was not opened as a museum until 1950, by Prime Minister Clement Attlee.
In 2007, as a result of cost saving exercises, by owners Waltham Forest Borough Council, the museum&#x27;s opening hours were cut back to allow staffing to be reduced. This broke a &quot;stipulation of gifts&quot; by Sir Frank Brangwyn, that works should be on view for a minimum amount of time weekly. And a number of campaigners, including former Culture Secretary Chris Smith, were concerned that this would lead to the museum&#x27;s closure.

===Redevelopment===
In March 2009 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the gallery £80,000 to enable detailed proposals for redevelopment. In Autumn 2010 this proposal was successful in securing a second funding of £1.523 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which was matched with £1.5 million from the London Borough of Waltham Forest. Subsequently, a major redevelopment was carried out.

The building was closed for refurbishment and redevelopment in 2011 and was reopened in August 2012.

The redevelopment of Water House, designed by architects and exhibition designers Pringle Richards Sharratt, included a new wing &quot;inspired by Georgian &amp; Victorian precedents&quot; containing a gallery for temporary exhibitions as well as a tearoom with windows incorporating a Morris ‘Thistle’ frit pattern and a balcony that overlooks the gardens.

Grayson Perry&#x27;s fifteen-metre long Walthamstow Tapestry was displayed for the first month after reopening.

===Recognition===

In 2013 the William Morris Gallery won national prizes for Museum of the Year, and the &quot;Museum and Heritage Shows&quot;&#x27;s award for Best Permanent Exhibition.

==Lloyd Park==

The gardens of Water House, now known as Lloyd Park, are a public park maintained by Waltham Forest Borough Council. The park includes an area surrounded by a moat which pre-dates the Georgian house.

The park&#x27;s facilities include a café, public toilets, artist studios, a play area, a bowls pavilion, tennis courts, skate park and basketball practice areas. The park also hosts a regular food market, &quot;Lloyd Park Market&quot;.

=== Waltham Forest Theatre===
A pavilion was built in 1937, on the artificial island created by the moat, and converted into the &quot;Waltham Forest Theatre&quot; in 1972. The theatre was popular through to the 1990s and local actor Jack Watling presented several seasons of plays there. However, it eventually fell into disuse and was demolished in 2011 as part of wider redevelopment.

<text>The Chrysler B and RB engines are a series of big-block V8 gasoline engines introduced in 1958 to replace the Chrysler FirePower (first generation Hemi) engines. The B and RB engines are often referred to as &quot;wedge&quot; engines because they use wedge-shaped combustion chambers; this differentiates them from Chrysler&#x27;s 426 Hemi big block engines that are typically referred to as &quot;Hemi&quot; or &quot;426 Hemi&quot; due to their hemispherical shaped combustion chambers. The corporation had been seeking a smaller and lighter replacement for its FirePower engines, in part because new styling dictates meant moving the engine forward in the chassis which negatively affected weight distribution.

==Design==
Design features of the B and RB engines include 17 capscrews per cylinder head, a cylinder block that extends below the crankshaft centerline, an intake manifold not exposed to crankcase oil on the underside, stamped-steel shaft-mounted rocker arms (race versions used forged steel rockers), and a front-mounted external oil pump driven by the camshaft. In order to provide a lower hood and center of gravity, the engine to be mounted lower than before. Apart from changing the engine dimensions and engine mount position, this also entailed reconsidering the distributor drive and oil pump locations. The oil pump could not be allowed to extend below the crank throw to avoid interfering with the steering linkage. The engineers moved the distributor to the front of the engine, at a 45-degree angle, which cleared the heater while allowing the oil pump to be located in front of the block - above the bottom of the crank&#x27;s throw, clearing the steering linkage.

The &#x27;B&#x27; series wedge engine was introduced in 1958 with and versions. The 361 would continue in production until the end of the series, albeit only for truck installation. The RB (&quot;raised B&quot;) arrived one year after the launch of the B series engines, in and displacements. Unlike the previous B-engines, which had a stroke, the RB engines had a stroke.

For 1960, a &quot;ram induction&quot; system increased the 413&#x27;s torque up to on the Chrysler 300F versions.

The last &#x27;B-RB&#x27; wedge-headed engine was produced in August 1978, ending the era of Chrysler &quot;big-block&quot; engines.

==B engines==
All Low Block B-series engines have a stroke, a deck height and connecting rods, resulting in a 1.88:1 rod ratio.

===350===
The B engine was, along with the 361, the first production B engine, first available in 1958. It had a bore of . The 350 is classified as a big-block engine. All parts except for the pistons are fully compatible with the 361.

Vehicles using the B 350:

* 1958 DeSoto Firesweep
* 1958 Dodge Coronet
* 1958 Plymouth Fury

===361===
The 361 cu in B engine also introduced in 1958 was essentially the same as the 350 except with a larger bore, for an actual displacement of . In 1962, the Dodge Polara 500 came standard with a version of the 361 that had a four-barrel carburetor, dual-point distributor, and dual exhausts. Plymouth called their versions of the early B engine the &quot;Commando&quot;, variants of which included the &quot;Golden Commando&quot; and &quot;Sonoramic Commando&quot;. It produced . DeSoto&#x27;s B engine was named &quot;Turboflash&quot; and produced . The Dodge standard version was a 2-barrel with called the &quot;Super Red Ram&quot; with an optional variant that was called the &quot;D500&quot; and produced .

The 361 would last until the end of the series, albeit for trucks only. In its early years, the 305-horsepower 361 was optional on many vehicles, and standard on, among others, the Dodge 880. The 361 had a fuel-injected version in 1958 only. Very few of the fuel-injected B engines were made and only a handful remain, since most were brought back to the dealer to be fitted with carburetors.

===383===

The 383 cu in B engine—not to be confused with the RB version—was essentially a larger bore version of the 350 and 361, using a bore for a displacement. This venerable engine was introduced in 1959. Dodge&#x27;s version, the &quot;D500&quot;, had a cross-ram induction manifold and dual four-barrel carburetors as options. In some Dodge applications, this engine was labeled as the &quot;Magnum&quot;, while the Plymouth version was called the &quot;Golden Commando&quot;. Both came with a dual point distributor in high-performance versions.

The 383 became the standard model Mopar performance engine for the next decade. The big bore allowed for larger, , intake valves, and the relatively short stroke helped it to be a free-revving and free-breathing engine.

Producing a maximum of (gross) and of torque for the 1960 model year, the 383 beat the 392 Hemi that had reached . The 1960 383 engines featured the same basic ram induction system as the Chrysler 300F&#x27;s 413 RB engines (named &quot;Sonoramic Commando&quot; when sold in Plymouth form). The later 383 Magnum (starting in 1968) used the 440 Magnum heads, camshaft, and exhaust manifolds. This engine was advertised at .

===400===
The B engine was introduced in 1972 to replace the venerable 383, and were power-rated via the net (installed) method. Chrysler increased the bore size of the 383 to create the 400. Its bore of was the largest used in any production Chrysler V8 at the date of its introduction. All parts except for the pistons were interchangeable between the 383 and 400.

Crankshafts were made of cast iron. Three versions of this engine were available: a two-barrel/single-exhaust version producing at 4,400 rpm and of torque at 2,400 rpm, a four-barrel/single-exhaust version producing at 4,400 rpm, and a high-performance four-barrel/dual-exhaust version rated at at 4,800 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm. All three versions used the same 8.2:1 compression ratio. The 400 was used in car, truck, and motorhome chassis. Horsepower and torque ratings gradually declined through the years because of the addition of more federally mandated emissions controls, until all Chrysler passenger vehicle big-block production ceased in 1978. For its last year of production, it only produced (although a heavy-duty version was also available).

Due to its large factory bore size, short (compared to RB engines) deck height, and bottom end strength that is greater than any other production B or RB engine due to extra material added around the main bearing caps, 400 B engine blocks have become a popular choice for high-performance engine build-ups.

==RB engines==
The &quot;RB&quot; engines, produced from 1959 to 1979, are raised-block (taller) versions of the B engines. All RB engines have a stroke, with the bore being the defining factor in engine size. All RB wedge engines share a deck height of , and were fitted with long connecting rods, resulting in a 1.80:1 rod ratio. Bore center distance is . All RBs are oversquare.

=== 383===

Not to be confused with the 383 &quot;B&quot; engine, the 383 &quot;RB&quot; had a bore combined with the long stroke of , for a displacement of . It was only available in 1959 and 1960 on the U.S.-built Chrysler Windsors and Saratogas; one of Trenton Engine&#x27;s lines had been converted to the new RB engine (to make the 413), and demand for the 383 B engine was too high for the remaining line. The solution was to create a 383 RB to fill the gap until the plant figured out how to quickly switch from one block to the other.

===413===
The RB was used from 1959 to 1965 in cars. It was also used in medium and heavy trucks including truck-tractors such as the C-1000, up until 1979. It has a bore of 4.1875 inches. During that period, it powered almost all Chrysler New Yorker and all Imperial models, and was also available on the lesser Chryslers, Dodge Polara, Dodge Monaco, and Plymouth Fury as an alternative to the B-block 383 and the A-block 318. It was also fitted to some European cars such as the later Facel Vega Facel II.

In the 1959 Chrysler 300E, the 413 wedge was fitted with inline dual four-barrel carburetors; it was factory-rated at at 5,000 rpm and at 3,600 rpm. In 1960, a long-tube ram induction system was made standard on the Chrysler 300. It continued as standard on the 1961 300-G, and remained on the option sheets for Chrysler 300s through 1964. In 1962, a special version known as the &quot;Max Wedge&quot; was made available for drag racing and street use; this version produced at 5,000 rpm.
===426 Wedge===

Not to be confused with the 426 Hemi, the RB was a wedge-head RB block with a bore. The 426 Wedge served as Chrysler&#x27;s main performance engine until the introduction of the 426 Hemi. It was initially offered as the &quot;non-catalogued&quot; option S42 in Chryslers (the number of such produced is uncertain), offered with via a single 4-barrel carburetor (11.0:1 or 12.0:1 compression ratio, respectively), or via ram-inducted dual four-barrel carburetors (with the same compression ratios). For 1963, horsepower ratings would slightly increase (see below), and it became optional in B-bodied Dodges and Plymouths. After 1963, it would be used only in Dodges and Plymouths.

The Max Wedge was a race-only version of the 426 Wedge engine offered from the factory. Known as the Super Stock Plymouth and Ramcharger Dodge, the Max Wedge featured high-flow cylinder heads developed through then state-of-the-art airflow testing. It had exhaust valves, which required the cylinder bores to be notched for clearance. The blocks were a special severe-duty casting with larger oil-feed passages than other RB engines, and were stress-relieved by the factory. Induction came by means of a cross-ram intake manifold tuned for peak power above 4000 rpm and two Carter AFB-3447SA 4-barrel carburetors. The Max Wedge also included high-flow cast-iron exhaust manifolds that, on the later versions, resembled steel tube headers. The Max Wedge was factory rated at (depending on compression), and at 4400 rpm.

Before the end of the 1963 model year, Chrysler introduced the Stage II Max Wedge with improved combustion chamber design and an improved camshaft. The last performance year for the Max Wedge was the 1964 Stage III. The factory-advertised power rating never changed despite the Stage II and III improvements.

A &quot;426 Street Wedge&quot; engine was also available in 1964 and 1965. An increased-bore version of the standard New Yorker 413 single 4-barrel engine, it bears little relation to the Max Wedge except for basic architecture and dimensions. It was available only in B-body cars (Plymouth and Dodge) and light-duty Dodge D Series trucks.

===440===
The RB was produced from 1965 until 1978, making it the last version of the Chrysler RB block. It had a light wall construction, precision cast-iron block, with iron heads and a bore of , for an overall displacement of .

From 1967 to 1971, the high-performance version was rated at ( in 1971) at 4,600 rpm and at 3,200 rpm of torque with a single 4-barrel carburetor, and from 1969 to 1971, the highest-output version had an intake setup with 3×2-barrel Holley carburetors (&quot;440 Six Pack&quot; for Dodge, &quot;440 6-BBL&quot; for Plymouth) producing at 4,700 rpm ( in 1971) and at 3,200 rpm of torque.

In 1972, changes were made to the horsepower ratings of vehicle engines from gross (engine only, without air cleaner, exhaust system, alternator, or other power-consuming components) to net (with alternator, air cleaner, mufflers, and other vehicle equipment installed). The new rating system produced lower, more realistic numbers for any given engine. At the same time, emissions regulations were demanding cleaner exhaust. Engines including the 440 were made with reduced compression, modified cam timing, and other tuning measures to comply with the newly tightened emissions regulations. The 1972 440 produced (gross) at 4400 rpm; the new net rating was —which very closely coincided with period German DIN ratings and TÜV measurements.

The high-output 440 (4-barrel/mild cam/dual exhausts) was marketed as the &quot;Magnum&quot; in Dodges, the &quot;Super Commando&quot; in Plymouths, and the &quot;TNT&quot; in Chryslers. From 1972 to 1974, the engine (detuned to run on unleaded gasoline) was rated at net, and dropped in horsepower each year until 1978, when it was rated at (in police specification) and limited to Chrysler New Yorkers, Chrysler Newports, Dodge Monaco Police Pursuits, and Plymouth Fury Police Pursuits. It was also available in marine and heavy-duty commercial applications until that year.

<doc id="861006" wikidata="Q348607" url="?curid=861006" title="Adam Aircraft Industries">
<text>Adam Aircraft Industries (AAI) was an aircraft manufacturer founded by George F. Adam Jr and John C. Knudsen in 1998. The company was located at Centennial Airport in the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area of Colorado, United States.

The company certified and produced the inline piston twin-engined Adam A500, while the turbofan-powered Adam A700 AdamJet was under development. The A700 was intended to be an entrant into the niche of Very Light Jets (VLJs), but its development was ceased before production was achieved.

One of the first Adam A500s manufactured, A500 s/n 0002, was featured in the 2006 Michael Mann film &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

In conjunction with partners, the company had won a major contract from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the development of a next-generation rotorcraft, indicating possible longer-term product development potential. However, the firm ceased operations on 11 February 2008, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on 15 February 2008.

In April 2008, the assets of the former company were purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc. AAI failed to restart Adam Aircraft and in April 2009 Adam Aircraft finally ceased operations and laid off all its staff.

In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they had acquired the company&#x27;s assets.

==History==

===Financial problems and cessation of operations===
In January 2008 it was announced that Adam Aircraft was having problems raising the capital required to complete certification flight testing of the A700 jet and to enter full production of the A500 piston aircraft. As a result, the company closed its Ogden, Utah plant and laid off 300 workers.

Adam Aircraft President Duncan Koerbel was quoted as saying:

&quot;To provide for our future growth, we must be strategic in our focus by managing current cash expenditures to ensure adequate time to secure financing for the long term. We&#x27;re off to a good start in this effort with assistance from our partner, Citibank, but we need to be able to provide them with sufficient time working with potential investors to secure long term financing.&quot;

The company indicated that it needed to raise between USD$75 and $150 million to produce the A500 and complete certification of the A700.

In a 22 January 2008 letter to shareholders, company CEO John Wolf indicated that the company would face &quot;liquidation&quot; if it could not raise an additional USD$25M in the seven days that remained before the end of that month, because the company had loans due and could not pay them without the additional funds.

On 11 February 2008 the company ceased operations, issuing a short news release that it was &quot;due to the inability of the company to come to terms with their lender for funding necessary to maintain business operations.&quot;

On 14 February 2008 it was reported that employees of the company were optimistic that operations would be able to continue under new financing. At the same time aviation anonymous industry leaders interviewed by the aviation press expressed opinions that the company would not be saved and that there would be no choice but to have it liquidated. This prediction turned out correct, as the company filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 on 15 February 2008

The government of the City of Pueblo, Colorado demanded that USD$2M in financial incentives paid to firm be returned. As part of its agreement with the city, Adam Aircraft had agreed to create 448 jobs, but had only created 90 jobs, almost all eliminated in the round of lay-offs in January, preceding closure. The city filed liens against Adam Aircraft&#x27;s physical equipment to recover the money owed.

===AAI Acquisition===
On April 11, 2008, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado approved the sale of the company for $10 million to AAI Acquisition Inc an entity jointly controlled by Russian firms Industrial Investors and Kaskol.
Industrial Investors is a private equity management company with $3 billion in assets, notably Far East Shipping Company. According to their statement, former Colorado Governor Bill Owens is a director of one of its companies. At the time of purchase, AAI VP Dmitry Shokhin said: &quot;We plan to revive Adam Aircraft&#x27;s operations, including continuing the process of certification for the A700 jet&quot;.

Industrial Investments had reportedly ordered 75 A700s prior to Adam Aircraft&#x27;s bankruptcy, and restarted work on the A700 with 60 employees back at work by May 2008.

According to a July 2008 statement by Sergey Generalov, CEO and owner of Industrial Investors, more than ten other companies had bid for the assets of bankrupt AAI. prior to the tender the company made a deal with 50 Adams engineers, persuading them to stay with AAI, thus securing the winning bid. In addition to the US$10 million purchase price, Generalov expected to invest another US$150 million before the project would generate any return.

The new company confirmed at AirVenture 2008 that they would proceed with certification of the A700 and had indicated an initial forecast completion date in the first quarter of 2010. The company also confirmed that they would not produce the A500 for the foreseeable future, due to the global drop in demand for piston-engined aircraft

Citing the economic crisis of 2008 AAI Acquisition President and CEO Jack Braly announced on 28 October 2008 that A700 &quot;Flight test and other development activity have been suspended&quot;. Braly indicated that the company&#x27;s investment team and board of directors were reviewing the economic and market conditions and would decide on a new schedule for certifying the A700.

The company laid off 200 employees in October 2008, leaving 30 engineering staff at work.

In January 2009 the company announced it was seeking a new strategic partner to help it expand into new areas of business: sub-contract engineering and manufacturing for the aerospace and custom automotive industry, projects that could make use of the company&#x27;s expertise in composite design and manufacturing. The company said that it had not abandoned the A700 jet project. Company Vice President of Business Development Steve Patrick said: &quot;Based on our initial efforts, we are building a viable business base for our engineering solutions and services while retaining the option to re-launch the A700 business jet.&quot;

In April 2009, unable to find non-aerospace work for its facilities, new partners and out of operating capital, AAI Acquisition closed Adam Aircraft and laid off the last of its staff.

===Triton America===
In July 2009, real estate developer Thomas Hsueh purchased the remaining tooling, parts, and intellectual property of Adam Aircraft from the Russian investors. Doing business as Triton America LLC, in Anacortes, Washington, his company planned to redesign the A500 and A700, and return the aircraft to production at the Port of Skagit County, Skagit County, Washington.

In April 2011 Triton Aerospace of Skagit Regional Airport in Burlington, Washington announced that they had acquired the assets of Adam Aircraft. The company announced that it intended to return the A500 to production after re-engineering it to lose of empty weight and recertifying it. The aircraft will also be changed to a turboprop, with twin-engined and rear-engined-only versions. Two new prototypes were expected in 2013 with re-certification to follow. The company owner, Thomas Hsueh, indicated that for now production is planned for the US, but costs may require moving the assembly line to China, or even a lower cost country, such as Mexico. Triton indicated that they have no plans to produce the A700 jet.

<doc id="861009" wikidata="Q132431" url="?curid=861009" title="Grigory Shelikhov">
<text>Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov (Григорий Иванович Шелихов in Russian) (1747, Rylsk, Belgorod Governorate – July 20, 1795 (July 31, 1795 New Style)) was a Russian seafarer, merchant, and fur trader who established a permanent settlement in Alaska.

== Career ==
Starting in 1775, Shelikhov organized voyages of merchant ships to the Kuril Islands and the Aleutian Islands, in what is now Alaska, for fur trading. In 1783–1786, he led an expedition to the coastal shores of the mainland, where they founded the first permanent Russian settlements in North America. Shelikhov&#x27;s voyage was done under the auspices of his Shelikhov-Golikov Company, the other owner of which was Ivan Larionovich Golikov. This company was the predecessor of the Russian-American Company, which was founded in 1799.

In April 1784, Shelikhov arrived in what he named as Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island with two ships, the &quot;Three Hierarchs, Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom&quot; and the &quot;St. Simon.&quot; The indigenous Koniaga, an Alutiiq nation of Alaska Natives, defended themselves from the Russian party. In what became known as the Awa&#x27;uq Massacre, Shelikhov and his armed forces, who had guns and cannons, killed hundreds of the Alutiiq, including women and children. They also took hundreds of hostages, many of them children, to force submission by other Alaska Natives. Having established his authority on Kodiak Island, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in Alaska along the island&#x27;s Three Saints Bay. (Unalaska had been established long before, but it was not considered the permanent base for Russians until Shelikhov&#x27;s time.)

In 1790, Shelikhov, having returned to Russia, hired Alexandr Baranov to manage his fur trading enterprise in Russian America.

A gulf in the Sea of Okhotsk, a strait between Alaska and Kodiak Island, a bay on Kruzof Island (near Sitka, Alaska), and a town in Irkutsk Oblast in Russia bear Shelikhov&#x27;s name. Shelekhov travelled via Shelikhov Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk in December 1786-January 1787, after he had been left behind at Bol’shereck in Kamchatka as the winds tore the &quot;Three Hierarchs&quot; from her anchors and carried her out to sea. There is a statue of Shelikhov in his native Rylsk.

== Family ==

His father was Ivan Shelikhov. Ivan had a brother, Andrei, who had at least two children: Semen Andreevich Shelikhov and Sidor Andreevich Shelikhov.

Grigory had two siblings: a sister, Agrofena Ivanova Shelikhova, and a younger brother, Vasilii Ivanovich Shelikhov, who went to Siberia with Grigory to assist with the business.

In 1775 Shelikhov married Natalia Alexeyevna Kozhevina, the daughter of a prominent clan of Okhotsk navigators and mapmakers and their wives. At his death he had five surviving daughters and one son.

Grigory and Natalia had the following children:
*Anna Grigorevna Rezanova, b. 1780
*Ekaterina Grigorevna Timkovskaya, c. 1781
*Avdotia Grigorevna Buldakova, b. 1784
*Aleksandra Grigorevna Politkovskaya, b. 1788
*Natalia Grigorevna Shelikhova, b. 1793
*Katerina Grigorevna Shelikhova
*Vasilii Grigorevich Shelikhov

His 14-year-old daughter Anna married Nikolai Rezanov in January 1795. She died in childbirth seven years later, but had at least one surviving daughter, Olga Nikolaevna Rezanova, who married Kharkiv Governor-General Sergey Aleksandrovich Kokoshkin.

<text>Sherwood Charles Schwartz ( ; November 14, 1916 – July 12, 2011) was an American television screenwriter and producer. He worked on radio shows in the 1940s, but he now is best known for creating the 1960s television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; on CBS and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; on ABC. On March 7, 2008, Schwartz, at the time still active in his 90s, was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That same year, Schwartz was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Schwartz was born in Passaic, New Jersey, to a Jewish family. His parents were Herman and Rose Schwartz. He was a younger brother of writer Al Schwartz. His younger brother, Elroy Schwartz (1923–2013), a comedy writer, became a principal screenwriter for &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and other series. Sherwood Schwartz is the uncle of Douglas Schwartz (who created the &quot;Baywatch&quot; TV series), Bruce Schwartz and Judithe Randall.

==Career==
Schwartz had hoped to become a doctor, but found that he was unable to be admitted to medical school at that time, due to a quota limiting the number of Jewish students.

He went on to write for Ozzie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; and other radio shows. Schwartz served in the United States Army for over four years. While serving, he was a writer on the Armed Forces Radio Network before he got his break in television. From 1956 to 1962, Schwartz was head writer for &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award in 1961. He went on to create and produce &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;. He wrote the theme song for three of his shows: &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (co-wrote), &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.

Syndication turned his two major successes into TV institutions with cultural relevance. He made them icons and as a result became a television icon himself.

==TV appearances==
During the late 1990s and the 2000s, he made many appearances on TV talking about his series, on shows such as the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;TV Land&#x27;s Top Ten&quot; and A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Biography&quot;. He also took part in a &quot;Creators&quot; marathon on Nick at Nite in the late 1990s. He was also a guest at the 2004 TV Land Awards.

In 1988, Schwartz appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Ross Shafer&quot; for a &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reunion, along with all seven castaways from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. This was the last time they were all together on television. He also appeared as himself in a 1995 episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; titled &quot;Sherwood Schwartz, A Loving Tribute&quot;, which also featured the four surviving &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; cast members.

==Personal life==
On December 21, 1941, Sherwood Schwartz married Mildred Seidman, and together they had four children: Donald Schwartz, who became an ophthalmologist; Lloyd J. Schwartz, who worked with his father in show business as a writer and producer in his own right; Ross Schwartz, an attorney and screenwriter whose credits include &quot;Bottle Shock&quot;; and Hope Juber, a writer and producer. His granddaughter is singer-songwriter Ilsey Juber, the daughter of Hope and guitarist Laurence Juber, the former lead guitarist for the band Wings.

Sherwood Schwartz&#x27;s play, &quot;Rockers&quot;, a comedy-drama, had a production at Theatre West in honor of his 90th birthday.

==Death==

On July 12, 2011, Sherwood Schwartz died of natural causes in his sleep.

==Portrayals==
Schwartz was portrayed by Aaron Lustig in the TV movie &quot;Surviving Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and by Michael Tucker in &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot;.

==Filmography==
Schwartz produced a number of radio and TV shows during his career.
==Stage productions==
In 1990, he wrote &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island: The Musical&quot;, still in production as of 2011. His son Lloyd, daughter Hope, and son-in-law Laurence Juber worked on the play as well. 

On November 10, 2006, his play &quot;Rockers&quot; opened in Theatre West in California. The play concerns the lives of three women living in a retirement home. The cast included Pat Crawford Brown, Lee Meriwether, and Elsa Raven.

==Unsold pilots==
He wrote and executive produced two unsold television pilots:

* &quot;Scamps&quot; (1982)—starring Bob Denver, Dreama Denver, and Joey Lawrence
* &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (1983)—starring Alexa Hamilton, Bob Denver, and Harvey Korman

==Awards==
*Won the 1961 Emmy Award for his writing on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;.
*Was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his 2004 special &quot;Still Brady After All These Years&quot;
*On March 7, 2008, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Actresses Dawn Wells and Florence Henderson, who appeared in &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, respectively, accompanied Schwartz when he received his star. Also present was Patrick Denver, son of actor Bob Denver from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, and Christopher Knight and Susan Olsen, the child stars of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.
*Was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2008.

<text>Calamagrostis (reed grass or smallweed) is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae, with about 260 species that occur mainly in temperate regions of the globe. Towards equatorial latitudes, species of &quot;Calamagrostis&quot; generally occur at higher elevations. These tufted perennials usually have hairless narrow leaves. The ligules are usually blunt. The inflorescence forms a panicle. Some may be reed-like.

The plants may be rhizomatous (underground stems with shoots), stoloniferous (with runners), or caespitose (growing in tufts or clumps). The bisexual spikelets have a single floret and generally they are purple or purple-brown. The spikelets are clustered into inflorescences, which usually develop in early- to mid-summer on long culms ( = stems).

Many species of &quot;Calamagrostis&quot; are morphologically similar, but they generally occur in distinct habitats, and they have unique geographical distributions. Given the subtle distinctions between many closely related taxa, there are several species complexes that could benefit from additional systematic study. Even the generic boundaries of the genus are controversial. For example, species in the genus &quot;Deyeuxia&quot;, distributed largely in the southern hemisphere are morphologically very similar to species of &quot;Calamagrostis&quot;. It may be appropriate to recognize all of these species in a single genus, but this will require detailed scientific study of DNA of species from around the world.

Some &quot;Calamagrostis&quot; can be very decorative, and are widely cultivated largely in northern temperate zones. The species &quot;Calamagrostis brachytricha&quot; and the cultivar &quot;Calamagrostis&quot; × &quot;acutiflora&quot; &#x27;Karl Foerster&#x27; are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The word &quot;Calamagrostis&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;kalamos&quot; (reed) and &quot;agrostis&quot; (a kind of grass).

<text>Cobra Commander is a fictional character and the main antagonist of the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; franchise. He is the supreme leader of the terrorist organization [[Cobra (G.I. Joe)|Cobra]] and the archenemy of the G.I. Joe Team. He was portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the film &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, and by Luke Bracey with the voice of Robert Baker in the 2013 sequel &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;.

==Character biography and personality==
Cobra Commander is a fanatical leader who rules with an iron fist and demands total loyalty or allegiance. His objective is total control of the world&#x27;s governments, people, wealth, and resources, brought about by revolution and chaos. He is believed to have personally led uprisings in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and other trouble spots, while being held responsible for kidnapping scientists, businessmen, and military leaders, forcing them to reveal their top level secrets.

Over the years, Cobra Commander has suffered assassination attempts, and even an imposter posing as him for a time. However, he always manages to find a way out of every situation, having become a constant foil for the G.I. Joe Team, who have ended up fighting Cobra almost exclusively. No matter how dire or unscathed, Cobra Commander&#x27;s hatred and drive have only grown ruthless and more focused.

Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander&#x27;s persona runs the gamut from friendly and charismatic, to terrifyingly brutal and psychopathic. His charm can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny, and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures around the world.

==Conception and creation==
The character was created by Marvel Comics writer Larry Hama, who envisioned the character as &quot;being in love with the sound of his own voice&quot;, and drew inspiration from famous conservative pundit William F. Buckley.

==Merchandising==
Cobra Commander was first released as a mail-in figure in 1982. Wearing a light blue uniform and his signature battle helmet, early production runs were marked with an early version of the Cobra sigil, nicknamed the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; emblem for its more rounded shape. All of the original sixteen figures from 1982 were released with &quot;straight arms&quot;. In 1983, the figure with the proper Cobra sigil was released on a card for mass market with &quot;swivel-arm battle grip&quot;, which made it easier for figures to hold their rifles and accessories. In 1984, the Commander was offered again as a mail-away exclusive, this time in a darker blue, with the iconic hood that he wore prominently in the Marvel comics. This figure continued to be available as a mail-away figure until the line ended in 1994.

In 1987, a new Cobra Commander figure was designed, this time outfitting him in full-body battle armor. Cobra Commander was given another overhaul in 1991, wearing a blue and black ceremonial uniform, with an ornate redesign of his original battle helmet. Also in 1991, a &quot;Talking Battle Commander&quot; figure was released, featuring a blue and yellow uniform inspired by the hooded Cobra Commander figure. This figure was repainted in black with silver accents, for 1993&#x27;s Battle Corps subset. A 12&quot; version of the Commander wearing the same uniform (blue with yellow accents) was released in 1993 as well. In 1994, Cobra Commander was suited up for space combat as part of the Star Brigade. Wearing a teal and purple spacesuit, the Commander&#x27;s domed helmet was removable, revealing a masked head underneath. This face is similar to the sculpt which lay under the hood of the 12&quot; figure, with dark hair, and a half mask covering his nose and mouth.

After the line was canceled in 1994, Hasbro made several attempts to resurrect A Real American Hero through repaint series. In 1997, Cobra Commander was released as part of the &quot;Cobra Command Team&quot; 3-pack, using the 1987 Battle Armor mold in a dark blue. In 2000, the Talking Battle Commander mold was repainted (sans talking backpack) in an even darker blue, with silver highlights, with a new character &quot;Chameleon&quot; (a Baroness doppelganger created to sidestep copyright problems). A second repaint of the 1987 figure was made available in 2001, in a muted version of its original color scheme. It was also a double-pack with the &#x27;Laser-Viper&#x27; figure.

===Modern===
In 2002, the Commander was initially meant to be redesigned by Hasbro. After the more radical elements were removed, the Commander emerged as one of the least extreme make-overs of the line, once again sporting the iconic hood. A second Commander figure was released in 2003 for Spy Troops, featuring a more military look than the Commander has ever had before, and using the Commander&#x27;s signature Battle Helmet. Both figures went on to be repainted multiple times in 2004&#x27;s Valor vs. Venom line, including one version with an interchangeable helmet and hood.

A 12&quot; Cobra Commander was released to coincide with the Spy Troops line, based on the same design as its smaller counterpart.

A version of Cobra Commander with no accessories came with the Built to Rule Cobra H.I.S.S. in 2004. The figure featured additional articulation with a mid-thigh cut joint, plus the forearms and calves of the figure sported places where blocks could be attached.

===25th Anniversary===

2007 was the 25th anniversary of the original launch of &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;. To celebrate, Hasbro created three boxed sets of brand new figures, featuring modern sculpt and updated and increased articulation (including the replacement of G.I. Joe&#x27;s trademark O-ring construction). Cobra Commander was included in the inaugural Cobra set, along with Destro, Baroness, Storm Shadow, and a Cobra Trooper. The figure was rereleased on a single card, and repainted in black and gold for the &quot;Cobra Legions&quot; 5-pack, and in comic accurate colors for a Comic 2-Pack. Mirroring the vintage line, Cobra Commander was released with a hooded head sculpt in the first wave of single carded figures.

A second Cobra Commander sculpt, based on the 1987 Battle Armor figure, was released in early 2008. The Battle Helmet version from 2007 was repainted in cartoon accurate colors for a second single card release, and the &quot;Cobra Senior Officers&quot; 3-Pack. The hooded version was repainted for the &quot;Crimson Guard&quot; 3-Pack.

==Comics==

===Marvel Comics (1982–1994)===
Cobra Commander first appeared in the Marvel Comics series &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; #1 (June 1982).

While Cobra Commander&#x27;s birth name and childhood are unknown, he is believed to be a North American citizen born in the mid-twentieth century. His only known relative, an older brother named Dan, enlisted in the military during the Vietnam War, and volunteered for repeated tours to spare his younger sibling from conscription. During this time, the man who would become Cobra Commander worked as a used car salesman. When Dan returned from Vietnam, he displayed deep psychological trauma, and took to self-destructive behavior, resulting in his death in a car collision with another family. Devastated by the loss of his brother, the future Cobra Commander blamed the family&#x27;s survivor: another war veteran, against whom the young Cobra Commander formed an elaborate revenge scheme.

Cobra Commander tracked the former soldier to Japan, where he was training to become a member of the Arashikage ninja clan. The Commander approached the mercenary Firefly to assassinate the soldier, but Firefly referred Cobra Commander to Zartan, another assassin who infiltrated the clan, but ultimately killed the wrong man (the Hard Master). Storm Shadow was blamed for the murder, and his search for his uncle&#x27;s killer would eventually lead him to join Cobra, where he would pledge loyalty to Cobra Commander as his personal bodyguard, in order to get close to him and find the real assassin. The soldier left the ninja clan soon after, to live in seclusion in the Sierra Nevada mountains, until enticed to return to service on the G.I. Joe team as Snake Eyes.

Cobra Commander returned to his wife and newborn son Billy, but when his wife found out what had happened in Japan, she threatened to go to the authorities. Cobra Commander abandoned his wife, taking Billy with him. Living on the road and earning a living by increasingly illicit scams and con jobs, the soon-to-be Commander blamed all his problems on the American social system, and traveled in search of people who shared his desire to topple big business and the government, using money earned from pyramid schemes to attract followers. It was during these early meetings that he first began wearing a blue hood to mask his civilian identity.

He then moved operations to Springfield, an average small American town which had suffered economic collapse. Through his criminal skills he revived Springfield&#x27;s&#x27; fortunes, and used cash and charisma to win converts to his cause. Eventually he seized control of the entire town and used it as a base to grow his organization into the paramilitary group &quot;Cobra&quot;. This corrupting rise to power distanced Cobra Commander from his son, enough that Billy eventually joined the underground anti-Cobra resistance. From Springfield, Cobra&#x27;s agents spread throughout the world, overturning or subverting unstable governments to establish criminal networks and profitable arms trades. The organization also explored dangerous and experimental technology, including mind-scanners and battle robots. Cobra became a significant international threat, becoming so large that Cobra Commander could no longer control it on his own. He created a &quot;High Command&quot; of his most skilled lieutenants, which included Zartan, Baroness Anastasia DeCobray, Scottish arms dealer James McCullen Destro, and Australian mercenary Major Sebastian Bludd.

This led to frequent power-struggles within the organization, and ultimately the Baroness and Major Bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the Commander, and seize control of Cobra. In a twist of fate, the conspirators recruited Billy to carry out the assassination, but he was intercepted by Destro. Cobra Commander had no qualms about torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu. Billy was later caught in the crossfire between the Soft Master and Cobra agent Scrap-Iron, resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed Billy and several others.

During a failed assault on the Pit, the secret headquarters of G.I. Joe, Cobra Commander and Destro were separated from the main Cobra force by an explosion and presumed dead. The two escaped and assumed civilian disguises to travel incognito. Cobra Commander was depicted as an average, physically fit Caucasian with a pony tail, large round green-spectacle sunglasses, and a long slender mustache. Although only a convenient disguise at the time, this civilian look would resurface on subsequent unmaskings. A police officer soon recognized the Commander from a picture carried by an accident victim: the Commander&#x27;s son Billy, who had survived the explosion, but lost a leg and an eye. Unnerved by the discovery, the Commander swore to take responsibility for Billy&#x27;s condition, and promised to be a better father.

Still incognito, the Commander traveled to Denver where he sought out the undercover Crimson Guard agent Fred VII, a mechanical genius. Billy eventually awoke from the coma, with acute amnesia (and a new motorized prosthetic leg built by Fred). After an encounter with the Blind Master and Storm Shadow&#x27;s cousin Jinx, Billy recovered his memory and immediately rejected his father, whereupon the Commander renounced the organization he had founded, declaring that his ambitions had cost him the only things that truly mattered. Fred VII, in return, shot Cobra Commander in the back, apparently killing him.

Fred VII then impersonated the Commander himself, traveling to Cobra Island to vie for control of Cobra with Serpentor (eventually sparking the Cobra Civil War). Unknown to Fred VII, he had been under surveillance by another Crimson Guardsman when he buried the Commander&#x27;s body. This agent discovered that Cobra Commander was not dead, and brought him back to health. Thereafter, the Commander formed an underground network of loyal agents within Cobra, and rebuilt his personal fortune and influence. When Doctor Mindbender went to harvest DNA from Cobra Commander&#x27;s body for the creation of a new leader, he discovered the empty grave, upon which the original Cobra Commander revealed himself and seized open control of Cobra.

Hardened by his &quot;death&quot; and betrayal at the hands of those he once thought loyal, the resurgent Commander was even more ruthless than before. His first act was to eliminate those who tried to murder him or subsequently learned of the act: Fred VII, Raptor, Firefly, Mindbender, Zartan, Billy, and numerous unnamed Cobra personnel, all of whom he had buried alive within a volcano. Later, he established a brainwashing program to compel allegiance from those around him, including Destro, the Baroness, Zartan, Storm Shadow, and Billy. The returned Commander was far more willing to kill, pulling the trigger himself rather than relying on others to kill for him, as when he murdered the Borovian rebels Magda and the White Clown.

As Marvel&#x27;s &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; series drew to a close, Cobra Commander and Snake Eyes finally battled each other in issue #150. Snake Eyes eventually won against an armored Cobra Commander, but the Commander would have the last laugh, as he captured Storm Shadow and successfully brainwashed him back to the allegiance of Cobra. Shortly afterward, Cobra forces in Europe fell to a unified attack by regular military forces. In the wake of this conflict, most of Cobra&#x27;s high command disappeared, and Cobra Commander himself became an international fugitive. Soon after, the military disbanded the G.I. Joe team.

===Devil&#x27;s Due (2001–2008)===
Among the few revisions Devil&#x27;s Due instituted was the expansion of Cobra Commander&#x27;s origin. After his brother&#x27;s death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes to the house of a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships they had both experienced: years before, the judge had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander&#x27;s brother Dan, who ran a veteran&#x27;s hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes&#x27; family. Realizing where his anger had taken him, Snake Eyes refused to kill the man and walked away. Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.

Years after the G.I. Joe Team has disbanded, Kamakura finds evidence that Cobra Commander has returned to the United States. Snake Eyes forwards this information to Duke, who uses it to have the G.I. Joe Team reinstated. Cobra Commander calls together the members of his organization, to let them know about his plan to take over the United States with nano-mites. Destro is the last to arrive, but after hearing the Commander&#x27;s plan, he turns the tables on Cobra Commander, and takes control of Cobra.

Cobra Commander eventually regains control with the help of Storm Shadow, and creates plans to get revenge on both Destro and Hawk. Later, Storm Shadow breaks free of Cobra&#x27;s mind control, and contacts Billy for help. Billy recruits Snake Eyes and Kamakura to assist him in rescuing Storm Shadow, but not before Cobra Commander brainwashes him again. A battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow ends in a stalemate, leaving Storm Shadow in the control of Cobra Commander.

A distress call from T&#x27;Jbang leads the Joes to Tibet, where Cobra Commander and Storm Shadow are hiding with the Red Ninja clan. Snake Eyes defeats their leader Sei Tin, and becomes the new master of the Red Ninja clan. The Joes are then sent on a mission to Cobra Island, where Cobra Commander has returned to power. Meanwhile, Destro is double-crossed by the president of Sierra Gordo, and makes a deal with Duke to deliver Cobra Commander. Destro is traded for Cobra Commander, but not before the Commander shoots Hawk in the back, and in turn is shot from behind by the Baroness. Cobra Commander is freed by the Dreadnoks, and revealed to have been Zartan in disguise.

Cobra Commander takes back complete control of Cobra, and sends a unit to destroy The Pit, as Cobra discovers a weather control weapon named the Tempest, and moves it to their new Monolith Base in Badhikstan. Cobra uses the Tempest to unleash the Deathangel Virus on the county of Badhi, as G.I. Joe attacks Cobra&#x27;s new stronghold. Cobra Commander escapes, but not before shooting Dr. Mindbender, who dies helping G.I. Joe to disable the Tempest. The Red Shadows organization then steps forward, targeting members of both G.I. Joe and Cobra. They are defeated by G.I. Joe, and the team is then deactivated by order of the President, given that Cobra as an organization has fractured, although Cobra Commander remains at large.

====America&#x27;s Elite====
One year after the previous series, satellites begin falling out of orbit and crashing into major cities, resulting in massive civilian casualties. Thinking that Cobra is responsible for the attacks, the G.I. Joe Team is reactivated to deal with the new threat. The team eventually discovers that a man named Vance Wingfield, who once attempted to start a nuclear war and was presumed dead, is behind the attacks. Meanwhile, Cobra Commander, who has been rebuilding his forces since the end of the previous series, infiltrates the U.S. government by disguising himself as White House Chief of Staff Garrett Freelowe. He tries to convince the President to shut down the G.I. Joe team. When he fails, he creates a new team called the Phoenix Guard led by General Philip Rey, a former G.I. Joe commander. The Phoenix Guard infiltrates G.I. Joe headquarters, and manages to capture several Joes, until General Rey discovers the true identities of the Phoenix Guard members. G.I. Joe then captures most of the Phoenix Guard, and after the failed attack on G.I. Joe headquarters, Cobra Commander abandons the White House.

The Baroness then pursues a campaign of revenge against her betrayers, Cobra Commander and Wraith. During her quest, she finds Wraith in a club in Prague, and lures him into a cemetery where she confronts and defeats him, shooting him in the head. She trades his armor to the Red Shadows, in exchange for information on the whereabouts of Cobra Commander. The Baroness locates the Commander in Honduras, but finds that Destro, her husband, is also present. After a brief fight, Destro agrees to trade the M.A.R.S. corporation, his Iron Grenadier forces, and his eldest son Alexander to Cobra Commander, in exchange for his and the Baroness&#x27; baby. Cobra Commander avoids capture, by revealing that he possesses the personal information of every G.I. Joe agent, because of his time working in the White House.

Cobra Commander uses his control of M.A.R.S. weapons to create conflict all over the globe, in a last bid to gain control of the world. G.I. Joe counters by going on the offensive, mobilizing the entire G.I. Joe roster, and launching missions to capture Cobra agents still at large. Meanwhile, Cobra Commander recruits soldier Nick Bailey, making him the last member of a new elite Cobra unit code-named &quot;The Plague&quot;. The main G.I. Joe team heads to Israel, where they help stop an assassination attempt. While the team is away, Cobra Commander attacks Washington, D.C., taking over the White House and capturing the President. Cobra also takes over Fort Meade, while Alexander McCullen attacks London and France with the Iron Grenadiers.

Cobra Commander then sends Tomax and a squad of Night Creepers to &quot;The Coffin&quot;, a prison in Greenland created to hold all of G.I. Joe&#x27;s captured enemies. Tomax manages to free Major Bludd and several others, while killing those Cobra Commander considered &quot;loose ends&quot;. Dela Eden, who had been freed from The Coffin, is recruited by Cobra Commander to find Destro and the Baroness, in order to kill them. Cobra takes over several nuclear arsenals, including one in Suffolk, England. As a warning, Cobra Commander detonates a nuclear bomb in The Empty Quarter, and then broadcasts an ultimatum on television for world leaders to accede to his authority, or he will start choosing populated targets. Billy, Cobra Commander&#x27;s son, confronts his father at Fort Meade and tries to kill him. He fails, and Cobra Commander kills him instead, hanging Billy&#x27;s body from a flagpole, with a message that no one is untouchable.

After the Joes defeat a plan by Cobra Commander to blow up nukes in the Amazon and Antarctica, Cobra Commander and The Plague retreat to a secret base in the Appalachian Mountains, where the first Cobra soldiers were trained. When the Joes attack the Appalachian base, General Colton is shot in the back by Cobra Commander, but survives. The battle ends, when Hawk tackles Cobra Commander, and knocks him out with a punch to the face. In the aftermath, the Joes are still active and fully funded, and Cobra Commander is locked away in a special underwater prison.

Hasbro later announced that all stories published by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing are no longer considered canonical, and are now considered an alternate continuity.

===IDW Publishing (2008–2018)===
In IDW&#x27;s series, &quot;The Commander&quot; is a title and rank, not an individual, and there have been numerous Commanders in the past: they have been elected and placed in power by a ruling body called the Cobra Council.

The first Cobra Commander was a well-known, famous businessman, operating as the Commander in secret. His uniform was a suit and tie, with gloves and variation of the silver face mask. Rather than having an army helmet over the blank face plate mask, the lower portion of the mask has fangs engraved around the jaw line. Unlike other incarnations of the character, this version of Cobra Commander – usually just called &quot;the Commander&quot; – is extremely reclusive, and his existence is only known to only select high-profile Cobra subordinates (such as the twins Tomax and Xamot and the Baroness). Cobra Commander&#x27;s personality is also much more passive-aggressive and introspective; having captured the G.I. Joe spy Chuckles, Cobra Commander refuses to allow Tomax and Xamot to kill the spy, opting instead to personally recruit Chuckles, by taking him into his confidence and promising him revenge against Xamot.

In issue #12 of &quot;G.I. Joe: Cobra&quot;, Xamot attempts to set up Cobra Commander to be killed and Chuckles to be blamed, only to learn the Commander has outmaneuvered him. Chuckles doesn&#x27;t manage to kill the Commander, shooting him and missing. This is the first time a Commander has been killed in action, and a competition erupts in Cobra to find who will be the replacement, directed by the Cobra Council. The competition becomes a contest of who can kill the most Joes: competing Cobra agents include Baroness, Dr. Vargas, Major Bludd, Oda Satori, Tomax, Krake, and Raja Khallikhan. Baroness does not believe the Council would make her the Commander as she&#x27;s a woman – not that this stops her from killing Joes.

Krake wins the competition, largely by revealing that he had killed and replaced one of his rivals with Zartan, doubling his kill score and showing the initiative to break the rules to win. Krake&#x27;s origin would be given in &quot;Cobra Annual 2012&quot;: born in Southeast Asia&#x27;s Golden Triangle during a battle and named Tiger Eyes, he grew up as a child laborer and later child soldier for drug gangs. He was named Krake by Major Bludd, who was impressed when he told Krake he had a spy in his gang and the man responded by killing every other member. Krake was invited to join Cobra, initially resisting but later providing the means to take over several Chinese triads.

The first action Krake takes as Commander is to openly invade the Southeast Asian nation of Nanzhao and steal its gold reserves. During the invasion, he destroys heroin poppy fields, so it initially looks to the world like Cobra is overthrowing a brutal regime and fighting the drug trade; it also drives up the price of heroin, a drug Cobra deals in. The Cobra Council are then slaughtered by Krake&#x27;s agents, giving him full command of Cobra. Writers Chuck Dixon and Mike Costa have said that while the previous Commander allowed his subordinates to &quot;pursue their own goals so long as they kick back to him&quot; and was content to &quot;profit invisibly&quot;, Krake &quot;wants to be known and wants to be powerful, and wants to rule the world in the most supervillainy sense... With his leadership, Cobra shifts from a sneaky, shadowy cabal to an actual military presence.&quot;

&quot;G.I. Joe: Origins&quot; involves a psychotic ex-stock broker, who murders his family and several law enforcement officers when his crimes are discovered. Calling himself &quot;the Chimera&quot; and gathering a militia around him, he is one of the first villains that G.I. Joe faces. It is also noted that he started the sub-prime mortgage crisis of the late 2000s. Larry Hama had intended him to be Cobra Commander, but this idea was dropped with the introduction of the Cobra Council, and has not been seen since &quot;Origins&quot; #5. It has not been specified if he was indeed the Cobra Commander that Chuckles murdered.

===UK continuities===
In the UK &quot;Battle Action Force&quot; comic, Cobra Commander was originally known as Baron Ironblood, leader of the Red Shadows, a ruthless terrorist organization. The Red Shadows were legions of brainwashed fanatic soldiers armed with sophisticated, high-tech weapons. The group was declared the single greatest threat to world security by the UN, with Ironblood being labeled &quot;World Enemy #1&quot;.

In 1985, Hasbro began moves to market G.I. Joe in the UK, under the Action Force name. This would affect the comic version of &quot;Battle Action Force&quot;, as the writers were to get rid of the Red Shadows and Baron Ironblood and replace them with Cobra and Cobra Commander. To preserve continuity within the comic, the decision was made to transform Baron Ironblood in to the Action Force version of Cobra Commander.

The transition came as Baron Ironblood grew tired of his group&#x27;s failures and decided to destroy the Red Shadows, by secretly informing Action Force of the group&#x27;s bases. Going into hiding, Ironblood relocated to Southeast Asia, where he had plastic surgery on his face, constructed a new mask and costumed identity (that of Cobra Commander), and underwent extensive treatment to give him immunity towards all forms of snake venom (a process known as mithridatism). He then began the process of recruiting a new inner circle and organisation, known as Cobra.

Unfortunately for Ironblood, his illicit fortune to finance this new army is stolen by former Red Shadow member, Red Jackal, who he is forced to rebuild as a cyborg (and rechristened as &quot;Destro&quot;). Furthermore, both surviving members of the Red Shadows and the retooled Action Force repeatedly foil his plans. In the final &quot;Battle Action Force&quot; storyline, after an attempt to locate the headquarters of the Action Force team fails and leads to a crushing defeat of his forces, Ironblood/Cobra Commander goes insane and collapses into a near catatonic state.

In &quot;Action Force Weekly&quot;, Cobra Commander is a featured character starting from issue #1, where he is depicted as bald. Destro believes Cobra Commander&#x27;s excesses are the greatest risk to Cobra&#x27;s success.

==Animated series==
===Sunbow===
In the first season of the original 1980s &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; animated series, Cobra Commander is the leader of Cobra, described in the show&#x27;s opening theme as &quot;A ruthless, terrorist organization determined to rule the world&quot;. His face is always covered, either by a featureless chrome mask concealing his entire face or by a hood with eye-hole cutouts. He wears a blue military uniform, occasionally sporting a cape and carrying a scepter, depending on the occasion. His distinctively shrill, raspy voice was provided by Chris Latta. He had a knack for concocting creative schemes for world domination – including cloned dinosaurs, giant amoebas, miniaturized troops stowed away inside Christmas presents, and using a super-laser to gleefully carve a picture of his face on the moon – plans which his immediate subordinates, particularly Destro, often blasted as ridiculous. The writers later commented that they only found Cobra Commander&#x27;s personality when they stopped writing him as an Adolf Hitler-type and started writing him more in the vein of Yosemite Sam.

Season 2 opened with the 5-episode mini-series &quot;Arise, Serpentor, Arise!&quot; in which Doctor Mindbender, disillusioned with Cobra Commander, decides to literally create a new leader to replace him. Acting as an operation to create a super-soldier, Cobra agents are sent around the world to collect DNA samples retrieved from the tombs of history&#x27;s most notorious conquerors and military leaders to genetically craft Cobra Commander&#x27;s successor. Fortunately for the Commander, G.I. Joe interferes with the gene collection to deny the critical inclusion of Sun Tzu&#x27;s DNA, and it is instead replaced with Sgt. Slaughter&#x27;s. During the first attempt to create the ruler, Cobra Commander contaminates the DNA mixture with a mutated virus, causing a rampaging monster. The second attempt is successful due to Scrap-Iron stopping Cobra Commander from sabotaging the experiment again, thus giving birth to Serpentor, who immediately assumes charge of Cobra and deposes the erstwhile Commander to the status of &quot;lackey&quot;. Serpentor soon orders an attack on Washington, D.C., with the Commander in handcuffs. Cobra Commander convinces Dr. Mindbender to free him, as he knows how to use a weapon, and rescues the high command from certain disaster. He saves himself by convincing Serpentor that he truly needs him as a scapegoat.

Thereafter, Cobra Commander seems to be employed as Cobra&#x27;s primary field commander, while Serpentor leads mostly from the Terrordrome. Serpentor even allows Cobra Commander to be the organization&#x27;s second-in-command, a decision tolerated by the rest of the Cobra High Command. Cobra Commander spends much of Season 2 trying to reclaim his former glory from under Serpentor&#x27;s domineering shadow, assembling his own secret society called The Coil to that end.

&quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot; explains Cobra Commander&#x27;s origin in full, while yet contradicting background information previously established in the animated series. Cobra Commander was a scientist and nobleman from the ancient, pre-human society of Cobra-La, now hidden in the Himalayas. Although humanoid in appearance, he has pale blue skin, no hair, and eyes with snake-like pupils. He was disfigured by volatile spores in a laboratory accident, mutating an array of eight additional eyes upon his visage, thus explaining why he wears a mask. Despite this deformity, his ambition was recognized by Cobra-La&#x27;s ruler, Golobulus, and he was chosen to venture from their isolated Himalayan kingdom to establish an army for the razing of human civilization and reemergence of Cobra-La: that army is Cobra. This origin stands in contrast to the episode &quot;Twenty Questions&quot;, where the Commander told an interviewing journalist that he was responsible for spearheading a mutiny at his military academy in his youth. In other episodes, aforementioned reactions to off-screen unmaskings or glimpses of the Commander&#x27;s features are not in keeping with the inhumanly blue-skinned, reptile-man portrayed in the film.

In light of Cobra&#x27;s constant failures, Golobulus decides to put the Commander on trial, via a kangaroo court, and punishes him by forcing his further exposure to the spores; their effect begins to devolve him into a snake. He escapes with Joe member Roadblock, but Cobra Commander&#x27;s &quot;humanity&quot; slips away as his body transforms. He literally loses his human form, ultimately becoming mentally unresponsive and transforming into an oversized snake, as he repeatedly hisses &quot;I was once a man!&quot; During the Joe assault on Cobra-La, he is last seen coming to Lt. Falcon&#x27;s rescue during the final battle and foils Serpentor&#x27;s attack, allowing G.I. Joe to defeat Cobra-La and save the world.

A third season following the events of the movie was planned. In the storyline of Season 3, the Coil would become a criminal organization led by Tomax and Xamot and serve as the Joes&#x27; new enemy. For the first half of the season, Cobra Commander would be a secret character shifting alliances between G.I. Joe and the Coil, in order to destroy them both and rebuild Cobra, and in the second half, reveal himself in mutated form. The season was never produced, as the Sunbow series was abruptly canceled by Hasbro.

===DiC series===
After the movie, as seen in the sequel &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; series, Cobra Commander is still in his snake form and kept as a pet by Serpentor. However, Baroness restores him partly to a semi-human form—through exposure to an ancient primordial energy called Dragonfire, which is the focal point of the first five episodes of the new series. The basic shape of his body is humanoid, his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue. His intellect is fully restored, and upon being outfitted with his battle armor, Cobra Commander once again appears to be a humanoid male. He regains control of Cobra, and even dispatches Serpentor, using the new found Dragonfire energy to temporarily turn him into an oversized iguana. Cobra Commander&#x27;s inhuman origins are never mentioned again, and he is never shown to have reptilian features again. In Season 2, he resumes wearing his original cloth mask, and his eyes and skin appear to be completely human.

Chris Latta returned to voice Cobra Commander for the duration of the DiC series, credited in both seasons as Christopher Collins.

===&quot;Transformers&quot;===

Cobra Commander appeared in the third season of the &quot;Transformers&quot; episode &quot;Only Human&quot;. Set in the then-future year 2006, a trench-coated underground weapons dealer going by the name &quot;Old Snake&quot; is approached by crime lord Victor Drath, who wishes to purchase synthoid technology (as seen in a few episodes of the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated series). Old Snake transfers the minds of Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Arcee and Springer into synthoid bodies, leaving their robotic shells for Drath&#x27;s use in criminal activities.

Although it is never explicitly stated that &quot;Old Snake&quot; is actually an aged Cobra Commander, his raspy voice is again provided by Chris Latta, he wears the character&#x27;s distinctive silver mask, and has visible traces of his blue uniform underneath his trench coat. He is identified in dialogue as the former leader of a terrorist organization that developed synthoid technology. At the end of the episode, Drath and his men are arrested, and Old Snake, being able to evade the authorities, laments about terrorists not being what they once were. He raises his fists skyward and starts to give the rally cry of Cobra, but breaks prematurely into a hacking cough.

This version of Cobra Commander was commemorated with the unlicensed &quot;Snake&quot; toy produced by Headrobots, limited to 300 pieces, and officially in 2015 as part of the G.I. Joe and the Transformers line released by Hasbro through the Transformers Collectors&#x27; Club. According to the profile included with the latter figure, Old Snake further experimented with Transformer technology, and after a failed experiment dubbed Serpent O.R., he revived the Battle Android Trooper program, creating the Advanced Stealth B.A.T., capable of transforming into an unmanned aerial vehicle.

===&quot;Sgt. Savage and the Screaming Eagles&quot;===
Cobra Commander appears briefly in the pilot episode of &quot;Sgt. Savage and his Screaming Eagles&quot;, having a video conference with General Blitz concerning the relationship between Cobra and Blitz&#x27;s I.R.O.N. Army. He wears the uniform of his 1992 action figure, and is voiced by Scott McNeil in this appearance. General Blitz refers to ties between the two groups, and states that he had helped create Cobra. He then threatens to destroy Cobra if Cobra Commander interferes with Blitz&#x27;s mission, but the Commander does not seem intimidated.

===&quot;Spy Troops and Valor vs. Venom&quot;===
Cobra Commander appeared in the direct-to-video CGI animated movies &quot;G.I. Joe: Spy Troops&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe: Valor vs. Venom&quot;, voiced by Michael Dobson. Much like his Sunbow counterpart, Cobra Commander has a squeaky, raspy voice and often has comical moments of snapping at his minions.

He attempts to bolster Cobra&#x27;s forces via androids and mutating civilians; though each attempt backfired due to his impatience and ignoring obvious flaws. By the second film, he is ditched by Cobra while lamenting his loss; allowing the Joes to detain him.

===&quot;G.I. Joe: Resolute&quot;===
In the miniseries, Cobra Commander is portrayed in a darker incarnation than the one in Sigma 6, revealing the attributes of cowardice and hysterics to have been only a mask for weeding out traitors and such among his organization, as well as to motivate his followers to think for themselves. He executes a plan to achieve world dominion through the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program with a prototype particle beam weapon to hold the world hostage. He is portrayed as utterly ruthless, casually destroying all of Moscow just to demonstrate the beam&#x27;s power to the United Nations and killing anyone in his organization who shows incompetence or threatens his command, such as Sebastian Bludd. Over the course of the story, Cobra Commander becomes more unhinged as his scheme unravels and his underlings are killed/captured, choosing to strike cities randomly instead of waiting for the United Nations to respond to his demands. Ordering his troops to defend the Springfield base where he has hidden himself, Cobra Commander slaughters his control team for the particle superweapon and takes shelter in a bunker as Duke arrives to disable the weapon, now aimed at the U.S. capital. As he gloats about his victory, Duke recalibrates the weapon to fire at Springfield instead, and Cobra Commander desperately tries to escape the nigh-indestructible bunker that Duke had forced shut as Springfield is destroyed. Despite this, Cobra Commander was found to be missing from the bunker when Duke made a return to the site. Cobra Commander was voiced by Charlie Adler.

===&quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;===
In the series &quot;G.I. Joe: Renegades&quot;, Cobra Commander is reinterpreted as a corporate businessman known as Adam DeCobray, CEO of the legitimate Cobra Industries, a multinational conglomerate which serves as a front for his terrorist organization, it is also revealed that Adam DeCobray isn&#x27;t his real name. He is egotistical, but nowhere as arrogant and pompous in his promotional speechmaking as some of his other incarnations. Suffering a disfiguring terminal condition that resorts to him wearing a full breathing mask covered by plastic shielding wrap, Cobra Commander is forced to appear to the public as a normal-looking virtual simulation over video screens with only a few like Baroness knowing of his true appearance. Only Doctor Mindbender knows the full truth of his condition as Cobra Commander funds the scientist&#x27;s research in hopes to achieve immortality. Charlie Adler reprises the role of Cobra Commander for this series.

While he is more ruthless and less incompetent than his previous versions, Cobra Commander still has an affinity for big, expensive schemes such as building a transcontinental, maglev train network to move weapons and resources across the country, making armies of Bio-Viper soldiers, and later the M.A.S.S. teleportation device. He doesn&#x27;t participate in field work, carrying out most of his day-to-day activities from a high-tech bunker located under his mansion.

==Sigma 6==
In &quot;G.I. Joe: Sigma 6&quot;, Cobra Commander&#x27;s profile has been modified, stating that he considers himself a warrior king. This rendition of the character possesses snake-like eyes as well as full battle armor. He wears a helmet that resembles a snake&#x27;s head and covers his face with a hood. The snake staff he carries contains a number of hidden weapons systems. In the &quot;Sigma 6&quot; animated series, the Commander was voiced by Marc Thompson. At the series conclusion, most of Cobra has been captured but Cobra Commander and Firefly are still at large.

Sigma 6 figures were heavily stylized with help by the Japanese animation company Gonzo. The Cobra Commander was released in the &quot;Commando&quot; collection in a new 8&quot; scale, in 2006. Wearing body armor and a cape, the Commander still donned his iconic hood with a battle helmet on top of it. As an action figure, Cobra Commander had a spinning wheel built into his chest, which registered battle damage if hit. A repaint of this figure, without the battle-damage feature and new weapons, was released in black and silver. A second, more radical repaint followed in 2007, with the Commander&#x27;s armor painted silver, and an air chariot included as an accessory.

The Commander was also released in the 2.5&quot; line, initially as part of the &quot;B.A.T. Attack&quot; figure 4-pack. A second version was included with the H.I.S.S. Tank.

==Live action films==

Cobra Commander appears in the movie &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Gordon-Levitt wore a mask and prosthetic makeup underneath. Upon seeing concept art of the role he was being offered, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; &quot;I saw the designs and drawings of the way they interpreted my character for this movie – the costume, the whole getup – and I was like, &#x27;Oh, wow. I get to be that guy? Fantastic. Sign me up. Please. Thank you.&#x27;&quot; Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being half reminiscent of Chris Latta&#x27;s voice for the 1980s cartoon, but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous. The hood was not used in the movie, due to concerns that it would resemble the hood used by the KKK.

For most of the movie, he is referred to as The Doctor, a &quot;mad&quot; scientist working with James McCullen researching military uses of nanomites. It is revealed that he was Rexford G. &quot;Rex&quot; Lewis, the younger brother of Ana Lewis, and once a military science officer alongside Duke, his friend and mentor. When an enemy East African location is destroyed prematurely by an air strike, Rex is presumed dead. However, just prior to the explosion, Rex witnessed McCullen&#x27;s experimental research on nanomites, conducted by Doctor Mindbender. Surviving the incident, scarred &amp; requiring a special mask to breathe, Rex learns from Mindbender and perfects the nanomites. He uses his own sister as a test subject in creating the Neo-Vipers, making her the Cobra agent known as the Baroness. Rex holds a grudge against Duke for leaving him to die. When Duke is captured, Rex reveals himself, as he attempts to inject Duke with the nanomites, the Baroness overcomes her programming and saves Duke, while Rex escapes with a badly burned McCullen. Rex uses specially made nanomites to heal McCullen&#x27;s face, which also encases it in a living, silver-like metal. Dubbing him &quot;Destro&quot;, Rex puts on a new breathing mask and tells McCullen to call him Commander. Although he is arrested and placed in a high security prison aboard the USS Flagg, Cobra Commander&#x27;s master plan has only begun, with Zartan disguised as the President of the United States.

Cobra Commander returns in &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;, played by Australian actor Luke Bracey and voiced by Robert Baker. Director Jon Chu suggested in a March 2012 interview that this Cobra Commander is not the same character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in &quot;The Rise of Cobra&quot;, but in May 2012 confirmed that the Cobra Commander of &quot;Retaliation&quot; is indeed still Rex Lewis. He features an altered appearance from the first film, more similar to his helmeted look from the &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot; cartoon.

In the movie, Cobra Commander has been transferred from the FLAGG to another high-security prison in Germany alongside Destro, where he is being force-fed a paralyzing drug whilst floating in a water chamber. He is soon broken out by Storm Shadow and Firefly, but Destro is left behind and Storm Shadow is injured as the base is destroyed. After sending Storm Shadow off to the Himalayas to heal, Cobra Commander retreats to his own base of operations, where he meets with Zartan (still disguised as the President). They reveal Project Zeus, a super weapon, which uses kinetic bombardment and targets several prominent cities. Cobra Commander demonstrates the magnitude of the weapon&#x27;s power in front of the world&#x27;s leaders by destroying London. The Joes are able to stop Cobra Commander before he unleashes the full power of Zeus, but the terrorist leader escapes after the deaths of Zartan and Firefly.

Cobra Commander will be appearing in &quot;G.I. Joe: Ever Vigilant&quot; for a cameo.

Joe figures to set up a battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. As he imagined the characters in his head, he observed the &quot;core of Cobra Command&quot; atop an oak toy chest, high above the thick shag carpet, and &quot;the hooded Cobra Commander, looking like a blue klansman, was loading his black laser pistol and making small talk with Destro&quot;.

<text>David Cummings (sometimes credited as Dave Cummings) is a British musician and scriptwriter. He is best known for writing for British television comedies such as &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, and for being a guitarist in Del Amitri between 1989 and 1995.

He was educated at Collyer’s School and the University of East Anglia, where he earned a degree in English &amp; American Studies. It was while studying at the UEA that he met Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson, who later went on to create &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. At this time, however, Higson was mostly interested in music, and Cummings was a founder member of his band, The Higsons, who gained some cult popularity at the time.

After graduating, Cummings moved to London, where he continued playing guitar, notably in the cult band Bonsai Forest featuring Paul Whitehouse on lead guitar. In 1989 he joined the Scottish group Del Amitri after the departure of their guitarist Mick Slaven, being pictured on the cover of the 1990 album &quot;Waking Hours&quot; even though he joined after the material had already been recorded.

Cummings played on the next two Del Amitri albums, &quot;Change Everything&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Twisted&quot; in 1995, as well as on various tours, including an appearance at Woodstock &#x27;94. However, at the end of their United States tour of 1995, which saw them riding on the crest of a top ten hit there with the song &quot;Roll to Me&quot;, Cummings decided to leave the band. He thought all the touring might put a strain on his marital life, and his departure is documented - and somewhat dramatised - on the band&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek 1996 tour diary video release &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Home&quot;.

Even before his departure from the band, since 1994 Cummings had begun to move into scriptwriting, working with Whitehouse on material for comedian Harry Enfield&#x27;s &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot; sketch show broadcast on BBC One.

His friendship with Whitehouse and Higson led to Del Amitri appearing in an episode of their BBC Two sketch show &quot;The Fast Show&quot; in 1995, and after his departure from the band Cummings turned full-time to television scriptwriting.

As well as continuing to write for &quot;The Fast Show&quot; until its conclusion in 2000, Cummings co-wrote with Whitehouse the sitcom &quot;Happiness&quot; (BBC Two, 2000–01) and the feature film &quot;Kevin and Perry Go Large&quot;, which was a spin-off from &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;.

In 2014, he appeared in &quot;The Life of Rock with Brian Pern&quot; as John, the bassist of the fictional prog rock band Thotch.

In 2015, he helped co-write Paul Whitehouse&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Nurse&quot;, based on his Radio 4 show of the same name, which debuted on BBC 2 on 10 March.

<text>Eduardo Risso (born 23 November 1959) is an Argentine comics artist. In the United States he is best known for his work with writer Brian Azzarello on the Vertigo title &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, while in Argentina and Europe he is noted for his collaborations with Ricardo Barreiro and Carlos Trillo. He has received much acclaim for his work.

He is the main creator of the popular Argentine comic convention Crack Bang Boom; a massive event which is held annually in the city of Rosario and is considered as the most important of its type in South America.

==Biography==
Risso was born in Leones in Córdoba Province, Argentina, and started as a cartoonist in 1981, drawing his first collaborations for the morning newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot; and the magazines &quot;Eroticón&quot; and &quot;Satiricón&quot;, all published by Editorial Columba. In 1986, he worked for Eura Editoriale of Rome, Italy, and in 1987 he drew &quot;Parque Chas&quot;, scripted by Ricardo Barreiro. The series was first published by &quot;Fierro&quot; in Argentina and then by &quot;Totem&quot; in Spain, &quot; Comic Art&quot; in Italy and finally the complete series as an album in France, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. In 1988, he drew &quot;Cain&quot;, again scripted by Barreiro.

Later that same year, Risso drew &quot;Fulù&quot;, scripted by Carlos Trillo, published in Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, and in Argentina in the &quot;Puertitas&quot; magazine. The Trillo-Risso duo also created &quot;Simon: An American Tale&quot;, published in Italy and France, &quot;Borderline&quot;, published in Italy and &quot;Chicanos&quot;, published in Italy and France.

Risso and writer Brian Azzarello launched the &quot;100 Bullets&quot; series for Vertigo in August 1999. Azzarello and Risso collaborated on several Batman stories as well including &quot;Broken City&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #620–625 (December 2003 – May 2004); a Batman serial for &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; #1–12 (2009); and the &quot;Flashpoint: Batman Knight of Vengeance&quot; limited series in 2011. Other projects from the team include &quot;Spaceman&quot; and the &quot;100 Bullets: Brother Lono&quot; limited series. Risso and writer J. Michael Straczynski produced the &quot;Before Watchmen: Moloch&quot; two-issue limited series in 2013. Paul Dini&#x27;s &quot;Dark Night: A True Batman Story&quot; graphic novel was drawn by Risso in 2016. He also started work on the Image Comics series &quot;Moonshine&quot;.

In 2010 he created the Argentine event Crack Bang Boom, a comics/&quot;Argentine comics&quot;, cartoon, cosplay, fantasy and science-fiction convention, which is annually held in the city of Rosario. Hosted and organized by Risso with a group of collaborators and with support from the Municipality of Rosario, Crack Bang Boom has become the most famous convention of its type in Argentina, as well as one of the most important events for the comics world in South America.

==Awards==
Risso has won four Eisner Awards for his work on &quot;100 Bullets&quot; with Brian Azzarello. He won for the &quot;Best Serialized Story&quot; in 2001; for &quot;Best Continuing Series&quot; in 2002 and 2004; and for &quot;Best Artist&quot; in 2002. He won the Harvey Award for &quot;Best Artist&quot; in 2002 and 2003.

<text>Decaffeination is the removal of caffeine from coffee beans, cocoa, tea leaves, and other caffeine-containing materials. Decaffeinated products are commonly termed by the abbreviation decaf. To ensure product quality, manufacturers are required to test the newly decaffeinated coffee beans to make sure that caffeine concentration is relatively low. A caffeine content reduction of at least 97% is required under United States standards. According to a study decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content, but sometimes as much as 20%. 

==Decaffeinated coffee==
Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge performed the first isolation of caffeine from coffee beans in 1820, after the German poet Goethe heard about his work on belladonna extract, and requested he perform an analysis on coffee beans. Though Runge was able to isolate the compound, he did not learn much about the chemistry of caffeine itself, nor did he seek to use the process commercially to produce decaffeinated coffee.

===Processes===
Various methods can be used for decaffeination of coffee. These methods take place prior to roasting and may use organic solvents such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate, supercritical CO2, or water to extract caffeine from the beans, while leaving flavour precursors in as close to their original state as possible.

====Organic solvent====
=====Direct method=====
The first commercially successful decaffeination process was invented by German merchant Ludwig Roselius and co-workers in 1903, after Roselius observed that a consignment of coffee beans accidentally soaked in sea water had lost most of their caffeine content while losing little of their flavour. The process was patented in 1906, and involved steaming coffee beans with various acids or bases, then using benzene as a solvent to remove the caffeine. Coffee decaffeinated this way was sold as Kaffee HAG after the company name &quot;Kaffee Handels-Aktien-Gesellschaft&quot; (Coffee Trading Company) in most of Europe, as &quot;Café Sanka&quot; in France and later as Sanka brand coffee in the United States. Café HAG and Sanka are now worldwide brands of Kraft Foods.

Methods similar to those first developed by Roselius have continued to dominate, and are sometimes known as the &quot;direct organic solvent method&quot;. However, because of health concerns regarding benzene (which is recognized today as a carcinogen), other solvents, such as dichloromethane or ethyl acetate, are now used. The unroasted (green) beans are first steamed and then rinsed with the solvent which extracts the caffeine, while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated between 8 and 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the US standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass per the EU standard).

=====Indirect method=====
Another variation of Roselius&#x27; method is the &quot;indirect organic solvent method&quot;. In this method, instead of treating the beans directly, they are first soaked in hot water for several hours, then removed. The remaining water is treated with solvents (e.g. dichloromethane or ethyl acetate) to extract the caffeine from the water. As in other methods, the caffeine can then be separated from the organic solvent by simple evaporation. The same water is recycled through this two-step process with new batches of beans. An equilibrium is reached after several cycles, wherein the water and the beans have a similar composition except for the caffeine. After this point, the caffeine is the only material removed from the beans, so no coffee strength or other flavorings are lost. Because water is used in the initial phase of this process, indirect method decaffeination is sometimes referred to as &quot;water-processed&quot;. This method was first mentioned in 1941, and people have made significant efforts to make the process more &quot;natural&quot; and a true water-based process by finding ways to process the caffeine out of the water in ways that circumvent the use of organic solvents.

====Swiss Water====

An alternative method for removal of caffeine from coffee is the Swiss Water process. This process uses no organic solvents, and instead only water is used to decaffeinate beans. It is a technique first developed in Switzerland in 1933, and commercialized by Coffex S.A. in 1980. The Swiss Water process was then introduced by The Swiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee Company of Burnaby, British Columbia, in 1988.

The process uses green coffee extract (GCE) for the caffeine extraction mechanism. Green coffee extract is a solution containing the water-soluble components of green coffee except for the caffeine, obtained by soaking green coffee beans in hot water, then filtering through an activated charcoal filter to remove the caffeine molecules. Fresh beans containing both caffeine and the other components are added to the GCE solution, where the gradient pressure difference between the GCE (which is caffeine-lean) and the green coffee (which is caffeine-rich) causes the caffeine molecules to migrate from the green coffee into the GCE. Because GCE is saturated with the other water-soluble components of green coffee, only the caffeine molecules migrate to the GCE; the other water-soluble coffee elements are retained in the green coffee. The newly caffeine-rich GCE solution is then passed through the activated carbon filters to remove the caffeine again, and the process is repeated. The continuous batch process takes 8–10 hours to meet the final residual decaffeinated target.

Food engineer Torunn Atteraas Garin also developed a process to remove caffeine from coffee.

====Triglyceride====
In this process, green coffee beans are soaked in a hot water and coffee solution to draw the caffeine to the surface of the beans. Next, the beans are transferred to another container and immersed in coffee oils that were obtained from spent coffee grounds and left to soak.

After several hours of high temperatures, the triglycerides in the oils remove the caffeine, but not the flavor elements, from the beans. The beans are separated from the oils and dried. The caffeine is removed from the oils, which are reused to decaffeinate another batch of beans. This is a direct-contact method of decaffeination.

====Supercritical CO2====
Food scientists have also turned to supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as a means of decaffeination. Developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Planck Institute, it uses CO2 (carbon dioxide), heated and pressurised above its critical point, to extract caffeine. Green coffee beans are steamed and then added to a high pressure vessel. A mixture of water and CO2 is circulated through the vessel at 300 atm and . At this pressure and temperature CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties midway between a gas and a liquid. Caffeine dissolves into the CO2; but compounds contributing to the flavour of the brewed coffee are largely insoluble in CO2 and remain in the bean. In a separate vessel, caffeine is scrubbed from the CO2 with additional water. The CO2 is then recirculated to the pressure vessel.

===Caffeine content of coffee===
===Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee===
To ensure product quality, manufacturers are required to test the newly decaffeinated coffee beans to make sure that caffeine concentration is relatively low. A caffeine content reduction of at least 97% is required under United States standards. There is less than 0.1% caffeine in decaffeinated coffee and less than 0.3% in decaffeinated instant coffee in Canada. Many coffee companies use high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure how much caffeine remains in the coffee beans. However, since HPLC can be quite costly, some coffee companies are beginning to use other methods such as near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Although HPLC is highly accurate, NIR spectroscopy is much faster, cheaper and overall easier to use. Lastly, another method typically used to measure the remaining caffeine includes ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy: useful for decaffeination processes that include supercritical CO2, as CO2 does not absorb in the UV-Vis range.

A controlled study in 2006 at Florida State University of ten samples of prepared decaffeinated coffee from coffee shops showed that some caffeine remained. Fourteen to twenty cups of such decaffeinated coffee would contain as much caffeine as one cup of regular coffee. The 473 ml (16 ounce) cups of coffee samples contained caffeine in the range of 8.6 mg to 13.9 mg. In another study of popular brands of decaf coffees, the caffeine content varied from 3 mg to 32 mg. In contrast, a 237 ml (8 ounce) cup of regular coffee contains 95–200 mg of caffeine, and a 355 ml (12 ounce) serving of Coca-Cola contains 36 mg.

==Decaffito==
As of 2009, progress toward growing coffee beans that do not contain caffeine was still continuing. The term &quot;Decaffito&quot; has been coined to describe this type of coffee, and trademarked in Brazil.

The prospect for Decaffito-type coffees was shown by the discovery of the naturally caffeine-free &quot;Coffea charrieriana&quot; variety, reported in 2004. It has a deficient caffeine synthase gene, leading it to accumulate theobromine instead of converting it to caffeine. Either this trait could be bred into other coffee plants by crossing them with &quot;C. charrieriana&quot;, or an equivalent effect could be achieved by knocking out the gene for caffeine synthase in normal coffee plants.

==Decaffeinated tea==

Tea may also be decaffeinated, usually by using processes analogous to the direct method or the CO2 process, as described above. Oxidizing tea leaves to create black tea (&quot;red&quot; in Chinese tea culture) or oolong tea leaves from green leaves does not affect the amount of caffeine in the tea, though tea-plant subspecies (i.e. &quot;Camellia sinensis sinensis&quot; vs. &quot;Camellia sinensis assamica&quot;) may differ in natural caffeine content. Younger leaves and buds contain more caffeine by weight than older leaves and stems. Although the CO2 process is favorable because it is convenient, nonexplosive, and nontoxic, a comparison between regular and decaffeinated green teas using supercritical carbon dioxide showed that most volatile, nonpolar compounds (such as linalool and phenylacetaldehyde), green and floral flavor compounds (such as hexanal and (&quot;E&quot;)-2-hexenal), and some unknown compounds disappeared or decreased after decaffeination.

In addition to CO2 process extraction, tea may be also decaffeinated using a hot water treatment. Optimal conditions are met by controlling water temperature, extraction time, and ratio of leaf to water. Temperatures of 100 °C or more, moderate extraction time of 3 minutes, and a 1:20 leaf to water weight per volume ratio removed 83% caffeine content and preserved 95% of total catechins. Catechins, a type of flavanol, contribute to the flavor of the tea and have been shown to increase the suppression of mutagens that may lead to cancer.

Both coffee and tea have tannins, which are responsible for their astringent taste, but tea has around one third of the tannin content of coffee. Thus, decaffeination of tea requires more care to maintain tannin content than decaffeination of coffee in order to preserve this flavor. Preserving tannins is desirable not only because of their flavor, but also because they have been shown to have anticarcinogenic, antimutagenic, antioxidative, and antimicrobial properties. Specifically, tannins accelerate blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease the serum lipid level, and modulate immunoresponses.

Certain processes during normal production might help to decrease the caffeine content directly, or simply lower the rate at which it is released throughout each infusion. In China, this is evident in many cooked pu-erh teas, as well as more heavily fired Wuyi Mountain oolongs; commonly referred to as &#x27;zhonghuo&#x27; (mid-fired) or &#x27;zuhuo&#x27; (high-fired).

A generally accepted statistic is that a cup of normal black (or red) tea contains 40–50 mg of caffeine, roughly half the content of a cup of coffee.

Although a common technique of discarding a short (30 to 60 seconds) steep is believed to much reduce caffeine content of a subsequent brew at the cost of some loss of flavor, research suggests that a five-minute steep yields up to 70% of the caffeine, and a second steep has one-third the caffeine of the first (about 23% of the total caffeine in the leaves).

<text>Alexander Mikhaylovich Butlerov (; 15 September 1828 – 17 August 1886) was a Russian chemist, one of the principal creators of the theory of chemical structure (1857–1861), the first to incorporate double bonds into structural formulas, the discoverer of hexamine (1859), the discoverer of formaldehyde (1859) and the discoverer of the formose reaction (1861). He first proposed the idea of possible tetrahedral arrangement of valence bonds in carbon compounds in 1862.

The crater Butlerov on the Moon is named after him. In 1956 the Academy of Sciences of the USSR established the A. M. Butlerov Prize.

== Biography ==
Butlerov was born into a landowning family. In 1849 he graduated from the Imperial Kazan University. after which he worked there as a teacher. From 1860 to 1863 he was the rector. From 1868 to 1885 he was a professor of Chemistry at the Imperial St. Petersburg University. Butlerov was the chairman of the Chemistry Department of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society from 1878 to 1882.

<text>Aelius Theon (, &quot;gen&quot;.: Θέωνος) was an Alexandrian sophist and author of a collection of preliminary exercises (&quot;progymnasmata&quot;) for the training of orators.
He probably lived and wrote in the mid to late 1st century AD and his treatise is the earliest treatment of these exercises.

The work (extant, though incomplete), which probably formed an appendix to a manual of rhetoric, shows learning and taste, and contains valuable notices on the style and speeches of the masters of Attic oratory.
Theon also wrote commentaries on Xenophon, Isocrates and Demosthenes, and treatises on style. He is to be distinguished from the Stoic Theon, who lived in the time of Augustus and also wrote on rhetoric.

<doc id="861049" wikidata="Q849595" url="?curid=861049" title="Brian Azzarello">
<text>Brian Azzarello (born August 11, 1962) is an American comic book writer and screenwriter who first came to prominence with the hardboiled crime series &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, published by DC Comics&#x27; mature-audience imprint Vertigo. Azzarello is best known for his numerous collaborations with artists Eduardo Risso (&quot;100 Bullets&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Spaceman&quot;, &quot;Moonshine&quot;) and Lee Bermejo (&quot;Batman/Deathblow&quot;, &quot;Luthor&quot;, &quot;Joker&quot;, &quot;&quot;), his contributions to the &quot;Watchmen&quot; prequel project &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; sequel series &quot;DK III: The Master Race&quot;, as well as for his stints on the long-running Vertigo series &quot;Hellblazer&quot; and The New 52 relaunch of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; title.

==Early life==
Azzarello grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where his mother managed a restaurant and his father was a salesman. As a child, he read monster and war comic books, but avoided the superhero genre. He attended the Cleveland Institute of Art, studying painting and printmaking. In 1989, after several years of working various blue-collar jobs, Azzarello moved to Chicago, where he became interested in the work of Black Lizard Press, a small publishing house which reprinted hardboiled detective and noir fiction. He also met his future wife Jill Thompson, a comic book artist who was working for DC Comics&#x27;s imprint Vertigo.

==Career==
Azzarello began working in comics in 1992, joining as the production coordinator. He was soon promoted to managing editor, before becoming Editor-in-Chief—or, as he was often credited, &quot;line editor&quot;—the position he held from 1993 until the company&#x27;s demise in 1997. During this period, Azzarello&#x27;s wife Jill Thompson introduced him to Lou Stathis, an editor at DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo who wanted to move away from the light fantasy stories the imprint was known for at the time, and Azzarello was eventually hired as a writer. He contributed short stories to a number of Vertigo&#x27;s anthology titles and penned &quot;Jonny Double&quot;, a 4-issue limited series which marked his first collaboration with Argentine artist Eduardo Risso. In August 1999, Azzarello and Risso launched &quot;100 Bullets&quot;, a hardboiled noir series for Vertigo. The series ran for one hundred issues, from 1999 to 2009, and was noted for Azzarello&#x27;s use of regional and local accents, as well as the frequent use of slang and oblique, metaphorical language in his characters&#x27; dialogue. Azzarello&#x27;s other work for Vertigo includes a run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, the 2005 western series &quot;Loveless&quot; with artist Marcelo Frusin and an original graphic novel &quot;Filthy Rich&quot;, one of the two titles that launched the Vertigo Crime line in 2009.

In 2003, Azzarello was assigned to write arcs for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;, commenting to &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;DC is giving me the keys to both cars in the garage, the Maserati and the Ferrari... Somebody told me, &#x27;Don&#x27;t drive drunk.&#x27;&quot; The results were the 6-issue &quot;&quot; and the 12-issue &quot;Superman: For Tomorrow&quot;, which was supposed to be the centerpiece of a larger storyline consisting of several interconnected mini-series, including one written by Azzarello, &quot;Lex Luthor: Man of Steel&quot;. The initiative, unofficially dubbed &quot;Superstorm&quot; due to the fact that the mini-series were edited by the team of DC&#x27;s Wildstorm imprint, experienced production problems and delays, causing &quot;Luthor&quot; to become a standalone work only loosely connected to &quot;For Tomorrow&quot;. In the following years, Azzarello continued to write more Batman-related stories such as the 2008 graphic novel &quot;Joker&quot;, a serial for &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Flashpoint: Batman — Knight of Vengeance&quot;. In April 2015, Azzarello was announced as the co-writer of an eight-issue sequel to &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;, titled &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot;, with Frank Miller and artist Andy Kubert. The series, released bi-monthly, was launched in late 2015. Azzarello&#x27;s most recent Batman work was the &quot;&quot; three-issue series for the DC Black Label imprint with artist Lee Bermejo.

Azzarello was one of the architects of First Wave, a new publishing line for pulp characters then-recently acquired by DC Comics, set outside the main DC continuity. He wrote the opening one-shot for the line, &quot;Batman/Doc Savage&quot;, continuing with the &quot;First Wave&quot; limited series. In 2011, Azzarello spearheaded The New 52 relaunch of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series with artist Cliff Chiang. The pair stayed on the title until issue #35 (Dec. 2014). In 2012, Azzarello wrote two limited series for the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; project, focusing on Comedian and Rorschach. In 2014, Azzarello became the co-writer of the weekly series &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot; along with Jeff Lemire, Keith Giffen and Dan Jurgens.

In 2016, Azzarello launched the 12-issue maxi-series &quot;Moonshine&quot; with frequent collaborator Eduardo Risso at Image. In 2019, the series resumed publication with issue #13 as an ongoing title. The series lasted for 28 issues, ending in 2021.

==Awards==
Azzarello and Risso won the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story in &quot;100 Bullets&quot; #15–18: &quot;Hang Up on the Hang Low&quot;.

==Influences==
Azzarello cites Jim Thompson and David Goodis among his influences.

==Personal life==

Azzarello was married to fellow comic book creator Jill Thompson. The couple resided in Chicago. In a 2021 interview with Word Balloon Podcast Network, Azzarello mentioned that he was no longer married to Thompson. 

The character &quot;666&quot; from Mark Waid and Alex Ross&#x27; 1996 mini-series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; is physically modeled after Azzarello.

<text>The Adam A500 is an American six-seat civil utility aircraft that was produced by Adam Aircraft Industries. The aircraft is of pod-and-boom, push-pull configuration with its two Continental TSIO-550-E piston engines mounted to provide centerline thrust.

==Design and development==

The A500 was developed from the M-309 CarbonAero technology demonstrator designed by Burt Rutan and built by Scaled Composites at the Mojave Airport. The &quot;309&quot; designation refers to this being Rutan&#x27;s 309th aircraft design. 
The 309 first flew in March 2000, but the aircraft has since been gutted and was used as a static display outside the Adam Aircraft Industries headquarters. In 2006 the 309 was loaned to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum and is now on display.

Compared to conventional twin-engine installations, the centerline thrust arrangement reduces drag and maximizes the controllability of the aircraft should one engine malfunction or fail. This engine configuration was used by the similar Cessna Skymaster. The A500 airframe is largely built of carbon fiber epoxy composite materials with a Nomex honeycomb core. Other features include cabin pressurization.

The prototype A500 first flew on July 11, 2002, and was FAA certified in May 2005.

Adam Aircraft ceased operations on 11 February 2008, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on 19 February 2008, having delivered seven A500s.

In April 2008 Adam Aircraft was purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc. At the time of purchase this new company indicated that they would pursue certification of the A700 jet as a priority and that the A500 would not be produced due to the continuing poor market for piston-engined aircraft. AAI went out of business in April 2009 without producing any aircraft.

In July 2009 there was an indication that a new buyer, Thomas Hsueh of Triton America based at Skagit Regional Airport in Burlington, Washington, was interested in purchasing the A500 design and returning the aircraft to production.

In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they had acquired the assets of Adam Aircraft including the aircraft type certificate and intend to return the A500 to production.

In April 2011 Triton Aerospace announced that they will redesign the aircraft using what Thomas Hsueh, owner of Triton Aerospace, termed &quot;proper engineering&quot; to shed of empty weight and recertify it with the intention of putting it back into production. The aircraft will also be changed to a turboprop, with twin engined and rear-engined-only versions. A new prototype was expected in 2013 with re-certification to follow. Hsueh indicated that for now production is planned for the US, but costs may require moving the assembly line to China or even a lower cost country such as Mexico.

By 2013 the Triton website had been taken down and the URL sold. It is likely that the company has gone out of business.

===A500 payload issues===
In evaluation flights conducted in 2007 the A500 was noted as being over the projected empty weight by or 30%.

The initial design empty weight publicized in 2003 was , while the actual empty weight of the serial number 7 A500 was . Initial gross weight was to be , which was increased to . This resulted in a change of useful load from a forecast .

With the fuel tanks full, the available payload for crew, passengers and baggage is , down from a projected . This means that the A500 cannot carry full fuel and one standard weight adult male or female pilot.

Adam Aircraft had intended to address the lack of useful load by demonstrating that the current of unusable fuel is actually . This would have increased the useful load by and allowed a full fuel crew weight of .

===Support and aircraft type club formation===
The five A500s in private service have run into problems obtaining parts and at least one was reported as grounded due to parts issues in August 2008.

The aircraft owners organized an aircraft type club, the &quot;A500 Owners Association&quot;, with the goal of convincing the new owners of the design at that time, AAI Acquisitions to provide parts support for the existing aircraft.

AAI&#x27;s head of customer support, Jan D&#x27;Angelo, responded in August 2008, saying:

<text>John Edward Poynder Grigg (15 April 1924 – 31 December 2001) was a British writer, historian and politician. He was the 2nd Baron Altrincham from 1955 until he disclaimed that title under the Peerage Act on the day it received Royal Assent in 1963.

Grigg edited the &quot;National and English Review&quot; (1954–1960) as his father had done. He was a liberal Tory but was defeated at the 1951 and 1955 general elections. In an article for the &quot;National and English Review&quot; in August 1957, Grigg argued that Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s court was too upper-class and British, and instead advocated a more &quot;classless&quot; and Commonwealth court. He also likened the Queen&#x27;s voice to that of &quot;a priggish schoolgirl&quot;. He was slapped across the face by a man in public, and was attacked by the majority of the press, with a minority, including the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and Ian Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;The Spectator&quot;, agreeing with some of Grigg&#x27;s ideas.

As a historian, his most notable work was an uncompleted four-volume biography of Prime Minister David Lloyd George; he had reached the end of the First World War in 1918 by the time of his death.

==Early years==
Born in Westminster, Grigg was the son of Edward Grigg, 1st Baron Altrincham and his wife, Joan, daughter of politician John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington. Edward Grigg was a &quot;Times&quot; journalist, Liberal, and later Conservative, MP, Governor of Kenya, and member of Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime government. His mother organised nursing and midwifery in Kenya.

From Eton, Grigg joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into his father&#x27;s regiment, the Grenadier Guards, in 1943 during the Second World War (1939–1945). While in the British Army, Grigg served as an officer of the Guard at St James&#x27;s Palace and Windsor Castle, Berkshire, and saw action as a platoon commander in the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards, part of the 5th Guards Armoured Brigade of the Guards Armoured Division, against the German Army in France and Belgium. Towards the end of the war, he became an intelligence officer.

After the war, Grigg read Modern History at New College, Oxford. While at Oxford University, he gained a reputation for academic excellence, winning the University Gladstone Memorial Prize in 1948. In the same year, after graduating with second-class honours, Grigg joined the &quot;National Review&quot;, which was owned and edited by his father.

==Political career==
A liberal Tory, and later a supporter of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, Grigg sought election to the House of Commons. He stood for election for the recently created Oldham West at the 1951 general election, but was defeated by the sitting member Leslie Hale. Grigg contested the seat again in the 1955 general election but was similarly unsuccessful. With his father&#x27;s death in December 1955, Grigg inherited the title of Baron Altrincham, which seemingly ended any hope of his being able to stand again as a candidate. Nonetheless, Grigg refused to apply for a writ of summons to exercise his right to a seat in the House of Lords.

When Tony Benn (the Viscount Stansgate) succeeded in obtaining passage of the Peerage Act, Grigg was the second person (after Benn himself) to take advantage of the new law and disclaim his peerage. In 1997, he wrote that he was &quot;entirely opposed to hereditary seats in Parliament&quot; and added that at that time in 1963 he &quot;felt honour-bound to disclaim, though it was a bore to have to change my name again&quot;. Grigg never achieved his ambition of election to the House of Commons. In 1963, he was publicly rejected by the Conservatives and passed over for being chosen as Tory candidate for Morecambe and Lonsdale. In the 1990s Grigg told Ben Pimlott that this was because of his views on the Royal Family being viewed with disdain by the Tories. Grigg left the Conservative Party for the SDP in 1982.

== Journalism ==
As his father&#x27;s health failed during the first few years of the 1950s, Grigg assumed most of the managerial and editorial duties of the renamed &quot;National and English Review&quot;. By the time of his father&#x27;s death in December 1955, Grigg had taken over the editorship formally, and began to edit the &quot;Review&quot; into a publication more reflective of his views.

In 1956, Grigg attacked Anthony Eden&#x27;s Conservative government for its handling of the Suez Crisis, and pressed for an immediate withdrawal of British forces from Port Said. He followed his father in championing reform of the House of Lords, although he added that, in lieu of reform, abolition might be the only alternative. He also advocated the introduction of women priests into the Anglican Church.

=== &quot;The Monarchy Today&quot; ===
Grigg was a committed monarchist. When talking to the journalist Robert Lacey about his public criticisms of the Royal Family, Grigg defended himself against the idea that he was an anti-monarchist: &quot;That is like saying that an art critic is anti-art. I love the monarchy. Constitutional monarchy is Britain&#x27;s greatest invention.&quot;

In an August 1957 article, &quot;The Monarchy Today&quot;, Grigg argued his opinions on the young Queen Elizabeth II and her Court. Of the Royal Family, he said: &quot;They have to perform the seemingly impossible task of being at once ordinary and extraordinary&quot;:

Grigg was critical of the Debutantes&#x27; Parties: &quot;... a grotesque survival from the Monarchy&#x27;s &#x27;hierarchical&#x27; past&quot;: &quot;These Parties should certainly have been quietly discontinued in 1945. They pander to snobbishness and give the Queen the appearance of standing at the apex of an aristocratic and plutocratic pyramid. People have a right to &#x27;bring out&#x27; their daughters in whatever way they please, but the Crown&#x27;s benison should be reserved for those who have qualified for it by public service.&quot;

Continuing on with the theme of aristocracy, he wrote: &quot;The present composition of the Court emphasizes the social lopsidedness to which the Monarchy is still prone. The Queen&#x27;s entourage – those who serve her from day to day, who accompany her when she travels and sit with her when she eats – are almost without exception people of the &#x27;tweedy&#x27; sort. Such people may be shrewd, broad-minded and thoroughly suitable for positions at Court, but the same is true of many who are not &#x27;tweedy&#x27;; and the fact that the Queen&#x27;s personal staff represents almost exclusively a single social type creates an unfortunate impression... The Queen should surely now be surrounded by advisers and companions with as many different backgrounds as possible. A truly classless and Commonwealth Court would not only bear eloquent witness to the transformed nature of the Monarchy, but would also give the Queen and her Family the advantage of daily contact with an interesting variety of personalities and points of view.&quot;

Grigg was critical of the Queen&#x27;s style of public speaking, describing it as &quot;frankly &#x27;a pain in the neck:

==== Reaction and controversy ====
Grigg&#x27;s article was featured in the national press, and caused an international furore in which he was criticised by, amongst others, Geoffrey Fisher, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Within the first two days of the controversy that followed its publication, Grigg was invited to discuss his article with Martin Charteris, the Queen&#x27;s assistant private secretary. During a political meeting at Eton thirty years later, Charteris publicly thanked Grigg for his work: &quot;You did a great service to the monarchy and I&#x27;m glad to say so publicly.&quot;

At the time in 1957, as Lord Altrincham, Grigg was denounced by Altrincham Town Council for his views. A statement issued by the Council on 6 August stated: &quot;We the elected representatives of the ratepayers of this Ancient Town of Altrincham present at this informal meeting most strongly deplore the article written by Lord Altrincham and wish to completely disassociate this borough from the comments and statements contained in that article. At the same time we desire that it should be known by her Majesty the Queen that no town has a greater sense of loyalty and devotion to the Crown than the borough of Altrincham.&quot;

At the start of the controversy, Grigg was invited by Granada Television to be interviewed on their news programme &quot;Impact&quot;. The interview took place on the evening of 6 August 1957, and was conducted by Robin Day. Grigg defended his article in front of Day, stating that he did not wish to apologise or retract what he had written, but saying that he did regret that anyone should have thought he was hostile to the Queen. He said that his aim had been to bring about a change in the atmosphere which surrounded the Queen and the Monarchy across the whole country.

After the interview, Grigg left Television House in the company of Ludovic Kennedy. As the two of them came out onto the street, Philip Kinghorn Burbidge, a member of the far-right, extreme-nationalist League of Empire Loyalists, came up to them and slapped Grigg&#x27;s face, saying: &quot;Take that from the League of Empire Loyalists.&quot; Burbidge, who was 64 years old, was taken away by the police. Grigg said of the incident: &quot;There was no strength behind the blow. I have not had to have any attention. There were quite a lot of bystanders who saw this happen. They all seemed tremendously friendly towards me.&quot;

Burbidge later pleaded guilty to a charge of using insulting behaviour. He was fined 20 shillings. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Sir Laurence Dunne, said of him: &quot;I suppose 96 per cent of the population of this country were disgusted and offended by what was written, but I suppose that 99.9 per cent recurring of these would hesitate to select you as their champion. Your action only made a most unsavoury episode more squalid. In a case like this the weapon to be used is the weight of public opinion and not to make it the excuse for a gutter brawl.&quot;

Burbidge himself said: &quot;Such actions are foreign to my nature. Due to the scurrilous attack by Lord Altrincham I felt it was up to a decent Briton to show resentment. What I feared most was the overseas repercussions and publication in American newspapers. I thought our fortunes were at a low ebb and such things only made them more deplorable.&quot;

Grigg was interviewed by Pathé News. Describing why he had written his article, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a journalist. I&#x27;m a subject of the Queen. I care very much for her future and I want her reign to be as successful as it possibly can be.&quot; Asked if he was at all repentant of his criticisms, he said, &quot;No I can&#x27;t say I am. I mean, everything controversial provokes criticism. But I&#x27;m quite sure that this needed saying, and from the letters that I&#x27;m getting in enormous numbers, I am convinced that a majority of the people in this country, and in other countries of the Commonwealth, are on my side in this matter. The letters at the moment are running 3 to 1 in my favour. But even if they weren&#x27;t, I still would not be repentant, because I am sure what I said was true, and needed saying.&quot; On the Royal Court and the Queen&#x27;s speeches, he said, &quot;Well very briefly, the trouble about the Court is that it&#x27;s all drawn from one small section of this country. It should be drawn from every country of the Commonwealth, and from every section of the community. That&#x27;s what I feel about the Court. About the Queen&#x27;s speeches, I feel her own natural self is not allowed to come through. It&#x27;s a sort of synthetic creature that speaks. Not the Queen as she really is. And if she herself was allowed to speak, the effect would be wonderful.&quot;

Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia, was publicly critical of Grigg, describing his article as &quot;shocking criticism&quot;: &quot;It is a pity that it should have been lifted out of a journal with not a very great circulation and given an audience of many millions in the world Press. I think the Queen performs her duties in the Royal office with perfection, with great poise, great character, and great intelligence. If it is now to be said that she reads a speech I might say that many of the great statesmen of the world will have to face the same charge and had better be criticised for it.&quot;

Grigg responded to Menzies&#x27; criticism in a front page interview with the &quot;Melbourne Herald&quot;. &quot;He is stuffily subservient... typical of the worst attitude towards the Crown... he puts the Queen on a pedestal and genuflects. He simply blindly worships the Sovereign as someone above criticism. Far from doing the Queen service he is doing her a disservice. I regard his attitude as disgusting, and if it were accepted by most of the Queen&#x27;s subjects – ordinary people like you and me – the monarchy would be in grave danger. Please don&#x27;t think I haven&#x27;t great respect for Mr. Menzies. In the sort of Commonwealth court I visualize I would like to see men of Mr. Menzies&#x27; brilliance around the Queen, but not men of his particular view – by that, I don&#x27;t mean his political view, but his approach towards the Monarchy.&quot;

Grigg also commented on the advice Menzies had given to the Queen during her 1954 tour of Western Australia. He said there had been a mild outbreak of poliomyelitis at the time. Although the risk of the Queen catching polio was minute, especially when compared to that for the thousands of people who crowded into the streets to see her, as a result of Menzies&#x27; advice, the Queen did not shake hands with anyone during her entire visit there. Of the Queen, Grigg said: &quot;I feel that if the situation was put to her properly she would have seen that it wasn&#x27;t the way a Sovereign acts.&quot;

Grigg took part in another Granada broadcast, &quot;Youth Wants To Know&quot;, this time from Granada Studios in Manchester. He stood by his criticism of the Queen spending a whole week watching racing at Goodwood: &quot;She takes quite a lot of holidays as it is... If this were pointed out to her, I&#x27;m sure she would be the first to see it.&quot; Grigg also stated his belief that &quot;the reason that our monarchy is so strong is that it is subject to comment and criticism.&quot; He said that he had not foreseen his article gaining &quot;such very large publicity&quot; and declared: &quot;One can be clumsy and nevertheless have convictions.&quot;

Looking back, Grigg was critical of 1950s royal coverage, citing what he called its &quot;blandness and servility&quot;: &quot;I was rather worried by the general tone of comment, or the absence of comment really in regards to the monarchy – the way we were sort of drifting into a kind of Japanese Shintoism, at least it seemed to me, in which the monarchy was not so much loved as it should be and cherished, but worshipped in a kind of quasi-religious way. And criticism of the people who were actually embodying it at the time was completely out.&quot;

=== After 1960 ===
The &quot;National and English Review&quot; closed in June 1960, with its 928th and last issue. At the same time, Grigg started working at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which had just relocated to London from its original home in Manchester. For the rest of the decade he wrote a column, entitled &quot;A Word in Edgeways&quot;, which he shared with Tony Benn.

==Work as a biographer and historian==
At that same time, in the late 1960s, Grigg turned his attention to the project that would occupy him for the remainder of his life: a multi-volume biography of the British prime minister David Lloyd George. The first volume, &quot;The Young Lloyd George&quot;, was published in 1973. The second volume, &quot;Lloyd George: The People&#x27;s Champion&quot;, which covered Lloyd George&#x27;s life from 1902 to 1911, was released in 1978 and won the Whitbread Award for biography for that year. In 1985 the third volume, &quot;Lloyd George, From Peace To War 1912–1916&quot;, was published and subsequently received the Wolfson prize. When he died in 2001 Grigg had nearly completed the fourth volume, &quot;Lloyd George: War Leader, 1916–1918&quot;; the final chapter was finished by historian Margaret MacMillan (Lloyd George&#x27;s great-granddaughter) and the book published in 2002. In all the volumes, Grigg showed a remarkable sympathy, and even affinity, for the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot;, despite the fact that their domestic personalities were very different. Historian Robert Blake judged the result to be &quot;a fascinating story and is told with panache, vigour, clarity and impartiality by a great biographer.&quot;

Grigg also wrote a number of other books, including: &quot;Two Anglican Essays&quot; (discussing Anglicanism and changes to the Church of England), &quot;Is the Monarchy Perfect?&quot; (a compendium of some of his writings on the Monarchy), a biography of Nancy Astor; Volume VI in the official history of &quot;The Times&quot; covering the Thomson proprietorship; and &quot;The Victory that Never Was&quot;, in which he argued that the Western Allies prolonged the Second World War for a year by invading Europe in 1944 rather than 1943.

==Personal life==
Grigg married Patricia Campbell, who worked at &quot;National and English Review&quot;, on 3 December 1958 at St Mary Magdalene Church, Tormarton, Gloucestershire. They later adopted two boys.

==In popular culture==
Grigg is portrayed by John Heffernan in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;. The show’s historical consultant, Robert Lacey said, “I am very glad we’ve got this whole episode on Lord Altrincham, who is a well-known figure in England, and now will become so around the world.&quot;

<text>Vincent Descombes (; born 1943) is a French philosopher. His major work has been in the philosophy of language and philosophy of mind.

==Philosophical work==
Descombes is particularly noted for a lengthy critique in two volumes of the project he calls cognitivism, and which is, roughly, the view current in philosophy of mind that mental and psychological facts can ultimately be treated as, or reduced to, physical facts about the brain.

Descombes has also written an introduction to modern French philosophy (&quot;Le même et l&#x27;autre&quot;) focused on the transition, after 1960, from a focus on the three H&#x27;s, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger to the &quot;three masters of suspicion&quot;, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. In the same book, he introduced the term &quot;post-Kojèvian discourse&quot; to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (from 1933 to 1939, Alexandre Kojève delivered in Paris a series of lectures on Hegel&#x27;s work &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; that had an immense influence on 20th-century French philosophy).

Descombes teaches at the Centre de recherches politiques Raymond Aron, part of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. He holds an appointment in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.

Descombes was a member of the French libertarian socialist group Socialisme ou Barbarie.

<text>MS &quot;Gabriella is a [[cruiseferry]] sailing on a route connecting [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] and [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] for [[Viking Line]]. She was built in 1992 in [[Brodosplit]], [[Croatia]] as Frans Suell for service with [[Euroway]]. Between 1994 and 1997 she sailed as Silja Scandinavia&quot; for Silja Line.
&quot;Gabriella&quot; has sister ships &quot;Mega Victoria&quot; operated by Corsica Ferries, &quot;Isabelle&quot; operated by Tallink, and a third one, &quot;Crown Seaways&quot;, operated by DFDS Seaways.

==Concept and construction==
Euroway was a concept developed during the latter half of the 1980s by the Sweden-based Sea-Link Shipping. The new brand was planned to operate two state-of-the-art cruiseferries between Malmö in Sweden and Lübeck in Germany via Travemünde in Germany, with the service aimed in particular at conference groups. Sea-link decided to order the ships from Brodosplit in Croatia, which at that time still was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The ships were based on the same design as the &quot;Amorella&quot; and &quot;Isabella&quot; that had been built by the same shipyard for the Finland-based SF Line for Viking Line traffic in 1988 and 1989, respectively. The Euroway sisters were designed with a somewhat different layout of public spaces and cabins, as well as an additional cabin deck.

The order for the first ship, &quot;Frans Suell&quot;, was placed on 28 September 1989, with the delivery date projected in mid-1991. The ship was launched on 23 January 1991, but due to the Croatian War of Independence her construction was severely delayed, and she was not ready for her first sea trials until January 1992. Following her second sea trials in March 1992 &quot;Frans Suell&quot; sailed to Rijeka for finalization of her construction and to receive the Euroway livery. The ship was finally delivered to her owners on 4 May 1992 and left Split for Malmö.

==Service history==
===1992–1994: &quot;Frans Suell&quot;===
On 16 May 1992 &quot;Frans Suell&quot; was christened in Malmö by the Swedish opera singer Birgit Nilsson. The following day she set on her maiden voyage from Malmö to Travemünde and Lübeck, with only invited guests on board. On 19 May 1992 she began normal service on the Malmö–Travemünde route, with a daily departure from both ports. The service had a troubled start, as marketing had been difficult due to delays in the construction of the ship. Due to restrictions placed by the city of Malmö on traffic through the city, no trucks could be carried on board, and operating the buffet restaurant on board caused difficulties for the company.

From 1 September 1992 onwards &quot;Frans Suell&quot;&#x27;s route was extended to Lübeck for the duration of the northern hemisphere winter season. The call at Travemünde was maintained as the city of Lübeck did not allow cars to be unloaded in the city. Due to the longer crossing times the timetable was altered with departures from every second day from Malmö and Lübeck, with overnight crossings.

On 1 June 1993 Sea-Link Shipping entered an agreement with Silja Line, with the latter assuming marketing and operational responsibility of the Euroway service and ships. The service now became marketed as Silja Line Euroway, with &quot;Silja Festival&quot; joining &quot;Frans Suell&quot; as the second ship on the service (the original planned second ship, &quot;Frans Kockum&quot;, had been even more severely delayed than &quot;Frans Suell&quot;, and eventually Sea-Link cancelled the order). From the beginning of June 1993 &quot;Frans Suell&quot; (and &quot;Silja Festival&quot;)&#x27;s route was again shortened to Malmö–Travemünde, with two daily departures from both ports.

With hopes of attracting more passengers, for the 1993–1994 winter season the route was extended into Copenhagen–Malmö–Travemünde–Lübeck from 1 September 1993 onwards, with daily departures from Copenhagen and Lübeck. Due to the low passenger figures on the service and the poor financial situation of Silja Line, the decision was made to terminate the Euroway service on 12 March 1994. Silja Line wished to charter &quot;Frans Suell&quot; for use on their Turku–Stockholm service, and already on 2 March 1994 she had been chartered to Silja.

===1994–1997: &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot;===
Following the closure of Euroway &quot;Frans Suell&quot; sailed to the Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki, Finland, where she was fitted with rear sponsons, refurbished, painted in Silja Line livery and renamed &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot;. On 31 March 1994 she entered service on the Turku–Stockholm route. Silja Line&#x27;s main rivals Viking Line, who owned two of the ship&#x27;s sisters, were also interested in chartering the ship but thought the price was too high.

As Silja Line&#x27;s charter agreement for &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot; was drawing to a close in 1996, the main funders of Sea-Link demanded that instead of continuing the charter the ship should be sold to the highest bidder. Although Silja Line would have wanted to continue operating the ship, the company was in such a poor financial condition that it could not pay the price asked for the ship. Instead, she was sold to Viking Line on 11 November 1996, with the delivery date planned in April 1997. On 4 April 1997 &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot; arrived for the last time in Turku in Silja Line colours.

===1997 onwards: &quot;Gabriella&quot;===
After ending her service with Silja Line, &quot;Silja Scandinavia&quot; again sailed to the Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki, where she was delivered to Viking Line, refurbished, repainted and renamed &quot;Gabriella&quot; (the name having been chosen by a public naming competition). On 17 April 1997, &quot;Gabriella&quot; entered service for her new owners on the Helsinki–Stockholm route. On 30 June 1999 the a call at Mariehamn was added to the service to maintain tax free sales on board. In 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 the ship spent brief periods sailing on Turku–Mariehamn–Stockholm route, in place of the ship normally used in the service. On 23 January 2004 she collided with the harbour ferry &quot;Ehrensvärd&quot; in the Helsinki harbour, resulting in minor damage to both ships.

Between 5 May 2008 and 27 May 2008, &quot;Gabriella&quot; was rebuilt at Öresundsvarvet in Landskrona, Sweden, as a part of Viking Line&#x27;s fleet rebuilding programme. The refit included the removal of the original cafeteria from deck 7 in favour of expanding the tax-free shop, the addition of a games room on deck 7, the addition of a Tapas &amp; Wine restaurant on deck 8, the conversion of the former BBQ-restaurant into an Ella&#x27;s restaurant, the conversion of the two-storey discothèque on decks 9 and 10 into a new cafeteria, the addition of new cabins in place of the former conference rooms on deck 11, and redecoration of the majority of passenger cabins.

==Accidents==
* On 23 January 2004 &quot;Gabriella&quot; collided with the Suomenlinna island ferry &quot;Ehrensvärd&quot;. Gabriella got a small hole under the waterline.
* On 12 January 2022 &quot;Gabriella&quot; underwent a blackout and collided into a pier in Helsinki in front of the Allas Sea Pool. The ship got large scratches and notches into its hull and the bow was slightly damaged above the waterline and at the bulbous bow. The Allas Sea Pool sauna building was split into two in the middle and part of the structure moved tens of centimetres towards the Market Square. The ship was moved to the Turku repairs shipyard in Naantali for repairs. &quot;Viking Cinderella&quot; replaced the ship for the duration of repairs. &quot;Gabriella&quot; returned to traffic in late February.

<doc id="861086" wikidata="Q348536" url="?curid=861086" title="Adam A700">
<text>The Adam A700 AdamJet was a proposed six-seat civil utility aircraft developed by Adam Aircraft Industries starting in 2003. The aircraft was developed in parallel with the generally similar Adam A500, although while that aircraft is piston-engined, the A700 is powered by two Williams FJ33 turbofans. The two models have about 80% commonality.

The prototype A700 first flew on July 28, 2003. Two conforming prototypes were built.

==Development==
Adam Aircraft ceased operations on 11 February 2008 and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation on 19 February 2008, prior to the certification or delivery of any production A700s.

In April 2008 Adam Aircraft was purchased from bankruptcy by AAI Acquisition Inc who have indicated their intention to continue with certification of the aircraft.

Industrial Investments, the Russian company that purchased Adam Aircraft, restarted work on the A700 and in May 2008 had 60 employees back at work. Industrial Investments reportedly ordered 75 A700s prior to Adam Aircraft&#x27;s bankruptcy. AAI had initially intended to certify the A700 in the first quarter of 2010, but citing the economic crisis of 2008 President and CEO Jack Braly announced on 28 October 2008 that &quot;Flight test and other development activity have been suspended&quot;. Braly indicated that the company&#x27;s investment team and board of directors are reviewing the economic and market conditions and will decide on a new schedule for certifying the A700.

The Federal Aviation Administration accepted the previous certification data that Adam Aircraft recorded, which would have greatly simplified certification efforts by the new company, however in April 2009 Adam Aircraft ceased operations and laid off all its staff, ending development of the A700.

In April 2011 Triton Aerospace, the new holder of the type certificate, indicated that they would concentrate on the A500 and had no plans to continue development of the A700, even though they had two disassembled examples.

==Design==
As with the earlier-designed A500 piston-engined model, the A700 featured a straight tapered wing, a central fuselage, and twin wing-mounted booms which supported aft twin rudders linked by a high horizontal stabilizer. Unlike on the A500, the A700&#x27;s two engines were mounted on the sides of the fuselage, in a non-centerline thrust arrangement, eliminating one of the design advantages of the A500 configuration.

In order to balance the twin rear-mounted engines properly, the forward fuselage was lengthened by 4 feet. In the A500, the front engine is balanced by the rear engine and empennage. In the A700, the longer front fuselage balances the rear engines and empennage.

<text>The Galway Races (Irish: &quot;Rásaí na Gaillimhe&quot;) is an Irish horse-racing festival that starts on the last Monday of July every year. Held at Ballybrit Racecourse in Galway, Ireland over seven days, it is one of the longest of all the race meets that occur in Ireland.

The busiest days of the festival are Wednesday, when the Galway Plate is held, and Thursday, when the Galway Hurdle and Ladies&#x27; Day take place.

==Festival history==
The first racing festival held in Ballybrit was a two-day event with the first race meeting on Tuesday, 17 August 1869. The summer festival was extended to a 3-day meeting in 1959, 4 days in 1971, 5 days in 1974, 6 days in 1982 and, most recently to, 7 days in 1999. The summer festival is the highlight of the business year for most local businesses as crowds and horses flock from all over the world to attend one of the world&#x27;s biggest race meetings.

The pub underneath the Corrib Stand, built in 1955, was for many years the longest bar in the world. It was replaced by the Millennium Stand which opened in 1999. The Killanin Stand opened in 2007 replacing the old Corrib (west) Stand.

On the 4th day of the Galway races there was a race meeting held in Tuam. The last race meeting held at Tuam racecourse was in 1973.

Additional race meetings also take place in September and October, but these are not as popular as the summer festival, which draws more than 150,000 spectators.

On 21 April 2020, the Galway Race Committee announced that the 2020 summer festival—scheduled for 27 July to 2 August—was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would be held behind closed doors for the first time since 1869.

The 2021 festival was held with a maximum of 1,000 people allowed to attend each day.

The festival returned to full capacity in 2022 with over 130,000 people expected to attend over the week.

==In culture==
The Galway Races are the subject of &quot;At Galway Races&quot;, a poem by W. B. Yeats. They are also the subject of an eponymous folk song, popularized by The Clancy Brothers, The Chieftains, and The Dubliners. The Celtic rock band, JSD Band played it on their album, &quot;Travelling Days&quot;. The song also appears on The Kreellers 2008 release, &quot;Sixth and Porter&quot;. Further, it constitutes the last third of the track Medley on the 1988 album &quot;If I Should Fall from Grace with God&quot; by The Pogues (the two first parts being The Recruiting Sergeant and an instrumental version of Rocky Road to Dublin).

In 2009, TG4 broadcast a comedy TV series, &quot;Rásaí na Gaillimhe&quot;, that unfolds during Galway Race Week.

The second Wonder Girl, [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Cassie Sandsmark]], was created by John Byrne and first appeared in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 2) #105 (January 1996). Both are protégées of Wonder Woman and members of different incarnations of the Teen Titans. The alias has also been used in reference to a younger version of Wonder Woman as a teenager. In the 2020s, DC introduced a third Wonder Girl in [[Yara Flor]], who hails from a Brazilian tribe of Amazons and was shown in a flashforward to one day succeed Diana as Wonder Woman.

An original version of Wonder Girl named Drusilla appeared in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; television series, played by Debra Winger. Donna Troy makes her live adaptation debut in the DC Universe series &quot;Titans&quot;, played by Conor Leslie.

==Fictional character biographies==
===Diana===

A teen-aged Princess Diana of the Amazons first appeared in a backstory in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #23 (May/June 1947), written by William Moulton Marston and designed by H.G. Peter.

Wonder Girl first appeared in &quot;The Secret Origin of Wonder Woman&quot;, written and edited by Robert Kanigher, in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #105 (April 1959). In this revised Silver Age origin, it is established that Diana had in fact not been created from clay, but had been born before the Amazons settled on Paradise Island. Following this issue were several Wonder Girl adventures, and years later an additional character, Wonder Tot—Wonder Woman as a toddler—was also featured. Kanigher restored the character&#x27;s made-from-clay origin in 1966.

From &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #124 (August 1961) onward, Wonder Woman, Wonder Girl, and Wonder Tot frequently appeared together in stories that were labeled &quot;impossible tales&quot;, presented as films made by Wonder Woman&#x27;s mother, Queen Hippolyta, who had the power to splice together films of herself and Diana at different ages. The characters of Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman then began to diverge, as Bob Haney wrote Wonder Girl stories that took place in the same time period as those of Wonder Woman.

The last significant appearance of Wonder Woman as a child Wonder Girl was in November 1965. In the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #158, Kanigher broke the fourth wall by having Wonder Girl and the rest of the supporting cast he had created (Wonder Tot, the Glop, Bird-Boy, Mer-Boy, Birdman, and Manno) come to the office of a &quot;certain&quot; editor. Protested by fans for ruining the character, Kanigher tells Wonder Girl that he does love her, along with all of his other daughters, such as Black Canary, Star Sapphire, and the Harlequin. Even so, with mounting pressure, he has no choice but to declare her retconned. Wonder Girl stoically accepts her fate as she and the others turn into drawings on Kanigher&#x27;s desk. Soon after, Wonder Woman enters and is shocked to see her younger self &quot;killed&quot;.

Regardless, Diana as a child Wonder Girl was never completely rejected. Reprints of Wonder Girl stories were occasionally included in the comic book. In issue #200, Wonder Woman, in her Diana Prince identity, is shown walking past children at play whereon she flashes back to when she was a fourteen-year-old Wonder Girl with a crush on Mer-Boy.

===Donna Troy===

While the characters of Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were diverging, Haney was developing a new group of junior superheroes, whose first informal appearance featured a team-up of Robin (Dick Grayson), Kid Flash (Wally West), and Aqualad (Garth). During their next appearance in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #60 (July 1965), they were dubbed the Teen Titans and joined by Wonder Girl, pictured in the same frame as Wonder Woman and calling Hippolyta &quot;mother&quot;.

Wonder Girl and the other Teen Titans were then featured in &quot;Showcase&quot; #59 (December 1965) before being spun off into their own series with &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #1 (February 1966). With the character called only Wonder Girl, or &quot;Wonder Chick&quot; by her teammates, her status as either the younger Wonder Woman displaced in the timeline or another character altogether is not explained until &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #22 (August 1969). In a story by Marv Wolfman and Gil Kane it is established that Wonder Girl is a non-Amazon orphan, rescued by Wonder Woman from an apartment building fire. Unable to find any parents or family, Wonder Woman brings the child to Paradise Island, where she is eventually given Amazon powers by the Purple Ray. The story ends with Wonder Girl wearing a new costume and hairstyle, adopting the secret identity Donna Troy.

====Multiple origins====
As special event comics like the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries have rewritten character histories, the origin of Donna Troy has been revised several times. In brief, those origins are as follows:

# Rescued orphan: Donna Troy was rescued from an apartment building fire by Wonder Woman, who took her to Paradise Island to be raised as an Amazon by Queen Hippolyta.
# Titan Seed: The Titan Rhea had rescued a young Donna from a fire, adding her to a group of 12 orphans from around the universe who had been raised on New Cronus by these Titans as &quot;Titan Seeds&quot;, their eventual saviors. The Seeds had been given superhuman powers and named after ancient Greek cities. Called &quot;Troy&quot;, Donna (like the others) had eventually been stripped of her memories of her time with the Titans of Myth, and reintroduced into humankind to await her destiny. In this version, Donna was not an Amazon and had no connection to Wonder Woman.
# Infinite Lives of Donna Troy: In a revision that incorporated the Titan Seed continuity while reattaching Donna Troy to Wonder Woman, it is revealed that the Amazon sorceress Magala had animated a mirror image of young Princess Diana to create for her a mystical, &quot;identical twin&quot; playmate. This twin is soon mistaken for Diana and kidnapped by Dark Angel (revealed in the Return of Donna Troy mini-series to be the Donna Troy of Earth 7). Dark Angel disperses the girl&#x27;s spirit across the multiverse, condemning her to live multiple lives, each one cut short by the Dark Angel at a moment of tragedy. In at least one of these variant lives, Donna would become a superhero and encounter her grown sister, now Wonder Woman, and their mother Queen Hippolyta, without realizing who she really was or how she was related to them. After that timeline ends with the death of Donna&#x27;s son, Diana and Hippolyta intervene to find what happened to Donna. Donna finally defeats Dark Angel, destroying the evil entity and regaining her original Amazon powers. She returns to reality to continue her life from that point.
# Pre Flashpoint version: &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 3) Annual #1 gives Donna a new origin that combines elements of her three variant origins. Donna was born as Princess Diana&#x27;s mystic twin through the help of Amazon sorceress Magala. Months later, an old enemy of Queen Hippolyta, called Dark Angel, kidnapped Donna thinking she was Diana. Donna was placed in suspended animation by Dark Angel for years but was eventually rescued and returned to the Amazons&#x27; home, where she received training from both the Amazons and the Titans of Myth and was raised as Queen Hippolyta&#x27;s second daughter. Years later, she followed Wonder Woman into the outside world as Wonder Girl and helped form the Teen Titans.
# New 52/Rebirth: Donna was created out of clay as part of a plan to destroy Wonder Woman. The Amazons later gave her false memories of being an orphan rescued by Wonder Woman allowing her to live a normal life.
# Infinite Frontier: Following the Multiversal upheaval of &quot;Dark Knights: Metal&quot;, Donna&#x27;s original backstory of a rescued orphan raised on Paradise Island was restored to canon.

===Cassandra Sandsmark===

Cassie Sandsmark is the granddaughter of Zeus. She has been a member of both Young Justice and the Teen Titans. Initially, her powers were derived from ancient Greek magical artifacts. Later, Zeus granted her the boon of actual powers. Her powers are similar to Wonder Woman&#x27;s, though she carries a lasso that expels Zeus&#x27;s lightning, which was given to her by her father, Ares, the Greek god of war. When the Greek gods left the mortal plane during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Zeus stripped Cassie of her powers. However, she was granted powers by Ares in exchange for becoming his champion.

After Superboy&#x27;s death, she quit the Titans for a time to be an independent vigilante. She was mourning the loss of her lover, Superboy, and bitter from the abandonment by Robin and Wonder Woman over the following year. She later rejoined the group after a battle with the Brotherhood of Evil and the return of Cyborg. She is close friends with fellow hero Supergirl. She later didn&#x27;t need anyone to empower her as she grew stronger herself.

===Yara Flor===

Yara Flor is the daughter of an Amazon and a Brazilian river god, who becomes the defender of the Esquecida Amazon tribe. The character debuted in January 2021 as part of DC Comic&#x27;s &quot;Future State&quot; storyline, in which she is shown to be the Wonder Woman of the future. In the present day DC Comics narrative, Yara is introduced as part of the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; publishing event. She is unaware of her Amazon heritage, but, responding to a prophecy, the Olympian Gods and the Amazons of Themiscyra, Bana-Mighdall, and a third tribe in the Amazon rainforest separately begin to converge on her location as she makes a trip from the US to Brazil, the country of her birth. Queen Hippolyta sends Wonder Girl Cassie Sandsmark to protect Yara, where she encounters Artemis of Bana-Mighdall.

As an Amazon-Guarani demigoddess, Yara inherits abilities the average Amazon does not. Yara has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, durability, agility and senses. Yara also has the ability of hydrokinesis (manipulating water), which she discovers after she gets her golden bolas. Yara also rides a white winged horse from Olympus named Jerry.

According to the character&#x27;s creator, Joëlle Jones, Yara&#x27;s appearance was inspired by the Brazilian model Suyane Moreira.

==Alternate versions==
===&quot;Tiny Titans&quot;===
Both Donna and Cassie have a recurring roles in the &quot;Tiny Titans&quot; comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. The two are depicted as cousins, with the Wonder Girl alias given to Donna and Cassie being referred to by her first name.

===&quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;===
In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; , Wonder Girl first appears in 1953 as a &quot;mystic projection&quot; to take Wonder Woman&#x27;s place while Diana gives birth. She finds a wounded Steve Trevor and takes him back to Paradise Island, but despite being subjected to the Purple Power Ray, he dies of his wounds, leaving Diana to raise their daughter, Stephanie, alone.

In 1964, Stephanie (or &quot;Stevie&quot;) decides to go out on her own as Wonder Girl. She shares a link with Supergirl (Kara Kent), as they were born at the same time. Years later, she becomes the new Wonder Woman. Her outfit is pretty much the same as her mother&#x27;s, except that she does not possess either the tiara or the Magic Lasso of Aphrodite, instead possessing the winged sandals of Hermes. She also wears a mask. When she becomes the new Wonder Woman, she adds a cape to the ensemble. In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; , she is killed by Darkseid.

===&quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot;===
In the &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot; universe, Wonder Girl is not a single person, but rather a team of young Asian-American girls who are empowered by the mystical artifacts formerly used by Wonder Woman. The Wonder Girls consist of Donna Troy (a Nisei Japanese-American), Cassie Sandsmark (a mixed-race girl of partial Japanese heritage), Yuki and Yuri Katsura, and Emily Sung.

<text>Cres (; , , , , ) is an Adriatic island in Croatia. It is one of the northern islands in the Kvarner Gulf and can be reached via ferry from Rijeka, Krk island or from the Istrian peninsula (line Brestova-Porozina).

With an area of , Cres has the same size as the neighbouring Krk island. In 2011, Cres had a population of 3,079 people.

In the past, Cres and the neighbouring island of Lošinj used to be one island, but now they are divided by a channel and connected by a bridge that starts from the town of Osor. Cres&#x27;s only freshwater source is Lake Vrana.

==History==
Cres has been inhabited since the Paleolithic time period. In ancient times, Cres and Lošinj were called Apsyrtides. In the past, the two islands were connected, but due to the needs of trade, these islands were separated by an artificially dug canal near Osor. Its name predates classical antiquity and derives from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*(s)quer-&quot; (&quot;cliff&quot;). When the town was founded and inhabited by ancient Greeks, it was called Chersos (Χέρσος), which in Greek means &quot;barren land&quot;, &quot;uncultivated land&quot; or &quot;dry heaths&quot;. Later, &quot;Chersos&quot; was resounded to &quot;Cresta&quot;, from which eventually the modern name &quot;Cherso-Cres&quot; came.

Cres was ruled by the Greeks until the first century B.C., when the Roman Empire made the island part of the province of Liburnia. After the fall of the Roman Empire the island became part of the Byzantine Empire as one of the Dalmatian city-states, and remained this way for centuries. Slavs first arrived on the island in the early 9th century (believed to be somewhere around 812).

Around 866, the inhabitants saw their first conflicts with the Republic of Venice. The Venetians eventually took control of Cres and the neighboring islands during the 10th and 11th centuries.

After Napoleon&#x27;s victory over the Venetians, the control of the island was given to the Austrian Empire. After the defeat of Austria by Napoleon in 1809, the island became part of the French Empire.

After the fall of Napoleon, Austria took control of the island once again and kept it for a century. During this time the economy developed, thanks to the olive trees, sage, and other plants becoming a key part to the success of the island. At the end of World War I, with the Treaty of Rapallo signed in 1920, the island was handed over to the Kingdom of Italy.

Italian rule over the island did not last long. Because of Italy alliance with the Axis Powers during World War II, Cres was handed over to Yugoslavia in 1947 along with neighbouring islands and the Istrian Peninsula.

The island has gone through an agricultural downturn as many residents left the island for the mainland or abroad. This has resulted in many former agricultural areas becoming overgrown with local vegetation. Recently, people, primarily retirees, have been returning to live on the island. Tourism has become an increasingly important industry and the population experiences significant seasonal variation.

==Towns of Cres==
The island has several villages, all of them connected by a road that runs down the middle of the island. On one side is the ferry from Porozina to Brestova (in Istria). Another ferry runs from Merag to Valbiska (on the neighbouring island of Krk); on the other is the bridge to Lošinj, which was once connected by land, but is now separated by a waterway. 

A list of the villages with descriptions is below:
* Belej
* Beli – This small village, at the end of a long and very narrow road, is home to a famed bird species, the endangered Griffon vulture.
* Cres
* Lubenice – An ancient mountain village with a great view of the sea and neighboring islands. A restaurant and bar operate during the warmer months. Weekly musical concerts take place during the peak tourist season.
* Martinšćica – The home of a large vacation complex, Slatina, along with beaches and cafes. It also has an essential oils distillery. The town also has a small castle, known as &quot;&quot;, which was once inhabited by a &quot;Sforza&quot; family of Italian nobility (apparently unrelated to the famous Milanese house) and by Napoleonic Imperial forces, before becoming a restaurant which recently closed.
* Merag - with ferry connections.
* Miholašćica – A small village with a church which shares the same name as the community. Tourism has grown here since the arrival of the Zaglav community nearby.
* Orlec – Another small village at the end of a narrow road, also home to the endangered vulture.
* Osor – A town on the &quot;border&quot; between two islands. Founded by the Romans who also dug the channel thus dividing what was then known as the Osor island into Cres and Lošinj. Then a major port and commercial centre started to fade with coming of larger ships that could not pass the narrow channel or dock in the shallow port.
* Pernat – The westernmost village on Cape Pernat. A quaint and rustic village forming a gateway to numerous walking trails and secluded beaches.
* Mali Podol – Between Lubenice and Valun. A tiny hamlet that resembles a large farmhouse. Its key feature is the mulberry tree located in the middle of the road.
* Porozina – A small village comprising the ferry terminal and a few shops.
* Punta Križa – The southernmost part of Cres. FKK resort is here.

* Stivan – On a side street this small hamlet of 16 people features a very private beach, old houses and a church, and is on the way to other villages.
* Valun – Visible on the way to Lubenice (see below), this village does not permit cars. A fee is charged for parking.
* Vidovići – A short distance uphill from Martinšćica. A village with an extraordinary view of the Istrian Peninsula and numerous islands including Zeča, Lošinj, and Unije forming part of the archipelago. A restaurant &quot;Mali Raj&quot; once operated in the evenings during the warmer months.

==Lake Vrana==
Cres has its own fresh water lake, which is very highly guarded and illegal to swim or fish in. It supplies water to neighboring Lošinj as well. It is the largest lake in Croatia by volume and one of the deepest fresh water lakes in Eastern Europe, going down at its deepest point (&gt; below sea-level).

==Flora and fauna==
Cres is home to many different types of nonvenomous snakes, including &quot;Elaphe quatuorlineata&quot;, &quot;Zamenis longissimus&quot;, &quot;Zamenis situla&quot;, and &quot;Natrix tessellata&quot;, a snake rare or absent on other Adriatic islands.

===Birds===
The island has a relatively large breeding population of the endangered Eurasian griffon vulture, which can often be seen soaring over the island. It forms part of the Kvarner Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of many bird species, including breeding populations of many birds of prey.

== Climate ==
The main part of Cres features a mid-latitude humid subtropical climate (Köppen : &quot;Cfa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. Winters are cool and damp, punctuated by the Bora wind and summers are hot and quite dry, bordering on a hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). Further south, Lošinj island enjoys a true hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with cool and damp winters and hot, distinctly dry summers.

<doc id="861115" wikidata="Q751660" url="?curid=861115" title="Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Mid Ulster is a parliamentary constituency in the UK House of Commons. The current MP is Cathal Mallaghan, of Sinn Féin, who was first elected at the 2024 election.

==Constituency profile==
The seat covers a rural area to the west of Lough Neagh, including part of the Sperrins. Since 1997, the seat has been nationalist-leaning.

==Boundaries==

1950–1983: The Urban Districts of Cookstown, Omagh, and Strabane, the Rural Districts of Castlederg, Cookstown, Magherafelt, and Strabane, and that part of the Rural District of Omagh not contained within the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.

1983–1997: the Cookstown District Council; the Omagh District Council; the Magherafelt District Council wards of Ballymaguigan, Draperstown, and Lecumpher; and the Strabane District Council wards of Castlederg, Clare, Finn, Glenderg, Newtownstewart, Plumbridge, Sion Mills, and Victoria Bridge.

1997–present: the District of Cookstown; the District of Magherafelt; and the Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council wards of Altmore, Coalisland North, Coalisland South, Coalisland West and Newmills, Donaghmore, and Washing Bay.

The constituency was created in 1950 when the old two-seat constituency of Fermanagh and Tyrone was abolished as part of the final move to single-member seats. Originally, the seat primarily consisted of the northern, eastern and western parts of County Tyrone, with the south included in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Of the post-1973 districts, it contained all of Omagh and Cookstown and part of Strabane and Magherafelt.

In boundary changes proposed by a review in 1995, the seat was split in two, with the name retained by the eastern half, even though it contained only 30% of the old seat. The western half became the nucleus of the new West Tyrone constituency. The new Mid Ulster also gained areas from East Londonderry and Fermanagh and South Tyrone, taking it deeper into County Londonderry.

==History==
For the history of the constituency prior to 1950, see Fermanagh and Tyrone.

In both its incarnations, Mid Ulster has seen a precarious balance between unionist and Irish nationalist voters, although in recent years the nationalists have advanced significantly to be in a clear majority. Many elections have seen a candidate from one side triumph due to candidates from the other side splitting the vote.

The seat was initially won by the Irish Nationalist Party in 1950 and 1951 then by Sinn Féin in 1955. However the Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) was unseated on petition on the basis that his Irish Republican Army (IRA) convictions made him ineligible, and in subsequent by-elections the seat was won by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).

In a by-election in 1969, the seat was won by Bernadette Devlin standing as an independent socialist nationalist on the &quot;Unity&quot; ticket, which sought to unite nationalist voters behind a single candidate. At the age of 21, Devlin was the youngest person ever elected to the House of Commons in the era of universal suffrage. The by-election saw a 91.5% turnout, a record for any UK by-election.

Devlin held her seat in the 1970 general election but generated controversy when she had a child while still unmarried as well as for her fierce anti-clericalism. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) stood a candidate against her in the February 1974 general election and the nationalist vote was strongly divided, allowing John Dunlop of the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party to win with the support of the UUP and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

Dunlop held his seat for the next nine years, though in 1975 he was part of a large section of Vanguard that broke away to form the short-lived United Ulster Unionist Party. He held his seat in 1979 only owing to a unionist pact. He polled poorly in the 1982 Assembly election, taking 2.8% of the vote. Consequently, he did not stand again in 1983, and the following year the UUUP was wound up.

The 1983 general election saw a fierce contest for the seat, with the UUP, DUP, SDLP and Sinn Féin all polling strongly. The winner was the DUP&#x27;s William McCrea, by a narrow majority of just 78 over Sinn Féin&#x27;s Danny Morrison. In general elections from then to 2005 the UUP did not contest the seat.

Following the boundary changes, McCrea contested the new Mid Ulster in 1997 but, by then, Sinn Féin had established itself as the most likely party to outpoll a unionist and so drew votes from the SDLP, resulting in Martin McGuinness winning. He held the seat at the general elections of 2001, 2005 and 2010. During the 2001 general election, Mid Ulster had the highest turnout in any constituency in the United Kingdom.

On 11 June 2012, McGuinness announced his intention to resign from the House of Commons to concentrate on his position as Deputy First Minister and avoid so-called &#x27;double jobbing&#x27; by which members of the Northern Ireland Assembly also work as councillors or MPs. This necessitated a by-election. On 30 December 2012, Martin McGuinness formally announced he would resign his Westminster seat with immediate effect. Sinn Féin&#x27;s Francie Molloy won the resulting by-election in March 2013.

===Elections in the 1990s===








Between 1992 and 1996 there were significant boundary changes, creating the new seat of West Tyrone. This had a huge knock on effect on Mid Ulster, which lost all its areas in Omagh and Strabane district councils, and gained the Torrent LGD in Dungannon from Fermanagh and South Tyrone, and the parts of Magherafelt District Council previously in East Londonderry. Therefore, the implied 1992 election results are very different from the actual ones and are displayed above.

The seat was awarded to Beattie on petition on the grounds that Mitchell&#x27;s conviction as a felon made him ineligible to sit in Parliament. However, Beattie in turn was also found ineligible to sit due to holding an office of profit under the crown, triggering a further by-election.




Mitchell was subsequently unseated by a resolution of the House of Commons, on the grounds that his terrorist convictions made him ineligible to sit in Parliament.

<doc id="861121" wikidata="Q2396897" url="?curid=861121" title="Christian name">
<text>A Christian name, sometimes referred to as a baptismal name, is a religious personal name given on the occasion of a Christian baptism, though now most often given by parents at birth. In English-speaking cultures, a person&#x27;s Christian name is commonly their first name and is typically the name by which the person is primarily known.

Traditionally, a Christian name was given on the occasion of Christian baptism, with the ubiquity of infant baptism in modern and medieval Christendom. In Elizabethan England, as suggested by William Camden, the term &quot;Christian name&quot; was not necessarily related to baptism, used merely in the sense of &quot;given name&quot;: Christian names were imposed for the distinction of persons, surnames for the difference of families. In more modern times, the terms have been used interchangeably with &quot;given name&quot;, &quot;first name&quot; and &quot;forename&quot; in traditionally Christian countries, and are still common in day-to-day use.

Strictly speaking, the Christian name is not merely the forename distinctive of the individual member of a family, but the name given to the person (generally a child) at their christening or baptism. In pre-Reformation England, the laity was taught to administer baptism in case of necessity with the words: &quot;I christen thee in the name of the Father&quot; etc. To &quot;christen&quot; in this context is therefore to &quot;baptise&quot;, and &quot;Christian name&quot; means &quot;baptismal name&quot;.

==Origin==
In view of the Hebrew practice of giving a name to the male child at the time of his circumcision on the eighth day after birth (Luke 1:59), it has been maintained that the custom of conferring a name upon the newly baptised was of Apostolic origin. For instance, the apostle of the Gentiles was called Saul before his conversion and Paul afterwards. But modern scholars have rejected this contention, since the baptism of St. Paul is recorded in Acts 9:18, but the name Paul does not occur before Acts 13:9 while Saul is found several times in the interval. There is no more reason to connect the name Paul with the Apostle&#x27;s baptism than there is to account in the same way for the giving of the name Cephas or Peter, which is due to another cause. In the inscriptions of the Catacombs of Rome and in early Christian literature, the names of Christians in the first three centuries did not distinctively differ from the names of the pagans around them. A reference to the Epistles of St. Paul indicates that the names of pre-Christian gods and goddesses were used by his converts after their conversion as before. Hermes occurs in Romans 16:14, with a number of other purely pagan names, Epaphroditus in Phil. 4:18, Phoebe, the deaconess, in Romans 16:1.

Similar names are found in the Christian inscriptions of the earlier period and in the signatories appended to such councils as Nicaea or Ancyra, or again in the lists of martyrs. At a later date the names are of a most miscellaneous character. The following classification is one that has been worked out by J. Bass Mullinger founded on Martigny.

===Names without Christian origin and significance===
This category may be divided as follows:

* derived unchanged or but slightly modified from pagan mythology, e.g., Mercurius, Bacchus, Apollos (I Corinthians 16:12), Hermogenes (Romans 16:4), etc.
* from religious rites or omens, e.g., Augustus, Auspicius, Augurius, Optatus;
* from numbers, e.g., Primus, Primigenius, Secundinus, Quartus, Octavia, etc.
* from colours, e.g., Albanus, Candidus, Rufus, etc.
* from animals and birds, e.g., Agnes, Asellus, Columbia, Leo, Taurus, Ursula, etc.
* from agriculture, e.g., Agricia, Armentarius, Palmatinus, Stereorius, etc.
* from flowers, e.g., Balsamia, Flosculus, Narcissus, Rosula;
* from jewels, e.g., Chrysanthus, Margarites, Smaragdus;
* from military life or the sea, e.g., Emerentiana, Navigia, Pelagia, Seutarius, Thalassus;
* from countries, cities, rivers etc.; Afra, Cydnus, Galla, Jordanis, Macedonius, Maurus, Sabina, Sebastianus, etc.
* from the months e.g., Aprilis, Januaria, Junia, etc.
* from personal qualities, etc., e.g., Aristo, Hilarius, Modestus, Pudens, etc.;
* from servile condition, e.g., Servus, Servilianus, Vernacla;
* names of historical celebrity, e.g., Caesarius, Cornelia, Pompeius, Ptolemaeus, Vergilius

===Names with Christian origin and significance===
These include the following:

* apparently suggested by Christian dogmas, e.g. Anastasia, Athanasia, Christophorus, Redemptus, Restitutus, etc.
* from festivals or rites, e.g., Epiphanius, Eulogia, Natalis, Pascasia, Sabbatius and the frequently recurring Martyrius;
* from Christian virtues, e.g., Agape, Elpis, Fides, Irene, with such derivatives as Adelphius, Agapetus, Caritosa, etc.
* pious sentiment, e.g., Adeodata, Ambrosius, Benedictus, Deogratias, etc., and possibly such names as Gaudentianus, Hilarius, Sozomen, Victorianus, Vincentius

Though the recurrence of such names as Agnes, Balbina, Cornelius, Felicitas, Irenaeus, Justinus, etc. may be due to veneration for the martyrs who first used these names, the names of the New Testament are rarely found while those of the Hebrew Bible are more common. Susanna, Daniel, Moses, Tobias, occur frequently, but towards the end of the 4th century the name of the Blessed Lady becomes as familiar as those of the Apostles. Paulus may be an intentional reference to St. Paul, and Johannes, Andreas, and Petrus with derivatives such as Petronia, Petrius, Petronilla, etc. may also refer to the Apostles. The name of Mary occurs occasionally in the catacomb inscriptions towards the end of the 4th century, for example, in the form &quot;LIVIA MARIA IN PACE&quot;, and there is a martyr Maria assigned to the date AD 256.

==Change of name at baptism==
In the Acts of St. Balsamus, who died AD 331, there is an early example of the connection between baptism and the giving of a name. &quot;By my paternal name&quot;, this martyr is said to have declared, &quot;I am called Balsamus, but by the spiritual name which I received in baptism, I am known as Peter.&quot; The assumption of a new name was fairly common amongst Christians. Eusebius the historian took the name Pamphili from Pamphilus, the martyr whom he especially venerated. Earlier still St. Cyprian chose to be called Cyprianus Caecilius out of gratitude to the Caecilius to whom he owed his conversion. St. Dionysius of Alexandria (c. 260) declared, &quot;I am of opinion that there were many of the same name as the Apostle John, who on account of their love for him, and because they admired and emulated him, and desired to be loved by the Lord as he was, took to themselves the same name, just as many of the children of the faithful are called Paul or Peter.&quot;

The assumption of any such new name would take place formally at baptism, in which the catechumen, then probably as now, had to be addressed by some distinctive appellation, and the imposition of a new name at baptism had become general. Every child had necessarily to receive some name or other, and when baptism followed soon after birth this allowed public recognition of the choice made.

In the thirtieth of the supposed &quot;Arabian Canons of Nicaea&quot;: &quot;Of giving only names of Christians in baptism&quot;; but the sermons of St. John Chrysostom assume in many different places that the conferring of a name, presumably at baptism, ought to be regulated by some idea of Christian edification, and he implies that such had been the practice of earlier generations. For example, he says: &quot;When it comes to giving the infant a name, caring not to call it after the saints, as the ancients at first did, people light lamps and give them names and so name the child after the one which continues burning the longest, from thence conjecturing that he will live a long time&quot; (Hom. in Cor., xii, 13).

Similarly he commends the practice of the parents of Antioch in calling their children after the martyr Meletius (P.G. 50, 515) and urges his hearers not to give their children the first name that occurs, nor to seek to gratify fathers or grandfathers or other family connections by giving their names, but rather to choose the names of holy men conspicuous for virtue and for their courage before God (P.G. 53, 179). There are other historic examples of such a change of name in adult converts.

Socrates (Hist. Eccl., VII, xxi) wrote of Athenais who married the Emperor Theodosius the Younger, and who previously to marriage was baptized (AD 421) receiving the name Eudoxia.

Bede wrote that King Caedwalla went to Rome and was baptized by the Pope Sergius who gave him the name of Peter. Dying soon afterwards he was buried in Rome and his epitaph beginning &quot;Hic depositus est Caedwalla qui est Petrus&quot; was pointed out (Bede, &quot;Hist. Eccl.&quot;, V, vii).

Later Guthrum the Danish leader in England after his long contest with King Alfred was eventually defeated, and consenting to accept Christianity was baptized in 878, taking the name Æthelstan.

==Practice regarding names==
Various Fathers and spiritual writers and synodal decrees have exhorted Christians to give no names to their children in baptism but those of canonized saints or of the angels of God, but at no point in the history of the Church were these injunctions strictly attended to.

They were not observed during the early or the later Middle Ages. In extensive lists of medieval names, such as those found in the indexes of legal proceedings which have been edited in modern times, while ordinary names without religious associations, such as William, Robert, Roger, Geoffrey, Hugh, etc. are common (around the year 1200, William was by far the most common Christian name in England), there are also a number of exceptional names which have apparently no religious associations at all. These include Ademar, Ailma, Ailward, Albreza, Alditha, Almaury, Ascelina, Avice, Aystorius (these come from the lists of those cured at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury). A rubric in the official &quot;Rituale Romanum&quot; mandates that the priest ought to see that names of deities or of godless pagans are not given in baptism (&quot;curet ne obscoena, fabulosa aut ridicula vel inanium deorum vel impiorum ethnicorum hominum nomina imponantur&quot;).

A pronouncement from Bourges (1666) addressing parents and godparents urges: &quot;Let them give to boys the names of male saints and to girls those of women saints as right order requires, and let them avoid the names of festivals like Easter (&quot;Pâques&quot;), Christmas (&quot;Noël&quot;), All Saints (&quot;Toussaint&quot;) and others that are sometimes chosen.&quot; Despite such injunctions &quot;Toussaint&quot; has become a common French Christian name and &quot;Noël&quot; has also found popularity abroad. The addition of Marie, especially in the form Jean-Marie, for boys, and of Josèphe (Marie-Josèphe), for girls, may be found in present-day France.

In Spain and Italy Marian festivals have also created names for girls: &quot;Concepción&quot;, of which the diminutive is &quot;Concha&quot;, as well as &quot;Asunción, Encarnación, Mercedes, Dolores&quot; etc. in Spanish, and in Italian &quot;Assunta, Annunziata, Concetta&quot;, etc.
The name Mary has not always been a favourite for girls. In England in the 12th century, Mary as a Christian name was rare. The name George, often given in recognition of the Saint George the patron saint of England, was not common in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it grew in popularity after the Protestant Reformation.

In the registers of Oxford University from 1560 to 1621, the more common names used by the students in order of popularity were: John, 3826; Thomas, 2777; William, 2546; Richard, 1691; Robert, 1222; Edward, 957; Henry, 908; George, 647; Francis, 447; James, 424; Nicholas, 326; Edmund, 298. In Italy and Spain it has been common practice to call a child after the saint upon whose feast they are born.

==Confirmation names==
The practice of adopting a new name was not limited to baptism. Many medieval examples show that any notable change of condition, especially in the spiritual order, was often accompanied by the reception of a new name. In the 8th century, the two Englishmen Winfrith and Willibald going on different occasions to Rome received from the Pope, along with a new commission to preach, the names respectively of Boniface and Clement. Emma of Normandy when she married King Ethelred in 1002 took the name Ælfgifu; while the reception of a new, monastic name upon entering a religious order remains almost universal.

At confirmation, in which the interposition of a godfather emphasizes the resemblance with baptism, it has been customary to take a new name, but usually, use made of it is infrequent. In the case of Henry III, King of France, godson of the English Edward VI had been christened Edouard Alexandre in 1551, the same French prince at confirmation received the name of Henri, and subsequently reigned under this name.

In England after the Reformation, the practice of adopting a new name at confirmation was still used, as Sir Edward Coke wrote that a man might validly buy land by his &quot;confirmation name&quot;, and he recalled the case of a Sir Francis Gawdye, late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, whose name of baptism was Thomas and his name of confirmation Francis.

<text>Jet2.com Limited is a British low-cost airline based at Leeds Bradford Airport, England, United Kingdom. It offers scheduled and charter flights from the United Kingdom. As of 2022, it is the third-largest scheduled airline in the UK, behind easyJet and British Airways. Jet2 is also officially the largest tour operator in the UK after overtaking TUI in 2023.

Further bases are at Belfast–International, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Bristol, East Midlands, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London–Stansted, Manchester and Newcastle airports, with a base at London–Luton starting in April 2025. The company holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats. Jet2 also offers a charter service through its Jet2charters brand.

==History==
===Origins===
Jet2.com Limited is a subsidiary of Jet2 plc, an aviation services group. The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name Channel Express, when it was purchased by the Dart Group&#x27;s current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001, the airline also began operating passenger charter services using Boeing aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.

===Formative years===

In 2002, Channel Express established the Jet2.com brand from Leeds Bradford Airport. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to Amsterdam on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice-daily rotation with two Boeing 737–300 aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.

In 2004, a second base was opened at Manchester Airport with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at Belfast International Airport. In 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at Newcastle upon Tyne. Later that year, the company acquired two Boeing 757–200 aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at Blackpool and Edinburgh. In 2006, the company relocated from Bournemouth to Leeds and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.

=== Expansion ===
In November 2008, Jet2.com changed its slogan from &quot;The North&#x27;s Low Cost Airline&quot; to &quot;Friendly Low Fares&quot;. This preceded the announcement of opening a hub at East Midlands Airport, the first of the airline&#x27;s hubs outside the North of England and Scotland. The base at East Midlands Airport opened in May 2010.

During November and December 2008, the airline operated four direct flights from Leeds Bradford to Newark Liberty International Airport using Boeing 757-200s, with a series of flights also planned from both Leeds Bradford and Newcastle during December 2010. Once again, Jet2.com re-introduced seasonal Christmas flights to New York during the 2012 winter season, however, this time, flights would operate from Glasgow, East Midlands and Newcastle, in addition to Leeds. The seasonal flights to New York continued annually until 2019 and ran from five of its UK bases. As an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the airline cancelled their seasonal trips which they have not returned as of today. It is possible that they will never return as the airline is slowly retiring their Boeing 757 aircraft which were formerly used to run those trips, and the non-LR variant of the Airbus A321neo replacing the Boeing 757 does not have enough range to cover those trips.

In 2010, the airline announced an eighth base at Glasgow Airport would be opened in April 2011, with an initial nine routes. The base was opened on 31 March, slightly earlier than scheduled. In January 2011, the airline introduced second-hand Boeing 737–800 aircraft into its fleet. This provided aircraft larger than its existing 737-300s yet smaller than its 757-200 aircraft.

Jet2.com carried over 600,000 passengers in its first year of operation and over nine million passengers during 2017; its highest recorded total.

On 17 September 2016, the airline received its first brand new Boeing 737–800 of the order for thirty made in 2015. In November 2016, Jet2.com opened its new maintenance hangar at Manchester Airport. In December 2016, Jet2.com announced that it had ordered a further four Boeing 737–800 aircraft, bringing the total on order to 34. The airline further expanded by opening its eighth and ninth UK bases in March 2017 at Birmingham and London Stansted airports, the latter being its first in the southeast of England. These have since expanded significantly to become the airline&#x27;s largest UK bases after Manchester.

=== Recent years ===
In 2019, Jet2.com received delivery of its 34th new Boeing 737–800 aircraft, taking its permanent and leased fleet size to more than 100 aircraft. Also, in 2019, Jet2.com carried a record 14.39 million passengers on 82,931 flights. This was an increase of over 18% over the year before.

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s impact on aviation, Jet2.com announced they were suspending flight operations until at least 15 July 2020. The airline continued to operate repatriation flights for British citizens overseas. On 17 August 2020, Jet2 announced via BALPA that they would be laying off 102 pilots from various UK bases due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 November 2020, Jet2.com and Jet2holidays announced that they would open their tenth United Kingdom base at Bristol Airport on 1 July 2021, operating to 33 destinations.

In August 2021, Jet2.com announced an order for 36 Airbus A321neo aircraft, plus 24 options, totalling an order for 60 planes. Although Jet2 has operated a small number of Airbus jets on lease to cope with summer demand, this is Airbus&#x27; first direct order from Jet2, and a clear shift away from the company&#x27;s traditionally all-Boeing fleet.

Jet2.com celebrated its 20th birthday on 12 February 2023. On the same day, it was revealed that Jet2holidays had become the UK&#x27;s largest tour operator with an ATOL license to carry 5.8m passengers, surpassing TUI&#x27;s 5.3m. On 16 May 2023, Jet2 announced they were opening their eleventh UK base at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In June 2023, Jet2 have announced an expansion to their 2024 summer season, with some destinations being made available from earlier months, and extra capacity for other destinations. This is to meet customer and travel agent demands. This includes additional services to Spain, Turkey, Italy and Greece destinations across all of their bases. In July 2023, Jet2 announced that its Chairman Philip Meeson was stepping down. Robin Terrell took over as chairman in September 2023. Robin joined Jet2 as a non-executive director in April 2020. Meeson has now moved to the position of founder and advisor to the board.

On 26 March 2024, Jet2.com announced they would open their twelfth United Kingdom base at Bournemouth Airport on 1 April 2025, operating to 16 destinations. On 28 March 2024, Jet2 launched its first flight from Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Tenerife, marking the start of its new services to 20 different holiday destinations with plans for further expansion in summer 2025. On 12 July 2024, Jet2.com announced that they were bringing forward the launch of their operations from Bournemouth Airport to 4 February 2025, due to high demand with their first flight operating to Tenerife. On 13 November 2024, Jet2.com announced they would be opening up a thirteenth UK base at London Luton Airport, basing two Airbus A321neos flying to 17 destinations from April 2025.

Jet2.com&#x27;s registered office, Low Fare Finder House, is located on the grounds of Leeds Bradford International Airport. Construction of the facility broke ground in 2006, in order to accommodate pilots, cabin crew, and back of house operations. In April 2013, Jet2.com moved its Customer Contact, Finance, IT, Human Resources, Commercial and Marketing departments to a new office, &quot;Holiday House&quot;, located within the city centre of Leeds. In September 2014, the airline opened a new £9.5 million training academy at Euroway Industrial Estate in Bradford. In addition to the training centre located in Bradford, Jet2.com announced in February 2023 that they&#x27;d opened a new £8.5 million training centre in Cheadle. Both training centres will operate in parallel.
