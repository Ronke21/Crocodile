<text>In Greek mythology, Electra (; &#x27;amber&#x27;) was one of the Pleiades, the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione. She lived on the island of Samothrace. She had two sons, Dardanus and Iasion (or Eetion), by Zeus.

Electra was connected with the legend of the Palladium, the sacred statue, which became the talismanic protector of Troy. Electra, along with the rest of the Pleiades, were transformed into stars by Zeus. By some accounts she was the one star among seven of the constellation not easily seen because, since she could not bear to look upon the destruction of Troy, she hid her eyes, or turned away; or in her grief, she abandoned her sisters and became a comet.

==Family==
The Pleiades were said to be the daughters of Atlas, who was the son of the Titan Iapetos. No early source mentions their mother, but according to some late accounts she was the Oceanid Pleione. Hyginus&#x27; &quot;De astronomia&quot; says that Electra and her six sisters were called the Pleiades because, according to the 1st-century BC Greek scholar and historian Alexander Polyhistor, they were the daughters of Pleione. &quot;De astronomia&quot; also says that, according to Musaeus, their mother was instead an Oceanid named Aithra, explaining that they were called the Pleiades because there were more (&quot;pleion&quot; in Greek) of them than their sisters the Hyades. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, the Pleiades were born to Pleione &quot;at Cyllene&quot; (Mount Cyllene?) in Arcadia.

On the island of Samothrace, Electra had, by Zeus, a son Dardanus who left Samothrace and founded the city of Dardanus in the Troad. Through Dardanus, Electra was the progenitor of the Trojan royal line. She also had another son, by Zeus, Iasion (also called Eetion), who, because of an outrage against Demeter (or her statue), was blasted by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolt. The logographer Hellanicus also makes Electra the mother, by Zeus, of Harmonia the wife of Cadmus, although usually Harmonia is the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite. Nonnus also makes Electra the mother of Emathion, who succeeded his brother Dardanus as king of Samothrace.

According to an Italian tradition, Electra was the wife of the Etruscan king Corythus. Her sons Dardanus and Iasion were born in Italy, with Iasion being the son of Electra and Corythus, and Dardanus being the son of Electra and Zeus.

==Mythology==
There are two stories involving Electra. One concerns the Palladium, the sacred statue of Pallas Athena, considered to be the divine protector of Troy (and later Rome). According to Apollodorus, Electra, seeking protection from Zeus, took refuge at the divine statue, but Zeus in his anger threw the statue from heaven. It landed near Troy, where Ilus, the founder of Troy, found the statue and built a temple to house and honor it. According to another version of the story Electra herself gave the statue to Dardanus as protection for Troy.

Another story involving Electra, concerns her, and her six sisters transformation into stars. The reason for their transformation varied. According to one account, the Pleiades were being pursued by the huntsman Orion, intent on rape, but Zeus took pity on the sisters and placed them among the stars. And by way of explanation for the fact that only six of the seven stars in the constellation were readily visible, it was said that Electra, unable to behold the destruction of Troy, hid her eyes, or turned away; or, in another version, Electra, in mourning, let down her hair, and left her sisters altogether and became a &quot;long haired star&quot; (i.e. a &quot;comet&quot;).

==Sources==
===Early===
A constellation called the Pleiades is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; and Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, however none of the stars are named. Hesiod calls the stars the &quot;Atlageneis&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;born from Atlas&quot;, although linguistic considerations suggests that the epithet refers to some geographic location. The lyric poet Simonides of Ceos (c. 556–468 BC), is the first (datable) source to connect the name of the star-cluster with the seven daughters of Atlas.

The names of the seven Pleiades are first attested in a scholion on Pindar, which quotes three hexameter lines from an unattributed poem, probably from the Hesiodic corpus:
:lovely Taygete and dark-eyed Electra,
:Alcyone and Asterope and godly Celaeno,
:Maia and Merope, whom splendid Atlas begot.

Electra is also mentioned in the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, where apparently she was said to be the mother of Dardanus and Eetion. The fifth-century Greek logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos provides more details. According to Hellanicus, Electra (called Electryone by Hellanicus) lived on Samothrace, where the locals called her Strategis. She had two sons by Zeus, Dardanus, and Eetion, who was also called Iasion. She also had a daughter Harmonia by Zeus, who was the bride of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes, and that because of this, the Thebans named one of the city gates (the Electran gates) after her.

The story of Electra and her sisters being transformed into stars may also have been told somewhere in the Epic Cycle. A scholion to the &quot;Iliad&quot; mentions the Pleiades escape from Orion by catasterism and says the following about Electra:
:They say that Electra, being unwilling to watch the sack of Ilion [i.e. Troy] because it was a foundation of her descendants, left the place where she had been set as a star, so that whereas they had previously been seven, they became six. The story is found in the Cyclic poets.

===Late===
&quot;De astronomia&quot; is a Latin astronomical guide, attributed to Hyginus (died AD 17), containing the most complete surviving ancient compendium of astral mythology. It gives the following account of why only six of the seven Pleiades can be seen:
:The Pleiades are said to be seven in number, but no one can see more than six of them. It has been suggested by way of explanation that, of the seven, six went to bed with immortals—while the other is indicated to have been the wife of Sisyphos. ... She [Merope] was placed among the stars thanks to her other sisters, but because she married a mortal, her star is faint.
:According to other accounts, it is Electra who cannot be seen, for the following reason. The Pleiades led the chorus of the stars, so it is thought, but after the fall of Troy and the destruction of all who ere descended from her through Dardanos, Electra was overcome by grief and abandoned the company of her sisters to establish herself on the circle known as the arctic, and at long intervals she can be seen in mourning with her hair unloosed; for that reason she has come to be called a comet (long-haired star).

The Latin poet Ovid, in his poem the &quot;Fasti&quot; (c. AD 8), gives a similar account, but with a different explanation regarding Electra:

:Seven are they [the Pleiades] usually called, but six they usually are; whether it be that six of the sisters were embraced by gods (for they say that Sterope lay with Mars, Alcyone and fair Celaeno with Neptune, and Maia, Electra, and Taygete with Jupiter); the seventh, Merope, was married to a mortal man, to Sisyphus, and she repents of it, and from shame at the deed she alone of the sisters hides herself; or whether it be that Electra could not brook to behold the fall of Troy, and so covered her eyes with her hand.

The mythographer Apollodorus (first or second century AD), discussing the &quot;legend&quot; of the Palladium&quot;, says that &quot;Electra, at the time of her violation, took refuge at the image, and Zeus threw the Palladium along with Ate into the Ilian country; and Ilus built a temple for it, and honored it.&quot;

Nonnus, in the third book of his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; (c. fifth century AD), has the wandering Cadmus land on Samothrace where he will find his bride to be, Electra&#x27;s foster-daughter Harmonia. He arrives at the palace, &quot;that masterly work of Hephaistos, which the industrious god once built for Electra as a bride&quot;, where he is received by Electra, the queen of Samothrace, and her son Emathion, who, with the departure of his brother Dardanus, is now &quot;sole king&quot;. In answer to Electra&#x27;s questioning, Cadmus tells her of the woeful abduction of his sister Europa, by Zeus, and order of his father Agenor to find his sister or never return home. Nonnus has Electra try to console Cadmus with the following speech:
:&quot;My guest, let sister and country and father pass into the whirlpool of Forgetfulness and un-remembering silence! For this is the way men&#x27;s life runs on, bringing trouble upon trouble; since all that are born of mortal womb are slaves by necessity to Fate the Spinner. I am witness, queen though I am, if I was ever born myself one of those Pleiads, seven girls whom our mother once carried under her heart in labour, seven times having called Eileithyia at her lying-in to lighten the pangs of birth after birth—I am witness! for my house is far from my father&#x27;s; no Sterope is near me, no Maia my companion, nor sister Celaino beside me at my hearth; I have not dandled up and down sister Taygete&#x27;s Lacedaimon at my breast nor held the merry boy on my cherishing arm; I do not see Alcyone&#x27;s house hard by, or hear Merope herself speak some heartwarming word! Here is something besides which I lament even more—in the bloom of his youth my own son has left his home, just when the down was on his cheek, my Dardanos has gone abroad to the bosom of the Idaian land; he has given the firstling crop of his hair to Phrygian Simoeis, and drunk the alien water of river Thymbrios. And away by the boundary of Libya my father still suffers hardship, old Atlas with chafing shoulders bowed, upholding the seven-zoned vault of the sky.
:&quot;Still and all with these great sufferings I feed a comfortable hope, by the promises of Zeus, that with my other sisters I shall pass from the earth to the stars&#x27; Atlantean vault, and dwell in heaven myself a star with my sisters six.

<doc id="852601" wikidata="Q4701277" url="?curid=852601" title="Luri language">
<text>Luri (, ) is a Southwestern Iranian language continuum spoken by the Lurs, an Iranian people native to West Asia. The Luri dialects are descended from Middle Persian and are Central Luri, Bakhtiari, and Southern Luri. This language is spoken mainly by the Bakhtiari and the Northern and Southern Lurs (Lorestan, Ilam, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Mamasani, Sepidan, Bandar Ganaveh, Bandar Deylam) in Iran.

==History==
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; calls Luri “an aberrant form of archaic Persian.” The language descends from either Middle Persian or Old Persian. It belongs to the “&quot;Perside&quot; southern Zagros group” (as opposed to Kurdish dialects of northern Zagros), and is lexically similar to modern Persian, differing mainly in phonology.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, &quot;All Lori dialects closely resemble standard Persian and probably developed from a stage of Persian similar to that represented in Early New Persian texts written in Perso-Arabic script. The sole typical Lori feature not known in early New Persian or derivable from it is the inchoative marker (see below), though even this is found in Judeo-Persian texts&quot;. The Bakhtiāri dialect may be closer to Persian. There are two distinct languages, Greater Luri (&quot;Lor-e bozorg&quot;), Southern Luri (including Bakhtiari dialect), and Lesser Luri (&quot;Lor-e kuček&quot;), Northern Luri.

==Geography==
=== Northern Luri ===
Luri dialects (Northern Luri [or Central Luri], Shuhani and Hinimini) are as a group the second largest language in the Lorestan province (around of the population), mainly spoken in the eastern counties of the province (Khoramabad, Dorud, Borujerd). In the Ilam province (around of the population) it is mostly spoken in villages in the southern parts of the province. Around of Hamadan province speak Northern Luri.

===Southern Luri===
Southern Luri is a dialect of Luri is spoken by Southern Lurs and Lurs people mainly in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, northwest Fars province, east Khuzestan province and some in Bushehr province.

=== Bakhtiari ===

The Bakhtiari dialect is the main first language in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari (around ), except around Shahrekord, Borujen, Ben and Saman counties, where Persian, Turkic and Chaharmahali dialect predominate. Around of Isfahan province speak Bakhtiari.

=== Statistics ===
==Internal classification==
The language consists of Central Luri, Bakhtiari, and Southern Luri. Central Luri is spoken in northern parts of Luri communities including eastern, central and northern parts of Luristan province, southern parts of Hamadan province mainly in Malayer, Nahavand and Tuyserkan counties, southern regions of Ilam province and southeastern parts of Markazi province. Bakhtiari is used by Bakhtiari people in South Luristan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, significant regions in north and east of Khouzestan and western regions of Isfahan province. Finally, Southern Luri is spoken throughout Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, and in western and central regions in Fars province, northern and western parts of Bushehr province and southeastern regions of Khouzestan. Several Luri communities are spread sporadically across the Iranian Plateau e.g. Khorasan (Beyranvand and Bakhtiari Luri descendants), Kerman, Guilan and Tehran provinces.

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===

# // may also range to a higher // in the Northern dialect.

* Vowels /, / may also be realized as more close [, ] within diphthongs or before glide sounds.
* /, / can also be heard as higher [] in Southern Luri.
* // can also be raised as [] or [] before semivowels.

=== Consonants ===
# // occurs in Northern Luri.
# Velar fricatives /, / as equivalent to uvular fricatives /, /, occur in Northern Luri.
# // occurs in Southern Luri.
# // occurs in Northern Luri, as well as in words borrowed from Persian.
# // can also be heard as a trill [] in Southern Luri.

* // also occurs as a glide to elongate short vowels (e.g. /oh/; ). 
* [, ] occur as allophones of a labiodental approximant //.

==Vocabulary==
In comparison with other Iranian languages, Luri has been less affected by foreign languages such as Arabic and Turkic. Nowadays, many ancient Iranian language characteristics are preserved and can be observed in Luri grammar and vocabulary. According to diverse regional and socio-ecological conditions and due to longtime social interrelations with adjacent ethnic groups especially Kurds and Persians, different dialects of Luri, despite mainly common characteristics, have significant differences. The northern dialect tends to have more Kurdish loanwords inside and southern dialects (Bakhtiari and Southern Luri) have been more exposed to Persian loanwords.

<text>The College of Navarre (, ) was one of the colleges of the historic University of Paris. It rivaled the Sorbonne and was renowned for its library.

==History==
The college was founded by Queen Joan I of Navarre in 1305, who provided for three departments, the arts with 20 students, philosophy with 30 and theology with 20 students.

The queen bequeathed part of her fine &quot;hôtel de Navarre&quot; in rue Saint André des Arts, together with lands generated rents of 2000 &quot;livres&quot; p.a. in her counties of Champagne and Brie. Her trustees decided to sell the Paris property and acquire an ample plot on the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève (rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviève / rue Descartes), right in the Latin Quarter, and build the college anew. The first stone, laid 12 April 1309, was for the college chapel.

Provision was made also for the scholars&#x27; support, 4 Paris sous weekly for the artists, 6 for the logicians and 8 for the theologians. These allowances were to continue until the graduates held benefices of the value respectively of 30, 40 and 60 &quot;livres&quot;. The regulations allowed the theological students a fire, daily, from November to March after dinner and supper for one half-hour. The luxury of benches was forbidden by a commission appointed by Urban V in 1366. On the festival days, the theologians were expected to deliver a collation to their fellow-students of the three classes. The rector at the head of the college, originally appointed by the faculty of the university, was now appointed by the king&#x27;s confessor. The students wore a special dress and the tonsure and ate in common.

Classes bore little resemblance to today&#x27;s universities. Subjects were included that are not taught today, such as rhetoric in its classical meaning. The students were required to speak and write only in Latin and all subjects had to be learned by rote. Only after graduation were students allowed to write using their own words or discuss the subjects. At least one of the rectors, Claude D&#x27;Espence became rector before he obtained his doctorate.

The College was dissolved at the time of the French Revolution, its library dispersed and its archives lost. Its buildings were assigned to the École polytechnique by Napoleon in 1805.

<text>John Farey Sr. (24 September 1766 – 6 January 1826) was an English geologist and writer best known for Farey sequence, a mathematical construct that is named after him.

==Biography==
=== Youth and early career ===
Farey was born on 24 September 1766 at Woburn in Bedfordshire to John Farey (1728–1798) and his second wife, Rachel (&quot;née&quot; Wright) (1732–1804), a Wesleyan Methodist. He was educated at Halifax in Yorkshire, and showed such aptitude in mathematics, drawing and surveying, that he was brought under the notice of John Smeaton (1724–1792).

After his education he moved to London, where he had relatives, and worked there for a number of years, during which time he met and married, Sophia Hubert (1770–1830). While in London they had their first child John Farey Jr. They went on to have eight more children, two of whom died in infancy. One of his children, Marianne Farey, was the mother of Sophie Gengembre Anderson, the noted artist.

=== Land agent in Woburn and consulting surveyor in London ===
In 1792, Farey was appointed surveyor and land agent to Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford for his Woburn estates. After the death of the duke, Farey in 1802 moved to London, and, after first contemplating emigrating or taking a farm in the country, he settled there as a consulting surveyor and geologist.

That he was enabled to take this step was due largely to his acquaintance with the geologist William Smith, who in 1801 had been employed by the duke of Bedford in works of draining and irrigation. The duke, appreciating Smith&#x27;s knowledge of the strata, commissioned him in 1802 to explore the margin of the chalk-hills south of Woburn in order to determine the true succession of the strata; and he instructed Farey to accompany him. Farey has remarked that Smith was his Master and Instructor in Mineral Surveying, and his subsequent publications show how well he had profited by the teachings he received.

In 1805, he succeeded the agriculturist Arthur Young as Secretary of the Smithfield Club. His surveying work took him all over the country and he was in much demand from landowners wishing to improve their estates, or exploit the minerals they held. His work on economic geology then was of importance in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution by locating new resources of coal and metal ores.

== Work ==
=== Writings ===
Farey was a prolific writer, and Professor Hugh Torrens (see references below) has traced around 270 papers by him, quadrupling the number given by the Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Scientific Papers&quot;. He wrote on all manner of subjects, ranging from horticulture, geology, meteorology, metrology, currency decimalisation, music and mathematics to pacifism.

He was an important contributor to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; with articles on canals, mineralogy, surveying and a number of the scientific and mathematical basis of sound. His Canals article is the largest in the work, being some 210,000 words. He contributed similarly to the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopedia&quot;. Various nineteenth-century biographical sources, including the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, claimed wrongly that he wrote the Rees article on Steam. It was actually written by his son John Farey Jr.

He contributed articles on music to periodicals, as well as around 350 articles on the topic for two encyclopaedias. They concerned the mathematical relationship of note values and musical temperament. He devised a notation which allowed a sound to be expressed by the sum of three small values Σ + &quot;f&quot; + &quot;m&quot;. He made great use of the researches of Marmaduke Overend (music theorist and organist) (c1730-1790), whose manuscripts were then in the library of the Royal Institution.

In 1809, Farey met William Martin who had published work on Derbyshire fossils, to investigate whether they could create a joint geological map of Derbyshire. Martin however was too ill to meet a second time and he died the following year.

Farey&#x27;s best known work is &quot;General View of the Agriculture and Minerals of Derbyshire&quot; (3 volumes 1811–17) for the Board of Agriculture. In the first of these volumes (1811) he gave an account of the upper part of the British series of strata, and an exposition of the Carboniferous and other strata of Derbyshire. In this work, and in a paper published in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, vol. 51, 1818, p. 173, on &#x27;Mr Smith&#x27;s Geological Claims stated&#x27;, he called attention to the importance of the discoveries of William Smith.

===Farey sequence===

As well as being remembered by historians of geology, his name is more widely known by the Farey sequence which he noted as a result of his interest in the mathematics of sound (&quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, vol. 47, 1816, pp. 385–386).

Farey died in London. Subsequently, Sophia, his widow, offered his geological collection to the British Museum. The museum rejected the collection, and it was dispersed and broken up.

<text>Boring is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. It is located along Oregon Route 212 in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range, approximately southeast of downtown Portland, and northeast of Oregon City. A bedroom community, Boring is named after William Harrison Boring, a Union soldier and pioneer whose family built a farm in the area in 1856, before Oregon had received statehood.

The community was officially platted in 1903 after the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company constructed an electric rail line, which operated from Portland to Cazadero. The former railway is now part of the Springwater Corridor, a rail trail which begins in Boring and ends at the Eastbank Esplanade along the Willamette River in southeast Portland. The Boring Lava Field, an extinct volcanic field zone that comprises terrain extending from Boring to downtown Portland, took its name from the community.

Boring was a hub of the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest prior to and during World War I due to the abundance of surrounding temperate coniferous and evergreen forests, as well as its proximity to the Port of Portland. In addition to logging, plant nurseries and agriculture have also historically been major economic forces in Boring.

Boring has often been included in lists of places with unusual names. In 2012, Boring was named a sister city of the village of Dull, Scotland, and later joined Bland, Australia, in the &quot;Trinity of Tedium.&quot;

==History==
===Timeline===
The land on which Boring was built was a former lava field. The Boring Lava Field, which takes its namesake from the community, is located just north of Boring. There are approximately 80 lava vents across the area, remnants of the volcanic activity that occurred there roughly 2.6 million years ago. The lava field extends across surrounding Portland and Vancouver, Washington, though the volcanic centers are extinct. The land that would later become Boring had no known inhabitants, though the Clackamas Tribe had a camp located south of Boring, near present-day Oregon City, along the Willamette River. By 1855, the remaining members of the tribe had relocated to the Grand Ronde. Settlers began to arrive in the Oregon Territory in mid-1800s via the Oregon Trail, after the establishment of Portland.
Boring takes its name after William Harrison Boring, an Illinois native and early resident who began farming there in 1874, and subsequently donated land for the community&#x27;s first schoolhouse to be built. He was a Union veteran who had moved to Oregon after having fought in the Siege of Vicksburg during the Civil War. William&#x27;s half-brother, Joseph, had settled in the area in 1856 prior to his arrival.

Boring was platted in 1903 as &quot;Boring Junction&quot; after the construction of a railway line by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company. The post office was established and named Boring the same year, which builders of an interurban railway adopted as the name of the community. An electric trolley operated on the railroad line from Portland through Gresham and Boring, ending in Cazadero, which began transporting passengers in 1905. The trolley significantly reduced travel time between Portland and the communities to its east: Horse and buggy travel from Boring to Portland took an average of six hours, while a trip to Portland via the trolley system took only one hour. Though younger students in the area attended a local school built on Richey Road, high school students in Boring commuted via trolley to Gresham and Portland to attend high schools there. The early residents of the area post-settlement were mainly German and Swedish immigrants.

After World War II and the prominence of automobile ownership, the trolley ceased passenger operations to Portland, but continued to travel between Boring and Gresham. The railway went defunct in the following years, and was incorporated as part of the Springwater Corridor, a rail trail that begins in Boring and ends at the Eastbank Esplanade in downtown Portland.

In 2005, citizens of Boring applied to become one of the first legally recognized villages in Oregon. However, after many months of polarizing debate on the village issue, residents narrowly defeated the village designation in a town hall referendum in August 2006, with 293 votes in favor and 298 against.

===Name and municipality pairings===

The unusual name of the community often prompts its inclusion on lists of unusual place names. The name &quot;Boring&quot; is embraced by locals, however, and found in many local businesses, resulting in many road signs that seem humorous to outsiders. Boosters of the village designation use the slogan &quot;The most exciting place to live.&quot;

In 2011, Elizabeth Leighton of Aberfeldy, Scotland, proposed the community&#x27;s pairing with the village of Dull, Scotland, after passing through Boring on a cycling holiday. In June 2012, Boring accepted the proposal of Dull to &quot;pair&quot; their municipalities, in an effort to promote tourism in both places as a play on their names. Dull is a village of only 84 residents, while Boring has about 8,000.

In 2013, the farm community and former gold prospecting site Bland Shire in West Wyalong, New South Wales, Australia was added to the mix to create not a &quot;twinned town&quot; relationship but a &quot;League of Extraordinary Communities&quot; grouping Dull, Boring, and Bland as a means of encouraging travel, promoting all three communities. The same year, construction of the Boring Station Trailhead Park was completed on the empty lot that once housed the original 1903 train station, and opened to the public. The Boring Community Planning Organization also issued commemorative &quot;Boring &amp; Dull: a pair for the ages&quot; T-shirts and mugs, as well as raffling off a trip to Dull.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Located at the northernmost end of the eastern Willamette Valley, Boring rests in the foothills of the Cascade mountain range, at the base of Mount Hood. The community is approximately from Government Camp, a major resort and skiing community on Mount Hood. The community comprises approximately of Clackamas County. Boring is considered part of the Portland metropolitan area, located approximately southeast of the Portland city limits, and from downtown Portland.

Boring&#x27;s landscape is hilly, with its elevation ranging between and . Several creeks run west through the community limits into the Clackamas River, including Doane Creek, North Fork Deep Creek, and Tickle Creek.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Boring has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The community receives an annual average of of rain—significantly more than neighboring Portland, which averages , or Gresham, which averages . Boring&#x27;s high volume of rainfall can be attributed to its location in the Cascade foothills, which situates it at a considerably higher elevation than other towns and cities in the Portland metropolitan area. The first frost in Boring typically occurs within the first week of November, while the last is typically in the first week of April.

====Annual data====
==Economy==

After its inception as a railroad community, Boring evolved into a hub for the timber industry in the Northwest, beginning in the pre-World War I era and continuing throughout much of the 20th century. One of the first mills established in Boring was the Hillyard Sawmill, which began operations in the 1890s; the mill produced over of lumber per day, mostly consisting of railroad ties. Bert Jonsrud, an early resident of the area, would later establish the Jonsrud Bros. Lumber Company, which would become Boring&#x27;s main lumber mill. In a 1915 survey of timber and logging camps in the Pacific Northwest, it was reported that Jonsrud mill was producing of lumber per day. Today, Vanport International is the main lumber company operating out of Boring. Although their main business is lumber export, they are co-located with a lumber mill actively processing timber products.

The Portland Traction Company, a now-defunct railroad, operated a rail line from Portland (near the current location of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) on the Willamette River) to Boring via Gresham. In the 1950s, the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads jointly took over operation of the remaining portion of the line for freight operations. Much of the line has since been purchased by local governments for the creation of a long-distance rail trail named the Springwater Corridor.

The community is also home to a large number of dairy farms, plant nurseries and berry farms, including Iseli Nursery and Liepold Farms, who supplies produce to the local restaurant chain Burgerville. There are over thirty active plant and tree nurseries that operate within the community. Another Boring community staple, Mt. Hood Center, was built in Boring in 1974 and the facility is still functioning today as an equestrian center, event venue, and an equine-based schooling alternative, Mt. Hood Center Academy. Boring is also home of a campus of Guide Dogs For The Blind, Inc., the oldest guide dog training program on the US West Coast. The largest employer in Boring as of 2018 is Good Shepherd Community Church, an independent Evangelical church.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 U.S. census, the ZCTA for Boring&#x27;s ZIP code had a population of 7,726 in 2,875 households. This was a significant drop from the 2000 census, which had reported a population of 12,851. Males made up 50.50% of the population, while females made up 49.50%. According to this data, the population&#x27;s ethnic profile was 77.3% white, 13.3% Hispanic or Latino, 2.6% Asian, .3% African American, and 4% two or more races.

32.20% of households in the ZCTA earned under $50,000 annually, while 39.80% earned between $50,000–$100,000, and 28% had reported earnings exceeding $100,000. As of 2018, the unemployment rate was 3.98%. 86.8% of residents were property owners, while 13.2% were renters. In 2015, Boring was ranked among the wealthiest ZIP codes in the Portland metropolitan area.

==Law and government==
Along with other unincorporated communities in Clackamas County, Boring is served by Metro, a regional government of the Portland metropolitan area, and the only metropolitan planning organization in the United States. The community is located within Oregon&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, represented by Earl Blumenauer.

In 2015, Steve Bates, the former chair of the Boring planning council received over 700 signatures in favor of having the community removed from the Metro jurisdiction, due to the fact that Metro&#x27;s regional boundary only includes the western half of the community, where Boring&#x27;s downtown area lies. Metro responded by noting that Boring lies outside of their urban growth boundary, and that the jurisdictional boundary had no bearing on any foreseeable incorporation of Boring.
According to the Clackamas County voting data from the 2012 U.S. general election, Boring somewhat favored the Republican party, which accounted for 59% of votes, while 37% favored the Democratic party. Other parties accounted for 4% of votes. In the 2008 U.S. general election, the Republican party was only slightly favored at 51%, with the Democratic party at 47%, and 2% accounting for other parties.

==Education==

The first schoolhouse in Boring was the Fern Hill School, built in 1883. The Kelso Schoolhouse opened two years later, in 1885. Another four-room school house called Oregonia was built in 1904. A play shed was added to the school in 1918.

Contemporarily, the community is served by the Oregon Trail and the Gresham-Barlow school districts as the community straddles the boundary between the two. Elementary schools in Boring include Naas Elementary and Kelso Elementary. Secondary schools serving Boring include Boring Middle School, Sandy High School (Oregon Trail), and Sam Barlow High School (Gresham-Barlow). Private schools in the area include Good Shepherd School and Hoodview Adventist School.

Boring is also home to Oregon Trail Academy, the only public K-12 single campus International Baccalaureate school in the Northwest. The school was established as a charter school in 2010 by the Oregon Trail School District and also serves students from Gresham-Barlow. In 2019, the school ranked in the top 15 schools in the Portland metro area and 17th in the state.

Students&#x27; test score performance in the public school system in Boring ranks at or above the national average in both elementary and middle school(s).

==Infrastructure==
Oregon Route 212 begins in Boring, and runs through the center of the downtown area. Its roads are maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation.

From the 1970s until the end of 2012, Boring was within the TriMet transit district, the Portland metropolitan area&#x27;s mass transit system, and was served by bus line 84, albeit with only a single round trip in each peak period. In 2011, business owners in Boring petitioned the transit district&#x27;s board to remove Boring from the district, arguing that Boring was receiving too little bus service relative to the amount being paid in employer-payroll taxes. The petition was approved, to take effect at the beginning of 2013, bringing an end to TriMet service in Boring.

The Springwater Corridor, a rail trail that was originally a railroad running between Boring and Portland, begins in Boring next to Boring Middle School, and is used for running, walking, and cycling. The trail ends at the Eastbank Esplanade in downtown Portland.

==In popular culture==
The eponymous fictional town of the Disney TV series &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; is inspired by Boring.

In 2017, it was reported that ABC had developed a &quot;serial killer comedy&quot; series titled &quot;Boring, OR&quot; about a small town under siege by a serial murderer. The series is being produced by Jack Black.

In 2013, the community was home to an event hosted by Vitaminwater, in a series in which the company gave Boring and the town of Normal, Illinois, &quot;makeovers&quot;. The event featured musical performances by Santigold, Matt &amp; Kim, and Yung Skeeter, as well as standup comedy performances which included Amy Schumer. Boring was the subject of a 2016 promotional documentary short by Brooklyn, New York-based cinematographer Adam McDaid for Ogilvy &amp; Mather.

In 2018, the Netflix web television series &quot;Everything Sucks!&quot; is set in the town and focuses on students attending the fictional &quot;Boring High School.&quot;

<text>Sir James Albert Manning Aikins (December 10, 1851 – March 1, 1929) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was the leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party in the provincial election of 1915, and later served as the province&#x27;s ninth Lieutenant Governor.

Aikins was born in Grahamsville, Toronto Gore Township, Peel County, Canada West (now Mississauga, Ontario) and educated at Toronto&#x27;s Upper Canada College. His father, James Cox Aikins, was a prominent Canadian politician, serving as a cabinet minister from 1869 to 1873 and 1878 to 1882, and serving as Manitoba&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governor between 1882 and 1888.

The younger Aikins was educated at Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto, receiving his B.A. in 1875. He subsequently moved to Winnipeg with his father, and remained in the western city after the elder Aikins returned to Ontario.

From 1879 to 1896, Aikins was counsel with the federal Department of Justice. In 1880, he was part of a committee that investigated the administration of justice in the North-West Territories. Aikins was appointed counsel to the Manitoba government in 1900, and was responsible for drafting the &quot;Temperance Act&quot; passed by the government of Hugh John Macdonald. He also served as president of the Law Society of Manitoba, and was a solicitor for the Canadian Pacific Railway from 1881 to 1911.

In the 1911 federal election, Aikins was elected as a Conservative candidate to the House of Commons of Canada, for the riding of Brandon. The Conservative Party won this election, and Aikins served as a backbench supporter of Robert Borden&#x27;s administration.

Aikins left federal politics in 1915, amid unexpected circumstances. The provincial Conservative government of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in May 1915. Aikins served as chair of the provincial party&#x27;s convention in July, and accepted the position of party leader on July 15 when no other candidates came forward. He resigned his federal seat, and led the provincial party into a new election.

The new Liberal government of Tobias Norris was extremely popular, and portrayed Aikins as the tool of more sinister figures in the Conservative Party. The Liberals won 40 seats in the election, against only five for the Tories. Aikins was resoundingly defeated in Brandon City.

The following year, Aikins was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba on the recommendation of Prime Minister Robert Borden. He served in this largely ceremonial position from August 5, 1916, to October 25, 1926. Although his initial appointment was greeted with skepticism, Aikins proved to be a popular office-holder. Even the pro-Liberal &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; approved of the continuance of his appointment on the recommendation of Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in 1921.

Aikins gave the Norris government permission to continue in office for a few weeks after losing a vote of confidence in 1922, such that important legislation could be passed before the next election.

Aikins was the first president of the Canadian Bar Association, holding that office for 13 years. He was the first of five lawyers from the Aikins firm to serve as president of the CBA, the others being his son Gordon Harold Aikins (1942–1943), John MacAulay (1953–1954), A. Lorne Campbell (1970–1971), and Guy Joubert (2008-2009).

Aikins died on March 1, 1929.

<text>High Bridge is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Jessamine County, Kentucky, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 242. It lies along the lower reaches of the Kentucky River across from the confluence of the Dix River with the Kentucky. The community is part of the Lexington–Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
A post office was established in 1879 in the community then known as &quot;North Tower&quot;. In 1888, the town was renamed for the landmark High Bridge, a railroad bridge over the Kentucky River. The first bridge was planned by John Roebling as a suspension bridge, but ultimately built as a cantilever bridge. The current bridge, the second one on these foundations, is the highest railroad bridge in the United States over a navigable river. The Kentucky River runs through the Kentucky River Palisades for much of the lower portion of its length. Most of the bridges over it in the area are relatively high ones.

High Bridge was opened in 1876 and was the first cantilever bridge in North America. Standing over the river between the Palisades, it first carried both passenger and freight trains. The American Society of Civil Engineers has designated it a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The 1876 bridge was replaced in 1911 by a more robust bridge in the same place. This is the current bridge, which stands above the river. Freight trains of the Norfolk Southern Railway still use this bridge several times a day.

The Palisades were a popular spot for picnics and dances, as breezes from the river gorge kept it comfortable. An open-air roofed ballroom was built there for community dances and has been preserved. A small playground and park adjoin the Palisades property.

A brand of bottled water named for the community depicts the bridge on its label. Highbridge Springs water is well known to the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The Wildcat mascot is used on the bottle label to show support for the team. The bottle name is &quot;Swish&quot;.

Bethel Academy, the first Methodist school west of the Appalachians, was established in the High Bridge vicinity in 1790.

==Geography==
The High Bridge census-designated place consists of the community of High Bridge as well as rural land comprising the inside of the bend on the Kentucky River where the bridge is located. Kentucky Route 29 leads northeast from High Bridge to Wilmore, and Nicholasville, the Jessamine county seat, is northeast of High Bridge.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the High Bridge CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.36%, are water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, there were 268 people, 120 housing units, and 51 families in the CDP. The racial makeup was 93.0% White, 0.3% Asian, 0.7% from some other race, and 6.0% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 4.1% of the population.

The ancestry of the CDP was 79.3% American, 3.4% Irish, and 2.3% German.

The median age was 59.2 years old. The average family size was 1.97 people per household. The median household income was $30,750. 17.2% of the population were in poverty.

<text>Sidney Davidoff (born July 18, 1939) is an American lawyer who was one of 20 people on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

==Life and career==
Born in Brooklyn, New York, Davidoff graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from City College of New York in 1960 and earned his J.D. from New York University in 1963. He was admitted to the New York Bar that year.

Davidoff was administrative assistant to New York Mayor John Lindsay for seven years. Hendrik Hertzberg called him &quot;the Mayor&#x27;s burly troubleshooter&quot;.

He served as President of The New York Young Republican Club from 1967 to 1968.

In 1968, when students took over Hamilton Hall at Columbia University and held dean Henry S. Coleman captive, Lindsay sent Davidoff as one of the mediators to broker the dean&#x27;s release. He likely caught the attention of Nixon staffers following a street fracas between pro- and anti-war demonstrators, where Davidoff re-lowered the American flag to half-mast in honor of the four demonstrators killed at the Kent State shootings after opponents had raised it in defiance.

On Nixon&#x27;s list, Davidoff was described thus: &quot;Lindsay&#x27;s top personal aide: a first class S.O.B., wheeler-dealer and suspected bagman. Positive results would really shake the Lindsay camp and Lindsay&#x27;s plans to capture youth vote. Davidoff in charge.&quot;

Davidoff was a Chubb Fellow at Yale University, as well as a lecturer to the Root-Tilden students at New York University School of Law. Davidoff is currently a senior partner in the firm Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron LLP, which he founded in 1975. The firm is recognized as one of the top lobbyists in the state of New York. He later went on to form the New York Advocacy Association, a &quot;lobbying group for lobbyists,&quot; designed to counter strict and complicated lobbying laws in the State of New York. He is a member of the Metropolitan New York Board of Governors for the United States Olympic Committee.

Davidoff has also had roles in television shows, including the ABC comedy &quot;Spin City&quot;, and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

<doc id="852618" wikidata="Q4950895" url="?curid=852618" title="Bowers Fly Baby">
<text>The Bowers Fly Baby is a homebuilt, single-seat, open-cockpit, wood and fabric low-wing monoplane that was designed by famed United States aircraft designer and Boeing historian, Peter M. Bowers.

==Development==
The prototype Fly Baby first flew in 1962, becoming the winner of the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s 1962 design competition.

Variants include a biplane version called the Bowers Bi-Baby or Fly Baby 1-B, a floatplane version, and several dual-cockpit designs by various builders. Bowers also designed a side-by-side two-seat version he called Namu II, but few examples have been built.
Over 500 Fly Babies have been completed to date, with numerous still flying worldwide and an active network of builders and owners. It is built from plans and was designed to be constructed in a garage using only basic hand tools, by a person of average &quot;home handyman&quot; skill in 1962. The plans consist of over one hundred pages of typewritten instructions and dimensioned drawings. After Bowers&#x27; death in 2003 the plans were unavailable for a time. Starting in 2007 they were back on the market, sold by the Bowers family.

==Design==
To win the 1962 Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Design Contest, Bowers designed the small plane to meet EAA&#x27;s criteria for a low-cost, folding-wing airplane that was easy to build and fly, and could be towed or trailered.

The Fly Baby was designed to be a very simple aircraft. For example, the fuel gauge is a stiff wire attached to a float poking up through the gas cap (a common application in the 1930s and 1940s, as seen on Piper and Aeronca light aircraft). The structure is of aircraft-grade spruce and plywood (Bowers did not advocate skimping on the quality of structural wood), covered with doped aircraft fabric. Aileron controls are push-tube, elevator controls are a combination of push-tube and cable, the rudder is cable-controlled.

Although it is not intended for intense aerobatics, the Fly Baby can reportedly be flown through spins, simple loops, and barrel rolls.

The Fly Baby&#x27;s wings fold up against the fuselage enabling it to be stored in a single-car garage or a car trailer. The wings can be folded or unfolded in about 15 minutes. The airplane was designed to be stored in a garage and towed to the airport on its own gear. In practice, most owners use a trailer or keep their Fly Baby hangared at an airport.

The landing gear is fixed and unsprung. The main landing gear struts are made of laminated wood with a steel axle. The only shock absorption comes from the tires themselves. (Some have been modified from, the original design, to use shock-absorbing, spring-steel landing gear legs.) Hydraulic wheel brakes are usually fitted. 

The aircraft was designed to be powered by a 65-horsepower (48 kW) Continental A-65 piston engine taken from a Piper Cub. Engines of up to 100 horsepower (75 kW) have been fitted, including the Continental O-200 and converted Corvair automotive conversions.

While the instrumentation installed is up to the builder, most Fly Babys are equipped for visual flight rules (VFR) only. An electrical system is optional; many Fly Baby owners hand-prop the engine for starting, and use a handheld radio.

Some of the components used, such as the fuel tank and engine, were designed to be taken from the Piper Cub, which were cheap and plentiful in 1962. Even today, the total cost of construction can be under US$10,000.

==Variants==

;Bowers Bi-Baby
:A Fly Baby can be converted to a biplane Bi-Baby in less than one hour by adding the struts and upper wing to the existing aircraft (if the fittings were built in) or it can be built as a biplane version from the start.

==Regulations==

===United States===
In the United States of America the FAA categorizes the Fly Baby as an Experimental Amateur-Built aircraft. It also fits the FAA&#x27;s specifications for a Light Sport Aircraft and can be flown in the US by pilots holding a Recreational Pilot or Sport Pilot certificate.

===Canada===
In Canada the Fly Baby may be built as an amateur-built aircraft or as a basic ultra-light aeroplane. It may be flown with an Ultra-light Pilot Permit or higher aeroplane licence.

<text>Johann Heinrich von Mädler (29 May 1794, Berlin – 14 March 1874, Hannover) was a German astronomer.

==Life and work==
His father was a master tailor and when 12 he studied at the Friedrich‐Werdersche Gymnasium in Berlin. He was orphaned at age 19 by an outbreak of typhus, and found himself responsible for raising three younger sisters. He began giving academic lessons as a private tutor and in this way met Wilhelm Beer, a wealthy banker, in 1824.

In 1829 Beer decided to set up a private observatory in Berlin, with a 95 mm refractor telescope made by Joseph von Fraunhofer, and Mädler worked there. In 1830 they began producing drawings of Mars which later became the first true maps of that planet. They were the first to choose what is today known as Sinus Meridiani as the prime meridian for Martian maps.

They made a preliminary determination for Mars&#x27;s rotation period, which was off by almost 13 seconds. A later determination in 1837 was off by only 1.1 seconds.

They also produced the first exact map of the Moon, &quot;Mappa Selenographica&quot;, published in four volumes in 1834–1836. In 1837 a description of the Moon (&quot;Der Mond&quot;) was published. Both were the best descriptions of the Moon for many decades, not superseded until the map of Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in the 1870s. Beer and Mädler drew the firm conclusion that the features on the Moon do not change, and there is no atmosphere or water.

In 1836, Johann Franz Encke appointed Mädler an observer at the Berlin Observatory, and he observed with its 240-mm refractor. In 1840, Mädler was appointed director of the Dorpat (Tartu) Observatory in Estonia (then Russian Empire), succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Struve who had moved to Pulkovo Observatory. He carried out meteorological as well as astronomical observations. He continued Struve&#x27;s observations of double stars. He remained in Tartu until he retired in 1865, and then returned to Germany.

By examining the proper motions of stars, he came up with his &quot;Central Sun Hypothesis&quot;, according to which the center of the galaxy was located in the Pleiades star cluster and that the Sun revolves around it. He got the location wrong.

He published many scientific works, among them a two-volume &quot;History of Descriptive Astronomy&quot; in 1873. Mädlers &quot;Populäre Astronomie – Wunderbau des Weltalls&quot; (&quot;Popular Astronomy – the Miraculous Architecture of the Universe&quot;) reached out to wider audiences; an eighth edition was published in 1885.

In 1864, he proposed a calendar reform for Russia: After dropping 12 days to align with Gregorian calendar dates before the year 1900, the leap year in 1900 along with every 128th year afterwards (2028, 2156, etc.) under the Julian rules would be cancelled.

This would give a mean year of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, which is extremely close to the mean tropical year. Neither the Tsar nor Orthodox clergy accepted this unsolicited proposal, though a modified version of it was made by Sergey Glazenap in 1900, and ultimately Russia would adopt the Gregorian calendar in 1918.

The craters Mädler on the Moon and Mädler on Mars are both named in his honor.

<text>John of Ruusbroec or Jan van Ruusbroec (; 1293/1294 – 2 December 1381), sometimes modernized Ruysbroeck, was an Augustinian canon and one of the most important of the medieval mystics of the Low Countries. Some of his main literary works include &quot;The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers&quot;, &quot;The Twelve Beguines&quot;, &quot;The Spiritual Espousals&quot;, &quot;A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness&quot;, &quot;The Little Book of Enlightenment&quot;, and &quot;The Sparkling Stone&quot;. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Catholic Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.

==Life==

===Until his ordination===
John had a devout mother, who brought him up in the Catholic faith; nothing is known about his father. John&#x27;s surname, &quot;Van Ruusbroec&quot;, is not a surname in the modern sense but a toponymic that refers to his native hamlet - modern-day Ruisbroek near Brussels.

At the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and tuition of his uncle, Jan Hinckaert, a canon regular of St. Gudule&#x27;s, Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, Frank van Coudenberg. This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck&#x27;s education with a view to the priesthood. In due course, Ruysbroeck was presented with a prebend in St. Gudule&#x27;s, and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a Béguinage there, and died shortly before his ordination.

===Priest in Brussels===
From 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St. Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the Brethren of the Free Spirit were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named Heilwige Bloemardinne, was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue (Middle Dutch). Nothing of these treatises remains. The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the heretical views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country&#x27;s native language, chiefly with a view to counteract these writings which he viewed as heretical.

===Priest in Groenendaal===
The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck&#x27;s attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the hermitage of Groenendaal, in the neighbouring Sonian Forest, which was made over to them by John III, Duke of Brabant. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.
Many disciples joined the little company. It was then that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first provost, and John Ruysbroeck prior. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the cloister and there a few years later died.

This period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck&#x27;s career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of Flanders and Brabant to Holland, Germany, and France. He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. He had connections with the Friends of God in Strasbourg, and in about 1378 he was visited by Geert Groote, the founder of the Devotio Moderna. It is possible, though disputed, that John Tauler came to see him.

John died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.

==Works==
In total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.

Around 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, &quot;The Spiritual Espousals&quot;. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book&#x27;s popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as &quot;The Chastising of God&#x27;s Children&quot; (which was later printed by Wynkyn de Worde). Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, &quot;The Sparkling Stone&quot;, which was also translated into Middle English.

Ruysbroeck&#x27;s most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), &quot;The Spiritual Tabernacle&quot;, was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, &quot;The Christian Faith&quot; (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on &quot;The Four Temptations&quot;, also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck&#x27;s arrival in Groenendaal.
His later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are &quot;The Seven Enclosures&quot; (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, &quot;The Seven Rungs&quot; (c1359-60), and &quot;A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness&quot;.

Around 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, &quot;The Realm of Lovers&quot;. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work &quot;The Little Book of Enlightenment&quot;.

==Thought==
The treatise &quot;The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love&quot; is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled &quot;The Spiritual Espousals&quot;. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.

Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to wander and meditate in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he declared that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the Holy Ghost.

None of his treatises give anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his ascetic works, his favourite virtues are detachment, humility and charity; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the life of Christ, especially the passion, abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.

In common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards Christian universalism in writing that &quot;Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.&quot; But here he is careful to clarify his position: &quot;There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.&quot; Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck&#x27;s expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Geert Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, Jean Gerson and then Bossuet both professed to find traces of unconscious pantheism in his works. As an offset, the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries should be mentioned. These were by mystics and scholars such as Groote, Johannes Tauler, Thomas à Kempis, John of Schoonhoven, and in subsequent times of the Franciscan Henry van Herp, the Carthusians Denis and Laurentius Surius, the Carmelite Thomas á Jesu, the Benedictine Louis de Blois, and the Jesuit Leonardus Lessius. Ernest Hello and especially Maurice Maeterlinck have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld&#x27;s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called &quot;Vägmärken&quot; (&#x27;Markings&#x27;).

Ruysbroeck insisted that the soul finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity. In the &quot;Kingdom of the Lovers of God&quot; he explains that those seeking wisdom must &quot;flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men&quot;, must &quot;fly in the air of the Rational faculty&quot; and &quot;refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God&quot;; thence (through grace) they will find an &quot;immense and boundless clearness&quot; bestowed upon their mind. In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (&quot;as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all&quot;), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (&quot;inward silence&quot;), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (&quot;even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched&quot;). His works, of which the most important were &quot;De vera contemplatione&quot; (&quot;On true contemplation&quot;) and &quot;De septem gradibus amoris&quot; (&quot;On the seven steps of love&quot;), were published in 1848 at Hanover; also &quot;Reflections from the Mirror of a Mystic&quot; (1906) and &quot;Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit&quot; (1901).

==Veneration and commemoration==
After Ruysbroeck&#x27;s death in 1381, his relics were carefully preserved and his memory honoured as that of a saint. After his death, stories called him the &quot;Ecstatic Doctor&quot; or &quot;Divine Doctor&quot;, and his views formed a link between the Friends of God and the Brethren of the Common Life, the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation.

When Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by Joseph II in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule&#x27;s, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the French Revolution. Ruysbroeck was beatified on 9 December 1908 by Pope Pius X via &quot;cultus confirmation&quot;.

No authentic portrait of Ruysbroeck is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren—rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.

At the University of Antwerp there is a Ruusbroec Institute for the study of the history of spirituality. There is also a secondary school called Jan-van-Ruusbroeckollege in Laken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.

== Cultural references ==
The epigraph of the 1884 novel &quot;À rebours&quot; by Joris-Karl Huysmans has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: &quot;I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time... though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.&quot; In this novel, Huysmans describes Ruysbroeck as &quot;un mystique du e siècle, dont la prose offrait un incompréhensible mais attirant amalgame d’exaltations ténébreuses, d’effusions caressantes, de transports âpres&quot; (&quot;a thirteenth century mystic whose prose presented an incomprehensible but attractive amalgam of gloomy ectasies, tender raptures, and violent rages.&quot;)

Ruysbroeck is mentioned in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, a novel by W. Somerset Maugham. The novel concerns the spiritual path of Laurence Darrell, who mentions to his fiancée early in the novel--as a way of testing whether she had inclinations similar to his-- that Ruysbroek was someone &#x27;he did not know at college&#x27; but whom he thought had found some answers to his life questions. 

Ruysbroek is also mentioned in Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s play, &quot;The Brontës of Haworth&quot; (in &quot;Three Plays&quot;, Duckworth, London, 1939).

<text>Jack Louis Del Rio Jr. (born April 4, 1963) is an American professional football coach and former linebacker who is the head coach of the Paris Musketeers of the European League of Football (ELF). He played college football for the USC Trojans from 1981 to 1984 and was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the third round of the 1985 NFL draft. He also played for the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and Miami Dolphins before retiring in 1996.

Del Rio began his coaching career as an assistant with the Saints in 1997. He then joined the Baltimore Ravens as a linebacker coach in 1999, where he was a part of their Super Bowl XXXV winning team that beat the New York Giants. Following a single-season stint as Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator, Del Rio became head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2003. He compiled a 68–71 record and two playoff appearances with them before being dismissed following the 2011 season.

Del Rio served as Denver Broncos defensive coordinator for the next three seasons before becoming head coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2015. He compiled a 25–23 record with the Raiders before being fired after the 2017 season. He spent the next two years working as an NFL analyst for ESPN and as the defensive coordinator of the Washington Commanders from 2020 until being dismissed midway through the 2023 season.

==Early life==
Jack Louis Del Rio Jr. was born in Castro Valley, California, to big bandleader Jack Del Rio Sr., who was of Spanish descent, and an Italian-American mother. Famed singer Peggy Lee was briefly Del Rio&#x27;s stepmother after having married Jack Sr. Del Rio attended Hayward High School in Hayward, California, where he developed into a notable three-sport athlete, earning all-state honors in football, baseball, and basketball.

In football, Del Rio helped his team win a North Coast Section 2A Championship. In baseball, although he was the starting catcher, in one game Jack was used as a pitcher and struck out 16 in a playoff game against Mission San Jose-Fremont. Del Rio and future Seattle Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu were teammates in baseball and football.

==College career==
Del Rio was selected out of high school by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 22nd round (550th overall) of the 1981 MLB Draft, but opted instead to accept a scholarship from the University of Southern California to play both football and baseball. In baseball, Del Rio was as a two-year starter at catcher on a team that also included future Major League Baseball players Mark McGwire and Randy Johnson, as well as future baseball executive Damon Oppenheimer.

Del Rio was a four-year starter in football. As a junior, he made the third-team 1983 All-American team. As a senior, Del Rio earned consensus All-American honors, was a runner-up for the Lombardi Award given to the nation&#x27;s best lineman or linebacker, and was named along with quarterback Tim Green co-MVP of the Rose Bowl. He finished his college career with 340 tackles, including 58 tackles for loss. Del Rio was named to the second-team All-Pac-10 in 1984, the first time in his college career he did not make first-team.

In 2015, Del Rio was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame. 

==Professional career==
===New Orleans Saints===
Del Rio was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the third round (68th overall) of the 1985 NFL draft. He was also selected by the Los Angeles Express in the 1985 USFL Territorial Draft. As a rookie, Jack started nine games at right inside linebacker, tied a franchise record with five fumble recoveries (including one returned for a 22-yard touchdown) and earned NFL All-rookie honors. Del Rio also collected 68 tackles, five passes defensed and three forced fumbles. In 1986, Del Rio lost his starting position to Alvin Toles after the season opener and recorded only 20 tackles during the season.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
In August 1987, Del Rio was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in exchange for a fifth round draft choice, reuniting him with former Saints defensive coordinator John Paul Young. He started nine games at right outside linebacker, tallying 45 tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble.

That season the NFL players went on strike in September, after week two. Throughout this period of time, Del Rio and teammates picketed outside of Arrowhead Stadium and were vigilantly watching for replacement players attempting to enter the facility. He mistakenly mistook former Chiefs wide receiver Otis Taylor for a replacement player and assaulted him. At the time, the 45-year-old Taylor was a scout for the Chiefs organization and had been retired for twelve years. Taylor later pressed charges and the two eventually settled out of court.

Del Rio started ten games at left outside linebacker in 1988, registering 77 tackles, one sack, and one pass defensed. He was released on August 29, 1989.

Del Rio earned an undergraduate degree in political science from the University of Kansas while he was a player for the Kansas City Chiefs.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On August 30, 1989, Del Rio was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys. He was named the starter at strongside linebacker in the fifth game against the Green Bay Packers, where he suffered a bruised calf that forced him to miss the next two games. Del Rio started twelve contests at strongside linebacker, while sharing the position with David Howard in the final eight games, playing in the first and third quarters, finishing the season with 58 tackles, two fumble recoveries (including one returned for a 57-yard touchdown) and one pass defensed.

The next year, Del Rio started all sixteen games at strongside linebacker, making 104 tackles (third on the team), 1.5 sacks, four quarterback pressures and two passes defensed. In 1991, Del Rio replaced Eugene Lockhart as the starter at middle linebacker, while leading the team with 130 total tackles, 53 assists and 77 solo tackles.

In the 1990s, the Cowboys organization felt they could avoid paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap by drafting linebackers, so they allowed players like Del Rio, Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards, Robert Jones, and Randall Godfrey to leave via free agency.

===Minnesota Vikings===

On March 4, 1992, Del Rio signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent. He led the team in tackles for three consecutive years and was selected to the 1995 Pro Bowl. In 1995, Del Rio suffered a knee injury in a game against the Chicago Bears and only played one more game that season, which would prove to be the last of his career.

===Miami Dolphins===
On June 2, 1996, Del Rio signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins, reuniting him with former Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson. On August 4, he was released after being passed on the depth chart by rookie Zach Thomas. Del Rio finished his career with 160 game appearances (128 starts), 1,005 tackles, 13 sacks, and 13 interceptions.

==NFL career statistics==
==Coaching career==

Del Rio was hired by New Orleans Saints head coach Mike Ditka as the team&#x27;s strength and conditioning coach in 1997, moving to linebacker coach the next year. In 1999, he took the same job with the Baltimore Ravens. Del Rio is, in part, credited for the success of the Ravens&#x27; Super Bowl-winning defense, particularly in the 2000 season. After the 2001 season, he was named defensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers and in his first season, in 2002, Del Rio led them to the second ranked defense in the league by total yards.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===

In 2003, Del Rio became the second head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars following Tom Coughlin&#x27;s dismissal. In his first season, he led the team to a 5–11 record. That year, Jacksonville finished the season with the second-ranked rush defense and sixth best overall defense, having ranked 25th and 20th in those two categories, respectively, the year prior. In 2004, the Jaguars narrowly missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record, the first winning record in five seasons. The following season, the team made the playoffs for the first time since advancing all the way to the AFC title game in 1999. They qualified as a wild card; however, the season was ended with a 28–3 loss to the New England Patriots.

The mantra &quot;keep chopping wood&quot;, introduced by Del Rio during the season, was intended to indicate how the team would slowly whittle away the huge obstacles in front of them. Del Rio placed a wooden stump and axe in the Jaguars&#x27; locker room as a symbol of his rallying cry. After his teammates had been taking swings at the wood with the axe, punter Chris Hanson followed suit and seriously wounded his non-kicking foot. Hanson missed the remainder of the 2003 season, being replaced by Mark Royals.

After missing the playoffs in 2006, Jacksonville cut quarterback Byron Leftwich in favor of David Garrard. The team returned to the playoffs in 2007 winning their first playoff game since 1999. On April 3, 2008, Del Rio&#x27;s contract with the Jaguars was extended through the 2012 season.

On January 11, 2010, Del Rio was offered the head coaching job at USC, his alma mater. The next day he denied receiving an offer from USC, stating that the offer was &quot;manufactured&quot;. Later that afternoon, he rebuffed USC officially, announcing that he would remain with the Jaguars at least through the duration of his current contract.

On November 29, 2011, Del Rio was fired as Jacksonville&#x27;s head coach. He left with a regular season record of 68–71 and a 1–2 record in two playoff appearances over his nine years. From his years with the Jaguars, Del Rio holds the NFL record for the longest tenure of any head coach to have never won a division title.

===Denver Broncos===
On January 27, 2012, Del Rio was hired as the new defensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos. In Week 2, Del Rio was fined $25,000 for berating the replacement officials. On November 4, 2013, Del Rio was handed the head coaching duties and named interim head coach for several games when head coach John Fox was sidelined for medical reasons.

===Oakland Raiders===
On January 14, 2015, Del Rio was hired to become the new head coach of the Oakland Raiders, replacing the fired Dennis Allen (who coincidentally had preceded him as the Broncos defensive coordinator) and interim head coach Tony Sparano.

In 2016, Del Rio led the Raiders to a 12–4 record, with the team making the playoffs for the first time since 2002. They lost to the Houston Texans in the wild card round.

On February 10, 2017, Del Rio signed a four-year contract extension. Del Rio was fired after the Raiders&#x27; 30–10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in the 2017 regular season finale, ending with a 6–10 record.

In 2019, he was under consideration to become the defensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals, but talks ultimately ended after new head coach Zac Taylor decided he was not a fit.

===Washington Football Team / Commanders===

On January 2, 2020, Del Rio was hired by the Washington Football Team to serve as their defensive coordinator under head coach Ron Rivera. Del Rio changed their defensive scheme from a 3-4, which the team had used for the past decade, to a 4-3.

In June 2022, Del Rio made a controversial comment on his personal Twitter account where he referred the Capitol attack as a &quot;dust up&quot; and compared the storming of the Capitol to overturn official election results to the civil unrest that occurred during some of the 2020 George Floyd protests. In response to his comments the Washington Commanders fined Del Rio for $100,000 along with head coach Ron Rivera publicly stating Del Rio&#x27;s views are not a reflection of the team. Del Rio was fired in November 2023 following a 45–10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving, in which the team had allowed the most points in the NFL by that point in the season.

===Wisconsin Badgers===
On August 29, 2024, Del Rio was hired by the Wisconsin Badgers as a senior adviser to head football coach Luke Fickell. He resigned on November 11, 2024, after being arrested days prior for hitting a street sign and breaking a fence in Madison, Wisconsin, while operating a car impaired.

===Paris Musketeers===
On January 27, 2025, Del Rio was hired as the head coach and defensive coordinator for the Paris Musketeers of the European League of Football (ELF).

<text>HMS &quot;A1&quot; was the Royal Navy&#x27;s first British-designed submarine, and their first to suffer fatal casualties.

She was the lead ship of the first British s and the only one to have a single bow torpedo tube. She was actually sunk twice: first in 1904 when she became the first submarine casualty, with the loss of all hands; however, she was recovered, but sank again in 1911, this time when she was unmanned. The wreck was discovered in 1989 and was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act in 1998. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England.

==Design and construction==
She was an enlarged and improved – longer than the Royal Navy&#x27;s five &quot;Holland&quot;-type boats. Subsequent A-class boats were even larger and differed from her in several respects.

Like all members of her class, she was built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness. She was laid down on 19 February 1902 and launched on 9 July 1902.

Before she left the yard she suffered from a hydrogen explosion. Later while under tow to Portsmouth to join with the rest of the navy&#x27;s submarines, seawater managed to reach her batteries, which gave off chlorine gas, forcing the evacuation of the vessel.

==Casualty, recovery, loss and rediscovery==

She was accidentally sunk in the Solent on 18 March 1904 whilst carrying out a practice attack on the protected cruiser by being struck on the starboard side of the conning tower by a mail steamer, SS &quot;Berwick Castle&quot;, which was &quot;en route&quot; from Southampton to Hamburg. She sank in only of water, but the boat flooded and the entire crew was drowned. One consequence was that all subsequent Royal Navy submarines were equipped with a watertight hatch at the bottom of the conning tower.

She was raised on 18 April 1904 and repaired and re-entered service. Following a petrol explosion in August 1910, she was converted to a testbed for the Admiralty&#x27;s Anti-Submarine Committee. She was lost a year later when running submerged but unmanned under automatic pilot. Although the position of her sinking was known at the time, all efforts to locate her were fruitless. It was not until 1989 that the wreck was discovered by a local fisherman at Bracklesham Bay, approximately away. It is thought that she was only partially flooded when she sank, and the resulting partial buoyancy meant that the wreck moved in the strong local currents. The wreck was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act on 26 November 1998 and redesignated to extend the area covered on 5 October 2004.

<doc id="852638" wikidata="Q922942" url="?curid=852638" title="Pleiades (Greek mythology)">
<text>The Pleiades (; , ), were the seven sister-nymphs, companions of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. Together with their sisters, the Hyades, they were called the Atlantides, Dodonides, or Nysiades, nursemaids and teachers of the infant Dionysus. The Pleiades were thought to have been translated to the night sky as a cluster of stars, the Pleiades, and were associated with rain.

== Etymology ==
The name Pleiades ostensibly derived from the name of their mother, Pleione, effectively meaning &quot;daughters of Pleione&quot;. However, etymologically, the name of the star-cluster likely came first, and Pleione&#x27;s name indicated that she was the mother of the Pleiades. According to another suggestion &quot;Pleiades&quot; derived from πλεῖν (&quot;plein&quot;, &quot;to sail&quot;) because of the cluster&#x27;s importance in delimiting the sailing season in the Mediterranean Sea: &quot;the season of navigation began with their heliacal rising&quot;.

== Family ==
The Pleiades&#x27; parents were the Titan Atlas and the Oceanid Pleione born on Mount Cyllene. In some accounts, their mother was called Aethra, another Oceanid. Aside from the above-mentioned sisters (the Hyades), the Pleiades&#x27; other siblings were Hyas and the nymph Calypso who was famous in the tale of Odysseus. Sometimes they were related as half-sisters to the Hesperides, nymphs of the morning star.

== Names ==
Several of the most prominent male Olympian gods (including Zeus, Poseidon, and Ares) engaged in affairs with the seven heavenly sisters. These relationships resulted in the birth of their children.
# Maia, eldest of the seven Pleiades, was mother of Hermes by Zeus.
# Electra, mother of Dardanus and Iasion, by Zeus.
# Taygete, mother of Lacedaemon, also by Zeus.
# Alcyone, mother of Hyrieus, Hyperenor and Aethusa; Hyperes and Anthas; and Epopeus by Poseidon.
# Celaeno, mother of Lycus and Nycteus by Poseidon; and of Eurypylus and Euphemus also by Poseidon.
# Sterope, also Asterope, mother of King Oenomaus of Elis by Ares or wife of Oenomaus instead.
# Merope, youngest of the Pleiades. In other mythic contexts, she married Sisyphus and, becoming mortal, faded away. Merope bore Sisyphus several sons including Glaucus.

== Mythology ==

After Atlas was forced to carry the heavens on his shoulders, Orion began to pursue all of the Pleiades, and Zeus transformed them first into doves, and then into stars to comfort their father. The constellation of Orion is said to still pursue them across the night sky.

One of the most memorable myths involving the Pleiades is the story of how these sisters literally became stars, their &quot;catasterism&quot;. According to some versions of the tale, all seven sisters killed themselves because they were so saddened by either the fate of their father, Atlas, or the loss of their siblings, the Hyades. In turn, Zeus, the ruler of the Greek gods, immortalized the sisters by placing them in the sky. There these seven stars formed the star cluster known thereafter as the Pleiades.

The Greek poet Hesiod mentions the Pleiades several times in his &quot;Works and Days&quot;. As the Pleiades are primarily winter stars, they feature prominently in the ancient agricultural calendar. Here is a bit of advice from Hesiod:

The Pleiades would &quot;flee mighty Orion and plunge into the misty deep&quot; as they set in the West, which they would begin to do just before dawn during October–November, a good time of the year to lay up your ship after the fine summer weather and &quot;remember to work the land&quot;; in Mediterranean agriculture autumn is the time to plough and sow.

The poet Sappho mentions the Pleiades in one of her poems:The moon has goneThe Pleiades goneIn dead of nightTime passes onI lie aloneThe poet Lord Tennyson mentions the Pleiades in his poem &quot;Locksley Hall&quot;:Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades star cluster disappeared from view by the naked eye.

Pleiades and Orion are mentioned in the Book of Job:

== Alternative version ==
Although most accounts are uniform as to the number, names, and main myths concerning the Pleiades, the mythological information recorded by a scholiast on Theocritus&#x27; Idylls with reference to Callimachus has nothing in common with the traditional version. According to it, the Pleiades were daughters of an Amazonian queen; their names were Maia, Coccymo, Glaucia, Protis, Parthenia, Stonychia, and Lampado. They were credited with inventing ritual dances and nighttime festivals.

<text>The Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon was an award of the United States Navy which was authorized for issuance between the years of 1930 and 1941. The ribbon was established by order of Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal in 1946.

The Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon was issued to any officer of the Naval Reserve who had commanded a Naval Reserve Battalion for a period exceeding four years. To be eligible for the Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon, an officer must also have served longer than ten years in the Naval Reserve as a whole.

The decoration was issued as a one-time-only award, and there were no devices authorized for additional awards of the Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon. The Reserve Special Commendation Ribbon end date was established on December 7, 1941, in light of the massive expansion and call-up of reserves for duty in World War II.

<doc id="852647" wikidata="Q7295785" url="?curid=852647" title="Rationale for gifted programs">
<text>When children are young, schools begin to analyze the youngsters’ abilities and sort them into clusters based on their predicted success. The system labels the cream of the crop as gifted. Clark (2002) defines giftedness as “only a label that society gives to those who have actualized their ability to an unusually high degree or give evidence that such achievement is imminent”. The American government defines giftedness as “students, children or youth who give evidence of high performance capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop such capabilities” (Clark, 2002). Gifted students learn in a different manner and at an accelerated rate compared to their peers in the classroom and therefore require gifted programs to develop and apply their talents.

Gifted children need outside instruction and development opportunities to expand their minds and become most useful to society and themselves. In a list of reasons compiled in &quot;Fostering Academic Excellence&quot;, McLeod and Cropley (1989) describe the specific advantages to placing gifted children in adequate programs:
#“Gifted children are a resource”; here the need for inventive and intelligent minds who will improve the quality of life and advance in the new technological age is stated.
#“The gifted deserve special treatment corresponding to that received by the handicapped;” the gifted ought to have the same financial support that is given to other groups that are far from the “norm”.
#“Gifted children need adequate stimulation;” a debate is raised between the incentive that gifted children gain by being in an isolated class of the top five-percent and the argument that normal and slow children would benefit from being mixed in with giftedness.
#“Special provision for the gifted will prevent dropouts, underachievement and delinquency;” gifted children may lose their zest for school when kept back from learning at their own pace and may almost strive to achieve “normality” to “have a quiet life in school”. (McLeod &amp; Cropley, 1989).

Not only is it important to give the gifted the extra push which is beneficial to society, those students’ minds also operate in a unique way and require a different style of teaching. “The intellectually adept think and learn differently from others…it is important to teach them appropriately” (Freeman et al., 1999). As Merenheimo is quoted in the Journal of Biological Education, “gifted pupils have an analytic strategy of perceiving information. The less gifted use either atomistic or serialistic strategies” (Freeman et al., 1999). Gifted children were also found to be more ambitious—both in the difficulty and effort put into the task—in their schoolwork than others their age. (Freeman et al., 1999).

Schools should bear some responsibility to nurture the talents of the gifted students in their charge. “It is clear from the evidence that excellence does not emerge without appropriate help…. To reach an exceptionally high standard in any area, potentially gifted children need the means to learn; this includes the material to work with and focused, challenging tuition, sometimes including tutoring or mentoring that is not provided in normal schools” (Freeman et al., 1999). Two methods mentioned by Freeman that schools use in the teaching of gifted children are: 1. Accelerating the learning of children, either by moving them up to an older age-group or compacting the material they have to learn, and 2. Enrichment, rounding out, and deepening the material to be learned (Freeman et al., 1999).

==Classroom guidelines for teaching the gifted==
* “To be at their most effective, pupils can be helped to identify their own ways of learning, which will include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn. They should also be helped to be aware of their attitudes to the area to be learned, such as curiosity, persistence, and confidence.” (Freeman et al., 1999).
* “All the evidence indicates that specific provision within subject areas is by far the most effective in promoting talent, rather than general enrichment without identified goals.” (Freeman et al., 1999)
* “Meaningful curriculum experiences for gifted learners need to be carefully planned, written down, implemented, and evaluated in order to maximize potential effect.” (Van Tassel-Baska, 2000)
* Giftedness “can be furthered only by participation in learning experiences that challenge and extend from the point of the child’s talent, ability, and interest” (Clark, 2002).

Gifted students may not reach their full potential with the standards of regular classwork, which can appear to progress at a slowed rate. They may become isolated from their peers on a social level, since intellectual pursuit for the sake of itself is their primary motivation. These students may receive the desired enrichment when put among other high achievers via accelerated coursework and by allowing them to develop their own ideas and viewpoints. Programs tailored for gifted students can cultivate an environment conducive to their success.

==Difficulties with socialization==
A common myth concerning gifted youth in regular classrooms is that the gifted are a great asset to other students and, through their brilliance, help those of normal intelligence to become better students. According to the National Association for Gifted Children, the self-confidence of normal students is not heightened by the presence of a brilliant young mind. Conversely, historical examples of jealousy and spite toward gifted students have been noted by writers. Leonard Mlodinow recounts of Isaac Newton&#x27;s school years that &quot;being different and clearly intellectually superior brought Newton the same reaction then as it would today—the other kids hated him.&quot;

An additional concern is that gifted children who are pulled from their traditional grade level classroom for enrichment education will fail to strive in their social relationships. It has been shown, however, that students who participate in either in-class or pull-out programs that are at least mostly meeting the academic needs of the student, will tend to form strong relationships with their peers, be well-rounded students, and act an age that is appropriate for their own wellness. In fact, studies have shown that gifted students, whether lowly gifted, moderately gifted, or highly gifted “were, on a whole, socially well adjusted, and there seemed to be no relation between increased intelligence and social adjustment”. Students who are allowed to meet their academic needs, at any level, tend to be more secure and confident in their social needs and in turn form more significant relationships with their age peers. While many link a child&#x27;s social growth with their academic growth and assume that one must suffer in order for the other to prosper, this has been statistically shown to not be the case.

==Assessment==
So now that the necessity of these gifted programs have been established, how then do schools and talent search programs identify who meet the criteria for being gifted? National Excellence: A Case for Developing America&#x27;s Talent suggests that the following guidelines be used (Clark, 2002):

#Look at a variety of disciplines for outstanding students.
#Use a variety of tests and other assessment measures to find and serve students who express high levels of ability in different ways and at different ages.
#Ensure that all students have equal access to challenging learning opportunities and unbiased assessment.
#Develop assessment procedures that allow varying rates of maturity and interests.
#Seek students whose potential evidences itself in diverse and less obvious ways.
#Consider motivational factors such as interest, drive, and passion in assessing accomplishment.

There are six areas of ability which are often evaluated in order to determine whether or not a child is gifted: generic, cognitive, academic, creative, leadership, and visual and performing arts. They are measured in combinations of standardized tests, peer and teacher evaluations and nominations, and observations of the particular child. As for the legitimacy of these methods, Olszewski-Kubilius assures us that “the available research evidence suggests that these practices are valid” (Olszewski-Kubilius et al., 1998).

<doc id="852652" wikidata="Q383493" url="?curid=852652" title="Local government areas of Scotland (1975–1996)">
<text>The local government areas of Scotland were redefined by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and redefined again by the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994.

The 1973 Act created a system of nine two-tier regions and three islands areas, and this system completely replaced local government counties and burghs in 1975. The new regions were generally very different from the counties which had been in use since the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Also, the districts were very different from the subdivisions of counties, also called districts, which had been in use since the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.

==Background==
The reorganisation of local government in Scotland was a matter of political debate from the mid-1960s. In June 1963 the Scottish Office published a white paper titled &quot;The Modernization of Local Government in Scotland&quot; (Cmnd.2067). This proposed a large decrease in the number of local authorities in the country. There was to be a reduction from thirty-three county councils to between ten and fifteen. At the same time, new &quot;second-tier councils&quot; were proposed, with burghs being merged with the surrounding &quot;landward&quot; rural areas. The minimum population for the areas of these councils was to be 40,000. It was hoped that the reforms could be carried out quickly, with existing authorities agreeing to amalgamation and boundary alterations prior to legislation being passed. The white paper was rejected by the Association of Large Burghs, and by the Scottish Labour Party. At the 1964 general election Labour came to power, and the scheme was not pursued. Instead a royal commission under the chairmanship of Lord Wheatley was appointed in 1966 to enquire into local administration. Wheatley commented that &quot;Our terms of reference are far-reaching: we have a free hand to recommend whatever arrangement of authorities, boundaries and functions seem likely to be right for a long time to come&quot;.

The commission&#x27;s report was delivered on 25 September 1969, and recommended a two-tier system of 7 regions and 37 districts. The incoming Conservative government accepted the broad principles of the commission&#x27;s report in their white paper &quot;Reform of Local Government in Scotland&quot; (Cmnd. 4583), published in February 1971. The number of regions was increased to 8, and of districts to 49. Also Orkney and Shetland were to become &quot;most-purpose&quot; authorities, separated from the Highland Region. Following consultation, the structure was modified. The Western Isles, which was to have formed four districts of the Highland Region, became an islands area, with the same status as Orkney and Shetland. The number of districts was to remain at 49 in number, but with considerable boundary changes. These were the areas included in the Local Government (Scotland) Bill as introduced to parliament in 1973. Considerable changes were made during the passage of the legislation. Fife, which was to have been divided between the South-East and East Regions, was to become a region on the same boundaries as the existing county. This increased the number of regions to nine. The number of districts was increased to 53, numerous boundary changes were made and regions and districts renamed.

The first elections to the new district and regional councils were held on 7 May 1974, with the councillors sitting as &quot;shadow authorities&quot; until 16 May 1975 when they came into their powers.

==Structure==

===Regions===
Regions had a two-tier system of local government, with each region divided into districts, varying from 3 to 19 in number.

The top tier of local government was the regional council. Services provided at the regional level were those needing greater finance or resources, or best exercised over a wide area. These included police, fire services, consumer protection, education and transport.

Each district had an elected district council. In the case of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, the districts had city status, although this did not confer any additional powers. District councils had responsibility for local services including local planning, housing, libraries and licensing.

===Islands areas===
The islands areas were unitary local government areas, exercising the powers of both a regional and district council.

== Regions and islands areas ==

Scotland was subdivided into regions and islands areas as follows:

== Districts ==


==Abolition==
The 1994 Act created 29 new unitary local government areas, which completely replaced the regions and districts on 1 April 1996. The islands council areas continued in use and, therefore, Scotland now has 32 council areas.

<doc id="852658" wikidata="Q613266" url="?curid=852658" title="Vladimir Nazlymov">
<text>Vladimir Aliverovich Nazlymov (born November 1, 1945; ) is a former sabre fencer, and coach for the USSR and later the United States, to which he moved in 1991, of Crimean Tatar origin. He won three team Olympic sabre gold medals, and was the head coach of the Soviet Union Military Fencing Team for 14 years. He then coached in the United States, notably for Ohio State University, from which he retired in lieu of termination during an NCAA investigation that found him guilty of aggravated level I violations, sanctioned him, and vacated a number of records of the team and its members. He now serves as a coach at the Nazlymov Fencing Foundation, which was founded by his son and daughter-in-law.

==Early years==
Nazlymov was born in Makhachkala, Daghestan, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, to a Crimean Tatar family. He said in an interview that when he was a child, he was &quot;not a nice kid,&quot; and was constantly in trouble.

Nazlymov graduated from the Faculty of Physical Education of the Dagestan State Pedagogical Institute in 1969 as a teacher.

Nazlymov served 25 years in the Soviet Army, where he was a colonel. He was in a special regimen where he was able to fence full-time with the CSKA Moscow Central Army Sports Club team in Moscow, a department of the Russian Defense Ministry.

==Fencing career==
Nazlymov began fencing in Makhachkala. Competing for the Soviet Union, he was a three-time Olympic team gold medalist (1968, 1976, 1980), team silver medalist (1972), and individual silver and bronze medalist (1976, 1972). In addition, he was an 8-time team world champion, and twice won the individual world championship (1975, 1979). He was a world championship silver medalist in 1977, and bronze medalist in 1970 and 1973. In the 1970s, he was the USSR individual sabre champion six times. The Soviet Union awarded him the title of Master of the Sport of the USSR (fencing) in 1968.

==Coaching career==
===USSR===
Nazlymov&#x27;s coaching career began in Moscow as the head coach of the Soviet Union Military Fencing Team from 1976 to 1990. He said the team had the best facilities, as &quot;Army is army. They have everything.&quot; The Central Army Sports Club (ЦСКА) in Moscow was a Soviet national team training facility. From 1970 to 1980, Nazlymov served as the captain of the fencing team of the Soviet Union at the Olympics. His students won two Olympic gold medals and 12 world championships, as well as eight European Championship crowns. From 1986 to 1988, Nazlymov served as the head coach of the Soviet National Fencing Team. The USSR won a gold medal at the 1986 World Championships and silver medals at the 1987 Worlds and 1988 Olympics.

===United States===
Nazlymov moved to the United States with his family in 1991. Years later, commenting on his allegiance to Russia, he said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t even change my passport. I lived in the States for many years, but never left Russia.&quot; From 1991 to 1999, he was a fencing coach at Central High School, an inner-city high school in Kansas City, Missouri. He captained the USA team at the World Championships from 1995 to 1997 and at the 1995 and 1997 World University Games. Nazlymov also served as the sabre coach for the U.S. National Team from 1994 to 1999. Nazlymov guided U.S. teams to a ninth-place finish at the 1996 Olympics, third place at the 1997 Junior World Championships, and 12th place at the Senior World Championships. He was named a coach for the U.S. 1999 Pan American Games and 1999 Senior World Championships teams. His US Junior Team finished in second place in the overall medal count at the Junior Worlds in 2001. In 1999, he was named Coach of the Year by the United States Fencing Association. In 2019, Nazlymov became the sabre coach of the Uzbekistan national fencing team.

====Ohio State University====
In the end of 1999, Nazlymov was hired by Ohio State University (OSU), after spending eight years as the fencing coach for the Kansas City, Missouri School District and establishing a private club in the Kansas City area (KCFC). In the 2003–04 and 2007–08 seasons, Nazlymov guided Ohio State Buckeyes to the NCAA Fencing Championship, and produced a number of individual NCAA champions (Adam Crompton, Boaz Ellis, Andras Horanyi). Two of his students, Jason Rogers and Louise Bond-Williams, qualified for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, and OSU fencing team member Siobhan Byrne participated at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. At OSU as of 2005, Nazlymov&#x27;s fencers had a combined record of 292–148 (.614), but after a subsequent NCAA investigation many of his later wins were vacated by the NCAA. In 2015–16, he was paid $223,693 for coaching at OSU. He retired from coaching at OSU in Spring 2018.

===NCAA investigation and sanctions===
While Nazlymov had retired in 2018, in 2020 his departure was revised from &quot;retired&quot; to &quot;retired in lieu of termination.&quot; That year, as the NCAA was investigating the OSU fencing program for infractions, OSU self-imposed a 2020–21 postseason ban for its fencing program.

In April 2022, the NCAA Division I Committee on Infractions panel, upon the conclusion of an investigation, found that Nazlymov had violated NCAA head coach responsibility rules, and was guilty of aggravated level I violations. Further, he violated ethical conduct rules, by ignoring several requests that had been made to him to cooperate with the NCAA investigation. The panel found that: &quot;The head fencing coach violated fundamental, well-known bylaws. Worse, the head fencing coach received relevant education on the exact areas of the violations as they were occurring, but continued to commit the same violations and, in some circumstances, concealed them from compliance staff.&quot; The NCAA said Nazlymov arranged, provided, or directed other coaches to give more than $6,000 in recruiting inducements to three fencers, primarily by giving them free access to the OSU fencing facility. Two of the prospects also received free meals and free private lessons from Nazylmov, which allowed OSU coaches to observe the fencers, and constituted impermissible tryouts, and received other inducements. It also found that under Nazlymov&#x27;s direction, in addition 18 student fencers also received impermissible benefits worth over $8,000 in the form of free access to his local fencing club, resulting in them competing while ineligible.

The NCAA sanctioned Nazlymov with a 10-year show-cause order. He was restricted from any athletically related duties by any NCAA school hiring him, unless that school could demonstrate why such restriction should not apply. If Nazlymov is hired after his show cause order ends, he will be suspended from 100% of his first season of employment.

The NCAA also meted out additional punishments to the school athletic department and fencing program. The Ohio State fencing team was placed on four years of probation for NCAA violations committed between 2015 and 2019. In addition, the OSU athletic department was fined, and the OSU fencing program budget was reduced by 3%. The fencing program scholarship program was reduced by 10% for the 2022–23 academic year. Team wins and championships, and individual records for affected fencers, were vacated, including the 2016 and 2017 second-place finishes and a 2018 third-place finish in the NCAAs for the fencing team, and Midwest Fencing Conference championships in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

==Officiating==
Nazlymov officiated sabre fencing at the 1988 Olympic Games.

==Family==
Nazlymov&#x27;s son, Vitali, attended Penn State University and won the 1991 individual NCAA saber championship.

His granddaughter Tatiana Nazlymov trains in saber at the Nazlymov Fencing Foundation founded by her father (Vitali) and mother, where Vladimir also coaches, with Fikrat Valiyev as her primary coach. In December 2023, Phil Andrews, the CEO of USA Fencing, wrote to the International Fencing Federation that there was &quot;likely to be improper officiating&quot; of bouts involving Tatiana Nazlymov, and that video evidence indicated that calls made by two referees in bouts involving her demonstrated &quot;a likely favoritism&quot; toward her; in addition, in a letter to Tatiana that month he informed her that &quot;we are aware of this alleged manipulation of the sport.&quot; Her mother, Vladimir&#x27;s daughter-in-law, wrote that &quot;Tatiana is absolutely innocent and the cheating/matchfixing accusation is ridiculous.&quot; Vitali Nazlymov said that he himself behaved according to the rules, but that &quot;fencing is a small world and conflicts exist everywhere.&quot; Tatiana has qualified for Team USA in the 2024 Olympics.

==Clubs==
Nazlymov owned a club in Columbus, Ohio, called the Fencing Alliance of Ohio. The club disbanded in 2018.

In 2016 in Russia, an order was given in the Republic of Dagestan, Makhachkala, by region Governor Ramazan Abdulatipov to create a fencing school named after Nazlymov.

In 2018, his son Vitali and daughter-in-law established Nazlymov Fencing Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland. He joined it that year as a coach after leaving Ohio State University, joining coach and referee Fikrat Valiyev and coach and former Russian national team member Alex Filatov, along with his son who is also a coach and referee. His son is the principal officer. Most of its fencers are saber fencers.

==Writing==
Nazlymov wrote the foreword to &quot;Foil, Saber, and Épée Fencing: Skills, Safety, Operations, and Responsibilities&quot; (1994) by Maxwell R. Garret, Guglielmo Pezza, and Emmanuil G. Kaidanov.

<doc id="852663" wikidata="Q293464" url="?curid=852663" title="Al-Kamil">
<text>Al-Malik al-Kamil Nasir ad-Din Muhammad (; – 6 March 1238), titled Abu al-Maali (), was an Egyptian ruler and the fourth Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. During his tenure as sultan, the Ayyubids defeated the Fifth Crusade. He was known to the Frankish crusaders as Meledin, a name by which he is referred to in some older western sources. As a result of the Sixth Crusade, he ceded West Jerusalem to the Christians and is known to have met with Saint Francis.

== Biography ==

=== Jazira campaign ===
Al-Kamil was the son of the Kurdish sultan al-Adil (&quot;Saphadin&quot;), a brother of Saladin. Al-Kamil&#x27;s father was laying siege to the city of Mardin (in modern-day Turkey) in 1199 when he was called away urgently to deal with a security threat in Damascus. Al-Adil left al-Kamil to command the forces around Mardin continuing the siege. Taking advantage of the Sultan&#x27;s absence, the combined forces of Mosul, Sinjar and Jazirat ibn Umar appeared at Mardin when it was on the point of surrender, and drew Al-Kamil into battle. Although he was badly defeated and retreated to Mayyafariqin, dissent and weakness among his opponents meant that Al-Kamil was able to secure Ayyubid rule in the Jazira Region by taking Harran (in modern-day Turkey).

=== Viceroy of Egypt ===
In 1200, after proclaiming himself Sultan, Al-Adil invited Al-Kamil to come from the Eastern Territories to join him in Egypt as his viceroy (na&#x27;ib) in that country. Al-Adil&#x27;s second son, Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa, had already been made prince of Damascus in 1198. It appears that Al-Adil allowed Al-Kamil a fairly high degree of authority, since he oversaw much of the work on the Cairo Citadel, issued decrees in his own name, and even managed to persuade his father to dismiss the powerful minister Ibn Shukr. Al-Kamil remained viceroy until his father&#x27;s death in 1218 when he became Sultan himself.

=== The Fifth Crusade ===

When Al-Adid died on 31 August 1218, the Ayyubid domains were divided into three parts, with Al-Kamil ruling Egypt, his brother Al-Muazzam Isa ruling in Palestine and Transjordan, and a third brother, 
Al-Ashraf Musa in Syria and the Jazira. Nominally the other two recognised Al-Kamil&#x27;s supremacy as Sultan. Unusually for an Ayyubid succession, there was no obvious dissent or rivalry between the brothers at this point, partly because just before Al-Adil&#x27;s death, Egypt had been attacked by the forces of the Fifth Crusade.

Al-Kamil took command of the forces which defended Damietta against the Crusaders. In 1219 he was almost overthrown by a conspiracy led by the amir Imad ad-Din ibn al-Mashtub, commander of the Hakkari Kurdish regiment, to replace him with his younger and more pliant brother al-Faiz Ibrahim. Alerted to the conspiracy, Al-Kamil had to flee the camp to safety and in the ensuing confusion the Crusaders were able to tighten their grip on Damietta. Al-Kamil considered fleeing to Yemen, which was ruled by his son al-Mas&#x27;ud Yusuf, but the timely arrival of his brother Al-Muazzam from Syria with reinforcements brought the conspiracy to a swift end.

Al-Kamil made many offers of peace to the Crusaders, all of which were rejected, due to the influence of the papal legate Pelagius. He offered to return Jerusalem and rebuild its walls (which his brother had torn down earlier in the year), and to return the True Cross (which he probably did not have). At one point he even met with Francis of Assisi, who had accompanied the crusade. Their meeting became a subject for painters like Giotto, Taddeo di Bartolo and Taddeo Gaddi.

Due to famine and disease after the Nile failed to flood, al-Kamil could not defend Damietta and it was captured in November 1219. The sultan withdrew to al-Mansourah, a fortress further up the Nile. After this there was little action until 1221, when al-Kamil offered peace again, proposing to surrender the entire territory of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, except Transjordan, in return for the Crusaders evacuating Egypt but was again refused. The Crusaders marched out towards Cairo, but al-Kamil simply opened the dams and allowed the Nile to flood, and finally the Crusaders accepted an eight-year peace. He retook Damietta in September.

===Power struggle and the treaty of 1229 ===

In the following years there was a power struggle with his brother al-Mu&#x27;azzam, and al-Kamil was willing to accept a peace with emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II, who was planning the Sixth Crusade. Al-Mu&#x27;azzam died in 1227, eliminating the need for a peace, but Frederick had already arrived in Palestine. After al-Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s death, al-Kamil and his other brother al-Ashraf negotiated a treaty, giving all of Palestine (including Transjordan) to al-Kamil and Syria to al-Ashraf. In February 1229 al-Kamil negotiated the Treaty of Jaffa, a ten-year peace with Frederick II and returned Jerusalem and other holy sites to the Crusader kingdom.

The treaty of 1229 is unique in the history of the Crusades. By diplomacy alone and without major military confrontation, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and a corridor running to the sea were ceded to the kingdom of Jerusalem. Exception was made for the Temple area, the Dome of the Rock, and the Aqsa Mosque, which the Muslims retained. Moreover, all current Muslim residents of the city would retain their homes and property. They would also have their own city officials to administer a separate justice system and safeguard their religious interests. The walls of Jerusalem, which had been destroyed, were rebuilt, and the peace was to last for 10 years.

After the treat with Frederick, al-Kamil turned his attention to Damascus. He sent al-Ashraf to begin operations against the city. He arrived to pen the siege of Damascus on 6 May. After almost two months of intense fighting, the city surrendered on 25 June. It was given to al-Ashraf, while al-Muazzam&#x27;s son, an-Nasir Dawud, had to settle for Transjordan.

===Later years===
Although there was peace with the Crusaders, al-Kamil had to contend with the Seljuks and the Khwarezmians before he died in 1238.

His sons as-Salih Ayyub and al-Adil II succeeded him in Syria and Egypt respectively, but the Ayyubid empire soon descended into civil war. In 1239 the treaty with Frederick expired, and Jerusalem came under Ayyubid control.

== Personality ==
Al-Kamil exemplified the Islamic laws of war. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the Fifth Crusade, Oliver of Paderborn praised and commented on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:

<doc id="852668" wikidata="Q5631176" url="?curid=852668" title="HMS A2">
<text>HMS &quot;A2&quot; was an submarine built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century.

==Design and description==
&quot;A2&quot; was a member of the first British class of submarines, although slightly larger, faster and more heavily armed than the lead ship, . The submarine had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 9 ratings.

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder Wolseley petrol engine that drove one propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, &quot;A2&quot; had a range of at ; submerged the boat had a range of at .

The boats were armed with two 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as in doing so they had to compensate for their weight by an equivalent weight of fuel.

==Construction and career==
Like all boats in her class, she was built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness. Construction started in 1902 and the submarine was launched on 15 April 1903 and completed on 26 March 1904. During World War I, &quot;A2&quot; served on harbour service at Portsmouth. She flooded after running aground in Bomb Ketch Lake in Portsmouth Harbour in January 1920 and was sold for scrap to H. G. Pound of Portsmouth on 22 October 1925.

<text>The Senate of the Republic (), or simply the Senate (, ), is the upper house of the bicameral Italian Parliament, the lower house being the Chamber of Deputies. The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. Pursuant to the Articles 57, 58, and 59 of the Italian Constitution, the Senate has 200 elective members, of which 196 are elected from Italian constituencies, and 4 from Italian citizens living abroad. Furthermore, a small number (currently 5) serve as senators for life (&quot;senatori a vita&quot;), either appointed or &quot;ex officio&quot;. It was established in its current form on 8 May 1948, but previously existed during the Kingdom of Italy as &quot;Senato del Regno&quot; (Senate of the Kingdom), itself a continuation of the &quot;Senato Subalpino&quot; (Subalpine Senate) of Sardinia established on 8 May 1848. Members of the Senate are styled &quot;Senator&quot; or &quot;The Honourable Senator&quot; (Italian: &quot;Onorevole Senatore&quot;) and they meet at Palazzo Madama, Rome.

== Composition ==

Article 57 of the Constitution of Italy originally established that the Senate of the Republic was to be elected on a regional basis by Italian citizens aged 25 or older (unlike the Chamber of the Deputies, which was elected on a national basis and by all Italian citizens aged 18 or older). No region could have less than 7 senators, except for the two smallest regions: Aosta Valley (1 senator) and Molise (2 senators). From 2006 to 2020, 6 out of 315 senators (and 12 out of 630 deputies) were elected by Italians residing abroad.

After two constitutional amendments were passed respectively in 2020 (by constitutional referendum) and 2021, however, there have been changes. The Senate is still elected on a regional basis, but the number of senators was reduced from 315 to 200, who are now elected by all citizens aged 18 or older, just like deputies (themselves being reduced from 630 to 400). 

Italians residing abroad now elect 4 senators (and 8 deputies). The remaining 196 senators are assigned to each region proportionally according to their population. The amended Article 57 of the Constitution provides that no region can have fewer than 3 senators representing it, barring Aosta Valley and Molise, which retained 1 and 2 senators respectively.

The senators for life are either former presidents of the Italian Republic who hold office &quot;ex officio&quot; or one of up to five citizens who are appointed by presidents of Italy &quot;for outstanding merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field&quot;. The current life senators are:

The current term of the Senate is five years, except for senators for life that hold their office for their lifetime. Until a Constitutional change on 9 February 1963, the Senate was elected for six-year terms. The Senate may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term by the president of the Republic (e.g. when no government can obtain a majority).

=== Electoral system and election of the Senate ===

According to article 58 of the Italian constitution, Italian citizens aged 18 onwards (until 2021 25 years) are enabled to vote for the Senate.

The electoral system is a parallel voting system, with 37% of seats allocated using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP) and 63% using proportional representation, allocated with the largest remainder method, with one round of voting.

*The 200 elected senators are elected in:
** 74 in single-member constituencies, by plurality;
** 122 in multi-member constituencies, by regional proportional representation;
** 4 in multi-member abroad constituencies, by constituency proportional representation.

For Italian residents, each house members are elected by single ballots, including the constituency candidate and his/her supporting party lists. In each single-member constituency the deputy/senator is elected on a plurality basis, while the seats in multi-member constituencies will be allocated nationally. In order to be calculated in single-member constituency results, parties need to obtain at least 1% of the national vote. In order to receive seats in multi-member constituencies, parties need to obtain at least 3% of the national vote. Elects from multi-member constituencies will come from closed lists. The single voting paper, containing both first-past-the-post candidates and the party lists, shows the names of the candidates to single-member constituencies and, in close conjunction with them, the symbols of the linked lists for the proportional part, each one with a list of the relative candidates.

Voters can cast their votes in three different ways:

* Drawing a sign on the symbol of a list: in this case the vote extends to the candidate in the single-member constituency which is supported by that list.
* Drawing a sign on the name of the candidate of the single-member constituency and another one on the symbol of one list that supports them: the result is the same as that described above; it is not allowed, under penalty of annulment, the panachage, so the voter can not vote simultaneously for a candidate in the FPTP constituency and for a list which is not linked to them.
* Drawing a sign only on the name of the candidate for the FPTP constituency, without indicating any list: in this case, the vote is valid for the candidate in the single-member constituency and also automatically extended to the list that supports them; if that candidate is however connected to several lists, the vote is divided proportionally between them, based on the votes that each one has obtained in that constituency.

== Reform proposals ==
In 2016, the Italian Parliament passed a constitutional law that &quot;effectively abolishes the Senate as an elected chamber and sharply restricts its ability to veto legislation&quot;. The law was rejected on 4 December 2016 by a referendum, leaving the Senate unchanged.

== Membership ==

The membership of the Senate following the 2022 Italian general election:


==Presidents==

Under the current Constitution, the Senate must hold its first sitting no later than 20 days after a general election. That session, presided by the oldest senator, proceeds to elect the president of the Senate for the following parliamentary period. On the first two attempts at voting, an absolute majority of all senators is needed; if a third round is needed, a candidate can be elected by an absolute majority of the senators present and voting. If this third round fails to produce a winner, a final ballot is held between the two senators with the highest votes in the previous ballot. In the case of a tie, the elder senator is deemed the winner.

In addition to overseeing the business of the chamber, chairing and regulating debates, deciding whether motions and bills are admissible, representing the Senate, etc., the president of the Senate stands in for the president of the Republic when the latter is unable to perform the duties of the office; in this case the Senate is headed by a vice president.

The current president of the Senate is Ignazio La Russa.
== Historical composition ==

=== Since 1994 ===


==Palazzo Madama==
Since 1871, the Senate has met in Palazzo Madama in Rome, an old patrician palace completed in 1505 for the Medici family. The palace takes its name from &quot;Madama&quot; Margherita of Austria, daughter of Charles V and wife of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici. After the extinction of the Medici, the palace was handed over to the House of Lorraine. and, later, it was sold to Papal Government.

Later, in 1755, Pope Benedict XIV (whose coat of arms still dominates the main entrance) ordered major restructuring, entrusting the work to Luigi Hostini. In the following years there were installed the court offices and police headquarters. In 1849, Pius IX moved the Ministries of Finances and of the Public Debt here, as well as the Papal Post Offices. After the conquest of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, the palace was chosen to become the seat of the &quot;Senato del Regno&quot; (Senate of the Kingdom).

Palazzo Madama and the adjacent buildings underwent further restructuring and adaptation in the first decades of the 20th century. A radical transformation which involved, among other things, the modernization of the hemicycle, the full remaking of the prospectus on Via San Salvatore and Via Dogana Vecchia, and the establishment of a connection with the adjacent Palazzo Carpegna. The latter, owned by the Senate, was entirely rebuilt in an advanced position compared to its original position. The small church of San Salvatore in Thermis, dating to the 6th century, which stood in the street to the left of the palace, was first closed, expropriated and later razed for security reasons.

The current façade was built in the mid-1650s by both Cigoli and Paolo Maruccelli. The latter added the ornate cornice and whimsical decorative urns on the roof. Among the rooms one of the most significant (and perhaps the most impressive from the political point of view) is the &quot;Sala Maccari,&quot; which takes its name from Cesare Maccari, the artist who decorated it in 1880 and created the frescoes, among which stands out the one that depicts Cicero making his indictment of Catiline, who listens isolated.

The chamber where the Senate met for the first time on 27 November 1871 was designed by Luigi Gabet. A plaque on the wall behind the speaker&#x27;s chair commemorates the king&#x27;s address to Parliament when first convened in the new seat of government:
Above this has been placed a plaque bearing the inscription:
To the viewers&#x27; left stand the flags of the Italian Republic (with a ribbon embroidered with the words SENATO DELLA REPUBBLICA) and the European Union.

<text>Albert Préfontaine (October 11, 1861 – February 21, 1935) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as leader of the Manitoba Conservatives in the late 1910s, and was subsequently a member of the United Farmers of Manitoba.

Born in Upton, Canada East (now Quebec), the son of Firmin Prefontaine and Mathilde (Mathilda) Desautels, Préfontaine was educated in Greenfield, Massachusetts. He subsequently moved to Manitoba in 1880, where he worked as a farmer and store manager and served as Reeve of the Municipality of De Salaberry from 1892 to 1896. In 1888, he married Albina L&#x27;Heureux. Préfontaine was president of the Carillon Agricultural Society, of the Carey Elevator Company and of the St. Pierre Trading Company.

Préfontaine was first elected to the provincial parliament in 1903, running for Rodmond Roblin&#x27;s governing Conservatives in the francophone riding of Carillon. He was re-elected in 1907 and 1910.

In 1914, Préfontaine lost his seat to Liberal Thomas Molloy by seven votes. He was re-elected the following year, despite the disastrous showing of the Conservatives in the rest of the province. His victory may be credited to the fact that the provincial Conservatives were seen as more supportive of francophone rights than were Tobias Norris&#x27;s Liberals (indeed, Norris&#x27; government withdrew state funding for French-language education soon after the election).

Conservative leader James Aikins lost his seat in the 1915 election, and Préfontaine was chosen to lead the small opposition caucus in parliament (he was sworn in as leader of the opposition in January 1916). He declined to be a candidate in the party&#x27;s leadership convention, held on November 6, 1919.

Although it had been in government from 1900 to 1915, the Conservative Party of Manitoba was marginalized by developments in the later half of the 1910s. Increasingly radicalized farmer and labour groups were forming political organizations of their own, and the old divisions between Grit and Tory no longer seemed as relevant. The Conservatives again fared poorly in the election of 1920, and Préfontaine was personally defeated by Farmer candidate Maurice Duprey.

After this loss, Préfontaine detached himself from the Conservative Party. He ran as an Independent in the federal election of 1921, losing to Progressive candidate Arthur-Lucien Beaubien in the Provencher riding, and subsequently left the Conservatives to join the United Farmers of Manitoba. Running as a UFM candidate, he was re-elected for Carillon in 1922.

On December 3, 1923, Premier John Bracken appointed Préfontaine to the high-level cabinet positions of Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Railway Commissioner. Préfontaine also became Minister of Agriculture in 1925. In the 1927 election, he defeated his old nemesis Thomas Molloy by a landslide.

Préfontaine stood down as Provincial Secretary, Provincial Lands Commissioner and Minister of Agriculture in 1928, though he retained the Railway Commissioner&#x27;s position until 1932. He was re-elected in that year&#x27;s general election, and continued to serve the Franco-Manitoban community as a Minister without Portfolio until his death in 1935.

Préfontaine&#x27;s career reveals the continued importance of the francophone community to Manitoba politics, even after immigration from Ontario and Eastern Europe had significantly reduced their relative strength. His decision to join the UFM was indicative of a larger cultural change, as Franco-Manitobans became an important part of the Progressive Party of Manitoba during its long period in government.

His son Edmond also served in the Manitoba assembly.

The resort community of Albert Beach, Manitoba (&quot;French&quot;: &quot;Plage Albert&quot;) was named after him.

<text>A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a subdivision of England used for local government.

The non-metropolitan counties were originally created in 1974 as part of a reform of local government in England and Wales, and were the top tier of a two-tier system of counties and districts. 21 non-metropolitan counties still use a two-tier system; 56 are unitary authorities, in which the functions of a county and district council have been combined in a single body. Berkshire has a unique structure.

Non-metropolitan counties cover the majority of England with the exception of Greater London, the Isles of Scilly, and the six metropolitan counties: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire.

The non-metropolitan counties are all part of ceremonial counties. Some ceremonial counties, such as Norfolk, contain a single non-metropolitan county, but many contain more than one and it is also common for ceremonial counties and non-metropolitan counties to share a name. Lancashire, for example, contains the non-metropolitan counties of Lancashire, Blackpool, and Blackburn with Darwen.

==Origins==
Prior to 1974 local government had been divided between single-tier county boroughs (the largest towns and cities) and two-tier administrative counties which were subdivided into municipal boroughs and urban and rural districts. The Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, divided England outside Greater London and the six largest conurbations into thirty-nine non-metropolitan counties. Each county was divided into anywhere between two and fourteen non-metropolitan districts. There was a uniform two-tier system of local government with county councils dealing with &quot;wide-area&quot; services such as education, fire services and the police, and district councils exercising more local powers over areas such as planning, housing and refuse collection.

As originally constituted, the non-metropolitan counties were largely based on existing counties, although they did include a number of innovations. Some counties were based on areas surrounding large county boroughs or were formed by the mergers of smaller counties. Examples of the first category are Avon (based on Bath and Bristol) and Cleveland (based on Teesside). An example of the second category is Cumbria, formed by the merger between Cumberland and Westmorland. The counties were adopted for all statutory purposes: a lord-lieutenant and high sheriff was appointed to each county, and they were also used for judicial administration, and definition of police force areas. The Royal Mail adopted the counties for postal purposes in most areas.

==Changes==
===1995–1998===
A Local Government Commission was appointed in 1992 to review the administrative structure of the non-metropolitan counties. It was anticipated that a system of unitary authorities would entirely replace the two-tier system. The Commission faced competing claims from former county boroughs wishing to regain unitary status and advocates for the restoration of such small counties as Herefordshire and Rutland. The review led to the introduction of unitary local government in some areas but not in others. In the majority of unitary authorities an existing district council took over powers from the county council. The 1972 Act required that all areas outside Greater London form part of a non-metropolitan county, and that all such counties should contain at least one district. Accordingly, the statutory instruments that effected the reorganisation separated the unitary districts from the county in which they were situated and constituted them as counties. The orders also provided that the provisions of the 1972 Act that every county should have a county council should not apply in the new counties, with the district council exercising the powers of the county council.

An exception was made in the case of Berkshire, which was retained with its existing boundaries in spite of the abolition of its county council and the creation of six unitary authorities. This was done in order to preserve its status as a royal county.

With the creation of numerous new non-metropolitan counties, the areas used for lieutenancy and shrievalty began to diverge from local government areas. This led to the development of ceremonial counties for these purposes, a fact recognised by the Lieutenancies Act 1997.

===2009===
A further wave of unitary authorities were created in 2009 under the terms of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. While a number of new counties were created, several of the new authorities (such as Cornwall or Northumberland) continued to have the boundaries set in 1974.

===2019–2023===
The 2019–2023 structural changes to local government in England have involved changes to the non-metropolitan county of Dorset (2019), and the abolition of the non-metropolitan counties Northamptonshire (2021) and Cumbria (2023). In addition, the non-metropolitan counties of Buckinghamshire (2020), North Yorkshire (2023), and Somerset (2023) are unchanged, but their councils became unitary authorities as the existing non-metropolitan districts in these areas were consolidated and the district councils abolished.

==List of non-metropolitan counties==
The following list shows the original thirty-nine counties formed in 1974, subsequent changes in the 1990s, and further changes since then.
: Current
: Planned abolition
: Abolished non-metropolitan county
: Abolished non-metropolitan county and associated ceremonial county
==Wales==
In Wales there was no distinction between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties: all upper tier areas were designated &quot;counties&quot;. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 amended the 1972 Act, abolishing the Welsh counties and creating instead new Welsh principal areas, some of which are also designated &quot;counties&quot;. For the purposes of lieutenancy the counties constituted in 1974 were preserved.

<doc id="852687" wikidata="Q1008589" url="?curid=852687" title="Plasy">
<text>Plasy (; ) is a town in Plzeň-North District in the Plzeň Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 3,000 inhabitants. It is known for its former monastery of the same name, which is protected as a national cultural monument.

==Administrative division==
Plasy consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Plasy (1,891)
*Babina (214)
*Horní Hradiště (168)
*Lomnička (80)
*Nebřeziny (179)
*Žebnice (158)
==Geography==
Plasy is located about north of Plzeň. It lies in the Plasy Uplands. The highest point is the hill Spálená hora at above sea level. The Střela River flows through the town.

==History==

The foundation of the town is connected with the foundation of the Cistercian monastery. The Plasy Monastery was founded in 1144 by then Prince Vladislaus II. The monastery experienced the greatest development during the reign of King Wenceslaus I, and its property gradually grew to cover 50 surrounding villages. The development of the monastery ended during the Hussite Wars, when it was burned down in 1421.

The entire 15th and 16th centuries mean a period of deep decline. After the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, the monastery&#x27;s financial situation improved, most of it former properties were returned to it, and the construction of new buildings on the monastery grounds began.

The monastery was abolished in 1785 by decree of Emperor Joseph II. In 1826, the monastery building with the whole estate was purchased by Klemens von Metternich, who is buried here in the family tomb.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Plasy is located on the railway line heading from Plzeň to Žihle and Most.

==Sights==
The monastery complex is the most significant landmark of Plasy, protected as a national cultural monument. It contains the former monastery, Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, Baroque granary with the Royal Chapel of Saints Wenceslaus and Mary Magdalene, and abbot&#x27;s residence. In 1661–1666, the church was rebuilt in the early Baroque style. The new convent building was built in 1711–1740 by Jan Santini Aichel and after his death by Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. Today the complex is open to the public and offers guided tours.

The former Church of Saint Wenceslaus was built in the Gothic style and rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1690. After the abolition of the monastery, it was modified into the family tomb of the Metternich family.

==Notable people==
*Mauritius Vogt (1669–1730), German geographer, historian, cartographer and musician; lived here
*Klemens von Metternich (1773–1859), Austrian diplomat and politician
*Václav Levý (1820–1870), sculptor
*Viktor Stretti (1878–1957), painter
*Rudolf Jung (1882–1945), German Nazi ideologue
*Jiří Kornatovský (born 1952), painter

<doc id="852688" wikidata="Q1753294" url="?curid=852688" title="Zerah Colburn (mental calculator)">
<text>Zerah Colburn (September 1, 1804 – March 2, 1839) was an American child prodigy of the 19th century who gained fame as a mental calculator.

==Biography==
Colburn was born in Cabot, Vermont, in 1804. He was thought to be intellectually disabled until the age of six. However, after six weeks of schooling, his father overheard him repeating his multiplication tables. His father was not sure whether or not he learned the tables from his older brothers and sisters, but he decided to test him further on his mathematical abilities and discovered that there was something special about his son when Zerah correctly multiplied 13 and 97.

Colburn&#x27;s abilities developed rapidly and he was soon able to solve such problems as the number of seconds in 2,000 years, the product of 12,225 and 1,223, or the square root of 1,449. When he was seven years old he took six seconds to give the numbers of hours in thirty-eight years, two months, and seven days.

Zerah was reported to have been able to solve fairly complex problems. For example, the sixth Fermat number is 225+1 (or 232+1). The question is whether this number, 4,294,967,297, is prime or not. Zerah calculated in his head that it was not and had a divisor of 641. (Its other proper divisor is 6,700,417).

His father capitalized on his boy&#x27;s talents by taking Zerah around the country and eventually abroad, demonstrating the boy&#x27;s exceptional abilities. The two left Vermont in the winter of 1810–11. Passing through Hanover, New Hampshire, John Wheelock, then president of Dartmouth College, offered to take upon himself the whole care and expense of his education, but his father rejected the offer. At Boston, the boy&#x27;s performances attracted much attention. He was visited by Harvard College professors and eminent people from all professions, and the newspapers ran numerous articles concerning his powers of computation.

After leaving Boston, his father exhibited Zerah for money throughout the middle and part of the southern states and, in January 1812, sailed with him for England. In September 1813 Colburn was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was pitted against the eight-year-old William Rowan Hamilton in a mental arithmetic contest, with Colburn emerging the clear victor. In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less time to studying languages and more time to studying mathematics. After traveling over England, Scotland, and Ireland, they spent 18 months in Paris. Here Zerah was placed in the Lycée Napoléon but was soon removed by his father, who at length in 1816 returned to England in deep poverty.

The Earl of Bristol soon became interested in the boy, and placed him in Westminster School, where he remained until 1819. In consequence of his father&#x27;s refusal to comply with certain arrangements proposed by the earl, Zerah was removed from Westminster, and his father then proposed to Zerah that he should study to become an actor. Accordingly, he studied for this profession and for a few months was under the tuition of Charles Kemble. His first appearance, however, dissatisfied both his instructor and himself so much that he was not accepted for the stage, so he accepted a position as an assistant in a school, and soon afterward commenced a school of his own. To this he added the performing of some astronomical calculations for Thomas Young, then secretary of the Board of Longitude.

In 1824 when his father died, he was enabled by the Earl of Bristol and other friends to return to the United States. Though Zerah&#x27;s schooling was rather irregular, he showed talent in languages. He went to Fairfield, New York, as assistant teacher of an academy; not being pleased with his situation, he moved in March following to Burlington, Vermont, where he taught French, pursuing his studies at the same time at the University of Vermont. Toward the end of 1825 he connected himself with the Methodist Church and, after nine years of service as an itinerant preacher, settled in Norwich, Vermont, in 1835, where he was soon after appointed professor of languages at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

In 1833 Colburn published his autobiography. From this it appears that his faculty of computation left him about the time he reached adulthood. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 34 and was buried in Norwich&#x27;s Old Meeting House Cemetery.

==Family==
His nephew, also named Zerah Colburn, was a noted locomotive engineer and technical journalist.

<doc id="852690" wikidata="Q1479472" url="?curid=852690" title="Black coral">
<text>Antipatharians, also known as black corals or thorn corals, are an order of soft deep-water corals. These corals can be recognized by their jet-black or dark brown chitin skeletons, which are surrounded by their colored polyps (part of coral that is alive). Antipatharians are a cosmopolitan order, existing in nearly every oceanic location and depth, with the sole exception of brackish waters. However, they are most frequently found on continental slopes under deep. A black coral reproduces both sexually and asexually throughout its lifetime. Many black corals provide housing, shelter, food, and protection for other animals.

Black corals were originally classified in the subclass Ceriantipatharia along with ceriantharians (tube-dwelling anemones), but were later reclassified under Hexacorallia. Though they have historically been used by Pacific Islanders for medical treatment and in rituals, its only modern use is making jewelry. Black corals have been declining in numbers and are expected to continue declining due to the effects of poaching, ocean acidification and climate change.

==Etymology==
Despite its name, a black coral is rarely black, and depending on the species can be white, red, green, yellow, or brown. The corals derive their name from their black skeletons, which are composed of protein and chitin. Black corals are also known as thorn corals due to the microscopic spines lining their skeletons.

The name Antipatharia comes from the Ancient Greek word (&quot;against disease&quot;). In the Hawaiian language, a black coral is called (&quot;hard bush growing in the sea&quot;); it is the official state gem of Hawaii. In Malay, the corals are called (&quot;root of the sea&quot;), likely named for their tendency to grow at low-light depths.

==Taxonomy and classification==
Black corals have historically been difficult to classify due to poor-quality specimens. They have few distinguishing morphological characteristics, and the few that there are vary across species, similar to other corals. When black corals were first documented by Henri Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, two French zoologists in 1857, all species of Antipatharia were placed in the family Antipathidae. From 2001 to 2006, marine biologists Dennis Opresko and Tina Molodtsova helped transform the taxonomic system into what it is today. A 2007 phylogenetic study confirmed the new taxonomic system.

Blacks corals are classified in the order Antipatharia with 7 families, 44 genera, and 280 distinct species. The families are Antipathidae, Aphanipathidae, Cladopathidae, Leiopathidae, Myriopathidae, Schizopathidae, and Stylopathidae. Black corals can be distinguished from other corals by their black, flexible skeletons and near-total lack of any kind of protection from sediment. All black corals have small or medium-sized polyps and a chitin skeleton, lined with small spines.

==Physical characteristics==
The skeletons of these corals grow in many patterns unique to this order, such as whips, trees, fans, or coils. These range in size from , though polyps can be as small as in size. Skeletons are also lined with tiny spikes. These spikes are roughly in size, and vary widely in terms of size, length, proportion, and sharpness. A layer of &quot;bark&quot; forms around the skeleton as the coral grows. The polyps that live inside this bark are less than and are gelatinous and have six tentacles (the same as hard corals and unlike soft corals, which have eight). These polyps can be nearly any color. Some corals also have &quot;sweeper tentacles&quot;, which can grow up to long. Though individual polyps are either male or female, entire colonies are typically hermaphroditic.

Unlike the vast majority of other corals, black corals have no protection against abrasive materials such as sand and rocks and lack muscular development which can help the corals to hide. These factors can lead to sediment tearing the soft tissue, resulting in death. In response, corals live near crevices, which allows much of their body to be protected.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===

Black corals occur throughout all the oceans from the surface down to the deep-sea, though nearly 75% of species are only found at depths below . The sole oceanic area in which black corals have not been found are brackish waters, though they can inhabit areas with decreased salinity. Black corals are found on reefs, and may contribute to overall reef building, but are also often found as solitary colonies on isolated outcroppings. Most individuals require a hard surface for attachment. They will frequently grow where undersea currents flow, which allows them to feed on the meiofauna that is swept by. Since undersea currents benefit the corals, they will often grow on or by geographic structures that cause currents, such as continental slopes, cliffs, caves, or undersea plateaus. Species distributions of black corals are poorly understood, and while many deep sea black corals have large distributions, more recent work has indicated that shallow black coral species—such as &quot;Antipathes grandis&quot;—can be found spanning from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean.

===Diet===
Black corals are carnivorous, with the coral&#x27;s polyps allowing it to feed mostly on meiofauna such as zooplankton. The polyps of cnidarians have an oral disk in their center which serves as the mouth for the coral. The disk is surrounded by the tentacles, which stings and digests food. The reason many corals are fan-shaped is to catch meiofauna. Many corals only have polyps on the downstream side of the coral, allowing them to catch nearly the same number of animals without wasting energy keeping unnecessary polyps alive.
===Predators===
Vertebrate predation is not a major threat to black corals. There are rare reports of parrotfish and butterflyfish gnawing and eating at the polyps of black corals, but even if a polyp is gnawed off, it will not affect the coral as a whole. The skeleton of a black coral is hard and inert, due to its composition of protein and chitin, making it nearly inedible. Though black coral skeletons have been found in the stomachs of green sea turtles and sharks, these incidents are rare; it has thus been suggested that black corals are not a major part of any vertebrate diets.

However, invertebrates such as muricids and ovulids feed on black corals and similar corals regularly. These mollusks mimic the polyps that the coral typically feeds on and is taken inside of the coral. They will then consume the polyps from the inside out. Various mollusks, such as &quot;Coralliophila kaofitorum&quot; and &quot;Phenacovolva carneptica&quot; live solely where various species of black corals are found, suggesting that they prey exclusively on the species.

===Interactions===
Black corals around the world provide a unique environment for crustaceans, bivalves, and fish. Some species, such as &quot;Dascyllus albisella&quot; and &quot;Centropyge potteri&quot; inhabit specific coral trees. Due to this abundance of species, nighttime predation around the coral beds has been observed.

==Life cycle and reproduction==
Due to the slow life cycle and deep-water habitats of black coral, little is known about their life cycle and reproduction. As with other cnidarians, the life cycle of these corals involves both asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction (also known as budding), is the first method of reproduction used by a black coral during their lifespan. Once a polyp is anchored, it builds a colony by creating a skeleton, growing new branches and making it thicker, similar to the growth of a tree. This method of growing creates &quot;growth rings&quot; which can be used to estimate the age of a colony. Asexual reproduction can also occur if a branch breaks off and a replacement is needed. Though light is not required for growth or development, mature colonies will grow towards light. Why they do so is unknown.
Sexual reproduction in these corals remains largely unstudied. It occurs after the coral colony is established; a colony will produce eggs and sperm, which meet in the water to create larvae that use currents to disperse and settle in new areas. The larval stage of the coral, called a planula, will drift along until it finds a surface on which it can grow. Once it settles, it metamorphoses into its polyp form and creates skeletal material to attach itself to the seafloor. It will then begin to bud, which will create new polyps and eventually form a colony. In areas with ideal conditions, black coral colonies can grow to be extremely dense, creating beds. In some black corals that have been closely examined, colonies will grow roughly every year. Sexual reproduction occurs after 10 to 12 years of growth; the colony will then reproduce annually for the rest of its life. The male to female polyp ratio is 1:1, with females producing anywhere from 1.2 million to 16.9 million oocytes. A large tall coral tree is somewhere between 30 and 40 years old.

The estimated natural lifespan of a black coral colony in the epipelagic zone is 70 years. However, in March 2009 around 4,265 years old specimens of &quot;Leiopathes glaberrima&quot; were found at depths of nearly , making them some of the oldest living organisms on earth. The researchers showed that the &quot;individual colony longevities are on the order of thousands of years.&quot; Rarely, black corals will grow too large to support their own weight, and collapse.
==Human use and harvesting==

Black corals have historically been associated with mystical and medicinal properties in Indonesian, Chinese, and Hawaiian culture. More recent harvesting has been for use as jewelry. Many Indo-Pacific peoples believed that black coral has curative and anti-evil powers and made them into necklace and bracelets; however, black corals are not ideal for jewelry-making due to it being soft as opposed to stony, causing jewelry made with it to dry out and break. If a real black coral is boiled in milk, it will smell of myrrh; this test can be used to determine if a sample is genuine.

The best studied and regulated black coral fisheries are in Hawaii, where they have been harvested since the 1960s. In the Caribbean harvesting is typically done to produce jewelry for sale to tourists, and has followed a boom-and-bust cycle, where new coral populations are discovered and overexploited leading to rapid declines. For example, Cozumel, Mexico, was famed for dense black coral beds that have been harvested since the 1960s leading to widespread black coral population declines. Despite improvements in management in Cozumel, including no harvesting permits issued since the mid-1990s, the black coral population had failed to recover when assessed in 2016. Though it is illegal to move black corals across international borders without authorization, as they are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), it is still possible to buy them.

Though various methods have been proposed for quicker and more efficient rejuvenation of black coral colonies, none have worked to the point where these corals could be commercially farmed.

==Threats==

Though black corals are not listed on the IUCN Red List, a number of factors threaten them today. The largest single threat is poaching— though the majority of black coral fisheries are heavily regulated, there is still a black market for the corals. Particularly on tropical islands and Madagascar, the market for illegally-harvested black corals is large. Due to overfishing of mature corals, in some areas nearly 90% of corals are juveniles (less than tall.)

Global warming is the primary threat to black corals worldwide, as well as all other corals. Though black corals rarely builds reefs (the most threatened areas), threats caused by climate change such as coral bleaching, rising sea temperatures, changing underwater currents, and changing salinity and pH also affect deep-sea corals. Invasive species such as &quot;Carijoa riisei&quot;, which were introduced to Hawaiian waters by humans, may pose a significant threat to black corals.

<doc id="852692" wikidata="Q1671577" url="?curid=852692" title="Intravascular ultrasound">
<text>Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or intravascular echocardiography is a medical imaging methodology using a specially designed catheter with a miniaturized ultrasound probe attached to the distal end of the catheter. The proximal end of the catheter is attached to computerized ultrasound equipment. It allows the application of ultrasound technology, such as piezoelectric transducer or CMUT, to see from inside blood vessels out through the surrounding blood column, visualizing the endothelium (inner wall) of blood vessels.

The arteries of the heart (the coronary arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS. IVUS is used in the coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. Intravascular ultrasound provides a unique method to study the regression or progression of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. 
The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades leads to the development of unstable vulnerable plaque which can detach as clots leading to strokes and heart attacks. IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with hydraulic angioplasty expansion of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time.

==Advantages over angiography==
Arguably the most valuable use of IVUS is to visualize plaque, which cannot be seen by angiography. Over time this technique has evolved into an extremely useful research tool for modern invasive cardiology, and it has been increasingly used in research to better understand the behavior of the atherosclerosis process in living people.

IVUS enables accurately visualizing not only the lumen of the coronary arteries but also the atheroma (membrane/cholesterol loaded white blood cells) &quot;hidden&quot; within the wall. IVUS has thus enabled advances in clinical research providing a more thorough perspective and better understanding.

In the early 1990s, IVUS research on the re-stenosis problem after angioplasty lead to recognition that most of the re-stenosis problem (as visualized by an angiography examination) was not true re-stenosis. Instead it was simply a remodeling of the atheromatous plaque, which was still protruding into the lumen of the artery after completion of angioplasty; the stenosis only appearing to be reduced because blood and contrast could now flow around and through some of the plaque. The angiographic dye column appeared widened adequately; yet considerable plaque was within the newly widened lumen and the lumen remained partially obstructed. This recognition promoted more frequent use of stents to hold the plaque outward against the inner artery walls, out of the lumen.

Additionally, IVUS examinations, as they were done more frequently, served to reveal and confirm the autopsy research findings of the late 1980s, showing that atheromatous plaque tends to cause expansion of the internal elastic lamina, causing the degree of plaque burden to be greatly underestimated by angiography. Angiography only reveals the edge of the atheroma that protrudes into the lumen.

Perhaps the greatest contribution to understanding, so far, was achieved by clinical research trials completed in the United States in the late 1990s, using combined angiography and IVUS examination, to study which coronary lesions most commonly result in a myocardial infarction. The studies revealed that most myocardial infarctions occur at areas with extensive atheroma within the artery wall, however very little stenosis of the artery opening. The range of lumen stenosis locations at which myocardial infarctions occurred ranged from areas of mild dilation all the way to areas of greater than 95% stenosis. However the average or typical stenosis at which myocardial infarctions occurred were found to be less than 50%, describing plaques long considered insignificant by many. Only 14% of heart attacks occurred at locations with 75% or more stenosis, the &quot;severe&quot; stenoses previously thought by many to present the greatest danger to the individual. This research has changed the primary focus for heart attack prevention from &quot;severe&quot; narrowing to vulnerable plaque.

Current clinical uses of IVUS technology include checking how to treat complex lesions before angioplasty and checking how well an intracoronary stent has been deployed within a coronary artery after angioplasty. If a stent is not expanded flush against the wall of the vessel, turbulent flow may occur between the stent and the wall of the vessel; some fear this might create a nidus for acute thrombosis of the artery.

==Disadvantages versus angiography==
The primary disadvantages of IVUS being used routinely in a cardiac catheterization laboratory are its expense, the increase in the time of the procedure, and the fact that it is considered an interventional procedure, and should only be performed by angiographers that are trained in interventional cardiology techniques. In addition, there may be additional risk imposed by the use of the IVUS catheter.

The computerized IVUS echocardiographic imaging systems list for $120,000, US, 2007 for a cart based system and ~$70,000 for an installed or integrated solution. The disposable catheters used to do each examination typically cost ~$600, US, 2007. In many hospitals, the IVUS system is placed as part of a bundle deal based on minimum disposable sales volumes. In other words, the cost of the console is paid for by rebates from other purchased products including IVUS catheters. Because no standard exists, IVUS catheters cannot be interchanged between different manufacturers.

Additionally, IVUS adds significant additional examination time and some increased risk to the patient beyond performing a standard diagnostic angiographic examination. This increase is significantly less when IVUS is part of a percutaneous coronary intervention, since much of the setup is the same for the intervention as for the IVUS imaging.

IVUS continues to improve and some manufacturers have proposed building IVUS technology into angioplasty and stent balloon catheters, a potential major advance, but limited by complexity, cost and increased bulk of the catheters.

==Comparison versus intravascular optical coherence tomography==
Compared to IVUS, intravascular OCT offers an order of magnitude improved resolution for a better visualization of vessel lumen, tissue microstructure and devices (e.g., intracoronary stents). IVUS offers an improved imaging depth for the assessment of lipid or necrotic plaques, while intravascular OCT offers better penetration and enhanced imaging of calcific tissue. Intravascular OCT requires a short injection of contrast (e.g., 2 to 3 seconds) in a similar way to obtain an angiographic image. IVUS does not require a contrast injection as ultrasounds can penetrate through blood.

==Method==
To visualize an artery or vein, angiographic techniques are used and the physician positions the tip of a guidewire, usually 0.36 mm (0.014&quot;) diameter with a very soft and pliable tip and about 200 cm long. The physician steers the guidewire from outside the body, through angiography catheters and into the blood vessel branch to be imaged.

The ultrasound catheter tip is slid in over the guidewire and positioned, using angiography techniques so that the tip is at the farthest away position to be imaged. The sound waves are emitted from the catheter tip, are usually in the 20-40 MHz range, and the catheter also receives and conducts the return echo information out to the external computerized ultrasound equipment which constructs and displays a real time ultrasound image of a thin section of the blood vessel currently surrounding the catheter tip, usually displayed at 30 frames/second image.

The guide wire is kept stationary and the ultrasound catheter tip is slid backwards, usually under motorized control at a pullback speed of 0.5 mm/s. (The motorized pullback tends to be smoother than hand movement by the physician.)

The (a) blood vessel wall inner lining, (b) atheromatous disease within the wall and (c) connective tissues covering the outer surface of the blood vessel are echogenic, i.e. they return echoes making them visible on the ultrasound display.

By contrast, the blood itself and the healthy muscular tissue portion of the blood vessel wall is relatively echolucent, just black circular spaces, in the images.

Heavy calcium deposits in the blood vessel wall both heavily reflect sound, i.e. are very echogenic, but are also distinguishable by shadowing. Heavy calcification blocks sound transmission beyond and so, in the echo images, are seen as both very bright areas but with black shadows behind (from the vantage point of the catheter tip emitting the ultrasound waves).

==Uses==
IVUS, as outlined above, has been the best technology, so far, to demonstrate the anatomy of the artery wall in living animals and humans. It has led to an explosion of better understanding and research on both (a) the behavior of the atherosclerosis process and (b) the effects of different treatment strategies for changing the evolution of the atherosclerosis disease process. This has been important given that atherosclerosis is the single most frequent disease process for the greatest percentage of individuals living in first world countries.

===Intravascular ultrasound in the coronary anatomy===
While the routine use of IVUS during percutaneous coronary intervention does not improve short term outcomes, there are a number of situations in which IVUS is of particular use in the treatment of coronary artery disease of the heart. In particular in cases when the degree of stenosis of a coronary artery is unclear, IVUS can directly quantify the percentage of stenosis and give insight into the anatomy of the plaque.

One particular use of IVUS in the coronary anatomy is in the quantification of left main disease in cases where routine coronary angiography gives equivocal results. Many studies in the past have shown that significant left main disease can increase mortality, and that intervention (either coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention) to reduce mortality is necessary when the left main stenosis is significant.

When using IVUS to determine whether an individual&#x27;s left main disease is clinically significant, in terms of the desirability of physical intervention, the two most widely used parameters are the degree of stenosis and the minimal lumen area. A cross sectional area of ≤7 mm² in a symptomatic individual or ≤6 mm² in an asymptomatic individual is considered to be clinically significant and warrants intervention to improve one-year mortality. However, these exact cutoffs are up for debate and different cutoff cross-sectional areas may be used in practice depending on differing interpretations of the trial data.

===Validating the efficacy of new treatments===
Because IVUS is widely available in coronary catheterization labs worldwide and can accurately quantify arterial plaque, especially within the coronary arteries, it is increasingly being used to evaluate newer and evolving strategies for the treatment of coronary artery disease, including the statins and other approaches.

<doc id="852693" wikidata="Q1762729" url="?curid=852693" title="Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums">
<text>The Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) was a specialized gang intelligence unit of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) tasked with combating gang-related crime between 1979 and 2000. The unit was established in the South Central district of Los Angeles, California, United States, to combat rising gang violence during the period. Each of the LAPD&#x27;s 18 divisions had a CRASH unit assigned to it, whose primary goal was to suppress gang-related crimes in the city, which came about primarily from the increase in illegal drug trade.

CRASH was subject of the Rampart scandal from 1997, which exposed widespread police corruption within the unit assigned to the LAPD&#x27;s Rampart Division, including involvement in murders, extortion, police brutality, evidence planting, and participating in gang activity. CRASH was disbanded in 2000 and was replaced by the LAPD Gang and Narcotics Division.

==History==
===Establishment===
By 1973, street gangs were quickly becoming a problem in the 77th Street Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), located in the South Central area of Los Angeles, California. Deputy Chief Lou Sporrer, commanding officer of South Bureau, responsible for 77th Street Division operations and ultimately responsible to Chief of Police Edward M. Davis, created a unit of uniformed officers and a plainclothes intelligence section. The two were combined to be identified as 77th Street Division TRASH, an acronym for &quot;Total Resources Against Street Hoodlums&quot; with the idea of demeaning gang activities. Community activists began efforts to abolish the TRASH unit, stating the name itself dehumanizes gang members. Sporrer agreed to a name change, with the &quot;T&quot; for Total becoming a &quot;C&quot; for Community and TRASH became CRASH. In addition to gang-related crime prevention, CRASH officers also had to obtain information about a specific gang that was assigned to them and relay that information between districts. The &quot;freedom of movement and activity&quot; and &quot;gung ho&quot; nature of CRASH officers led some of them to incite controversy among themselves and the whole CRASH unit.

In the 1980s, gang violence began to increase dramatically as a result of the drug trade, specifically the introduction of crack cocaine.

===Operation Hammer===

Operation Hammer was a CRASH-led initiative that began in 1987 to crack down on gang violence in South Central Los Angeles. As a result of increasing gang violence and a drive-by killing resulting in the deaths of seven people, then-Chief of Police Daryl Gates responded by sending CRASH officers to arrest suspected gang members. At the height of this operation in April 1988, 1,453 people were arrested by one thousand police officers in a single weekend. Despite the large number of initial arrests, they only resulted in 60 felony arrests, and charges were only filed in 32 instances. While considered successful by some, this operation and the LAPD were maligned with accusations of racism; some believed that Operation Hammer heavily employed racial profiling, targeting African American and Hispanic youths that were labelled as &quot;urban terrorists&quot; and &quot;ruthless killers.&quot; However, proponents of the operation asserted that it was not discriminatory as all gang members arrested had warrants for their arrests.

===Rampart Division CRASH scandal===

Every LAPD patrol division had a CRASH unit stationed in it. One of the most prominent CRASH units was stationed in the Rampart Division.

On February 26, 1998, Rampart CRASH officer Brian Hewitt was suspended and later stripped of his job when allegations arose of a cover-up of the beating and asphyxiation of Ismail Jiminez. Hewitt was accused of choking Jiminez in an interview room when the suspect refused to provide evidence of gang activities. When Jiminez reported his beating at a hospital, the evidence implicated Hewitt and led to his termination at a Board of Rights hearing.

In August 1998, the same month that Chief Bernard Parks claimed that the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department reforms were &quot;essentially complete&quot;, officer Rafael Pérez, a nine-year LAPD veteran, was arrested on charges of stealing six pounds (2.7 kilograms) of cocaine from the department&#x27;s Property Division. Pérez was initially tried on one count of possession of cocaine for sale, grand theft and forgery each. After a mistrial on December 7 of that year, more reports of cocaine theft by Pérez arose. In September 1999, in exchange for partial immunity from prosecution, he testified about a pattern of abuse and misconduct involving seventy CRASH officers, threatening to overturn thousands of criminal convictions.

As part of his plea bargain, Pérez implicated scores of officers from the Rampart Division&#x27;s anti-gang unit, describing routinely beating gang members, planting evidence on suspects, falsifying reports and covering up unprovoked shootings. As of May 2001, the Rampart investigation had brought fifty-eight officers before an internal administrative board. Of these, twelve were suspended, seven resigned, and five were terminated. Perez confessed to framing Javier Ovando, an 18th Street Gang member, who was shot by Nino Durden and Perez on October 12, 1996. 

Kevin Starr, the State Librarian of California, wrote in his history of California in the 1990s that &quot;CRASH ... became, in effect, the most badass gang in the city.&quot;

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized version of C.R.A.S.H. appears as the main antagonistic faction in the 2004 open world action-adventure video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;. The unit is led by Officers Frank Tenpenny (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and Eddie Pulaski (Chris Penn), who have criminal ties in Los Santos (the in-game version of Los Angeles) and often engage in deals with gangs for personal profit. The unit&#x27;s unofficial motto (&quot;We intimidate those who intimidate others&quot;) is explicitly used by Tenpenny with protagonist Carl Johnson (Young Maylay), whom he blackmails into doing various jobs meant to prevent C.R.A.S.H&#x27;s illicit activities from going public. However, C.R.A.S.H.&#x27;s third member, Jimmy Hernandez (Armando Riesco), eventually decides to do the right thing and report his partners&#x27; illegal activities, causing him to be killed by them. Near the end of the game, Pulaski is killed by Carl, and Tenpenny is arrested for his crimes, but is acquitted in his trial due to an alleged lack of evidence. This enrages the residents of Los Santos, resulting in violence across the city, mirroring the real-life 1992 Los Angeles riots. The riots eventually end after Tenpenny&#x27;s death in a car crash.

The 1988 film &quot;Colors&quot; stars Robert Duvall and Sean Penn as two members of C.R.A.S.H.

Although corruption in L.A.&#x27;s C.R.A.S.H. unit had yet to be exposed when &quot;Training Day&quot; was written, Antoine Fuqua has stated that the emergence of the Rampart scandal in the late 1990s catalyzed the completion of the film. Denzel Washington also grew a beard in order to emulate the appearance of Rafael Pérez, an LAPD narcotics officer involved in multiple scandals.

The police drama series &quot;The Shield&quot; (2002-2008), which revolves around a corrupt anti-gang unit called the Strike Team, is based on the Rampart scandal. Rampart was the original name for the show.

<doc id="852694" wikidata="Q979830" url="?curid=852694" title="Mark Eaton (ice hockey)">
<text>Mark Andrew Eaton (born May 6, 1977) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former defenseman who is the current interim head coach for the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League (AHL). He played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers, Nashville Predators, Pittsburgh Penguins, and New York Islanders. He is the only NHL player to ever come from Delaware. He attended John Dickinson High School in the Wilmington suburbs but played his minor hockey across the state line in Pennsylvania.

==Playing career==

Eaton started his post-secondary competition with the Waterloo Black Hawks of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He was named second team all-USHL, was the league&#x27;s third-leading scoring defenseman and was honored with the Curt Hammer Award as the USHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. Eaton then moved on to the University of Notre Dame of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). In his only season at UND, Eaton was named the CCHA Rookie of the Year after scoring 12 goals with 17 assists for 29 points.

On August 4, 1998, Eaton signed a contract with the Philadelphia Flyers as an undrafted free agent. He made his NHL debut on October 2, 1999, against the Ottawa Senators, becoming the first player from the greater Delaware Valley region to play for the Flyers. Eaton scored his first NHL goal, which was the game-winning goal, on April 8, 2000, against Rob Tallas of the Boston Bruins. He played his first NHL playoff game on April 13 against the Buffalo Sabres.

Eaton was traded from the Flyers to the Nashville Predators on September 29, 2000, for a third round pick. While playing for the Predators in 2003–04, he set the franchise record for plus/minus at +16. He scored a career-high three assists in a 5–3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche on October 25, 2003. On March 3, 2006, Eaton was placed on injured reserve by the Predators with a strained knee injury.

The Pittsburgh Penguins signed Eaton on July 3, 2006, as a free agent. He saw limited time in his first two seasons, suffering with injuries, playing only 71 games between in 2006–07 and 2007–08.

He won the Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009, scoring 4 goals in the playoffs. On March 30, 2009, Eaton was named a nominee for the Bill Masterton Trophy.

He signed with the New York Islanders as a free agent to a two-year contract on July 2, 2010.

On January 22, 2013, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL announced Eaton had signed with the team on a Professional Try Out. He was released in February, and started skating with his former NHL team, the Pittsburgh Penguins. On February 25, the Penguins signed Eaton to a 1-year deal worth $725,000.

==International play==
Eaton played for the United States at the 2001 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships and recorded one goal (the game-winner vs. Finland) and one assist in nine games. He also played for the United States at the 2002 World Championships in Sweden and registered three assists in a 5–2 win vs. Italy.

<doc id="852703" wikidata="Q133447" url="?curid=852703" title="Mycobacterium bovis">
<text>Mycobacterium bovis is a slow-growing (16- to 20-hour generation time) aerobic bacterium and the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle (known as bovine TB). It is related to &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis in humans. &quot;M. bovis&quot; can jump the species barrier and cause tuberculosis-like infection in humans and other mammals.

== Bacterium morphology and staining ==

The bacteria are curved or straight rods. They sometimes form filaments, which fragment into bacilli or cocci once disturbed. In tissues, they form slender rods, straight or curved, or club-shaped.
Short, relatively plump bacilli (rods) in tissue smears, large slender beaded rods in culture. They have no flagella or fimbria, and no capsule.

&quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; group bacteria are 1.0-4.0 μm long by 0.2-0.3 μm wide in tissues. In culture, they may appear as cocci, or as bacilli up to 6-8 μm long.

The bacteria stain Gram-positive, acid-fast. The cell wall contains as high as 60% lipid, giving the mycobacteria their hydrophobic characteristics, slow growth, and resistance to desiccation, disinfectants, acids, and antibodies. (&quot;Mycobacterium&quot; family). They are not easy to stain with aniline dyes; although they are Gram-positive, confirming this may be difficult. Ziehl–Neelsen staining results in stain pink with hot carbol fuscin and then resist decolourisation with 3% hydrochloric acid in 95% alcohol (i.e. they are acid-alcohol fast); following washing, the slide is counterstained with e.g. methylene blue.

They are nonspore-forming.

== Culture and biochemical features ==
===Growth requirements===
&quot;M. bovis&quot; is a facultative intracellular parasite&quot;.&quot; For &quot;in vitro&quot; growth, special culture media are required; for example, Dorset&#x27;s egg medium incorporates egg yolk, phosphate buffer, magnesium salts, and sodium pyruvate; amino acids may be added, but glycerol is not included, as it is inhibitory. It is inhibited by glycerine. Culture generally requires several weeks at 37 °C to reach colonies visible to the unaided human eye. It is strictly aerobic and grows at 37, but not at 25 °C. Optimal growth occurs at 37-38 °C. The species does not reduce nitrate or niacin and is resistant to pyrazinamide. It is sensitive to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid hydrazide.

===Appearance of colonies===
Initially (after 3–4 weeks), its minute, dull flakes, begin to thicken to form dry, irregular masses standing high above the culture medium surface. Eventually, confluent growth is seen over the whole culture surface, forming a rough, waxy blanket, becoming thick and wrinkled and reaching up the sides of the container. Colonies are yellow when first visible, darkening to deep yellow and eventually brick red, if exposed to light. In fluid media, growth is on the surface only, unless a wetting agent (e.g. Tween 80) is added to the medium.

== Cell structure and metabolism ==
&quot;M. bovis&quot; is similar in structure and metabolism to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;. &quot;M. bovis&quot; is a Gram-positive, acid-fast, rod-shaped, aerobic bacterium. Unlike &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;M. bovis&quot; lacks pyruvate kinase activity, due to &quot;pykA &quot;containing a point mutation that affects binding of Mg2+ cofactor. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the final step of glycolysis, the dephosphorylation of phosphorenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Therefore, in &quot;M. bovis&quot;, glycolytic intermediates cannot enter oxidative metabolism. Although no specific studies have been performed, &quot;M. bovis&quot; seemingly must rely on amino acids or fatty acids as an alternative carbon source for energy metabolism.

==Pathogenesis==
During the first half of the 20th century, &quot;M. bovis&quot; is estimated to have been responsible for more losses among farm animals than all other infectious diseases combined. Infection occurs if the bacterium is ingested or inhaled.

&quot;M. bovis&quot; is usually transmitted to humans by consuming raw milk from infected cows, although it can also spread via aerosol droplets. Actual infections in humans are nowadays rare in developed countries, mainly because pasteurisation kills &quot;M. bovis&quot; bacteria in infected milk. In the UK, cattle are tested for the disease as part of an eradication program and culled if they test positive. Such cattle can still enter the human food chain, but only after a meat inspector or a government veterinary surgeon has inspected the carcass and certified that it is fit for human consumption. However, in areas of the developing world where pasteurisation is not routine, &quot;M. bovis&quot; is a relatively common cause of human tuberculosis.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease that affects a broad range of mammalian hosts, including humans, cattle, deer, llamas, pigs, domestic cats, wild carnivores (foxes, coyotes) and omnivores (common brushtail possum, mustelids and rodents); it rarely affects equids or sheep. The disease can be transmitted in several ways; for example, it can be spread in exhaled air, sputum, urine, faeces, and pus, so the disease can be transmitted by direct contact, contact with the excreta of an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols, depending on the species involved.

== Application to biotechnology ==
&quot;M. bovis&quot; is the ancestor of the most widely used vaccine against tuberculosis, &quot;M. bovis&quot; bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) which was isolated after subculturing on glycerine potato medium 230 times during 13 years starting from an initial virulent strain.

==Epidemiology and control==

===Testing===
Skin testing is possible in cattle. Casal &quot;et al.&quot; 2012 tried both recombinant protein and overlapping peptide provocation, finding the peptide test to be less sensitive.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the introduced common brushtail possum is a vector for the spread of &quot;M. bovis&quot;. The Biosecurity Act 1993, which established a national pest-management strategy, is the legislation behind the control of the disease in New Zealand. The Animal Health Board operates a nationwide programme of cattle testing and possum control, with the goal of eradicating &quot;M. bovis&quot; from wild vector species across 2.5 million hectares – or one-quarter – of New Zealand&#x27;s at-risk areas, by 2026, and eventually eradicating the disease entirely.

The TB-free New Zealand programme is regarded as &quot;world-leading&quot;. It has successfully reduced cattle- and deer-herd infection rates from more than 1700 in 1994 to fewer than 100 herds in July 2011. Much of this success can be attributed to sustained cattle controls reducing cross-infection and breaking the disease cycle. For example, at Hohotaka, in New Zealand&#x27;s central North Island, control work from 1988 to 1994 achieved a sustained mean reduction of 87.5% in the density of TB‐infected possums. As expected, annual TB incidence in local cattle herds consequently declined by a similar amount (83.4%).

Possums are controlled through a combination of trapping, ground-baiting, and where other methods are impractical, aerial treatment with 1080 poison.

From 1979 to 1984, possum control was stopped due to lack of funding. From that point until 1994, TB rates in herds steadily increased. The area of New Zealand harbouring TB-infected wild animals expanded from about 10% of the country to 40%.

The fact that possums are such effective transmitters of TB appears to be facilitated by their behaviour once they get the disease.

===United Kingdom===

In the 1930s, 40% of cattle in the UK were infected with &quot;M. bovis&quot;, and 50,000 new cases of human &quot;M. bovis&quot; infection were reported every year. According to DEFRA and the Health Protection Agency, the risk to people contracting TB from cattle in Great Britain would be low.

Badgers (&quot;Meles meles&quot;) were first identified as carriers of &quot;M. bovis&quot; in 1971, but the report of an independent review committee in 1997 (the Krebs Report) concluded: &quot;strong circumstantial evidence [exists] to suggest that badgers represent a significant source of &quot;M. bovis&quot; infection in cattle... [h]owever, the causal link... has not been proven&quot;. In essence, the contribution of badgers &#x27;to the TB problem in British cattle&#x27; was at this point a hypothesis that needed to be tested, according to the report. The subsequent Randomised Badger Culling Trial (designed, overseen and analysed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, or ISG ) examined this hypothesis by conducting a large field trial of widescale (proactive) culling and localised reactive culling (in comparison with areas which received no badger culling). In their final report, the ISG concluded: &quot;First, while badgers are clearly a source of cattle TB, careful evaluation of our own and others&#x27; data indicates that badger culling can make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain. Indeed, some policies under consideration are likely to make matters worse rather than better. Second, weaknesses in cattle-testing regimens mean that cattle themselves contribute significantly to the persistence and spread of disease in all areas where TB occurs, and in some parts of Britain are likely to be the main source of infection. Scientific findings indicate that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone.&quot; On 26 July 2007, the Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Rooker) said, &quot;My Lords, we welcome the Independent Scientific Group&#x27;s final report, which further improves the evidence base. We are carefully considering the issues that the report raises, and will continue to work with industry, government advisers, and scientific experts in reaching policy decisions on these issues.&quot;

In the UK, many other mammals are infected with &quot;M. bovis&quot;, although the frequency of isolation is generally much less than cattle and badgers. In some areas of south-west England, deer, especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour, have been implicated as possible maintenance hosts for transmission of bovine TB

In some localised areas, the risk of transmission to cattle from fallow deer has been argued to be greater than it is from badgers.

One of the reasons that the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs requires infected or suspected cattle to be culled is to meet EU regulations for the export of meat and dairy products to other member states. Meat and dairy products can still be sold in the UK into the human food chain, providing the relevant carcass inspections and milk pasteurisation have been applied.

The Spread of the disease to humans by domestic pets became evident in March 2014 when Public Health England announced two people in England developed bTB infections after contact with a domestic cat. The two human cases were linked to 9 cases of bTB infection in cats in Berkshire and Hampshire in 2013. These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission.

In a 2010 opinion piece in &quot;Trends in Microbiology&quot;, Paul and David Torgerson argued that bovine tuberculosis is a negligible public health problem in the UK, providing milk is pasteurized. Bovine TB is very rarely spread by aerosol from cattle to humans. Therefore, the bovine tuberculosis control programme in the UK in its present form is a misallocation of resources and provides no benefit to society. Indeed, very little evidence exists of a positive cost benefit to the livestock industry, as few studies have been undertaken on the direct costs of bovine TB to animal production. Milk pasteurisation was the single public health intervention that prevented the transmission of bovine TB to humans, and no justification for the present test and cull policy in the UK is seen.

In July 2010, the second issue of the discussion document &quot;Bovine TB, Time for a Rethink&quot; was published by Rethink Bovine TB, an independent research group. The paper considers current policy in England and Wales. It proposes an alternative solution that is both practical and cost-effective. In the paper, evidence is drawn from DEFRA and the work by Professors Paul and David Torgerson.

In March 2012, think tank the Bow Group published a target paper urging the government to reconsider its plans to cull thousands of badgers to control bovine TB, stating that the findings of Labour&#x27;s major badger-culling trials several years prior were that culling does not work. The paper was authored by Graham Godwin-Pearson with a foreword by singer Brian May and contributions by leading tuberculosis scientists, including Lord Krebs.

In 2017, Rachel Tanner and Helen McShane, of the Jenner Institute, Oxford, published research on replacing, reducing, and refining the use of animals in tuberculosis vaccine research.

Cattle can be vaccinated against TB using the BCG vaccine used to immunise humans. This is not currently done in the UK because the vaccine causes false positives for the current tuberculin test. A new skin test has been developed – Detect Infected among Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) – and phase 1 trials were completed in 2022.

===United States===
According to Barbara Gutmann Rosenkrantz, the late 19th-century discovery of the relationship between bovine and human tuberculosis led to state and federal attempts to stamp out bovine tuberculosis. The campaigns for clean milk and meat frightened city people into supporting controls, although at the time, little evidence showed that tuberculosis was spread to humans through infected meat or milk. The campaigns against impure meat and milk led to tension between the developing veterinarian profession and the medical profession, each claiming that area as part of their expertise.

By 1917, 5% of American cattle were infected with &quot;M. bovis&quot; (bovine tuberculosis or bTB), including 10% of dairy animals and 1–2% of beef cattle. The rates were going up. Around 1900, 15,000 Americans, mostly children, died each year from bTB, and many more suffered pain and disfigurement.
Threatened by a sales cutoff ordered by urban public health officials, Vermont state government officials launched an innovative eradication campaign against bTB on farms, from 1877 to 1936. They made use of the latest German research and thereby kept the New York City and Boston markets. Vermont was exceptional, for across the country many farmers strenuously resisted bovine tuberculosis eradication as an expensive violation of their libertarian right to farm.

In recent decades, &quot;M. bovis&quot; infections in cattle herds in the United States are not common. &quot;M. bovis&quot; is endemic in white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) in the northeastern portion of Michigan and northern Minnesota, and sporadically imported from Mexico. Only the white-tailed deer has been confirmed as a maintenance host in the Michigan outbreak of bTB, although other mammals such as raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), opossums (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), and coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) can serve as spill-over and dead-end hosts. The fact that white-tailed deer are a maintenance host for &quot;M. bovis&quot; remains a significant barrier to the US nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters harvested around 489,922 white-tailed deer in an attempt to control the disease&#x27;s spread. These hunters purchased more than 1.5 million deer-harvest tags. The economic value of deer hunting to Michigan&#x27;s economy in the drive to eradicate TB is substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507 million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan.

===Global===
The disease is found in cattle throughout the globe, but some countries have been able to reduce or limit the incidence of the disease through a process of &quot;test and cull&quot; of the cattle stock. Most of Europe and several Caribbean countries (including Cuba) are virtually free of &quot;M. bovis&quot;. Australia is officially disease-free since the successful BTEC program, but residual infections might exist in feral water buffalo in isolated parts of the Northern Territory. In Canada, affected wild elk and white-tailed deer are found in and around Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba. To improve control and eliminate bTB, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has split Manitoba into two management areas: The Riding Mountain TB eradication area, where the disease has been found, and the Manitoba TB Eradication Area, the rest of the province outside RMEA where the disease has not been found. The disease has also been found in African buffalo in South Africa.

&quot;M. bovis&quot; can be transmitted from human to human; an outbreak occurred in Birmingham, England, in 2004, and from human to cattle, but such occurrences are rare.

In Mexico, the disease is prevalent and rising among humans.

== Zoonotic tuberculosis ==
The infection of humans with &quot;M. bovis&quot; is referred to as zoonotic tuberculosis. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union), published the first Roadmap for Zoonotic Tuberculosis, recognizing zoonotic tuberculosis as a prominent global health problem. The main route of transmission is through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, although transmission via inhalation and consumption of poorly cooked meat has also been reported. In 2018, based on the most recent Global Tuberculosis Report, an estimated 142,000 new cases of zoonotic tuberculosis, and 12,500 deaths due to the disease occurred. Cases of zoonotic tuberculosis have been reported in Africa, the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific. Human zoonotic tuberculosis cases are linked to the presence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle, and regions without adequate disease control measures and/or disease surveillance are at higher risk. It is difficult to clinically distinguish zoonotic tuberculosis from tuberculosis caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; in people, and the current most commonly used diagnostics cannot effectively distinguish between &quot;M. bovis&quot; and &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, which contributes to an underestimation of total cases worldwide. Controlling this disease requires animal health, food safety, and human health sectors to work together under a One Health approach (multi-disciplinary collaborations to improve the health of animals, people, and the environment).

The 2017 Roadmap identified ten priority areas for addressing zoonotic tuberculosis, which includes collecting more accurate data, improving diagnostics, closing research gaps, improving food safety, reducing &quot;M. bovis&quot; in animal populations, identifying risk factors for transmission, increasing awareness, developing policies, implementing interventions, and increasing investments. To align with goals outlined in the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB 2016-2020, The Roadmap outlines specific milestones and goals to be met within this time frame.

==Treatment==
&quot;M. bovis&quot; is innately resistant to pyrazinamide, so the standard human treatment is isoniazid and rifampicin for 9 months. Most cattle that test positive are killed.

<doc id="852707" wikidata="Q880398" url="?curid=852707" title="Black Mesa (Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico)">
<text>Black Mesa is a mesa located in an area covering parts of the U.S. states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. It extends from Mesa de Maya, Colorado southeasterly crossing into the northeast corner of New Mexico, and ending in the Oklahoma panhandle along the north bank of the Cimarron River at its confluence with the North Carrizo Creek near Kenton. Its highest elevation is in Colorado. The highest point of Black Mesa within New Mexico is . In northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Mesa reaches , the highest point in the state of Oklahoma. The plateau that formed at the top of the mesa has been known as a &quot;geological wonder&quot; of North America. There is abundant wildlife in this shortgrass prairie environment, including mountain lions, butterflies, and the Texas horned lizard. (In Colorado, Black Mesa also refers to a summit in Gunnison County and a mountain pass in Dolores County.)

==History==
The plateau has been home to Plains Indians.

In the late-nineteenth and early twentieth century the area was a hideout for outlaws such as William Coe and Black Jack Ketchum. The outlaws built a fort known as the &quot;Robbers&#x27; Roost&quot;. The stone fort housed a blacksmith shop, gun ports, and a piano. The present-day Oklahoma Panhandle area, which was then considered a no man&#x27;s land, lacked law enforcement agencies and hence the outlaws found it safe to hide in the region. However, as new settlers arrived in the area for copper and coal mining and also for cattle ranching activities by grazing cattle in the mesa region, law enforcement became more effective, and the outlaws were brought under control. In more recent times, at least one person has claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrial aliens at Black Mesa.

==Geography==
The Mesa is situated in Cimarron County in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The Black Mesa plateau is part of the Rocky Mountains and the shortgrass prairie. Some features include the Old Maid Rock, 
and Devil&#x27;s Tombstone. The mesa&#x27;s base includes a escarpment which is parallel with the Dry Cimarron River&#x27;s north bank. Its highest elevation is in Colorado. The highest point of Black Mesa within New Mexico is . In northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma, Black Mesa reaches , the highest point in the state of Oklahoma.

A hiking trail of leads from the preserve to the summit which rises about above the level of the surrounding plains, the Nature Conservancy recommends four hours minimum for a round trip; overnight camping is not permitted.

The mesa&#x27;s highest point within Oklahoma is marked by a granite obelisk, and a visitors&#x27; log.
==Climate==
Black Mesa is not only the highest point in Oklahoma but it is also the driest, harshest and coldest place in the state. A nearby weather station is located in Kenton. 
==Geology==
The visual and map view appearance of Black Mesa is as an &quot;inverted valley&quot; because erosion has removed the relatively soft sedimentary strata from either side of the resistant Raton basalt of the lava which originally had occupied and filled a river valley. The mesa is capped by erosion-resistant basaltic lava formed by a volcanic eruption 3 to 5 million years ago. The lava erupted from a vent in the Raton-Clayton volcanic field in northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado. The volcanic cap to the mesa is thick, long and from 0.5 miles to 8 miles wide, which is to the north-northwest of Oklahoma. The erupting lava filled a stream channel in the Pliocene age Ogallala Formation. During the years since the eruption, the adjacent rock of the Ogallala and older formations have been removed leaving the valley-filling basalt perched atop a long ridge. Strata exposed along the mesa below the basalt and Ogallala include the Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and the Jurassic Morrison Formation.

Beginning in 1935, geologists and paleontologists have searched the mesa&#x27;s outcroppings, finding dinosaur fossils in the Jurassic and Triassic strata. A large quantity of dinosaur bones has been recovered from the Black Mesa locale; totaling over eighteen tonnes. These remains were split between several species, including stegosaurus, camptosaurus, diplodocus, and edmontosaurus. Clear fossil physical evidence, a distinct line of footprints believed to have been made by an allosaurus, has been found juxtaposed with the Carrizo Creek, which runs around the modern-day northern edge of the mesa.

==Protected area==

The mesa lies in the protected area known as the Black Mesa Nature Preserve which was established in 1991, covering . The preserve protects 60% of the area of the mesa peak. The peak is accessible along an trail.

Apart from the nature reserve, there is also the Black Mesa State Park encompassing , with a lake known as Lake Carl Etling. The park is a recreational area with many facilities for camping, hiking and many other outdoor activities. The park is about 15 miles away from the peak.

==Wildlife==
The flora and fauna and terrain of Black Mesa are unique in Oklahoma, more typical of the semi-arid grasslands and rocky buttes of eastern Colorado and New Mexico. Many species reach their easternmost or westernmost limits of their ranges here.

Black Mesa Nature Preserve in particular covers around 60% of the flat portion of the mesa in Oklahoma. Wildlife reported in the park and the reserve are golden eagles, piñon jays, red-tailed hawks, and mule deer, part from a bird area for bird watchers.

===Flora===
The vegetation of the preserve is mostly shortgrass prairie with scattered juniper trees and Cholla cactus. The summit plateau is vegetatively classified as a &quot;Bluestem-grama shortgrass community&quot;. The preserve contains 23 plant species listed by the state as &quot;rare&quot;.

===Fauna===

The indigenous top predator is the mountain lion; its cousin, the smaller bobcat, is also present. The more omnivorous American black bear is present, along with a variety of prey species including bighorn sheep, mule deer, and pronghorn. Eight native species of animal are state-level designated as &quot;rare&quot;. Two lagomorphs are present, the eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), and the black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;). Other mammals include the dog-like coyote, as well as the much smaller prairie dog and a species of badger.

Nine snake species are found in this arid environment, the plains hog-nosed snake, western coachwhip, bullsnake, longnose snake, plains blackhead snake, blackneck garter snake, plains garter snake, lined snake, and prairie rattlesnake. The broad-headed skink, prairie racerunner, red-lipped plateau lizard, northern earless lizard, eastern collared lizard, and Texas horned lizard are also indigenous to the area. Two types of turtle, the ornate box turtle and the yellow mud turtle have been found in the Black Mesa preserve. Only one frog is found in this desert habitat, the American bullfrog, but there are six other species of amphibians; the Great Plains narrowmouth toad, New Mexico spadefoot, plains spadefoot, Woodhouse&#x27;s toad, red-spotted toad, and the western green toad, all toads.
Birds are common, and there are 59 species present during at least some years. Seven different raptors are found, the turkey vulture, American kestrel, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, Mississippi kite, and the prairie falcon, all of which are classed as being of least concern according to the IUCN. There is one other bird of prey, the western screech-owl. There are no waterfowl found on Black Mesa. The mourning dove, greater roadrunner, common nighthawk, common poorwill, ladder-backed woodpecker, red-shafted flicker, olive-sided flycatcher, Say&#x27;s phoebe, ash-throated flycatcher, Cassin&#x27;s kingbird, and western kingbird are also found. There are five corvids; the black-billed magpie, pinyon jay, American crow, and common raven, as well as the more local Chihuahuan raven.
61 species of butterfly are found in the preserve, including seventeen skippers, three swallowtails, four hairstreaks, a copper, four whites, nine true brushfoots, two satyrs, and a leafwing.

There are 91 species of moths on Black Mesa. No species of fish are found on Black Mesa.

==Culture==
A permanent exhibit in the Sam Noble Museum is a diorama of the Black Mesa. It covers and is housed in the Hall of Natural Wonders. Funds for its creation were provided by the Whitten-Newman Foundation. The diorama is touchscreen computerized and interactive and is set within the boundaries of the mesa. It is a replication of the real shape and form of the mesa and is modeled to a suitable scale which brings out the short-grass prairie habitat next to a rivulet. Stuffed and mounted animals on display are the ones found in the mesa, including eagle, vulture, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, mountain lion, prairie dog, jackrabbit and badger. An ephemeral lake is also on display in a cross section format. Star gazers gather each October near Black Mesa for the annual Okie-Tex Star Party.

<text>Flight 90 of the North American X-15 was a research flight conducted by NASA and the US Air Force on July 19, 1963. It was the first of two X-15 missions that passed the 100-km high Kármán line, the FAI definition of space, along with Flight 91 the next month. The X-15 was flown by Joseph A. Walker, who flew both X-15 spaceflights over the Kármán line.

==Crew==
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 15,195 kg fueled; 6,577 kg burnout; 6,260 kg landed
*Maximum Altitude: 106.01 km., 347,800 feet
*Range: 534 km
*Burn Time: 84.6 seconds
*Mach: 5.50
*Launch Vehicle: NB-52B Bomber #008

==Mission highlights==
Maximum Speed - 5,971 km/h. Maximum Altitude - 106,010 m. 80 cm diameter balloon towed on 30 m line to measure air density. First X-15 flight over 100 km (a height known as the Kármán line). This made Walker the first US civilian in space. This was also the first spaceflight of a spaceplane in aviation history. First flight launched over Smith Dry Lake, NV. Experiments: Towed balloon, horizon scanner, photometer, infrared and ultraviolet. Balloon instrumentation failed.

The mission was flown by X-15 #3, serial 56–6672 on its 21st flight.

Launched by: NB-52B #008, Pilots Fulton &amp; Bement. Takeoff: 17:19. UTC Landing: 19:04 UTC.

Chase pilots: Crews, Dana, Rogers, Daniel and Wood.

The X-15 engine burned about 85 seconds. Near the end of the burn, acceleration built up to about 4&quot;g&quot; (39 m/s²). Weightlessness lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. Re-entry heating warmed the exterior of the X-15 to 650 °C in places. During pull up after re-entry, the acceleration built up to 5&quot;g&quot; (49 m/s²) for 20 seconds. The entire flight lasted about 12 minutes from launch to landing.

<doc id="852713" wikidata="Q10781974" url="?curid=852713" title="Grandfather clock">
<text>A grandfather clock (also a longcase clock, tall-case clock, grandfather&#x27;s clock, hall clock or floor clock) is a tall, freestanding, weight-driven pendulum clock, with the pendulum held inside the tower or waist of the case. Clocks of this style are commonly 1.8–2.4 metres (6–8 feet) tall with an enclosed pendulum and weights, suspended by either cables or chains, which have to be occasionally calibrated to keep the proper time. The case often features elaborately carved ornamentation on the hood (or bonnet), which surrounds and frames the dial, or clock face.

The English clockmaker William Clement is credited with developing the form in 1670. Pendulum clocks were the world&#x27;s most accurate timekeeping technology until the early 20th century, and longcase clocks, due to their superior accuracy, served as time standards for households and businesses. Today, they are kept mainly for their decorative and antique value, having been superseded by analog and digital timekeepers.

==Naming==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the popular 1876 song &quot;My Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot; is responsible for the common name &quot;grandfather clock&quot; being applied to the longcase clock.

The song was composed by the American songwriter Henry Clay Work, who discovered a longcase clock in The George Hotel in Piercebridge, County Durham, England. When he asked about the clock, he was informed that it had had two owners. After the first owner died, the clock became inaccurate, and when the second owner died, the clock stopped working altogether. The story inspired Henry to create the song.

Grandfather clocks are of a certain height, usually at least . There are also so-called &quot;grandmother&quot; and &quot;granddaughter&quot; clocks, which are slightly shorter.

The world&#x27;s tallest grandfather clock is tall and is fully operational, with chimes on each quarter hour. It was made by Svoboda Industries in 1976 as a Bicentennial project and is located in Kewaunee, Wisconsin.

==Origin==
The advent of the longcase clock was due to the invention of the anchor escapement mechanism by Robert Hooke in about 1658. Before adopting the anchor mechanism, pendulum clock movements used an older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 80–100 degrees. Long pendulums with such wide swings could not be fitted within a case, so most free-standing clocks had short pendulums.


The anchor mechanism reduced the pendulum&#x27;s swing to around 4 to 6 degrees, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums, which had slower &quot;beats&quot;. They consumed less power, allowing clocks to run longer between windings, caused less friction and wear in the movement, and were more accurate. Almost all longcase clocks use a &quot;seconds pendulum&quot; (also called a &quot;Royal&quot; pendulum) meaning that each swing (or half-period) takes one second. They are about long (to the centre of the bob), requiring a long, narrow case. That case pre-dated the anchor clock by a few decades, appearing in clocks in 1660, to allow a long drop for the powering weights. However, once the seconds pendulum began to be used, the long case proved perfect for housing it as well.

British clockmaker William Clement, who disputed credit for the anchor escapement with Robert Hooke, had made the first longcase clocks by 1680. Later the same year, Thomas Tompion, the most prominent British clockmaker, was making them too. Longcase clocks spread rapidly from England to other European countries and Asia.

The first longcase clocks, like all clocks prior to the anchor escapement, had only one hand; an hour hand. The increased accuracy made possible by the anchor motivated the addition of the minute hand to clock faces in the next few decades.

Between 1680 and 1800, the average price of a grandfather clock in England remained steady at £1 10s. In 1680, that was the amount paid by an average working family for a year&#x27;s rent, so the purchase of clocks was confined to the wealthy. But by 1800, wages had increased enough to allow many lower middle-class households to own grandfather clocks.

Modern longcase clocks use a more accurate variation of the anchor escapement called the deadbeat escapement.

==Description==
Traditionally, longcase clocks were made with two types of movement: eight-day and one-day (30-hour) movements. A clock with an eight-day movement required winding only once a week, while generally less-expensive 30-hour clocks had to be wound daily. Eight-day clocks are often driven by two weights – one driving the pendulum and the other the striking mechanism, which usually consisted of a bell or chimes. Such movements usually have two keyholes, one on each side of the dial, to wind each weight.

By contrast, 30-hour clocks often had a single weight to drive the timekeeping and striking mechanisms. Some 30-hour clocks were made with false keyholes for customers who wanted guests to think that the household was able to afford the more expensive eight-day clock. All modern striking longcase clocks have eight-day mechanical quarter chiming and full hour striking movements. Most longcase clocks are cable-driven, meaning that cables suspend the weights. If the cable was attached directly to the weight, the load would cause rotation and untwist the cable strands, so the cable wraps around a pulley mounted to the top of each weight. The mechanical advantage of that arrangement also doubles the running time allowed by a given weight drop.

Cable clocks are wound by inserting a special crank (called a &quot;key&quot;) into holes in the clock&#x27;s face and turning it. Others, however, are chain-driven, meaning that the weights are suspended by chains that wrap around gears in the clock&#x27;s mechanism, with the other end of the chain hanging down next to the weight. To wind a chain-driven longcase clock, one pulls on the end of each chain, lifting the weights until they are just under the clock&#x27;s face.

==Elaborate striking sequences==
In the early 20th century, quarter-hour chime sequences were added to longcase clocks. A full chime sequence sounds at the top of each hour, immediately followed by the hour strike. At 15 minutes after each hour, 1/4 of the chime sequence plays. Proceeding that, at the bottom of each hour, 1/2 of the chime sequence plays. Then finally, at 15 minutes before each hour, 3/4 of the chime sequence plays. The chime tune used in almost all longcase clocks is Westminster Quarters. Many also offer the option of Whittington chimes or St. Michael&#x27;s chimes, selectable by a switch mounted on the right side of the dial, allowing one to silence the chimes if desired. As a result of adding chime sequences, all modern mechanical longcase clocks have three weights instead of only two. The left weight provides power for the hour strike, the middle-weight provides power for the clock&#x27;s pendulum and general timekeeping functions, and the right weight provides power for the quarter-hour chime sequences.

==Types==
===Comtoise===
Comtoise clocks, also known as Morbier clocks or Morez clocks, are a style of longcase clock made in the French region Franche-Comté (hence their name). Features distinguishing this style are a curving &quot;potbellied&quot; case and a greater use of curved lines. A heavy, elongated, highly ornamented pendulum bob often extends up the case (see photo).

Production of these clocks began in 1680 and continued for about 230 years. During the peak production years (1850–1890) over 60,000 clocks were made each year. These clocks were trendy across the generations; they kept the time on farms throughout France. Many Comtoise clocks can be found in France but they are also frequently found in Spain, Germany, and other parts of Europe, less in the United States. Many Comtoise clocks were also exported to other countries in Europe and even farther, to the Ottoman Empire and as far as Thailand. A wooden sheath usually protected the metal mechanisms during transport.

===Bornholm and Mora===

Bornholm clocks are Danish longcase clocks and were made on Bornholm from 1745 to 1900. In Sweden a special variety of longcase clocks was made in Mora, called Mora clocks.

Bornholm clock-making began in the 1740s when an English ship, which had longcase clocks in its hold, was stranded. They were sent for repair to a turner named Poul Ottesen Arboe in Rønne and as a result of his repair of them he learned enough about clocks to begin to make his own.

<text>Richard Gardiner Willis (February 10, 1865-February 1929) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was the leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party from 1919 to 1922, and served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 until his death.

Born in Lombardy, Canada West, Willis was educated at Smiths Falls High School and the University of Toronto. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as a farmer. In 1891, he married Ella French. Willis was reeve of the Rural Municipality of Morton and mayor of Boissevain. In 1915, he co-nominated James Albert Manning Aikins to become the new leader of the provincial Conservative Party.

Despite having little political experience, Willis was chosen leader of the Manitoba Conservatives on November 6, 1919, defeating future leader Major Fawcett Taylor. His victory was considered an upset, and can probably be credited to the increasingly strong presence of organized farmers in Manitoba. Some believe Conservative delegates were influenced by the recent election of Ernest Drury&#x27;s United Farmers in Ontario.

The Conservative Party had governed Manitoba from 1900 to 1915, but was sidelined by the emergence of farmer and labour radicalism in the late 1910s. It emerged as the fourth-largest parliamentary group in the 1920 election, behind the Liberals, Farmer candidates and Labour. Willis sought election in Turtle Mountain, but lost to incumbent Liberal George McDonald by 14 votes.

He technically retained the leadership of the Manitoba Conservative Party until April 1922, but did not play a significant role in the party after his defeat. John Thomas Haig served as the party&#x27;s leader in the legislature in 1921–22.

Willis ran as the federal Conservative candidate in Souris for the federal election of 1921, but placed a poor second in a two-way race. He stepped down as provincial Conservative leader just before the 1922 provincial election, and was replaced by Taylor.

Ironically, Willis&#x27;s personal electoral fortunes improved after his resignation as leader. He was elected for Turtle Mountain in the 1922 provincial election, and was re-elected in 1927. Both elections were won by the United Farmers of Manitoba, and Willis sat with the Conservatives in opposition. He was still a member of the legislature when he died in Winnipeg in February 1929.

His son, Errick Willis, served as leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party from 1936 to 1954.

<text>HMS &quot;B1&quot; was the lead boat of the B-class submarines built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. The boat survived the First World War and was sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design and description==
The B class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding A class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The B-class submarines had a crew of two officers and thirteen ratings.

For surface running, the boats were powered by a single 16-cylinder Vickers petrol engine that drove one propeller shaft. When submerged the propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the B class had a range of at .

The boats were armed with two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They could carry a pair of reload torpedoes, but generally did not as they would have to remove an equal weight of fuel in compensation.

==Construction and career==
She was originally to have been called &quot;A14&quot; but was renamed &quot;B1&quot; on completion. The boat was built at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness and launched on 25 October 1904. She was too primitive to be of much use in World War I and was quickly relegated to training duties. &quot;B1&quot; was sold for scrap in May 1921.

<text>Actuarial notation is a shorthand method to allow actuaries to record mathematical formulas that deal with interest rates and life tables.

Traditional notation uses a halo system, where symbols are placed as superscript or subscript before or after the main letter. Example notation using the halo system can be seen below.

Various proposals have been made to adopt a linear system, where all the notation would be on a single line without the use of superscripts or subscripts. Such a method would be useful for computing where representation of the halo system can be extremely difficult. However, a standard linear system has yet to emerge.

==Example notation==

===Interest rates===
formula_1 is the annual effective interest rate, which is the &quot;true&quot; rate of interest over &quot;a year&quot;. Thus if the annual interest rate is 12% then formula_2.

formula_3 (pronounced &quot;i &quot;upper&quot; m&quot;) is the nominal interest rate convertible formula_4 times a year, and is numerically equal to formula_4 times the effective rate of interest over one formula_4&quot;th&quot; of a year. For example, formula_7 is the nominal rate of interest convertible semiannually. If the effective annual rate of interest is 12%, then formula_8 represents the effective interest rate every six months. Since formula_9, we have formula_10 and hence formula_11. The &quot;(m)&quot; appearing in the symbol formula_3 is not an &quot;exponent.&quot; It merely represents the number of interest conversions, or compounding times, per year. Semi-annual compounding, (or converting interest every six months), is frequently used in valuing bonds (see also fixed income securities) and similar monetary financial liability instruments, whereas home mortgages frequently convert interest monthly. Following the above example again where formula_13, we have formula_14 since formula_15.

Effective and nominal rates of interest are not the same because interest paid in earlier measurement periods &quot;earns&quot; interest in later measurement periods; this is called compound interest. That is, nominal rates of interest credit interest to an investor, (alternatively charge, or debit, interest to a debtor), more frequently than do effective rates. The result is more frequent compounding of interest income to the investor, (or interest expense to the debtor), when nominal rates are used.

The symbol formula_16 represents the present value of 1 to be paid one year from now:
:formula_17
This present value factor, or discount factor, is used to determine the amount of money that must be invested now in order to have a given amount of money in the future. For example, if you need 1 in one year, then the amount of money you should invest now is: formula_18. If you need 25 in 5 years the amount of money you should invest now is: formula_19.

formula_20 is the annual effective discount rate:
:formula_21
The value of formula_20 can also be calculated from the following relationships: formula_23
The rate of discount equals the amount of interest earned during a one-year period, divided by the balance of money at the end of that period. By contrast, an annual effective rate of interest is calculated by dividing the amount of interest earned during a one-year period by the balance of money at the beginning of the year. The present value (today) of a payment of 1 that is to be made formula_24 years in the future is formula_25. This is analogous to the formula formula_26 for the future (or accumulated) value formula_24 years in the future of an amount of 1 invested today.

formula_28, the nominal rate of discount convertible formula_29 times a year, is analogous to formula_3. Discount is converted on an formula_4&quot;th&quot;-ly basis.

formula_32, the force of interest, is the limiting value of the nominal rate of interest when formula_4 increases without bound:

:formula_34

In this case, interest is convertible continuously.

The general relationship between formula_1, formula_32 and formula_20 is:

:formula_38

Their numerical value can be compared as follows:

:formula_39

===Life tables===
A life table (or a mortality table) is a mathematical construction that shows the number of people alive (based on the assumptions used to build the table) at a given age. In addition to the number of lives remaining at each age, a mortality table typically provides various probabilities associated with the development of these values.

formula_40 is the number of people alive, relative to an original cohort, at age formula_41. As age increases the number of people alive decreases.

formula_42 is the starting point for formula_40: the number of people alive at age 0. This is known as the radix of the table. Some mortality tables begin at an age greater than 0, in which case the radix is the number of people assumed to be alive at the youngest age in the table.

formula_44 is the limiting age of the mortality tables. formula_45 is zero for all formula_46.

formula_47 is the number of people who die between age formula_41 and age formula_49. formula_47 may be calculated using the formula formula_51

formula_52 is the probability of death between the ages of formula_41 and age formula_49.

:formula_55

formula_56 is the probability that a life age formula_41 will survive to age formula_49.

:formula_59

Since the only possible alternatives from one age (formula_41) to the next (formula_61) are living and dying, the relationship between these two probabilities is:

:formula_62

These symbols may also be extended to multiple years, by inserting the number of years at the bottom left of the basic symbol.

formula_63 shows the number of people who die between age formula_41 and age formula_65.

formula_66 is the probability of death between the ages of formula_41 and age formula_65.

:formula_69

formula_70 is the probability that a life age formula_41 will survive to age formula_65.

:formula_73

Another statistic that can be obtained from a life table is life expectancy.

formula_74 is the curtate expectation of life for a person alive at age formula_41. This is the expected number of complete years remaining to live (you may think of it as the expected number of birthdays that the person will celebrate).

:formula_76

A life table generally shows the number of people alive at integral ages. If we need information regarding a fraction of a year, we must make assumptions with respect to the table, if not already implied by a mathematical formula underlying the table. A common assumption is that of a Uniform Distribution of Deaths (UDD) at each year of age. Under this assumption, formula_77 is a linear interpolation between formula_40 and formula_79. i.e.

:formula_80

===Annuities===

The basic symbol for the present value of an annuity is formula_81. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the frequency of payment (i.e., the number of annuity payments that will be made during each year). A lack of such notation means that payments are made annually.
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the annuity starts and the period for which an annuity is paid.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates when payments are made. Two dots indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the beginning of each year (an &quot;annuity-due&quot;); a horizontal line above the symbol indicates an annuity payable continuously (a &quot;continuous annuity&quot;); no mark above the basic symbol indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the end of each year (an &quot;annuity-immediate&quot;).

If the payments to be made under an annuity are independent of any life event, it is known as an annuity-certain. Otherwise, in particular if payments end upon the beneficiary&#x27;s death, it is called a life annuity.

formula_82 (read &quot;a-angle-n at i&quot;) represents the present value of an annuity-immediate, which is a series of unit payments at the &quot;end&quot; of each year for formula_83 years (in other words: the value one period before the first of &quot;n&quot; payments). This value is obtained from:

:formula_84
(formula_85 in the denominator matches with &#x27;i&#x27; in immediate)

formula_86 represents the present value of an annuity-due, which is a series of unit payments at the &quot;beginning&quot; of each year for formula_83 years (in other words: the value at the time of the first of &quot;n&quot; payments). This value is obtained from:

:formula_88
(formula_89 in the denominator matches with &#x27;d&#x27; in due)

formula_90 is the value at the time of the last payment, formula_91 the value one period later.

If the symbol formula_92 is added to the top-right corner, it represents the present value of an annuity whose payments occur each one formula_4th of a year for a period of formula_83 years, and each payment is one formula_4th of a unit.

:formula_96, formula_97

formula_98 is the limiting value of formula_99 when formula_4 increases without bound. The underlying annuity is known as a continuous annuity.

:formula_101

The present values of these annuities may be compared as follows:

:formula_102

To understand the relationships shown above, consider that cash flows paid at a later time have a smaller present value than cash flows of the same total amount that are paid at earlier times.

* The subscript formula_85 which represents the rate of interest may be replaced by formula_89 or formula_105, and is often omitted if the rate is clearly known from the context.
* When using these symbols, the rate of interest is not necessarily constant throughout the lifetime of the annuities. However, when the rate varies, the above formulas will no longer be valid; particular formulas can be developed for particular movements of the rate.

===Life annuities===
A life annuity is an annuity whose payments are contingent on the continuing life of the annuitant. The age of the annuitant is an important consideration in calculating the actuarial present value of an annuity.

* The age of the annuitant is placed at the bottom right of the symbol, without an &quot;angle&quot; mark.

For example:

formula_106 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the end of each year until death to someone currently age 65

formula_107 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable for 10 years with payments being made at the end of each year

formula_108 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year for 10 years, or until death if earlier, to someone currently age 65

formula_109 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the earlier death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64

formula_110 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the later death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64. 

formula_111 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable 12 times a year (1/12 unit per month) until death to someone currently age 65

formula_112 indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the start of each year until death to someone currently age 65

or in general:

formula_113, where formula_41 is the age of the annuitant, formula_83 is the number of years of payments (or until death if earlier), formula_4 is the number of payments per year, and formula_85 is the interest rate.

In the interest of simplicity the notation is limited and does not, for example, show whether the annuity is payable to a man or a woman (a fact that would typically be determined from the context, including whether the life table is based on male or female mortality rates).
The Actuarial Present Value of life contingent payments can be treated as the mathematical expectation of a present value random variable, or calculated through the current payment form.

===Life insurance===
The basic symbol for a life insurance is formula_118. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the timing of the payment of a death benefit. A lack of notation means payments are made at the end of the year of death. A figure in parentheses (for example formula_119) means the benefit is payable at the end of the period indicated (12 for monthly; 4 for quarterly; 2 for semi-annually; 365 for daily).
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the life insurance begins.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates the &quot;type&quot; of life insurance, whether payable at the end of the period or immediately. A horizontal line indicates life insurance payable immediately, whilst no mark above the symbol indicates payment is to be made at the end of the period indicated.

For example:

formula_120 indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the year of death.

formula_121 indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the month of death.

formula_122 indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the (mathematical) instant of death.
===Premium===
The basic symbol for premium is formula_123 or formula_124. formula_123 generally refers to net premiums per annum, formula_124 to special premiums, as a unique premium.

== Force of mortality ==

Among actuaries, force of mortality refers to what economists and other social scientists call the hazard rate and is construed as an instantaneous rate of mortality at a certain age measured on an annualized basis.

In a life table, we consider the probability of a person dying between age (&quot;x&quot;) and age &quot;x&quot; + 1; this probability is called &quot;q&quot;&quot;x&quot;. In the continuous case, we could also consider the conditional probability that a person who has attained age (&quot;x&quot;) will die between age (&quot;x&quot;) and age (&quot;x&quot; + Δ&quot;x&quot;) as:

: formula_127

where &quot;F&quot;&quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the cumulative distribution function of the continuous age-at-death random variable, X. As Δ&quot;x&quot; tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Δ&quot;x&quot;. If we let Δ&quot;x&quot; tend to zero, we get the function for force of mortality, denoted as &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;):

<text>The Albert was a light car built by aircraft parts maker Adam, Grimaldi &amp; Company and named after their Albert Embankment address. It was designed by A. O. Lord, creator of the later Loyd-Lord. It was produced from 1920 to 1924 in Vauxhall and later Chiswick, London. 

The car with a taxation rating of 12HP was powered by a proprietary four-cylinder 1495 cc ohv engine made by Gwynnes Limited and had four-speed transmission driving the rear wheels. The chassis had quarter elliptic springs and brakes were on the rear wheels only. The cars were expensive and boasted a radiator similar to that of the Rolls-Royce. The body was mainly made of aluminium and most were 4-seat tourers.

Adam, Grimaldi &amp; Co., was taken over by Gwynnes Limited of Chiswick in 1920 after about 250 cars were made. Gwynnes moved production to their factory and then made about 1450 more of the original 12HP design. 

In 1923 a new model was announced with the engine enlarged to 1944 cc and the name changed to Gwynne-Albert. A plate clutch replaced the previous cone one and the suspension changed to semi-elliptic leaf springs. From 1925 front wheel brakes were fitted. About 200 of the larger-engined cars were built, with the last ones being sold possibly as late as 1929.

The Gwynne 8 model was also available with an Albert style radiator and sold under the Albert name but only around eight are believed to have been sold.

<doc id="852729" wikidata="Q5127583" url="?curid=852729" title="Clarks River">
<text>The Clarks River, named for William Clark of the 1804-1806 Lewis and Clark Expedition, is a tributary of the Tennessee River in the Jackson Purchase region of western Kentucky. 
Below the West Fork Clarks River, the river has a mean annual discharge of 368 cubic feet per second. This figure is obtained by combining the average discharge of the Clarks River at Benton, and the average discharge of the West Fork at Brewers.

==Two forks==
For the greater part of its length, it consists of two parallel forks of approximately equal size, the East Fork and the West Fork. The East Fork, shown on federal maps as the main stem of the river, begins south of Murray near the community of Puryear in Henry County, Tennessee and is paralleled by the Paducah, Tennessee and Alabama Railroad. The West Fork begins about west of Murray near the intersection of Jones-Sparkman and Butterworth Roads in Calloway County and flows through Kaler and Symsonia in Graves County before joining with the East Fork at Oaks Station in McCracken County.

==Artifacts==
The Clarks River streams from Murray in Calloway County through Benton in Marshall County and ends in Paducah (McCracken County), where the mouth of the river intersects with the Tennessee River just before the Tennessee River joins the Ohio River. This river is full of wildlife including the venomous water moccasin snake. Documented evidence states that many Native American encampments and Indian tribes camped and lived along its banks. To this day artifacts have been found including spearheads, arrowheads and pottery.

The river is the namesake of Clarks River Road in Paducah.

<text>John Thomas Haig, (December 15, 1877 – October 23, 1962) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as parliamentary leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party in 1921–22.

Born in Colborne, Ontario, Haig received his BA from the University of Manitoba, was called to the Manitoba bar in 1904 and worked as a Barrister-at-law. In 1907, he married Josephine M. Dickie. He was elected to the Winnipeg Public School Board in 1908, and continued to hold this position after entering provincial politics, also serving as board chairman. In 1927, Haig was named King&#x27;s Counsel. He was president of the Manitoba Curling Association and of the Assiniboia Lawn-Bowling Club.

Haig was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for Assiniboia in 1914. He was soundly defeated in the Liberal landslide of 1915, but returned to the legislature in 1920 at the head of the Conservative Party list in Winnipeg. (Winnipeg elections were determined by a form of proportional representation at this time.)

Conservative leader R.G. Willis was unable to win a seat in the 1920 election, and Haig was called to lead the eight-member caucus in parliament. He ran for the party&#x27;s leadership in April 1922, but was defeated by Major Fawcett Taylor.

Haig was re-elected to the legislature in 1922, 1927 and 1932, and remained an important voice for the party.

In August 1935, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett. From 1945 until 1957, Haig was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for the Progressive Conservative Party. After the 1957 federal election, Haig joined the Cabinet of John Diefenbaker, serving as Minister without portfolio and Leader of the Government in the Senate until May 11, 1958.

He retired from the Senate on January 17, 1962 due to poor health.

Haig died in Winnipeg at the age of 84.

His son James Campbell Haig also served in the Senate.

<text>X-15 Flight 91 was an August 22, 1963 American crewed sub-orbital spaceflight, and the second and final flight in the program to fly above the Kármán line, which was previously achieved during Flight 90 a month earlier by the same pilot, Joseph A. Walker. It was the highest flight of the X-15 program. 

Flight 91 was the first internationally recognized spaceflight of a reused spacecraft, as Walker had also flown plane number three on the previous sub-orbital spaceflight over the Kármán line on July 19. The flight was air-launched from a modified Boeing B-52 Stratofortress support plane over Smith Ranch Dry Lake, Nevada, United States. Walker piloted the X-15 to an altitude of 107.96 km and remained weightless for approximately five minutes. The altitude was the highest crewed flight by a spaceplane to that time, and remained the record until the 1981 flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. 

Walker landed the X-15 about 12 minutes after it was launched, at Rogers Dry Lake, Edwards Airforce Base, in California. This was Walker&#x27;s final X-15 flight.

==Mission highlights==
On this flight, Joe Walker became the first person to enter space twice. He had a maximum speed of 3,794 mph (6,106 km/h) and a maximum altitude of 354,200 feet. Second and final X-15 flight over 67 miles. Unofficial altitude record set for class. Highest altitude achieved by X-15. Last flight for Walker in X-15 program. Number 1 left RCS nozzle froze up. First flight with altitude predictor instrument (needed calibration).

The mission was flown by X-15 #3, serial 56-6672 on its 22nd flight.

Launched by: NB-52A #003, Pilots Russell Bement &amp; Lewis. Takeoff: 17:09 UTC. Landing: 18:56 UTC.

Chase pilots: Wood, Dana, Gordon and Rogers.

The X-15 engine burned about 85 seconds. Near the end of the burn, acceleration built up to about 4 G (39 m/s²). Weightlessness lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. Re-entry heating warmed the exterior of the X-15 to 650°C in places. During pull-up after re-entry, acceleration built up to 5 G (49 m/s²) for 20 seconds. The entire flight was about 12 minutes from launch to landing.

<doc id="852744" wikidata="Q1755707" url="?curid=852744" title="From a Basement on the Hill">
<text>From a Basement on the Hill is the sixth and final studio album by the American singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. Recorded from 2000 to 2003, and faced with multiple delays due to Smith&#x27;s personal problems that resulted in his death, it was released posthumously in the UK and Europe on Domino on October 18, 2004, and in the US the following day on October 19, 2004, through record label Anti-, almost a year after his death.

The album was initially planned as a double album, and was incomplete at the time of Smith&#x27;s death. Many of the songs Smith intended for the album remained unfinished, in some cases lacking only vocals. Smith&#x27;s family hired his former producer Rob Schnapf and ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and finish the batch of over thirty songs that were recorded for the album, although the estate retained final decision on which tracks to include.

Many of the songs reference Smith&#x27;s struggles with drug addiction and depression. His cause of death is officially unknown, as the coroner&#x27;s report remarks that some aspects pointed to suicide and some to murder. The official nature of the case and statements from close friends state that his death is still under speculation. It has not been investigated further.

&quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; became Smith&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US and was praised by critics, with reviewers complimenting the album&#x27;s attempts to expand Smith&#x27;s sound, such as the incorporation of instrumental passages, as well as heavier, guitar-based material.

== Background ==

On October 21, 2003, Elliott Smith died of two stab wounds, presumed by many to be self-inflicted. The wounds occurred following a heated argument at the Los Angeles home of his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The coroner&#x27;s determination was that the mode of death was undetermined and raised the possibility of homicide.

Smith battled heavy drug addiction and severe depression for most of his life, although he was sober in his final days, seeking treatment at the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills and even giving up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugars and most of his prescribed psychiatric medications on his 34th birthday. Smith took to sobriety with the same intensity with which he took to intoxication, and he found himself suddenly face-to-face with a lifetime of depression and unmanaged emotional trauma.

== Recording and production ==

The album was initially planned as a double album, due to contractual obligations with the DreamWorks label (now Interscope). Smith had over fifty songs on tape reel or digital hard drive. He completed mixing on nine of these tracks with several others lacking only minor revisions or final vocals. Smith&#x27;s estate hired Schnapf and Bolme to complete mixing on these tracks and eventually chose fifteen for inclusion on the album, which was ultimately released on the Anti- label. During the recording period for the album, Smith had recorded with Steven Drozd and Russell Simins, drummers for The Flaming Lips and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, respectively.

Following Smith&#x27;s death, Rob Schnapf, producer of Smith&#x27;s earlier albums &quot;Either/Or&quot;, &quot;XO&quot; and &quot;Figure 8&quot;, was hired to mix and produce the album, along with Smith&#x27;s former girlfriend Joanna Bolme. David McConnell, although present throughout much of the actual recording process, was not consulted during the mixing, nor was he asked for the extensive three years&#x27; worth of notes he and Smith had made while the album was being recorded. When asked why he personally took up the job of finishing the album, Schnapf stated, &quot;I had a paternal, protective feeling. I didn&#x27;t want anybody mucking it up.&quot;

== Content ==

&quot;Coast to Coast&quot; features poetry by Nelson Gary. Smith told &quot;Under the Radar&quot; in 2003: &quot;I asked this friend of mine to make up something he could say as fast as he could in fifteen minutes about people healing themselves or being unable to heal themselves. While he&#x27;s saying this thing there is a main vocal that goes over that.&quot; The lyric &quot;You&#x27;re keeping me around, until I finally drag us both down&quot; details a dysfunctional relationship.

&quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot; was previously released as a single in August 2003 on Suicide Squeeze Records, along with a different version of &quot;A Distorted Reality Is Now a Necessity to Be Free&quot;. According to McConnell, Smith did not intend to have &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot; on the album.

In &quot;King&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, where he sings &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas time and the needle&#x27;s on the tree, the skinny Santa is bringing something to me&quot;, Smith alludes to using heroin, which he had many problems with.

The lyrics also contain references to the practice of a Circuit rider (religious), the Liberty Bell, The Dalles, Oregon and Lite-Brite toys.

Schnapf noted that the track &quot;Ostrich &amp; Chirping&quot;, a short instrumental made from sampling and looping the noises made by a toy bird, had nothing to do with Smith and was something that McConnell had recorded by himself. McConnell said &quot;don&#x27;t ask me how this ended up on the record, I totally forgot I had put that on one of his reels.&quot;

== Release ==

&quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; was released on October 19, 2004, almost a year after Smith&#x27;s death, through record label ANTI-, a sub-label of Epitaph.

It debuted at No. 19 in the US, selling 43,000 copies, giving him his best first week sales, and making it his highest-charting album in the US to date. The album has also been re-released by Kill Rock Stars, alongside a remastered reissue of his 1994 debut, &quot;Roman Candle&quot;.

When asked what Smith would have thought of the album, McConnell told Benjamin Nugent, &quot;I don&#x27;t think he would have delivered [that] record. The record he would have delivered would have had more songs, would have had different mixes and [been] a little more in-your-face.&quot; Schnapf also expressed that the final result that he and Bolme had produced was not the album that Smith would have made, simply because Elliott was not around to finish the album. Bolme also said that they did not add anything to the songs, and only mixed whatever had been recorded: &quot;I would never presume to add anything. We didn&#x27;t add anything.&quot;

== Reception ==
After his death and the release of &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot;, many critics and fans viewed the album as a suicide note. Sindri Eldon, a journalist for &quot;Reykjavík Grapevine&quot; wrote, &quot;...the foreshadowing of his suicide is so strong that it&#x27;s difficult to listen to.&quot;

&quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; was well received by critics. On music review aggregator website Metacritic, the album holds an approval rating of 88 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. It is one of the site&#x27;s all-time highest-rated albums. Many reviewers complimented the album&#x27;s attempts to expand Smith&#x27;s sound, such as the incorporation of instrumental passages, as well as heavier, guitar-based material.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;perfectly coherent and cohesive, without any sense of being slapped together from half-finished parts.&quot; E! Online called it &quot;a beautiful swansong to one of this generation&#x27;s best.&quot; &quot;Filter&quot; called it &quot;large and epic, but tense and claustrophobic as well, and, gratefully, it&#x27;s as close to Elliott as we&#x27;ve ever been.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;Smith bundles together subtlety and ferocity to create one of his heart-aching best... Consider it a &#x27;fond farewell&#x27; to one of this generations most poignant and gifted songwriters.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had some reservations, observing that &quot;this is an album about the seductions of oblivion, and a few of the more densely arranged songs mimic the characters in the lyrics, stumbing around without quite connecting. More often though, Smith teases extraordinary wit and warmth from songs that float lazily toward happiness.&quot;

In the UK the album was received even more enthusiastically than in Smith&#x27;s home country. &quot;Q&quot; wrote, &quot;Given that its backstory involves one of the grimmest deaths in music history, it&#x27;s tempting to view this album darkly, but really, there&#x27;s no denying the new twist here... Without wanting to second-guess his mindset, this music often sounds like the madness surrounding its creator – his heroin troubles, an allegedly turbulent relationship, his struggles against depression. So what dominates are these loud, wayward Los Angeles epics full of gothic grandeur, broken-glass emotions, bizarre soundscapes and heavy, early-&#x27;70s guitars.&quot; The review concluded, &quot;All posthumous releases receive garlands of praise but this would take your breath away whatever the circumstances&quot;.

Other critics, however, were cautious about viewing the album as a suicide note: &quot;Mojo&quot; felt that &quot;to do so would be to miss the crucial point – that &quot;From a Basement on the Hill&quot; is of a piece within a body of work that stretches back to the mid-&#x27;90s. If Smith&#x27;s lyrical themes were pretty much constant, the point was only underlined by the survival of his abiding aesthetic. In very crude terms, he took the spirit of such &quot;White Album&quot; songs as &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, and re-rooted them in a lovelorn, druggy demi-monde... Smith, however, was no mere &quot;pasticheur&quot;. As ever, his chord changes and arrangements betray an inventiveness seemingly borne of brilliant instinct. Moreover, the songs that form this album&#x27;s spine find him striding away, not only from his own influences, but the approach that had defined his last couple of records. Those who found &quot;Figure 8&quot; and parts of &quot;XO&quot; too in thrall to the musical ways of the West Coast – slightly over-airbrushed, maybe a little too lush – will be cheered by the fractured, frankly grungey likes of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Down&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;: in their own controlled way, as messy and imperfect as the experiences described therein. The contrast between their music and Smith&#x27;s ever-tender vocals makes for a compelling tension; here, he alights upon an approach that would have gone on to serve him admirably well.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; observed that the opening track &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; &quot;sets out the themes which run through the whole album: chronic self-doubt, poisonous sarcasm, a prevailing sense of having had enough of trying to fulfil other people&#x27;s expectations&quot;, and went on to state that &quot;while this is clearly not the record Smith intended to make, it&#x27;s still an immensely gripping and cohesive piece of work. For all his experiments with grungier rock and spectral acoustics, &quot;From a Basement...&quot; holds together convincingly. It sounds like a completely finished album, and one which, remarkably, is a match for the very best in Smith&#x27;s catalogue.&quot;

<doc id="852746" wikidata="Q787527" url="?curid=852746" title="Alcyon">
<text>The Alcyon was a French bicycle, automobile and motorcycle manufacturer between 1903 and 1954.

== Origins ==
Alcyon originated from about 1890 when Edmond Gentil started the manufacture of bicycles in Neuilly, Seine. In 1902, this was complemented by motorcycle production and in 1906, the first cars were shown at the &quot;Salon de l&#x27;Automobile&quot; in Paris, France. Also in 1906 it founded the professional Alcyon cycling team which was active until 1955, including winning the Tour de France 6 times.

==Motorcycle racing==
In 1912 Alcyon competed at the Isle of Man TT races with a 348cc single-cylinder engine featuring two inlet valves and two exhaust valves. Both bikes failed to finish the Junior TT race.

Alcyon had local success in France during the 1920s, with riders such as Marc Jolly, Marcel Mourrier, Jean Durand and Lucien Lemasson winning races. During this time too, this bicycle brand got its nickname &quot;l&#x27;intrépide Alcyon&quot;.

== Voiturettes before the World War I ==
Two models were shown in 1906, one a two-seat light car with single-cylinder 950 cc engine and a larger four seat model with 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine. Both engines were bought in from Gentil. The cars were advanced models with 3-speed gearboxes and shaft drive. However, the single-cylinder models were dropped in 1912 and larger models of up to 2120 cc were added to the range. By then, most of the engines were obtained from Zurcher.

The company moved to Courbevoie, Seine in 1912.

In 1954 Peugeot absorbed Alcyon.


== Cyclecars between wars ==

In 1914, the company&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Automobiles Alcyon&quot;. After the war, the first model was a 1914 cc four-cylinder model, some examples of which were tuned and sold by the Lyons agent as Alycon-GLs and performed quite well in competition. However, the car was not a success and did not sell well, so in 1923, Alcyon moved into the production of cyclecars, using 500 cc two-stroke flat-twin engines in a design bought from SIMA-Violet. Later the company manufactured another cyclecar of similar design, thought this one featured a single-cylinder engine. This proved a complete flop, and the company failed in 1928. Alcyon never sold cars again.

== Trophée Gentil (1946-1963) ==
In 1946, the &quot;Gentil Trophy&quot; was created in memory of the founder of Cycles Alcyon, who died that year. It was awarded for the &quot;achievement of the year&quot;, and took the form of a work of art created by Carlo Sarrabezolles. Each National Federation expressed its choice and the winner had to obtain 70% of the votes to obtain this honorary title.

<text>Lieutenant-General Leonidas Polk (April 10, 1806 – June 14, 1864) was a Confederate general, a bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and founder of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America, which separated from the Episcopal Church of the United States. He was a planter in Maury County, Tennessee, and a second cousin of President James K. Polk. He resigned his ecclesiastical position to become a major-general in the Confederate States Army, when he was called &quot;&#x27;s Fighting Bishop&quot;. His official portrait at the University of the South depicts him as a bishop with his army uniform hanging nearby. He is often erroneously referred to as &quot;Leonidas K. Polk&quot; but he had no middle name and never signed any documents as such.

Polk was one of the war&#x27;s more notable, yet controversial, political generals. Recognizing his familiarity with the Mississippi Valley, Confederate president Jefferson Davis commissioned his elevation to a high military position regardless of his lack of prior combat experience. He commanded troops in the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Perryville, the Battle of Stones River, the Tullahoma Campaign, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Chattanooga Campaign, and the Atlanta Campaign. He is remembered for his bitter disagreements with his immediate superior, the likewise-controversial General Braxton Bragg of the Army of Tennessee, and for his general lack of success in combat. While serving under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston, he was killed in action in 1864 during the Atlanta Campaign.

==Early life and education==
Leonidas Polk was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Colonel William and Sarah ( Hawkins) Polk. William was a Revolutionary War veteran and prosperous planter. He was of Scottish And Anglo-Huguenot ancestry. Capitalizing on his position as chief surveyor of the central district of Tennessee, he acquired about of land.

Polk briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before entering the United States Military Academy at West Point. During his senior year, he left the Scottish Calvinist church. He joined the Episcopal Church and was baptized in the Academy Chapel by Chaplain Charles P. McIlvaine, who later became the Episcopal Bishop of Ohio. Polk had an impressive academic record, excelling in rhetoric and moral philosophy. He graduated eighth of 38 cadets on July 1, 1827, and was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the artillery.

Polk resigned his commission on December 1, 1827, to enter the Virginia Theological Seminary. He became an assistant to Bishop Richard Channing Moore at Monumental Church in Richmond, Virginia. Moore agreed to ordain Polk as a deacon in April 1830; however, on a visit to Raleigh in March, it was discovered that he had never been confirmed as an Episcopalian. To remedy the fact, before his ordination, he was hastily confirmed at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Fayetteville, NC. He was then ordained a deacon as planned and a priest the following year. On May 6, 1830, Polk married Frances Ann Devereux, daughter of John Devereux and Frances Pollock; her mother was the granddaughter of Puritan theologian Jonathan Edwards. The Polks had eight children who survived to adulthood.
In 1832, Polk moved his family to the vast Polk &quot;Rattle and Snap&quot; tract in Maury County, Tennessee, and constructed a massive Greek Revival home called Ashwood Hall. Polk was the largest slaveowner in the county in 1840, owning 111 slaves. (By 1850, the census recorded that Polk owned 400 slaves, but other estimates are as high as 1000.) He built a family chapel with his four brothers in Maury County, St. John&#x27;s Church, at Ashwood. He also served as priest of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Columbia, Tennessee. He was appointed Missionary Bishop of the Southwest in September 1838 and was elected first Bishop of Louisiana in October 1841. In 1848, he performed the marriage of his niece, Mary Bayard Devereux, to Major William John Clarke.

Polk was the leading founder of the in Sewanee, Tennessee, which he envisioned as a national university for the Southern United States and a New World equivalent to Oxford and Cambridge, both in England. (In his August 1856 letter to Bishop Elliott, he expounded on the secessionist motives for his university.) Polk laid and consecrated the cornerstone for the first building on October 9, 1860. Polk&#x27;s foundational legacy at Sewanee is remembered through his portrait &quot;Sword Over the Gown&quot;, painted by Eliphalet F. Andrews in 1900. After the original was vandalized in 1998, a copy by Connie Erickson was unveiled on June 1, 2003. The title refers to the answer given by Polk &quot;when asked in Richmond if he was putting off the gown of an Episcopal bishop to take up the sword of a Confederate general, to which he replied, &#x27;No, Sir, I am buckling the sword over the gown,&#x27;&quot; indicating that he saw it was his duty as a bishop to take up arms.

==American Civil War==
===Kentucky===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Polk pulled the Louisiana Convention out of the Episcopal Church of the United States to form the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. Although he hoped that secession would result in a peaceful separation of the slave states from the United States and suggested that he was reluctant to take up arms personally, he did not hesitate to write to his friend and former classmate at West Point, Jefferson Davis, offering his services in the Confederate States Army. Polk was commissioned a major general on June 25, 1861, and ordered to command Department No. 2 (roughly, the area between the Mississippi River and the Tennessee River). He committed one of the great blunders of the Civil War by dispatching troops to occupy Columbus, Kentucky, in September 1861; the governor of the critical border state of Kentucky had declared its neutrality between the United States and the Confederacy. Still, Polk&#x27;s action prompted the Kentucky legislature to request U.S. aid to &quot;expel the invaders&quot;, ensuring U.S. control of Kentucky for the remainder of the war.

During this period, Polk argued about strategy with his subordinate, Brig. Gen. Gideon Johnson Pillow, and his superior, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of Confederate forces in the Western Theater. Resentful that his former West Point roommate was giving him orders, he submitted a resignation letter to President Davis on November 6, but Davis rejected the request. Polk&#x27;s command saw its first combat on November 7, 1861: the minor Battle of Belmont between troops under Pillow and U.S. soldiers under Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Polk was wounded nearby on November 11 when the largest cannon in his army, nicknamed &quot;Lady Polk&quot; in honor of his wife, exploded during demonstration firing. The explosion stunned Polk and blew his clothes off, requiring several weeks of recovery.

===Army of Mississippi===

In April 1862, Polk commanded the First Corps of Albert Sidney Johnston&#x27;s Army of Mississippi at the Battle of Shiloh. He continued in that role for much of the year under Beauregard, who assumed command following the death of Johnston at Shiloh and then under Gen. Braxton Bragg. At various times, his command was considered a corps and, at other times, the &quot;Right Wing&quot; of the army. In the fall, during the invasion of Kentucky by Bragg and Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, Polk was in temporary command of the Army of Mississippi while Bragg visited Frankfort to preside over the inauguration of a Confederate governor for the state. Polk disregarded an order from Bragg to attack the flank of the pursuing U.S. army near Frankfort.
At the Battle of Perryville, Polk&#x27;s right wing constituted the main attacking force against Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio, but Polk was reluctant to attack the small portion of Buell&#x27;s army that faced him until Bragg arrived at the battlefield. One enduring legend of the Civil War is when Polk observed his subordinate, Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, advancing his division, and Cheatham allegedly shouted, &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, boys!&quot; Polk seconded the cheer while retaining the sensibility of a clergyman: &quot;Give it to &#x27;em, boys; give &#x27;em what General Cheatham says!&quot;

===Army of Tennessee===
After Perryville, Polk began a year-long campaign to get Bragg relieved of command, hoping to use his close relationship with President Davis to accomplish his goal. Despite the failure of his Kentucky campaign, Bragg was retained in command, but this did nothing to reduce the enmity between Polk and Bragg. Polk was promoted to lieutenant general on October 11, 1862, with date of rank of October 10. He became the second most senior Confederate of that rank during the war, behind James Longstreet. In November, the Army of Mississippi was renamed the Army of Tennessee and Polk commanded its First Corps until September 1863.

Polk fought under Bragg at the Battle of Stones River in late 1862. Once again, Bragg&#x27;s subordinates politicked to remove their army commander after an unsuccessful battle (the battle was tactically inconclusive, but Bragg was unable to stop the advance of the U.S. Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans and Bragg withdrew his army to Tullahoma, Tennessee). Bragg was also unsuccessful in resisting Rosecrans&#x27;s advance in the Tullahoma Campaign, which began to threaten the important city of Chattanooga. In the face of Rosecrans&#x27;s expert maneuvering of his army, Polk counseled Bragg to retreat rather than stand and fight in their Tullahoma fortifications.

Rosecrans eventually maneuvered Bragg out of Chattanooga, and the Army of Tennessee withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia with the Army of the Cumberland in hot pursuit. Bragg planned to attack and destroy at least one of Rosecrans&#x27; corps, advancing separately over mountainous roads. He was infuriated when Polk&#x27;s division under Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman failed to attack an isolated U.S. Army corps at Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads as ordered on September 11. Two days later, Polk disregarded orders from Bragg to attack another isolated corps, the second failed opportunity. At the Battle of Chickamauga, Polk was given command of the Right Wing and the responsibility for initiating the attack on the second day of battle (September 20). He failed to inform his subordinates of the plan, and his wing was late in attacking, allowing the U.S. defenders time to complete their field fortifications. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, &quot;our independence might have been won.&quot;

Chickamauga was a great tactical victory for Bragg. Still, instead of pursuing and destroying the U.S. army as it retreated, he laid siege to it in Chattanooga, concentrating his effort against the enemies inside his army instead of his enemies from the North. Bragg demanded an explanation from Polk on his failure to attack in time on September 20, and Polk placed the blame entirely on one of his subordinates, Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill. Bragg wrote to President Davis, &quot;Gen&#x27;l Polk by education and habit is unfit for executing the plans of others. He will convince himself his own are better and follow them without reflecting on the consequences.&quot; Bragg relieved Polk of his command and ordered him to Atlanta to await further orders. Although Polk protested the &quot;arbitrary and unlawful order&quot; to the Secretary of War and demanded a court of inquiry, he was not restored to his position. Davis once again retained Bragg in army command, despite the protestations of several of his subordinate generals.

===Mississippi===
President Davis transferred his friend Polk to command the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana (December 23, 1863 – January 28, 1864) and then the Department of Alabama and East Mississippi (January 28 – May 4, 1864), giving him effective command of the state of Mississippi following the departure of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to replace Bragg in command of the Army of Tennessee. Polk unsuccessfully attempted to oppose Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s raid against Meridian, Mississippi, in February 1864. In May, he was ordered to take his forces and join Johnston in resisting Sherman&#x27;s advance in the Atlanta Campaign. He assumed command of the Third Corps of the Army of Tennessee on May 4. His command remained commonly known as the &quot;Army of Mississippi&quot;.

===Atlanta Campaign and death===
Polk brought more than 20,000 men with him to Georgia. Because of his elevated rank, he became the army&#x27;s second in command under Johnston. By using successive flanking maneuvers, Sherman forced Johnston to withdraw his army from strong defensive positions to protect the Confederate line of communication. This forced Johnston ever closer to the critically important city of Atlanta.

On June 14, 1864, Polk was scouting enemy positions near Marietta, Georgia, with his staff when he was killed in action by a U.S. shell at Pine Mountain. The artillery fire was initiated when Sherman spotted a cluster of Confederate generals — Polk, William J. Hardee, and Johnston, with their staffs — in an exposed area. He pointed them out to Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard, commander of the U.S. IV Corps, and ordered him to fire upon them. Battery I of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery, commanded by Capt. Hubert Dilger, obeyed the order within minutes. The first round from the battery came close and a second came even closer, causing the men to disperse. The third shell struck Polk&#x27;s left arm, went through his chest, and exited, hitting his right arm, then exploded against a tree; it nearly cut Polk in two.


==Legacy==
Although his record as a field commander was poor, Polk was immensely popular with his troops, and the Army of Tennessee deeply mourned his death. Polk&#x27;s funeral service at Saint Paul&#x27;s Church in Augusta, Georgia, was one of the most elaborate during the war. His friend Bishop Stephen Elliott of Georgia presided at the service, delivering a stirring funeral oration. He was buried in a location under the present-day altar. The church has a monument to Polk near the altar, and the original grave site can be visited. In 1945, his remains and those of his wife were reinterred at Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans. His grave can be found in the front floor sanctuary, to the right of the pulpit. Fort Polk in Louisiana was named for Polk until 2023 when it was renamed Fort Johnson.

Polk&#x27;s nephew, Lucius E. Polk, was also a Confederate general. Lucius E. Polk&#x27;s son Rufus King Polk was a Congressman. Polk&#x27;s son, William Mecklenburg Polk, was a physician and a Confederate captain who later served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I. He later authored his most flattering biography. William M. Polk&#x27;s son, Frank Polk, served as a counselor to the U.S. Department of State through World War I and later became the first Under Secretary of State. A brother of Polk, Lucius Junius Polk, married a grand-niece of Rachel Jackson, wife of U.S. President Andrew Jackson. U.S. President James K. Polk was Polk&#x27;s second cousin.

Polk&#x27;s portrait, done by Cornelius Hankins, was donated to Christ Church Cathedral in Nashville, Tennessee, by his grandson W. Dudley Gate, in 1963.

Military historian Steven E. Woodworth described the shell that killed Polk as &quot;one of the worst shots fired for the Union cause during the entire course of the war&quot;, as Polk&#x27;s incompetence made him far more valuable alive than dead: &quot;Polk&#x27;s incompetence and willful disobedience had consistently hamstrung Confederate operations west of the Appalachians, while his special relationship with the president made the bishop-general untouchable.&quot;

<text>Michael Binkley is a fictional character in Berke Breathed&#x27;s cartoon strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;.

Michael, known to all simply as &#x27;Binkley,&#x27; is a 10-year-old boy who lives at the Bloom County Boarding House with his father Tom (his mother, Margret, had divorced Tom and moved to Oakland with a Hells Angel).

Binkley is in the same class as Milo Bloom, his best friend. Binkley introduces Opus to his group, at first believing him to be a dog. Binkley is described as &quot;an airhead&quot; by everyone who knows him (except Opus). Binkley is the first recurring child character after Milo to appear in the strip and largely replaced the dog Rabies as Milo&#x27;s sounding board.

Binkley originally appears as a player on Milo&#x27;s elementary school football team. The coach is Major Bloom, who uses the team to live out his fantasy of being a great military commander. Binkley is originally depicted as a stereotypical nerd; he is much smaller than the other children and has thick glasses, bad skin, and messy hair. Soon afterwards, Binkley appears in his &quot;classic&quot; look (Opus at one point comments that Binkley looks like a carrot). Binkley&#x27;s father initially calls him &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and hopes he will live out his failed dreams by becoming a star middle linebacker. Binkley, on the other hand, is interested in ballet, wants to dance the lead in &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and dreams of being a hairdresser. He is a Star Wars fan and dreams of being a master Jedi.

He constantly wakes up his easily irritated father in the middle of the night to talk to him about celebrity gossip, politics and random anxieties to the point where the father eventually cannot sleep without those interruptions. He also has a closet in his room where his anxieties dwell and plague him at night. Their leader is the Giant Purple Snorklewacker, but the anxieties can range from typical things like giant snakes to computer technology to politically themed ones like a pair of disagreeing macroeconomists. In one instance, the anxiety closet showed Binkley his future middle-aged self: a balding, paunchy, lifelong failure who gives grandiose nicknames to his wife, daughter, house, car, dog, etc. Binkley is infatuated with an African American girl named Blondie (scandalizing the rather conservative townsfolk, including his father). Binkley campaigns with the Meadow Party.

In the Sunday strip &quot;Opus&quot;, it is revealed that Binkley had become a eunuch in Tibet after a disastrous first date. However, Binkley makes a sudden and unexplained reappearance in the June 3, 2007 &quot;Opus&quot; strip in which he is depicted in his &quot;classic&quot; incarnation.

<doc id="852761" wikidata="Q4229657" url="?curid=852761" title="Christopher Commission">
<text>The Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, informally known as the Christopher Commission, was formed by then-mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley in April 1991, in the wake of the Rodney King beating. 

It was chaired by attorney Warren Christopher (who later became U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton). &quot;The commission was created to conduct &#x27;a full and fair examination of the structure and operation of the LAPD,&#x27; including its recruitment and training practices, internal disciplinary system, and citizen complaint system.&quot;

A year after the commission was formed, the officers involved in the King beating were acquitted, leading to the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

== Findings ==
The following are, verbatim, some of the commission&#x27;s findings: 

* There is a significant number of officers in the LAPD who repetitively use excessive force against the public and persistently ignore the written guidelines of the department regarding force.
* The failure to control these officers is a management issue that is at the heart of the problem. The documents and data that we have analyzed have all been available to the department; indeed, most of this information came from that source. The LAPD&#x27;s failure to analyze and act upon these revealing data evidences a significant breakdown in the management and leadership of the Department. The Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, lacking investigators or other resources, failed in its duty to monitor the Department in this sensitive use of force area. The Department not only failed to deal with the problem group of officers but it often rewarded them with positive evaluations and promotions.
* We recommend a new standard of accountability...Ugly incidents will not diminish until ranking officers know they will be held responsible for what happens in their sector, whether or not they personally participate.&quot;
*The commission highlighted the problem of &quot;repeat offenders&quot; on the force, finding that of approximately 1,800 officers against whom an allegation of excessive force or improper tactics was made from 1986 to 1990, more than 1,400 had only one or two allegations. But 183 officers had four or more allegations, forty-four had six or more, sixteen had eight or more, and one had sixteen such allegations. Generally, the forty-four officers with six complaints or more had received positive performance evaluations that failed to record &quot;sustained&quot; complaints or to discuss their significance.
The Christopher Commission found that only forty-two of 2,152 allegations of excessive force from 1986 to 1990 were sustained - or less than 2 percent. &quot;According to the Christopher Commission &#x27;... the complaint system is skewed against complainants.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The majority of investigations at that time were done by division staff, not IAD, and the commission found this seriously problematic because division investigators often failed even to interview or identify witnesses.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Bad Religion&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Pray on Me&quot; cryptically references the Christopher Commission with the line &quot;the city exploded but the Gates wouldn&#x27;t open so the company asked him to quit.&quot;

* In the 3rd episode of FX&#x27;s &quot;The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;, the Christopher Commission is mentioned by Johnnie Cochran (played by Courtney B. Vance) in the way how the Los Angeles Police see black people.
* In episode 3 of season 4 of &quot;Bosch&quot;, the Christopher Commission is mentioned.

<text>Ānanda Mārga (, also spelled Anand Marg and Ananda Marg), or officially Ānanda Mārga Pracāraka Saṃgha (organization for the propagation of the path of bliss), is a world-wide socio-spiritual organisation founded in Jamalpur, Munger, Bihar, India, in 1955 by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, known as Shrii Shrii Anandamurti. It is also the name of the philosophy and life-style propounded by Sarkar, described as a practical means of personal development and the transformation of society. It is established in more than 180 countries across the world. Its motto is &quot;Ātmamokśārthaṃ jagaddhitāya ca&quot; (Self-Realisation and Service to the Universe).

Tantra yoga, as interpreted by Sarkar, serves as the foundation of Ananda Marga. According to his teachings, Tantra means liberation from darkness through the expansion of mind. Meditation is the main spiritual practice of this tantric tradition, which assists the practitioner to overcome weaknesses and imperfections. The path to liberation in Ananda Marga is free of religious dogmas, superstitions, artificial social barriers and ritualism. Ananda Marga recognizes spirituality and liberation as the birth right of every individual irrespective of one&#x27;s race, caste, creed, nationality, gender, socio-economic status or belief system.

The basis of Ananda Marga practice is covered by a set of rules called the &#x27;Sixteen Points&#x27; that guide the practitioner on both spiritual and social aspects. It consist of yoga asanas, mudras, bandhas, pranayama, self-massage and two specific dances, &quot;kaos&#x27;ikii&quot; and &quot;tandava&quot;. A lacto-vegetarian diet and fasting are also included as a fundamental part of yogic practice. The goal of Ananda Marga is &quot;self-realization and the welfare of all&quot;.

== Founding ==
Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, known as Sri Sri Anandamurti, founded the Ananda Marga on 1 January 1955 in the state of Bihar, India. Its stated aims are &quot;liberation of self and service to humanity&quot;..

== Disciplines, teachings and practice ==

Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar developed a discipline of Tantra yoga and meditation. Tantra yoga, as interpreted by him, is the practical philosophy which serves as foundation of Ananda Marga. According to Sarkar&#x27;s teachings Tantra means liberation from darkness.
Meditation is the main spiritual practice of this tradition, and through it the practitioner struggles to overcome weaknesses and imperfections. The basis of Ananda Marga practice is covered by a set of rules called the &#x27;Sixteen Points&#x27; that guide the practitioner on both spiritual and social aspects. Sarkar expounded these principles in his 1961 &quot;&quot;, in Sanskrit.

=== Meditation, &quot;Lalita Marmika&quot; dance and &quot;kirtan&quot; ===

In the Tantric tradition of Ananda Marga, the spiritual aspirant or sadhaka practices sadhana. This signifies the effort through which a person becomes completely realized. In Tantra the spiritual master, the guru, plays a special role, guiding students on the spiritual path. The aspirant learns meditation from a qualified &quot;acarya&quot;. An &quot;acarya&quot; is most commonly a monk or nun, but in the Ananda Marga tradition there are also &quot;family &quot;acaryas&quot;&quot;. In the initiation the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual lessons personal. In addition, he also taught &quot;Kapalika&quot; meditation to many &quot;sanyásins&quot;. His system of &quot;yoga&quot; can be termed as &quot;Rájadhirája Yoga&quot;, &quot;Tantra Yoga&quot;, or simply &quot;Ánanda Márga Yoga&quot;. The basic Ananda Marga meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga. The system consists of six meditation techniques or lessons taught one by one, on a personal basis. The six lessons are: 1)&quot;Iishvara Pranidhana&quot; (Personal mantra and &quot;Ishta Cakra&quot;), 2) &quot;Guru Mantra&quot; (Personal &quot;Guru Mantra&quot;), 3) &quot;Tattva Dharana&quot; (Concentration on &quot;Cakras&#x27; Tattvas&quot;), 4) &quot;Sadharana Pranayama&quot; (Basic &quot;Pranayama&quot;. A special breathing technique), 5) &quot;Cakra Shodhana&quot; (Purification of &quot;Cakras&quot;. A special type of &quot;Dharana&quot;), 6) &quot;Guru Dhyana&quot; (Special type of ideation for &quot;Dhyana&quot;). A set of higher meditation lessons is taught to advanced practitioners committed to dedicate more time for spiritual practices and universal service.

According to the Ananda Marga system, the &quot;Lalita Marmika&quot; dance is performed particularly during the collective meditation. It was supposedly invented by Parvati, the wife of the god Shiva. This yogic dance with swaying movements, combined with a &quot;kirtan&quot; (the chanting of the universal mantra), is regarded as useful in freeing the mind and preparing it for meditation. Ananda Marga members are recommended to practice collective meditation at least once a week. These meetings, &quot;Dharma Chakras&quot; (held weekly in the &quot;Dhyan Mandir&quot;), are preceded by the singing of &quot;Prabhat Samgiita&quot; (&quot;Songs of the New Dawn&quot; composed by Sarkar) followed by the spiritual dance of &quot;Lalita Marmika&quot;. Before meditation the &#x27; mantra is chanted. At the end of meditation the &#x27; and the &quot;&quot; mantras are recited. Baba Nam Kevalam is a universal kirtan mantra given by Sarkar.

=== Vegetarian diet, yogic asanas, physical exercises and yogic treatments ===
The basic practices of Ananda Marga are yoga asanas, mudras, bandhas, pranayama, self-massage and two specific dances, &quot;kaos&#x27;ikii&quot; and &quot;tandava&quot;. These are accompanied by Lacto-vegetarian diet and fasting.
* Diet and fasting: Lacto-vegetarian diet avoids meat, fish, eggs and some substances which are said to have a negative effect on the mind, particularly if &quot;mucus-producing&quot;. On specific monthly dates called &quot;Ekadashi&quot; (Sanskrit: একাদশী, ekādaśī, the eleventh day after the full moon), the regular practice of &quot;Upavasa&quot; (yoga fasting) is recommended to improve health and strengthen the mind.
* &quot;Yoga asanas&quot;, &quot;mudras&quot; and &quot;bandhas&quot;: comprises 42 asanas chosen by Sarkar. The asanas are to be performed at least once a day. 15 &quot;Yoga mudras&quot; and &quot;bandhas&quot; are included.
* Yogic treatments: in 1957 Sarkar published in Bengali &quot;Yaogika Cikitsa o Dravyaguna&quot;, translated into English and published in 1983, with revisions under the title &quot;Yogic Treatments and Natural Remedies&quot;. In this handbook, he described yogic treatments using asanas and mudras with claims about natural and traditional remedies for about forty diseases.
* &quot;Kaoshikii&quot;: the &#x27;dance for mental expansion&#x27;, was defined by Sarkar a &#x27;physico-psycho-spiritual dance,&#x27; performed by all, and consists of 18 mudras aligning with 6 physical postures, each associated with a specific idea while strengthening body and mind and making them flexible.
* &quot;Tandava&quot; or &quot;Tāṇḍava&quot;: is a vigorous dance. This dance is only performed by male followers. The dance is performed to imbue the practitioner&#x27;s mind with courage and honour, dispelling all sorts of complexes and fear, even fear of death itself.

== Spiritual and social philosophy ==
The philosophy of Ananda Marga is a synthetic outlook, recognizing a theistic singularity or &#x27;Supreme Consciousness&#x27;, which is claimed to be both transcendental and manifested in all.
To this end Ananda Marga suggests what it claims is a practical, rational, and systematic way of life for the balanced development of all human potentialities: physical, psychic and spiritual. This incorporate practices from hygiene, diet, and yoga postures, to a technique of meditation based on moral rules directed to inner fulfillment. It recognizes that a balance is needed between the spiritual and mundane aspects of existence, and that neither one should be neglected at the expense of the other. Hence, the goal of Ananda Marga is &quot;self-realization and the welfare of all&quot;.

=== Spiritual philosophy ===

The spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga recognizes that the universe is the creation of the mental thought waves of the &#x27;Supreme consciousness&#x27;. The following is a brief list of the essential elements of Ananda Marga spiritual philosophy:
* Atma or Soul and Paramatma or the Cosmic Consciousness: the Consciousness (&quot;Purusa&quot;) is reflected in the unit objects forming the &quot;unit consciousness&quot; or &quot;atma&quot;. Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called &#x27; and in that case the &quot;reflector-soul&quot; is called &quot;Paramatma&quot; (Supreme Soul).
* Realms of the Mind: according to Ananda Marga philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called &quot;Kosas&quot;: 1)&quot;Kamamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;desire layer&quot;) or &quot;Crude Mind&quot;: is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama-Niyama. 2)&quot;Manomaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;layer of thinking&quot;) or &quot;Subtle Mind&quot;: is the layer of thought and memory. 3)&quot;Atimanasa Kosa&quot; or &quot;Supramental Mind&quot;: is the intuitive layer. 4)&quot;Vijinanamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;layer of the special knowledge&quot;) or &quot;Subliminal Mind&quot;: is the layer of conscience or discrimination (&#x27;) and &#x27; (non-attachment). 5)&quot;Hiranyamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;golden level&quot;) or &quot;Subtle Causal Mind&quot;: is the subtlest layer. Here the awareness of mind is very close to the direct experience of &quot;Supreme Consciousness&quot;.
* Microvita theory: &quot;Microvita&quot; means &quot;micro-life&quot;. The concept was introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality and of psychic expression. They are imagined as smaller and subtler than physical atoms and subatomic particles. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron. The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.

=== Social philosophy ===

The social outlook of Ananda Marga asserts that human beings are an expression of the Supreme Being, the welfare of the individual is linked with the welfare of the collective, each relying on the other for its existence and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the right to equal opportunities of life and development and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as race, nationality and religion. Ananda Marga advocates a state if live, a world of justice, security and peace for all. The social philosophy covers neohumanism, education, culture, and the organisation&#x27;s own Progressive utilization theory (PROUT). The philosophy reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto, &quot;Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: &#x27;the culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations ... it is the same, but varying in expression.&#x27;&quot; In 1968, Sarkar founded the organization &quot;Proutist Block of India&quot; to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.

=== Tantra in Ananda Marga ===
Sarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of Tantra, infusing new insights in human psychology, social theory and in each individuals&#x27; roles as spiritual and &quot;socio-economic-cultural-political&quot; beings. Ananda Marga Tantra is claimed to have a broad metaphysical base which allows for ways of knowing, feeling and processing which go beyond intellectuality or limited rationality. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Sarkar notes, &quot;spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.&quot; Ananda Marga Tantra is claimed to be a principle which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The essence of Tantra is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.

=== &quot;Guru&quot; and disciple ===

According to tantric tradition a proper preceptor and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of Tantra.
P.R. Sarkar clearly explains that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.

==Confrontations==

During the 1960s, the organisation expanded rapidly in India, sending Acharyas as missionaries to other continents. Ananda Marga&#x27;s popularity in India put it in direct confrontation with the Communist Party in West Bengal. In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders. Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

=== Sarkar&#x27;s incarceration ===
In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of five former Ananda Marga members, on what were later proved false charges. The Ananda Marga organisation was banned and a number its leaders arrested. In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an investigation into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been proved innocent of all charges.

=== Bijon Setu massacre ===

The Bijon Setu massacre (Bengali: বিজন সেতু হত্যাকাণ্ড) was the killing and burning of 16 &quot;sadhus&quot; and a &quot;sadhvi&quot; of Ananda Marga, at Bijon Setu, West Bengal, India, on 30 April 1982. Although the attacks were carried out in broad daylight, no arrests were ever made. After repeated calls for a formal judicial investigation, a single-member judicial commission was set up in 2012 to investigate the killings.

<text>The Alda was a French automobile created by Fernand Charron of Charron, Girardot et Voigt (CGV), manufactured between 1912 and 1922. The car had a dashboard radiator and a inline-four engine that was claimed to be capable of going &quot;6 to 47 mph in top gear&quot; (9.7–76 km/h). Cars were available with the Henriod rotary valve system; another version featuring six cylinders was also offered. Post-World War I, the four was the only model offered, though it was rebored to .

The name &quot;ALDA&quot; was invented by the readers of the magazine &quot;l&#x27;Auto&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Ah - La Délicieuse Automobile!&quot;.

<text>Shadis is an independent gaming magazine that was published in 1990–1998 by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). It initially focused on role-playing games.

==Publication history==
Shadis was conceived and started by Jolly Blackburn as an independent gaming fanzine in 1990. In 1993, Blackburn formed AEG to publish Shadis as a quality small-press magazine, and brought on John Zinser and David Seay as partners. Printing of the first three issues was paid for by Frank Van Hoose, a friend of Jolly&#x27;s, who also wrote for the magazine. A year later, in late 1994, the magazine received its biggest success by including a random &quot;&quot; card in each issue at a time when booster packs of the new card game were scarce; many players bought multiple copies of each issue hoping to find a rare or out-of-print card. Many readers were also drawn to a small comic strip, &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, which was initially a filler, intended to fill a blank spot in the magazine, but later took on a life of its own.

In 1995, Blackburn left AEG because he felt that Zinser and Seay were too focused on the new collectible card game (CCG) industry while he wanted to keep the company fun and small and focus on &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;. Blackburn departed with the rights to &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; and a few other properties. In a 2000 interview on the &quot;Gaming Outpost&quot; website, Zinser explained that he had wanted the in-debt company to grow at a faster pace than Blackburn was comfortable with, hence Blackburn&#x27;s departure.

In 1998, &quot;Shadis&quot; went &quot;on hiatus&quot; and publication ceased.

In drawing lessons from this magazine&#x27;s demise, Wolfgang Baur, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Kobold Quarterly&quot;, thought it was a mistake for &quot;Shadis&quot; to rely too heavily on content that was not focused on fantasy in general and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in particular.

==Contents==
Each issue contained a variety of articles covering many different aspects of role-playing game systems and genres. The series included game reviews, adventures, fiction, maps, gaming advice, and cartoons. In addition to &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, comic strips &quot;Fineous Fingers&quot; and &quot;Bright Future&quot; also proved to be very popular.

==Reception==
In the August 1994 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 208), Lester Smith wrote a favourable review, saying &quot;A truly independent publication, it covers a wide range of topics in the gaming hobby, and always entertains.&quot;

In a retrospective review of &quot;Shadis&quot; #15 in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, John O&#x27;Neill said &quot;it is no longer being published, and the industry is poorer for it. It was an incredible magazine, with the joy and wonder of role playing spilling off of every page. I&#x27;m glad we had it for as long as we did, and back issues are still available at various online outlets, including eBay.&quot;

==Reviews==
*&quot;Dragon&quot; #212 (December 1994) p94

==Awards==
During its five-year existence, &quot;Shadis&quot; was the winner of the 1994, 1995, and 1996 Origins Awards for &quot;Best Professional Gaming Magazine&quot;

<doc id="852782" wikidata="Q147159" url="?curid=852782" title="Vicia cracca">
<text>Vicia cracca (tufted vetch, cow vetch, bird vetch, blue vetch, boreal vetch), is a species of flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and Asia. It occurs on other continents as an introduced species, including North America, where it is a common weed. It often occurs in disturbed habitats, including old fields and roadside ditches.

==Description==
Cow vetch is in the family Fabaceae and similar to a pea in growth habit with climbing stems growing to 150 cm long, perennial, sending out noose-like branched tendrils from the tips of its leaves when it contacts another plant and securely fastens itself. This can cause &quot;strangling&quot; of smaller plants. An individual plant may reach a length (or height) of 2 m with a white taproot, which may extend up to 1 m. The leaves are 3–8 cm long, pinnate, with 8–12 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet 5–10 mm long.

The plant is fast-growing and flowers prolifically, sending out 10 to 40 flowered one-sided racemes cascading pea-flower shaped purple to violet flowers from the leaf axil during its late spring to late summer flowering period. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees; when the flowers drop off and tiny bright green seed pods 10–20 mm long, start to form. Cow vetch is very similar to hairy vetch (&quot;Vicia villosa&quot;), but is distinguished from the latter by its smooth stem.
The seed pods are 2 cm long and contain 6 to 8 seeds. They resemble those of a very small pea. The tiny seeds within are ripe when the pods have turned black. Unripened seeds are swollen and have a green tint to them, but they unswell when they become ripe. The seed pods vary from light brown to dark brown with black spots.

==Distribution==
&quot;Vicia cracca&quot; is native to Europe and Asia, and has been introduced to large areas of North America.

==Habitat==
Recorded as very frequent on waste ground as an introduced species occurring casually. In hedges and waste places.

==Cultivation and uses==

Cow vetch is widely used as a forage crop for cattle, and is beneficial to other plants because, like other leguminous plants, it enriches the soil in which it grows by its nitrogen-fixing properties. Cow vetch is also much appreciated by bees and butterflies as a source of nectar. The plant may also be used to curb erosion.

Owners of pet birds such as budgerigars often use cow vetch as a nutritious food; the birds are especially fond of the seeds but may also eat the foliage.

Its utility as a cover crop and source of green manure has encouraged the introduction and naturalisation of cow vetch far beyond its native range. In North America the plant is naturalised from southern Canada to upstate South Carolina; it is considered an invasive weed in some areas and its sale may be regulated.

Cow vetch can be a potentially detrimental species in areas where it is not native. The vetch may crowd out native plants, especially in areas of disturbed soil where the vetch may dominate before other plants have a chance to take hold. This is especially a concern in prairie and other natural habitat restoration or land reclamation projects in North America.

<text>This is a list of the kings of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Kent.

The regnal dates for the earlier kings are known only from Bede. Some kings are known mainly from charters, of which several are forgeries, while others have been subjected to tampering in order to reconcile them with the erroneous king lists of chroniclers, baffled by blanks, and confused by concurrent reigns and kings with similar or identical names. It is commonplace for the later kings to be referred to as subkings, but the actual rank used is always &quot;rex&quot;, never &quot;regulus&quot; (except for a late legend concerning Eormenred). The usual style was simply King of Kent (&quot;rex Cantiae&quot;) or King of the Kentish Men (&quot;rex Cantuariorum&quot;). Territorial division within Kent is not alluded to, except by Eadberht I (&quot;rex Cantuariorum terram dimidii&quot;) and Sigered (&quot;rex dimidie partis prouincie Cantuariorum&quot;).

<text>The Wolf River is a river in the U.S. states of Tennessee and Kentucky that rises at the base of the Cumberland Plateau in Fentress County, Tennessee and flows westward for several miles before becoming part of Dale Hollow Lake. The river is part of the Cumberland River drainage basin in Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. Via the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. It is not to be confused with the Wolf River of West Tennessee which flows into the Mississippi at Memphis.

The Wolf River begins at the confluence of Pogue Creek and Delk Creek in a rugged hollow approximately southeast of the community of Pall Mall. Two miles below its source, the river absorbs Rotten Fork before entering the communities of Wolf River and Pall Mall, both of which are associated with World War I hero Alvin C. York. York&#x27;s farm and gristmill were both located along the river at Pall Mall, and he and his family are buried in the large cemetery at Wolf River. York&#x27;s farm is now part of a state historic park. The area is known as &quot;the valley of the three forks of the Wolf,&quot; as noted in the 1941 film &quot;Sergeant York.&quot; Below Pall Mall, the river continues westward across the northeastern Highland Rim into Pickett County, passing just east and north of Byrdstown as it flows through rolling farmland and forest. About a mile downstream from the TN 111 bridge, its water becomes slack due to the impoundment of Dale Hollow Lake on the Obey River. The lake&#x27;s Wolf River embayment winds along the Kentucky-Tennessee border and has its confluence with the Obey River embayment just southeast of the point where Pickett County, Clay County, Tennessee, and Clinton County, Kentucky meet. Before the lake was impounded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, the confluence was the site of the community of Lillydale, formerly called Mouth of Wolf. The Lillydale name lives on in a Corps recreation area on the south shore of the lake. The Wolf River embayment also lies in Cumberland County, Kentucky.

<text>The Young All-Stars are a team of fictional DC Comics superheroes. They were created by Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas, and Michael Bair, and introduced in &quot;Young All-Stars&quot; #1, dated June 1987. The team members Tsunami, Neptune Perkins, and Dan the Dyna-Mite were all introduced in previously published DC Comics stories. The team members Iron Munro, Flying Fox, and Fury were created for the series and intended to be analogs of the Golden Age versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman respectively.

&quot;Young All-Stars&quot; lasted for 31 issues, as well as one annual.

==Publication history==
&quot;Young All-Stars&quot; was a follow-up to DC&#x27;s popular 1980s series All-Star Squadron, created and written by Roy Thomas. &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; retroactively introduced new stories into DC&#x27;s Golden Age history, mainly during World War II. The series premise was that during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created Article X, a &quot;superhero draft&quot; that asked all active masked crime-fighters and superhuman adventurers to join forces as a special war-time group, the All-Star Squadron. The team&#x27;s base was located on the grounds of the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The team introduced brand new characters, used many of DC&#x27;s Golden Age heroes, and also featured Golden Age heroes who weren&#x27;t published by DC Comics in the 1930s and 40s but had since been acquired by the company. The series was known for revising and expanding parts of the fictional history of DC Comics superheroes.

The series took place on the parallel world of Earth-Two, which DC had designated as the reality where stories published during the Golden Age of Comics took place. Modern day comics (starting with the mid-1950s) were said to occur in a reality called Earth-One. While the Golden Age Superman, introduced in 1938, had lived through World War II, the Earth-One Superman had not even been born until long after the war was over. While the modern-day Earth-One Wonder Woman was a superhero in her prime, new stories revealed that the Golden Age Wonder Woman of Earth-Two had fought Nazis during World War II, then later semi-retired, married her dear friend Steve Trevor, and had a daughter named Hyppolyta Trevor (who became a hero called Fury and joined a team of heroes known as Infinity, Inc.).

During the 1985-1986 series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Earth-Two and Earth-One, along with some other realities, merged into a new, unified reality with a revised history. The heroes of World War II now existed in the same timeline as modern heroes, simply operating at an earlier time. While it was not a major problem to establish that certain characters such as the Golden Age Flash (a man named Jay Garrick) and the later Flash (a man named Barry Allen) could co-exist and both operate during different time periods, this explanation didn&#x27;t work for heroes with direct counterparts. Golden Age heroes such as Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, and Green Arrow all of whom had the same secret identities, same basic origin stories, and largely similar supporting casts as their modern day counterparts. For this reason, these particular Golden Age heroes, and some others, had to be removed from the history of the new, unified timeline. This also meant the canon of several recent &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; stories was now questionable, since the Golden Age versions of those same heroes made multiple appearances in the series. To clear the slate after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and re-launch the franchise, &quot;All Star Squadron&quot; was canceled with issue #67 and replaced with a successor series, &quot;Young All-Stars&quot;.

&quot;Young All-Stars&quot; featured the previously existing characters Neptune Perkins and young Dan the Dyna-Mite as stand-ins for the Golden Age versions of Aquaman and Robin, respectively. The rest of the team consisted of brand new characters created to be spiritual and contextual analogs for other eliminated Golden Age characters: Iron Munro stood in for Superman, Flying Fox stood in for Batman, and Fury stood in for Wonder Woman (this new character was now said to be the mother of the modern day hero Fury who served in Infinity, Inc., who was originally meant to be the Earth-Two Wonder Woman&#x27;s daughter). Another character included in the team was Tsunami, who had been originally introduced in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot;.

&quot;Young All-Stars&quot; issue #1 also introduced a team of villains called Axis Amerika, a subversive US-based organization that included agents of the Axis Powers. The members of the group were all evil analogs for the Golden Age versions of Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, Robin, Green Arrow, and Aquaman. The villains included: Übermensch, Gundra the Valkyrie, Der Grosshorn Eule (Horned Owl) and his son/sidekick Fledermaus, the archer Usil, and the amphibious wolfman called Sea Wolf.

==Fictional history==
While carrying out a mission for the All-Star Squadron, TNT and Dyna-Mite are ambushed by members of Axis America. During the battle, TNT is killed. Dyna-Mite, who barely survives, is aided by Arn Munro, a young man who possesses superhuman physical abilities. Iron Munro, Fury (Helena Kosmatos), Flying Fox, and Dan help fend off an Axis America attack on Squadron headquarters. The four young heroes meet up with Neptune Perkins and Tsunami while heading out to the West Coast to track down Axis America. Later on they meet and recruit the Tigress.

After routing the forces of Axis America, the five young heroes are invited to join the All-Star Squadron on a probationary basis. They fight foreign and local Axis threats. They also meet an older group of metahumans collected by the Allied countries known as The Young Allies whose members come from Russia, China, France, and England. The Young All-Stars are disbanded after being absorbed into the All-Star Squadron.

<text>The Alfi was a German automobile brand built between 1921 and 1925, and again between 1927 and 1928. The Alfi was built in Berlin (then in Prussia), initially by the electrical company AG für Akkumulatoren- und Automobilbau (AAA) (), which later also changed its name to Alfi.

==First generation==
The company had been responsible for the AAA line of electric cars and vans which were supplied in large numbers to the German postal service. In 1922, when the company decided to move to engine driven cars, it changed its name to Alfi, derived from the owner&#x27;s name, Alex Fischer.

The first Alfi model had a flat-twin engine. This was followed by a side valve inline-four engine manufactured by Steudel of Kamenz in Saxony. Next came an inline-four of built by Atos of Berlin. The company ceased production in 1925.

==Second generation==
A new Alfi company, Alfi Automobile GmbH was formed in 1927, also by Alex Fischer. This time the cars and vans were three-wheelers powered by DKW engines driving the single front wheel. These could be turned 180 degrees to propel the car backward. An additional four-wheeled model, the 4-wheeled Alfi Sport, had a 2/10PS engine, was bodied as an open or coupe two-seater, and was produced in small numbers. The company closed in 1928.

The class was originally called Intercontinental A (ICA), first introduced in 1981 at the European Championship as a secondary direct-drive class to Formula K. The class was first contested at the World Cup in 2006. In 2007—after 26 seasons of racing—ICA was replaced by KF2 and became the primary class in 2010, replacing KF1 at the World Championship. The KF2 class was renamed to KF upon the demise of KF1 in 2013, and was replaced by Original Kart (OK) regulations in 2016.

OK is currently contested as the primary direct-drive class at the Karting World Championship and the Karting European Championship.

== History ==

=== Intercontinental A (1981–2006) ===

In 1981, Intercontinental A (ICA) was introduced alongside Formula K as a secondary direct-drive class for the European Championship.

Stefano Modena completed back-to-back ICA European Championships in 1984, a feat that would not be repeated until Andrea Kimi Antonelli under OK regulations in 2021.

The ICA World Cup was introduced in 2006, the final year of ICA regulations, won by French driver Mike Courquin.

=== KF2/KF (2007–2015) ===

In January 2007, the CIK-FIA decided to replace the 100 cc water-cooled two-stroke ICA engines with 125 cc Touch-and-Go (TaG) water-cooled two-stroke KF2 engines, producing . Now the secondary class to KF1—which had replaced Formula A—the KF2 class karts used hand-operated front brakes via a lever. The chassis had to be CIK-approved, with a minimum weight of 160 kg and 158 kg for national and international events, respectively. KF2 karts were equipped with an electric starter and a centrifugal clutch. The engine was limited to 15,000 rpm.

In 2010, karts of the KF2 category were mandated at the Karting World Championship as the primary direct-drive category, alongside the European Championship, replacing KF1 in both. KF1 returned to the World Championship in 2011 and 2012, reverting KF2 back to World Cup status, but met its demise at the end of the 2012 season. With the end of KF1 regulations, KF2 became known as simply KF and returned to the World Championship as the primary class once more.

=== Original Kart (2016–present) ===

In 2016, Original Kart (OK) regulations replaced KF in the direct-drive category, after its perceived failure within the kart racing community and restrictive regulations resulted in reduced entries at international competitions. OK karts had much of the electronics removed, and had to be push-started.

== Specification ==

=== Original Kart (OK) ===

There are eight main technical features of the OK regulations:

* 125 cc direct-coupled, water-cooled two-stroke, mixed-lubrication engine.

* Valve inlet in the piston skirt. 

* Screw carburettor with a maximum diameter of 24 mm.

* Maximum speed (limiter) of 16,000 rpm. 

* Power valve at the exhaust.

* Single rear brake with hydraulic control. 

* Premium tyres, medium gum compound.

* Minimum weight 150 kg, driver included.

Engines, chassis, bodywork, brakes and tyres are subject to the homologation system put in place by the CIK-FIA. Each year, the tyres and the fuel for each category, as well as the KZ and KZ2 carburettor, are chosen after a call for tenders.

== Champions ==

OK has been contested at the European Championship since 1981 and the World Championship/World Cup since 2006, becoming the primary direct-drive class in 2010. 

Italian driver Lorenzo Travisanutto is the only driver to win multiple OK World Championships. Notable OK World Champions include 2020–21 Formula E World Champion Nyck de Vries and Formula One driver Lando Norris.

Italian Formula One drivers Stefano Modena and Andrea Kimi Antonelli are the only drivers to win multiple OK European Championships. Notable OK European Champions include Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champions Michael Schumacher and Max Verstappen.

<text>The Batman Adventures is a DC Comics comic book series featuring Batman, set in the universe of and its succesors.

==Overview==
&quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; was created to tie-in with the &quot;&quot;. As the animated series changed with each successive re-branding and relaunch, so too did &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot;. It was originally conceived as a miniseries, but eventually got its status as tie-in.

The success of &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; has also led to a set of &quot;Adventures&quot; titles mirroring the animated series that followed &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, including &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; (based on &quot;&quot;) and &quot;Justice League Adventures&quot; (based on &quot;Justice League&quot;).

==&quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; (vol. 1, 1992–1995)==
Based on &quot;&quot;, the first series ran for 36 issues, 2 annuals, and 3 specials (&quot;Mad Love&quot; and &quot;Holiday Special&quot;, which were both adapted into episodes for &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, plus an adaptation of the &quot;&quot; movie). The first annual introduces Roxy Rocket, who would later appear in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; episode &quot;The Ultimate Thrill&quot; and the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Knight Time&quot;. Most of the issues were written by Kelley Puckett, and illustrated by Mike Parobeck and Rick Burchett, though Ty Templeton did the writing and art on a few issues. &quot;Mad Love&quot; was written by Paul Dini and illustrated by Bruce Timm, while the holiday special was written and illustrated by a number of creative people who had worked on the animated series, including Paul Dini, Bruce Timm, Glen Murakami, Dan Riba, and Kevin Altieri.

==&quot;The Batman and Robin Adventures&quot; (1995–1997)==
Following the re-branding of the animated series as &quot;The Adventures of Batman and Robin&quot;, the comic series was relaunched. It ran for 25 issues and 2 annuals, as well as 2 specials (an adaptation of &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot;; and &quot;Dark Claw Adventures&quot;, a non-canon Amalgam comic featuring the Batman-Wolverine hybrid). Ty Templeton was the regular writer, with Rick Burchett as the artist. However, according to colorist Rick Taylor, the series was cancelled before many planned stories could be published. Some of them included another Batgirl and Robin team up, Batman teaching a grieving widower the futility of vengeance, the origin of the Threatening Three and the first appearance of Anarky.

==&quot;The Batman Adventures: The Lost Years&quot; (1998)==
Shortly after &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; began airing on Kids WB!, DC Comics published a five issue miniseries titled &quot;The Batman Adventures: The Lost Years&quot;. This series bridged the gap between the end of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; and the start of the new show. Additionally, the first two issues were adapted from the episode &quot;Old Wounds,&quot; and issues #4 and the end of issue #5 were adaptations of the episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;.

Book One: Robin (Dick Grayson) voices his disapproval regarding Batman&#x27;s tolerance of the crime-fighting activities of the relatively untrained Batgirl and takes it upon himself to stop her. Subsequently, Batman deduces that Batgirl is actually Barbara Gordon while watching her play tennis against Dick – he realizes that she moves just like Batgirl. Batman decides to take Batgirl under his wing and give her the training she needs. Robin is upset by this decision and argues with Batman, but refuses to change his mind.

Book Two: Bruce and Dick continue their argument up through Dick&#x27;s college graduation ceremony. When the Joker unleashes a radar jammer that can cause aircraft to crash, Batman and Batgirl battle him and his gang before Dick, as Robin, intervenes. The Joker is defeated, but Dick is so enraged at Batman, for putting Batgirl in danger and not telling him that she was Barbara, that he punches him and storms away. He decides to leave Gotham City, despite the protests of Alfred and Barbara.

Book Three: Dick breaks up a smuggling operation by Two-Face and discovers an ancient African tribe, where he learns combat techniques from them, finally taking the first steps out of Batman&#x27;s shadow. In Africa, Dick develops a new persona for himself: Nightwing.

Book Four: Batman becomes angrier and more driven because of Dick&#x27;s departure – his new partner, Batgirl, is concerned over his change in personality. One night, while on the trail of Two-Face, Batman saves young Tim Drake, son of petty criminal &quot;Shifty&quot; Drake. Shifty was trying to stop Two-Face from holding Gotham City ransom prior to his death (his body was found in Metropolis), and Tim seeks to honor his father&#x27;s dying wish. Batman trained Tim into Robin to save him from a life of crime. Two-Face was captured and Batman took in Tim as his second ward.

Book Five: Dick joins an expedition to find a group of Tibetan monks who have lost an artifact, agreeing to recover the artifact in exchange for their secret of flight (the winged costume). He succeeds in gaining the artifact back from Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Succeeding, he visits Batman and reveals his new identity of Nightwing to him, Alfred, Batgirl, and Robin.

==&quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot; (1998–2003)==
A new series based on &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; titled &quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot; ran for 60 issues. This was the longest-running series in the &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; line. Early issues were written by Ty Templeton and illustrated by Rick Burchett, while the team of Scott Peterson, Tim Levins, and Terry Beatty did most of the later issues. Batgirl and Nightwing appeared in most of the later issues. This series received a lot of positive reviews and was praised for its level of characterization.

==&quot;Batman Adventures&quot; (vol. 2, 2003–2004)==
In 2003, DC Comics launched &quot;Batman Adventures&quot;, shortly after the cancellation of &quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot;. The first issue was made available through regular purchases and Free Comic Book Day (May 3, 2003). It ran for 17 issues before being canceled to make way for &quot;The Batman Strikes!&quot;, a new title based on the new, unrelated, animated series &quot;The Batman&quot;. Every issue had two stories, one by Dan Slott and Ty Templeton, while the other was by Ty Templeton and Rick Burchett.

The running plot in the series is that The Penguin has managed to be elected Mayor of Gotham and has ordered the police led by a reluctant James Gordon to pursue and arrest Batman. Batman for his part refuses to believe the election of Penguin was legitimate and amid his other crime fighting efforts pursues evidence to de legitimize Penguin’s mayoralty.

Issue #15, written by Jason Hall, bridges the gap between Mr. Freeze&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;. Issue #17 ends the series with Batman confronting Joe Chill, the man who murdered his parents, although he is unaware of Chill&#x27;s true identity.

===Original plan for &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; #15===
The issue would have been a prequel to the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; episode &quot;Meltdown&quot;. Warren Powers, head of Powers Technology, acquires Mr. Freeze&#x27;s head and places it insides his vault. Warren Powers is the father of Derek Powers.

The issue would also have shown the Mr. Freeze robot killing Ferris Boyle (from the &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Heart of Ice&quot;) and Grant Walker (from the episode &quot;Deep Freeze&quot; and from &quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot; #5). Other differences include Nora&#x27;s visit with Koonak (from &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot;) happening earlier in the issue, as well as focus on the deterioration of Nightwing and Batgirl&#x27;s relationship.

===The Red Hood===
The Red Hood appears at the end of &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; vol. 2, #8. The creative team behind the story (Dan Slott and Ty Templeton) had hoped for a chance to resolve the subplot, but then the series was canceled. This version of Red Hood was supposed to be someone crucial to the DC animated universe. Slott revealed that Andrea Beaumont&#x27;s mother had faked her death in the movie. He also mentioned that the background of the character would tie into subplots concerning Lucius Fox, the Valestra crime family (from &quot;&quot;), and the Powers family (including an infant Derek Powers from &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;). Several years later, the 2020 miniseries &quot;The Batman Adventures Continue&quot;, drawn by Templeton, introduced the Jason Todd version of The Red Hood into the DCAU continuity.

==&quot;DC Classics: The Batman Adventures&quot; (2020)==
To coincide with &quot;&quot; series (see below), DC published an ongoing monthly all-ages reprint series titled &quot;DC Classics: The Batman Adventures&quot; starting with the reprinting of &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; (vol. 1) issue #1, until the series ended with issue #7 (collecting &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot; (vol. 1) issue #7). Each issue had a US $1.99 cover price. The series ran from June 2020 to December 2020 (cover dated Aug. 2020 - Feb. 2021).

*DC Classics: The Batman Adventures #1 (2020-06-09): Reprint of The Batman Adventures #1 (Penguin&#x27;s Big Score).
*DC Classics: The Batman Adventures #2 (2020-07-07): Reprint of The Batman Adventures #2 (Catwoman&#x27;s Killer Caper).

==&quot;Batman: The Adventures Continue&quot; (2020)==
Batman: The Adventures Continue is a continuation of &quot;&quot; and its follow-up &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;. The book is co-written by Paul Dini and Alan Burnett, producers of the original animated television series, and illustrated by Ty Templeton, who also worked on previous comics inspired by &quot;Batman: TAS&quot;. The limited series was initially released as a &quot;digital first&quot; comic, beginning in April 2020. The miniseries lasted eight issues. In March 2021, DC announced &quot;Season II&quot; of the series, with Issue 1 published in June 2021. As of June 2021, DC has planned seven issues for &quot;Season II&quot;.

==Additional characters==
While there were many characters who never appeared in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, the &quot;Batman Adventures&quot; series would occasionally introduce and feature characters who never made it to the screen.

<text>Louis Vuitton Malletier SAS, commonly known as Louis Vuitton (, ), is a French luxury fashion house and company founded in 1854 by Louis Vuitton. The label&#x27;s LV monogram appears on most of its products, ranging from luxury bags and leather goods to ready-to-wear, shoes, perfumes, watches, jewellery, accessories, sunglasses and books. Louis Vuitton is one of the world&#x27;s leading international fashion houses. It sells its products through standalone boutiques, lease departments in high-end departmental stores, and through the e-commerce section of its website. Louis Vuitton merged with Moët Hennessy in 1987 to create LVMH, of which it is a subsidiary.

For six consecutive years (2006–2012), Louis Vuitton was named the world&#x27;s most valuable luxury brand. Its 2012 valuation was US$25.9 billion. In 2013, the valuation of the brand was US$28.4 billion with revenue of US$9.4 billion. The company operates in 50 countries with more than 460 stores worldwide. 

Louis Vuitton has faced some episodes of criticism: continuous targeting due to its failures in ceasing forced labour, alleged mistreatment of its models in 2017, and a series of strong polemics in Barcelona, Catalonia (due to sponsoring the 2024 America&#x27;s Cup) that involved an administratively opaque fashion show, significant damages in the Park Güell&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Site, and multiple citizen protests against the company.

==History==

===Founding to World War II===
The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des Capucines in Paris. Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite trunk could be easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them lightweight and airtight. Before the introduction of Vuitton&#x27;s trunks, rounded-top trunks were used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton&#x27;s gray Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton&#x27;s style and design.

The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris. In 1871, Ōyama Iwao became the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton changed the Trianon design to a beige-and-brown stripes design in 1876. By 1885, the company opened its first store in London on Oxford Street. Soon thereafter, due to the continuing imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that reads &quot;marque L. Vuitton déposée&quot;, which translates into &quot;L. Vuitton registered trademark&quot;. In 1892, Louis Vuitton died, and the company&#x27;s management passed to his son.

After the death of his father, Georges Vuitton began a campaign to build the company into a worldwide corporation, exhibiting the company&#x27;s products at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. In 1896, the company launched the signature Monogram canvas and made the worldwide patents on it. Its graphic symbols, including quatrefoils and flowers (as well as the LV monogram), were based on the trend of using Japanese Mon designs in the late Victorian era. The patents later proved to be successful in stopping counterfeiting. In this same year, Georges travelled to the United States, where he toured cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, selling Vuitton products. In 1901, the Louis Vuitton Company introduced the &quot;Steamer Bag&quot;, a smaller piece of luggage designed to be kept inside Vuitton luggage trunks.

By 1913, the Louis Vuitton Building opened on the Champs-Elysees. It was the largest travel-goods store in the world at the time. Stores also opened in New York, Bombay, Washington, London, Alexandria, and Buenos Aires as World War I began. Afterwards, in 1930, the Keepall bag was introduced. During 1932, LV introduced the &quot;Noé&quot; bag. This bag was originally made for champagne vintners to transport bottles. Soon thereafter, the Louis Vuitton &quot;Speedy&quot; bag was introduced (both are still manufactured today). In 1936 Georges Vuitton died, and his son, Gaston-Louis Vuitton, assumed control of the company.

===WWII Nazi collaboration===

During World War II, Louis Vuitton collaborated with the Nazis during the German occupation of France. The French book &quot;Louis Vuitton, A French Saga&quot;, authored by French journalist Stephanie Bonvicini and published by Paris-based Editions Fayard, tells how members of the Vuitton family actively aided the Vichy government led by Marshal Philippe Pétain and increased their wealth from their business affairs with the Germans. The family set up a factory dedicated to producing artefacts glorifying Pétain, including more than 2,500 busts.

Caroline Babulle, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Fayard, said: &quot;They have not contested anything in the book, but they are trying to bury it by pretending it doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; Responding to the book&#x27;s release in 2004, a spokesman for LVMH said: &quot;This is ancient history. The book covers a period when it was family-run and long before it became part of LVMH. We are diverse, tolerant and all the things a modern company should be.&quot; An LVMH spokesman told the satirical magazine &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot;: &quot;We don&#x27;t deny the facts, but regrettably the author has exaggerated the Vichy episode. We haven&#x27;t put any pressure on anyone. If the journalists want to censor themselves, then that suits us fine.&quot; That publication was the only French periodical to mention the book, possibly because LVMH is the country&#x27;s biggest advertiser in the press.

===1945 through 2000===
During this period, Louis Vuitton began to incorporate leather into most of its products, which ranged from small purses and wallets to larger pieces of luggage. In order to broaden its line, the company revamped its signature Monogram canvas in 1959 to make it more supple, allowing it to be used for purses, bags, and wallets. It is believed that in the 1920s, counterfeiting returned as a greater issue to continue on into the 21st century. In 1966, the &quot;Papillon&quot; was launched (a cylindrical bag that is still popular today). By 1977 with annual revenue up to 70 million Francs (US$14.27 million). A year later, the label opened its first stores in Japan: in Tokyo and Osaka. In 1983, the company joined with America&#x27;s Cup to form the Louis Vuitton Cup, a preliminary competition (known as an eliminatory regatta) for the yacht race. Louis Vuitton later expanded its presence in Asia with the opening of a store in Taipei, Taiwan in 1983 and Seoul, South Korea in 1984. In the following year, 1985, the Epi leather line was introduced.

1987 saw the creation of LVMH. Moët et Chandon and Hennessy, leading manufacturers of champagne and cognac, merged respectively with Louis Vuitton to form the luxury goods conglomerate. Profits for 1988 were reported to have been up by 49% more than in 1987. By 1989, Louis Vuitton came to operate 130 stores worldwide. Entering the 1990s, Yves Carcelle was named president of LV, and in 1992, Louis Vuitton entered mainland China by opening its first store in Beijing at the Palace Hotel. Further products became introduced such as the Taiga leather line in 1993, and the literature collection of &quot;Voyager Avec...&quot; in 1994. In 1996, the celebration of the Centennial of the Monogram canvas was held in seven cities worldwide.

In 1997, Louis Vuitton made Marc Jacobs its Artistic Director. In March of the following year, he designed and introduced the company&#x27;s first &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot; line of clothing for men and women. Also in this year products introduced included the Monogram Vernis line, the LV scrapbooks, and the &quot;Louis Vuitton City Guide&quot;.

The last events in the 20th century were the release of the mini monogram line in 1999. The opening of the first store in Africa in Marrakech, Morocco, in 2000. Finally, the auction at the International Film Festival in Venice, Italy, where the vanity case &quot;amfAR&quot; designed by Sharon Stone was sold, with the proceeds going to the Foundation for AIDS Research (also in 2000).

===2001 to 2011===
By 2001, Stephen Sprouse, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, designed a limited-edition line of Vuitton bags that featured graffiti written over the monogram pattern. The graffiti read &quot;Louis Vuitton&quot; and, on certain bags, the name of the bag (such as Keepall and Speedy). Certain pieces, which featured the graffiti without the Monogram canvas background, were only available on Louis Vuitton&#x27;s V.I.P. customer list. Jacobs also created the charm bracelet, the first-ever piece of jewellery from LV, within the same year.

In 2002, the Tambour watch collection was introduced. During this year, the LV building in Tokyo&#x27;s Ginza district was opened, and the brand collaborated with Bob Wilson for its Christmas windows scenography. In 2003, Takashi Murakami, in collaboration with Marc Jacobs, masterminded the new Monogram Multicolore canvas range of handbags and accessories. This range included the monograms of the standard Monogram canvas but in 33 different colours on either a white or black background. (The classic canvas features gold monograms on a brown background.) Murakami also created the Cherry Blossom pattern, in which smiling cartoon faces in the middle of pink and yellow flowers were sporadically placed atop the Monogram canvas. This pattern appeared on a limited number of pieces. The production of this limited-edition run was discontinued in June 2003. Within 2003, the stores in Moscow, Russia, and in New Delhi, India were opened, the Utah and Suhali leather lines were released, and the 20th anniversary of the LV Cup was held.

In 2004, Louis Vuitton celebrated its 150th anniversary. The brand also inaugurated stores in New York City (on Fifth Avenue), São Paulo, Mexico City, Cancun and Johannesburg. It also opened its first global store in Shanghai. By 2005, Louis Vuitton reopened its Champs-Élysées store in Paris designed by the American Architect Eric Carlson and released the Speedy watch collection. In 2006, LV held the inauguration of the Espace Louis Vuitton on its 7th floor. In 2008, Louis Vuitton released the Damier Graphite canvas. The canvas features the classic Damier pattern but in black and grey, giving it a masculine look and urban feel. Also in 2008, Pharrell Williams co-designed a series of jewellery (&quot;Blason&quot;) and glasses for Louis Vuitton.

In 2010, Louis Vuitton opened what is described as their most luxurious store in London.

In early 2011, Louis Vuitton hired Kim Jones as its &quot;Men Ready-to-Wear Studio and Style Director&quot;. He became the lead designer of menswear while working under the company-wide artistic directorship of Marc Jacobs.

On 17 September 2011, the company opened its Louis Vuitton Island &quot;Maison&quot; at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.

===2012 to present===
, the company hired Darren Spaziani to lead its accessory collection.

On 4 November 2013, the company confirmed that Nicolas Ghesquière had been hired to replace Marc Jacobs as artistic director of women&#x27;s collections. Ghesquière&#x27;s first line for the company was shown in Paris in March 2014.

On 7 April 2014, Edouard Schneider became the head of press and public relations at Louis Vuitton under Frédéric Winckler, who is Vuitton&#x27;s communications and events director.

On 26 March 2018, Virgil Abloh was named artistic director of men&#x27;s wear, replacing Kim Jones who had departed for Dior—he was the label&#x27;s first African-American artistic director and one of few black designers of a major European fashion house. His debut show was held at the 2018 Paris Men&#x27;s Fashion Week and staged in the historical Palais-Royal gardens&#x27; courtyard.

On 28 November 2021, Abloh died of cardiac angiosarcoma, which he had been battling privately for two years prior.

LV was in the first place in the BrandZ&#x27;s top 10 most valuable luxury brands in 2019, with a worth of $47.2 billion.
On 15 January 2020, the company acquired the Sewelô diamond, which is the third-largest rough diamond ever found in history, from Lucara Diamond who mined it from their mine in Botswana.

In March 2022, LVMH announced closure of its 120+ stores in Russia, &quot;given the current circumstances in the region,&quot; due to the Russo-Ukrainian War. An LVMH spokesperson stated the company would continue to pay salary and benefits to its 3,500 employees in Russia.

On 14 February 2023, Pharrell Williams was named creative director of men&#x27;s wear.

==Brand and intellectual property==
The Louis Vuitton brand and the LV monogram are among the world&#x27;s most valuable brands.

According to a Millward Brown 2010 study, Louis Vuitton was then the world&#x27;s 19th most valuable brand, and was estimated to be worth over US$19 billion. For six consecutive years, Louis Vuitton was number one of the 10 most powerful brands list published by the Millward Brown Optimor&#x27;s 2011 BrandZ study with value of $24.3 billion. It was more than double the value of the second ranking brand.

Louis Vuitton is one of the most counterfeited brands in the fashion world due to its image as a status symbol. Ironically, the signature Monogram canvas was created to prevent counterfeiting. In 2004, Louis Vuitton fakes accounted for 18% of counterfeit accessories seized in the European Union.

The company actively seeks to eradicate counterfeiting, and employs a team of lawyers and special investigation agencies to pursue offenders through the courts worldwide. The company allocates approximately half of its communications budget to counteract counterfeiting of its goods. LVMH, Vuitton&#x27;s parent company, has described &quot;Some 60 people at various levels of responsibility working full-time on anti-counterfeiting in collaboration with a wide network of outside investigators and a team of lawyers.&quot; The company closely controls the distribution of its products. Until the 1980s, Vuitton products were widely sold in department stores, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. Today, Vuitton products are primarily available at company-owned Louis Vuitton boutiques, with a small number of exceptions noted in upscale shopping districts or inside luxury department stores. Company boutiques within department stores operate independently, and are operated by company managers and employees. LV has an official online store, through its main website.

In 2006, the company filed a lawsuit against Colorado-based Manifest Information Services Ltd. (aka Manifest Hostmaster and Manifest.com), through WIPO, in order to compel Manifest transfer the domain name LV.com to Louis Vuitton; the legal action failed and the domain was subsequently acquired by Liverpool Victoria (LV=), England&#x27;s largest fraternal insurance company.

Several high-profile rap music artists have mentioned the company in song lyrics, most notably: Kanye West, Juicy J, and Wiz Khalifa.

Louis Vuitton has been operating in China for 30 years and nowadays the country is the main market for the French maison, boasting about 40 offline stores nationwide.

===&quot;Simple Living&quot;===
On 13 February 2007, Louis Vuitton sent a cease-and-desist order to Danish art student Nadia Plesner for using an image of a bag that allegedly infringed Louis Vuitton&#x27;s intellectual property rights. Plesner had created a satirical illustration, &quot;Simple Living&quot;, depicting a malnourished child holding a designer dog and a designer bag, and used it on T-shirts and posters to raise funds for the charity &quot;Divest for Darfur&quot;. On 25 March, the court ruled in favour of LV that the image was a clear infringement of copyright. Despite the ruling, Plesner continued to use the image, arguing artistic freedom, and posted copies of the cease-and-desist order on her website. On 15 April 2008, Louis Vuitton notified Plesner of the lawsuit being brought against her. Louis Vuitton demanded $7,500 (€5,000) for each day Plesner continues to sell the &quot;Simple Living&quot; products, $7,500 for each day the original cease-and-desist letter is published on her website and $7,500 a day for using the name &quot;Louis Vuitton&quot; on her website, plus legal and enforcement costs.

An LVMH spokeswoman interviewed by &quot;New York Magazine&quot; said that Louis Vuitton were forced to take legal action when Plesner did not respond to their original request to remove the contested image, nor to the subsequent cease-and-desist order. In October 2008, Louis Vuitton declared that the company had dropped its lawsuit but have since reopened it along with a new €205,000 claim due to a painting by the same artist. In May 2011, the court in The Hague found in favour of Plesner&#x27;s right to freedom of expression.

===Britney Spears video===
On 19 November 2007 Louis Vuitton, in further efforts to prevent counterfeiting, successfully sued Britney Spears for violating anti-counterfeiting laws. A part of the music video for the song &quot;Do Somethin&#x27;&quot; shows fingers tapping on the dashboard of a hot pink Hummer with what looks like Louis Vuitton&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Blossom&quot; design bearing the LV logo. Britney Spears herself was not found liable, but a civil court in Paris ordered Sony BMG and MTV Online to stop showing the video. They were also fined €80,000 to each group. An anonymous spokesperson for LVMH stated that the video constituted an &quot;attack&quot; on Louis Vuitton&#x27;s brands and its luxury image.

===S-Lock copyright in Hong Kong===
In another legal warning dated back to September 2012, Louis Vuitton had filed complaints against two small retail shops in Hong Kong for allegedly violating its intellectual property rights in relation to the &quot;S-Lock&quot; design for Louis Vuitton&#x27;s handbags.
According to the Hong Kong-based &quot;Apple Daily&quot; newspaper, the company was seeking compensation of HK$40,000 (around $US 5,000) and a public apology in the newspaper. The shopkeeper refused to pay, and Louis Vuitton demanded further damages up to HK$150,000 in February 2013. The shop claimed to have sourced two such handbags from Japan at around HK$120, which it retailed at HK$220.
In the case of the other small shop selling two handbags, they argued with Louis Vuitton that the designs were different, and got LV&#x27;s demand reduced to HK$5,000 (around US$640). The owner refused to pay and said they were ready to face LV in court.
===Checker-pattern chair in Hong Kong barber shop===
In February 2013, Louis Vuitton issued a complaint against the owner of a barber shop in Hong Kong for allegedly violating its intellectual property rights in relation to a stool using fabric coating that is similar to the checker pattern in Louis Vuitton&#x27;s handbags. According to the Hong Kong-based &quot;Apple Daily&quot; newspaper, the company was seeking a compensation of HK$25,000 (around US$3,200) and the publication of an apology in the form of newspaper advertisement. The owner had sourced basic furniture and equipment from the PRC for starting his shop. Facing this accusation, the barbershop owner said he had no means to tackle Louis Vuitton and may have to close down his shop which has been operating for one year in a remote local district on Hong Kong Island.
The controversy had caused tremendous concern on Hong Kong news forums and viral protest on Facebook pages.

===2021 patent ruling in Japan===
On 14 April 2021, Louis Vuitton lost a patent office case in Japan against a Japanese manufacturer. The manufacturer was using centuries old Japanese designs in its goods, the same ones that had originally inspired Louis Vuitton. The Sarah wallet design in particular resembles bag designs that have been used for centuries to contain juzu (strings of beads used in funeral ceremonies - see Japamala#Japanese Buddhism). There has been comment on Japanese social media concerning how the company management seems to have forgotten the origins of Louis Vuitton&#x27;s designs. The Shoso-in archive has a biwa lute with marquetry patterns to which some Louis Vuitton&#x27;s designs bear a close resemblance.

==Products==

Since the 19th century, Louis Vuitton trunks have been made by hand. &quot;Contemporary Fashion&quot; gives a preview of the creation of the LV trunks: The craftsmen line up the leather and canvas, tapping in the tiny nails one by one and securing the five-letter solid pick-proof brass locks with an individual handmade key, designed to allow the traveller to have only one key for all of his or her luggage. The wooden frames of each trunk are made of 30-year-old poplar that has been allowed to dry for at least four years. Each trunk has a serial number and can take up to 60 hours to make, and a suitcase as many as 15 hours.

Iconic bags of Louis Vuitton include the Speedy bag produced in 1930 and Neverfull bags produced in 2007. Both bags have become Louis Vuitton&#x27;s most successful handbag launches. They were designed for being both stylish and practical. These bags also come in three sizes: Petite Modele, Moyene Modele, and Grand Modele. Each season Louis Vuitton produces rare, limited edition bags that are generally only available by reservation through larger Louis Vuitton stores.

Many of the company&#x27;s products utilize the brown Damier and Monogram canvas materials, both of which were first used in the late 19th century. All of the company&#x27;s products exhibit the eponymous LV initials. The company markets its product through its own stores located throughout the world, which allows it to control product quality and pricing. It also allows LV to prevent counterfeit products entering its distribution channels. In addition, the company distributes its products through the company&#x27;s own website, LouisVuitton.com.

In June 2021, Louis Vuitton sparked controversy by marketing a $700 scarf called &#x27;Monogram Keffieh&#x27;. The traditional Palestinian black and white keffiyeh has been a symbol of Palestinian nationalism since 1968. Louis Vuitton, however, changed the colours from the original black and white to blue and white which Palestinians and pro-Palestine social media activists called the colours of the flag of Israel, sporting with House signature patterns which was described as &#x27;disgraceful&#x27;. Some users of Twitter began to tweet memes using the quote &quot;If I don&#x27;t steal it, someone else will&quot; from a repatriated Israeli citizen who had recently gone viral for trying to illegally occupy the home of a Palestinian. Another user accused Louis Vuitton for being politically neutral when it came to Palestine and Israel but &quot;totally cool&quot; with profiting off of the keffiyeh.
In 2017 Louis Vuitton made headlines for producing a men&#x27;s collection using prints similar to those of the Basotho blanket and to the designs of Thabo Makhetha-Kwinana, a controversial move that sparked accusations of cultural appropriation in South Africa and Lesotho.

==Advertising campaigns==
The Louis Vuitton company cultivates a celebrity following and has featured famous models, musicians and actors, such as Lea Seydoux, Jennifer Lopez, Keith Richards, Kim Kardashian, Madonna, Sean Connery, Matthias Schoenaerts, Angelina Jolie, Gisele Bündchen, Mikhail Gorbachev, JO1 and David Bowie in its marketing campaigns.

The company commonly uses print ads in magazines and billboards in cosmopolitan cities. Louis Vuitton Posters by Razzia were popular in the 1980s. It previously relied on selected press for its advertising campaigns (frequently involving prestigious stars like Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Catherine Deneuve) shot by Annie Leibovitz. However, Antoine Arnault, director of the communication department, has recently decided to enter the world of television and cinema: The commercial (90 seconds) is exploring the theme &quot;Where will life take you?&quot; and is translated into 13 different languages. This is the first Vuitton commercial ad ever and was directed by renowned French ad director Bruno Aveillan.

In 2002, president and CEO of LVMH Watches Daniel Lalonde (later, global CEO for LVMH brands Moët and Dom Pérignon) recruited celebrities, such as Maria Sharapova, Brad Pitt, Tiger Woods, and Uma Thurman, for advertising campaigns photographed by Patrick Demarchelier. Ads featuring Woods reportedly led to a 30% boost in sales, resulting in TAG Heuer being rated as the No. 2 luxury watch brand in America by 2005.

In 2021, French actress and Louis Vuitton house ambassador Lea Seydoux wore a custom designed dress by Nicolas Ghesquière to the James Bond No Time to Die premiere in London. The dress itself took over 520 hours to make and the design was consisted of a white silk gown which featured a sparkling chiffon cape. The dress also included 29,000 sequins, 50,000 cuvettes and over 8800 glass beads which were carefully set on the dress. In the same year, the luxury brand released an NFT mobile game titled &quot;Louis the Game&quot; to celebrate its founder&#x27;s 200th birthday and in an effort to reach out to its younger, Gen-Z audience.
In 2022, Deepika Padukone was roped in as House Ambassador.

Louis Vuitton&#x27;s parent company LVMH is set to enter Formula One from the 2025 season onward, with the brand set to sponsor the Australian Grand Prix from 2025 onward.

Sho Hirano of Japanese group Number_i was appointed as brand ambassador for the Japanese side of the brand on January 7, 2025. On his role as ambassador, Hirano said: “Louis Vuitton has been a brand I’ve admired for years, and I’m thrilled to be involved in future projects. I hope to share the charm of this iconic Maison in my own way. Let’s explore the world of Louis Vuitton together.” Hirano was in Paris for the brand&#x27;s Fall/Winter 2025 campaign.

==Special collaborations==
Louis Vuitton has had many collaborations with prominent artists and designers.

* Takashi Murakami created special edition collections, such as the Monogramouflage Collection, which debuted in 2008, and a previous collection, released in 2002, which featured some of his artwork. The creations were &quot;painted&quot; over the traditional monogram canvas, which brought a radical new twist to the timeless design. 
* Marc Jacobs also commemorated a previous collaboration, designed by Stephen Sprouse. This collection, originally released in 2001, featured bold print that looked like graffiti, over the traditional canvas. The recreation of the collab used the same idea, but gave it a new twist using bold colours, like hot pink, neon green, and orange, that also glow in the dark. This recreated version of the graffiti collection was finally released in 2009 to much fanfare.
* Louis Vuitton also collaborated with Kanye West in 2009, designing his own limited run of shoes. 
* In July 2012, Jacobs teamed up with Yayoi Kusama to create the &quot;Infinitely Kusama&quot; Collection, which features bold colours of dots over the vernis leather or the Monogram canvas. These pieces come in black with white dots, red with white dots, and yellow with black dots.
* Louis Vuitton collaborated in their Spring–Summer 2016 collection advertising campaign with the highly popular Japanese video game franchise Final Fantasy and the game Final Fantasy XIII&#x27;s main heroine, Lightning. 
* In 2017 Louis Vuitton collaborated with American streetwear brand Supreme, releasing products in various pop-up stores in major cities around the world. Items feature the Louis Vuitton Monogram canvas mixed with the Supreme box-logo design.

* Also in 2017, Louis Vuitton collaborated with artist Jeff Koons for two collections in an effort to &quot;further [explore] the intersection of fashion and art.&quot; 
* Nicolas Ghesquiere collaborated with Vogue creative director Grace Coddington on a cat-themed &quot;Catogram&quot; collection in 2018.
* In June 2019, the brand collaborated with six contemporary artists Sam Falls, Urs Fischer, Nicholas Hlobo, Alex Israel, Tschabalala Self and Jonas Wood on &quot;Artycapucines.&quot; Each artist designed their version of the Capucine bag which were sold in numbered, limited quantities.
* In July 2019, Louis Vuitton opened a temporary exhibition titled &quot;Louis Vuitton X&quot; in Los Angeles, showcasing items from its various collaborations over the years.
* In October 2019, Louis Vuitton partnered with Riot Games to create digital assets for new skin line named &quot;True Damage&quot;, where you can clearly see the LV logo on Qiyana in League of Legends, along with a specialty trophy case for the 2019 League of Legends World Championship.
* In June 2020, the brand collaborated with Japanese designer Nigo x Virgil Abloh capsule collection.
* In October 2020, Nicolas Ghesquière reportedly revamped the La Samaritaine department store for the Women&#x27;s Spring-Summer 2021 fashion show by providing a virtual runway with 360-degree views and social-distanced seating for guests.
* In March 2024, Tyler Okonma (a.k.a. Tyler, The Creator) collaborated with Louis Vuitton to create their 2024 Spring collection.

==Criticism==

=== Alleged mistreatment of models ===
In May 2017, media reported on alleged mistreatment of Louis Vuitton exclusive model Ulrikke Høyer who was to appear on a Louis Vuitton cruise show in Kyoto. The 20-year-old model, who, on arrival, measured around her hips, was told she was &quot;too bloated&quot; and &quot;too big&quot; for her ensemble and instructed to drink only water for 24 hours. The model alleged that she was only informed via her agent in France, who received an email including the text &quot;[she] came yesterday in Tokyo to do her final fitting, and she doesn&#x27;t fit the exact same dress anymore. She has a belly, her face is more puffy [sic] and the back of her dress is open and you can see it is tight.&quot; Despite following the instructions, she was eventually excluded from the show. The model stated that she has &quot;received hundreds of messages from models&quot; who have experienced similar mistreatment from the same Louis Vuitton casting director. The casting director denied the allegations and explained the instructions regarding intake of water as a misunderstanding, that the model was instructed that her intake of liquids was to be limited to water.

=== Damaging and opaque privatization of UNESCO historic heritage ===
Few years later, in May 2024, a strong polemic was reported by the media due to the fashion show organized by Louis Vuitton in Barcelona, Catalonia, as a result of its main sponsorship in the 2024 America&#x27;s Cup hosted in this city. The company managed to organize the event inside the Antoni Gaudi&#x27;s authored gardens Park Güell, declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, despite the public regulations that strictly limited its activities to &quot;scientific and educative purposes&quot;. The week before the show, the technical contractors were found to have destroyed the wall of a protected stairway and a stone ball. The negligence, however, was only admitted after the damage had been denounced and published in the press by the neighborhood association. The residents&#x27; platform criticized that neither the company, nor the contractors or the City Council of Barcelona had informed them about such big occasion neither its impact.

The tension between the public opinion, the City Council and the organizer quickly escalated the immediate days before the show, especially after the neighbors knew that both the park and the nearby streets would remain closed during the event and due to the lack of transparency in the whole process. In addition, the neighboring schools were forced to close earlier, denied their after-school activities and the access of families were limited with mandatory ID checkups. The situation significantly worsened the already fragile, social environment in the area, which had already been suffering from touristification and gentrification in the past years. The public company that operates the privatized access of the park, BSM, refused to disclose whether Louis Vuitton had paid or not for the event. It alleged a non-disclosure agreement, while representatives of the mayor, Jaume Collboni (Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia), defended the show as a &quot;positive promotion for the city to the world&quot;.

Both the evenings before, and during the day of the fashion show, hundreds of inhabitants protested in the flagship Louis Vuitton shop of Barcelona (Passeig de Gràcia) and in the outskirts of Park Güell. They blocked the access of the shop and displayed banners such as &quot;Your luxury, our misery&quot;, celebrated &quot;cassolades,&quot; and demonstrated few times in front of the gardens&#x27; main doors against the company and the City Council. A day before, it was also disclosed by investigative journalists &quot;Octuvre&quot; that Louis Vuitton had secretly pressured and achieved the free usage of the part as a sponsorship deal for the America&#x27;s Cup: it was later published by the press that a tailor-made secret decree was concocted so that the parade could fit in as an act of public interest. At the arrival of the show attendants to the venue on May 23, hundreds of protesters, mostly activists, neighbors, and families, gathered in the surroundings of the park and attempted to peacefully trespass the police cordon. The tension increased and the demonstration ended with police charges, while the event (&quot;Cruise 2025 Collection;&quot; in Catalan &quot;Col·lecció Creuer 2025&quot;) was finally celebrated in the &quot;Sala Hipòstila&quot; of Gaudi&#x27;s park premises. During the gala reception of the show, VIP guests by Louis Vuitton were, however, photographed by the media mocking and even mooning the outside protesters from a viewpoint of the park.

<text>All Star Comics is an American comic book series from All-American Publications, one of three companies that merged with National Periodical Publications to form the modern-day DC Comics. While the series&#x27; cover-logo trademark reads &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, its copyrighted title as indicated by postal indicia is &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;, with a hyphen. With the exception of the first two issues, &quot;All Star Comics&quot; told stories about the adventures of the Justice Society of America, the first team of superheroes. It also introduced Wonder Woman.

== Publication history ==
===Original series===

The original concept for &quot;All Star Comics&quot; was an anthology title containing the most popular series from the other anthology titles published by both All-American Publications and National Comics. 

&quot;All Star Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated Summer 1940) contained superhero stories that included All-American&#x27;s Golden Age Flash, Hawkman, Ultra-Man, as well as National&#x27;s Hour-Man, Spectre, and Sandman. The adventure strip &quot;Biff Bronson&quot; and the comedy-adventure &quot;Red, White, and Blue&quot; also premiered with the Summer 1940 cover date.

Issue #3 (Winter 1940–1941) depicted the first meeting of the Justice Society of America, with its members swapping stories of their exploits which were subsequently illustrated in the comic&#x27;s array of solo adventures. In addition to the Flash, Hawkman, Hour-Man, the Spectre, and the Sandman were Doctor Fate from National&#x27;s &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; and the Green Lantern and the Atom from All-American&#x27;s flagship title &quot;All-American Comics&quot;. The Justice Society of America (JSA) was originally a frame story used to present an anthology of solo stories about the individual characters, with each story handled by a different artist. Comic historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;this was obviously a great notion, since it offered readers a lot of headliners for a dime, and also the fun of watching fan favorites interact&quot;. The anthology format was dropped in 1947 and replaced with full issue stories featuring the heroes teaming up to fight crime.

&quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (cover dated January 1942) featured the first appearance of Wonder Woman in an eight-page story written by William Moulton Marston, under the pen name of &quot;Charles Moulton&quot; with art by H. G. Peter. The insert story was included to test reader interest in the Wonder Woman concept. It generated enough positive fan response that Wonder Woman would be awarded the lead feature in the &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; anthology title starting from issue #1. That same issue saw the induction of Doctor Mid-Nite and Starman as members of the Justice Society as well. Starting with issue #11, Wonder Woman would appear in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; as a member of the Justice Society as their secretary. 

With issue #34 (April–May 1947), Gardner Fox left the series and a new super-villain, the Wizard, was introduced. The Injustice Society first battled the JSA in issue #37 in a tale written by Robert Kanigher. The Black Canary guest starred in issue #38 and joined the team three issues later in #41. 

&quot;All Star Comics&quot; increased its frequency from a quarterly to a bimonthly publication schedule, and the JSA lasted through March 1951 with issue #57 in a story titled &quot;The Mystery of the Vanishing Detectives&quot;.

Superhero comics slumped in the early 1950s, and &quot;All Star Comics&quot; was renamed &quot;All-Star Western&quot; in 1951 with issue #58. In this issue, the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; feature was replaced by Western heroes.

Artwork from an unpublished &quot;All Star Comics&quot; story titled &quot;The Will of William Wilson&quot; had survived and was printed in various publications from TwoMorrows Publishing.

===1976 revival series===
In 1976, the name &quot;All Star Comics&quot; was resurrected for a series portraying the modern-day adventures of the JSA. The new series dismissed the numbering from &quot;All-Star Western&quot; and continued the original numbering, premiering with &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #58. Starting with issue #66, a hyphen was added to the title and the words &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; became a much smaller part of the cover; while the words &quot;Justice Society&quot; became much larger. The 1970s series introduced the new characters Power Girl and the Helena Wayne version of the Huntress. This series ran for seventeen issues before it was abruptly canceled with issue #74 as part of the DC Implosion and the JSA&#x27;s adventures were folded into &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;.

After 23-year-old Gerry Conway became an editor at DC Comics, long-time JSA-fan Roy Thomas suggested to Conway that the JSA be given their own title again. Conway offered Thomas a chance to ghostwrite an issue of the revived &quot;All-Star Comics&quot;, but he declined as Thomas was under an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics at the time. However, in 1981 Thomas moved to DC and was able to work with the characters.

===Subsequent revival===
A two-issue &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; series was published as a part of the &quot;Justice Society Returns&quot; storyline in May 1999.

<text>Peggy&#x27;s Cove is a small rural community located on the eastern shore of St. Margarets Bay in the Halifax Regional Municipality, which is the site of Peggys Cove Lighthouse (established 1868).

==Geography==

Peggy&#x27;s Cove is southwest of Downtown Halifax and comprises one of the numerous small fishing communities located around the perimeter of the Chebucto Peninsula.

The community is named after the cove of the same name, a name also shared with Peggy&#x27;s Point, immediately to the east of the cove. The village marks the eastern point of the St. Margarets Bay.

==History==

The first recorded name of the cove was Eastern Point Harbour or Peggs Harbour in 1766. The village is likely named after Saint Margaret&#x27;s Bay (Peggy being a nickname for Margaret), which Samuel de Champlain named after his mother Marguerite Le Roy. There has been much folklore created to explain the name.

One story suggests the village may have been named after the wife of an early settler. The popular legend claims that the name came from the sole survivor of a shipwreck at Halibut Rock near the cove. Artist and resident William deGarthe said she was a young woman while others claim she was a little girl too young to remember her name and the family who adopted her called her Peggy. The young shipwreck survivor married a resident of the cove in 1800 and became known as &quot;Peggy of the Cove&quot;, attracting visitors from around the bay who eventually named the village Peggy&#x27;s Cove, after her nickname.

The village was founded in 1811 when the province of Nova Scotia issued a land grant of more than to six families of German descent. The settlers relied on fishing as the mainstay of their economy but also farmed where the soil was fertile. They used surrounding lands to pasture cattle. In the early 1900s the population peaked at about 300. The community supported a schoolhouse, church, general store, lobster cannery and boats of all sizes that were nestled in the cove.

Many artists and photographers flocked to Peggy&#x27;s Cove. As roads improved, the number of tourists increased. Today the population is smaller but Peggy&#x27;s Cove remains an active fishing village and a favourite tourist destination.

Roads and several homes were badly damaged at Peggy&#x27;s Cove in 2003 by the extensive flooding that accompanied Hurricane Juan, which also damaged the cove&#x27;s breakwater. The breakwater was further washed away by Hurricane Bill in 2009, allowing waves to seriously damage a home and gift shop, and washed away one of the cove&#x27;s characteristic wooden fish sheds.

In January 2021, the federal and provincial governments announced the construction of a $3.1 million accessible viewing platform at Peggy&#x27;s Cove, to open in June 2021. The large platform area officially opened in October 2021; while visitors are allowed to walk on the rocks too, the 1,300-square-metre deck area is safer. At that time, other changes were still pending, based on a draft Master Plan for infrastructure improvement.

==Tourism==
From its inception, the community&#x27;s economy revolved around fishery. However, tourism began to overtake fishing in economic importance following the Second World War. Today, Peggy&#x27;s Cove is a major tourist attraction, although its inhabitants still fish for lobster, and the community maintains a rustic undeveloped appearance. The regional municipality and the provincial government have strict land-use regulations in the vicinity of Peggy&#x27;s Cove, with most property development being prohibited. Similarly there are restrictions on who can live in the community to prevent inflation of property values for year-round residents.

The historic Carpenter Gothic style St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church, the only church in Peggy&#x27;s Cove, is a municipally designated heritage site.
The first public art gallery, tea-room, and gift shop was opened in a shack in Peggy&#x27;s Cove in 1937.

==Geology==

More than 400 million years ago, in the Devonian Period, the plate tectonics movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust allowed molten material to bubble up from the Earth&#x27;s interior. This formed the rocks seen today and are part of the Great Nova Scotia batholith. The landscape of Peggy&#x27;s Cove and surrounding areas was subsequently carved by the migration of glaciers and the ocean tides.

About 20,000 years ago, an ice ridge moved south from Canada&#x27;s Arctic region covering much of North America. Along with the ebb and flow of the glaciers, the ice ridge eventually melted and shifted and in the process scooped away and scoured large sections of rock, vegetation and topsoil. As melted land glaciers flowed back to the oceans the changing tidal flows and rising sea levels filled the scarred areas with water, forming coves and inlets.

Large boulders composed of 415-million-year-old Devonian granite, called glacial erratics, were lifted by the ice and carried for long distances before being deposited upon the landscape as the ice receded, leaving rugged barrens. The movement of the glacial ice and rocks left scouring marks in the bedrock that are still visible.

Peggy&#x27;s Cove has been declared a preservation area to protect its rugged beauty. The Peggy&#x27;s Cove Commission Act, passed in 1962, prohibits development in and around the surrounding village and restricts development within Peggy&#x27;s Cove. The area comprised about stretching from Indian Harbour to West Dover and includes barrens, bogs, inland ponds, and rocky coastline.

==Atlantic Ocean==
The Atlantic tide runs about . The ocean temperature ranges between in the summer and falls to between in the winter. The ocean moderates the air temperature over the land year round.

The shape of the ocean floor and the numerous ocean currents facilitate a rich diversity of marine life along the Atlantic coastline. The Labrador Current flowing south from the Arctic cools the ocean during the summer months. Offshore, the Gulf Stream, travelling northwest from the Caribbean to the northern Europe warms the ocean waters. The confluence of currents off Nova Scotia brings unusual Arctic and tropical species to St. Margarets Bay. Marine life includes Atlantic bluefin tuna, white-sided and white-beaked dolphins, and pinnipeds. Endangered Atlantic leatherback sea turtles are seen in the waters near shore. Endangered right whales and many other species are found in the waters.

==Cultural impact==
The cove was the scene of a youth novel by Bryan Doyle called &quot;You Can Pick Me up at Peggy&#x27;s Cove&quot; (1976), which was made into a film directed by Don McBrearty and into a video released by Beacon Films, Inc., in 1982.

In 2016 it was announced that a Peggy&#x27;s Cove–themed resort had opened in Thailand.

===William deGarthe===
Sculptor and painter William E. deGarthe lived in Peggy&#x27;s Cove. A gallery exhibiting his work is open to the public between May 1 and October 31 each year. Outside the gallery, in the William E. deGarthe Provincial Park, is a carved granite outcropping. This sculpture was carved by deGarthe as &quot;a lasting monument to Nova Scotian fishermen&quot;. It depicts 32 fishermen, their wives, and children enveloped by the wings of Saint Elmo, the patron saint of sailors, as well as the legendary Peggy.

==Swissair Flight 111==
On September 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed into St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay approximately eight kilometres (five miles) southwest of Peggy&#x27;s Cove with the loss of all 229 aboard. The cove became one of the staging areas for first responders that were involved in the search-and-rescue response, crash recovery operation, and investigation of the crash. Many of the CCGA volunteers that were first to approach the crash site were privately owned fishing boats that were operating out of Peggy&#x27;s Cove and surrounding harbours. In the days following the crash many families and media came to Peggy&#x27;s Cove to see the crash site. Some of the victims&#x27; family members were displeased with the plans for burial of unidentified remains, believing they should have been buried at the site of the memorial.

<text>The Daughters of Hawaii is a nonprofit organization founded in 1903, dedicated to the preservation of Hawaiian culture, language, and sacred and historic sites. They run the Hulihee Palace and the Queen Emma Summer Palace (Hānaiakamalama).

== History ==
The organization was established in 1903 by seven women who were daughters of American Protestant missionaries. Born in Hawaii, they were citizens of the Kingdom of Hawaii before annexation. Forseeing the inevitable loss of much of the Hawaiian culture, they founded the organization &quot;to perpetuate the memory and spirit of old Hawaii and of historic facts, and to preserve the nomenclature and correct pronunciation of the Hawaiian language.&quot;

Hānaiakamalama, now known as the Queen Emma Summer Palace was the &quot;mountain&quot; home of Queen Emma Na&#x27;ea, wife of Kamehameha IV. She had inherited it from her uncle, John Young II, son of the famous advisor to Kamehameha I, John Young I. Queen Emma used the home as a retreat where she could escape from the oppressive heat of Honolulu into the coolness of Nuuanu. The Queen Emma Summer Palace was acquired by the Daughters of Hawaii in 1913, narrowly avoiding the demolition of the house and construction of a baseball field on the grounds. The Territorial Government granted the Daughters the use of the home and of the grounds as long as the home was used and maintained as a museum.

Having acquired and restored Hānaiakamalama, the Daughters set about to save Hulihe‘e Palace in 1924. The Palace was in ruins. The grounds were so overgrown that the house could not be seen from the road. In 1925, the Territorial Legislature purchased Hulihe‘e and set it aside for the Daughters to use and maintain as a museum. When the Daughters finally took over Hulihee in 1927, there was little interest in historic preservation in the islands. At this time, the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company began to formulate plans for an oceanfront hotel in Kailua-Kona. They decided that the Hulihee grounds was the most desirable location in Kailua-Kona and at once began to pressure the Daughters to relinquish Hulihee. The ladies held firm and because of their spirit, the State of Hawaii has an important educational museum and Kailua-Kona still has some open waterfront. Hulihee Palace was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
The Daughters of Hawaii also own and maintain the site of Kamehameha III&#x27;s birth at Keauhou Bay, Kona. It was also added to the Register of Historic Places in 1978.

== Funding ==
As a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, the Daughters of Hawaii are supported by donations, dues, admission fees and fundraising events.

<text>Allard &amp; Co. was a British manufacturing company, established in 1889 in Coventry by Frederick W. Allard and George Pilkington as cycle makers.

In 1898 the company produced a 3-wheel motorised tricycle together with its first car. Car manufacturing started in 1899.

In 1901 the company merged with the Birmingham Motor Manufacturing and Supply Co and was renamed as Rex Motor Manufacturing Co.

==Vehicles==
Allard moved into the motor industry building a four-seater 4½ hp model based on the Benz, followed by a 3 hp air-cooled car with an engine said to be of their own manufacture.

In 1902 they offered a 9 hp single-cylinder light car. 

It is unknown how many if any have survived to present day .

<text>Harry Austin Tierney (May 21, 1890 – March 22, 1965) was an American composer of musical theatre, best known for long-running hits such as &quot;Irene&quot; (1919), Broadway&#x27;s longest-running show of the era (620 performances), &quot;Kid Boots&quot; (1923) and&quot; Rio Rita&quot; (1927), one of the first musicals to be turned into a talking picture (and later remade starring Abbott and Costello).

== Life and career ==
Born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, United States, he was most active between about 1910 and 1930, often collaborating with the lyricist Joseph McCarthy. His mother was a pianist, his father a trumpeter, and he himself toured as a concert pianist in his early years. After a brief spell working in London for a music publisher, he returned to the United States in 1916. Over the next couple of decades many of his songs were used in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, and were performed by the premier singers of the day, such as Eddie Cantor, Anna Held and Edith Day.

The year 1919 saw his greatest Broadway hit, the show &quot;Irene&quot;, which contained perhaps his most well-known song, &quot;Alice Blue Gown&quot;, as well as &quot;Castle of Dreams&quot;, an adaptation of Chopin&#x27;s Minute Waltz. This same show was made into a film in 1926, then remade in 1940 with Anna Neagle and Ray Milland, and again for the stage in 1973 with Debbie Reynolds. The original show broke the then record for the longest running show, at 620 performances.
Other shows followed with varying success, in particular, &quot;Rio Rita&quot; (collaborating with Joseph McCarthy, and one of RKO&#x27;s first forays in converting a musical to the silver screen), and &quot;Kid Boots&quot;, &quot;Dixiana&quot; (1929) and &quot;Half Shot at Sunrise&quot; (1930) were also made into films. Tierney&#x27;s successes after this period were sketchy (apart from the film remakes of &quot;Irene&quot;), but he was elected into the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

He died in March 1965, in New York, at the age of 74. Harry Tierney is interred at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.

<text>The All-British Car Company was a Scottish automobile manufacturer based at Bridgeton, Glasgow, from 1906 to 1908. The company was founded by George Johnston, formerly of Arrol-Johnston, primarily for the manufacture of a 54 horsepower eight-cylinder car with its cylinders arranged as two parallel fours. The pistons were actuated by two rocking beams which were driven by connecting rods from a normal four-throw crankshaft - a variation on the U engine. The unit was more complex than was necessary, and only a dozen All-British cars were ever completed.

<text>Desborough Hundred is a hundred in Buckinghamshire, England. It is situated in the south of the county and is bounded on the west by Oxfordshire and on the south the River Thames marked the boundary with Berkshire.

==History==
Until at least the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086 there were 18 hundreds in Buckinghamshire. It has been suggested however that neighbouring hundreds had already become more closely associated in the 11th century so that by the end of the 14th century the original or ancient hundreds had been consolidated into 8 larger hundreds. Desborough hundred is one of three hundreds which became collectively known as the Chiltern hundreds around the 13th century, the others being Burnham hundred and Stoke hundred. Even before this time these individual hundreds had become special possessions of the Crown and were together stewarded as a royal bailiwick, occupying the place of any dukedom, earldom or barony that might otherwise have had absolute possession of the whole area (see fee simple and knight&#x27;s fee). The Chiltern Hundreds were for all but this Crown Steward and Bailiff (one role), separately leased and administered, the lords of the various manors meeting occasionally in each hundred of the county, which were the main administrative units. Meanwhile the role of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds persisted in name only becoming a government-led appointment, and from 1751, a disqualifying sinecure for any elected members of the House of Commons.

==Parishes and hamlets ==
Desborough hundred comprised the following ancient parishes and hamlets (formerly medieval vills):

† Stokenchurch was originally in Oxfordshire, and transferred to Buckinghamshire in the latter part of the 19th century after the hundred was superseded.

‡ Later High Wycombe

<doc id="852862" wikidata="Q7439217" url="?curid=852862" title="Script breakdown">
<text>A script breakdown is an intermediate step in the production of a play, film, comic book, or any other work that is originally planned using a script.

==Film and television==
In film and television, a script breakdown is an analysis of a screenplay in which all of the production elements are reduced into lists. Within these lists are, in essence, the foundation of creating a production board, which is fundamental in creating a production schedule and production budget of an entire production of any film or television program in pre-production. This process is a very tedious and complex task, and is usually the responsibility of the Assistant Director or first or 1AD within the production staff of any given production company. However, many film directors and film producers have knowledge of breaking down a script.

In particular, literally breaking down the script is a very a thorough and detailed creative analysis of dramatic action in filmmaking, highlighting the reciprocal struggle, theme, and design elements of a screenplay. Which is to code the entire cast, extras, props, special effects, stunts, wranglers, picture cars, wardrobe, make-up and hair stylists, special equipment and or cameras, ADR,
Foley, film scores and soundtracks etc., which are all broken-down with different colored marker highlights within a shooting script.

After which, these highlights are then organized and broken-down into strips to organize the production schedule within the actual physical production board. This process is more easily done nowadays utilizing a computer than done manually, with features inside Final Draft called tagger, or utilizing tagging mode inside Movie Magic Screenwriter, another effective computer program. This information can easily be imported over to Movie Magic Scheduling to create a digital production board, and then easily imported over to Movie Magic Budgeting to create the entire production budget. Most of the script and production computer software out there comes in both Microsoft and MacOS versions, and even though there is competing software on the market, these which are listed are considered to be an entertainment industry standard. This whole process of the script breakdown however is not to be confused with character breakdowns utilized with casting calls, this is an entire different process with similar names, however administered by two entirely separate departments.

===Marking elements===
To ease future production, an assistant director marks the elements found in each scene. This process repeats for each new scene. By the end, the producer will be able to see which scenes need which elements, and can begin to schedule accordingly. The film industry has a standard for color-coding:

==Comics==
In comic books, it is the process of determining how each action, character, and piece of dialogue described in the script will be placed visually on a page. In the studio system that dominated mass-market comic-book production from the 1940s through the 1970s, breakdowns were done by the penciller or by a separate breakdown artist, rarely by the scriptwriter; in some cases, breakdowns were done from a rough story outline before the dialogue was written (the &quot;Marvel method&quot;). Later comics writers such as Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, influenced by cinematic technique, began to include more layout details within their scripts. Cartoonists who both write and draw their own work sometimes begin with a script and do their own breakdowns, and sometimes work through drawings without a separate script.

<text>The Magnetic Hill is a Canadian gravity hill, a type of optical illusion created by rising and descending terrain. It is located at the northwestern edge of the city of Moncton in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.

The general area is at the base of a ridge named &quot;Lutes Mountain&quot;, which rises several hundred feet above the surrounding Petitcodiac River valley.

==History==
With the rise in tourism after the Second World War, the roughly 1 kilometre segment of gravel road became one of Moncton&#x27;s prime tourist attractions (along with the tidal bore on the Petitcodiac River). Magnetic Hill is now an historic property.

<text>FanMail is the third studio album by American girl group TLC, released on February 23, 1999, by LaFace and Arista Records. The album title is a tribute to TLC&#x27;s fans who sent them fan mail during their hiatus. &quot;FanMail&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 318,000 copies in its first week of release, and spent five weeks at number one.

The album received eight nominations at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, including one for Album of the Year, winning three. It has been certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 10 million copies worldwide. &quot;FanMail&quot; is TLC&#x27;s second-best-selling album after their 1994 studio album &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;. To promote the album, TLC embarked on their first concert tour titled the FanMail Tour. It was the group&#x27;s final album released in Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes&#x27; lifetime before she died on April 25, 2002, as she was killed in a car crash prior to the release of their fourth studio album &quot;3D&quot; (2002).

==Background==
After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995, the group went on a recording hiatus. The suit was eventually settled on November 25, 1996. Preliminary work on their third studio album was delayed when friction arose between the group and their main producer Dallas Austin, who was at the time dating member Rozonda &quot;Chilli&quot; Thomas, and helped to raise their son Tron. Austin wanted $4.2 million and creative control on the project, resulting in a stand-off between him and the group. TLC eventually entered recording studios in April 1998 to start work on their then-untitled third album with Austin, who returned with a handshake agreement. While he contributed the most to the album and served as the executive producer, they also collaborated with long-term producers Babyface and L.A. Reid, as well as with Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. &quot;FanMail&quot; was initially scheduled for release on November 10, 1998, but was delayed to the first quarter of 1999.

Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes wrote and composed eight songs for the album, all of which Austin rejected, stating that they were &quot;inferior&quot;. Consequently, Lopes told MTV News in July 1998 that she decided to work on a solo album assisted by Erick Sermon. The album was planned to be released before &quot;FanMail&quot;, further causing tension among the group. During an interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; in 1999, Lopes publicly derided her involvement in TLC, remarking: &quot;I&#x27;ve graduated from this era. I cannot stand 100 percent behind this TLC project and the music that is supposed to represent me. This will be my last interview until I can speak freely about the truth and present myself on my solo project.&quot;

==Recording and production==
During the recording of &quot;FanMail&quot;, the group were offered many songs that would eventually be recorded by other artists such as 702&#x27;s &quot;Where My Girls At?&quot; (1999), Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (1998), and Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (1998). Thomas stated that the group considered recording each track but were worried that it did not represent them well. Tionne &quot;T-Boz&quot; Watkins reiterated Thomas&#x27; reasoning in an interview with MTV News, stating that &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; was not good for them despite appreciating and respecting Spears&#x27; decision to record it.

Watkins decided to begin writing poetry to deal with her emotions after being in and out of hospital due to sickle cell disease. She took her collection of poems to Austin, who helped her adapt one into the song &quot;Unpretty&quot;, while another was adapted by Babyface into &quot;Dear Lie&quot;. While writing and recording &quot;I&#x27;m Good at Being Bad&quot; in Minneapolis, Watkins had been inspired by grunge band Nirvana&#x27;s loud and soft dynamic shifts in their discography, and wanted to create a song in a similar style for TLC. Jam encouraged her to hum the melody while he played the beat in the recording booth, which was unlike her usual process of listening to the beat and writing out the lyrics. She stated that the technique influenced her as a songwriter. She sought to have Lopes rap the pre-chorus herself, but Lopes insisted that Watkins&#x27; thicker voice should be used for the track. Watkins also contributed to writing two more songs for the album, co-writing &quot;If They Knew&quot; and &quot;Shout&quot; with Austin and Lopes. Two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Come on Down&quot; and &quot;I Miss You So Much&quot;, were originally written for Watkins to sing lead. However, she decided that Thomas would be more suited as the lead vocalist after attempting to record them. During the recording of the latter, Thomas was suffering from a sinus infection. She asked to re-record the song the next week despite it being near the album&#x27;s deadline, but Babyface decided that the vocal take she had recorded would be suitable for the final version. &quot;No Scrubs&quot; was one of the final tracks recorded for the album. It was originally written by Kandi Burruss, Tameka Cottle, and Briggs for the former two artists to record together as part of the girl group Xscape. However, Austin persuaded Briggs to give the song to TLC as their first single for &quot;FanMail&quot;, with Thomas singing the lead vocals. Austin further emphasized that it was a breakthrough for her, as he believed that she was more capable than being relegated to a secondary vocalist.

==Composition==
&quot;FanMail&quot; took on a new, futuristic style, due to the rapid advancement in technology heading into the new millennium such as the Y2K bug and Napster. This was effectively portrayed in the album&#x27;s most popular song &quot;No Scrubs&quot; along with the music video, which embraces a modern emphasis on female strength and independence. The album contains several tracks featuring vocals by the computer modulated voice Vic-E, a talking android which is reminiscent of the &quot;tour guide&quot; on A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s 1993 studio album, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;. Initially, the android was created through the Macintosh&#x27;s greeting voice as a replacement for Lopes, as she refused to work with the group. However, once she reconciled with them, she approved of the android and decided to include it on the album as a character.

&quot;FanMail&quot; is an R&amp;B album, that includes tracks featuring funk, hip hop-inspired dance-pop, and ballads. Several producers were involved in the album&#x27;s production, including Dallas Austin, Babyface, Jermaine Dupri, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis. Throughout 17 tracks, TLC brought up issues of sexuality, insecurities, self-reliance, and vulnerability with resistant messaging. It fused elements of &quot;new jill swing&quot; and sounds created from a Roland TR-808, to form a &quot;cyber-R&amp;B masterpiece&quot;. On the first track &quot;FanMail&quot;, Austin used multiple samples from the internet and movies in order to create a &quot;space sound&quot; that &quot;will sound like what the album cover looks like&quot;. The background noise consisting of typewriters and printers was incorporated to represent the fan letters and fan mail, while Austin added a sample from an interview with Lopes commenting &quot;all these conflicting fan mail&quot;, and created a hook with it. The song consisted of a sneaking bassline, vocal stutters, and glitches similar to that of dial-up Internet. However, in contrast to the album&#x27;s dominating technological sound, &quot;Unpretty&quot; is an alternative pop song that describes the insecurity caused by body-shaming. The song was inspired by a poem written by Watkins. &quot;Communicate (Interlude)&quot; establishes the connection between the thoughts and feelings of people nearby through technology. The lyrics from the song, &quot;There&#x27;s over a thousand ways/ To communicate in our world today/ And it&#x27;s a shame/ That we don&#x27;t connect&quot; describe the lack of interaction between humans, which in turn has increased the rate of depression among adolescents. It combines the typing of a keyboard in the background with Left Eye&#x27;s vocals, &quot;will you communicate with me?&quot;.

==Artwork, packaging, and title==
The &quot;FanMail&quot; cover featured a custom font design, and cover art with decode-able binary code which included images of the TLC members in metallic skin tones. The photographer, Dan Levy, shot the silver-painted group members without any digital alterations. Writing for &quot;i-D&quot;, Annie Lord described the members on the cover as &quot;three digitised, disembodied cyborgs from another dimension&quot;, and compared the binary code across their faces to &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The CD insert folds out to form a large poster featuring a picture of the three TLC members and the names of thousands of people who sent them fan mail throughout their career. A limited edition of the album was released, which had an insert with a lenticular version of the cover placed in front of the original booklet in the jewel case.

The album title is a tribute to TLC&#x27;s fans after their five-year hiatus. It came from Lopes, who also coined the group&#x27;s first two album titles &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot; and &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, and initially wanted to name the album &quot;Fan2See&quot;. She stated to the group, &quot;let&#x27;s write and sing one big fan letter. Let&#x27;s put fan names on everything – all the singles, the album cover, T-shirts, mugs. Just show our appreciation&quot;.

==Promotion==
===Singles===
&quot;FanMail&quot;, &quot;Silly Ho&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Good at Being Bad&quot;, and &quot;My Life&quot; served as promotional singles for the album. Those songs charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.

&quot;No Scrubs&quot; was the official lead single and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four consecutive weeks, becoming TLC&#x27;s biggest commercial success in years. It also ranked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Year-End Hot 100 of 1999.

Follow-up single &quot;Unpretty&quot; also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, spending three weeks at number one and placing at number 20 on the Year-End Hot 100.

Originally, &quot;Shout&quot; was planned to be a single in the United States, while &quot;Dear Lie&quot; would be a single internationally, but only the latter would end up being released as a single with an accompanying music video. It peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===Tour===

TLC embarked on the FanMail Tour to promote the album. It was their first headlining tour, and their first tour in five years. As part of a sponsorship with MP3.com, the group released &quot;I Need That&quot;, with proceeds sent to the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. The song was described by the producer Rico Lumpkins as &quot;more R&amp;B than hip-hop&quot;. The stage and costumes were all designed by each TLC member. The FanMail Tour became the highest-grossing tour by a girl group, as it grossed over $72.8 million. It was the final tour with all three members together.

==Critical reception==
Writing for &quot;Muzik&quot;, Tony Farsides stated that &quot;FanMail&quot; was &quot;a real grower&quot; in comparison to other albums released during the time. &quot;NME&quot; writer Roger Morton compared the album&#x27;s &quot;cyber concept&quot; to Prince&#x27;s electronic funk discography and opined that TLC were not diminished by other girl groups such as Honeyz, All Saints, and the Spice Girls.

Ann Powers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that elements of &quot;FanMail&quot; were &quot;fragmented&quot; despite sounding more &quot;sharper [and] aggressive&quot; than &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, but praised the TLC members for taking &quot;brave&quot; risks. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the group were attempting to imitate the production of &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; although he noted the album&#x27;s versatility. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; staff writer Marc Weingarten negatively stated that the vocals were &quot;wispy [and] flat&quot;, and that all members were &quot;severely limited singers&quot;. However, he commented that the album&#x27;s production managed to overpower their vocals with &quot;sinewy beats and startling arrangements&quot;.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized TLC&#x27;s &quot;startlingly faceless and homogeneous&quot; vocals and opined that &quot;FanMail&quot; was an &quot;endless parade of hooks&quot; without the essence of R&amp;B. He acknowledged that their vocals were typical of some R&amp;B artists in the 1990s who &quot;warble in the same half-asleep murmur&quot; and lamented that the genre is &quot;curiously dispassionate&quot;. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Joshua Clover stated that the album was &quot;a burning, physical message that looks like a spectacle but reads like sexual politics&quot; and criticized the producers for attempting to resemble Timbaland&#x27;s production.

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;FanMail&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with 318,000 copies sold in its first week, becoming TLC&#x27;s first number-one album on both charts. On June 21, 2000, it was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 4.8 million copies in the United States as of July 2017; it had sold an additional 877,000 copies through the BMG Music Club as of February 2003. Internationally, the album reached the top 10 in New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. As of February 2019, &quot;FanMail&quot; has sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

<text>James Edwin Otto (January 5, 1938 – May 19, 2024) was an American professional football player who was a center for 15 seasons with the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes.

Otto was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980, his first year of eligibility. He was also named to the AFL All-Time Team and NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

He had over 70 football-related surgeries, including a leg amputation.

==Early life and college==
Otto was born on January 5, 1938, in Wausau, Wisconsin. His parents Lorenz and Loretta (Totsch) Otto worked a variety of jobs to help the family get by, and they had so little when Otto was a boy, they could not afford new shoes to keep his feet warm and dry in Wisconsin&#x27;s winters. Growing up as a child, he wanted to be a football player like Elroy &quot;Crazylegs&quot; Hirsch. He recalled Hirsch once saying, &quot;‘if you put your heart into it, you can do it.’”

Otto played football at Wausau High School at linebacker and center for the Lumberjacks, under coach Win Brockmeyer; who also coached Otto&#x27;s hero, Crazylegs Hirsch, at Wausau. Otto, the team co-captain, and the Lumberjacks were 18-5-2 during his high school football career. He was particularly inspired by his offensive line coach, Tom Yelich. At a 1980 banquet honoring Otto in Wausau, Otto credited Yelich with teaching the technique Otto then used throughout college and professional football. “&#x27;Yelich was the first coach I ever had, and he helped me more than any coach since.&#x27;” 

Otto had offers from 48 colleges to play college football, and with the help of Brockmeyer, chose the University of Miami in south Florida, where he joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. In addition to playing offensive center at the University of Miami, he also played linebacker on defense.

Otto was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1972.

==Professional career==
No National Football League team showed interest in the undersized center, who weighed only 205 pounds. Otto was drafted by the proposed Minneapolis franchise of the new American Football League in the 25th round of the first AFL draft, before play ever began in the new league. When the Minneapolis contingent reneged on joining the AFL, to accept instead an NFL expansion franchise, the AFL replaced the Minnesota franchise with a team in Oakland, which inherited Minnesota&#x27;s draft picks. Otto&#x27;s rights then defaulted to the AFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders. He then signed with the Raiders and played for the entire 10 years of the league&#x27;s existence and five years beyond that after the merger of the NFL and AFL. In his rookie year at training camp, he weighed 217 pounds, but was up to 240 pounds by the end of his first year.

Otto worked diligently to build his body up to his playing weight of . Otto wore the jersey number of 50 in his rookie season, but the suggestion of equipment manager Frank Hinek led to the idea of Otto wearing 00 (0 was being worn in the NFL by Johnny Olszewski) &quot;for recognition&quot;, which Otto eventually went with, as did AFL Commissioner Joe Foss. 

For the next 15 years, Otto was a fixture at center for the Raiders, never missing a single game due to injury, and played in 210 consecutive games. He won one AFL/AFC championship in 1967 against the Houston Oilers with the Raiders, but lost five: in 1968, 1969, 1970, 1973, and 1974 to the New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Colts, Miami Dolphins, and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively, with all five teams winning the Super Bowl. 

He played alongside Gene Upshaw, another Hall of Famer, at left guard from 1967 to 1974. In the 1967 regular season, Oakland scored 468 points (33.4 points/game), leading the AFL, but lost Super Bowl II to the Green Bay Packers. In 1968, Oakland scored 453 points (32.4 points/game) in the regular season, again leading the AFL, and beat the Chiefs in the divisional round (unscheduled tiebreaker) before losing to the Jets. In the 1969 regular season, Oakland scored 377 points (26.9 points/game) to lead the AFL for the third consecutive year, and beat the Houston Oilers in the new divisional round of the AFL playoffs before losing to the Chiefs. In the 1970 regular season, the first year of the NFL-AFL merger, Oakland scored 300 points (21.4 points/game), ranking ninth in the 26-team NFL, and beat the Miami Dolphins in the AFC playoffs before losing to the Colts. The Raiders missed the playoffs for the first time in five years in 1971, despite scoring 344 points (24.6 points/game), second highest in the NFL.

The Raiders came back stronger in 1972, scoring 365 points (26.1 points/game), ranking third in the NFL, but lost 13–7 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, the famous Immaculate Reception game, in which Otto also made the only pass reception of his professional career. In the 1973 regular season, Oakland scored 292 points (20.9 points/game), tenth in the NFL, and avenged their defeat to the Steelers, but lost to the Dolphins. In Otto&#x27;s final year, 1974, Oakland scored 355 points (25.4 points/game), leading the NFL, and avenged their playoff loss to the Dolphins, but lost to the Steelers again. In 1975, he was replaced by Dave Dalby, in his fourth season out of UCLA. Otto was the last member of the Oakland Raiders inaugural team from 1960 to retire.

Otto was one of the original Oakland Raiders, and played during the team&#x27;s full tenure in the AFL, from 1960 to 1969. He continued as a Raider in the NFL from 1970 to 1974, starting 210 consecutive games, playing a total of 308 games for the Raiders. He was one of only 20 players to play for the entire ten-year existence of the American Football League, and one of only three players to play in all of his team&#x27;s AFL games (along with teammate George Blanda and Gino Cappelletti). Otto was also selected as &quot;The Sporting News&quot; All-League center from 1960 through 1969. He was an All-Star in the first 13 of his 15 seasons – every year in the AFL from 1960 through 1969 and three of his five seasons in the NFL, being All NFL in 1970 and 1971 and second team All NFL in 1972. He played in 12 All Star games and was All League 12 consecutive years. He was also named the starting center on the AFL All-Time Team. He is one of only three players (along with hall of famers Johnny Robinson and Ron Mix), who were on the All-AFL first team and the combined AFL/NFL all-decade team for the 1960s.

During his career, the Raiders won seven divisional championships from 1967 through 1974, and were AFL champions in 1967, meeting the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. Otto&#x27;s offensive linemates with the Raiders included hall of famers Gene Upshaw, Art Shell, and Bob Brown. Hall of fame and NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team coach Bill Walsh, who was an offensive assistant coach with the 1966 Raiders said of Otto, &quot;&#x27;He had techniques others tried to emulate but couldn’t. ... I used to marvel at his skills. He played every down with intensity.&#x27;” Rival Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Bobby Bell, a hall of famer, 100th Anniversary All-Time teammate, and himself a member of the AFL&#x27;s All-Time Team, said Otto was the best center he ever played against.

Otto was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 78 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. In 2019, he was revealed as being selected to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, being one of only four centers named. In 2021, he was the 97th greatest player of all time listed by &quot;The Athletic&quot;.

==Injuries and operations==
Otto&#x27;s body was punished greatly during his NFL career, resulting in nearly 74 operations, including 28 on his knee (nine of them during his playing career) and multiple joint replacements. His joints became riddled with arthritis and he developed debilitating back and neck problems. In his book, &quot;The Pain of Glory&quot;, Otto described near-death experiences from medical procedures, including fighting off three life-threatening infections due to complications from his artificial joints. During one six-month stretch, he was without a right knee joint because he had to wait for an infection to heal before another artificial knee could be implanted. Otto eventually had to have his right leg amputated on August 1, 2007. Despite his maladies, Otto said he had no regrets and would not have changed a thing even if given the opportunity to do it over again. He discussed his sports injuries as well as the concussions issue in a 2013 &quot;Frontline&quot; interview for &quot;League of Denial: The NFL&#x27;s Concussion Crisis&quot; and the 1985 documentary &quot;Disposable Heroes: The Other Side of Football&quot;, directed by Bill Couturié.

==Personal life==
After his career, Otto worked for the Raiders during two periods, and then made a &quot;small fortune&quot; from Burger King franchises, liquor stores, a walnut orchard, and real estate in the Oakland area.

Otto was also the subject of &quot;The Jim Otto Suite&quot;, a series of three multimedia works by American contemporary artist Matthew Barney, which served as a precursor to &quot;The Cremaster Cycle&quot;.

Otto was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. He was the grandfather of dog musher Amanda Otto.

Otto died on May 19, 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>Leslie Stuart (15 March 1863 – 27 March 1928) born Thomas Augustine Barrett was an English composer of Edwardian musical comedy, best known for the hit show &quot;Florodora&quot; (1899) and many popular songs.

He began in Manchester as a church organist, for 14 years, and taught music while beginning to compose church music and secular songs in the late 1870s. In the 1880s, he began to promote and conduct orchestral and vocal concerts of popular and theatre music as &quot;Mr. T. A. Barrett&#x27;s Concerts&quot;. He began to focus his composition on music hall, including songs for blackface performers, such as &quot;Lily of Laguna&quot;; songs for musical theatre, such as pantomimes and London shows touring through Manchester; and ballads such as &quot;Soldiers of the King&quot;. Stuart later campaigned against the interpolation of new songs into musical theatre scores and for better enforcement of musical copyrights.

In 1895, Stuart began to write songs for George Edwardes&#x27;s London shows at the Gaiety Theatre and Daly&#x27;s Theatre. His first full musical comedy score was &quot;Florodora&quot; in 1899. The show became an international hit, and its song &quot;Tell me, pretty maiden&quot;, became a vaudeville standard. Other musical comedy successes followed, including &quot;The School Girl&quot; (1903), &quot;The Belle of Mayfair&quot; (1906) and &quot;Havana&quot; (1908). Of his later shows, only &quot;Peggy&quot; made much of an impact. By 1911, Stuart&#x27;s gambling debts sent him into bankruptcy. Unable to adapt to changing musical tastes, he was no longer in demand as a composer, although he had some success as a piano sketch artist in variety theatre.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Stuart was born in Southport, on the Lancashire coast. He was the younger son of Thomas Barrett, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Mary Ann Burke, &quot;née&quot; Lester, who were both from western Ireland. He grew up in Liverpool, where he attended St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College. His family moved to Manchester in 1873.
Stuart began his career aged 15 as organist at Salford Cathedral. He held the post for seven years, and then moved to be organist at the Church of the Holy Name, Manchester, where he remained for another seven years. To augment his salary he composed church music and taught.

Stuart also promoted and conducted orchestral and vocal concerts. In the 1880s and 1890s he presented &quot;Mr T. A. Barrett&#x27;s Concerts&quot; at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and later at the larger St James&#x27;s Hall. These concerts featured popular orchestral music and selections from comic operas by such composers as Sullivan and Cellier, and excerpts from English grand operas by Balfe and Wallace. Singers included Zélie de Lussan, Marie Roze, Ben Davies, David Ffrangcon-Davies, Durward Lely and Charles Manners. Instrumental soloists included Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Eugène Ysaÿe.

Thomas Barrett had been property master at the Amphitheatre, Liverpool, and both his sons had quickly gained a taste for the theatre. Stuart&#x27;s elder brother, Stephen (1855–1924), became a music-hall performer, appearing under the stage name Lester Barrett. Gradually the music Stuart composed for local shows, and his popular ballads and music-hall songs began to supersede the composition of serious and religious music. He composed music hall songs as &quot;T. A. Barrett&quot; and under the pseudonyms &quot;Leslie Thomas&quot;, &quot;Lester Barrett&quot; and, most notably, &quot;Leslie Stuart&quot;. He wrote many popular songs for the blackface performer Eugene Stratton, including perhaps his best-remembered music hall song, &quot;Lily of Laguna&quot; (1898), and &quot;Little Dolly Daydream.&quot; He also wrote the patriotic ballad &quot;Soldiers of the King&quot; (1894, now sung as &quot;Soldiers of the Queen&quot;). In 1886, Stuart married Mary Catherine Fox, a schoolteacher (died 1941).
Stuart&#x27;s earliest theatrical composing and writing was also for the Manchester theatre. Here he provided songs and incidental music for, in particular, the local pantomimes, which boasted famous names in their casts. Stuart made a name in the 1890s by writing popular individual numbers that were interpolated into several West End and touring musicals by other composers. Later in his career, he would actively oppose this practice. The first of these songs was &quot;Lousiana Lou&quot;. This had already been published and performed in music hall before being picked up by Ellaline Terriss and inserted, along with &quot;The Little Mademoiselle&quot;, into the original production of &quot;The Shop Girl&quot; (1894), at the Gaiety Theatre.

During the run of George Edwardes&#x27;s &quot;An Artist&#x27;s Model&quot; (1895), Stuart wrote several numbers that were interpolated (including &quot;The Soldiers of the Queen&quot;, which was later famous as &quot;Soldiers of the King&quot;), and both wrote the lyric and composed &quot;Trilby Will Be True&quot; for Maurice Farkoa to perform at Daly&#x27;s Theatre. Subsequently he had songs used in &quot;Baron Golosh&quot;, &quot;The Circus Girl&quot; (1896), the London production of the American musical &quot;A Day in Paris&quot; (1897), Carl Kiefert&#x27;s &quot;The Ballet Girl&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Yashmak&quot; (1897).

Stuart composed some 65 songs including, in addition to those mentioned above, &quot;The Bandolero&quot;, and &quot;Little Dolly Daydream.&quot; His instrumental pieces included at least one Cakewalk. As a songwriter, Stuart suffered so much from the effects of copyright infringement that it can be speculated that his move to the musical theatre was an attempt to avoid the loss of royalty income from the publication of sheet music and performances.

===Peak years===
Stuart&#x27;s greatest acclaim came in 1899 with &quot;Florodora&quot;, his first full musical comedy score, with a book by Owen Hall. With traditional slow love ballads as well as waltzes and more rhythmic and playful concerted numbers, the score and show became a worldwide hit. The double sextet from that show, &quot;Tell me, pretty maiden&quot;, became a vaudeville standard. The music critic Neville Cardus wrote about the &quot;beautiful and unexpected phrasing and transitions&quot; in the number, continuing, &quot;it begins with a long phrase, rather like the opening bars of a Brahms symphony. It is extraordinary to find music such as this in a musical comedy&quot;. He ended by writing that in its own way it was &quot;just as perfect a composition … as is the quintet in &quot;Meistersinger&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Florodora&quot; was followed by &quot;The Silver Slipper&quot; (1901), &quot;The School Girl&quot; (1903), &quot;The Belle of Mayfair&quot; (1906), and &quot;Havana&quot; (1908). All these shows were successful and were produced internationally.

Stuart was an active campaigner for intellectual property rights and called for tighter laws on both national and international copyright. Publishers and wealthy second-rate songwriters would pay producers, for the exposure, to insert their songs into a hit musical. With the strength of the fame of &quot;Florodora&quot; behind him, Stuart succeeded in stopping this practice in his next few pieces. Similarly, he had succeeded from time to time in parts of his fight in Britain and in America against unauthorized music distribution and on behalf of firmer national and international copyright laws.
The success of Stuart&#x27;s shows led George Edwardes to hope that he would be able to replace the Caryll and Monckton writing partnership on their departure from the Gaiety Theatre. Stuart&#x27;s next show, &quot;Captain Kidd&quot; (1909), however, was not for the Gaiety, and it was a flop. &quot;The Observer&quot; praised the performances of Terriss, Seymour Hicks and Ivy St Helier, but said that Stuart&#x27;s music &quot;had one striking and ingenious melody ... and two or three pretty tunes, and was adequate throughout without being remarkable.&quot; His next production, &quot;The Slim Princess&quot; (1910), made only a modest impact, though it was produced in New York as well as in London. &quot;Peggy&quot; was produced at the Gaiety in 1911 and had a reasonable but not outstanding run, from March to November in London, as well as a Broadway run. In the words of Stuart&#x27;s biographer Andrew Lamb, these pieces &quot;failed to add to his reputation&quot;.

===Later years===
By 1911, the lack of any new stage successes, coupled with gambling debts and the interest due on them, resulted in Stuart&#x27;s appearance before the bankruptcy courts. He was declared bankrupt in 1913 and not discharged until 1920. At the age of 48 he found that changing tastes in musical styles and the influence of modern dance rhythms meant his career as a composer was effectively over, although he did write a number of songs that were inserted, against his principles, in the shows of other composers and a musical, &quot;Bubbles&quot; (1914), that was produced only in the provinces on a small scale.

Stuart retained an income, provided by continued revivals and performances of the popular &quot;Florodora&quot;, and supplemented this by appearing with success in variety theatre, where he performed his most famous songs accompanying himself on the piano. However, after the bankruptcy, he began to drink and have marital problems. Stuart&#x27;s last years were spent partly in trying to achieve production of his musical play &quot;Nina&quot;, also known as &quot;The Girl from Nyusa&quot;. The Shubert brothers took out an option to produce the work, but nothing materialised. In 1927, shortly before his death, Stuart wrote a series of fourteen short pieces for the &quot;Empire News&quot;, consisting of recollections and reminiscences. They were collected and republished in 2003 under the title &quot;My Bohemian Life&quot;. Stuart and his wife, Kitty, had five children who survived to adulthood, Mary &quot;May&quot; (1886–1956), Thomas &quot;Leslie&quot; (1888–1970), Marie &quot;Dollie&quot; (1891–1949), Stephen &quot;Chap&quot; (b. 1894) and Constance &quot;Lola&quot; (b. 1896).

Stuart died at his daughter May&#x27;s home in Richmond, Surrey, in 1928, at the age of 65, and was buried in Richmond Cemetery.

==Reputation and legacy==
The mid-20th century critic James Agate said that he had proved the quality of Stuart&#x27;s music: he took a Stuart song, halved the tempo, supplied German words – and serious musicians accepted without demur his assertion that it was a recently discovered cradle song by Brahms. In 2003 the critic Rodney Milnes called Stuart &quot;the most gifted composer of musical comedy in Britain between Sullivan and Vivian Ellis&quot;.

A 1941 biographical film entitled &quot;You Will Remember&quot; about Stuart starred Robert Morley as Stuart. It features several of Stuart&#x27;s songs. Stuart&#x27;s songs have been used in over a dozen other films. A bronzed plaster plaque of Stuart, made by John Cassidy, was placed in the Manchester Central Library in April 1939, inscribed &quot;A son of Manchester who moved the nation to song&quot;.

<text>The Institute of Actuaries was one of the two professional bodies which represented actuaries in the United Kingdom. The institute was based in England, while the other body, the Faculty of Actuaries, was based in Scotland. While the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries were separate institutions, they worked very closely together, and their professional qualifications and actuarial standards were identical. On 25 May 2010, voting members of the institute who took part in a ballot voted to merge the institute with the faculty, thus creating the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, which came into being on 1 August 2010. The Institute of Actuaries ceased to exist on that date.

==Establishment of the Institute of Actuaries==
The actuaries of a number of life assurance companies established the Institute of Actuaries in London on the 8th of July 1848. The Institute of Actuaries was the oldest actuarial professional body in the world.

In July 1884, the Institute of Actuaries was granted a royal charter. The royal charter confirmed the institute&#x27;s role and the right to confer qualifications, i.e. the Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries (FIA). Since then there has been an underpinning concept of professional behaviour and the implicit right, or even duty, to discipline members who did not conduct themselves appropriately.

==Examinations==
An actuarial qualification from the Institute of Actuaries consisted of a combination of the completion of various examinations and courses. The examinations were split into four sections: Core Technical (CT), Core Applications (CA), Specialist Technical (ST), and Specialist Applications (SA). Study material for the examinations is usually obtained through the official bookshop of the Institute of Actuaries or through The Actuarial Education Company (ActEd), a subsidiary of BPP Actuarial Education Ltd.

In addition to examinations and courses, it was required that the candidate both complete at least three years work as an actuary and be at least 23 years of age, for one to qualify as a “Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries” (FIA) 

===Core Examinations===
The Core Technical section consisted of the 8 exams and a “Business Awareness Module,” CT9. These were usually first sat by a candidate and included the underlying mathematics involved in actuarial work as well as an introduction to financial and economic issues. These were also the most common exams for which candidates may get exemptions. While these were the first exams, candidates coming from a less mathematical background often find these more difficult than the later ones due to the mathematical theory content. Topics covered include annuities, stochastic modelling, time series, and economics.

The Core Applications section consisted of two exams and a modeling course, CA2, that focus on the application of concepts learned, especially to insurance companies. This included the communications model, CA3, which tested the candidate on their ability to communicate complex actuarial concepts to others.

===Specialist Examinations===
The Specialist Technical section represented the first time the candidate had a choice of which exams to take. The candidate chose two from the various actuarial specialist subjects i.e. Health and Care, Life Insurance, General Insurance, Pensions, Finance or Investments and further technical knowledge on said subjects is attained.

The Specialist Applications section allowed the candidate to choose one area for which they take the SA paper and attain full Fellowship; leading to many referring to this as the “Fellowship paper.” However, as the rules on the ordering of examinations were relaxed, this examination may be taken before taking some earlier examinations resulting in candidates qualifying on other papers.

==List of Examinations==

==University-based examinations==
A student may choose to complete an accredited actuarial science degree at an undergraduate or at a postgraduate level through a number of recognised universities. Successful students may offer proof of having covered the topics whilst at university and students may be granted exemptions from certain professional examinations from the Institute of Actuaries.

Depending on the university, a different number of courses may be recognised for exemption. The examinations and the exemption pass level for the examinations is usually externalised by members of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

Naturally, the quality of the courses and lecturing at these universities are a determinant as to whether the course is recognised by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

Most universities offering actuarial science courses also require the student in addition to complete various other related topics, including statistics, mathematics, applied mathematics, economics and accounting for recognition of an actuarial degree.

Upon completion of the university degree, students would then complete all remaining examinations through the Institute of Actuaries to qualify as an actuary and become a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries (FIA).

==Membership Categories==
In total there were approximately 15700 members of the Institute of Actuaries falling into the following categories. 
* Affiliates were non-actuary members of the Institute of Actuaries who are kept up-to-date with the developments within the Actuarial Profession through publications and affiliates are able to participate in meetings, research and conferences;
* Student actuaries were members of the institute who are taking exams but have not attained the rank of Associate;
* Associates were members who had completed the CT and CA stages of exams and have completed one year&#x27;s worth of relevant work-based skills experience. There were about 500 Associates in the institute. They bear the letters AIA after their names;
* Fellows were &quot;fully qualified&quot; members of the institute who had met the training demands by both completing all the examinations and meeting the work experience requirements. Fellows and Associates have the right to describe themselves as an actuary. There were about 9500 Fellows in the institute. They bear the letters FIA after their names;
* Honorary Fellows were voted on by the Council if it feels are appears to be able to render assistance in promoting the objects of the institute and who is not professionally engaged in practice as an actuary.

==Criticism==
Following the near collapse of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the government commissioned Derek Morris, the former head of the Competition Commission, to look into the failings of the actuarial profession and make recommendations for reform (2005). His report highlighted concerns about the process by which the profession had sought to keep its syllabus and teaching materials up to date, about the way that ‘entrenched commercial interests’ had hindered the development of the institute&#x27;s education policy, referring to &#x27;an insularity that constrained the extent and effectiveness of input from academics, other professions and those in wider fields of practice&#x27;.

The Review proposed a regime of independent oversight of the institute&#x27;s regulation of the profession by the Financial Reporting Council.

<doc id="852877" wikidata="Q1129941" url="?curid=852877" title="Alldays &amp; Onions">
<text>Alldays &amp; Onions was an English engineering business and an early automobile manufacturer based at Great Western Works and Matchless Works, Small Heath, Birmingham. It manufactured cars from 1898 to 1918. The cars were sold under the Alldays &amp; Onions name. Alldays also built an early British built tractor, the &quot;Alldays General Purpose Tractor&quot;. After the First World War the cars were sold under the name Enfield Alldays. Car production seems to have ceased in the 1920s but the manufacture of many other items continued. The company became part of the Mitchell Cotts Group.

==History==

Engineering businesses: Onions (formed by John Onions in 1650) and William Allday &amp; Co. (formed by William Allday in 1720) joined in 1889 under the ownership of Alldays &amp; Onions Pneumatic Engineering Company Limited. They made engineering and blacksmithing equipment. Like many such companies at the time they turned to bicycle manufacture and sold a range under the Alldays name. They also started making motorcycles in 1903 under the Alldays-Matchless name; these had no connection with the London-based Matchless company, and in 1915 presumably following representations from them, the name was changed to Allon. Manufacture of these continued until 1927.

Alldays and Onions produced its first car in 1898. The Traveller, a quadricycle made in private and commercial forms, was steered by a wheel. It had an unsprung rear end, power generated by a 4 hp De Dion single-cylinder motor. However, series production did not start until 1903/4 with the 7 hp model. Larger commercial vehicles of up to 5 tons were also made in the years preceding the first World War and saw service during the conflict.

Alldays hit commercial success with the 1.6-litre, vertical-twin side-valve 10/12, which was made from 1905 to 1913. It was popular with commercial drivers and did well in period formula events and hill-climbs. A 16 hp 4-cylinder joined the lineup in 1906, and in 1908, the Enfield Autocar Co. was acquired. Shortly afterward, the range was rationalized, with most models being sold under both brand-names. The Alldays contribution to the equation was the well-established twin- and four-cylinders that put out 14 and 20 hp, always shaft-driven. A 30/35 hp six-cylinder was listed from 1911 to 1914, compressed-air starters being optional in 1911. In 1913, the 990 cc V-twin Midget cyclecar was introduced, featuring air cooling and shaft drive, selling at £138.10s. (About £ today). An 1100 cc 4-cylinder version with a bullnose radiator appeared in 1914, popular at the price of £175. (About £ today). Pair-cast side-valve four-cylinders rated at 12/14, 16/20, and 25/30 hp filled out the immediate pre-war offerings. 

Alldays &amp; Onions had merged in 1908 with the short lived Enfield Autocar Company which had been formed to take over the car making interests of the Enfield Cycle Company. They produced cars called Enfield-Allday until 1925.

Alldays and Onions also manufactured railway inspection cars for the Great Eastern and London, Brighton and South Coast Railways. At least one of these found its way to Australia for use on the Wolgan Valley Railway. Another was built in 1906 for the extensive three foot gauge system of the County Donegal Railways in Ireland. It later went into passenger service and became their Railcar Number 1. Although small, its success led to larger vehicles being built and contributed to the introduction of internal combustion railcars and multiple units across Ireland. It is preserved at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.

==Product range==
On flotation as a public company in 1916 the following products were manufactured: motor lorries, cars and vans, cycles and motor cycles, complete outfits for foundries, engineers&#x27; and railway workshops, pneumatic power hammers, drop and lifting stamps, oil, gas and fuel furnaces, hardening shop equipment, Roots blowers, blacksmiths&#x27; shops, exhaust and blowing fans, smiths&#x27; hearths, portable forges, anvils and vises, cranes, pulley blocks, bellows, etc.

== Main Car Models==
==Tractor Models==

* The &quot;Alldays General Purpose Tractor&quot; - only a couple of examples survive in the UK of this early internal-combustion-engined model. The tractor had advanced features such as sprung axles, enclosed engine and a basic canopy for the operator.

<text>Stephen Flaherty (born September 18, 1960) is an American composer of musical theatre and film. He works most often in collaboration with the lyricist/book writer Lynn Ahrens. They are best known for writing the Broadway musicals &quot;Ragtime&quot;, which was nominated for thirteen Tony Awards, two Grammy Awards, and won the Tony for Best Original Score; &quot;Once on This Island&quot;, which won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, the Olivier Award for London&#x27;s Best Musical, and was nominated for a Grammy Award and eight Tony Awards; and &quot;Seussical&quot;, which was nominated for the Grammy Award. Flaherty was also nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards (with Lynn Ahrens) for his songs and song score for the animated film musical &quot;Anastasia&quot;.

==Biography==
Flaherty was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He began studying piano at the age of seven. When he was twelve, he knew he wanted to write musicals and by age fourteen he had already composed his first musical score. He attended South Hills Catholic High School in Pittsburgh and later studied musical composition and piano at University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, graduating in 1982. with a B.M. in Musical Composition. He did additional graduate studies in Musical Theater at New York University.

===Career===
As a college student, Flaherty played ragtime piano in a dance band. This early job would serve Flaherty well later in life when he had the opportunity to compose the score for the Broadway musical &quot;Ragtime&quot;.

He moved to New York City in 1982 and joined the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop, founded by music director Lehman Engel, where he met Lynn Ahrens, who was to become his longtime collaborator. He also studied Musical Theater in the graduate program at New York University during this time, where his teachers included Richard Maltby, Jr. and Arthur Laurents, among others. The first Ahrens and Flaherty collaboration that was produced was a one-act children&#x27;s show, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, for TheatreWorks USA in 1985. Their next produced musical was &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot;, produced Off-Broadway in 1988 at Playwrights Horizons.

Their first Broadway musical was &quot;Once on This Island,&quot; in 1990, which transferred from Off-Broadway&#x27;s Playwrights Horizons. The musical was nominated for 8 Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Book and Best Score. The London production of the show won the Olivier Award (London&#x27;s Tony) for Best Musical in 1995. The show was later revived on Broadway in an immersive production at Circle in the Square in December 2017, where it was again nominated for 8 Tony Awards, winning for Best Revival of a Musical. The cast recording of the revival was nominated for the Grammy in 2019. It was Flaherty&#x27;s first Grammy nomination as a producer.

In 1992, Flaherty and Ahrens were signed by Disney to write the animated musical &quot;Song of the Sea&quot;, a coming of age story about a humpback whale. Though the film was never produced, several key development executives on the project would play a part in Flaherty and Ahrens&#x27; later film musical, &quot;Anastasia&quot;.

Also in 1992, Flaherty and Ahrens wrote the musical &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, based on the film of the same title, with a book by Joseph Dougherty. It was notably the first original American musical to be produced by Lincoln Center Theatre. Flaherty would eventually go on to write three additional original musicals for Lincoln Center Theatre, all in collaboration with Ms. Ahrens: &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; (2002, with a book by Terrence McNally), &quot;Dessa Rose&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Glorious Ones&quot; (2007). He was nominated for Outstanding Music by the Drama Desk Awards on all three of these shows.

The critically acclaimed &quot;Ragtime&quot; (also with a book by Terrence McNally) had its world premiere in Toronto in December 1996, its American premiere in Los Angeles in June 1997, and its Broadway premiere in January 1998, where it ran for two years. It won four Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Score (for Flaherty and Ahrens), the Drama Desk Award for Best Musical and was also nominated for two Grammy Awards for its two cast recordings. Its London production (2003) was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best Musical. The show was revived on Broadway in November 2009, where it was again critically acclaimed and nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. In October 2024 it was produced as a two-week gala production at New York City Center, directed by Encores! Artistic Director Lear deBessonet, and again received rave reviews.

Following the success of &quot;Ragtime&quot;, Flaherty and Ahrens returned to Broadway in 2000 with &quot;Seussical&quot;, based on the works of Dr. Seuss, and co-conceived with Eric Idle.

The original Broadway cast album was nominated for a Grammy, and Flaherty also received a Drama Desk nomination for Best Music.

When the stock and amateur rights to the show were released following the Broadway run and its subsequent national tour, &quot;Seussical&quot; immediately became the most performed show in America. In 2008, there was a critically acclaimed off-Broadway revival directed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge, who would also go on to direct the Tony-nominated revival of &quot;Ragtime&quot; the following year.

After writing three shows for Lincoln Center Theatre, Flaherty and Ahrens next returned to Broadway with the musical &quot;Rocky the Musical&quot;. The show premiered in Hamburg, Germany in October 2012. The musical has a book by Thomas Meehan and Sylvester Stallone, based on Stallone&#x27;s original screenplay. &quot;Rocky&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre, officially opening on March 13, 2014. The musical was directed by Alex Timbers, with choreography by Steven Hoggett and Kelly Devine. The show was nominated for 4 Tony Awards and 7 Drama Desk Awards including Outstanding Musical.

Flaherty and Ahrens’ next musical, &quot;Little Dancer&quot;, featured direction and choreography by Susan Stroman. Inspired by the famous sculpture, &quot;Little Dancer, Aged 14&quot; by Edgar Degas, the musical had a reading in 2010 at Lincoln Center Theater and a developmental lab production in June 2010. The show premiered at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s Eisenhower Theater in October 2014. The cast included Rebecca Luker, Boyd Gaines and Tiler Peck. The musical is inspired by true events and focuses on the relationship between a young ballerina and 19th century French painter and sculptor Edgar Degas. Much of the action is set in the Paris Opera Ballet. A re-working of the show, titled &quot;Marie, Dancing Still&quot; (after the name of the young ballerina), had its west coast premiere at Seattle&#x27;s 5th Avenue Theatre in March 2019.

Flaherty&#x27;s next Broadway musical was &quot;Anastasia&quot;, featuring lyrics by Ms. Ahrens, a book by Terrence McNally, and based on the 1956 and 1997 films. The show premiered on Broadway in April 2017 after premiering at Hartford Stage in Connecticut the previous year. The show was subsequently produced internationally in Madrid, Stuttgart, The Netherlands, São Paulo, Mexico City, and Tokyo, and has had several US tours.

During the 2017—2018 Broadway season Flaherty and Ahrens had the rare honor of having two shows running on Broadway at the same time, &quot;Anastasia&quot; and the revival of &quot;Once on This Island.&quot;

For his work in film, Flaherty was nominated for two Academy Awards with lyricist Ahrens (for Best Song and Best Score, the latter shared with David Newman) and two Golden Globe Awards for his first film, &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997). He also composed the film score and wrote the songs for its animated sequel, &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot; (1999). He wrote the original film score for the documentary &quot;After the Storm&quot; (2009), which follows a group of teenagers as they perform Ahrens and Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Once On This Island&quot; in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. He composed the song score and co-wrote the film score for &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot; (2014), which was based on his and Ms. Ahrens&#x27; stage musical of the same name. In 2020, he and Ms. Ahrens contributed a song to the documentary &quot;Nasrin&quot;, which was nominated for the Hollywood Music In Media Award.

Occasionally Mr. Flaherty writes with other collaborators. His &quot;chamber-scale musical,&quot; &quot;Loving Repeating: A Musical of Gertrude Stein&quot;, written with his &quot;Ragtime&quot; director, Frank Galati, premiered in Chicago in February 2006, in a co-production between the About Face Theatre and the Museum of Contemporary Art.[11] The musical won Chicago&#x27;s Joseph Jefferson Award as the “Best New Work” of the year. An earlier version of the show was initially titled &quot;A Long Gay Book&quot;, and had its premiere at Northwestern University in May 2003.[12]

Flaherty collaborated with the director-choreographer Christopher Gattelli on a new &quot;dance-theatre musical&quot;, &quot;In Your Arms&quot;, which premiered at the Old Globe Theatre, San Diego, California, September 24, 2015. The show consists of 10 vignettes on the topic of “romantic destiny”, which were written by Douglas Carter Beane, Nilo Cruz, Christopher Durang, Carrie Fisher, David Henry Hwang, Rajiv Joseph, Terrence McNally, Marsha Norman, Lynn Nottage and Alfred Uhry, all of which were set to music by Flaherty. All the vignettes are danced without words. Lynn Ahrens wrote the lyrics for the title song. The show starred Donna McKechnie and George Chakiris and eighteen powerhouse dancers. The musical had a staged workshop during the summer of 2014 at New York Stage and Film &amp; Vassar&#x27;s Powerhouse Theater at Vassar College..

For the concert hall, Flaherty wrote the music for &quot;With Voices Raised&quot; (text by Lynn Ahrens), which was commissioned by the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1999. It had its world premiere in Boston on July 4, 1999, which was nationally televised, featuring Senator Ted Kennedy as one of the speakers. It was subsequently released on the Pops&#x27; recording &quot;A Splash of Pops&quot; on the RCA Victor Label, July 13, 1999. He also wrote the music for the &quot;American River Suite&quot;, with lyrics by Bill Schermerhorn and commissioned by Macy&#x27;s. The piece premiered in April 2009 at Carnegie Hall by the New York Pops and sung by Idina Menzel, Anika Noni Rose, and the children&#x27;s chorus from the Choir Academy of Harlem. It was broadcast nationally on the Fourth of July of that same year.

He has received several commissions from Carnegie Hall, the Guggenheim Museum and the Boston Pops Orchestra, among others. His most recent concert commission was from the Boston Pops Orchestra for &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Carol&quot; (2014, text by Ms. Ahrens), which was his final collaboration with orchestrator William David Brohn, who won the Tony Award for his orchestrations to &quot;Ragtime.&quot;

With Lynn Ahrens, Flaherty received the Oscar Hammerstein Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2014, was inducted into the Theater Hall Of Fame in 2015 and was nominated to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018.

Flaherty and Ahrens wrote the musical stage adaptation of James Agee&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; and its subsequent stage adaptation, the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;All the Way Home&quot; by Tad Mosel, with &quot;Ragtime&quot; director Frank Galati, who adapted the text and directed. The new musical, titled &quot;Knoxville&quot;, was originally to have had its world premiere at the Asolo Repertory Theatre in April 2020. The production was halted, however, due to the pandemic. It was finally produced two years later, in April 2022, at the Asolo. It starred Jason Danieley as the Author. &quot;Knoxville&quot; was subsequently produced by the Clarence E. Brown Theatre in Knoxville, Tennessee in September 2024, in a revised version under the direction of Josh Rhodes.

She won the Tony Award, Drama Desk Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award for the Broadway musical &quot;Ragtime&quot;. Together with Flaherty, she has written many musicals, including &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Seussical&quot;, &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot;, &quot;Dessa Rose&quot;, &quot;The Glorious Ones&quot;, &quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Little Dancer&quot; and, recently on Broadway, &quot;Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Once on This Island&quot;.

She was a mainstay writer and performer for ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; Ahrens also wrote lyrics for the title song for &quot;After the Storm&quot;, the documentary film about young Hurricane Katrina survivors putting on &quot;Once On This Island&quot;.

==Biography==

Ahrens was born in New York City. She grew up in Neptune Township, New Jersey, where she graduated from Neptune High School on the Jersey shore in 1966. She graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Journalism and English. She is Jewish.

She then began a career in advertising as a copywriter for McCaffrey and McCall. It was her first job out of college. She was living with her ex-husband in Flushing, sleeping on the floor of his sister&#x27;s apartment. While working as a secretary/copywriter, she would bring her guitar to play and write songs during lunch. George Newall was passing by and asked her casually to write a song for &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;. She wrote &quot;The Preamble&quot;, and it went on the air with Ahrens singing it. After that she began regularly writing songs for the show. She subsequently worked as a freelance composer and singer of commercial music, and wrote and produced a number of songs for children&#x27;s television, particularly &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. She began writing for the musical theater in 1982.

She married Neil Costa in 1989.

===Theatre===
Ahrens met Stephen Flaherty at the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop in 1982 and they started working together the following year. Their first collaboration was &quot;Bedazzled&quot;, based on the 1967 film of the same name, but had to abandon it when they could not secure the rights. They did some workshops, where Ira Weitzman noticed them and he was able to get the pair a NEA grant. Weitzman also connected the pair with George C. Wolfe, and they collaborated on a piece called &quot;Antler&quot;, but according to Ahrens, &quot;no one could figure it out.&quot; The pairs&#x27; first produced musical was a children&#x27;s musical, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; for Theatreworks USA.

Their first professionally produced musical together was &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot;, which premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in April 1988. Their next musical was &quot;Once on This Island&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1990 and which was nominated for eight Tony Awards. &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; opened at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center in October 1992 and ran for 36 performances, winning the Tony Award for Andrea Martin as Best Supporting Actress.

&quot;Ragtime&quot; followed, opening on Broadway in January 1998 and running for 834 performances. &quot;Ragtime&quot; was nominated for twelve Tony Awards and won the Best Original Score for Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty in addition to the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics. &quot;Ragtime&quot; was revived on Broadway in 2009, and was nominated for seven Tony Awards.

&quot;Seussical&quot; opened on Broadway in November 2000, and received a Grammy nomination. The musical later ran Off-Broadway in 2007, where it was nominated for the Lucille Lortel Award as Outstanding Revival and the Drama League Award as Distinguished Revival of a Musical. This is one of the most performed musicals in the US.

Ahrens and Flaherty&#x27;s next musicals, &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; (2002), &quot;Dessa Rose&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Glorious Ones&quot; (2007) were produced at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center. They have frequently worked with director and choreographer Graciela Daniele.

They wrote original songs for the Chita Rivera autobiographical show, &quot;Chita Rivera: The Dancer&#x27;s Life&quot;, in 2005.

Their musical version of &quot;Rocky the Musical&quot; premiered in Hamburg, Germany in October 2012. The show is based on the film &quot;Rocky&quot; and has a book by Thomas Meehan.

&quot;Rocky the Musical&quot; opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on February 11, 2014 (previews), and officially opened on March 13, 2014. The musical is directed by Alex Timbers, with boxing choreography by Steven Hoggett and choreography by Kelly Devine. The former occupant of the Winter Garden Theatre, the musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, transferred to the Broadhurst Theatre in November 2013. Andy Karl and Margo Seibert are featured as Rocky Balboa and Adrian.

They have written a dance musical, &quot;Little Dancer&quot;, with direction and choreography by Susan Stroman, about a ballerina and Edgar Degas, which had a reading in 2010 at Lincoln Center Theater and a developmental lab production in June 2012. &quot;Little Dancer&quot; premiered at the Kennedy Center, Eisenhower Theater in October 2014 and closed on November 30, 2014. The cast starred Rebecca Luker, Boyd Gaines and Tiler Peck. The musical had a private reading on March 28, 2016, after having been revised.

Ahrens and Flaherty wrote the songs for the stage adaptation of the film &quot;Anastasia&quot;. The musical premiered at Hartford Stage (Connecticut) from May 12, 2016, to June 12. Director Darko Tresnjak said, &quot;We&#x27;ve kept, I think, six songs from the movie, but there are 16 new numbers. We&#x27;ve kept the best parts of the animated movie, but it really is a new musical.&quot; The book is by Terrence McNally.

With a book by Frank Galati, music by Flaherty, and lyrics by Ahrens, &quot;Knoxville&quot; premiered at the Asolo Repertory Theatre in spring 2020, based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; by James Agee and Pulitzer Prize winning play &quot;All the Way Home&quot; by Tad Mosel. It will star Jason Danieley as Author.

On her working relationship with Flaherty, Ahrens has commented, &quot;Our lives have been very different ... But our sensibilities are very similar.&quot;

==Legacy==
Charles Isherwood wrote of Ahrens and Flaherty: &quot;a few composers and lyricists continue to risk irrelevance by pursuing their own lonely paths. Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens are among them. Mr. Flaherty and Ms. Ahrens, best known for their score for &quot;Ragtime&quot;, continue to see the humanist potential in the medium. They insist on writing musicals that explore the struggles of men and women, as opposed to the synthetic creatures razzle-dazzling Broadway audiences with their preening vulgarity and self-devouring jokes.&quot;

<text>John Francis Bentley (30 January 1839 – 2 March 1902) was an English ecclesiastical architect whose most famous work is the Westminster Cathedral in London, England, built in a style heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture.

==Life==

Bentley was born in Doncaster. In 1839, he was associated with the firm of Holland &amp; Hannan. He was an apt modeller and had tried his hand with success at stone carving. He studied under Henry Clutton, where he worked on St Francis of Assisi Church, Notting Hill, before branching out on his own in 1868. St Francis of Assisi Church was important to Bentley and marked a change in his life. He designed and donated various parts of the church, in particular he was behind the construction of the bapistry and its font. In 1862, Bentley converted to Catholicism. On 16 April 1862, he was baptised in the same font that he himself had designed. For his middle name, he chose &quot;Francis&quot; after the church he helped design and was baptised in. After his baptism there, he continued to donate various furnishings to the church such as the cover of the font.

His first important commission was from Cardinal Manning, for the seminary at Hammersmith. Examples of his work include Holy Rood Church, Watford, St John&#x27;s Beaumont School, Corpus Christi Church, Brixton, St Mary&#x27;s, Cadogan Street, Chelsea (1879), the high altar at St Gabriel&#x27;s, Warwick Square, and St Luke&#x27;s Church, Chiddingstone Causeway (1897), and the Sacred Heart Chapel at the Jesuit Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street. Though much of his work was in the neo-Gothic style, he was selected to create a Byzantine Revival design for Westminster Cathedral.

The great opportunity of Bentley&#x27;s career came in 1894, when he was commissioned to design a new Roman Catholic cathedral in Westminster, London. After deciding on a Byzantine Revival design, Bentley travelled to Italy to study some of the great early Byzantine-influenced cathedrals, such as St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice. Because of illness and an outbreak of cholera in Istanbul, he was unable to complete his tour with a study of the Hagia Sophia. Bentley ended his tour in Venice and returned to London to begin work on Westminster Cathedral.

George Williamson describes him as a person of brusque, reserved manner, but kind and friendly to those who knew him. He had the strongest dislike to the preparation of show drawings and to the system of architectural competition and, being a man wholly lacking in self-assertion, and reticent in conversation, was never as well known in general circles as he deserved to be. His great characteristics as an architect were his careful attention to detail, his solicitude that all the fittings should be in perfect harmony with the building.

In 1874 he married Margaret Annie Fleuss; they had 4 sons and 7 daughters. Their house in Clapham has a blue plaque.

Bentley was awarded the gold medal of the Institute of Architects in February 1902, but never received it, as on 1 March he was seized with paralysis and died the following morning in Clapham. He is buried at St Mary Magdalen Church, Mortlake.

<text>David Gerard Korn (August 28, 1943) is an American UNIX programmer and the author of the Korn shell (&quot;ksh&quot;), a command line interface/programming language.

== Education and work ==

David Korn received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1965 and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from NYU&#x27;s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1969. After working on computer simulations of transsonic airfoils and developing the Korn airfoil, he switched fields to computer science and became a member of technical staff at Bell Laboratories in 1976. He developed Korn shell in response to problems he and his colleagues had with the most commonly used shells at the time, Bourne shell and C shell. The Korn shell pioneered the practice of consultative user interface design, with input from Unix shell users, and from mathematical and cognitive psychologists. The user interface, which included a choice of editing styles (the choices included styles based on vi and on two variants of Emacs) was incorporated into, or copied by, most subsequent Unix shells. The Korn shell is backward-compatible with Bourne shell, but takes a lot of ideas from C shell, such as history viewing and vi-like command line editing.

==Korn shell and Microsoft==
Microsoft once included a version of the Korn shell produced by Mortice Kern Systems (MKS) in a UNIX integration package for Windows NT. This version was not compatible with ksh88 (a Korn shell specification), and Korn mentioned this during a question and answer period of a Microsoft presentation during a USENIX NT conference in Seattle in 1998. Greg Sullivan, a Microsoft product manager who was participating in the presentation, not knowing who the commenter was, insisted that Microsoft had indeed chosen a &quot;real&quot; Korn shell. A polite debate ensued, with Sullivan continuing to insist that the man giving the criticisms was mistaken about the compatibility issues. Sullivan only backed down when an audience member stood up and mentioned that the man making the comments was none other than the eponymous David Korn.

== Other software projects ==
Along with Korn shell, he is also known as the creator of UWIN, an X/Open library for Win32 systems, similar to the later Cygwin. Korn and Kiem-Phong Vo also co-developed sfio, a library for managing I/O streams.

Korn became a Bell Labs fellow in 1984. He currently lives in New York City, and until 2013 worked for AT&amp;T Labs Research in Florham Park, New Jersey, and he retired from Google in early February 2018.

== Family ==
His parents were Florence and Nathaniel Korn. The Korn family moved to Monroe in 1947 where they raised five children.

In 1967 he married Susan Lyn Weiner.

David Korn&#x27;s son Adam used to work at Goldman Sachs.

<text>The Allen was an American automobile built in Fostoria, Ohio between 1913 and 1921. The company used 3.1 liter four-cylinder side-valve Sommers engines, and acquired said company in 1915. The 1920 the Allen 43 was made, featuring bevel-sided touring coachwork and a high-shouldered radiator. Ultimately, sales of this vehicle were not enough to avert the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, which followed in 1921. Willys acquired what little was left. In total, 20,000 vehicles were sold.

<doc id="852894" wikidata="Q666029" url="?curid=852894" title="Snail darter">
<text>The snail darter (Percina tanasi) is a disputed species of small freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. Emblematic of the debate over endangered species management in the United States, more recent phylogenetic studies indicate that it may actually be an eastern population of the stargazing darter (&quot;Percina uranidea&quot;). 

It is found in East Tennessee freshwater in the United States and in small portions of northern Alabama and Georgia. First recorded in 1973, the snail darter was listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973 by 1975. The species was at the center of a major environmental law controversy that involved a lawsuit seeking to halt the completion of Tellico Dam, which posed a risk of extinction for the snail darter by destroying its only known habitat. The case was eventually appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld protections for the snail darter under the ESA in its 1978 decision &quot;Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill&quot;. In spite of this, Congress subsequently passed legislation specifically exempting the Tellico Dam Project from the ESA (“Tellico Dam”). The dam project and inundation of the reservoir were completed in 1979.

In 1978, prior to the closure of the floodgates, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency launched a recovery plan to preserve the snail darter by transferring the species to other river systems. Its native range was originally in the lower parts of the Little Tennessee River, the Sequatchie River, and in Chickamauga Creek, but was later eliminated from the Little Tennessee River by the completion of Tellico Dam. The species was then transplanted into the Hiwassee River in southeastern Tennessee.

The species inhabits large creeks or deeper portions of rivers and reservoirs with gravel and sand shoals substrate. The snail darter spawns between February and mid-April with the female producing 600 eggs which drift downstream. Juveniles occupy slack water habitats and migrate upstream to the breeding ground. The lifespan of the snail darter ranges between 2 and 4 years. The snail darter adult length ranges between . The species&#x27; diet consists mostly of snails and insects (caddisflies, midges, and blackflies). Snail darters have camouflage dorsal patterns and burrow in the substrate to conserve energy and hide from predators. They are largely preyed upon by banded sculpin (&quot;Cottus carolinae&quot;). The specific name &quot;tanasi&quot; derives from capital of the Cherokee Nation located on the Little Tennessee River where the species was first recorded. The species was relisted as threatened in 1984 after being successfully transplanted into other river systems. In 2022, it was delisted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service due to recovery.

==Taxonomy==
The snail darter was first formally described in 1976 by the American ichthyologist David A. Etnier with the type locality given as the Little Tennessee River near mouth of Coytee Spring in Loudon County, Tennessee. The specific name refers to the settlement of Tanasi in Monroe County, Tennessee which was the capital of the Cherokee Nation until 1725, and the origin of the name &quot;Tennessee&quot;. It is placed in the subgenus &quot;Imostoma&quot; and was thought to be closely related to the stargazing darter (&quot;Percina uranidea&quot;). 

The snail darter&#x27;s taxonomic and conservation status was first called into question in 2015, when a population of an identical fish was discovered on the Alabama-Mississippi border, far from the species&#x27; range. Building on this finding, a 2018 dissertation using molecular phylogenetics found the snail darter to most likely represent an eastern population of the stargazing darter. This was officially affirmed by Ghezelayagh &quot;et al&quot; (2025), who found the snail darter to be an allopatric eastern population of the stargazing darter, which is found in the western half of the Mississippi Basin. The two species were originally distinguished by morphological features such as fin ray count, but the study found both to have the same average number of fin rays and the level of morphological variation to be insufficient for considering them distinct species. The snail darter was also found to taxonomically nestle within the stargazing darter, leading to them being considered synonymous. It has been suggested that the snail darter may have been possibly intentionally misidentified as a distinct species in the midst of a campaign against the Tellico Dam. This accusation ignores the fact that the formal species description (Etnier, 1976) was thoroughly peer-reviewed before publication and has withstood decades of scrutiny—even from biologists employed by TVA. Etnier himself acknowledged that genetic affinities between snail darters and stargazing darters would be instrumental in fully understanding their degree of relatedness and divergence (Etnier, 1976:487 ).

==Geographic distribution==
The original range of the snail darter was thought to be strictly in the lower portion of the Little Tennessee River with a few individuals dispersing into the headwaters of Watts Bar Lake below Fort Loudon Dam. Prior to the completion of the Tellico Dam in 1979, TVA biologists made several efforts to relocate the remaining individuals of the species into other river systems. In 1975 the species was successfully transplanted to the Hiwassee River, where the population has risen to about 2,500 individuals. Another transplant attempt was made to the Nolichucky River in 1975, but was later stopped by the discovery of another federally protected species, the sharphead darter (&quot;Etheostoma acuticeps&quot;). Other unsuccessful transplant locations included lower parts of the Holston River, French Broad River, and middle Elk River. With the completion of the Tellico Dam, the snail darter was extirpated from the Little Tennessee River. In 1980, additional populations of snail darters were discovered in South Chickamauga Creek in Chattanooga, the lower portion of Big Sewee Creek in Meigs County, the lower Sequatchie River in Marion County, Little River in Blount County, and the lower portion of Paint Rock River in Madison County, Alabama. These discoveries indicated the snail darter&#x27;s possible range as being from the lower reaches of major tributaries of the Tennessee River from the northward bend in Alabama upstream; the snail darter was reclassified from endangered to threatened in July 1984.

Additional populations were identified prior to the species&#x27; 2022 delisting, including in the Flint River, although the snail darter has not been found there since 2012, in the Elk River and in Bear Creek, all tributaries of the Tennessee River. TVA surveys have located the snail darter in Chickamauga Lake, Nickajack Lake, Guntersville Lake, Wheeler Lake, the Pickwick Reservoir and part of the Fort Loudoun Lake, as well as a finding of juveniles in Watts Barr Reservoir. Reproduction is believed to be occurring in Chickamauga Lake, Nickajack Lake and Wheeler Lake.

==Ecology==
The snail darters are found in gravel shoals free of silt and aquatic plants, with moderate to strong currents, and moderate depths. The substrate generally consists of dark micaceous sand, with little to no silt, and 25 to 50 percent of the area scattered with gravel. Agricultural development has also affected the water clarity, and silt run-off causes problem for reproduction and migration. In 1976, the winter temperature ranged from 41° to 54 °F, and summer temperature averaged near 64 °F in the Little Tennessee River. These temperature fluctuations are due to impoundments, resulting in colder water when the dam is discharging and warming water when flow is diminished. Current velocities ranged from a moderate 0.25 m/s to nearly 0.7 m/s. The snail darter actively feeds in spring and winter with a diet consisting of 60% small gastropods (5mm or less in diameter) and other prey such as caddisflies, midges, and blackflies. Snails are the preferred food source until late spring when they outgrow the gape size of the fish, resulting in a diet change to insect larvae. The most effective predator on adult snail darters is &quot;Cottus carolinae&quot; while &quot;Salmo trutta&quot;, &quot;Morone chrysops&quot;, &quot;Sizostedion canadense&quot;, and other darters would prey on eggs and juveniles. The snail darters&#x27; dorsal patterns and coloration allow the fish to camouflage with the substrate to avoid detection from predators. Burrowing behavior also is a defense mechanism and can help conserve energy for the current.

==Life history==
The snail darter spawning occurs in early February through April when water temperatures range from 12°-13 °C. The female produces over 600 eggs and has multiple mates over the course of two weeks. The snail darter does not display territorial behavior during the breeding, unlike other species of darters. The eggs are deposited on the shallowest portion of gravel shoals and hatch after 15–20 days. Silt run-off can deprive eggs of oxygen, leading to higher mortality. When eggs hatch, the larvae drift downstream to deeper, calmer water and feed on zooplankton. The larvae are phototaxic (attracted to light) which may have implications regarding diurnal movements in the water column or depth maintenance. After 3 to 4 months of age, the juveniles migrate upstream during spring, and remain at the breeding shoal areas. The snail darter reaches sexual maturity at one year. The snail darter life span is 2 to 4 years, depending on predation and access to the breeding ground. More research on the snail darter life history is needed.

==Current management==
The snail darter was a federally protected species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 between 1975 and 2022 as a result of habitat destruction from the completion of the Tellico Dam. Another factor in the decline of snail darters is siltation, which degrades spawning habitat and food availability. Other influences include agricultural development, environmental contamination and pollution, and channel modification, which affect water clarity, reproduction success, and migration patterns. A recovery plan was made and completed on May 5, 1983. The recovery efforts focused on finding and transplanting individuals to suitable habitat areas in the Tennessee River, continuing research to locate already-existing populations, and maintaining current populations of snail darters. Programs are in progress to educate the public and to work with state officials and local citizens to broaden protection efforts. However, more recent research on snail darters is still needed to better manage and protect the species and its habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, TVA, Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency, and other law enforcement agencies are utilizing legislation and regulations to protect the snail darter during the recovery effort. It is recommended that at least five separate viable populations should be maintained, the species should be kept on the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, and federal permits to collect the species should be required.

On October 5, 2022, the US Fish and Wildlife ruled that the species is no longer threatened. It was removed from the Federal List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife on November 4, 2022. In 2025, Ghezelayagh &quot;et al&quot; determined that the snail darter was likely not a distinct species after all, and would have not likely qualified for ESA protections had its taxonomic identity been known earlier. They noted that the resolution of this taxonomic issue via molecular phylogenetics provides a reference-based framework for species delimitation and conservation. On the study&#x27;s significance, author Thomas J. Near noted &quot;While we&#x27;re losing the snail darter as a biological conservation icon, our findings demonstrate the capability of genomics, in addition to studying an organism&#x27;s observable features, to accurately delimit species&quot;. Near also noted that &quot;[the study] strengthens the Endangered Species Act, because it shows how science can be revised with additional information and newer perspectives,&quot; and &quot;The methods we use in this study are leading to the discovery of scores of new species, many of which are more endangered.&quot; Despite the study&#x27;s conclusions, the protections afforded by the ESA still allowed the eastern population of stargazing darter to see significant recovery throughout its range.

<text>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man is a 1964 book by Marshall McLuhan, in which the author proposes that the media, not the content that they carry, should be the focus of study. He suggests that the medium affects the society in which it plays a role mainly by the characteristics of the medium rather than the content. The book is considered a pioneering study in media theory.

McLuhan pointed to the light bulb as an example. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that &quot;a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence&quot;.

More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society—in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children&#x27;s shows or violent programming. He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

The book is the source of the well-known phrase &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. It was a leading indicator of the upheaval of local cultures by increasingly globalized values. The book greatly influenced academics, writers, and social theorists. The book discussed the radical analysis of social change, how society is shaped, and reflected by communications media.

==Summary==
Throughout &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, McLuhan uses historical quotes and anecdotes to probe the ways in which new forms of media change the perceptions of societies, with specific focus on the &quot;effects&quot; of each medium as opposed to the content that is transmitted by each medium. McLuhan identified two types of media: &quot;hot&quot; media and &quot;cool&quot; media, drawing from French anthropologist Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s distinction between hot and cold societies.

This terminology does not refer to the temperature or emotional intensity, nor some kind of classification, but to the degree of participation. Cool media are those that require high participation from users, due to their low definition (the receiver/user must fill in missing information). Since many senses may be used, they foster involvement. Conversely, hot media are low in audience participation due to their high resolution or definition. Film, for example, is defined as a hot medium, since in the context of a dark movie theater, the viewer is completely captivated, and one primary sense—visual—is filled in high definition. In contrast, television is a cool medium, since many other things may be going on and the viewer has to integrate all of the sounds and sights in the context.

In Part One, McLuhan discusses the differences between hot and cool media and the ways that one medium translates the content of another medium. Briefly, &quot;the content of a medium is always another medium&quot;.

In Part Two, McLuhan analyzes each medium (circa 1964) in a manner that exposes the form, rather than the content of each medium. In order, McLuhan covers:

* The Spoken Word;
* The Written Word (i.e., manuscript or incunabulum);
* Roads and Paper Routes;
* Numbers;
* Clothing;
* Housing;
* Money;
* Clocks;
* The Print (i.e., pictorial lithograph or woodcut);
* Comics;
* The Printed Word (i.e., typography);
* The Wheel;
* The Bicycle and Airplane;
* The Photograph;
* The Press;
* The Motorcar;
* Ads;
* Games; 
* The Telegraph;
* The Typewriter;
* The Telephone;
* The Phonograph;
* Movies;
* Radio;
* Television;
* Weapons; and
* Automation.

==Concept of &quot;media&quot;==

McLuhan uses interchangeably the words &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;media&quot;, and &quot;technology&quot;.

For McLuhan a &quot;medium&quot; is &quot;any extension of ourselves&quot; or, more broadly, &quot;any new technology&quot;. Contrastly, in addition to forms such as newspapers, television, and radio, McLuhan includes the light bulb, cars, speech, and language in his definition of &quot;media&quot;: all of these, as technologies, mediate our communication; their forms or structures affect how we perceive and understand the world around us.

McLuhan says that conventional pronouncements fail in studying media because they focus on content, which blinds them to the psychic and social effects that define the medium&#x27;s true significance. McLuhan observes that any medium &quot;amplifies or accelerates existing processes&quot;, introducing a &quot;change of scale or pace or shape or pattern into human association, affairs, and action&quot;, which results in &quot;psychic, and social consequences&quot;. This is the real &quot;meaning or message&quot; brought by a medium, a social and psychic message, and it depends solely on the medium itself, regardless of the &#x27;content&#x27; emitted by it. This is basically the meaning of &quot;the medium is the message&quot;.

To demonstrate the flaws of the common belief that the message resides in how the medium is used (the content), McLuhan provides the example of mechanization, pointing out that regardless of the product (e.g., corn flakes or Cadillacs), the impact on workers and society is the same.

In a further exemplification of the common unawareness of the real meaning of media, McLuhan says that people &quot;describe the scratch but not the itch&quot;. As an example of &quot;media experts&quot; who follow this fundamentally flawed approach, McLuhan quotes a statement from &quot;General&quot; David Sarnoff (head of RCA), calling it the &quot;voice of the current somnambulism&quot;. Each medium &quot;adds itself on to what we already are&quot;, realizing &quot;amputations and extensions&quot; to our senses and bodies, shaping them in a new technical form. As appealing as this remaking of ourselves may seem, it really puts us in a &quot;narcissistic hypnosis&quot; that prevents us from seeing the real nature of the media. McLuhan also says that a characteristic of every medium is that its content is always another (previous) medium. For an example in the new millennium, the Internet is a medium whose content is various media which came before it—the printing press, radio and the moving image.

An overlooked, constantly repeated understanding McLuhan has is that moral judgement (for better or worse) of an individual using media is very difficult, because of the psychic effects media have on society and their users. Moreover, media and technology, for McLuhan, are not necessarily inherently &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; but bring about great change in a society&#x27;s way of life. Awareness of the changes are what McLuhan seemed to consider most important, so that, in his estimation, the only sure disaster would be a society not perceiving a technology&#x27;s effects on their world, especially the chasms and tensions between generations.

The only possible way to discern the real &quot;principles and lines of force&quot; of a medium (or structure) is to stand aside from it and be detached from it. This is necessary to avoid the powerful ability of any medium to put the unwary into a &quot;subliminal state of Narcissus trance&quot;, imposing &quot;its own assumptions, bias, and values&quot; on him. Instead, while in a detached position, one can predict and control the effects of the medium. This is difficult because &quot;the spell can occur immediately upon contact, as in the first bars of a melody&quot;. One historical example of such detachment is Alexis de Tocqueville and the medium of typography. He was in such position because he was highly literate. Instead, an historical example of the embrace of technological assumptions happened with the Western world, which, heavily influenced by literacy, took its principles of &quot;uniform and continuous and sequential&quot; for the actual meaning of &quot;rational&quot;.

McLuhan argues that media are &quot;languages&quot;, with their own structures and systems of grammar, and that they can be studied as such. He believed that media have &quot;effects&quot; in that they continually shape and re-shape the ways in which individuals, societies, and cultures perceive and understand the world. In his view, the purpose of media studies is to make visible what is invisible: the effects of media technologies themselves, rather than simply the messages they convey. Media studies therefore, ideally, seeks to identify patterns within a medium and in its interactions with other media. Based on his studies in New Criticism, McLuhan argued that technologies are to words as the surrounding culture is to a poem: the former derive their meaning from the context formed by the latter. Like Harold Innis, McLuhan looked to the broader culture and society within which a medium conveys its messages to identify patterns of the medium&#x27;s effects.

===&quot;Hot&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; media===

In the first part of &quot;Understanding Media,&quot; McLuhan also states that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, such as film, were &quot;hot&quot; - that is, they enhance one single sense, in this case vision, in such a manner that a person does not need to exert much effort in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with &quot;cool&quot; TV, which he claimed requires more effort on the part of viewer to determine meaning, and comics, which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray. A movie is thus said by McLuhan to be &quot;hot&quot;, intensifying one single sense &quot;high definition&quot;, demanding a viewer&#x27;s attention, and a comic book to be &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;low definition&quot;, requiring much more conscious participation by the reader to extract value.

&quot;Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than a dialogue.&quot;

Hot media usually, but not always, provide complete involvement without considerable stimulus. For example, print occupies visual space, uses visual senses, but can immerse its reader. Hot media favour analytical precision, quantitative analysis and sequential ordering, as they are usually sequential, linear and logical. They emphasize one sense (for example, of sight or sound) over the others. For this reason, hot media also include radio, as well as film, the lecture and photography.

Cool media, on the other hand, are usually, but not always, those that provide little involvement with substantial stimulus. They require more active participation on the part of the user, including the perception of abstract patterning and simultaneous comprehension of all parts. Therefore, according to McLuhan cool media include television, as well as the seminar and cartoons. McLuhan describes the term &quot;cool media&quot; as emerging from jazz and popular music and, in this context, is used to mean &quot;detached&quot;.

== Examples of media and their messages ==
==Critiques of &quot;Understanding Media&quot;==
Some theorists have attacked McLuhan&#x27;s definition and treatment of the word &quot;medium&quot; for being too simplistic. Umberto Eco, for instance, contends that McLuhan&#x27;s medium conflates channels, codes, and messages under the overarching term of the medium, confusing the vehicle, internal code, and content of a given message in his framework.

In &quot;Media Manifestos&quot;, Régis Debray also takes issue with McLuhan&#x27;s envisioning of the medium. Like Eco, he too is ill at ease with this reductionist approach, summarizing its ramifications as follows:

 The list of objections could be and has been lengthened indefinitely: confusing technology itself with its use of the media makes of the media an abstract, undifferentiated force and produces its image in an imaginary &quot;public&quot; for mass consumption; the magical naivete of supposed causalities turns the media into a catch-all and contagious &quot;mana&quot;; apocalyptic millenarianism invents the figure of a homo mass-mediaticus without ties to historical and social context, and so on.

Furthermore, when &quot;Wired&quot; interviewed him in 1995, Debray stated that he views McLuhan &quot;more as a poet than a historian, a master of intellectual collage rather than a systematic analyst... McLuhan overemphasizes the technology behind cultural change at the expense of the usage that the messages and codes make of that technology.&quot;

Dwight Macdonald, in turn, reproached McLuhan for his focus on television and for his &quot;aphoristic&quot; style of prose, which he believes left &quot;Understanding Media&quot; filled with &quot;contradictions, non-sequiturs, facts that are distorted and facts that are not facts, exaggerations, and chronic rhetorical vagueness&quot;.

Additionally, Brian Winston’s &quot;Misunderstanding Media&quot;, published in 1986, chides McLuhan for what he sees as his technologically deterministic stances. Raymond Williams and James W. Carey further this point of contention, claiming:

The work of McLuhan was a particular culmination of an aesthetic theory which became, negatively, a social theory ... It is an apparently sophisticated technological determinism which has the significant effect of indicating a social and cultural determinism ... If the medium - whether print or television – is the cause, of all other causes, all that men ordinarily see as history is at once reduced to effects. (Williams 1990, 126/7)

David Carr states that there has been a long line of &quot;academics who have made a career out of deconstructing McLuhan’s effort to define the modern media ecosystem&quot;, whether it be due to what they see as McLuhan&#x27;s ignorance toward socio-historical context or the style of his argument.

While some critics have taken issue with McLuhan&#x27;s writing style and mode of argument, McLuhan himself urged readers to think of his work as &quot;probes&quot; or &quot;mosaics&quot; offering a toolkit approach to thinking about the media. His eclectic writing style has also been praised for its postmodern sensibilities and suitability for virtual space.

==Exploring theories==

McLuhan&#x27;s theories about &quot;the medium is the message&quot; link culture and society. A recurrent topic is the contrast between oral cultures and print culture.

Each new form of media, according to the analysis of McLuhan, shapes messages differently thereby requiring new filters to be engaged in the experience of viewing and listening to those messages.

McLuhan argues that as &quot;sequence yields to the simultaneous, one is in the world of the structure and of configuration&quot;. The main example is the passage from mechanization (processes fragmented into sequences, lineal connections) to electric speed (faster up to simultaneity, creative configuration, structure, total field).

Howard Rheingold comments upon McLuhan&#x27;s &quot;the medium is the message&quot; in relation to the convergence of technology, specifically the computer. In his book &quot;Tools for Thought&quot; Rheingold explains the notion of the universal machine - the original conception of the computer. Eventually computers will no longer use information but knowledge to operate, in effect &quot;thinking&quot;. If in the future computers (the medium) are everywhere, then what becomes of McLuhan&#x27;s message?

==Historical examples==
According to McLuhan, the French Revolution and American Revolution happened under the push of print whereas the preexistence of a strong oral culture in Britain prevented such an effect.
