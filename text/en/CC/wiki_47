<text>The Herero and Nama genocide or Namibian genocide, formerly known also as the Herero and Namaqua genocide, was a campaign of ethnic extermination and collective punishment which was waged against the Herero (Ovaherero) and the Nama in German South West Africa (now Namibia) by the German Empire. It was the first genocide to begin in the 20th century, occurring between 1904 and 1908. In January 1904, the Herero people, who were led by Samuel Maharero, and the Nama people, who were led by Captain Hendrik Witbooi, rebelled against German colonial rule. On 12 January 1904, they killed more than 100 German settlers in the area of Okahandja.

In August 1904, German General Lothar von Trotha defeated the Ovaherero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of dehydration. In October, the Nama people also rebelled against the Germans, only to suffer a similar fate. Between 24,000 and 100,000 Hereros and 10,000 Nama were killed in the genocide. The first phase of the genocide was characterized by widespread death from starvation and dehydration, due to the prevention of the Herero from leaving the Namib desert by German forces. Once defeated, thousands of Hereros and Namas were imprisoned in concentration camps, where the majority died of diseases, abuse, and exhaustion.

In 1985, the United Nations&#x27; Whitaker Report classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century. In 2004, the German government recognised the events in what a German minister qualified as an &quot;apology&quot; but ruled out financial compensation for the victims&#x27; descendants. In July 2015, the German government and the speaker of the Bundestag officially called the events a &quot;genocide&quot;; however, it refused to consider reparations at that time. Despite this, the last batch of skulls and other remains of slaughtered tribesmen which were taken to Germany to promote racial superiority were taken back to Namibia in 2018, with , a German Protestant bishop, describing the event as &quot;the first genocide of the 20th century&quot;.

In May 2021, the German government issued an official statement in which it said that Germany&quot;apologizes and bows before the descendants of the victims. Today, more than 100 years later, Germany asks for forgiveness for the sins of their forefathers. It is not possible to undo what has been done. But the suffering, inhumanity and pain inflicted on the tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children by Germany during the war in what is today Namibia must not be forgotten. It must serve as a warning against racism and genocide.&quot; The same year, the German government agreed to pay €1.1 billion over 30 years to fund projects in communities that were impacted by the genocide.

== Background ==



The original inhabitants of what is now Namibia were the San and the Khoekhoe.

Herero, who speak a Bantu language, were originally a group of cattle herders who migrated into what is now Namibia during the mid-18th century. The Herero seized vast swathes of the arable upper plateaus which were ideal for cattle grazing. Agricultural duties, which were minimal, were assigned to enslaved Khoisan and Bushmen. Over the rest of the 18th century, the Herero slowly drove the Khoisan into the dry, rugged hills to the south and east.

The Hereros were a pastoral people whose entire way of life centred on their cattle. The Herero language, while limited in its vocabulary for most areas, contains more than a thousand words for the colours and markings of cattle. The Hereros were content to live in peace as long as their cattle were safe and well-pastured, but became formidable warriors when their cattle were threatened.

According to Robert Gaudi, &quot;The newcomers, much taller and more fiercely warlike than the indigenous Khoisan people, were possessed of the fierceness that comes from basing one&#x27;s way of life on a single source: everything they valued, all wealth and personal happiness, had to do with cattle. Regarding the care and protection of their herds, the Herero showed themselves utterly merciless, and far more &#x27;savage&#x27; than the Khoisan had ever been. Because of their dominant ways and elegant bearing, the few Europeans who encountered Herero tribesmen in the early days regarded them as the region&#x27;s &#x27;natural aristocrats.

By the time of the Scramble for Africa, the area which was occupied by the Herero was known as Damaraland. The Nama were pastorals and traders and lived to the south of the Herero.

In 1883, Adolf Lüderitz, a German merchant, purchased a stretch of coast near Lüderitz Bay (Angra Pequena) from the reigning chief. The terms of the purchase were fraudulent, but the German government nonetheless established a protectorate over it. At that time, it was the only overseas German territory deemed suitable for European settlement.

Chief of the neighbouring Herero, Maharero rose to power by uniting all the Herero. Faced with repeated attacks by the Khowesin, a clan of the Khoekhoe under Hendrik Witbooi, he signed a protection treaty on 21 October 1885 with Imperial Germany&#x27;s colonial governor Heinrich Ernst Göring (father of Hermann Göring) but did not cede the land of the Herero. This treaty was renounced in 1888 due to lack of German support against Witbooi but it was reinstated in 1890.

The Herero leaders repeatedly complained about violation of this treaty, as Herero women and girls were raped by Germans, a crime that the German judges and prosecutors were reluctant to punish.

In 1890 Maharero&#x27;s son, Samuel, signed a great deal of land over to the Germans in return for helping him to ascend to the Ovaherero throne, and to subsequently be established as paramount chief. German involvement in ethnic fighting ended in tenuous peace in 1894. In that year, Theodor Leutwein became governor of the territory, which underwent a period of rapid development, while the German government sent the (imperial colonial troops) to pacify the region.

=== German colonial policy ===
Both German colonial authorities and European settlers envisioned a predominantly white &quot;new African Germany,&quot; wherein the native populations would be put onto reservations and their land distributed among settlers and companies. Under German colonial rule, colonists were encouraged to seize land and cattle from the native Herero and Nama peoples and to subjugate them as slave laborers.

Resentment brewed among the native populations over their loss of status and property to German ranchers arriving in South West Africa, and the dismantling of traditional political hierarchies. Previously ruling tribes were reduced to the same status as the other tribes they had previously ruled over and enslaved. This resentment contributed to the Herero Wars that began in 1904.

Major Theodor Leutwein, the Governor of German South West Africa, was well aware of the effect of the German colonial rule on Hereros. He later wrote: &quot;The Hereros from early years were a freedom-loving people, courageous and proud beyond measure. On the one hand, there was the progressive extension of German rule over them, and on the other their own sufferings increasing from year to year.&quot;

==== The Dietrich case ====
In January 1903, a German trader named Dietrich was walking from his homestead to the nearby town of Omaruru to buy a new horse. Halfway to Dietrich&#x27;s destination, a wagon carrying the son of a Herero chief, his wife, and their son stopped by. In a common courtesy in Hereroland, the chief&#x27;s son offered Dietrich a ride.

That night, however, Dietrich got very drunk and after everyone was asleep, he attempted to rape the wife of the chief&#x27;s son. When she resisted, Dietrich shot her dead. When he was tried for murder in Windhoek, Dietrich denied attempting to rape his victim. He alleged that he awoke thinking the camp was under attack and fired blindly into the darkness. The killing of the Herero woman, he claimed, was an unfortunate accident. The court acquitted him, alleging that Dietrich was suffering from &quot;tropical fever&quot; and temporary insanity.

According to Leutwein, the murder &quot;aroused extraordinary interest in Hereroland, especially since the murdered woman had been the wife of the son of a Chief and the daughter of another. Everywhere the question was asked: Have White people the right to shoot native women?&quot;

Governor Leutwein intervened. He had the Public Prosecutor appeal Dietrich&#x27;s acquittal, a second trial took place (before the colony&#x27;s supreme court), and this time Dietrich was found guilty of manslaughter and imprisoned. The move prompted violent objections of German settlers who considered Leutwein a &quot;race traitor&quot;.

=== Rising tension ===
In 1903, some of the Nama clans rose in revolt under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi. A number of factors led the Herero to join them in January 1904.

One of the major issues was land rights. In 1903 the Herero learned of a plan to divide their territory with a railway line and set up reservations where they would be concentrated. The Herero had already ceded more than a quarter of their territory to German colonists by 1903, before the Otavi railway line running from the African coast to inland German settlements was completed. Completion of this line would have made the German colonies much more accessible and would have ushered a new wave of Europeans into the area.

Historian Horst Drechsler states that there was discussion of the possibility of establishing and placing the Herero in native reserves and that this was further proof of the German colonists&#x27; sense of ownership over the land. Drechsler illustrates the gap between the rights of a European and an African; the (German Colonial League) held that, in regards to legal matters, the testimony of seven Africans was equivalent to that of a colonist. According to Bridgman, there were racial tensions underlying these developments; the average German colonist viewed native Africans as a lowly source of cheap labour, and others welcomed their extermination.

A new policy on debt collection, enforced in November 1903, also played a role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist moneylenders at extreme interest rates (see usury). For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on, as collateral. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that German officials were sympathetic to the moneylenders who were about to lose what they were owed.

Racial tension was also at play. The German settlers often referred to black Africans as &quot;baboons&quot; and treated them with contempt.

One missionary reported: &quot;The real cause of the bitterness among the Hereros toward the Germans is without question the fact that the average German looks down upon the natives as being about on the same level as the higher primates (&#x27;baboon&#x27; being their favourite term for the natives) and treat them like animals. The settler holds that the native has a right to exist only in so far as he is useful to the white man. This sense of contempt led the settlers to commit violence against the Hereros.&quot;

The contempt manifested itself particularly in the concubinage of native women. In a practice referred to in &quot;Südwesterdeutsch&quot; as &quot;Verkafferung&quot;, native women were taken by male European traders and ranchers both willingly and by force.

=== Revolts ===
In 1903, the Hereros saw an opportunity to revolt. At that time, there was a distant Khoisan tribe in the south called the Bondelzwarts, who resisted German demands to register their guns. The Bondelzwarts engaged in a firefight with the German authorities which led to three Germans killed and a fourth wounded. The situation deteriorated further, and the governor of the Herero colony, Major Theodor Leutwein, went south to take personal command, leaving almost no troops in the north.

The Herero revolted in early 1904, killing between 123 and 150 German settlers, as well as seven Boers and three women, in what Nils Ole Oermann calls a &quot;desperate surprise attack&quot;.

The timing of their attack was carefully planned. After successfully asking a large Herero clan to surrender their weapons, Governor Leutwein was convinced that they and the rest of the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the German troops stationed in the colony. Led by Chief Samuel Maharero, the Herero surrounded Okahandja and cut railroad and telegraph links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any Englishmen, Boers, uninvolved peoples, women and children in general, or German missionaries. The Herero revolts catalysed a separate revolt and attack on Fort Namutoni in the north of the country a few weeks later by the Ondonga.

A Herero warrior interviewed by German authorities in 1895 had described his people&#x27;s traditional way of dealing with suspected cattle rustlers, a treatment which, during the uprising, was regularly extended to German soldiers and civilians, &quot;We came across a few Khoisan whom of course we killed. I myself helped to kill one of them. First we cut off his ears, saying, &#x27;You will never hear Herero cattle lowing.&#x27; Then we cut off his nose, saying, &#x27;Never again shall you smell Herero cattle.&#x27; And then we cut off his lips, saying, &#x27;You shall never again taste Herero cattle.&#x27; And finally we cut his throat.&quot;

According to Robert Gaudi, &quot;Leutwein knew that the wrath of the German Empire was about to fall on them and hoped to soften the blow. He sent desperate messages to Chief Samuel Maherero in hopes of negotiating an end to the war. In this, Leutwein acted on his own, heedless of the prevailing mood in Germany, which called for bloody revenge.&quot;

The Hereros, however, were emboldened by their success and had come to believe that, &quot;the Germans were too cowardly to fight in the open,&quot; and rejected Leutwein&#x27;s offers of peace.

One missionary wrote, &quot;The Germans are filled with fearful hate. I must really call it a blood thirst against the Hereros. One hears nothing but talk of &#x27;cleaning up,&#x27; &#x27;executing,&#x27; &#x27;shooting down to the last man,&#x27; &#x27;no pardon,&#x27; etc.&quot;

According to Robert Gaudi, &quot;The Germans suffered more than defeat in the early months of 1904; they suffered humiliation, their brilliant modern army unable to defeat a rabble of &#x27;half-naked savages.&#x27; Cries in the Reichstag, and from the Kaiser himself, for total eradication of the Hereros grew strident. When a leading member of the Social Democratic Party pointed out that the Hereros were as human as any German and possessed immortal souls, he was howled down by the entire conservative side of the legislature.&quot;

Leutwein was forced to request reinforcements and an experienced officer from the German government in Berlin. Lieutenant-General Lothar von Trotha was appointed commander-in-chief () of South West Africa, arriving with an expeditionary force of 10,000 troops on 11 June.

Meanwhile, Leutwein was subordinate to the civilian Colonial Department of the Prussian Foreign Office, which was supported by Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow, while General Trotha reported to the military German General Staff, which was supported by Emperor Wilhelm II.

Leutwein wanted to defeat the most determined Herero rebels and negotiate a surrender with the remainder to achieve a political settlement. Trotha, however, planned to crush the native resistance through military force. He stated that:
By late spring of 1904, German troops were pouring into the colony. In August 1904, the main Herero forces were surrounded and crushed at the Battle of Waterberg.

== Genocide ==
In 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II had been enraged by the killing of Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the Imperial German minister plenipotentiary in Beijing, during the Boxer Rebellion. The Kaiser took it as a personal insult from a people he viewed as racially inferior, all the more because of his obsession with the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. On 27 July 1900, the Kaiser gave the infamous &quot;Hunnenrede&quot; (Hun speech) in Bremerhaven to German soldiers being sent to Imperial China, ordering them to show the Boxers no mercy and to behave like Attila&#x27;s Huns. General von Trotha had served in China, and was chosen in 1904 to command the expedition to German South West Africa precisely because of his record in China. In 1904, the Kaiser was furious by the latest revolt in his colonial empire by a people whom he also viewed as inferior, and took the Herero rebellion as a personal insult, just as he had viewed the Boxers&#x27; assassination of Baron von Ketteler. The tactless and bloodthirsty language that Wilhelm II used about the Herero people in 1904 is strikingly similar to the language he had used about the Chinese Boxers in 1900. However, the Kaiser denied, together with Chancellor von Bülow, von Trotha&#x27;s request to quickly quell the rebellion.

No written order by Wilhelm II ordering or authorising genocide has survived. In February 1945 an Allied bombing raid destroyed the building housing all of the documents of the Prussian Army from the Imperial period. Despite this fact, surviving documents indicate that Trotha used the same tactics in Namibia that he had used in China, only on a much vaster scale. It is also known that throughout the genocide Trotha sent regular reports to both the General Staff and to the Kaiser. Historian Jeremy-Sarkin Hughes believes that regardless of whether or not a written order was given, the Kaiser must have given General von Trotha verbal orders. According to Hughes, the fact that Trotha was decorated and not court-martialed after the genocide became public knowledge lends support to the thesis that he was acting under orders.

General von Trotha commented: &quot;I know the tribes of Africa…. They are all alike. They only respond to force. It was and is my policy to use force with terrorism and even brutality. I shall annihilate the African tribes with streams of blood and streams of gold.&quot; General von Trotha stated his proposed solution to end the resistance of the Herero people in a letter, before the Battle of Waterberg:
Trotha&#x27;s troops defeated 3,000–5,000 Herero combatants at the Battle of Waterberg on 11–12 August 1904 but were unable to encircle and annihilate the retreating survivors.

The pursuing German forces prevented groups of Herero from breaking from the main body of the fleeing force and pushed them further into the desert. As exhausted Herero fell to the ground, unable to go on, German soldiers killed men, women, and children. Jan Cloete, acting as a guide for the Germans, witnessed the atrocities committed by the German troops and deposed the following statement:
A portion of the Herero escaped the Germans and went to the Omaheke Desert, hoping to reach British Bechuanaland; fewer than 1,000 Herero managed to reach Bechuanaland, where they were granted asylum by the British authorities. To prevent them from returning, Trotha ordered the desert to be sealed off. German patrols later found skeletons around holes deep that had been dug in a vain attempt to find water. Some sources also state that the German colonial army systematically poisoned desert water wells. Maherero and 500–1,500 men crossed the Kalahari into Bechuanaland where he was accepted as a vassal of the Batswana chief Sekgoma.

On 2 October, Trotha issued a warning to the Herero:
He further gave orders that:

Trotha gave orders that captured Herero males were to be executed, while women and children were to be driven into the desert where their death from starvation and thirst was to be certain; Trotha argued that there was no need to make exceptions for Herero women and children, since these would &quot;infect German troops with their diseases&quot;, the insurrection Trotha explained &quot;is and remains the beginning of a racial struggle&quot;. After the war, Trotha argued that his orders were necessary, writing in 1909 that &quot;If I had made the small water holes accessible to the womenfolk, I would run the risk of an African catastrophe comparable to the Battle of Beresonia.&quot;

The German general staff was aware of the atrocities that were taking place; its official publication, named &quot;Der Kampf&quot;, noted that:
Alfred von Schlieffen (Chief of the Imperial German General Staff) approved of Trotha&#x27;s intentions in terms of a &quot;racial struggle&quot; and the need to &quot;wipe out the entire nation or to drive them out of the country&quot;, but had doubts about his strategy, preferring their surrender.

Governor Leutwein, later relieved of his duties, complained to Chancellor von Bülow about Trotha&#x27;s actions, seeing the general&#x27;s orders as intruding upon the civilian colonial jurisdiction and ruining any chance of a political settlement. According to Professor Mahmood Mamdani from Columbia University, opposition to the policy of annihilation was largely the consequence of the fact that colonial officials looked at the Herero people as a potential source of labour, and thus economically important. For instance, Governor Leutwein wrote that:
Having no authority over the military, Chancellor Bülow could only advise Emperor Wilhelm II that Trotha&#x27;s actions were &quot;contrary to Christian and humanitarian principle, economically devastating and damaging to Germany&#x27;s international reputation&quot;.

Upon the arrival of new orders at the end of 1904, prisoners were herded into labor camps, where they were given to private companies as slave labourers or exploited as human guinea pigs in medical experiments.

=== Concentration camps ===

Survivors of the massacre, the majority of whom were women and children, were eventually put in places like Shark Island concentration camp, where the German authorities forced them to work as slave labour for German military and settlers. All prisoners were categorised into groups fit and unfit for work, and pre-printed death certificates indicating &quot;death by exhaustion following privation&quot; were issued. The British government published their well-known account of the German genocide of the Nama and Herero peoples in 1918.

Many Herero and Nama died of disease, exhaustion, starvation and malnutrition. Estimates of the mortality rate at the camps are between 45% and 74%.

Food in the camps was extremely scarce, consisting of rice with no additions. As the prisoners lacked pots and the rice they received was uncooked, it was indigestible; horses and oxen that died in the camp were later distributed to the inmates as food. Dysentery and lung diseases were common. Despite those conditions, the prisoners were taken outside the camp every day for labour under harsh treatment by the German guards, while the sick were left without any medical assistance or nursing care. Many Herero and Nama were worked to death.

Shootings, hangings, beatings, and other harsh treatment of the forced labourers (including use of sjamboks) were common. A 28 September 1905 article in the South African newspaper &quot;Cape Argus&quot; detailed some of the abuse with the heading: &quot;In German S. W. Africa: Further Startling Allegations: Horrible Cruelty&quot;. In an interview with Percival Griffith, &quot;an accountant of profession, who owing to hard times, took up on transport work at Angra Pequena, Lüderitz&quot;, related his experiences:
During the war, a number of people from the Cape (in modern-day South Africa) sought employment as transport riders for German troops in Namibia. Upon their return to the Cape, some of these people recounted their stories, including those of the imprisonment and genocide of the Herero and Nama people. Fred Cornell, an aspiring British diamond prospector, was in Lüderitz when the Shark Island concentration camp was being used. Cornell wrote of the camp:
Shark Island was the most brutal of the German South West African camps. Lüderitz lies in southern Namibia, flanked by desert and ocean. In the harbour lies Shark Island, which then was connected to the mainland only by a small causeway. The island is now, as it was then, barren and characterised by solid rock carved into surreal formations by the hard ocean winds. The camp was placed on the far end of the relatively small island, where the prisoners would have suffered complete exposure to the strong winds that sweep Lüderitz for most of the year.

German Commander Ludwig von Estorff wrote in a report that approximately 1,700 prisoners (including 1,203 Nama) had died by April 1907. In December 1906, four months after their arrival, 291 Nama died (a rate of more than nine people per day). Missionary reports put the death rate at 12–18 per day; as many as 80% of the prisoners sent to Shark Island eventually died there.

There are accusations of Herero women being coerced into sex slavery as a means of survival.

Trotha was opposed to contact between natives and settlers, believing that the insurrection was &quot;the beginning of a racial struggle&quot; and fearing that the colonists would be infected by native diseases.

Benjamin Madley argues that although Shark Island is referred to as a concentration camp, it functioned as an extermination camp or death camp.

=== Medical experiments and scientific racism ===

Prisoners were used for medical experiments and their illnesses or their recoveries from them were used for research.

Experiments on live prisoners were performed by Dr. Bofinger, who injected Herero who were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium; afterwards he researched the effects of these substances via autopsy.

Experimentation with the dead body parts of the prisoners was rife. Zoologist (1872–1955) noted taking &quot;body parts from fresh native corpses&quot; which according to him was a &quot;welcome addition&quot;, and he also noted that he could use prisoners for that purpose.

An estimated 300 skulls were sent to Germany for experimentation, in part from concentration camp prisoners. In October 2011, after three years of talks, the first 20 of an estimated 300 skulls stored in the museum of the Charité were returned to Namibia for burial. In 2014, 14 additional skulls were repatriated by the University of Freiburg.

=== Number of victims ===
A census conducted in 1905 revealed that 25,000 Herero remained in German South West Africa.

According to the Whitaker Report, the population of 80,000 Herero was reduced to 15,000 &quot;starving refugees&quot; between 1904 and 1907. In &quot;Colonial Genocide and Reparations Claims in the 21st Century&quot;: &quot;The Socio-Legal Context of Claims under International Law by the Herero against Germany for Genocide in Namibia&quot; by Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes, a number of 100,000 victims is given. Up to 80% of the indigenous populations were killed.

Newspapers reported 65,000 victims when announcing that Germany recognized the genocide in 2004.

== Aftermath ==
With the closure of concentration camps, all surviving Herero were distributed as labourers for settlers in the German colony. From that time on, all Herero over the age of seven were forced to wear a metal disc with their labour registration number, and banned from owning land or cattle, a necessity for pastoral society.

About 19,000 German troops were engaged in the conflict, of which 3,000 saw combat. The rest were used for upkeep and administration. The German losses were 676 soldiers killed in combat, 76 missing, and 689 dead from disease. The Reiterdenkmal () in Windhoek was erected in 1912 to celebrate the victory and to remember the fallen German soldiers and civilians. Until after Independence, no monument was built to the killed indigenous population. It remains a bone of contention in independent Namibia.

The campaign cost Germany 600 million marks. The normal annual subsidy to the colony was 14.5 million marks. In 1908, diamonds were discovered in the territory, and this did much to boost its prosperity, though it was short-lived.

In 1915, during World War I, the German colony was taken over and occupied by the Union of South Africa, which was victorious in the South West Africa campaign. South Africa received a League of Nations mandate over South West Africa on 17 December 1920.

=== Link between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust ===
The Herero genocide has commanded the attention of historians who study complex issues of continuity between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust. It is argued that the Herero genocide set a precedent in Imperial Germany that would later be followed by Nazi Germany&#x27;s establishment of death camps.

According to Benjamin Madley, the German experience in South West Africa was a crucial precursor to Nazi colonialism and genocide. He argues that personal connections, literature, and public debates served as conduits for communicating colonialist and genocidal ideas and methods from the colony to Germany. Tony Barta, an honorary research associate at La Trobe University, argues that the Herero genocide was an inspiration for Hitler in his war against the Jews, Slavs, Romani, and others whom he described as &quot;non-Aryans&quot;.

According to Clarence Lusane, Eugen Fischer&#x27;s medical experiments can be seen as a testing ground for medical procedures which were later followed during the Nazi Holocaust. Fischer later became chancellor of the University of Berlin, where he taught medicine to Nazi physicians. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer was a student of Fischer, Verschuer himself had a prominent pupil, Josef Mengele. Franz Ritter von Epp, who was later responsible for the liquidation of virtually all Bavarian Jews and Roma as governor of Bavaria, took part in the Herero and Nama genocide as well. Historians Robert Gerwarth and Stephan Malinowski have criticized this claim, asserting that Von Epp exercised no influence in Nazi extermination policies.

Mahmood Mamdani argues that the links between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust are beyond the execution of an annihilation policy and the establishment of concentration camps and there are also ideological similarities in the conduct of both genocides. Focusing on a written statement by General Trotha which is translated as: 

Mamdani takes note of the similarity between the aims of the General and the Nazis. According to Mamdani, in both cases there was a Social Darwinist notion of &quot;cleansing&quot;, after which &quot;something new&quot; would &quot;emerge&quot;.

Robert Gerwarth and Stephan Malinowski have questioned the supposed link with the Holocaust, finding it to be lacking in empirical evidence, and argue that Nazi policy represented a distinct turn away from typical European colonial practice. Additionally, they write that studies supporting the link completely ignore the influences of World War I, the German Revolution, and the activities of the Freikorps in the inurement of extreme violence as a method in the German political consciousness. 

Patrick Bernhard writes that the Nazis, including Heinrich Himmler, explicitly rejected the colonial experience of the German Empire as an &quot;appallingly outdated&quot; model; when they did draw inspiration from colonialism for Generalplan Ost, it was from the contemporary work of Italian fascists such as Giuseppe Tassinari in Libya, which they viewed as a shining example of fascist modernity.

== Reconciliation ==
=== Recognition ===
In 1985, the United Nations&#x27; Whitaker Report classified the massacres as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest cases of genocide in the 20th century.

In 1998, German President Roman Herzog visited Namibia and met Herero leaders. Chief Munjuku Nguvauva demanded a public apology and compensation. Herzog expressed regret but stopped short of an apology. He pointed out that international law requiring reparation did not exist in 1907, but he undertook to take the Herero petition back to the German government.

On 16 August 2004, at the 100th anniversary of the start of the genocide, a member of the German government, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany&#x27;s Federal Minister for Economic Development and Cooperation, officially apologised and expressed grief about the genocide, declaring in a speech that:
She ruled out paying special compensations, but promised continued economic aid for Namibia which in 2004 amounted to $14M a year. This number has been significantly increased since then, with the budget for the years 2016–17 allocating a sum total of €138M in monetary support payments.

The Trotha family travelled to Omaruru in October 2007 by invitation of the royal Herero chiefs and publicly apologised for the actions of their relative. Wolf-Thilo von Trotha said:
=== Negotiations and agreement ===
The Herero filed a lawsuit in the United States in 2001 demanding reparations from the German government and Deutsche Bank, which financed the German government and companies in Southern Africa. With a complaint filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 2017, descendants of the Herero and Nama people sued Germany for damages in the United States. The plaintiffs sued under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 U.S. law often invoked in human rights cases. Their proposed class-action lawsuit sought unspecified sums for thousands of descendants of the victims, for the &quot;incalculable damages&quot; that were caused. Germany seeks to rely on its state immunity as implemented in US law as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, arguing that, as a sovereign nation, it cannot be sued in US courts in relation to its acts outside the United States. In March 2019, the judge dismissed the claims due to the exceptions to sovereign immunity being too narrow for the case.

In September 2020, the Second Circuit stated that the claimants did not prove that money used to buy property in New York could be traced back to wealth resulting from the seized property and therefore the lawsuit could not overcome Germany&#x27;s immunity. In June 2021, the Supreme Court declined to hear a petition to revive the case.

Germany, while admitting brutality in Namibia, at first refused to call it a &quot;genocide&quot;, claiming that the term only became international law in 1945. However, in July 2015, then foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier issued a political guideline stating that the massacre should be referred to as a &quot;war crime and a genocide&quot;. Bundestag president Norbert Lammert wrote an article in &quot;Die Zeit&quot; that same month referring to the events as a genocide. These events paved the way for negotiations with Namibia.

In 2015, the German government began negotiations with Namibia over a possible apology, and by 2016, Germany committed itself to apologizing for the genocide, as well as to refer to the event as a genocide; but the actual declaration was postponed while negotiations stalled over questions of compensation.

On 11 August 2020, following negotiations over a potential compensation agreement between Germany and Namibia, President Hage Geingob of Namibia stated that the German government&#x27;s offer was &quot;not acceptable&quot;, while German envoy Ruprecht Polenz said he was &quot;still optimistic that a solution can be found.&quot;

On 28 May 2021, the German government announced that it was formally recognizing the atrocities committed as a genocide, following five years of negotiations. The declaration was made by foreign minister Heiko Maas, who also stated that Germany was asking Namibia and the descendants of the genocide victims for forgiveness. In addition to recognizing the events as a genocide, Germany agreed to give as a &quot;gesture of recognition of the immeasurable suffering&quot; €1.1 billion in aid to the communities impacted by the genocide.

Following the announcement, the agreement needs to be ratified by both countries&#x27; parliaments, after which Germany would send its president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to officially apologize for the genocide. The nations agreed not to use the term &quot;reparation&quot; to describe the financial aid package.

The agreement was criticized by the chairman of the Namibian Genocide Association, Laidlaw Peringanda, who insisted that Germany should purchase their ancestral lands back from the descendants of the German settlers and return it to the Herero and Nama people. The agreement was also criticized because negotiations were held solely between the German and Namibian governments, and did not include representatives of the Herero and Nama people.

Further criticism of the agreement came in 2024 with the filing of the South Africa v. Israel case at the International Court of Justice. After President Geingob criticized Germany&#x27;s decision to back Israel in the case, Nandi Mazeingo of the Ovaherero Genocide Foundation called on Namibia to go further, saying &quot;What South Africa did for Palestine is what Namibia must do for us as Hereros and Namas. They must go to that ICJ also, for us.&quot;

=== Repatriation ===
Peter Katjavivi, a former Namibian ambassador to Germany, demanded in August 2008 that the skulls of Herero and Nama prisoners of the 1904–1908 uprising, which were taken to Germany for scientific research to claim the superiority of white Europeans over Africans, be returned to Namibia. Katjavivi was reacting to a German television documentary which reported that its investigators had found more than 40 of these skulls at two German universities, among them probably the skull of a Nama chief who had died on Shark Island near Lüderitz. In September 2011, the skulls were returned to Namibia. In August 2018, Germany returned all of the remaining skulls and other human remains which were examined in Germany to scientifically promote white supremacy. This was the third such transfer, and shortly before it occurred, German Protestant bishop Petra Bosse-Huber stated &quot;Today, we want to do what should have been done many years ago – to give back to their descendents the remains of people who became victims of the first genocide of the 20th century.&quot;

On 17 May 2019, as a part of the repatriation process, the German government announced that it would return a stone symbol which it took from Namibia in the 1900s.

== Media ==
* A BBC documentary, &quot;Namibia – Genocide and the Second Reich&quot; (2005), explores the Herero and Nama genocide and the circumstances surrounding it.
* In the documentary &quot;100 Years of Silence&quot;, filmmakers Halfdan Muurholm and Casper Erichsen portray a 23-year-old Herero woman, who is aware of the fact that her great-grandmother was raped by a German soldier. The documentary explores the past and the way Namibia deals with it now.
* &quot;Mama Namibia&quot;, a historical novel by Mari Serebrov, provides two perspectives of the 1904 genocide in German South West Africa. The first is that of Jahohora, a 12-year-old Herero girl who survives on her own in the veld for two years after her family is killed by German soldiers. The second story in &quot;Mama Namibia&quot; is that of Kov, a Jewish doctor who volunteered to serve in the German military to prove his patriotism. As he witnesses the atrocities of the genocide, he rethinks his loyalty to the Fatherland.
* Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;V.&quot; (1963) has a chapter that includes recollections of the genocide; there are memories of events that took place in 1904 in various locations, including the Shark Island concentration camp.
* Jackie Sibblies Drury&#x27;s play, &quot;We Are Proud To Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Südwestafrika, Between the Years 1884–1915&quot;, is about a group of actors developing a play about the Herero and Nama genocide.

<text>The Emmental (, ) is a valley in west-central Switzerland, forming part of the canton of Bern. It is a hilly landscape comprising the basins of the rivers Emme and Ilfis. The region is mostly devoted to farming, particularly dairy farming. The principal settlements are the town of Burgdorf and the village of Langnau.

Comprising Burgdorf, Trachselwald, and Signau districts in the canton of Bern, the Emmental became part of the Emmental-Oberaargau administrative region on 1 January 2010. The district of Fraubrunnen is divided between Emmental and Bern-Mittelland.

==Geography==

The region comprises relatively low mountains on the right bank of the Aare. It includes the basins of the Emme and the Ilfis between Burgdorf and the boundary with the canton of Solothurn. Its principal elevation is the Napf, a mountain massif dominating the northwestern part of the Emmental Alps.

The landscape is dominated by meadows and pastureland, with forest interspersed.

==Economy==
The original Emmental cheese is produced there, and the dairy industry still dominates the local economy. Pottery from the region is also prized, and the ceramics of the region have endured practically unchanged since the 17th century.

Tourism has had less impact on the region than on other parts of Switzerland.

==Culture==
The novelist Jeremias Gotthelf (1797–1854) was a pastor in the Emmental and wrote about the region.

The Emmental also played a dominant role in the history of the Mennonites.

===Architecture===
The typical Emmental farmhouse has a steep roof with a large overhang that almost reaches the ground.

<text>Antonio Rafael Barceló y Martínez (April 15, 1868 – December 15, 1938) was a Puerto Rican lawyer, businessman and the patriarch of what was to become one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s most prominent political families. Barceló, who in 1917 became the first President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, played an instrumental role in the introduction and passage of legislation which permitted the realization of the School of Tropical Medicine and the construction of a Capitol building in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Barceló was born in the City of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to Jaime José Barceló Miralles (son of Antonio and Catalina) and Josefa Martínez de León (b. 1842). His father Jaime had emigrated from Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain to Puerto Rico where he married Josefa (b. Naguabo, Puerto Rico) in Fajardo. He became an orphan by the age of three; his father had died in 1870 and his mother in 1871. He went to live with his aunt, Carmela de Leon, and his grandmother Belen de Leon, both of whom raised him. As a youngster, Barceló took an active interest in politics.

He studied in the &quot;Concillier Seminary&quot; of San Juan. In 1928 he earned a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School. He joined the &quot;Autonomist Party&quot; (founded by José de Diego and Román Baldorioty de Castro in 1887) and soon became the party&#x27;s secretary. In 1897, he was appointed as a municipal judge of Fajardo. The United States allowed him to retain the position after its invasion during the Spanish–American War. On February 4, 1899, Barceló married Maria Georgina &quot;Josefina&quot; Bird Arias, a daughter of the sugar baron Jorge Bird León.

==Political career==

===Union Party of Puerto Rico===
Barceló left the Autonomist Party and together with Luis Muñoz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Eduardo Georgetti, Juan Vias Ochoteco, José de Diego, and others, founded the &quot;Union party&quot;. The party, which believed in Puerto Rican independence, was led by Muñoz Rivera as president, with Barceló as the secretary general. The party won the election in 1904 and Muñoz Rivera was selected as a member of the House of Delegates, while Barceló was elected to the Chamber of Delegates in 1905.

In 1910, Barceló founded the Association of Puerto Rico, with the idea of protecting the main industries of the island, which at that time were coffee, tobacco and sugar, against imported brands. The legislature of Puerto Rico passed law number 52 in 1913, which officially established the Association of Puerto Rico and renamed it the Association of Products made in Puerto Rico. The law also incorporated and protected the official logo of the association, which contains the phrase &quot;Hecho en Puerto Rico&quot; (Made in Puerto Rico).

In 1914, Barceló, Muñoz Rivera and de Diego were members of an executive council that tried to form an alliance between the Union and Republican Parties. In 1917, after Luis Muñoz Rivera died, Barceló became the leading force behind the liberal ideas of the island. He looked after Luis Muñoz Marín, Muñoz Rivera&#x27;s son, and continued the publication of &quot;La Democracia&quot;, the political newspaper founded by Muñoz Rivera.

From 1917 to 1932, he was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico, and was named president of the Puerto Rican Senate. Barceló opposed the Jones-Shafroth Act, which granted United States citizenship to residents of Puerto Rico, because he thought it might interfere with gaining independence. Also, the judicial and executive branches would still be controlled by the United States. The Jones-Shafroth Act was approved by the United States and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917. The Union Party under Barceló&#x27;s leadership resolved to adopt a different stance and to seek more autonomy, which he believed would finally lead to independence. This shift prompted de Diego, who was a strong independence advocate, to depart from the party.

In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Emmet Montgomery Reily, who was a strong supporter of &quot;Americanism&quot;, as Governor of Puerto Rico. During his inauguration address, he insisted that the United States flag (&quot;Old Glory&quot;) should be the only flag used over the island and denounced those who believed in Puerto Rican independence as anti-American and traitors. Additionally, he placed several mainland politicians in prominent positions in the Puerto Rican government. Reily was an extremely unpopular governor, he was the subject of corruption allegations and an investigation by Puerto Rican local officials. Under pressure, Reily resigned as governor in 1923.

As Reily had convinced the American public that the independence advocates were enemies of the U.S., Barceló and his party opted for the creation of &quot;El Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (a Free Associated State), asking for more autonomy in Puerto Rico instead of independence. He received the support of U.S. Representative Phillip Campbell, who introduced a bill to the United States Congress to such respect. It also included provisions for Puerto Ricans to elect their own governor. The Campbell Bill did not pass Congress, however. This led to the departure of José Coll y Cuchí from the party and his founding of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

As president of the Senate, Barceló supported legislation to give Governor Horace Towner and his cabinet, the economic resources to create the School of Tropical Medicine, the Capitol building, the state penitentiary and healthy quarters for workers (said quarters became known as &quot;Barrio Obrero&quot;). He played an instrumental role in what resulted in the construction of buildings for the University of Puerto Rico and the development of an excellent native faculty.

In 1922, presiding Chief Justice of the United States, William Howard Taft made the following statement in regard to the :&quot;Balzac v. Porto Rico&quot; case: &quot;Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, but is not part of the United States. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and even though Puerto Ricans have American citizenship, they do not have the same rights as the common American citizen&quot;.

Both Barceló and Jose Tous Soto, the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, understood by Taft&#x27;s statement that neither independence nor statehood would be considered for the time being. In 1924, they formed an &quot;Alliance&quot; between their political parties to concentrate on improving Puerto Rico&#x27;s economic situation. The party was called Alianza Puertorriqueña (or &quot;Puerto Rican Alliance&quot;). All this led to some differences in ideals between Eduardo Georgetti and Barceló. Georgetti believed in the original ideal of the Union Party and that the &quot;Alliance&quot; coalition would not work because of their ideological differences. Barceló and a group of party delegates traveled to Washington to seek changes in the Jones Act of 1917, by presenting their views that the economic situation in Puerto Rico was a good one and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. Georgetti traveled to Washington, D.C., in representation of various Puerto Rican organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the &quot;Fuerzas Vivas&quot; (Live Forces). Georgetti and the &quot;Fuerzas Vivas&quot; presented the Secretary of War a &quot;Memorandum&quot; which presented the economic situation of the island in the brink of ruins. His actions were viewed by Barceló and the &quot;Alliance&quot; as an attempt by Georgetti and the &quot;Fuerzas Vivas&quot; to discredit him and weaken the &quot;Alliance&quot;. Georgetti denied it and quit the alliance. Barceló was also a victim of an assassination attempt, but this did not keep him from believing and pursuing his liberal ideas.

===Liberal Party of Puerto Rico===
Differences became apparent between Barceló and Tous Soto and Félix Córdova Dávila, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, as to the goals of the alliance. Barceló requested that Herbert Hoover, the newly elected President of the United States, retain Horace Towner temporarily as governor of the island. Hoover, however, consulted Córdova Dávila, instead of Barceló, in regard to his intentions of naming Theodore Roosevelt Jr. to the position. Córdova Dávila in turn notified Tous Soto, instead of Barceló, as to Hoover&#x27;s decision.

Barceló felt offended that he was not consulted and convinced his followers, in the Unionist sector of the alliance, to disaffiliate themselves from the &quot;Alliance.&quot; Because of legal reasons Barceló was unable to use the name &quot;Union Party.&quot; In 1932, he founded the &quot;Puerto Rican Liberal Party.&quot; The Liberal Party&#x27;s political agenda was the same as that of the original Union Party, urging independence as a final political solution for Puerto Rico. Among those who joined him in the &quot;new&quot; party were Felisa Rincón de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini. By 1932, Barceló had invited Luis Muñoz Marín, son of Luis Muñoz Rivera, to join the Liberal Party. During the elections of 1932, the Liberal Party faced the Alliance, by then a coalition of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and Santiago Iglesias Pantin&#x27;s Socialist Party.

Barceló and Muñoz Marín were both elected senators of Puerto Rico. Even though the Liberal Party received more votes than the Republican Party and the Socialist Party did individually, it received fewer votes than their candidates as a coalition. Eventually, Muñoz Marín, who had different points of view as to how Puerto Rico should go about obtaining its independence, would collide with Barceló. Barceló believed that independence should be a gradual process, preceded by autonomous insular government.

Following the Río Piedras massacre in 1935, US Senator Millard Tydings in 1936 introduced a bill in Congress for Puerto Rican independence. The Puerto Rican parties supported the bill, but Muñoz Marín opposed it, saying it had unfavorable economic aspects. Tydings did not gain passage of the bill.

In 1936, a Liberal Party assembly was held in San Juan. Muñoz Marín said he was not interested in being considered for the position of Resident Commissioner and recommended Barceló. This move would leave the presidency of the party open for Muñoz Marín. Barceló refused to be named commissioner and to relinquish his presidency. Muñoz Marín and his followers founded a group within the party called &quot;Accion Social Puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican Social Action), who believed in gaining the immediate independence of Puerto Rico.

After the Liberal Party was defeated in 1936 elections, its leaders held an assembly in Naranjales on May 31, 1937. Muñoz Marín presented his ideas as to how the party should be run. The majority of the party members objected and blamed him for their defeat, as well as criticizing his opposition of the bill for independence. Muñoz Marín considered this action the same as having been expelled from the party.

Muñoz Marín and his followers, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo and founded the &quot;Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo&quot; (&quot;Clear, Authentic and Complete Liberal Party&quot;), claiming to be the true Liberal Party. The Partido Liberal, Neto, Auténtico y Completo, an independence political party, later became the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). It promoted the political status of an &quot;Estado Libre Associado&quot; (Free Associated State) status which Barceló, as president of the Union Party, had asked for in 1923. Muñoz Marín had formerly opposed this.

==Later years==
Antonio R. Barceló died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on October 15, 1938. With his passing, his daughter Maria Antonia Josefina, was elected president of the Liberal Party, thus becoming the first woman to preside a political party in Puerto Rico. The party ceased to exist in 1948. Ironically, his grandson Carlos Romero Barceló (Maria Antonia Josefina&#x27;s son) on January 2, 1977, was sworn in as Governor of Puerto Rico with a pro-statehood agenda, a political status which Antonio R. Barceló had opposed, as member of the Partido Nuevo Progresista de Puerto Rico (New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico).

==Legacy==
Barceló was responsible for the approval of many laws which led to reforms and that would greatly benefit the social justice, labor and the Puerto Rican economy. Barceló helped to establish the minimum wage rate, workers&#x27; compensation and limited working hours. Barceló, also played a principal role in the establishment of &quot;The School of Tropical Medicine&quot;, &quot;The Federal Penitentiary&quot;, &quot;The Antituberculosis Sanctuary&quot; and numerous other centers. He introduced the proper legislation which permitted the construction of the Puerto Rico State Capitol. During his tenure as president of the Puerto Rico Senate. In 1928, Columbia University of New York, honored Barceló by bestowing upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Law.

His memory has been honored by Puerto Rico by naming public buildings and schools after him, including the Antonio R. Barceló Legislative Building which previously housed the School of Tropical Medicine and the Department of Natural Resources. His philosophy remains relevant nearly a century later, as evidenced by references to it in contemporary political and journalistic commentary.

<doc id="858016" wikidata="Q968900" url="?curid=858016" title="Princess Ai">
<text>is a manga series created and co-written by American musician and singer Courtney Love and Stuart Levy, with illustration by Ai Yazawa and Misaho Kujiradou. Based in part on Love&#x27;s own life, the manga follows an amnesiac alien character, Ai, who is transported to Tokyo from her war-torn homeland, where she attempts to piece her life together.

Co-written by Love and Levy, the manga was initially featured in Japan in Shinshokan&#x27;s &quot;Wings&quot; magazine, and later published in English by Tokyopop in three volumes between 2004 and 2006. A sequel, &quot;Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn&quot;, was later published in two volumes in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and was written by Christine Boylan and Levy. Tokyopop re-released the original &quot;Princess Ai&quot; series in one volume, &quot;Princess Ai: The Ultimate Edition&quot; on October 9, 2007.

Additionally, comic strips, art books, coloring books, fan books, and action figures based on the series and its characters have been released.

==Plot==
A young, amnesiac alien girl known only as Princess Ai is mysteriously transported to Tokyo, Japan from her war-torn home, Ai-Land, which is in the midst of a revolution. With only a heart-shaped box to clue her in on her past, Ai makes her living as a rock star at Club Cupid. She falls in love with a sensitive musician, Kent, much to the distaste of Kent&#x27;s gay, possessive roommate, Hikaru. The plot complicates as talent agents of the H.T.A and demons seeking to take control of Ai&#x27;s homeland, Ai-Land, pursue her for their own ends. 

==Characters==
===Primary characters===

==== Princess Ai ====

: Princess Ai is the main character of the story. She is the product of a relationship between a human father, King Sei, and a Dougen (Angel) mother. Because of the war that rages between the Humans and the Dougen in Ai-Land, Ai&#x27;s true parentage was kept a secret, even from Ai herself. Due to her mixed heritage, Ai sprouted wings on her back, tinged with red, and has the ability to control people&#x27;s emotions with her singing. Ai loves Nora and Kent, and she is torn between the two. She is fiercely independent. She likes to wear torn clothes, and is known to cut her clothes to match this preference. Her heart-shaped box she always keeps with her is made of pure tenketsu, the blood of angels, the primary source of energy throughout Ai-Land. Tenketsu is fatal to humans; If Dougen touch it, they receive a narcotic reaction.

==== Kent ====

: Kent is a young man who works at the Shinjuku University library part-time. Kent is one of the first people to discover Ai after she appeared in Tokyo, and offers her a place to stay, causing trouble with his roommate, Hikaru. Like Ai, he is of a mixed heritage, being half-Japanese and half-American, which he draws on to help Ai come to grips with her dual heritage in chapter 11.

===Secondary characters===

==== Fa&#x27;an ====

: He is a street musician with strangely compelling lyrics who helps Ai discover her flair for singing. He has a knack for appearing and disappearing at just the right time. He watches out for Ai, and is associated with the fallen (Princess Ai: Prism of Midnight Dawn). He is a mysterious person who knows of Ai&#x27;s past. 

==== Daisuke ====

: He is Kent&#x27;s coworker at the Shinjuku University library. Kent continually thwarts his efforts to ask Ai out.

==== Hikaru ====

: He is Kent&#x27;s roommate. Hikaru has a huge crush on Kent and a hatred for Ai, fueled by jealousy. Later on in the series, he makes peace with Ai and becomes one of her biggest supporters (volume 3, chapter 11).
* Yoshi - Ai&#x27;s personal assistant seen in volume 2. He is sometimes mistaken for a very tall woman.
* Lissa - She is Ai&#x27;s tutor back in Ai-Land. She was Ai&#x27;s best friend but Ai kept her wings a secret from her. From a flashback in chapter 12, Lissa told Ai that Queen Lilith wasn&#x27;t her real mother.
* Shinji - The manager of Club Cupid. He lets Ai sing at Club Cupid.
* Jen - The one singer at Club Cupid who takes the time to befriend Ai. Later on in the story, Jen dies getting Ai&#x27;s heart-shaped box back from a robber.
* Nora - A leader of the revolutionaries in Ai-Land, this Angel wants equality—not superiority—over humans, but not everyone shares his views. He got really close to Ai and sent her to Earth for her safety. He didn&#x27;t know that Ai was one of them but knew that Ai is someone who will change the world.

=== Antagonists ===

==== Takeshi ====

: A VIP at the nightclub Club Cupid who works for H.T.A., an infamous Japanese talent agency. He is ordered by Hayabusa to eliminate Ai during her worldwide stadium tour. (chapter 14)

==== Hayabusa ====

: Takeshi&#x27;s boss, the president of H.T.A. (Hayabusa Talent Agency), who is allegedly connected with the yakuza. He plans to use Ai&#x27;s talent for his own success.

==== Hiro ====

: Ai&#x27;s manager at H.T.A. He is ordered by Hayabusa to keep Ai under control. He tries to kill Ai during a blackout in chapter 15 but her true powers came to light. He got arrested for shooting the gun at Ai.

==== Kaz ====

: Nora&#x27;s radical cousin who believes that the human royal family must be conquered at all costs. Much to Nora&#x27;s dismay, Kaz dispatched Tess to capture Ai. But later on, he discovers the truth about Ai and understands Nora&#x27;s point (chapter 15).
* Kemo - He is only seen in &quot;Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn&quot;. He is one of the angels who helped with the second revolution, and is in league with Kaz. However, he now harbours a personal revenge against Ai, and is on the brink of insanity
* Tess - One of the 3 Furies of Ai-Land, she was sent to search out and drag Ai back to her planet. After a radical change of heart, she becomes Ai&#x27;s protector (chapter 10). She understands that Ai is the key for peace in Ai-Land and Nora&#x27;s plan is the right one. She has a dragon on each of her red wings which spews out fire. They are weak to liquid.
* Meggi - The second Furie sister to be sent out to fetch Ai in chapter 11. She is Tess&#x27;s younger sister. She is devoted to Kaz and is weak to flowers. She uses jealousy and vengeance to manipulate her enemies. She has snakes on each of her wings.
* Alexa - She is third Furie Sisters to be sent out in chapter 13. She is Tess&#x27;s and Meggi&#x27;s sister, and Kaz&#x27;s last hope to return Ai to Ai-Land. She has the power to freeze time. It is suspected that she has a crush on Takeshi.

==Development and Production==
&quot;Princess Ai&quot; is a loose adaptation of Courtney Love&#x27;s life story, with Ai functioning as Love&#x27;s fantasy alter ego. In a 2003 interview concerning the series, Love stated: &quot;I have always loved the Japanese culture and people. Princess Ai is a great character, because she feels like my alter ego, but in a fantasy setting.&quot; The word &quot;Ai&quot; means &quot;love&quot; in Japanese. It is also generally believed that Kent, the sensitive, blonde guitar player who becomes Ai&#x27;s love interest, is based on Courtney Love&#x27;s late husband, Kurt Cobain.

Co-created and co-written by Love and D.J. Milky, the initial run of &quot;Princess Ai&quot; was written and illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and featured character designs by Ai Yazawa. According to Nielsen BookScan sales reports, &quot;Princess Ai&quot; topped the Adult Fiction Overall Trade Paper Graphic Novels list for the week ending July 25, 2004. &quot;Princess Ai&quot; was published in three volumes from July 6, 2004, to February 7, 2006.Madman Entertainment released &quot;Princess Ai&quot; in New Zealand and Australia. The series is also licensed in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in France by Soleil Manga, in Italy by J-Pop, in Finland by Punainen jättiläinen, and in Russia by Comix-ART.

The sequel, &quot;Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn&quot;, was published by Tokyopop in two volumes in December 2008 and December 2009. It is also licensed in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in France by Soleil Manga, and in Italy by J-Pop.

Volume 3 of &quot;Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn&quot; was planned to be released on March 1, 2011, but, as of 2019, remains unreleased.

<text>Ricardo Elizondo Elizondo (January 26, 1950, Monterrey – August 24, 2013, Monterrey) was a writer, playwright, historian and archivist, whose work concentrated on preserving and promoting the culture of northeastern Mexico. Several of his books won awards and other recognitions in Mexico and abroad.

== Life ==
Elizondo was the fourth of six children of Aurora Elizondo of Huinalá and Guadalupe Elizondo of Monterrey proper. Elizondo&#x27;s father was a worker and union leader at the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. His mother had served as an arbiter in water disputes in her town.

Elizondo&#x27;s interest in words and stories both fiction and non-fiction began when he was a child. His great grandparents on his mother&#x27;s side told him many stories of the area, including battles against the indigenous of the area that were still ongoing at the end of the 19th century. This experience formed the basis of his literary development. He began writing stories in his free time since the sixth grade, when he decided he wanted to be a writer. He also began a project of the vocabulary and speech of his region&#x27;s Spanish, which would eventually become the book &quot;Lexicon del Noreste&quot;. Another major influence on his writing was the death of his sister, who was run over by a car when she was seven. The loss shook the family, especially Elizondo, making him more sensible to death, according to his brother Carlos.

Although he knew he wanted to be a writer, his family was practical. He attended the Colegio Civil and then went on to study public accounting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, graduating in 1975. He did study humanities for a time at UNAM, but he did not finish this degree. Later in life, he would earn a masters in humanities from Universidad de Monterrey and a doctorate in history from the Iberoamericana University.

Elizondo retired from his administrative career, but wrote until his death of cancer, which he battled unsuccessfully for two years.

== Career ==
Elizondo wrote novels, short stories, plays, works on history and biographies. He first started published short stories about Huinalá and other communities in newspapers when he was seventeen. In the mid-1970s, he was working as an accountant with the Bank of Mexico, when he met writer Juan José Arreola at a café in Mexico City. He presented some of his short stories to the writer, who had a reputation for supporting young talent, who pronounced Elizondo&#x27;s work “pure silver.” Elizondo wrote for the El Norte and El Porvenir newspapers, wrote biographies of José Vasconcelos and Martín Luis Guzmán along with histories of businesses and institutions.

Elizondo also had an administrative and academic career which spanned over three decades. In 1975, he became the director of the General Archives of the State of Nuevo León, continuing until 1979. In 1980 he became the director of Monterrey Tech&#x27;s special collections, called the Cervantine Library. His career with the institution as head librarian and professor spanned 32 years. He retired from this position two years before his death because of his health.

Elizondo was a member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua, as well as a member of the Mexican committee of the Memory of the World Programme (UNESCO).

== Writing style ==
Elizondo&#x27;s style was costumbrista, chronicling life and change in the towns and cities of his border region. He was one of five authors in the 1980s particularly noted for writing about desert life in northern Mexico, which was named “narrativo del desierto” (desert narrative), along with Daniel Sada of Baja California, Gerardo Cornejo of Sonora, Jesus Gardea of Chihuahua and Serverino Salazar of Zacatecas. His first book was a collection of short stories, Relatos de Mar, Desierto y Muerte (Stories of the Sea, Desert and Death), published in 1980.

Several of his works won prizes and other recognitions. &quot;Ocurrencias de Don Quijote&quot; (1992) received five international awards. &quot;Relatos de mar, desierto y muerte&quot; received the Premio Nacional de Cuento in 1980. &quot;Setenta veces siete&quot; won the Premio Colima from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1987. Books such as &quot;Narcedalia Piedrotas&quot; (1993) and &quot;Setenta veces siete&quot; (1987) can be found on college syllabi.

He had a passion for photography, which he inherited from his father. In addition to taking photographs, he had a large collection of them from the 19th century. His photographic work made its way into books such as &quot;Monterrey, una vision fotográfica&quot;, &quot;Regiomontanos 1900&quot; and &quot;Polvo de aquellos lodos&quot;. In 1999, he wrote a commemorative edition on the Palace of Lecumberri on its 100th anniversary (Lecumberri, ángel y escorpión: galería fotográfica del ultimo día) which documented the conversion of the building from prison to the General Archives of the Nation.

<text>Barbara Gordon is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character was created by television producer William Dozier, editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox, and artist Carmine Infantino. Dozier, the producer of the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series, requested Schwartz to call for a new female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic-book appearance as [[Batgirl]] in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359, titled &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!&quot; in January 1967, by Fox and Infantino, allowing her to be introduced into the television series, portrayed by actress Yvonne Craig, in the season 3 premiere &quot;Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin&quot;, in September that same year.

Barbara Gordon is the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, the sister of serial killer James Gordon Jr. and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in &quot;Batman Family&quot; which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original Robin, Dick Grayson, whom she has a history of working closely and being romantically involved with. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character&#x27;s Batgirl persona in &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1, the graphic novel &quot;&quot; depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a technical advisor, computer expert and information broker known as Oracle. Becoming a valuable asset providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; series. In 2011, as part of DC Comics &quot;The New 52&quot; relaunch, Barbara recovered from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and returned as Batgirl. Barbara has since featured in the eponymous &quot;Batgirl&quot; monthly title as well as &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; and other &quot;Batman&quot; books. Following the events of Joker War, Barbara returned to her Oracle role while recovering from an injury, and continues to operate as both Batgirl and Oracle after the 2021 &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; event.

The character was a popular comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the &quot;Batman&quot; television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, which led to the character&#x27;s paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, have also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors, and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.

As both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. Aside from Craig, the character has been portrayed by Dina Meyer, Alicia Silverstone (as Barbara Wilson), and Jeté Laurence, and has been voiced by Melissa Gilbert, Tara Strong, Danielle Judovits, Alyson Stoner, Mae Whitman, Kimberly Brooks and Briana Cuoco among others. Barbara Gordon appeared in the third season of the HBO Max series &quot;Titans&quot; as the new commissioner of Gotham City portrayed by Savannah Welch. The character was slated for a solo film set in the DCEU, starring Leslie Grace in the title role and intended to be released on HBO Max. The film was canceled in August 2022. In 2011, Barbara Gordon ranked 17th in IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot;.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Batman Family&quot; and other appearances (1967–1988)===

Before the introduction of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character to attract a female viewership to the &quot;Batman&quot; television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City&#x27;s Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating &quot;Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the &#x27;50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her TV show.&quot; Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show&#x27;s third season.

Barbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 (Jan. 1967), &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl&quot;, as the daughter of Gotham City&#x27;s Police Commissioner James Gordon. In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, sporting a black bodysuit with yellow gloves, boots, utility belt, and a bat symbol along with a blue cape and cowl (similar to Batman&#x27;s), Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the supervillain Killer Moth, attracting Batman&#x27;s attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.

In her civilian identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of the Gotham City Public Library, &quot;presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality.&quot; She was given a regular backup slot in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in the publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #417 (1971), stating: &quot;I&#x27;d like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back ...They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman&#x27;s life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman.&quot;

Batgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, as a supporting character in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot;. In the mid-1970s, Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father (who had already discovered it on his own) and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972, appeared in a story entitled &quot;Batgirl&#x27;s Last Case.&quot; Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in &quot;Superman&quot; #268 (1973), in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent, establishing their friendship, and fights alongside Superman. Batgirl and Superman later team up twice more in &quot;Superman&quot; #279 and &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #19.

Batgirl also guest-starred in other Superman-related titles such as &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, and in &quot;Superman Family&quot; #171, where she teams up with Supergirl. The character is given a starring role in DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman Family&quot; comic book which debuted in 1975. The original Robin Dick Grayson became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the &quot;Dynamite Duo: Batgirl &amp; Robin.&quot; Batgirl meets Batwoman in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime-fighting (before Kane is murdered by the Bronze Tiger). The two fight Killer Moth and the Cavalier, and learn each other&#x27;s secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crime-fighting. Although this series ended after three years of publication, Batgirl continued to appear in back-up stories published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; through issue #519 (October 1982).
&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl&#x27;s eulogy in issue #7 of the 12-part series. The conclusion of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon&#x27;s niece/adopted daughter in post-crisis continuity. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #20 &quot;featuring Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite&quot; (1987), Barbara Gordon&#x27;s origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randall. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blueprints of the city, excelling in academics to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.

===&quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1 and &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot; (1988)===
DC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel.

Later that year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; exert a great impact on the character, the story has little to do with her. In 2006, during an interview with &quot;Wizard&quot;, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it &quot;shallow and ill-conceived.&quot; He stated before writing the graphic novel, &quot;I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project&quot;, and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, &quot;Len got back onto the phone and said, &#x27;Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.&#x27;&quot; Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character&#x27;s paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of &quot;Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed&quot; (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; specifically to retire the character and set her in place for &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;.

Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability.

Gail Simone would include the character&#x27;s paralysis in a list of &quot;major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered&quot;, dubbing the phenomenon &quot;Women in Refrigerators&quot; in reference to a 1994 &quot;Green Lantern&quot; story where the title character discovers his girlfriend&#x27;s mutilated body in his refrigerator.

===&quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; and other appearances (1989–2011)===
Yale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon&#x27;s new persona as Oracle for the next several years. The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #23, anonymously offering her services to the government&#x27;s Task Force X. In the following two years, Oracle, under the pen of Ostrander and Yale, made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; #38 (1990) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue #48 following an invitation from Amanda Waller. In 1992, Dennis O&#x27;Neil wrote Oracle as Batman&#x27;s sole source of information in &quot;Batman: Sword of Azrael&quot; #1. This newly forged partnership established Oracle&#x27;s status as Batman&#x27;s intellectual equal. She is subsequently featured in the 12-issue miniseries &quot;The Hacker Files&quot; (1993). In &quot;Oracle: Year One&quot;—a story arc contained in &quot;The Batman Chronicles&quot; #5 (1996)—Yale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon&#x27;s new persona as Oracle. Initially, Gordon&#x27;s paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression. However, she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime.
In a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she possesses a genius-level intellect; photographic memory; deep knowledge of computers and electronics; expert skills as a hacker; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to the Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology) has her face; it is then that she adopts &quot;Oracle&quot; as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations and members of the superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon, one of DC&#x27;s premiere martial artists, to engage in combat (using eskrima) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper-body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs.

The success of Chuck Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey&quot; (1996) led to the comic series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; starring the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon&#x27;s crossover series &quot;Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle&quot;, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first &quot;Batgirl&quot; monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; with issue #56. Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle&#x27;s secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon&#x27;s origin with the miniseries &quot;&quot;. Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.
During the 2004 crossover event &quot;&quot;, Black Mask commandeers Oracle&#x27;s computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman. To prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower&#x27;s self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This destroys Gordon&#x27;s home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn&quot; (2005), and &quot;Birds of Prey: The Battle Within&quot; (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.

During the company-wide crossover &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005), Oracle teams with the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society&#x27;s global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline.

When DC continuity jumps forward one year after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Oracle and her team continue to work in Metropolis. Oracle works with Batman, although not regularly as before. Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey and expands the ranks of the operation. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #99, Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; field leader, while Big Barda is brought in as the group&#x27;s heavy-hitter alongside a larger, rotating roster. Oracle also attempts to reforge her alliance with Power Girl. However, when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team, she replies that she will do so &quot;when Hell freezes over.&quot;

In the crossover event &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; (2007), Oracle dispatches the Question and Batwoman to capture Trickster and Piper following their role in the murder of Bart Allen. She struggles to keep the identities of the world&#x27;s heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the Calculator, a villainous hacker and information broker. In &quot;The All-New Booster Gold&quot; #5 (2007), the title hero is given the mission of traveling back in time in order to prevent &quot;a tragedy that he discovers never should&#x27;ve happened—the Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, Batgirl.&quot; Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;, he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon&#x27;s chronological history remains unchanged. Rip Hunter convinces him that Barbara&#x27;s destiny is to become Oracle. Later, Batman reveals that he kept Joker&#x27;s photos of Barbara and Booster Gold for years and waited until Booster Gold&#x27;s correct age before confronting him. Batman then thanks Booster Gold for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship.

In &quot;Whitewater&quot;, Gail Simone&#x27;s final story arc on &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2007), Oracle and her team struggle for power with Spy Smasher, a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization. Eventually, Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle. After the arc, Oracle also adopts Misfit into the Birds of Prey. Sean McKeever temporarily took over as author of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, writing issues #113–117, &quot;Birds of Prey: Metropolis or Dust&quot; (2008). The following arc of the series &quot;Birds of Prey: Platinum Flats&quot; (2008) is written by Tony Bedard. In the company-wide 2008 &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline, Darkseid—who has finally gained control of the Anti-Life Equation—attempts to put the mind-control equation on the internet. Both Oracle and Mister Terrific make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid, even attempting to shut down the entire Internet. Unfortunately, they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid. Freed from Darkseid&#x27;s control after the restoration of the Multiverse, she attempts to shut down the criminal &quot;Unternet&quot; set up by her opposite number, the Calculator, as a Darkseid-free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech-savvy criminals. However, the Calculator, preventing her moves, takes control of the Kilg%re, gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars, and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers. Even though Oracle foils him, she starts doubting her abilities and fears she&#x27;s losing her edge and brilliance, which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul-searching. &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; received cancellation in early 2009, with the final issue being #127.

Oracle is subsequently featured in &quot;Oracle: The Cure&quot;, a limited series written by Kevin VanHook and a crossover arc with &quot;&quot; (2009). The story chronologically follows the events of the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; and &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; (2008). Oracle has returned to Gotham, and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded, she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham. The Calculator&#x27;s plans finally come to their fruition, and Kuttler, hoping to save his dying daughter Wendy takes on the &quot;Babbage&quot; alias and begins prowling the digital world of &quot;Alta Viva&quot;, a virtual world game, for fragments of the Anti-Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid. Oracle, now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham, becomes aware of Kuttler&#x27;s activities after &quot;Cheesefiend&quot;, one of her informants, is brutally killed, with the Anti-Life Equation itself, after coming in contact with Babbage. Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti-Life Equation in his possession, Oracle travels to Hong Kong, hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage. However, the Calculator discovers her attempts, swearing vengeance upon her. She manages to defeat Calculator, rendering the Anti-Life Equation&#x27;s fragments useless.

In 2009, the &quot;Batgirl&quot; comic book was relaunched with Stephanie Brown starring as the title character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. She also mentors the Calculator&#x27;s daughter, Wendy Harris, who was disabled following an attack at Titans Tower. Oracle later takes a job as an assistant professor at Gotham University. During the Green Lantern limited series &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. Oracle and Commissioner Gordon are both present. &quot;Origins &amp; Omens&quot; hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern&#x27;s intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, the Gordons find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight&#x27;s deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle&#x27;s body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin&#x27;s parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father&#x27;s wounds.

In Greg Rucka&#x27;s &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #862, Barbara Gordon is approached by Huntress and Renee Montoya (the new Question) for help in tracking down a mysterious criminal who ordered a hit on them. Montoya is flabbergasted upon discovering that &quot;Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s daughter&quot; is a superhero. In 2010, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; was relaunched with Gail Simone returning to write the comic. The first arc is a tie-in with the Green Lantern &quot;Brightest Day&quot; limited series. Oracle reforms the Birds of Prey, this time with Dove and the recently resurrected Hawk as members. A new villainess calling herself the White Canary begins menacing the Birds, and publicly reveals Black Canary&#x27;s civilian identity and frames her for a murder. While the team contends with White Canary in the streets of Gotham, Oracle is kidnapped by her former associates, Savant and Creote. This is eventually revealed to be a ruse in order to trick White Canary. Following the team&#x27;s victory against White Canary, Oracle fakes her death during a battle with Calculator. With most of the criminal underworld now believing that she is dead, Oracle cuts off ties with all but a select few Gotham heroes, and is shown refusing to help Blue Beetle, Manhunter, and Booster Gold when they attempt to call her for assistance during battle.

In Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Batman: The Return&quot; (2010), an installment of the limited series &quot;Bruce Wayne: The Road Home&quot; (2010), Batman enlists Oracle to help him run Batman Incorporated, a new global team of Batmen. He tasks her with helping him fight crime on a virtual front and shows her a new modified Batgirl design that acts as her virtual avatar. Oracle is later shown directing Cassandra Cain, now known as &quot;Black Bat&quot;, on a mission in Hong Kong, where she captures some heroin smugglers for Batman. In Scott Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Black Mirror&quot; storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer. He stabs her in both of her legs, positioning the knives so that if she removes them, she will bleed to death. As she slowly bleeds, she can use her wits to distract him long enough for Batman and Commissioner Gordon to arrive and defeat her brother.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, and other appearances (2011–2016)===
In September 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new &quot;Batgirl&quot; series—one of &quot;The New 52&quot; titles featuring the company&#x27;s most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, &quot;our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters.&quot; Barbara Gordon is biological daughter of James Gordon and Barbara Eileen Gordon in this continuity. Wayne also stated that &quot;&quot;The Killing Joke&quot; still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences. Public reaction to the change has been mixed and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as &quot;being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

DC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio explained the decision by stating that &quot;[w]e didn&#x27;t want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she&#x27;ll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl]. We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We&#x27;re always looking to re-position to be reflective of today&#x27;s audience.&quot; Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: &quot;For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It&#x27;s a bit of a shock, to be sure, but we&#x27;re doing everything we can to be respectful to this character&#x27;s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time ... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling.&quot;

In the new, revised continuity, the events of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic. Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is &quot;one of the smartest and toughest women in comics ... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops&quot;, a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character&#x27;s recovery is based upon real-life experiences in that &quot;some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it&#x27;s some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara&#x27;s spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate.&quot;

Prior to release, &quot;Batgirl&quot; #1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, &quot;Justice League&quot; #1, &quot;Batman&quot; #1, &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #1, &quot;&quot; #1, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1, &quot;Flash&quot; #1, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #1, and &quot;Superman&quot; #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; states in a review of the first issue: &quot;The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone&#x27;s script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding ... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [segue] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic George Gene Gustines wrote: &quot;Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series.&quot; Earning a B+ rating in a review from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker writes that Simone &quot;[takes] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror.&quot;

Since the series relaunch in September 2011, &quot;Batgirl&quot; has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best-selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America. Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows: &quot;Batgirl&quot; #1 with 81,489 copies (ranked 12th overall), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #2 with 75,227 (ranked 14th), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #3 with 62,974 (ranked 18th), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #4 with 53,975 (ranked 23rd), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #5 with 51,327 (ranked 26th), and &quot;Batgirl&quot; #6 with 47,836 (ranked 30th). The hardcover edition of volume 1, &quot;Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection&quot;, which collects issues #1–6, made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, alongside &quot;Animal Man: The Hunt&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin: Born to Kill&quot;, &quot;Batman: Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman: Blood&quot;, &quot;Batwoman: Hydrology&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern: Sinestro&quot;.

Additionally, Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #1, where Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster. She declines Canary&#x27;s invitation, suggesting that Katana take her place instead. Series writer Duane Swierczynski has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue #4. He commented that while she &quot;is an essential part of this team&quot;, she is not the focus of the series, as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws.

In October 2014, the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft reboot with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher (writer) Cameron Stewart (writer, layouts), Babs Tarr (artist) and Maris Wicks (colors). The first six-issue story explored Barbara Gordon&#x27;s attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside. While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone&#x27;s darker preceding run, the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs&#x27; inability to fully escape her and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans, an algorithm similar to the pre-New 52 Oracle. While the reboot was highly praised for its innovative use of social media, its fun and energy, and particularly for Tarr&#x27;s art, several critics condemned the villain Dagger Type in issue #37 as a transphobic caricature. In response, the creative team issued a joint apology and revised the issue for the subsequent collected edition, &quot;Batgirl Vol. 1: The Batgirl of Burnside&quot;.

On March 13, 2015, DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to &quot;Batgirl&quot; #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl&#x27;s shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand as if gesturing to shoot her.

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character&#x27;s history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew hundreds of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, &quot;My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.&quot;

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 5) and &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot; (2016–2020)===

In March 2016, DC Comics announced it would be relaunching all of its monthly titles in an initiative called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;. The relaunch restored elements of the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; DC continuity while maintaining elements of The New 52 as well. The DC Rebirth Batgirl would remain Barbara Gordon, who would star in two monthly series: &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 5), written by Hope Larson, and &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot;, written by Julie Benson and Shawna Benson. The two comic book titles debuted in July and August 2016, respectively. In volume five of &quot;Batgirl&quot;, Barbara Gordon is a student attending Burnside College in the trendy Burnside neighborhood of Gotham City.

Barbara later resumes her role as Oracle, providing comms and tactical support to the Birds of Prey and the Batman Family once again, as part of the 2020 Infinite Frontier relaunch, which restores much of the DC Universe status quo from before The New 52. She takes on the role during the &quot;Joker War&quot; storyline when the team needs a greater tactical advantage than ever to overcome the Joker&#x27;s latest plot, and after her spinal support implant begins to show signs of overuse. However, she retains the right to join Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown in suiting up as Batgirl again in the future.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot; (2020–2021)===
===&quot;Dawn of DC&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot; (since 2023)===
In the &quot;Knight Terrors &quot;story arc of 2023, Batgirl engages battle with Punchline and Royal Flush Gang, after discovering them trying to infiltrate the Clock Tower while other members of the Batfamily are away in the Knightmare Realm.

==Alternative versions==
Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories that involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot;, a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as &quot;Elseworlds&quot; and &quot;All Star DC Comics&quot; have also featured alternate versions of the character.

===Elseworlds===
Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in &quot;Elseworlds&quot; comics since 1997. The &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint takes the company&#x27;s iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes &quot;as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.&quot; The character is given starring roles in the noir-style storyline &quot;Thrillkiller: Batgirl &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), its sequel &quot;Batgirl + Batman: Thrillkiller &#x27;62&quot; (1998), and the one-shot comic &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot; (1998), all of which depict worlds where Barbara is Gotham&#x27;s first bat-themed hero (Bruce Wayne is a police detective who becomes Batman in the 1960s-set &quot;Thrillkiller&quot; series, and merely serves as essentially her &#x27;Alfred&#x27; in &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest&quot; in a timeline where Jim Gordon was killed rather than the Waynes).
In addition, the character has supporting roles in &quot;&quot; (1998), &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2006), and &quot;&quot; (2012). A version of her appears as &quot;Nightwing&quot; in the Smallville comic series, replacing Stephanie Brown as previously promoted.

Barbara Gordon aka Nightwing is featured as Batman&#x27;s partner in the &quot;Smallville Season 11&quot; digital comic based on the TV series, in addition to being a valued member of Wayne Enterprises R&amp;D.

===All Star Batgirl===
In 2005, DC Comics launched its &quot;All-Star&quot; imprint—an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company&#x27;s most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, &quot;All-Star&quot; is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, &quot;[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman.&quot;

An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous &quot;All Star Batgirl&quot; title, written by Geoff Johns; however, the series was canceled prior to publication.

===Future&#x27;s End===
In &quot;Batgirl: Futures End&quot; #1 (Nov. 2014), set in an alternate future, a trio of Batgirls include Casandra Cain, Stephanie Brown, and newcomer Tiffany Fox—the daughter of Lucius Fox and the first African American character to be portrayed as Batgirl.

===DC Bombshell===
In 2015, DC began publishing &quot;DC Bombshells&quot;, a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s. In digital issue #42 (collected as print issue #14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering &quot;the Belle of the Bog&quot;, who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl. &quot;DC Comics Bombshells Annual&quot; #1, published on 31 August 2016, reveals that Barbara Gourdon was a French fighter pilot during World War I. After she lost her boyfriend during the war, she traveled to Louisiana and did indeed become a vampire.

===Batman &#x27;89===
In the &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot; miniseries (which takes place in an alternate continuity of the Tim Burton films), Barbara Gordon is a Sergeant in the GCPD and Harvey Dent&#x27;s fiancée. She has a strained relationship with her father and works with Dent to bring Batman down as both see him as a threat. She turns on Dent after a freak accident disfigured his face and drove him to become a criminal and attempted to arrest him, but her efforts were thwarted by Catwoman. Following the deaths of both her father and Dent, she receives a posthumous package from Dent revealing Batman&#x27;s secret identity and a letter from Catwoman offering her partnership to incriminate Batman and Gotham&#x27;s power elite.

==Critical and editorial commentary==
In the aftermath of &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;, Barbara Gordon&#x27;s paralysis has been the subject of debate, with arguments in favor of, and against, restoring her mobility. Writers, artists, editorial staff, and critics have spoken at great length about the nature of the subject, citing responses from the readership, issues of sexism, diversity, and representation, as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character&#x27;s portrayal.

===Commentary in favor of Batgirl===
Reacting to &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; and Barbara Gordon&#x27;s later character development as Oracle in &quot;Batman: Gotham Knights&quot;, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote &quot;[t]here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant&quot; The Killing Joke&quot; as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker ... [Batman] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair.&quot; Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts &quot;[i]t&#x27;s ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman&#x27;s life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl.&quot; In an article for &quot;Bitch&quot; magazine entitled &quot;The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence&quot;, Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference in the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: &quot;Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.&quot;

Artist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini made attempts to return the character to her original conception. Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that &quot;we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O&#x27;Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character ... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn&#x27;t have enough handicapped characters, so they weren&#x27;t going to do anything with Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer.&quot; Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during &quot;52&quot;, wears a variation of what would have been Gordon&#x27;s new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.

===Commentary in favor of Oracle===
Although critical reception of Barbara Gordon&#x27;s evolution into Oracle has been mixed among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: &quot;We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle.&quot; Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, &quot;Some stories ... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry&#x27;s sacrifice or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker.&quot;

The character went through possible restoration during &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the supervillain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of &quot;War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film&quot; (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that &quot;[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify &#x27;curing&#x27; one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when Christopher Reeve never had that opportunity.&quot;

===Restoration of the character&#x27;s mobility and aftermath===
In June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that &quot;people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It&#x27;s that type of honesty I expect more of ... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.&quot; Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon&#x27;s mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing &quot;Batgirl&quot; with Gordon as the title character was that &quot;[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don&#x27;t stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point.&quot;

Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change. O&#x27;Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, &quot;[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals ... We didn&#x27;t have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn&#x27;t involve violence.&quot; However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, &quot;Barbara Gordon&#x27;s perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration.&quot; Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone&#x27;s skills as a writer. He commented that &quot;[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era ... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I&#x27;m sure her work will be wonderful.&quot;

==Characterization==
===Silver Age===

At the time of her conception, Barbara Gordon&#x27;s character was intended to reflect the women&#x27;s liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crimefighter. Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books. In &quot;The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines&quot; (2009), author Mike Madrid states: &quot;While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the &#x27;40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs.&quot; Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections. Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. To conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair &quot;tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative—not to say dowdy—clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day—busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior.&quot; Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that &quot;[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]&quot;

===Bronze Age===
Despite shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, &quot;by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts&quot;. Her color scheme from the &quot; Adventures of Batman&quot; cartoon is used as her primary outfit. However, by the end of the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of Frank Miller&#x27;s work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise &quot;where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels&quot;. In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.

===Modern Age===
Robin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, &quot;Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews&quot; notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;, stating, &quot;Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings.&quot; Following the character&#x27;s recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being &quot;[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, overcompensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind.&quot;

A defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; issue #10, &quot;State of War&quot;, which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated in an interview that &quot;[s]he&#x27;s less morally conflicted than other characters. She&#x27;s very &#x27;means to an end&#x27; oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She&#x27;s not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she&#x27;ll drop the hammer.&quot; She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone&#x27;s &quot;Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds&quot; when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.

In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: &quot;Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She&#x27;s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she&#x27;s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place.&quot;

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
As part of DC Comics&#x27; 2011 relaunch, &quot;The New 52&quot;, Barbara Gordon&#x27;s paralysis is described as lasting only three years. In &quot;Batgirl&quot; (volume 4), the character&#x27;s age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having earned a degree in forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to have posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt because she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, &quot;I&#x27;m enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She&#x27;s younger, she doesn&#x27;t know everything, she&#x27;s been immersed in school and her life plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she&#x27;s nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her.&quot;
In Batgirl #45, Barbara Gordon began a romantic relationship with Luke Fox, the son of Lucius Fox and the new Batwing. Some of the character&#x27;s background and previous relationships were erased. According to the artist of the new Batgirl series, Babs Tarr, Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson were never romantically involved in the New 52 continuity.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
For DC&#x27;s 2016 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; launch, Barbara Gordon headlines two monthly series: &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 5) and &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot;. &quot;Batgirl&quot; (vol. 5), which is written by Hope Larson and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, begins with Barbara touring Asia to train with Eastern fighters. &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot;, which is written by Julie and Shawna Benson, and is illustrated by Claire Roe, reunites her with former teammates the Black Canary and the Huntress (Helena Bertinelli). The first arc of the series restores her prior history as &quot;Oracle&quot;, as the team works to track down an impostor using the alias. In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; continuity, Barbara continues to operate in Burnside after training in Asia. She also shows a renewed romantic interest in Dick Grayson, but is unsuccessful due to him already being in a relationship.

At the conclusion of the Joker War story arc (which spanned several Batfamily titles), Barbara Gordon appears to take a break as Batgirl and, for now, shift more to working tech support again as Oracle. Many critics and fans have expressed interest in having Barbara as both Batgirl and Oracle, since she&#x27;s capable of doing both. &quot;Batman &amp; the Outsiders&quot; Issue 17 and &quot;The Joker War Zone&quot; indicate that Cassandra Cain (aka Orphan) and Stephanie Brown (aka Spoiler) will both be Batgirls again.

===New Justice===
===Infinite Frontier===
===Dawn of DC===
==Powers and abilities==
===Martial artistry===
According to the character&#x27;s fictional biography, Barbara Gordon trained in Boxing, Capoeira, Judo, Kung Fu, Eskrima, Karate, Kickboxing, Jujutsu, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo earning black belts prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a &quot;star athlete.&quot; Following the events of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, Barbara Gordon continued to train in martial arts as Oracle, despite being paralyzed from the waist down. She has extensive skills with eskrima fighting sticks, small firearms, and batarangs; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency. In the revised continuity of &quot;The New 52&quot;, she reflects on the fact that she has been taking self-defense training since age 6 in &quot;Batgirl&quot; #0 (2012).

===Intelligence and technological skill===
Gordon is written as having a genius-level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character&#x27;s career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the 12 technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.

===Information broker===
As Oracle, Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe&#x27;s heroes. She is a skilled hacker, capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites, military installations, government files, and the properties of Lex Luthor. Batman, himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance. Writer and editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil, who first established Oracle as Batman&#x27;s intellectual equal and source of information, stated that &quot;[i]t was logical for her to be there in Batman&#x27;s world ... Batman would need someone like that.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
Since her debut in the DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the &quot;Batman&quot; television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in &quot;Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed&quot; (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, &quot;Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon.&quot; Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, Barbara Gordon—in her new persona as Oracle—became &quot;more popular, in fact, than she was when she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes[.]&quot; The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. Throughout the character&#x27;s history, Barbara Gordon&#x27;s intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics and is the only female character to appear on the list. In 2011, Barbara Gordon was ranked 17th in both IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot; and &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot;.

===Feminist interpretations===
In &quot;The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines&quot; (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, &quot;she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden.&quot; Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, &quot;Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male.&quot; Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while &quot;Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian ... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her &#x27;civilian identity and ran for Congress.)&quot;

In the 1980s, Barbara Kesel, after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was allowed to write for Barbara Gordon in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. Robin Anne Reid, in &quot;Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews&quot; (2009), wrote that &quot;Kesel&#x27;s version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (1987) and &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; (1988).&quot; She notes that Kesel&#x27;s interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon&#x27;s eventual evolution into Oracle, she states &quot;[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a &#x27;better&#x27; character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that &#x27;better&#x27; character.&quot;

In &quot;Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks&quot; (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that &quot;[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon&#x27;s] accident is advised to consult the source material&quot;, calling the work &quot;sadistic to the core.&quot; Brian Cronin noted that &quot;[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.&quot; Jeffrey A. Brown, author of &quot;Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture&quot; (2011) noted &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; as an example of the &quot;inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry&quot; in light of the &quot;relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.&quot; While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage. Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, &quot;if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.&quot;

Despite views that present the character&#x27;s Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman &quot;rather than standing alone as a leader, such as Wonder Woman&quot; who had no pre-existing male counterpart. In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, &quot;while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names&quot; such as the Batgirl character. Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Marquette University, stated that Barbara Gordon&#x27;s character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman&#x27;s protege, &quot;she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she&#x27;s still basically following in Batman&#x27;s footsteps.&quot; Following &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;, her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, &quot;we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman.&quot;

===Representation for library and information science===
In &quot;The Image and Role of the Librarian&quot; (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even because the character abandons it to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a &quot;career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.&quot; In the essay &quot;Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality&quot; (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that &quot;[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.&quot; Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, &quot;[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life).&quot; Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting &quot;to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD&quot; In her new persona, &quot;the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-dom—the &#x27;information goddess&#x27; as crime-stopper.&quot; Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for business networking. In &quot;How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work&quot; (2008) he states that &quot;[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals.&quot;

Over the years, the American Library Association and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy. These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon. In 2004, artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library. Her Batgirl costume appears in a window&#x27;s reflection. The tagline &quot;Librarians are heroes every day!&quot; appears at the bottom of the poster and bookmark. In 2009, a poster featured Barbara Gordon as the Oracle alongside Batman, Nightwing, Robin, the Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, and Huntress. In 2015, the ALA and DC Comics collaborated on a new set of posters and bookmarks in the ALA&#x27;s &quot;READ&quot; campaign. By herself, Barbara Gordon appears in the &quot;Batgirl of Burnside&quot; guise as envisioned by Babs Tarr. In another design, she appears as the Oracle alongside other members of the extended Bat Family.

===Representation for people with disabilities===
Following the character&#x27;s reinvention as the information broker Oracle, she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for disabled people. In &quot;Unleashing the Superhero in Us All&quot; (2008), author T. James Musler notes that &quot;[f]or quite some time, any handicap was considered insurmountable&quot; citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness. About Barbara Gordon, he states &quot;[r]ather than quitting crime-fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information.&quot; Her character thus signifies that &quot;[n]o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not.&quot; In &quot;The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes&quot; (2004), author Gina Renée Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or—as with Charles Xavier and Daredevil—are introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, &quot;[a]s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it.&quot; James B. South&#x27;s chapter &quot;Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism&quot; in the 2004 book &quot;Superheroes and Philosophy&quot; analyzes how the changes in her life &quot;from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle&quot; drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism.

==In other media==
After the character was introduced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 in January 1967, at the request of the producers of the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series, she was introduced into the television seriesportrayed by Yvonne Craigin the season 3 premiere &quot;Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin&quot;, in September that same year.

Les Daniels, in &quot;Batman: The Complete History&quot; (2004), wrote that the goal of ABC was to &quot;attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men.&quot; According to Craig: &quot;I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle ... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice.&quot; A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes portrayed later on television (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, &quot;her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent&#x27;s face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use.&quot; However, Craig has also stated: &quot;I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model ... They say it&#x27;s because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that&#x27;s lovely.&quot; During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women. Since &quot;Batman&quot;, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot; (1968), Melendy Britt in &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; (1977), Melissa Gilbert in &quot;&quot; (1992), Tara Strong in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997) and &quot;Beware the Batman&quot; (2013), Danielle Judovits in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2004), Mae Whitman in &quot;&quot; (2008) and Alyson Stoner in &quot;Young Justice&quot; (2011). &quot;The Batman&quot; series also showcased the character&#x27;s first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode &quot;Artifacts&quot; (2007). She also appears in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.

Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character&#x27;s progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character&#x27;s complex history stating: &quot;She&#x27;s multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs ... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could&#x27;ve done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius.&quot; Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series &quot;Arrow&quot;, after Felicity Smoak had a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that &quot;Oracle&quot; was taken. Although in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans, she was slated to appear in the live-action &quot;Titans&quot; series, when originally proposed for TNT. This version of the character was to be a wheelchair-using computer expert, but not yet be known as Oracle. This series was subsequently redeveloped for DC Universe without the character. Barbara made her debut in the third season with Savannah Welch. The series depicted her as the Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department and retired from her Batgirl persona after an attack from Mr. Freeze that resulted in the death of her father.

In addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in several video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in &quot;The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; voiced by Tara Strong. She is also in &quot;&quot; for the first time as Oracle. She also appears in &quot;LEGO Batman&quot; for the PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PlayStation Portable. She plays a supporting role as Oracle in &quot;&quot; for the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, serving as Batman&#x27;s guide through Arkham, and is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth, as they both serve as Batman&#x27;s guides in the sequel, &quot;&quot;. A teenage Barbara also appears in the prequel &quot;&quot;, voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne. In the 2008 live-action film, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, a very young Barbara Gordon is depicted. She is credited as &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, while the name &quot;Barbara Gordon&quot; is reserved for Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s wife. She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, voiced by Katherine Catmull for the PC and the PlayStation 3. She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower. She is a playable character in &quot;&quot;, with Kimberly Brooks reprising her role. Barbara has returned in &quot;&quot; where she is voiced by Ashley Greene. In addition, Barbara also appears as a playable character as part of the game&#x27;s season pass.

Barbara Gordon appears in the 2017 animated film &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; voiced by Rosario Dawson. She is introduced taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. This allows for the continuation of still having a &#x27;Commissioner Gordon&#x27; and gives a more prominent role to the character. She later dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner. In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon was in talks to write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film would center on Barbara Gordon, with The New 52 comics by Gail Simone serving as &quot;a starting point&quot; for the film. Whedon was to begin production on the film in 2018, but stepped down in February 2018. In April 2018, after impressing the studio with her work on the forthcoming film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, Christina Hodson was hired as screenwriter for &quot;Batgirl&quot; as well. The studio is actively looking for a female director.

In the final season of &quot;Gotham&quot;, Barbara Lee Gordon is shown as the baby of Jim Gordon and his ex-fiancée Barbara Kean, named by the latter both after herself and after Jim&#x27;s wife Dr. Lee Thompkins. Her parents share custody of her. She appears in the final episode portrayed by Jeté Laurence, where she is taken hostage as the debut action of the new Joker, Gordon&#x27;s attempt to save her being assisted by the new Batman.

Barbara Gordon appears in &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; as a college student in the second-season episode &quot;Riddle U&quot; where she helps Harley and Poison Ivy take down the Riddler and is seen making her own Batgirl costume.

She&#x27;s portrayed by Savannah Welch in the third season of the HBO Max series &quot;Titans&quot;, where she&#x27;s depicted as the commissioner of the Gotham City Police.

Leslie Grace was slated to portray Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in what would have been her live-action solo film and DCEU debut, &quot;Batgirl&quot;, which was planned to premiere exclusively on HBO Max but was cancelled in August 2022.

The character also made a non-speaking animated cameo appearance in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

<text>Cassandra Cain (also known as Cassandra Wayne and Cassandra Wu-San) is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Kelley Puckett and Damion Scott, Cassandra Cain first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #567 (July 1999). The character is one of several who have assumed the role of [[Batgirl]]. Over the years, she has also assumed the names of Black Bat and Orphan.

Cassandra&#x27;s origin story presents her as the daughter of assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva. She was deprived of speech and human contact during her childhood as conditioning to become the world&#x27;s greatest assassin. Consequently, Cassandra grew up to become an expert martial artist and developed an incredible ability to interpret body language to the point of reading complex thoughts, while simultaneously developing limited social skills and remaining mute and illiterate. She also becomes the adoptive daughter of Bruce Wayne/The Batman after she turns on her father and is one of Bruce&#x27;s five children in current continuity (as well as his only daughter).

Cassandra was the first Batgirl to star in her own ongoing &quot;Batgirl&quot; comic book series. She was replaced as Batgirl by Stephanie Brown in a 2009 storyline. She returned in late 2010, where she was shown working as an anonymous agent of Batman in Hong Kong before adopting the new moniker of Black Bat. The character was brought back to mainstream continuity after the company-wide reboot in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin Eternal&quot;, using the code name Orphan, previously used by her father, David Cain. The character&#x27;s full history was restored in DC&#x27;s 2021 &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; relaunch.

The character made her cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, portrayed by Ella Jay Basco.

==Publication history==
Cassandra Cain first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #567 (July 1999), written by Kelley Puckett and penciled by Damion Scott (who are generally credited with her invention).

In 2000, Cassandra became the first Batgirl to be featured in an eponymous ongoing comic book series.

During the &quot;&quot; story arc in 2004, Batman relies heavily on Cassandra to help control the violence of the gang war in Gotham City.

Cassandra took on the role of a villain by becoming the head of the League of Assassins following the &quot;One Year Later&quot; continuity jump, as established in &quot;Robin&quot; #150 (July 2006).

Cassandra then appears in &quot;Supergirl&quot; (vol. 5) #14 (April 2007), battling the title character, (Kara Zor-El).

In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #44 (April 2007), it was revealed that Cassandra battled Supergirl first, before attacking the Teen Titans with the Titans East.

Cassandra reappears later in the &quot;Robin&quot; series.

Cassandra next appears on the roster of Titans East once again wearing the Batgirl costume. Cassandra remained in the role of a villain, under the command of Titans East&#x27;s leader, Deathstroke.

In October 2007, DC announced that Cassandra would be taking up the Batgirl identity as a member of the Outsiders in the upcoming &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; ongoing series to be written by Chuck Dixon, which appears to, or is hoped to, begin resolving the controversy.

In February 2008, Dan DiDio revealed during a convention panel that writer Adam Beechen would be writing a &quot;new Batgirl&quot; miniseries. Beechen himself said that the story would resolve the questions over Cassandra&#x27;s behavior and will be a setup for new Batgirl adventures.

In 2009, Cassandra passes the Batgirl identity to Stephanie Brown.

In July 2010, Cassandra appeared as one of the main characters in a short story written and drawn by Amanda Conner for &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #600, where she helps Wonder Woman and Power Girl in a battle against Egg Fu.

After , it is revealed that Cassandra&#x27;s disillusionment was a ruse, and that she had willingly handed over her Batgirl mantle to Stephanie because she was acting under her mentor&#x27;s orders, and she is now working as a codename-less vigilante.

In 2011, in Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Batman Inc.&quot; series, it is revealed that Cassandra had taken up the name Black Bat.

At C2E2 2011, it was confirmed that Cassandra would be appearing as a main character in Scott Snyder and Kyle Higgins&#x27; mini-series &quot;&quot;.

After the New 52, Cassandra appeared in what appeared to be a variant timeline; however, at San Diego Comic-Con in 2015, James Tynion IV announced that Cassandra would be introduced into mainstream continuity in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin Eternal&quot;.

February 4, 2020 was the debut of Cassandra Cain&#x27;s first graphic novel, &quot;Shadow of the Batgirl&quot;, written by Sarah Kuhn and illustrated by Nicole Goux.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===

Cassandra&#x27;s birth and childhood are revealed in the &quot;Batgirl&quot; series. While seeking a perfect bodyguard for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, David Cain finds a potential mother when he sees Sandra Wu-San fighting her sister Carolyn in a martial arts tournament. Believing that Sandra is holding back for Carolyn, Cain murders Carolyn and lures Sandra into a trap, sparing her life in exchange for giving birth to his child and leaving that child for him to raise. She agrees. After the birth of Cassandra, Sandra sets out to become Lady Shiva.

Cain trains Cassandra from birth to be an assassin. She is not taught to read or write; instead, reading body language is her only language. She is able to read people&#x27;s movements and predict what they are going to do. When she is eight, Cain takes her to kill a businessman. As the man dies, Cassandra reads what he is feeling, realizes what she did, and runs away from her father.

After that, her activities are a mystery, until she first appears during the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; story arc.

===No Man&#x27;s Land===
During the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, after Gotham is leveled by an earthquake and isolated, Cassandra Cain saves Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s life and gains Bruce Wayne&#x27;s approval, and, eventually, becomes the new Batgirl.

Her father, David Cain, sends a video of Cassandra&#x27;s first murder to Bruce Wayne (Batman) attempting to disrupt her status. However, Wayne continues to accept Cassandra after she takes several bullets to save the life of a hired assassin, proving her devotion to protecting human life.

===&quot;Batgirl&quot;===

Bruce Wayne sends Cassandra to Barbara Gordon, currently functioning as Oracle. Barbara says she prefers to live alone but since Cassandra is never home and doesn&#x27;t talk, it is just like living alone. A telepath &quot;rewires&quot; Cassandra&#x27;s brain so that she can think with words and use language, but these abilities come at some cost to her ability to read people&#x27;s body language. As she had relied completely on this ability to fight, she is unable to effectively fight crime. Worried, Bruce Wayne takes away her costume and begins training her in defensive skills.

Cassandra soon discovers that the assassin Lady Shiva can read people like she used to be able to and asks Shiva to reteach her. Lady Shiva accepts on the condition that they would have a duel to the death a year later. As Cassandra would rather be &quot;perfect for a year&quot; instead of &quot;mediocre for a lifetime&quot;, she accepts the offer. When the women fight in a year&#x27;s time, Cassandra dies within minutes. Shiva then restarts her heart, realizing Cassandra had a death wish, so that they can have a real fight. In the subsequent fight, Cassandra beats Shiva but does not kill her.

Though not known for her private life, Cassandra does have a one-time romance with Conner Kent after meeting him on a cruise ship. He shares her first kiss, and she even visits him at his home in Smallville, though the relationship never becomes serious.

Cassandra then helps Batman control the violence of a gang war in Gotham City.

Later, Batgirl moves to Blüdhaven with Tim Drake (the third Robin) at Batman&#x27;s suggestion and with his financial support. There, Deathstroke takes on a contract from the Penguin to kill Batgirl and decides to let his daughter Rose (the current Ravager), do the job instead. Cassandra beats Rose by playing on her emotions to leave her open for a critical strike, giving Deathstroke no choice but to get her medical attention.

During this time, Cassandra starts developing a friendship with Brenda, the woman who owns the local coffee shop, and even a very short-lived relationship with a boy named Zero. Unfortunately, her friends are all killed in the Blüdhaven disaster.

Cassandra also goes undercover for Batman, as Kasumi, in the Justice League Elite, working under Sister Superior to track and eliminate metahuman threats to the population. She works with the Batman&#x27;s old fellow Justice League members Green Arrow and the Flash, and forms a bond with Coldcast, who is the first Leaguer to whom she reveals her identity. Although he is subsequently accused of murder, she and the rest of the team soon realize that he has been manipulated by renegade Elite member Menagerie, who was himself being manipulated by the spirit of Manchester Black as he tried to drive his sister to destroy London. As the JLA falls, the Elite, united by the spirit of Manitou Raven, free Vera and vanquish Black, although the team disbands after this last mission.

Cassandra gathers evidence that indicates that Shiva could be her mother, and seeks her out to confirm this, rejoining the League of Assassins. After she is proclaimed by Nyssa al Ghul as the &quot;One Who Is All&quot;, the students of the League are split, half following Shiva, and the others Cassandra. In the following confrontation, Cassandra is mortally wounded by her &quot;adoptive brother&quot;, the Mad Dog, while heroically saving one of the students under her leadership. Shiva revives Cassandra in a Lazarus Pit, then answers Cassandra&#x27;s questions about her parentage. When Cassandra asked Shiva whether she was still killing, whether she would ever stop, Shiva says she was, and responds, &quot;It&#x27;s why I had you&quot;, so Cassandra agrees to fight her to the death once more.

After a closely matched battle, Cassandra manages to break Shiva&#x27;s neck, paralyzing her. She appears ready to place Shiva in the Lazarus Pit, but Shiva pleads with her not to do so. Instead, Cassandra impales Shiva on a hook hanging over the pit, apparently killing her. Cassandra then abandons the identity of Batgirl and returns to her life as a wanderer.

===One Year Later===

Robin (Tim Drake) captures David Cain and brings him to the League of Assassins as ransom to free Cassandra, only to find that Cassandra is the new leader. Cassandra produces a gun and tells him to shoot Cain and join her league. Upon his refusal, she shoots Cain herself. Tim and Cassandra engage in a fight which ends when the platform they are fighting on explodes. By the time Tim comes back to the original location, Cassandra and Cain are gone and the ninjas&#x27; necks have been snapped. Tim had secretly recorded the conversation, clearing his name, but branding Cassandra as a murderer at the same time.

====Brief Appearances====

Cassandra next surfaces when she is hired by Dark Angel to kill Supergirl and attempts to do so by kidnapping Supergirl&#x27;s friend, Captain Boomerang. Supergirl arrives at the League&#x27;s Tibetan headquarters to confront Cassandra, where they fight. Cassandra uses swords that emit red sun energy which strips away Supergirl&#x27;s powers. However, as Cassandra prepares to kill her, Supergirl mysteriously extrudes crystals from her body which injure Cassandra.

Later, Cassandra approaches Dodge, a wannabe superhero with teleportation powers, wanting him to steal a drug that gives humans metahuman strength in exchange for money. Cassandra (with an ally) plans to use the drug to create an army. She also makes another appearance where she murders the businessman who was producing that drug, who Robin has previously unsuccessfully attempted to bring to justice.

====Teen Titans====

Cassandra is left behind while Batman, Robin, and Nightwing leave for their year-long trip and Harvey Dent is charged with protecting Gotham instead of her. Deathstroke approaches Cassandra and preys on her desire for a loving father as well as her feelings of abandonment. Apparently, Deathstroke manages to inject Cassandra with drugs, from a distance, that warped her mind allowing for him to manipulate her to his liking.

Having gained control of his daughter, Deathstroke recruits her into Titans East, where she resumes the role and costume of Batgirl.

As a member of Titans East, she has a rematch with the Ravager and a brief confrontation with Robin, after which Robin injects Cassandra with a counter-serum (prepared in case Deathstroke regains control of his daughter), and she is apparently freed from Deathstroke&#x27;s control and vows to kill Deathstroke to revenge herself.

However, some time later, when she is working with the Teen Titans, Miss Martian comments that she is more in control of herself now. She faces Deathstroke, Match, and other former Titans East teammates, before being subdued by Risk. Soon after, Cyborg, Raven, and Duela Dent summon former Titans Nightwing, Donna Troy, Beast Boy, and the Flash (Bart Allen), who join them against Deathstroke&#x27;s team. Batgirl attempts to kill Deathstroke, but is stopped and knocked unconscious by Nightwing, who demands that Deathstroke face the courts. However, Deathstroke escapes from the Titans with the help of Inertia, and after the battle is over, Batgirl and Duela Dent both vanish without a word.

===Batman and the Outsiders===

Cassandra retakes the Batgirl mantle to join the Outsiders at Batman&#x27;s request. She moves into the team&#x27;s apartment, but does not show much desire to socialize with her teammates. Batman also offers membership to Green Arrow, who is furious to learn that the former leader of the League of Assassins is on the team as well. While on a mission, Green Arrow and Batgirl battle one another and end up gaining an unusual sort of respect for each other. The team as a whole begins to slowly accept Batgirl into their ranks after she frees all of them from the Chinese military.

After the loss of their leader in the 2008 &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline, the Outsiders are left in disarray. Cassandra, believing that Batman brought her onto the team for just such a contingency, takes command of the group. Together, they undertake a search for the Batman.

===&quot;Batgirl&quot; (2008)===

After Batman is found, Cassandra moves into Wayne Manor, on the trail of her father and Deathstroke. She uses the Batcave&#x27;s computer to locate them but is attacked by Nightwing, who claims she cannot be trusted. Robin and Batman give her the benefit of the doubt.

Due to her research, Cassandra learns that David Cain and Deathstroke started up a school training Cassandra&#x27;s &quot;sisters&quot;. When Cassandra hears that the school&#x27;s purpose was to &quot;cripple the meta-hero community&quot;, she believes Oracle is about to be assassinated and rushes to her base of operations. She locates her father on a rooftop and engages in a one-on-one fight, eventually sending him over a ledge. When he loses his grip, she tries to save him but fails; he falls to another part of the rooftop. Batman, who had followed her, accepts her into the family again and says he will adopt her and make her his daughter.

However, after Bruce Wayne&#x27;s apparent death, Cassandra, apparently disillusioned, passes the cowl to her close friend, Stephanie Brown, then she leaves Gotham.

===Black Bat===

After , it is revealed that Cassandra&#x27;s disillusionment was a ruse, and that she has willingly handed over her Batgirl mantle to Stephanie because she was acting under her mentor&#x27;s orders in the event of his death or disappearance, and gone undercover, using Tim Drake as a regular contact. Following Bruce Wayne&#x27;s public announcement about his intention to create a global team of Batmen, Tim visits Cassandra in Hong Kong, where she has been acting as an codename-less vigilante. He attempts to persuade Cassandra to return to Gotham now that things have returned to normal, but she refuses, saying that Stephanie needs the Batgirl role more than she does. Just before departing, Tim gives Cassandra a copy of her old costume and tells her that if she chooses to stay and fight crime in Hong Kong, he hopes she will do it while wearing a Bat-symbol.

Cassandra takes Tim up on his offer, and joined up with Bruce&#x27;s new group, now wearing a heavily modified costume that uses her original outfit as a base. She now uses the name of Black Bat, and among other activities brings down a heroin-smuggling operation in Hong Kong.

After a new supervillain named the Architect destroys three Gotham bridges with the help of explosives smuggled from Hong Kong, resulting in the deaths of dozens of civilians. Cassandra, feeling guilty over her failure to stop the explosives from leaving China, returns to Gotham and partners with Red Robin, Dick Grayson, and Damian Wayne (the newest Robin) to bring the Architect to justice. During a stakeout at Oswald Cobblepot&#x27;s nightclub, Cassandra is mocked and berated by Damian, who tells her that he is a better hero and that Bruce likely sent her to Hong Kong as a demotion. Despite Damian&#x27;s hostility toward her, Cassandra ultimately saves his life after pulling him out of the club mere seconds before it is destroyed by a bomb. And after Dick discovers that the Architect plans to flood Gotham and kill thousands of civilians, Cassandra and Damian work together to dispose of the explosives that were supposed to sink the city. Once the Architect is defeated and captured, Cassandra decides to stay in Gotham rather than return to Hong Kong.

Cassandra later infiltrates a tournament for hired killers and rescues Red Robin, who had been captured and was about to be sexually assaulted by the half-sister of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. After rescuing Tim, Cassandra apparently kills him with a katana, thus winning the tournament for herself. But in fact, she has merely faked Red Robin&#x27;s death to allow him to escape. The two then travel to Hong Kong to catch a 10-year-old assassin known as the Cricket, but are easily defeated. Just as Cassandra and Tim fall into unconsciousness, the Cricket vows to face them again someday, and tells them that he hopes they will put up a better fight next time.

===The New 52===
In what might be a variant timeline, Cassandra is a member of Barbara Gordon&#x27;s League of Batgirls, operating on the field under her leadership alongside fellow Batgirls Stephanie Brown and Tiffany Fox. Her father, David Cain, is portrayed as a character named the &quot;Orphan&quot;, who raises Cassandra alone and forces her not to speak but to &quot;listen&quot; to body movements and react accordingly with deadly precision. She was intended to be a &quot;gift&quot; to the villain &quot;Mother&quot;, to show her that child assassins can be manipulated through &quot;the old ways&quot; instead of through the use of drugs, but &quot;Mother&quot; rejected her and told Orphan never to do anything behind her back again. Although she is used by Mother to kill Miranda Row, mother of Batman&#x27;s new ally Harper Row, at the conclusion of the storyline, Harper forgives Cassandra for her role in her mother&#x27;s death, while Cassandra&#x27;s own father David sacrifices himself to kill Mother by trapping her in her disintegrating fortress, refusing to allow her to torture others in the future. At the storyline&#x27;s conclusion, Cassandra adopts her father&#x27;s identity of Orphan to continue protecting others.

===DC Rebirth===

As Orphan, Cassandra is later inducted into Batman and Batwoman&#x27;s &quot;boot camp&quot; for young Gotham vigilantes. Orphan is known for being the best fighter on the team. She tries to fight the team&#x27;s battles alone and is known for sneaking into Stephanie Brown&#x27;s and Harper Row&#x27;s apartments in the middle of the night. When Batman is attacked by the Colony, she tries to take them on by herself and is left injured and later sedated after leading the Colony into their base. Clayface helps Batwoman, Red Robin, Spoiler, and the injured Orphan escape.

In August 2024, DC Comics announced a new solo series for Cassandra Cain, marking her return as Batgirl in her own title after nearly two decades. This series, written by Tate Brombal and illustrated by Takeshi Miyazawa, has reignited interest and activity within the fan community.

====Batman and the Outsiders====

Cassandra was a part of the latest Outsiders team, alongside Batman, Black Lightning, Katana, and Signal.

==== Batman: The Joker War Zone ====

In this anthology comic, Cassandra and Stephanie Brown fight the Hench Master in Bludhaven. At the end of the story, both she and Stephanie reclaim the Bat symbol and Cass&#x27;s costume becomes very similar to her previous Batgirl costume. In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; #0, Barbara Gordon – now primarily operating as Oracle again – explains to Huntress that Stephanie and Cass share the Batgirl title, but that she reserves the right to occasionally suit up as Batgirl in future.

=== Infinite Frontier ===
Cassandra makes more sporadic appearances in the main Batman series, like her helping Batman during the Fear State event as well as her teaming up with Stephanie Brown for their own &quot;Batgirls&quot; series. Cassandra Cain also tries to defeat Failsafe (a robot designed by Batman to take him down in case he went rogue) but fails and is temporarily captured before freed. She also confronted Batman during Gotham War for his recent violent actions due to Batman&#x27;s trauma in traveling the Multiverse and Knight Terrors but is swiftly defeated. During the Lazarus Planet event, she meets a non-binary warrior named Xanthe Zhou but is captured by spirits and sent to the spirit world. During &quot;&quot; she confronts a mutated Huntress but manages to calm her down.
Cassandra joined the Birds of Prey. The team consisted of Black Canary, Big Barda, Zealot, Harley Quinn, and Black Canary&#x27;s adopted daughter Sin.

==Abilities==

===Skills and training===
Like the rest of the Batman family, Cassandra has no superhuman powers. As a child, she received intensive training by her father, along with several other members of the League of Assassins, including Bronze Tiger, Merlyn the archer, and a series of instructors hired by her father, including Alpha. Upon taking the mantle of Batgirl, she was trained further by Batman, Oracle, Black Canary, and by Lady Shiva. She received supplementary instruction from Onyx. She is an amazing hand-to-hand combatant and is highly skilled in several martial arts, including Kung Fu, Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, and Ninjutsu. She was also very briefly trained in detective methods by Tim Drake during their time in Blüdhaven.

Cassandra&#x27;s superiority in combat results not just from her excellent physical condition, but from her cognitive functions (the result of her idiosyncratic upbringing) that enables extraordinary feats of coordination as well as perceiving minute changes in an opponent&#x27;s movements and body language. In &quot;Batgirl&quot; #14 (May 2001), the writer, Kelley Puckett, places Cassandra in a position within the story in which her skills are analyzed by a group of government experts. The creative team reveals to the reader that the character has no metagene. Yet her genetic status was felt to be incompatible with her recorded abilities. One expert states, &quot;Her individual moves are borderline human. It&#x27;s her aggregate speed that&#x27;s metahuman. Look—humans can throw a 100 miles-per-hour fastball, smash concrete blocks with their heads, and run 4.2 forties. What they can&#x27;t do is all of that at once. It&#x27;s not so much physical as... as mentally impossible. Too much to coordinate.&quot;

Her upbringing using body language as her exclusive mode of communication also had the effect of enabling her to &quot;read&quot; minute changes in an opponent&#x27;s expressions, breathing, muscles, joint position, and center of gravity which in turn allows her to see or &quot;predict&quot; an opponent&#x27;s moves before they happen. It is possible this ability is only partially the result of her upbringing and that there is a genetic predisposition to it, since Lady Shiva, Cassandra&#x27;s mother, is the only other martial artist known in the DC universe to have this ability. When a telepath &quot;rewired&quot; Cassandra&#x27;s brain to allow her speech, this had the unintended consequence of blocking her ability to &quot;predict&quot; attacks, as though her ability to comprehend physical language was traded for her ability to speak and read. Eventually, Lady Shiva helped her to regain this ability, but how this was done is never revealed.

Cassandra also exhibits extraordinary resistance to pain. On more than one occasion, she has been described as &quot;being able to take a bullet wound and not even bat an eye,&quot; due to additional training received as a child.

===Language skills===
As a side effect of her father&#x27;s training, Cassandra&#x27;s brain developed learning functions different from most. Having been brought up by Cain deliberately without speech, the communication centers of her brain learned body language instead of spoken or written language. Thus, she originally had as much trouble learning spoken and written language as a normal individual would have in learning body language. Although she was able to learn some very basic things (&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;me&quot;) the same way a normal person can learn to recognize smiles and frowns, it took a telepath &quot;rewiring&quot; her brain to teach her to speak and understand English. Even then, she only spoke with extreme difficulty (very falteringly, short sentences with long pauses, frequently using the wrong words, etc.). In &quot;Batgirl&quot; #67 (October 2005), Oracle performed a number of tests on Cassandra, determining the severity of the problem: &quot;The language centers of your brain are all over both hemispheres. Not centralized like with most people. When you try to read or write, your brain doesn&#x27;t know how to keep it cohesive.&quot;

In the 2008 &quot;Batgirl&quot; miniseries, the first issue delves into an explanation as to Cassandra&#x27;s increased verbal and literary skills. It is explained that during the year in which Batman, Nightwing, and Robin were abroad, Cassandra and Alfred took it upon themselves to help develop the skills that she lacked due to her less than conventional childhood. By day, she took speech and ESL courses. The formal training aided her thought processes related to language and thus her verbalization improved rapidly.

===Costume and equipment===
Cassandra&#x27;s costume as Batgirl is composed of black skin-tight leather. Her mask covers all of her head with the exception of the eyes, which are darkened, and symbolic stitches surround the mouth of the mask. Cassandra wears a yellow-rimmed black logo rather than the yellow bat version of the logo worn by Barbara. The costume was first created and worn by the Huntress in the early stages of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;.

Like the other members of the Bat-Clan, Cassandra&#x27;s Batgirl also wears a yellow-pouched utility belt which contains grappling hooks, batarangs, mini-explosives, tracking devices, a hand-held computer, binoculars, PlastiCuffs, and smoke pellets. However, Cassandra rarely uses any of these devices.

The costume displays slight variations in Titans East. The cape shows a yellow lining and Cassandra wears a &quot;capsule&quot; utility belt rather than pouches. In &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 3) #43, the once hollow bat-symbol appears to have been filled in and her cape is once again completely black; a new line of stitching goes up the forehead of her cowl. This version of the costume apparently results from one artist&#x27;s interpretation, as Cassandra&#x27;s appearances elsewhere (i.e., &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;) show her wearing her standard Batgirl costume.

Her costume as Black Bat incorporates her former Batgirl costume, with some modifications. She now wears a domino mask and exposes the rest of her face and head. Her cape is now severely torn, looking ragged and almost smoke-like. Her hands are wrapped in bandages rather than her former scalloped bat-gloves.

The costume she currently wears as Orphan consists of a form-fitting longsleeved black top, gloves, and full head mask; occasionally she has worn a variant with an attached hood and no mask. Her pants are looser and baggier in the thighs to allow greater flexibility with her acrobatics, and she wears knee-high black boots. The entire costume has yellow accents, with small armor plates in strategic areas on the torso and arms, and includes a yellow utility belt.

==Controversy==
Critical reception of Cassandra&#x27;s villainous turn in the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline was mixed. In general, the portrayal of Tim Drake was praised, whereas Cassandra&#x27;s depiction was not. Upon being asked if Cassandra&#x27;s characterization was editorially mandated, writer Adam Beechen stated, &quot;When I came to the book, I was told that the first arc would deal with presenting Cassandra as a major new enemy for Robin. From there, I worked out the details of just how that would come about with our initial editor, Eddie Berganza, and then his successor, Peter Tomasi.&quot; In a follow-up interview, he clarified further, stating, &quot;They didn&#x27;t present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn&#x27;t answer.&quot;

In interviews and press conferences, Dan DiDio and others have stated that Cass will &quot;be going back to basics&quot;, as in her early adventures before she was able to talk. Later, Geoff Johns was quoted as saying, &quot;We will be addressing in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; exactly what the deal is with her. Is she a bad guy? How? Why? She was a completely different character before &#x27;One Year Later,&#x27; so let&#x27;s find out what happened.&quot;

According to &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; #182, the storyline was &quot;one of the most controversial changes to come out of DC&#x27;s &#x27;One Year Later&#x27; event&quot;, and &quot;fans rose up in arms, organizing websites and letter-writing campaigns to protest the change.&quot; Dan Didio commented, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see there was a reaction created, it shows that people care about the character and want to see something happen with her.&quot;

<text>Powelton Village is a neighborhood of mostly Victorian, mostly twin homes in the West Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is a national historic district that is part of University City. Powelton Village extends north from Market Street to Spring Garden Street, east to 32nd Street, west to 40th and Spring Garden Streets, and to 44th and Market Streets.

==History==
Powelton Village takes its name from the Powel Family, 17th and 18th century Welsh colonialists who held extensive estates in the area. Samuel Powel served as mayor of Philadelphia from 1775 to 1776 and again from 1789 to 1790. As in other parts of West Philadelphia, in the late 1800s trolley lines opened the area up to urbanization. Powelton soon became a choice residential spot for Philadelphia industrial tycoons.

Powelton&#x27;s luster began to wane by the 1920s, and by the 1940s the neighborhood was populated by low-income families. In the 1960s the Village was home to many members of the counterculture movement, and Powelton today enjoys a strong political activism and anarchist tradition, as well as a healthy multiethnic pluralism.

In addition to the Powelton Historic District, the Bell Telephone Exchange Building, The Powelton, Frederick A. Poth Houses, and John Shedwick Development Houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Neighborhood==
Commercial activity in Powelton Village is concentrated on Lancaster Avenue between 35th and 39th St. Years ago, a developer called this portion of Lancaster Avenue “The Rodeo Drive of West Philly” and this is slowly becoming a reality. Many local businesses benefit from both Powelton residents and college students. The Avenue is lined with shops, restaurants and other retail establishments including a bank, locksmith, dance studio, juice bar, gym, vintage clothing stores, barber shop, Philly&#x27;s largest gaming shop, jewelry and textile stores, two coffee shops, and Asian, Indian, and Philly fare restaurants.

Residential streets are mostly lined with Victorian twin houses, some of which are traditional family homes, while others have been subdivided into apartments. Detached houses, row houses, and apartment buildings also dot the neighborhood.

The southern end of Powelton Village includes property owned by Drexel University. Many students from Drexel live off-campus in Powelton&#x27;s urban-structured row-house apartments because of the short walk to campus.

==Transportation==
Powelton is easily accessed by automobile and public transportation. The neighborhood is close to Interstate 76, and several major streets, including Market, Spring Garden, and 34th, cross the neighborhood. Bike lanes run along Haverford Avenue, Spring Garden Street and its bridge, Lancaster Avenue, and on 38th and 34th Streets south of Lancaster Avenue.

The neighborhood is close to two subway stops on the Market–Frankford Line, located at 34th and Market and 40th and Market. Powelton is also easily accessed by trolley: the route 10 trolley runs on 36th Street between the Ludlow Street portal and Lancaster Avenue, continuing west on Lancaster Avenue. Additionally, there are two underground trolley stops close to Powelton: 33rd and Market, serving all trolley lines, and 36th and Sansom, serving all lines except route 10. Bus route 31 runs through the neighborhood, traveling north on 33rd, Baring, and 35th, and south on 37th, Baring, and 34th. Route 43 runs east on Spring Garden Street and west on Haverford Avenue. The neighborhood is adjacent to 30th Street Station, which serves all Northeast Corridor trains, the New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line, and all Regional Rail lines, as well as the Market-Frankford Line and the subway-surface trolley lines.

==Arts and culture==
Several art and photo galleries have opened along Lancaster Avenue from 36th to 40th. The Community Education Center, at 35th and Lancaster, holds various community events and gatherings. Spiral Q Puppet Theater is located on Spring Garden Street between 31st and 32nd Streets. Nearby destinations include The Bridge, a movie theater at 40th and Walnut; and the Philadelphia Zoo at 34th and Girard.

During Lancaster Avenue&#x27;s &quot;Second Fridays,&quot; shops and galleries are open later and often have various specials, and the event often features live music.

==Education and Hospitality==
Public education choices include the Samuel Powel Elementary School at 36th and Powelton, the Drew School at 37th and Lancaster, and University City High School at 36th and Filbert. The University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University have significant presences in the neighborhood, as well as in adjacent areas to the south.

To serve these two universities, several hotels are located nearby, including the Sheraton at 36th and Chestnut, and The Inn at Penn, located between 36th &amp; 37th Sts. on Sansom St. In Powelton proper, there are several bed-and-breakfasts, including the Cornerstone at 33rd and Baring Sts..

<doc id="858046" wikidata="Q2756453" url="?curid=858046" title="Idflieg aircraft designation system">
<text>The &quot;[[Idflieg]]&quot; (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen/Inspectorate of Flying Troops) designation system was used to classify German heavier-than-air military (as opposed to naval) aircraft from the early days of the &quot;Fliegertruppe/Luftstreitkräfte&quot; to the end of World War I. The system evolved during this period as new classes of aircraft came into use.

The specific, official &quot;name&quot; of a &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; aircraft type consisted of the name of the manufacturer, the designation allocated to its class or category, and finally a Roman numeral. Thus the first &quot;D&quot;-class aircraft built by Albatros was named the Albatros D.I, the second was the Albatros D.II and so on.

==Application==
A complication in identifying wartime German aircraft is that German manufacturers typically used their own designations; and sometimes gave experimental productions unofficial &quot;Idflieg-style&quot; class numbers, perhaps in the hope of production orders. The &quot;Rs&quot; (giant seaplane), and &quot;CLs&quot; (two-seater seaplane) designations of the Zeppelin-Lindau company are examples, as are the unofficial &quot;Dr&quot; designations of the experimental Euler triplanes, which remained prototypes and were never officially named.

The German Navy had a system for classification of aircraft types but did not use this, nor the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; system, to specify particular aircraft types, preferring to use manufacturers&#x27; designations. Airships were outside either system, being individually numbered in the same way as German destroyers and submarines, mostly in the &quot;L&quot; series. As well as serving to identify types, &quot;Idflieg&quot; class letters were normally included as part of German aircraft serial number markings.

==List of Idflieg class letter prefixes==
;A
:Originally applied to all monoplane aircraft. &quot;A&quot; type aircraft (for example the Rumpler Taube and Fokker M.5) were at no stage limited by any official specification apart from their wing layout; in practice most &quot;A&quot; class aircraft were unarmed two seat reconnaissance or training aircraft. Exceptions were the single-seat Fokker &quot;A&quot; types that became the &quot;E&quot; class fighters when they were armed with synchronised machine guns. After 1915, the &quot;A&quot; class gradually became extinct, as examples reached obsolescence and were discarded. Later monoplanes were included in the &quot;D&quot;, &quot;C&quot; or &quot;CL&quot; classes, with equivalent biplanes.
;B
:Originally all biplanes. Not connected to any official specification, apart from the wing layout. In practice, later types in the &quot;B&quot; class were all low powered unarmed two-seaters, mostly used for training and other second line duties.
;C
:Two-seat armed biplanes (designation introduced by April 1915). This was the first new designation to be introduced after the outbreak of war and the first to have a defining specification. To reduce the vulnerability of early German military aircraft to Allied types equipped with machine guns, &quot;C&quot; types were armed with a rearward firing machine gun operated by the observer and (later) a forward firing synchronised machine gun for the pilot. An engine of more than 150 hp was also specified (later &quot;C&quot; types typically had over 200 hp). A number of future German fighter aces obtained their first victories in a &quot;C&quot; type aircraft
;CL
:Lightweight &quot;C&quot; class aircraft (designation introduced early 1917). Later &quot;C&quot; types became progressively larger – the &quot;CL&quot; specification was intended to provide smaller aircraft, nimble enough to be used as escorts for the heavier &quot;Cs&quot;: effectively two-seat fighters. In practice, the &quot;CL&quot; types were mainly used for close support. Engine power of a &quot;CL&quot; was limited to less than – and total loaded weight to under . In other respects &quot;CL&quot; types were similar to &quot;C&quot;s – in fact serial and type numbers generally fell in the same sequence.
;CN
:&quot;C&quot; class aircraft modified to carry a heavier bomb load for use at night. Designation replaced by &quot;N&quot;.
;D
:Single-seat armed aircraft, specifically intended for use by the new &quot;jagdstaffeln&quot; (fighter) squadrons (designation introduced in 1916). Until late in 1918, when the system was rationalised, &quot;D&quot; implied an armed &quot;doppeldecker (&quot;biplane). By the end of the war all single-seat fighters were designated as &quot;D&quot; types, as distinctions based on wing layout were abandoned.
;DJ
:Armoured &quot;D&quot; class aircraft. The only type in this class was the prototype AEG DJ.I and the designation may not have been official.
;Dr
:Single-seat armed triplane, (&quot;Dreidecker&quot; ). Designation introduced in late 1917 and abandoned in late 1918. The first two Fokker Dr.I service test aircraft were in fact called &quot;F.I&quot;. By the end of the war all new single-seat fighters became &quot;D&quot; types, regardless of wing layout.
;E
:Armed monoplane (designation introduced in 1915 – abandoned in late 1918), from &quot;Eindecker&quot;. This was initially simply the monoplane version of the &quot;C&quot; class armed biplane, having the same relationship to the &quot;C&quot; class as the &quot;A&quot; had to the &quot;B&quot;, and several early &quot;E&quot; types were two-seaters. In practice, due largely to the success of the single seat Fokker &quot;E&quot; types, which were single-seat fighters, the &quot;E&quot; class came to mean a single-seat fighter monoplane (i.e. the monoplane equivalent of the &quot;D&quot; class). In late 1918 the last &quot;E&quot; type, the Fokker E.V was redesignated the &quot;D.VIII&quot;, and other late war monoplane types (such as the Junkers CL.I) were also designated in their &quot;functional&quot; class, in line with the abandonment of designations based on wing layout.
;F
:Single-seat armed triplane (designation used briefly in 1917). Applied only to the Fokker F.I, which was redesignated the &quot;Dr.I&quot; by the time it went into production.
;G
:Armed twin-engined biplane bomber aircraft, originally bore the &quot;K&quot; (&quot;Kampfflugzeug&quot; - &quot;battle aircraft&quot;, see below) designation at the war&#x27;s start, became &quot;G&quot; (&quot;Großflugzeug&quot; - &quot;large aircraft&quot;) in 1915. 
;GL
:Faster twin-engined aircraft suitable for use as day-bombers or for long range reconnaissance (designation introduced in 1918). Bore a similar relationship to the &quot;G&quot; as the &quot;CL&quot; bore to the &quot;C&quot;. Weight and wing span were reduced, and crew was limited to two – the forward gunner’s cockpit being eliminated.
;J
:Armoured dual-role liaison aircraft and ground attack aircraft (designation introduced in 1917). Most examples resembled &quot;C&quot; types in general layout – differing only in being fitted with armour to reduce vulnerability to ground fire. The exception to this was the Junkers J.I, designed specifically as an armoured aircraft.
;K
:Armed biplane bomber aircraft with two or three engines (&quot;Kampfflugzeug&quot;–&quot;battle aircraft&quot;). Designation introduced early in 1915, and replaced by &quot;G&quot; later that year. (see &quot;G&quot; types above) 
;L
:Heavy bomber mid way between G and R classes. Applied only to the Siemens-Schuckert L.I, which never saw operational service.
;N
:Two-seat single engined night (&quot;Nacht&quot;) bomber. Basically a &quot;C&quot; type aircraft with longer wing span to enable a heavier war-load. Designation introduced in 1918, superseding &quot;CN&quot; specification.
;R
:Large bomber aircraft with at least three, in some cases up to six engines (&quot;Riesenflugzeug&quot;–&quot;giant aircraft&quot;). An important distinguishing feature from the &quot;G&quot; class (apart from size) was that all engines should be accessible in flight to permit running repairs.

==Post war==
The system ceased to apply with the end of German military aviation following the Armistice; in the nineteen twenties and thirties, although the Fokker company gave its new military types &quot;Idflieg&quot; style numbers, to continue war-time sequences. Fokker two seat military reconnaissance aircraft continued the wartime &quot;C&quot; series and Fokker single-seater fighters were given numbers in the &quot;D&quot; series to exploit the reputation of the wartime D.VII. Aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; were named according to the RLM aircraft designation system.

<doc id="858063" wikidata="Q6623949" url="?curid=858063" title="List of independent radio stations">
<text>This is the list of independent radio stations. Included are any non-profit terrestrial broadcast community radio stations not directly affiliated, owned, or otherwise controlled by any radio network, school, company, or government. All independent radio listed stations are independently operated (&quot;not&quot; necessarily the radio format indie music), and are considered to be community radio. A counterpart to this list is the list of college radio stations (some of the college radio stations are also community radio stations).

<text>Heunginjimun (), more commonly known as Dongdaemun (), is one of The Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, a prominent landmark in central Seoul, South Korea. The Korean name &quot;Dongdaemun&quot; means &quot;Great East Gate,&quot; and it was so named because it was the major eastern gate in the wall that surrounded Seoul during the Joseon period. The gate is located at Jongno 6-ga in Jongno District.

==History==
The structure was first built by King Taejo during his fifth year of reign (1398). It was renovated in 1453, and the current structure is the one rebuilt in 1869.
Heunginjimun shows architectural style of the late Joseon period. The most unusual characteristic is its built outer wall, Ongseong. Ongseong was constructed to compensate the weakness of the target from multiple invaders, protecting the gate.

==Preservation==
Heunginjimun is located at the intersection of subway lines 1 and 4, at Dongdaemun Station (). The gate is within easy reach of exit 1 or exits 6–10 of this station.

Construction of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a major urban development landmark designed by Zaha Hadid, started in 2009 to renovate what used to be Dongdaemun Stadium (an amateur baseball park) and was officially inaugurated on March 21, 2014. This landmark, also called the DDP, is the centerpiece of South Korea&#x27;s fashion hub and popular tourist destination and has been one of the main reasons for Seoul&#x27;s designation as World Design Capital in 2010.

In August 2011, the roof of the gate was partially damaged by record rainfall. The large amount of rain resulted in chipping of the roof&#x27;s ridge. An official of the Cultural Heritage Administration stated that &quot;The aged gate underwent repairs in 1998 and seems to have become soaked in heavy rains&quot;.

By 2025, the area around Dongdaemun known as Dongdaemun Market has grown into the largest shopping center in South Korea, popular with both foreigners and natives.

<text>Ohio Wesleyan University (abbrevriated OWU) is a private liberal arts college in Delaware, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1842 by Methodist leaders and Central Ohio residents, and is a member of the Ohio Five – a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges.

The site is 27 miles (44 km) north of Columbus, Ohio. It includes the main academic and residential campus, Perkins Observatory, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve.

== History ==
=== Founding (1841–1855) ===
In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university &quot;of the highest order&quot; in central Ohio. To that end, they purchased the Mansion House Hotel, a former health resort featuring the Sulphur Spring, using funds raised from local residents. Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing &quot;the democratic spirit of teaching&quot;, which was approved by the Ohio State Legislature. Early in the following year they opened the college preparatory academy and formed a board of trustees. Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after John Wesley, founder of Methodism, opened on November 13, 1844, as a Methodist-related but nonsectarian institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.

Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s first president, Edward Thomson, stated in his inaugural address on August 5, 1846, that the school was &quot;a product of the liberality of the local people.&quot; This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s vocal opposition to slavery in the 1850s. In the annual celebration for George Washington&#x27;s birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick endorsed Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s &quot;ideals of democracy&quot; during his oration.

=== Early growth (1855–1930) ===
During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment. Sturges Hall was constructed as the university&#x27;s first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall. The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.

By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844). To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU&#x27;s new academic position. University Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.

Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for physics, zoology, geology, speech, history, French, English, and economics. This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe. Two professional schools for law and medicine were formed in 1896.

In 1905, the board of trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word &quot;university&quot; in the institution&#x27;s name. The Bachelor of Science degree was abolished, which left only the Bachelor of Arts. Two students were selected as Rhodes Scholars in 1905 and 1909. Edwards Gymnasium was built in 1906. In 1907, the United Societies of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the &quot;Eta of Ohio&quot; ΦΒΚ chapter on campus. In 1909, the school added Sanborn Hall, housing the Music Department.

In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor&#x27;s degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized. During the presidency of John W. Hoffman (1916–1928), the academy and School of Business were closed; the academy had started in 1842 as a preparatory school, and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment. Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and sororities were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and Perkins Observatory; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.

=== Curriculum changes (1930–1984) ===

During the Great Depression, both enrollment and alumni donations shrank. While the faculty size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college&#x27;s survival in the administrations of Edmund D. Soper (1928–1938), Acting President Edward Loranus Rice (1938–1939), and Herbert John Burgstahler (1939–1949).

The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems. Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from New England states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920s and led to debate among board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university&#x27;s current active but loose historical affiliation with the United Methodist Church. In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that &quot;in its personnel, its resources, and its students&quot;, Ohio Wesleyan lost its &quot;symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church.&quot;

In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new &quot;Centennial Curriculum&quot;, which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement. Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men&#x27;s dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954. In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control. They eventually settled on a new &quot;statement of aims&quot; that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women&#x27;s Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.

Thomas Wenzlau&#x27;s presidency (1968–1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the ROTC building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970. Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period. Wenzlau&#x27;s presidency witnessed decline in students&#x27; test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing &quot;party school&quot; image, leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body. Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper &quot;The Transcript&quot; frequently criticized Wenzlau&#x27;s presidency, blaming it for &quot;severely affecting the reputation of the college&quot;. This exchange resulted in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau&#x27;s presidency.

=== Contemporary period (1984–present) ===

The president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a &quot;live-in&quot; presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts. Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the ABC and NBC networks.

More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled &quot;Educating America&#x27;s Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges,&quot; identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective &quot;science-active&quot; liberal arts institutions in the nation. The Battling Bishops won NCAA Division III national championships in men&#x27;s basketball (1988) and men&#x27;s (1998, 2011) and women&#x27;s (2001, 2002) soccer. Despite these efforts, Ohio Wesleyan is one of many liberal arts colleges in the United States that is experiencing declining enrollment. The 2017 incoming class was 9% smaller than the year before.

Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton-Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship. The Schimmel/Conrades Science Center opened in 2004 to provide of additional space for the science departments. In 2011, the Meek Aquatics Center opened as a state-of-the-art facility, also used by the Delaware community. In 2018, the university opened the Delaware Entrepreneurial Center at OWU in collaboration with the City of Delaware and Delaware County. In 2019, Ohio Wesleyan announced an ambitious Residential Renewal project, committing $60M to renovating existing buildings and the construction of a new village of apartments.

== Campus ==

The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north–south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus.

=== Other facilities and off-campus programs ===
OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual, and media arts (a GLCA arts program), Perkins Observatory, The Strand Theatre, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve.

Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus. The observatory is named after Hiram Perkins, a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college. When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest telescope in the world, which has since been moved to Arizona. The Perkins dome now houses a telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio.

The university also maintains offices for study abroad, US domestic study, and internship programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in Washington, D.C., in research and internship positions. The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently. and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in New York City.

=== Community relations ===
OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware. Students participate in Delaware&#x27;s community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an experiential learning partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools. More than 150 Ohio Wesleyan students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from Columbus.

The Ohio Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community, and exposes international students to American culture through the community. The program&#x27;s ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in events for local non-profit community organizations.

Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of civic engagement and activism. Progress OWU allows students from Ohio Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on politics, public policy, and corporate and social issues, both on campus and in the local community.

Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts. In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic Strand Theatre in downtown Delaware.

The university and the City of Delaware sponsor several events in town throughout the year: the Delaware Arts Festival, the Little Brown Jug, the Delaware County Fair, and the Castle Arts Affair. The Delaware Arts Festival is an annual event held the weekend after Mother&#x27;s Day on the streets of Historic Downtown Delaware. The festival hosts over 170 booths featuring works of local, regional, and other artists. OWU professors chair the committees that select winners. The Little Brown Jug, a harness race, is run during the Delaware County Fair in September. The OWU president and the college mascot traditionally award the trophy for the first division of the first heat of the race.

== Academics ==

=== Profile ===

Ohio Wesleyan University is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, and is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Oberlin Group, and the Five Colleges of Ohio, a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges which also includes Kenyon College, Oberlin College, The College of Wooster, and Denison University.
For 2011, Ohio Wesleyan accepted approximately 52% of its regular decision applicants, 33% of its transfer applicants, and had a yield rate of 26%. In 2010, the college accepted 36% of its international applicants. The middle 50% range of matriculating students for the class of 2010 was 1125–1320 for the SAT (old scale) and 24–30 for the ACT. Approximately 35% of accepted applicants were granted internal scholarships. Ohio Wesleyan follows a need-blind admission policy; financial circumstances are not considered when deciding whether to admit applicants. As of 2010, OWU&#x27;s 1,950 students come from 43 states and 57 countries; 47% are from Ohio, 11% are international, and 54% are female. The student body is about 10% Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 9% Black. Fifty-nine percent of Ohio Wesleyan students claim no religious affiliation. The student-faculty ratio is 11:1 and faculty members teach all classes. Excluding independent studies and senior theses, nearly 60% of Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s class sections have fewer than twenty students enrolled. Ohio Wesleyan is generally known for a strong &quot;left-leaning&quot; student body and an administration with a &quot;permissive&quot; attitude. In 2007, 60% of OWU students favored the Democratic Party. In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, &quot;Niche&quot; ranked Ohio Wesleyan 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college in the U.S.

Ohio Wesleyan admits students of all cultures, lifestyles, and socio-economic backgrounds. An index examining gay-friendly policies places OWU among the nation&#x27;s gay-friendly colleges, and the university enacts policies to meet the six criteria developed by the Campus-Pride organization for recruiting and supporting students from a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population. Nearly 18% of students at Ohio Wesleyan receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. This measure indicates the degree to which economically disadvantaged groups are represented at OWU.

The faculty consists of 142 tenured members. As of 2010, all the university&#x27;s tenured or tenure-track faculty members hold a PhD or other terminal degree. The faculty is 37% female and 63% male, with 10% from underrepresented groups. Also as of 2006, women constitute 37% of the tenured professors and earn 94% of what male professors earn – numbers which suggest favorable gender circumstances.

=== Curriculum, degrees and majors ===
Freshmen are paired early in their first year with academic advisors who oversee their students&#x27; academic progress. Upon completing 34 units of coursework, students may earn diplomas in Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Music. Ohio Wesleyan has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines; as of 2019, OWU offered nearly 90 majors.

In its early days, OWU&#x27;s curriculum began with classical studies, for the course catalogue maintained that &quot;the classical course in Greek and Latin and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit.&quot; Scientific courses were added to Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s curriculum in 1849, and since then, scientific subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum. OWU also has a highly respected music department.

Its most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Zoology/Animal Biology (23)
*Psychology (21)
*Sports, Kinesiology, &amp; Physical Education/Fitness (16)
*Business Administration &amp; Management (15)
*History (15)
*Political Science &amp; Government (12)

=== Emphasis on internationalism ===

Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic internationalism since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded Kwassui Women&#x27;s College in Nagasaki, Japan, when predominant Japanese culture considered women&#x27;s education unimportant. Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan. In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to Africa and opened a school in Mutare, Zimbabwe, that eventually became the Africa University. Ada M. Coe was an early woman Spanish Professor here in 1917.

The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students. The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s. In a study adjusted for school size, Ohio Wesleyan came ninth among 118 American colleges and universities in total aid awards to international students and 69th in average award per international student among both large universities and small liberal arts colleges. South East Asian students have significantly contributed to this growth. The United Nations flag, along with the flags of more than sixty represented nations and the U.S. flag, flies in University Hall in honor of the ideal of peaceful international relations.

High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target of the school&#x27;s international focus. Under a Great Lakes Colleges Association agreement, OWU established an exchange program with Waseda University in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in Japan and 30 Japanese students to study at Ohio Wesleyan each year. The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988, conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the University of Salamanca in Spain. The academic collaboration frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the Golden Age in Salamanca.

=== Libraries ===
The Beeghly Library is the main library of OWU. The library contains nearly 500,000 volumes in its collection, and is also home to the Archives of Ohio United Methodism, the Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Artifacts collection, as well as an archival collection of materials related to the history of the university.

The Hobson Science Library is part of the Schimmel Conrades Science Center and supports research in the earth, life, and physical sciences.

OWU has 11 full-time librarians, with subject liaisons for each academic department, as well as a full-time archivist.

== Student life ==

=== Organizations and activities ===
Ohio Wesleyan University has 95 student clubs and organizations. The university offers three chapels as well as several Christian and other religious groups for its students. Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including chess, ultimate, finance, and medieval sword fighting. There are two &quot;a cappella&quot; singing groups on campus, &quot;The OWtsiders,&quot; a student-run group formed in 1999, and the all-female &quot;Pitch Black&quot; established in 2005. Another entertainment-related club is &quot;The Babbling Bishops&quot;, an improvisational comedy troupe. The &quot;Babbling Bishops&quot; started in the fall of 1990 when a group of theatre concentration students formed a performance-oriented project for their theatre degrees. The project became an improv comedy troupe, rehearsing in Stuyvesant Hall and performing with other college improv since 1996.

Socially conscious students can join organizations such as the activist group &quot;Young Democratic Socialists&quot; or participate in student government groups, such as the Campus Programming Board and the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs. The &quot;PRIDE&quot; organization offers support to OWU&#x27;s LGBT students.

Fewer than a third of Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s students are involved in Greek life, but that percentage has fluctuated significantly throughout the university&#x27;s history. All six fraternities and five sororities on campus are currently involved in many philanthropic and community programs. The OWU chapter of Phi Kappa Psi (Phi Psi) was closed after the death of Luke Anthony Gabbert, a pledge who fell into a creek in 2016 after drinking large amounts of alcohol.

OWU&#x27;s oldest student organizations are its literary clubs, including a number of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The school&#x27;s student-run weekly newspaper, &quot;The Transcript&quot;, is the oldest continuously published, independent, college newspaper in the United States. &quot;The OWL&quot;, an annual literary publication, features students&#x27; work and is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest college literary magazines. Other student publications include &quot;The Civic Arts Review&quot;, the electronic &quot;Connect2OWU&quot; bulletin, and &quot;@Wesleyan&quot;, a quarterly online magazine. OWU Radio, formerly WSLN, broadcasts from Phillips Hall, and offers show times to students, faculty, and local citizens of Delaware.

The university also has a student government, the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs (WCSA).

=== Activism ===

Activism as represented in OWU&#x27;s founding vision has had a significant role in Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s history.

The first president, Edward Thomson, staunchly supported the abolition of slavery and liberalism. Other individuals associated with the university have fought racism. Branch Rickey, an alumnus, broke the racial barrier in baseball. Mary King, a civil rights activist, worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. civil rights movement while she was a staff member of OWU&#x27;s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). In the 1980s, Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s administration fully divested holdings connected to South Africa. As of September 2007, Ohio Wesleyan joined a small group of liberal colleges that opposed the methodology and questioned the usefulness of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; college rankings, despite the fact that the magazine ranked Ohio Wesleyan highly.

OWU has partisan political groups ranging from liberal to socialist, such the College Democrats and Young Democratic Socialists of America, and several activism awareness groups such as Black Men of the Future, Black Student Union (formerly Student Union on Black Awareness), PRIDE, Viva Latinx, and Rafiki Wa Afrika. Many students complete internships for state representatives in the nearby state capitol, Columbus.

=== Traditions ===
Many Ohio Wesleyan traditions originate from its early years. Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a &quot;People&#x27;s Parade&quot; with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all-campus carnival. It started as a girls&#x27; athletic fête held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the Monnett Campus, where female students danced around the Maypole, while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.

In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first &quot;Mock Convention&quot;, which has recurred in every United States presidential election year since 1920. Its purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents about the presidential nominating convention, presidential candidate, and key issues in the upcoming election.

Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear &quot;dinks&quot;, red caps with black brims and a black W on the front. This tradition ended in the 1960s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester.

Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s Homecoming takes place in early October, while the Ohio Wesleyan football team plays one of its traditional rivals.

The &quot;President&#x27;s Ball&quot;, a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first Saturday of December. Other traditions include &quot;OWU vs. Denison&quot;, which stages a &quot;fierce&quot; athletic rivalry between Ohio Wesleyan and Denison University; the &quot; Sagan Colloquium&quot;, spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an issue of concern to the liberal arts; and &quot;Orchesis&quot;, an annual celebration of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year. &quot;Fresh-X&quot; is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates.

The campus used to host two major musical events, &quot;Unity through Music&quot; and &quot;Springfest&quot;. &quot;Unity through Music&quot; occurred once a year in the fall semester, and covered various musical styles in a carnival atmosphere, during the day; during the evening, a huge dance is held in the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center. Springfest, the second musical event, proceeded in mid-April and had featured well-known music groups such as Counting Crows, The Roots, Guster, Ben Folds, and Gym Class Heroes. It was organized by the Campus Programming Board, who have changed the name to &quot;Bishop Bash,&quot; in an attempt to create more campus pride.

A rock next to Hayes Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and students continually repaint it with graffiti and slogans.

=== Housing ===
The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus. First-year students are required to live on campus in Smith Hall during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing.

Thomson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus. Welch Hall is designated as a &quot;quiet&quot; dorm for honors students. Hayes Hall is an all-female dorm.

Approximately 90 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are co-ops united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 10–17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op&#x27;s name. As of the 2022–2023 academic year, the SLUs consist of The Creative Arts House&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; The Citizens of the World House&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; The Sexuality and Gender Equality House&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; The House of Linguistic Diversity (HOLD); LA CASA, The Tree House; The Service. Engagement, and Leadership House&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; and The Interfaith House. The university owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the university&#x27;s living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own members and do not have resident advisers or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a resident advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis. In addition the school offers Theme Houses, which do not have to go through the renewal process. They include the Honors House (HoHo) and House of Black Culture.

Off-campus housing is available only to students residing in Delaware, Ohio while living with their spouse or direct family; 17 percent of students live off-campus. Most students assert Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s policy of off-campus housing as one of the &quot;worst things&quot; about Ohio Wesleyan.

== Athletics ==

Ohio Wesleyan participates in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III as a member of the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Known as the &quot;Battling Bishops&quot;, Ohio Wesleyan competes in 25 varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports. The newest sports, men&#x27;s wrestling and women&#x27;s rowing, begin competition during the 2018–2019 academic year. The official school colors are red and black.
Formal athletics at the college date to 1875, when the first football teams were organized to play against other institutions. In the late 1880s, Ohio Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of Ohio behind the pitching of Phil &quot;Lefty&quot; Saylor. The school joined the Ohio Athletic Conference in 1902. In 1983, Ohio Wesleyan joined with nine other colleges in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania to create the North Coast Athletic Conference. The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the athletic one.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse, golf and soccer teams are the most historically successful of the varsity teams, and soccer is the university&#x27;s most intently followed sport. For seven of the last twelve years, Ohio Wesleyan has won the NCAC conference All-Sports Trophy for excellence in both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports. In the Sears Director&#x27;s Cup standings, OWU is among the top 25 overall collegiate athletics programs in the country. Because of the North Coast Athletic Association athletic agreement, the university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic recruiting.

Ohio Wesleyan has won five NCAA Division III Championships, including men&#x27;s basketball (1988), men&#x27;s soccer (1998 and 2011), and women&#x27;s soccer (2001 and 2002). In addition, Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s varsity athletic teams have been NCAC champions over 100 times, leading the Denison Big Red and the Kenyon Owls.

The nickname &quot;The Battling Bishops&quot; dates to 1925. This is also the name of the university&#x27;s mascot, &quot;The Battling Bishop&quot;. Due to its ironic name, the mascot has been listed as one of the weirdest college mascots. Due to its red robe, &quot;The Battling Bishop&quot; looks actually like a Cardinal. Before 1925, Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s teams were referred to as &quot;The Red and Black&quot; and &quot;The Methodists&quot;. Many schools, including several other Methodist ones, also claimed crimson and black as their colors, so the university decided to change the name. 
Ohio Wesleyan maintains athletic rivalries with other NCAC institutions. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team has a historic rivalry with the Denison Big Red, the football team with the Wittenberg Tigers, the soccer team with the Kenyon Owls, and the field hockey team with the Oberlin Yeomen. Both Denison and Ohio Wesleyan issued alerts to their fans specifically for the OWU-Denison lacrosse game about unsportsmanlike behavior and profanity.

In addition to the school&#x27;s varsity athletics, club sports teams, including ultimate Frisbee, chess, indoor hockey, cricket, rugby, ski, and scuba, have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Office of Student Activities. Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s intramural program includes 16 sports. Sports such as skiing, squash, and water polo have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.

&quot;Oh we&#x27;re from dear old Wesleyan&quot; is Ohio Wesleyan University&#x27;s primary fight song. The song&#x27;s lyrics were written in 1914 by Chass Cupett &#x27;1916.

== People ==

=== Administration ===

Under the charter granted by the State of Ohio, the board of trustees possesses the legal authority to operate the college. The charter and bylaws stipulate a board of 34 trustees, of whom one is the president. In general, it is the board that elects the president. Since Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s beginnings, sixteen people have held the title of president, and a few have served as interim president. Former presidents include lawyers, literary scholars, politicians, executives, and clergymen.

After several disagreements between Huddleston and the Ohio Wesleyan administration, Huddleston accepted a position as president of the University of New Hampshire and left Ohio Wesleyan on June 30, 2007, giving him the second shortest presidency, behind David Lockmiller, 1959–1961. On May 29, 2007, the appointment of current university provost Dr. David O. Robbins as interim president was unanimously endorsed by OWU&#x27;s board of trustees. Dr. Robbins&#x27; term as Interim President began on July 1, 2007.

On December 17, 2007, Dr. Rockwell &quot;Rock&quot; Jones was elected to serve as the 16th president of Ohio Wesleyan University. Dr. Jones&#x27; inauguration ceremony took place on October 10, 2008, in Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s Gray Chapel, in University Hall.

=== Alumni ===

Ohio Wesleyan alumni are active in several annual events, organizations, and initiatives. The events and associations with significant alumni involvement are Homecoming, &#x27;W&#x27; Association, and A/PART (the alumni admission team). For the 2005–2006 fiscal year, Ohio Wesleyan&#x27;s alumni giving rate was 35%. A number of the school&#x27;s alumni have made notable contributions in the fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others.

In academia, Frank Sherwood Rowland (class of 1948) won the 1995 Nobel Prize for chemistry for his research on the depletion of the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer. Ezra Vogel (1950) is a prominent author on China-Japan issues and was the director of Harvard&#x27;s Fairbank Center for East Asian Research from 1995 to 1999. William Hsiao (1963) is an economist in the field of international health at Harvard, and the designer of a landmark study to examine the United States&#x27; system of reimbursing physicians for medical services. Dennis R. Appleyard (1961) is the author of an international economics textbook.
In politics, Kathryn Barger serves as Los Angeles County&#x27;s Fifth District Supervisor; Barger graduated in 1983. John Wesley Hoyt (1849) was the third Governor of the Wyoming Territory. Charles Fairbanks (1872) was the 26th Vice-President of the United States. Jo Ann Emerson (1972) served as a U.S. Representative from Missouri. Arthur Flemming (1927) was a Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, was known for his commitment to civil rights, was the recipient of two Presidential Medals of Freedom, and served as president of University of Oregon, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Macalester College. Lucy Webb Hayes (1853), wife of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, was the first woman to be called First Lady, and the first First Lady to hold a college degree.

Notable journalists and media personalities include Frank Stanton (1930), a president of CBS known for supporting broadcast journalism before Congress; Byron Pitts (1982), a national correspondent for CBS News; Wendie Malick (1972), an Emmy-nominated actress known for her role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; and now as &quot;Victoria Chase&quot; on the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;; Melvin Van Peebles (1953), an actor, director, screenwriter, playwright, and composer; Patricia Wettig (1974), the actress who plays vice president Caroline Richards on &quot;Prison Break&quot;; and Clark Gregg (1984), the actor playing Richard in &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot; with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

Numerous Ohio Wesleyan alumni have been associated with social justice. Branch Rickey (1904) was a baseball manager and executive known for signing Jackie Robinson as the first African-American in Major League Baseball. Another graduate, Mary King (1962), worked alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. civil rights movement when she was a young student, and was a member of the staff of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Rev. Norman Vincent Peale (1920) was the author of &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; and the winner of a Presidential Medal of Freedom for his theological contributions. Others found fame in other forms: Mildred Elizabeth Sisk (aka Axis Sally) was the first American woman to be tried and sentenced for treason, convicted of broadcasting for Nazi Germany during World War II. In 1917, she majored in dramatic arts, but did not graduate due to her failure to meet all university requirements. After serving a 12-year sentence, Sisk returned to OWU, where she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech in 1973. James J. Nance an Ohio born industrialist who became president of Hot-Point and later the Studebaker-Packard Corporation. He became chief executive of the Central National Bank of Cleveland, chairman of the executive committee of Montgomery Ward and chairman of the board of trustees of the Cleveland State University.

<text>The Arsenal was an English car manufacturer at St Albans, Hertfordshire, registered 21 October 1898. It folded the next year, in 1899. The Bollée-like tricycle was reputed to be 3½hp. The manufacturer said the car had &quot;practically the control of one of the largest and best-equipped plants of American Automotive Machinery.&quot; The tiller-steered car, which could carry &quot;two or three persons, or four children&quot;, cost £59.

<text>ASA (&quot;Autocostruzioni Società per Azioni&quot;) was an Italian automobile manufacturer active from 1961 to 1969, who is known for manufacturing the ASA 1000 GT. This car was developed by Ferrari engineers in the late 1950s as a less expensive, compact alternative to existing Ferrari GT cars. ASA used inline-four and straight-six engines derived from the &quot;250&quot; 3-litre V12 designed by Gioacchino Colombo. The chassis was developed by Giotto Bizzarrini and was derived from the tubular frame chassis of the 250 GTO.

The prototype that would become the ASA 1000 GT was first presented by Carrozzeria Bertone (Geneva 1961) under the name &quot;Mille&quot;. Following this debut in late 1961, Enzo Ferrari decided to not sell the new car as a Ferrari and entrusted production to a close friend, Oronzio de Nora. The car was manufactured in Milan by a newly formed company called ASA (owned by the De Nora Electrochemical Group) from 1964 to 1969. The 1000 GT model was officially introduced in 1962, but due to production difficulties series production did not begin until 1964.

== ASA 1000 GT ==

=== Design and development by Ferrari ===
The ASA 1000 GT originated in a late 1950s experimental project by Ferrari engineers to create a less expensive, compact alternative to existing Ferrari GT cars. This project was designated &quot;854&quot; by the factory (for 850cc, 4 cylinders), however it was commonly but unofficially named &quot;Ferrarina,&quot; meaning &quot;Little Ferrari.&quot;

The &quot;Ferrarina&quot; engine was derived from a late 1950s experimental inline-4, designated Tipo 122. This was basically a four-cylinder, slice of a Colombo V12 from a Ferrari 212, with a bore and stroke of 65 x 64mm and supplied by two Weber 38DCO carburetors. The Tipo 122 engine produced at 7000 rpm. The Tipo 122 was followed by the more powerful and slightly higher displacement Tipo 125 and 126 engines. The Tipo 126 engine displaced 973 cc and produced at 7000 rpm. These engines were tested in the &quot;Ferrarina&quot; prototype, a 2-door notchback coupe on a Fiat 1100 or 1200 chassis with a Pininfarina body, which was used by Enzo Ferrari as his personal transportation for some time in the late 1950s. The final engine design was completed in 1960 as the Tipo 141, with 1032cc displacement, bore and stroke of 69 mm x 69 mm, a single overhead cam and two Weber 38DCOA carburetors. According to Ferrari&#x27;s records, this engine produced at 7200 rpm with a 9:1 compression ratio.

Following Ferrari&#x27;s development work on the 854/&quot;Ferrarina&quot; prototype, a new prototype called the &quot;Mille&quot; (&quot;one thousand&quot; in Italian) was shown at the 1961 Turin Auto Show on the Bertone stand. The Mille was an entirely new car based on the 854 project, with 2-door fastback coupé bodywork designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Bertone. Although this prototype had no Ferrari badging, its design echoed contemporary Ferrari GT models and the origin of the design within Ferrari was well publicized. Despite positive publicity and official support of the project from Ferrari, at the time of the Mille&#x27;s debut there were no plans for Ferrari to mass-produce the design. Ferrari engineers had planned around annual production of 3000-5000 cars, which would sell for approximately US$2600 each. Not only was the Ferrari factory inadequate for this kind of volume production, Enzo Ferrari was unwilling to expand it in order to produce the Mille. Even before the Turin debut of the Mille, Ferrari had begun searching for another company that would buy the design and bring it to market.

=== Formation of ASA and 1000 GT production ===
By 1962, Enzo Ferrari decided to entrust production of the Ferrarina to close friend Oronzio de Nora and his son, Niccolò de Nora. The de Nora Electrochemical Group formed a new company for this purpose under the name ASA (&quot;Autocostruzioni Società per Azioni&quot;). ASA operations were headed by Niccolò de Nora. Also involved in ASA management were race drivers Lorenzo Bandini, Gerino Gerini, and Giancarlo Baghetti and engineer Giotto Bizzarrini. The new firm had its headquarters on via San Faustino in Milan.

The ASA 1000 GT production version, almost unchanged from the &quot;Mille&quot; prototype, was officially introduced at the 1962 Turin Auto Show. Despite this debut, due to production difficulties series production of the 1000 GT did not begin until 1964. The production 1000 GT used the 1032cc Tipo 141 I4 engine fitted with 40DCOE9 carburetors. It produced a stated at 6800 rpm, a HP/Litre ratio better than the contemporary Ferrari 275 GTB. Other sources report an output of at 7000 rpm. Production cars used a tubular spaceframe chassis designed by Giotto Bizzarrini, based on the 250 GTO. It was equipped with double wishbone front suspension and a live axle at the rear. Both front and rear of the car were equipped with coil springs, tubular dampers, an anti-roll bar and disk brakes. The coupe was bodied in steel with aluminum hood and trunk lids and weighed dry. Autocar magazine tested the 1000 GT shortly after its introduction and recorded a 0-60 mph time of 14.0 seconds and a 1/4 mile run in 19.3 seconds.

At least two fiberglass-bodied convertibles were also produced. One of the convertibles was displayed at the 1962 Turin auto show alongside the coupe. Other than the fiberglass body, the convertible was mechanically identical to the 1000 GT coupe.

=== Commercial reception ===
The first production ASA 1000 GT couple was sold for $5920 in September 1964. Luigi Chinetti was the sole US importer of ASA and a majority of the 1000 GT production was sent to his dealership. Despite reportedly excellent driving dynamics and reliability, 1000 GT sales were low. The brand had little name recognition and Chinetti&#x27;s American customers in particular preferred the much more powerful Ferraris. Additionally, the 1000 GT was extremely expensive for the performance offered, with retail prices around US$6000 when a new Chevrolet Corvette equipped with a much more powerful 427 c.i. V8 engine cost US$4500. In order to sell their stock of ASAs, Chinetti&#x27;s dealership steadily lowered prices during the late 1960s and early 1970s. A new 1000 GT sold for $1800 in 1973, far below cost.

ASA production never achieved the anticipated volume of 3000-5000 cars per year. Even when series production was fully operational during 1964 and 1965, only one car was built per week. Exact production figures are unknown, but sources agree that less than 100 ASA cars of all types were constructed. One source estimates that 50-75 1000 GTs were produced in total between 1964 and 1967, with an additional handful of convertibles and competition cars. The ASA factory officially closed in 1967, but some cars were assembled from spare parts and sold as new up through the early 1970s.

== Competition cars ==
The ASA 1000 GTC was a sports racing car built in 1963 by Giotto Bizzarrini and based on a production 1000 GT. The car was developed under a newly-founded Società Autostar workshop. The body was designed and built by Piero Drogo&#x27;s Carrozzeria Sports Cars. The engine had its displacement reduced to 995 cc to meet the under 1.0-litre racing classification. The tubular chassis with aluminium body saved the weight to a total of . Bizzarrini and Drogo also built a larger displacement car called 1300 GTC with 1.3-litre engine that debuted at the 1966 Trento-Bondone Hill Climb.

The ASA Berlinetta 411 was the competition version of the 1000 GT Coupé, introduced at the 1965 Paris Motor Show. It used the engine from the 1000 GT enlarged to by increasing the cylinder bore from 69 to 71 mm. This engine produced at 7500 rpm. The Berlinetta 411 had a lightweight all-aluminum body and plexiglass windows, resulting in a dry weight of compared to the regular 1000 GT&#x27;s . Other modifications included wider tires and a competition gas filler. The exact number produced is unknown. Two competition 1000 GTs were entered in the 1965 Targa Florio. They placed 17th and 22nd overall, 3rd and 4th place in the 1000-1600cc prototype class.

ASA also manufactured four fiberglass-bodied competition cars called the RB613 or Roll Bar 1300. These featured a more aerodynamic body designed by Luigi Chinetti Jr. and manufactured by Carrozzeria Corbetta. The chassis had an integrated roll bar, the source of the &quot;RB&quot; abbreviation in the name. The engine was a 1.3 liter straight-six, the design based on 1/2 of the Ferrari 250 V12. Two ASA RB613s were raced at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, one an ASA factory entry and one entered by Luigi Chinetti&#x27;s North American Racing Team. Neither car finished the race. NART entered another RB613 in the 1967 Daytona 24 Hours. Driven by Suzy Dietrich and Donna Mae Mims, the ASA finished 24th. The same driver team again drove the ASA for NART in the 1967 Sebring 12 Hours, finishing 25th.

A similar 1.8 liter 4-cylinder RB618 or Roll Bar 1800 competition model was developed for the American market. The quantity produced and racing history of this model is unknown.

<doc id="858094" wikidata="Q721047" url="?curid=858094" title="Asardo">
<text>Asardo is a brand of sports car built in the United States. The first car was built in 1959 and subsequently modified by the designer in 1961. Only one was ever built.

==Background==
&quot;Asardo&quot; is an acronym for &quot;American Special Automotive Research and Design Organization&quot;. The company&#x27;s founder and chief designer was mechanical engineer Helmut Schlosser, an Austrian who had emigrated to the United States. In the late 1950s he was managing a machine shop in North Bergen, New Jersey. Schlosser was interested in sports cars, at one time owning a Siata with a Stanguellini engine.

Schlosser had completed the design for what would become the Asardo by 1957, and construction began in 1958.

==1500 AR-S==
For the Asardo 1500 AR-S Schlosser produced a compact curvaceous berlinetta body in fiberglass. The appearance of the front of the car has been compared to the Maserati 300S and the rear to some Ferraris. The car&#x27;s gullwing doors were reminiscent of the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and in fact used Mercedes hinges and latches with a custom hold-up strut. The dashboard was from a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia as was the windshield, which was cut to fit. The bucket seats were from a Porsche Speedster. The electrical accessories were courtesy of Lucas.

The chassis was a multi-tubular space frame. The front suspension used upper and lower A-arms from the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, coil springs and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension also used many Giulietta parts, with a solid axle and alloy Alfa differential carrier on coil springs with trailing arms and an A-arm for lateral location. Koni telescopic shock-absorbers were used all four corners, as were Borrani wire wheels with knock-off spinners. Brakes were Girling/Alfa Romeo drums front and Alfin drums rear. Steering was the ZF-Gemmer worm-and-ball system used in the Alfas.

The engine in the Asardo 1500 AR-S was the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam straight-four engine. In the Giulietta this engine displaced but for the Asardo its bore was increased from 74 mm to 79.5 mm with custom pistons and wet liners from Mahle so that its final displacement was . The Asardo&#x27;s engine had a compression ratio of 11.5:1 and was equipped with two two-barrel Weber 40mm DCOE3 carburetors. Power output for the engine was estimated to have been at 6800 rpm. Power went from the engine to the rear axle through an Alfa Romeo four-speed manual transmission.

The car was taken to the Lime Rock track, where driver Dolph Vilardi recorded lap times of 1 minute 16 seconds even though the engine mixture was too lean and only three-quarter throttle was used. Top speed was estimated to be .

The Asardo debuted at the 1959 New York auto show. It was listed at a suggested price of US$5875.00 and was to be built at a rate of two cars per month in a new production facility in Weehawken, New Jersey. Schlosser and his financial backers disagreed about how the car would be sold. The financiers wanted to offer the Asardo as a partially completed car that allowed the buyer to choose their engine while Schlosser insisted that the car be sold complete with the Alfa engine. They parted ways over the difference and Schlosser went to Europe in search of alternate financing.

==3500 GM-S==
Schlosser spent most of 1960 searching unsuccessfully for new backers. When he returned to the United States late that year former New York Giant turned auto dealer and racing driver Charlie Kolb with Florida VW/Porsche dealer Overkey Motors engaged Schlosser to redesign the Asardo to accept the Buick &quot;215&quot; aluminum V8 then under development at General Motors. Schlosser redesigned the chassis to make room for the new engine but kept the same body. The Buick engine and a Corvette transmission were installed in the car. Schlosser had designed an independent suspension system for the rear of the car but did not have the opportunity to install it, so the Alfa differential remained. The revised Asardo was renamed the 3500 GM-S.

==In competition and later history==
Vilardi raced the car in 1959 and was able to post a third place in the Montgomery preliminary on August 8 and a fourth place at the Lime Rock preliminary on October 17. After this Kolb made some track appearances.

At various times the car has been owned by collectors in the United States, Japan, Germany and Spain. The Buick V8 has also been replaced with a 1600cc Alfa Romeo engine. The original 1500cc engine is reported to have languished behind an Alfa dealer in California for several years before being sold.

==Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ controversy==
In his 2002 book &quot;Alfa Romeo TZ - Zagato Autodelta Conrero&quot;, author, racing driver and classic car dealer Philippe Olczyk suggested that the Asardo had strongly influenced the design of the Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ sports racer and that the car could be viewed as the first unofficial TZ prototype. Many in the motoring press and Alfa enthusiast community reacted with skepticism, pointing to significant differences between the cars.

<text>A salt lake or saline lake is a landlocked body of water that has a concentration of salts (typically sodium chloride) and other dissolved minerals significantly higher than most lakes (often defined as at least three grams of salt per liter). In some cases, salt lakes have a higher concentration of salt than sea water; such lakes can also be termed hypersaline lake, and may also be pink lakes on account of their color. An alkalic salt lake that has a high content of carbonate is sometimes termed a soda lake.

Salt lakes are classified according to salinity levels. The formation of these lakes is influenced by processes such as evaporation and deposition. Salt lakes face serious conservation challenges due to climate change, pollution and water diversion.

The primary method of classification for salt lakes involves assessing the chemical composition of the water within the lakes, specifically its salinity, pH, and the dominant ions present.

=== Subsaline ===
Subsaline lakes have a salinity lower than that of seawater but higher than freshwater, typically ranging from 0.5 to 3 grams per liter (g/L).

=== Hyposaline ===
Hyposaline lakes exhibit salinities from 3 to 20 g/L, which allows for the presence of freshwater species along with some salt-tolerant aquatic organisms. Lake Alchichica in Mexico is a hyposaline lake.

=== Mesosaline ===
Mesosaline lakes have a salinity level ranging from 20 to 50 g/L. An example of a mesosaline lake is Redberry Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada.

=== Hypersaline ===
Hypersaline lakes possess salinities greater than 35 g/L, or 50 g/L, often exceeding 200 g/L. The extreme salinity levels create harsh conditions that limit the diversity of life, primarily supporting specialized organisms such as halophilic bacteria and certain species of brine shrimp. These lakes can have high concentrations of sodium salts and minerals, such as lithium, making such lakes vulnerable to mining interests. Hypersaline lakes can be found in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, where salinity can reach ≈440‰. 
== Formation ==
Salt lakes form through complex chemical, geological, and biological processes, influenced by environmental conditions like high evaporation rates and restricted water outflow. As water carrying dissolved minerals (sodium, potassium, and magnesium) enters these basins, it gradually evaporates, concentrating these minerals until they precipitate as salt deposits. Then, specific ions interact under controlled temperatures, which leads to solid-solution formation and salt crystal deposition within the lake bed. This cycle of evaporation and deposition is the main process to the unique saline environment that characterizes a salt lake.Environmental factors further shape the composition and formation of salt lakes. Seasonal variations in temperature and evaporation drive mineral saturation and promote salt crystallization. In dry regions, water loss during warmer seasons concentrates the lake&#x27;s salts. This creates a dynamic environment where seasonal shifts affect the salt lake&#x27;s mineral layers, contributing to its evolving structure and composition. Groundwater rich in dissolved ions often serve as primary mineral sources that, combined with processes like evaporation and deposition, contribute to salt lake development. 

== Biodiversity ==

Salt lakes host a diverse range of animals, despite high levels of salinity acting as significant environmental constraints. Increased salinity worsens oxygen levels and thermal conditions, raising the water&#x27;s density and viscosity, which demands greater energy for animal movement. Despite these challenges, salt lakes support biota adapted to such conditions with specialized physiological and biochemical mechanisms. Common salt lake invertebrates include various parasites, with around 85 parasite species found in saline waters, including crustaceans and monogeneans. Among them, the filter-feeding brine shrimp plays a crucial role as a keystone species by regulating phytoplankton and bacterioplankton levels. The Artemia species also serves as an intermediate host for helminth parasites that affect migratory water birds like flamingos, grebes, gulls, shorebirds, and ducks. Vertebrates in saline lakes include certain fish and bird species, though they are sensitive to fluctuations in salinity. Many saline lakes are also alkaline, which imposes physiological challenges for fish, especially in managing nitrogenous waste excretion. Fish species vary by lake; for instance, the Salton Sea is home to species such as carp, striped mullet, humpback sucker, and rainbow trout.

== Stratification ==

Stratification in salt lakes occurs as a result of the unique chemical and environmental processes that cause water to separate into layers based on density. In these lakes, high rates of evaporation often concentrate salts, leading to denser, saltier water sinking to the lake&#x27;s bottom, while fresher water remains nearer the surface. These seasonal changes influence the lake&#x27;s structure, making stratification more pronounced during warmer months due to increasing evaporation, which drives separation between saline and fresher layers in the lake, leading a phenomenon known as meromixis (meromictic state), primarily prevents oxygen from penetrating the deeper layers and create the hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) zones. This separation eventually influenced the lake&#x27;s chemistry, supporting only specialized microbial life adapted to extreme environments with high salinity and low oxygen levels. The restricted vertical mixing limits nutrient cycling, creating a favorable ecosystem for halophiles (salt-loving organisms) that rely on these saline conditions for stability and balance.

The extreme conditions within stratified salt lakes have a profound effect on aquatic life, as oxygen levels are severely limited due to the lack of vertical mixing. Extremophiles, including specific bacteria and archaea, inhabit the hypersaline and oxygen-deficient zones at lower depths. Bacteria and archaea, for example, rely on alternative metabolic processes that do not depend on oxygen. These microorganisms play a critical role in nutrient cycling within salt lakes, as they break down organic material and release by-products that support other microbial communities. Due to limited biodiversity, the restrictive environment limits biodiversity, allowing only specially adapted life forms to survive, which creates unique, highly specialized ecosystems that are distinct from freshwater or less saline habitats.

== Conservation ==
Salt lakes declined worldwide in recent years. The Aral Sea, once of the largest saline lakes with a surface area of 67,499 km in 1960, diminished to approximately 6,990 km in 2016. This trend is not limited to the Aral Sea; salt lakes around the world are shrinking due to excessive water diversion, dam construction, pollution, urbanization, and rising temperatures associated with climate change. The resulting declines cause severe disruptions to local ecosystems and biodiversity, degrades the environment, threatens economic stability, and displaces communities dependent on these lakes for resources and livelihood.

In Utah, if the Great Salt Lake is not conserved, the state could face potential economic and public health crises, with consequences for air quality, local agriculture, and wildlife. According to &quot;Utah’s Great Salt Lake Strike Team&quot;, in order to increase the lake&#x27;s level within the next 30 years, average inflows must increase by 472,00 acre-feet per year. This is approximately 33% more than the amount that has been reaching the lake in recent years.

Water conservation is viewed as being the most cost-effective and practical strategy to save salt lakes like the Great Salt Lake. Implementing strong water management policies, improving community awareness, and ensuring the return of water flow to these lakes are additional ways that may restore ecological balance. Other proposed methods of maintaining lake levels include cloud seeding and the mitigation of dust transmission hotspots.

<text>The Ascort was an automobile manufactured by Continental Coachwork of Sydney, Australia from 1958 to 1960.

Designated as the Ascort-TSV-1300 G.T., it utilized a mildly modified Volkswagen chassis fitted with a four-seat coupé body which was based on that of the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupé, although significantly different in appearance. The body, which was constructed of fibreglass, had a prestressed double shell with a bonded-in light steel tubular frame, and was mounted on an 11-inch rubber seal. The 1.3-litre Volkswagen flat-4 engine was modified using Okrasa and Porsche components to produce 54 bhp at 4300 rpm. The vehicle&#x27;s total weight was 1467 lb, 33% less than that of a standard Volkswagen Beetle sedan. The Ascort had a top speed of 96 mph and could accelerate from zero to 50 mph in 12.0 seconds.

19 cars were built before production was terminated. Although there were plans to offer the car with a 70 hp, 1500 cc engine, which would have given the car a top speed of well over 100 mph, this variant was never produced.

<text>Inorganic ions in animals and plants are ions necessary for vital cellular activity. In body tissues, ions are also known as electrolytes, essential for the electrical activity needed to support muscle contractions and neuron activation. They contribute to osmotic pressure of body fluids as well as performing a number of other important functions. Below is a list of some of the most important ions for living things as well as examples of their functions:

* Ca2+calcium ions are a component of bones and teeth. They also function as biological messengers, as do most of the ions listed below. (See Hypocalcaemia.)
*Zn2+ - zinc ions are found in very small concentrations in the body, and their main purpose is that of an antioxidant; the zinc ions act as antioxidants both generally and for liver specific pro-oxidants. Zinc ions can also act as an antioxidant-like stabilizer for some macro-molecules which bind zinc ions with high affinity, especially in cysteine-rich binding sites. These binding sites use these zinc ions as a stabilizer to protein folds, making these protein motifs more rigid in structure. These structures include zinc fingers, and have several different conformations.
* K+potassium ions&#x27; main function in animals is osmotic balance, particularly in the kidneys. (See Hypokalemia.)
* Na+sodium ions have a similar role to potassium ions. (See Sodium deficiency.)
*Mn2+- manganese ions are seen being used as stabilizer for varying protein configurations. However, manganese ion overexposure is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
* Mg2+ magnesium ions are a component of chlorophyll. (See Magnesium deficiency (plants))
* Cl− inability to transport chloride ions in humans manifests itself as cystic fibrosis (CF)
*  the shells of sea creatures are calcium carbonate. In blood approximately 85% of carbon dioxide, is converted into aqueous carbonate ions (an acidic solution), allowing a greater rate of transportation.
*Co2+- cobalt ions are present in the human body in amounts from 1 to 2 mg. Cobalt is observed in the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen, and considerably smaller quantities in the pancreas, brain, and serum. Cobalt is a necessary component of vitamin B12 and a fundamental coenzyme of cell mitosis. Cobalt is crucial for amino acid formation and some proteins to create myelin sheath in nerve cells. Cobalt also plays a role in creating neurotransmitters, which are vital for proper function within the organism.
* adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a common molecule which stores energy in an accessible form. Bone is calcium phosphate.
* Fe2+/Fe3+as found in haemoglobin, the main oxygen carrying molecule has a central iron ion.
*  source of nitrogen in plants for the synthesis of proteins.

==Biological functions of inorganic ions==

===Ion channels===

====K+ channels====
Potassium ion channels play a key role in maintaining the membrane&#x27;s electric potential. These ion channels are present in many various biological systems. They frequently play a role in regulation of cellular level processes, many of these processes including muscle relaxation, hypertension, insulin secretion etc. Some examples of potassium ion channels within biological systems include KATP channels, BK channels, and ether-a-go-go potassium channels

====Na+ channels====
Sodium ion channels provide an integral service through the body, as they transmit depolarizing impulses at the cellular and intracellular level. This allows sodium ions to coordinate much more intensive processes such as movement and cognition. Sodium ion channels consist of various subunits, however, only the principle subunit is required for function. These sodium ion channels consist of four internally homologous domains, each of which containing six transmembrane segments and resembling a single subunit of a voltage-dependent potassium ion channel. The four domains fold together, forming a central pore. That central pore of the sodium ions dictates the selectivity of the channel: both ionic radius and ionic charge are key in channel selectivity.

====Cl− channels====
Chloride ion channels vary from many other ion channels due to being controlled by the anionic chloride ions. Chloride ion channels are pore-forming membrane proteins that allow the passive transport of chloride ions across biological membranes. Chloride ion channels involve both voltage-gated and ligand-gated mechanisms to transport the ions across cellular membranes. Chloride ion channels have been found to play crucial roles in the development of human diseases, for example, mutations in the genes encoding chloride ion channels lead to a variety of deleterious diseases in muscle, kidney, bone, and brain, including cystic fibrosis, osteoporosis, and epilepsy, and similarly their activation is supposed to be responsible for the progression of glioma in the brain and the growth of malaria-parasite in the red blood cells. Currently, chloride ion channels are not completely understood, and more research is necessary.

<text>James J. LeBar (May 19, 1936 – February 21, 2008) was a Roman Catholic priest who was the chief exorcist of the Archdiocese of New York in the United States.

== Early career ==
LeBar was ordained in 1962. He was assigned as chaplain to Hudson Valley Psychiatric Center in 1982 and served until his retirement there in 2005. Previously, he was a parochial vicar at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Poughkeepsie from 1980 to 1982; St. Stanislaus, Pleasant Valley from 1979 to 1980; St. Catherine Laboure, Lake Katrine from 1973 to 1979 and from 1965 to 1967; St. Joseph&#x27;s, Kingston from 1967 to 1973; St. Gregory Barbarigo, Garnerville in 1967; and St. John the Evangelist, White Plains from 1962 to 1965. He served briefly as administrator of St. Colman&#x27;s, East Kingston, and Holy Name of Jesus, Kingston.

He taught religion at John A. Coleman Catholic High School from 1966 to 1970. In the 1970s, LeBar was asked to become part of the Office of Communications of the Archdiocese of New York which at the time was dealing with the rise of groups they called &quot;cults&quot; and occult activity. In 1976, he was one of the priest advisors who supported the National Catholic Committee on Scouting&#x27;s attendance with a Scout Service Corps at the 41st International Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia and attended that event. He performed his first exorcisms in 1988 and 1989. In 1989, he published his book &quot;Cults, Sects, and the New Age&quot;. He counseled many former &quot;cult members&quot; and was a frequent speaker on this subject. He appeared as a guest on the Geraldo Rivera special &quot;Devil Worship Exposing Satan&#x27;s Underground&quot;, which aired on October 22, 1988.

== Exorcist of the Archdiocese of New York ==
He first came to prominence in 1991 when he took part in an exorcism in Palm Beach, Florida, broadcast on the television program &quot;20/20&quot;. He was appointed the chief exorcist of New York in 1992, by Cardinal John Joseph O&#x27;Connor. On June 25, 1995, LeBar was one of the guests on the Geraldo Rivera television program exploring satanic ritual abuse.

When asked during an interview if he ever witnessed levitation during an exorcism, he said &quot;I myself, have never seen a major levitation in the course of an exorcism. However, in one case in the preliminary investigation, I had a person who rose up above the pews of the church and was suspended there for a few minutes.&quot;

He told &quot;Spirit Daily&quot; at the time of the 25th anniversary release of the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; that it &quot;is about the most accurate portrayal of what can happen at an exorcism that I have ever seen.&quot;

Actress Winona Ryder spoke with LeBar about exorcisms in 1999 in order to prepare for her film role in the movie &quot;Lost Souls&quot; in which LeBar was one of the consultants. He allowed her to view some videotapes of exorcisms he had performed. Performance artist Linda Montano has done work related to LeBar posthumously.

In July 2002, LeBar addressed a conference of Roman Catholic exorcists in Rome. He lived and worked in New York State and was assigned as chaplain of the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie, New York, a post he has held for almost 20 years.

== Death ==
LeBar died of heart failure on the morning of February 21, 2008 at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, NY. According to friends and colleagues, he was admitted to St. Francis and diagnosed with a bacterial infection which became septic. He was placed in intensive care and placed on a ventilator until he died of heart failure.

LeBar was buried from Regina Coeli Parish in Hyde Park, New York where he was in residence for nearly the last 25 years, especially while he served during most of that time as priest-chaplain to the Hudson Valley Psychiatric Center. His body lay in-state at the church, where visitation were held on Sunday, February 24 in the afternoon and evening; the Mass of Christian Burial was concelebrated with one of the auxiliary bishops of New York on Monday, February 25, at 10:00.

According to a colleague of LeBar: &quot;For those of us who knew and worked with him, were served or mentored by him, we are trying with God’s grace to come to terms with this loss, both personally and for the Church in America. I have often remarked about Father’s disarmingly dry sense of humor—a hallmark of the same man who at times directly addressed and expelled demonic forces. A friend asked yesterday &#x27;I wonder what Father LeBar will say when he sees God the Father?&#x27; I have no doubt that his sincere but usually witty response, along with his slight Bronx accent, will be something like &#x27;Well—you do look better in person&#x27;&quot;.

== Posthumous ==

On April 26, 2019, the Archdiocese of New York published an &quot;Update on the Sexual Abuse Crisis&quot; which included LeBar in its list of clergy who were not&#x27; found to have been credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor, but for whom &quot;the IRCP’s independent administrators have determined that claims against them were eligible for compensation.&quot; The list notes that &quot;A determination by the IRCP that a claim is eligible for compensation is not equivalent to a finding by a judge or jury that a clergy member is liable for sexual abuse of a minor under civil or criminal law.&quot;

<doc id="858106" wikidata="Q5100398" url="?curid=858106" title="Chinese Canadian National Council">
<text>The Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) (), known in the Chinese-Canadian community as Equal Rights Council (平權會), is an organization whose purpose is to promote equity, social justice, inclusive civic participation, and respect for diversity. The first CCNC in Ontario was founded in 1980. 

In 1985, CCNCTO was founded. They continue to operate today, serving Chinese Canadian community members in the Greater Toronto Area.

In 2019, CCNC-SJ was founded to monitor racial discrimination in Canada and to help young Chinese Canadians learn about their cultural history.

Today, CCNCTO and CCNCSJ are completely separate organizations with different governance bodies, staff, membership and volunteers. They both continue to operate in the Greater Toronto Area.

== History ==
The organization was created in 1980, after an incident in September 1979 when the CTV Television Network incorrectly represented Chinese Canadians in an investigative show called &quot;W5&quot;. In a feature called &quot;Campus Giveaways&quot;, CTV used allegedly incorrect statistics to conclude that foreign students were eroding other Canadians&#x27; opportunities for a secondary education and benefitting from public universities funded by Canadian taxpayers. &quot;All&quot; Chinese university students were treated as foreign students, regardless of their real nationality. The show also made numerous racial remarks about the Chinese students. The incident and the resulting campaign were reported in the Canadian media.

In response, Chinese communities across Canada staged protests against CTV and forced the President of CTV to publicly apologize for the &quot;W5&quot; feature. After the incident, Chinese who protested against CTV across Canada staged a meeting in Toronto. The meeting called for a stronger voice representing Chinese Canadians nationwide, thus the CCNC was formed. By 1980, the organization had developed nationwide presence with twenty-eight chapters. The United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.) was accepted as a voting member in 1989.

== Advocacy history ==
Since the formation of the CCNC, it has spoken out against racial discrimination against Chinese in Canada. The CCNC is also involved in controversial issues concerning Chinese in Canada, like forcing the Government of Canada to apologize and redress the head tax that Chinese had to paid from 1885 to 1923.

On November 28, 2005, the Toronto chapter of the CCNC (CCNCTO) was granted the William P. Hubbard Award for Race Relations by the Toronto city government, in recognition of the CCNC&#x27;s advocacy for Head Tax redress.

In 2012, the CCNC-SJ criticized the Bank of Canada for removing an image of an Asian Canadian from a proposed design for the $100 banknote and condemned the bank for listening to &#x27;racist comments and feedback from the focus group&#x27; of its bank note design. The Bank of Canada later apologized to the CCNC-SJ&#x27;s executive director Victor Wong.

Today, CCNCTO and CCNC-SJ both continue to do advocacy work to advance the rights of Chinese Canadians.

The southern terminus of I-279 is at I-376 in Downtown Pittsburgh. It runs concurrently with U.S. Route 19 Truck (US 19 Truck) from its southern terminus to exit 4. (US 19 Truck continues on I-376 west.) I-279 crosses the Fort Duquesne Bridge over the Allegheny River, providing easy access to Heinz Field and PNC Park. I-579 intersects I-279 but is only accessible by southbound traffic; likewise, traffic from I-579 can only head northbound on I-279 by the I-279 Interchange. I-279 features two reversible high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes), which begin in and near downtown and end at exit 5, an interchange with US 19. The road becomes more suburban and rural as it continues to head north. It has two additional interchanges, Bellevue/West View and Camp Horne Road. After Camp Horne Road, there are no exits until its terminus later. The Interstate terminates at its parent, I-79. Like the interchange with I-579, this is also a partial interchange. Traffic on I-279 is only permitted to exit northbound on I-79, while only traffic heading southbound on I-79 can exit on to I-279 south.

The section from exit 1B to exit 2B is also known as the North Shore Expressway.

== History ==
I-279 was first proposed in 1958 to run along what is now I-79 between the current I-376 in Carnegie and the current I-279 in Franklin Park. On October 2, 1972, its route was swapped with I-79, putting I-279 onto its current route, although only the downtown portion and the Fort Duquesne Bridge were built at the time.

In 1973, the designation was extended from downtown over Parkway West (what is now I-376) to I-79. This section became part of I-376 in 2009, and the I-279 signs were taken down there.

I-279 from Fort Duquesne Bridge to its current northern terminus in Franklin Park was approved on June 4, 1975, but constructed from 1985 to 1989, opening in its entirety with a Governor Bob Casey Sr. ribbon-cutting on September 16, 1989. From 1997 to 2003, various ramps, the Fort Pitt Bridge, and nearby tunnels were reconstructed. A direct connection from I-279 south to I-376 east was opened in 2002.

A tragedy occurred on the reversible HOV lanes in 1995 when a negligent highway worker failed to close the outbound gates, leading to a head-on collision that killed six. In 2006, to help prevent a repeat of this incident, automatic &quot;&quot;fast-acting&quot; gates&quot; were activated at the southern entrances to these HOV lanes in Downtown Pittsburgh.

=== Unearthed cemetery ===
During the last phases of construction of I-279 in 1987, a long-forgotten cemetery dating from the 19th century was unearthed near the site of the current I-279/I-579 split. Archeologists spent four months exhuming the graves for cultural studies at the Smithsonian Institution, putting the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) significantly behind schedule. It was determined that the graves belonged to Swiss and German immigrants that were members of a local church located next door to the cemetery in what was then Allegheny City, with 727 graves buried at the site between 1833 and 1861. The graves were forgotten about by 1911 when the church did an addition to the building and had the foundation unintentionally go through about 15 graves, with the churchyard housing the cemetery later becoming a parking lot in 1950. Aside from a pair of stillborn twins, none of the graves were identified, and archeologists were unable to find any living descendants due to the obscurity of the cemetery. The remains were reburied with one marker at the church&#x27;s current cemetery in the Troy Hill section of Pittsburgh in 2003 after the Smithsonian Institution finished studying them; the congregation itself disbanded in 1984 after PennDOT bought the church property via eminent domain for I-279 and only had 21 members at that point. Today, it is the largest number of 19th century graves (Native American graves notwithstanding) ever studied archeologically in the US.

<text>Livingstone Falls (French: &quot;Chutes Livingstone&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Livingstonewatervallen&quot;), named for British explorer David Livingstone, are a succession of enormous rapids on the lower course of the Congo River in west equatorial Africa, downstream from Malebo Pool in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

==Description==
Livingstone Falls consist of a series of rapids dropping in . They start downstream of Malebo Pool and end in Matadi in Bas-Congo. The Congo River has the second largest flow rate in the world after the Amazon, which has no falls or rapids (except near its sources). The lowest rapids of Livingstone Falls, therefore, are the world&#x27;s largest waterfall in terms of flow rate — provided one accepts these rapids as being a waterfall. An interesting aspect of the Livingstone Falls is the width of the channel. The channel is very narrow: in several stretches the channel width is less than 300 metres and for the majority of the length the channel is less than 800 metres wide. This is an extraordinarily narrow channel since the river flow rate typically exceeds . Investigations in 2008 and 2009 showed that sections between the rapids may be as deep as . The powerful rapids separate fish populations from one another, causing new species to evolve in close proximity to one another.

==History==
Although he explored the upper Congo, Livingstone never travelled to this part of the river and the falls were named in his honour by Henry Morton Stanley. Stanley described the falls as &quot;...the wildest stretch of river that I have ever seen. Take a strip of sea blown over by a hurricane, four miles in length and half a mile in breadth, and a pretty accurate conception of its leaping waves may be obtained. Some of the troughs were 100 yards in length, and from one to the other the mad river plunged. There was first a rush down into the bottom of an immense trough, and then, by its sheer force, the enormous volume would lift itself upward steeply until, gathering itself into a ridge, it suddenly hurled itself 20 or 30 feet straight upward, before rolling down into another trough. If I looked up or down along this angry scene, every interval of 50 or 100 yards of it was marked by wave-towers - their collapse into foam and spray, the mad clash of watery hills, bounding mounds and heaving billows, while the base of either bank, consisting of a long line of piled boulders of massive size, was buried in the tempestuous surf. The roar was tremendous and deafening. I can only compare it to the thunder of an express train through a rock tunnel.&quot;Since the falls, which start with the Yellala Falls just above Matadi, are a barrier to navigation on the lower part of the river, the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway was constructed to by-pass them.

==&quot;Grand Inga&quot; proposed hydroelectric project==
Inga Falls on Congo River is a group of rapids in the latter portion of the Livingstone Falls, after the Malebo Pool. The Congo falls about 96 metres within this set of . The mean annual flow rate at Inga Falls is about 42,000 cubic metres per second. Given this flow rate and the 96 metre fall, it is possible to calculate that the Inga Falls alone has a power potential of approximately 40 GW.

In 2014, Inga Falls was the site of two large hydro-electric power plants and is being considered for a much larger hydro-electric power generating station known as Grand Inga. The Grand Inga project, if completed, would be the largest hydro-electric power generating facility on Earth. The current project scope calls for the use of a flow rate 26,400 cubic metres per second at a net head of 150 metres; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of about 38.9 GW. This hydro-electric generator would be almost double the current world record holder, which is the Three Gorges facility at 22.5GW on the Yangtze River in China.

<text>Vril: The Power of the Coming Race, originally published as &quot;The Coming Race&quot;, is a novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, published anonymously in 1871.
Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean master race and the energy-form called &quot;Vril&quot;, at least in part; some theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part. One 1960 book, &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot; by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels, suggested that a secret Vril Society existed in Weimar Berlin.

The name &quot;Vril&quot; may be based on the word , as has repeatedly been suggested.

==History==
The original (British edition) titled as &quot;The Coming Race&quot; was published anonymously in May 1871 by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London. (Blackwood published four more &quot;editions&quot; in 1871.) Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August 1871 as &quot;The Coming Race or The New Utopia ,&quot; by Francis B. Felt &amp; Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark &amp; Co. in Toronto, respectively. &quot;Erewhon&quot;, which was published anonymously in March 1872, was initially assumed to be a sequel to &quot;The Coming Race&quot;, which by then Bulwer-Lytton was known to have written. When it was revealed that Samuel Butler was the author of &quot;Erewhon&quot; in the 25 May 1872 issue of the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, sales dropped by 90 percent.

==Plot summary==

A young, independent, wealthy traveller (the narrator) visits a friend, a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host&#x27;s wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift dictionary during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language.

The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taë behave kindly towards him.

The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended houses 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society is a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an &quot;all-permeating fluid&quot; called &quot;Vril&quot;, a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depends on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gives them access to an extraordinary force that can be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employ to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril include the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular are immense, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.

Men (called An, pronounced &quot;Arn&quot;) and women (called Gy, pronounced &quot;Gee&quot;) have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party in romantic relationships. They marry for three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry.

Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.

The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. The guide&#x27;s daughter, Zee, falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taë to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taë and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.

==Vril in the novel==

The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator&#x27;s host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.

A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with &quot;stops&quot;, &quot;keys&quot;, or &quot;springs&quot; in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user&#x27;s preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised.

==Literary significance and reception==

The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word &quot;Vril&quot; came to be associated with &quot;life-giving elixirs&quot;. The best known use of &quot;Vril&quot; in this context is in the name of Bovril (a blend word of Bovine and Vril). There was even a Vril-ya Bazaar held at the Royal Albert Hall in London in March 1891. The same year a sequel named &quot;The Vril Staff: A Romance&quot; was published, written by an unknown author using the pseudonym XYZ.

It also had a strong influence on other contemporary authors. When H. G. Wells&#x27; novella &quot;The Time Machine&quot; was published in 1895, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in its review: &quot;The influence of the author of &quot;The Coming Race&quot; is still powerful, and no year passes without the appearance of stories which describe the manners and customs of peoples in imaginary worlds, sometimes in the stars above, sometimes in the heart of unknown continents in Australia or at the Pole, and sometimes below the waters under the earth. The latest effort in this class of fiction is &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, by H. G. Wells.&quot;

Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about &quot;Vril&quot; against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to animal magnetism, or later, spiritualism. In his earlier novels &quot;Zanoni&quot; (1842) and &quot;A Strange Story&quot; (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other &quot;material agents&quot; as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In &quot;The Coming Race&quot;, those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives:

Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an &quot;initiate&quot; or &quot;adept&quot; by esotericists, especially because of his Rosicrucian novel &quot;Zanoni&quot; (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he was a member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been &quot;esotericized&quot; since the 1870s. In 1870, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia appointed Bulwer-Lytton as its &quot;Grand Patron&quot;. Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim was never revoked. Other claims, such as his supposed membership in the German Masonic lodge &quot;Zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe&quot;, have been proven wrong.

Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. Helena Blavatsky, the founder of theosophy, endorsed this view in her book &quot;Isis Unveiled&quot; (1877) and again in &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot; (1888). In Blavatsky&#x27;s writing, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky&#x27;s recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.

When the theosophist William Scott-Elliot described life in Atlantis in , he mentioned Atlantean aircraft propelled by Vril-force. His books are still published by the Theosophical Society. Scott-Elliot&#x27;s description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to UFOs after World War II.

George Bernard Shaw read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to Michael Holroyd&#x27;s biography of him.

French writer Jules Lermina included a Vril-powered flying machine in his 1910 novel &quot;L&#x27;Effrayante Aventure (Panic in Paris)&quot;.

In his 2011 book of correspondences with David Woodard, Swiss writer Christian Kracht discusses his longstanding interest in Vril. David Bowie&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; makes reference to the novel.

==Stage adaptation==

A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist David Christie Murray and magician Nevil Maskelyne. The production premiered at Saint George&#x27;s Hall in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father John Nevil Maskelyne collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.

==Vril Society==

===Willy Ley===

Willy Ley was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937. In 1947, he published an article titled &quot;Pseudoscience in Naziland&quot; in the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how Nazism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: 
&quot;The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself &#x27;Wahrheitsgesellschaft&#x27; – Society for Truth – and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril.&quot;

===Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels===
The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot;, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that was a sort of inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on Nazis which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.

In his book &quot;Monsieur Gurdjieff&quot;, Louis Pauwels claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General Karl Haushofer, a student of Russian magician and metaphysician Georges Gurdjieff.

===Publications on the Vril Society in German===

The book of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels was published in German with the title: &quot;Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft&quot; (literally &quot;Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason&quot;) in 1969.

In his book &quot;Black Sun&quot;, Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, &quot;Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Vril Energy&quot;), of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the &quot;Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft&quot;, which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication &quot;Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft&quot; (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym &quot;Johannes Täufer&quot; (German: &quot;John [the] Baptist&quot;). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was &quot;Täufer&quot;), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy. The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the &quot;Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft&quot; can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association. Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the &quot;Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft,&quot; who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875–1947).

===Esoteric neo-Nazism===

After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the Vienna Circle elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril theme in a new context. In their writings, Vril is associated with Nazi UFOs and the Black Sun concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the Tempelhofgesellschaft, has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as &quot;Iron Sky&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, and &quot;Call of Duty&quot;.

<text>Fettuccine is a type of pasta popular in Roman cuisine. It is descended from the extremely thin of the Renaissance, but is a flat, thick pasta traditionally made of egg and flour (usually one egg for every of flour). At about , it is wider and thicker than, but similar to, the tagliatelle typical of Bologna, which are more common elsewhere in Italy and is often used as a synonym. Spinach fettuccine is made from spinach, flour and eggs.

The terms &#x27; and &#x27; are often used as synonyms for this pasta, but the former term is more precisely used for wider (about ) and the latter for narrower (about ) forms of the same pasta.

Fettuccine is often classically eaten with (&#x27;beef ragù&#x27;) or (&#x27;chicken ragù&#x27;). A famous dish made with fettuccine is fettuccine Alfredo, a simple dish of pasta, Parmesan cheese and butter which was created and named at a restaurant in Rome in the early 20th century as a tableside &quot;performance&quot;. It is popular in the United States, where it is made with cream, although almost unknown in Italy.

Fettuccine is traditionally made fresh (either at home or commercially), but dried fettuccine can also be bought in stores.

<text>Dld was a library package for the C programming language that performs dynamic link editing. Programs that use dld can add or remove compiled object code from a process anytime during its execution. Loading modules, searching libraries, resolving external references, and allocating storage for global and static data structures are all performed at run time.

Dld supported various Unix platforms, having originally been developed for the VAX, Sun-3 and SPARCstation architectures.
Its authors contrast its functionality with the dynamic linking that was at the time of its construction available in operating systems such as SunOS 4, System V.4, HP-UX and VMS: all of these operating systems had shared libraries, but did not allow programs to load additional libraries after startup. Dld offered this functionality without requiring changes to the OS or toolchain.

Dld was a GNU package, but has been withdrawn because its functionality is available (through the codice_1 API) in modern Unix-like operating systems.

<text>The Ascot was an English automobile, the brainchild of Cyril Pullin (who also produced Ascot-Pullin motorcycles at the same time), that was manufactured between 1928 and 1930 in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. The factory had previously been used by Phoenix. The car was based largely on the Hungarian Fejes, with chassis and 10 hp engine assembled from welded steel pressings. The lack of castings was intended to keep the price low, at approximately 125 pounds, but due to lack of finance it never went into production.

A larger car, the Ascot Gold Cup Six with a 2423 cc six cylinder engine possibly made by Continental, 3-speed gearbox and servo brakes did become a reality and a few production cars were made. It was advertised as being available as a 2-seat sports, coupé or fabric saloon.

It had no connection with the 1904 Ascot or the 1914 Ascot car.

<text>Enrique Barόn Crespo (born 27 March 1944) is a Spanish politician, economist, and lawyer. He is a member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party and was a member of the European Parliament for the Party of European Socialists group until 2009.

Enrique Barón graduated in law from the University of Madrid and in business administration at ICADE, in Madrid, and ESSEC, in Paris, business schools, in 1965. As a practising lawyer, he specialised in labour law, and acted for defendants in political cases (1970–1977).

He was a Deputy in the Cortes (1977–1987) representing Madrid region and was Minister of Transport, Tourism and Communications (1982–1985). In that period he proposed the dismantlement of many miles of both major and secondary railway routes. The proposal was based on reports which understated the importance of these lines.

After election to the European Parliament he was President of the European Parliament (1989–1992), and was PES Group chairman from 1 November 1999 to 15 July 2004. He was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (1992–1995).

Barόn is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Global Panel Foundation and the Advisory Board of think tank Gold Mercury International, London, UK. He is an active player in Gold Mercury&#x27;s Brand EU initiative to improve the management and promotion of the European Union brand and monitor its progress.

In March 2008, Barón Crespo was received by the Italian President Giorgio Napolitano together with the CEO Pier Francesco Guarguaglini and the General Director Giorgio Zappa, at the end of the concerto for the 60th birth anniversary of the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica.

In 1985, Barón resigned as a minister and became a member of the European Parliament after Spain joined the European Union (EU), or what was then the European Community (EC), in 1986. As early as 1987, he ran for President of the European Parliament, but after three rounds of voting was defeated by only five votes to his British opponent, Charles Henry Plumb, Baron Plumb. On 25 July 1989 he was elected in the very first ballot as the youngest President of the European Parliament. He relinquished this office - as is customary in the European Parliament - after a two-and-a-half-year term.

<text>Ashley were manufacturers of body shells and chassis for specials from 1955 to 1962. They also offered a range of products for special builds: radiators, header tanks, lighting sets, steel tubing, sheet aluminium, various suspension parts, water pumps, tires, tubes and wheels. The company also made bonnets and hardtops for other mass-produced sports cars, including the Austin-Healey Sprite and Jaguar E-Type.

==History==

Ashley Laminates was founded in 1955 by Peter Pellandine and Keith Waddington. The name &quot;Ashley&quot; was chosen as it was the name of Peter Pellandine&#x27;s house in Woodford Green. They designed and built their first car using GRP for the bodyshell. The two set up a small factory in a garage next to the Robin Hood Inn at Loughton, Essex to produce shells. The garage has now made way for a pub car park. 

In late 1956 Pellandine left the company to found Falcon Shells, another specials company. Pellandine took with him the rights and tooling to manufacture the short-wheelbase bodyshell for the Ashley 750 and the Sports Racer which he continued in production as the Falcon Mark 1 and Mark 2 respectively.

In 1958, to increase manufacturing space, Ashley Laminates moved to the Potteries in Upshire, whilst retaining the Loughton premises as a showroom. He also introduced a new bodyshell, the 1172, and the Regent chassis. 1960 saw the introduction of the Sportiva. 

In 1961 the company moved again, this time to Bush Fair, Harlow, but the following year production of body shells ceased when the specials market waned, due to a change in Sales Tax rules. The company, however, continued to manufacture GRP hardtops and bonnets for sports cars. 

Adverts from 1963 onwards indicate that the company changed names to Ashley Auto Improvements and moved, this time to Bishops Stortford in Hertfordshire.
Although Keith Waddington died in the mid-1960s, the company continued until 1972.
The Ashley range of bodyparts has been re introduced in 2010 by Moto-Build Racing in Sutton in Surrey and whilst at present it focuses mainly on the MG Midget and Austin Healey Sprite there are moulds in progress for the Triumph Spitfire Mk1, 2 and 3, there is a website dedicated to this at www.ashleygt.co.uk

==Models==

===Ashley 750===
Based on the short-wheelbase (6-foot 3 inch) Austin Seven chassis, with its 747 cc engine (hence the model name). Later a long-wheelbase (6-foot 9 inch) version was offered. The price of both was the same: £78 for the shell and £25 for the hard top. The early hardtops had gull wing doors but it is believed that none have survived. When Pellandine left, he took the rights to build the short-wheelbase version, while Ashley just manufactured the long version.

===Ashley Sports Racer===
Introduced shortly after the 750 for £90, it was made to accommodate wheelbases from to As the name suggests the shell was primarily designed for track rather than everyday road use and could be mated to an Elva chassis. A number of contemporary racing cars used it.

===Ashley 1172===
Launched in August 1958, it was initially a roadster with a detachable hard top, to fit the Ford 8 and 10hp chassis of wheelbase with the Ford Sidevalve engine. It had a displacement of 1172 cc from which the model took its name. The Regent chassis was advertised as an alternative underpinning for the shell. Early in 1959 a fixed head coupe was offered whilst from January 1960 the 1172 was also available to fit the Prefect ladder frame. The roadster shells retailed for £105 and the coupes for £160. The rights to the 1172 body were acquired by Yitzhak Shubinsky of the Israeli Autocars Co. and modified, becoming both the Autocar Sabra and in a manufacturing agreement with Reliant, the Reliant Sabre.

===Ashley Sportiva===
Debuting in November 1960, it was initially an 1172 with revised front styling. It was made available as a bodyshell or with an Ashley chassis. It could be had as a drophead or a fixed head coupe with two or four seats. Later Sportiva&#x27;s had a revised rear with boot lid and a longer wheelbase of eight feet to accommodate the new Mark 6 chassis. The fixed head coupe bodyshell retailed for £182.

===Ashley Sportiva Morgan +4 Coupe===
Debuting at the 1962 Geneva Motor Show this Morgan +4 fitted with an Ashley Sportiva body-shell never went into production.

<text>Chinese Cubans () are Cubans of full or mixed Chinese ancestry who were born in or have immigrated to Cuba. They are part of the ethnic Chinese diaspora (or Overseas Chinese).

==History==

Chinese immigration to Cuba started in 1837 when Chinese (mainly Cantonese and Hakka) contract workers were forcibly brought to work in the sugar fields via the indentured labor system. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from Qing China, British Hong Kong, Portuguese Macau, and Taiwan during the following decades to replace and/or work alongside African and mixed-ancestry slaves. After completing eight-year contracts or otherwise obtaining their freedom, some Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Cuba, although most longed for repatriation to their homeland. Havana&#x27;s Chinatown (known as &quot;Barrio Chino de La Habana&quot;) is one of the oldest and largest Chinatowns in Latin America. Some 105,000 immigrants from the U.S. came to Cuba during the late 19th century to escape the discrimination present at the time. Another, albeit smaller wave of Chinese immigrants, also arrived during the 20th century, some as supporters of the communist cause during the Cuban revolution and others as dissidents escaping the authorities in China.

There were almost no women among the nearly entirely male Chinese &quot;coolie&quot; population that migrated to Cuba (1%). Marriages of Chinese immigrants with Cuban mulatto, black and white women were reported by the Cuba Commission Report.

In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black and mulatto populations.

In a study of genetic origins, admixture, and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba, thirty-five Y-chromosome SNPs were typed in the 132 male individuals of the Cuban sample. The study does not include any people with known Chinese ancestry. All the samples were white Cubans and black Cubans. Two out of 132 male samples belonged to East Asian haplogroup O2, which is found in significant frequencies among Cantonese people and is found in 1.5% of the Cuban population. In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Chinese arrived; the immigrants were exclusively male. In 1980, 4000 Chinese lived there, but by 2002, only 300 pure Chinese were left.

Two thousand Chinese, consisting of Cantonese and Hakkas, fought with the rebels in Cuba&#x27;s Ten Years&#x27; War. A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the war, on which is inscribed: &quot;There was not one Cuban Chinese deserter, not one Cuban Chinese traitor.&quot;

Chinese Cubans, including some Chinese Americans from California, joined the Spanish–American War in 1898 to achieve independence from Spain, but a few Chinese, who were loyal to Spain, left Cuba and went to Spain. Racial acceptance and assimilation would come much later.

When the new revolutionary government led by Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, the economic and political situation changed. Many Chinese business owners, having had their properties expropriated by the new government, left Cuba. Most of these settled in the United States, particularly nearby Florida, where they and their U.S.-born children are called Chinese Americans or Cuban Americans of Chinese descent, while a relatively few fled to the nearby Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries and also to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. As a result of this exodus, the number of pure Chinese dropped sharply in Havana&#x27;s &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;. The places to which they migrated had a unique Chinese culture and a popularity of Chinese Cuban restaurants.

==Current distribution==

From a peak population of 60,000 in the 1950s, the Chinese Cuban population has virtually disappeared following the Cuban Revolution in 1959. The majority of Chinese Cubans fled to the United States, in particular to Miami, Florida but some also settled in California or elsewhere in Latin America.

Of the Chinese who stayed after the start of Fidel Castro&#x27;s rule in 1961, the vast majority were of mixed descent with the local population. Today, younger generations are working in a wider variety of jobs than the previous generation including medicine, engineering, and law. A 2011 figure estimates that about 20,000 Cubans are of Chinese descent.

Once among the largest Chinatowns in Latin America, the &quot;Barrio Chino de La Habana&quot; is now the world&#x27;s smallest and is primarily concentrated in a small alleyway dominated by Chinese restaurants. Most Chinese Cubans live outside &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;.

Several community groups, especially Chinatown Promotional Group (Spanish: &quot;Grupo Promotor del Barrio Chino&quot;), worked to revive &quot;Barrio Chino&quot; and the faded Chinese culture. Chinese Language and Arts School (&quot;Escuela de la Lengua y Artes China&quot;) opened in 1993 and has grown since then, helping Chinese Cubans to strengthen their knowledge of the Chinese language. Today, Chinese Cubans tend to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and Hakka in addition to Spanish and English and may speak in a mixture of Chinese and Spanish. They also promoted small businesses, like beauty parlors, mechanical shops, restaurants and small groceries, provided to them to create a view of &quot;Barrio Chino&quot;. Havana&#x27;s &quot;Barrio Chino&quot; also experienced buildings of Chinese architecture and museum with backgrounds about China. As a result, the Chinese Cuban community has gained visibility.

==In literature and popular culture==
* The influence of the Chinese migration to Cuba is thoroughly reflected in the novel &quot;The Island of Eternal Love&quot; by Cuban American author Daína Chaviano. Originally published in Spain as &quot;La isla de los amores infinitos&quot;, it has been translated into 25 languages. The plot covers 150 years, from the 1840s through the 1990s.
* A Cuban Chinese family engaged in international intrigue appears in William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Spook Country&quot; (2007).
* In the 2006 film &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Gong Li portrays Isabella, a Chinese Cuban woman.

<text>The Ashton-Evans was an English car manufactured in Birmingham from 1919 to 1928 by Joseph Evans &amp; Co of Liverpool Street Mills an engineering company who also made railway locomotives and aircraft parts. In 1919 a new company Ashton-Evans Motors Ltd was formed. The cars were designed by E Bailey who had been with Sunbeam and later J. Bedford.

The first car of the marque designed by E Bailey was described as &quot;a three-wheeler with four wheels&quot; and had a rear track of only to avoid the need for a differential. The rear axle was suspended by a quarter elliptic spring fastened to the tubular chassis at the front and resting on a metal plate on the top of the rear axle which was located by the use of a torque tube and two rods. It is not certain if any of these cars were sold.

In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans decided to find out what his customers wanted in an &quot;owner driver&#x27;s ideal&quot; car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to double declutch. There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available.

Production of cars was slow and probably not profitable and in 1923 a single model, the 11/16 was made and the name returned to Ashton-Evans. A fire in 1924 badly hit production and car production was temporarily suspended in 1927 but never resumed.

As many as 250 might have been made.

<text>God&#x27;s Angry Man is a 1981 documentary film directed by Werner Herzog about Gene Scott, a U.S. pastor and Stanford PhD who served for almost fifty years as an ordained minister and religious broadcaster in Los Angeles. The film was produced for television. The German title &quot;Glaube und Währung&quot; translates as &quot;Faith and Currency&quot;.

The film consists of footage of Scott on the set of his television program &quot;Festival of Faith&quot; and interviews with Scott and Scott&#x27;s parents conducted by Herzog. The footage from Scott&#x27;s television program focuses almost exclusively on his fund-raising efforts and an elaborate rant against the Federal Communications Commission (F.C.C.). Scott at one point refuses to speak until his viewers pledge an additional $600. After several minutes of silence, he yells angrily at the camera until a production assistant informs him that they have received $700. Scott represents the F.C.C. on his show by a cymbal-banging monkey toy.

<text>The Detroit Zoo is a zoo located in the cities of Huntington Woods and Royal Oak in the U.S. state of Michigan. Spanning , it houses more than 2,000 animals and more than 200 different species. The zoo was the first U.S. zoo to feature bar-less habitats, and is regarded to be an international leader in animal welfare, conservation and sustainability by the Detroit Zoological Society.

==History==
The original Detroit Zoo opened in 1883, on Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, across from Tiger Stadium. William Cameron Coup&#x27;s circus had arrived in town, only to be forfeited and put up for auction due to financial difficulties. Luther Beecher, a local businessman, financed the purchase of the circus’s animals and erected a building for their display which he called the Detroit Zoological Garden. This iteration of the Zoo closed the following year, with the building converted into a horse auction site (the Michigan Avenue Horse Exchange).

The Detroit Zoological Society was founded several years later, in 1911, but the Zoo&#x27;s official opening did not occur until August 1, 1928. During the opening ceremony, acting Mayor John C. Nagel was to speak; he arrived late, and (unknowingly) parked his car behind the bear exhibits. Upon exiting his vehicle, a polar bear, kept in one of the original “barrier-less” enclosures, attempted to lunge at the mayor, nearly crossing the protective moat around its exhibit. Nagel stuck out his hand and walked toward the polar bear joking, &quot;He&#x27;s the reception committee.&quot; The keepers rushed to the bear and forced him back into the exhibit, leaving the mayor uninjured.
By 1930, the zoo included the Bear Dens, Sheep Rocks, the Bird House, an elk exhibit, Baboon Rock, and Primate and Reptile Houses. The Great Depression brought a halt to additional expansion, until the 1940s, and expansion has continued ever since. During the Depression, one of the more popular animals was ‘Jo Mendi’, a four-year-old chimpanzee purchased by the zoo director with his own funds. A veteran of Broadway musicals and motion pictures, the chimp performed for the crowds. One press account stated, &quot;he enjoys every minute of the act...He counts his fingers, dresses, laces his shoes, straps up his overalls; pours tea and drinks it; eats with a spoon, dances and waves farewell to his admirers.&quot; When the chimpanzee fell ill in late 1932, after eating a guest-thrown penny, surgeons from area hospitals came to assess his condition. During his recovery, visitors brought toys, peanuts and more than $500 worth of flowers, along with several thousand cards and letters. Jo died two years later, in 1934, from hoof and mouth disease.

In 1939, funded by a donation from Mary Rackham, the sculptor Corrado Parducci created the Horace Rackham Memorial Fountain, known as &quot;the Bear Fountain.&quot; During the summer, the fountain is a splash pad and in winter it becomes an ice rink.

From the 1950s through the early 1970s, local weatherman Sonny Eliot hosted a program called &quot;At The Zoo&quot;, shown on Saturdays on Detroit television station WDIV.
In 1950, the zoo hired senior floriculturist Thomas (Fred) Roberts. Roberts was a recognized expert on dahlias; his gardens at the zoo, particularly the dahlia exhibit to the west of the Rackham Memorial Fountain, attracted visitors from across the country. Throughout the mid-century era, and into the 1980s, the zoo&#x27;s gardens were elaborate displays of perennials, flowers, and tropical houseplants. Sonny Eliot interviewed Roberts for one of his episodes of &quot;At The Zoo&quot;. Fred Roberts remained at the zoo until 1978. His garden designs were maintained through the 1980s.

Until 1982, trained chimpanzees performed for visitors, but the act was discontinued at the insistence of animal rights activists. In 1982, the zoo began to charge an admission fee.

The Arctic Ring of Life, one of North America&#x27;s largest polar bear habitats, opened in 2001. Centered around a 300,000 gallon aquarium, it allows visitors to view polar bears from a 70-foot underwater tunnel made of clear acrylic. Other new buildings include the Ruth Roby Glancy Animal Health Complex (2004) and the Ford Education Center (2005), which offers school and youth group programs as well as having a theater and exhibit space.
In 2005 the Zoo became the first in the U.S. to no longer keep elephants for ethical reasons, claiming the Michigan winters were too harsh for the animals and that confining them was stressful. The elephants, Wanda and Winky, were relocated to the Performing Animal Welfare Society&#x27;s (PAWS) sanctuary in San Andreas, California. Winky died in April 2008; Wanda died in February 2015. The former elephant exhibit was renovated and is now home to two white rhinoceros, Jasiri and Tamba.

The Australian Outback Adventure, opened in 2006, allows visitors to walk through a simulated Outback containing red kangaroos and red-necked wallabies. Nothing separates visitors from the marsupials, allowing the animals to hop freely onto the walking path.

On February 18, 2006, the Detroit City Council voted to shut down the Zoo as part of budget cuts, being unable to reach an agreement with the Society to take over the park and a legislative grant having expired that day. An uproar ensued and the Council, on March 1, 2006, voted to transfer operations to the Society with a promised $4 million grant from the Michigan Legislature. The city retained ownership of the assets, including the Zoo in Royal Oak and the Belle Isle Nature Center in Detroit. The Society is responsible for governance, management and operations, including creating a plan to raise funds for long-term operations. On August 5, 2008, voters in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties overwhelmingly passed a zoo tax that provides sustainable funding to supplement earned revenue and philanthropic support.

The Penguinarium was temporarily renamed the &quot;Winguinarium&quot; in 2009 while the Detroit Red Wings played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals.
In 2011, the lions&#x27; enclosure was remodeled, providing animals more than double the room, new landscaping, and a glass wall to allow closer encounters with visitors. The Zoo also has the Simulator Ride, a 4-D Theater, the Tauber Family Railroad and a carousel.

In 2013, the Zoo celebrated its single largest donation ever ($10 million) by announcing plans for the Polk Penguin Conservation Center (PPCC), which opened in 2016. The Center replaces the Penguinarium (which itself was revolutionary when built in 1968) and became the world&#x27;s largest facility dedicated to the study of penguins. The Penguinarium will be converted into event space.

In 2017, a biodigester was installed to convert manure and food waste into methane, which is then used to power the zoo&#x27;s animal hospital.

On July 6, 2019, the Zoo celebrated the birth of Keti, a red panda cub, born after a 4-month gestation period.

In September 2019, the Penguin Center was closed for waterproofing repairs. The penguins were moved back to the original Penguinarium (their home from 1968 to 2015) until the Polk Center reopened. The center reopened on February 14, 2022 after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains 5 species of penguins; King, Macaroni, Gentoo, Chinstrap and Rockhopper.

==Habitats==

===National Amphibian Conservation Center===
The National Amphibian Conservation Center is a $7 million, 12,000-square-foot facility situated on a two-acre Michigan wetland area and pond called &quot;Amphibiville&quot;. The Center, which opened in June 2000, has a diverse range of frogs, toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; dubbed the attraction &quot;Disneyland for toads&quot;. The Center participates in research and conservation efforts for species including the Panamanian golden frog, Puerto Rican crested toad, and Wyoming toad.

In 2002, the Zoo was awarded the AZA National Exhibit Award for Amphibiville.

===The Arctic Ring of Life===

The 4-acre Arctic Ring of Life, opened in October 2001, is home to three polar bears and two southern sea otters. It is among the largest polar bear habitats in North American zoos. In 2003, the Zoo was awarded the AZA Significant Achievement Award for the Arctic Ring of Life.

===Cotton Family Wetlands and Boardwalk===
Mimicking a Michigan ecosystem, the 1.7-acre pond and wetlands area and accompanying 7,200-square-foot boardwalk is home to native fish, frogs, turtles and birds as well as trumpeter swans. The boardwalk is made from 95-percent recycled material composed primarily of plastic grocery bags and reclaimed hardwood. The Wetlands and Boardwalk are bounded by Amphibiville, the Warchol Beaver Habitat, the Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat, and the Holden Reptile Conservation Center.

Due to a $102,350 grant from NOAA, the Wetlands are also used as professional development and outdoor classroom for teachers and students underrepresented in science fields.

===Cotton Family Wolf Wilderness===
The Cotton Family Wolf Wilderness is a $1.4 million two-acre sanctuary that features native meadows and trees, a flowing stream and pond, dens, and elevated rock outcroppings, for two gray wolves. The habitat also incorporates a renovated historic log cabin which had existed on the property.

===Giraffe Encounter===

The guests feed reticulated giraffes from an 18-foot-tall platform that extends into their habitat in the Giraffe Encounter. This experience, which started in July 2007, runs Tuesday through Sunday from spring through fall. This is an added fee.

===The Great Apes of Harambee===
The Great Apes of Harambee is a 4-acre indoor/outdoor habitat home to chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas. The animals may be rotated into each other&#x27;s habitat spaces, simulating nomadic movement similar to wild behavior.

===Holden Reptile Conservation Center===
Opened as the Holden Museum of Living Reptiles in 1960, the Holden Reptile Conservation Center is home to 150 reptiles representing 70 species, 45 percent of which are considered threatened or endangered in the wild.

===Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat===
The Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat provides a habitat for North American river otters and features a 9,000-gallon pool with a waterfall and waterslide. The pool is enclosed on one side by a glass wall, on the other side of which is an observation building. The habitat affords visitors – including small children – an eye-level view of the otters as they swim.

===Polk Penguin Conservation Center===

The Polk Penguin Conservation Center (PPCC), opened in April 2016, is the largest center for penguins in the world and was awarded the 2017 Exhibit Award by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for excellence in exhibit design. The PPCC was closed for waterproofing repairs from September 2019 to February 14, 2022.

===Jane and Frank Warchol Beaver Habitat===
Opened in 2013, the Jane and Frank Warchol Beaver Habitat abuts the Cotton Family Wetlands, and is home to nine North American beavers. As beavers are nocturnal, their night-time activities are recorded and played throughout the day on televisions in the exhibit. This is the first time beavers have been on display at the Zoo since 1969.

===The Wildlife Interpretive Gallery===
The Wildlife Interpretive Gallery is home to the Butterfly Garden, Matilda Wilson Free-Flight Aviary, Science On a Sphere, as well as the Society&#x27;s permanent fine art collection. The Shelle Isle exhibit is dedicated to the partula snail.

==Detroit Zoological Society==
The Detroit Zoological Society is a non-profit organization that operates the Zoo and the Belle Isle Nature Center. The $44.5 million annual operating budget of the organization is supported by earned revenue, philanthropic support, and tri-county (Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne) millage. The organization has 260 full and part-time employees, more than 52,000 member households, and more than 1,000 volunteers.

The mission of the organization is &quot;Celebrating and Saving Wildlife&quot;, the Society claims to be a leader in animal conservation and welfare. In collaboration with the DNR and USFWS, the Society continues to release Zoo-reared federally endangered Karner blue butterflies in their natural habitats in Michigan. Each summer, Society bird keepers assist with conservation efforts in northern Michigan for the federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover by artificially incubating abandoned piping plover eggs. Most recently, the Society, in collaboration with the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, established of a common tern nesting site on Belle Isle.

The Society assists with the rescue of exotic animals from private owners, pseudo-sanctuaries, roadside zoos, and circuses. Among its rescues are more than 1,000 exotic animals confiscated from an animal wholesaler in Texas, a polar bear confiscated from a circus in Puerto Rico, a lioness used to guard a crack house, and retired racehorses. In addition, the Society and the Michigan Humane Society, in collaboration with dozens of local animal welfare organizations, host Meet Your Best Friend at the Zoo, the nation&#x27;s largest offsite companion animal adoption program. Since the event&#x27;s inception in 1993, more than 25,000 dogs, cats, and rabbits have been placed into new homes at the spring and fall events.
The Center for Zoo and Aquarium Animal Welfare and Ethics (CZAAWE) was created in 2009 as a resource center for captive exotic animal welfare knowledge and best practices. The center provides a much-needed forum for exotic animal welfare policy discussion/debate and recognizes captive exotic animal welfare initiatives through awards.

The Society provides educational experiences to nearly 70,000 teachers and students annually through camps, curriculum-based field trips, family and youth programs and professional development opportunities. The Society also supports students and teachers through conservation education in rural rainforest communities through the Adopt-A-School program. The Berman Academy for Humane Education offers a broad range of programs that help people help animals. The academy uses a variety of teaching strategies – from traditional instruction to storytelling, role-playing, theater, and virtual technology – to educate audiences about the need to treat other living creatures with empathy, respect and gentleness.

Accredited by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums, the Zoo features many award-winning habitats including the Wildlife Interpretive Gallery, National Amphibian Conservation Center, Great Apes of Harambee and Arctic Ring of Life, which was named the number-two best zoo exhibit in the U.S. by the Intrepid Traveler&#x27;s guide to &quot;America&#x27;s Best Zoos&quot;.

The Simulator Ride offers an educational experience from a motion-simulated theater seat. The 126-seat 4-D Theater, the only of its kind at any Michigan zoo, features special effects such as blasts of wind, mist and scents.

===Belle Isle Nature Center===
The Belle Isle Nature Center sits on a five-acre site surrounded by undisturbed forested wetlands on Belle Isle State Park in Detroit. The facility features indoor animal habitats, a bee exhibit, bird observation window, an outdoor native butterfly garden, outdoor classrooms, nature play area and the Blue Heron Lagoon Nature Trail. It provides year-round educational, recreational and environmental conservation opportunities for the community.

<text>Scouting in Rhode Island has a long history, from the 1910s to the present day, serving thousands of youth in programs that suit the environment in which they live.

==Early history (1910–1950)==

===Rhode Island Boy Scouts===

The Rhode Island Boy Scouts (RIBS), formerly American Boy Scouts of Rhode Island , was a Scouting organization in the United States from 1910 until its merger with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1917. RIBS still exists as a trustee organization.

===Boy Scouts of America===
In 1910 the First Providence Troop was organized in Washington Park. On October 24, 1910, the troop was formally recognized by Scout headquarters. Troop meetings were held at the Broad Street School. The first Scoutmaster was Herbert R. Dean, a retired Army general. The first charter listed sixty-four boys.

Four BSA councils were formed in the state. The first council, Providence Council (#546), was organized in 1916 based in Providence. The second was Pawtucket Council (#548) in 1917 and ended in 1920. From 1918 to 1924, Newport Council (#547) existed. In 1924, Woonsocket Council (#549) formed a council.

In 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts merged with Providence Council to form the Greater Providence Area Council (#546) and recognized its existence back to 1910. In 1922, Pawtucket Council was reorganized into Pawtucket &amp; Central Falls Council (#548). In 1924, Newport Council became Newport County Council (#547). In 1926, the Greater Providence Area Council was created from the merger of Greater Providence Council and Newport County Council. In the years 1929 and 1930, the three Rhode Island councils merged into Narragansett Council.
The present Narragansett Council was formed as the result of a 2001 merger between the Moby Dick Council and the Narragansett Council.

===Narragansett Council===
Narragansett Council is based in East Providence, Rhode Island, but has 3 service areas that serve communities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut:
*Southeast Service Area- New Bedford, Fairhaven, Dartmouth, Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, Acushnet, Wareham, Fall River, Assonet, Freetown, Somerset, Westport, Swansea, Seekonk, Rehoboth, Portsmouth, Middletown, Newport, Tiverton, Little Compton, East Providence, Bristol, Warren, Barrington
*Southwest Service Area- Coventry, West Warwick, East Greenwich, West Greenwich, Exeter, Frenchtown, Warwick, Block Island, Narragansett, Wakefield, Westerly, Misquamicut, Bradford, Ashaway, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Charlestown, Richmond, Hopkinton, Hope Valley, Peacedale, South Kingstown, Kingston, West Kingston, Davisville, North Kingstown, Quidnessett, Wickford, Jamestown
*Northwest Service Area- Burrillville, Scituate, Foster, Glocester, Johnston, Smithfield, North Providence, Providence, Cranston, Woonsocket, Blackstone, Bellingham, North Smithfield, Millville, Uxbridge, Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls, Pawtucket
*Northeast Service Area- North Attleboro, Attleboro, South Attleboro, Chartley, Norton, Mansfield, Dighton, Berkley, Taunton, East Taunton, Raynham, Middleboro, Carver, Lakeville

====Massasoit Council====

The Fall River Council rechartered as the Massasoit Council. It was headquartered in Fall River, Massachusetts and served that city and the surrounding communities of Somerset, Swansea, Westport, Tiverton and Little Compton. The Wampanoag District served Somerset and Swansea. The Council Office was located in the Women&#x27;s Union Building on Rock Street. The Massasoit Council existed until 1972.

The primary source for Boy Scout uniforms and gear was McWhirr&#x27;s department store on South Main Street in Fall River. Many Council-wide Scouting events were often held at Lincoln Park in Westport, Massachusetts. The Firestone Rubber Company, which had a large factory in Fall River, sponsored the Firestone Award for outstanding Boy Scouts in the Massasoit Council in the 1950s and 1960s. These recognition events were held at White&#x27;s in Westport.

 Camping for the Fall River Council began in 1917 at Camp Stanford in Fall River and provided an outlet for boys for four years. It was decided in 1921 at a Fall River Council Executive Board meeting that the purchase of a wooded area would take place, naming it Camp Noquochoke. Additional land was purchased in Camp Noquochoke&#x27;s later years covering over on the eastern shore of the Westport River in Westport. Camp site facilities ranged from undeveloped, to tent sites with platforms, to A-frames (&quot;Adirondacks&quot;) to cabins with stoves and bunk beds.

The physical facilities were significantly improved in the late 1950s with a new dining hall (constructed by Fall River (Building) Trades Council with site work provided by the Navy SeabeesReservists) and an in-ground pool. The Navy Seabee Reservists did upgrade the camp road from the entrance on Pine Hill Road to its termination by the former or old dining hall ending at the river&#x27;s bluff. The Seabees also did the site work for the new dining hall, dugout the archery range and may have partially or completely built the rifle range on the newly acquired Donovan property. This work done by the Seabees was part of their community service, especially non-profit agencies.

Camp legend, the basis for many campfire stories, was a character named &quot;Three-fingered Willie.&quot; Camp Noquochoke continued to serve area youth until 1980.

====Cachalot Council====
On May 13, 1935, as part of complying with new rules of incorporation for Boy Scout councils in Massachusetts, the New Bedford Council changed its name to the Cachalot Council. The name, derived from the French and Portuguese words for sperm whale, was proposed by Joe Allen, of the [Martha&#x27;s] Vineyard Gazette, in January 1933 to honor the history of whaling in New Bedford.

At the time, the Council did own a property that was used as a camp. This property, off Rock O&#x27; Dundee Road in South Dartmouth [2], was too small and lacked adequate water sources, both for drinking and swimming. For a short time, from 1937 through 1942, the council shared the summer camp facilities of the Fall River Council [3], but this was deemed &quot;not satisfactory for many reasons.&quot; [4] From 1943 through 1945, summer camp was held at Camp Maxim, which was owned by the local Boys Club, and also failed to meet the needs of the program.

In 1945, the Cachalot Council conducted a capital fundraising campaign expressly for the purpose of acquiring a suitable camp. Many local businesses and individuals contributed, and the campaign successfully raised $75,000. At the same time, the council began looking for a suitable property. After considering several properties [5], they placed on offer on a large parcel adjacent to the southeastern corner of Myles Standish State Forest, owned by &quot;The Five Mile Corporation.&quot; This corporation, headed by Theodore Steinway (of Steinway &amp; Sons Piano), Albert Hathaway, and Russell Davis, had purchased the property during the Great Depression for a mere $12,000, and agreed to sell it to the council for the same price. The deed was signed over in January 1946, and preparations immediately commenced to open the Camp for its first summer camp season ever, with Roland Deneault as Camp Director, in summer of the same year. It has operated continuously since. Cachalot Scout Reservation remains to this day serving scouts in Southeast Massachusetts.
Cachalot Council&#x27;s Order of the Arrow lodge was Agawam Lodge 509 which had the totem of the whale.

====Moby Dick Council====
The Moby Dick Council (also known as Moby Dick Council of Massachusetts and Rhode Island) was formed in 1972 by a merger of the Cachalot Council of Greater New Bedford and the Massasoit Council of Greater Fall River. The two former councils were small, and fell victim to the BSA&#x27;s desire to create larger councils. In 2001, Moby Dick Council suffered a similar fate, and merged with the Narragansett Council of Rhode Island, much to the chagrin of many old-timers of both the smaller councils and the larger Moby Dick Council.
Camps
Moby Dick Council originally had two camps: Camp Cachalot was the camp for Cachalot Council, and Camp Noquochoke was the camp for Massasoit Council. Camp Noquochoke was sold due to its smaller size and fewer prospects, and later became a residential neighborhood. Camp Cachalot still remains as a weekend and summer resident camp owned and operated by the Narragansett Council.

Massasoit Council&#x27;s Noquochoke Lodge 124 of the Order of the Arrow merged with Cachalot Council&#x27;s Agawam Lodge 509 to form Neemat Lodge 124.

====Annawon Council 1930-2015====

The Annawon Council is a local council of the Boy Scouts of America headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts. It is one of the few small councils that remained in the area.

In 1930 Annawon Council was organized, but it was not until January 9, 1931, that it was incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts, and legally established as of April 20, 1933. At the time of organization, the Council included the communities of Attleboro, Mansfield, Norton, Taunton, Raynham, and Berkley. William Lee Abbott was appointed Scout Executive and secretary. Dr. Joseph L. Murphy of Taunton was the first Council president, Annawon was one of the last Councils in Massachusetts to be organized. In 1916 the first Scouting charters in Massachusetts were granted to the Fall River and the Fairhaven-New Bedford Councils. Annawon Council was incorporated in 1931. The state of Massachusetts required that both Fall River and Fairhaven-New Bedford council recharter under the articles of incorporation, at that time Fall River Council became known as the Massasoit Council and Fairhaven-New Bedford Council became known as the Cachalot Council.

During 1932 first serious consideration was given a Council-owned camp site for Annawon Scouts. Although considerable thought was given to a site on Lake Mashpee on Cape Cod, the Council reneged on a thirty-day option to buy the property. During the summer of 1932 the invitation of Old Colony Council to camp with them at Camp Childs on Morey&#x27;s Pond was accepted. on October 1, 1932, as a result of the permission of Mr. Clement Jeffers of Attleboro, a camp site for weekend camping was dedicated as Camp Jeffers. During the summer of 1933, the scouts camped on Greenwood Lake, West Mansfield, at Camp Annawon. This was the first year that a camp existed, the site was known as Camp Finberg, it was a YMCA camp. After considerable study in 1934, the Council purchased 25 Acres on Darby Pond in Plymouth for use as a camp site. The site was known as &quot;Camp King&quot; and was purchased from Phillip Cole for $2,500.00. From July 15 to August 19, scouts camped on the shore of Darby Pond at Camp Annawon. The original entrance road was off of Plymouth street just off of Carver St (Route 44). It crossed over the cranberry dam below the present BB Range. On June 24, 1935, William A. Collins of Norwich, Connecticut and a graduate of MIT was appointed Scout Executive. He immediately went into camp to direct the Council Camp, which was officially named Camp Norse for the first time. That year the boy week count rose to 165.

In 1940 the land north of the original property of 25 acres was purchased for $300.00, it included an abandoned house in a large field. This field became the ball field. A new entrance road into camp was built off of Partings way road. It was later enlarged by the National Guard Army Corps of Engineers. In 1950 Ellis Brewster from the Plymouth Cordage Company donated 100 acres to Annawon council to increase the size of Camp Norse. That same year, the shallow well was replaced with a deeper well and then was enclosed in a block house through a grant from the George Magee Memorial Fund. In 1960 the camp received a bronze bell, dated 1891. Howard Fowler, Editor of The Mansfield News and former Council President, was instrumental in procuring the bell from the Mansfield Fire Department. It came from an old firehouse on West Church St In Mansfield.

Camp Norse is the sole camp of the council located at 112 Parting Ways Rd. Kingston, Massachusetts. In 2014, it was announced that Annawon Council will be merging with a neighboring council. In the spring of 2015, Annawon Council&#x27;s executive committee announced it will be starting merger talks with Narragansett Council headquartered in East Providence, Rhode Island. The council formally merged in September 2015. The council was divided into the following districts serving 11 communities in Bristol and Plymouth Counties:
*Angle Tree District: North Attleboro, Attleboro, Norton, Mansfield
*Sachem District: Dighton, Berkley, Taunton, Raynham, Middleboro, Carver, Lakeville

In June 1941, Tulpe Lodge, Order of the Arrow was approved by the executive board. On August 2, 1943, the council applied for and received a charter for their new Order of the Arrow Lodge, and Tulpe Lodge was official. The turtle shell symbol came from the turtles from Camp Norse. Apparently it was custom at the time to hollow out a turtle shell and use it as a neckerchief slide. There is no chapter system in use for the two districts of the lodge/council. Tulpe has hosted three conclaves at Camp Norse for Area 1C, and Section NE-1B. The name Tulpe remained in the Narragansett Council Merger.

====South East Camping Association==== 
In 1993 Camp Norse officially became Camp Norse Cub World and was no longer used for the summer camp for the Scout Troops but rather was used by Cub Scouts through the South East Camping Association (SEMCA). This was a North East Region BSA sanctioned program that included the Cape Cod and Islands Council, Annawon Council, and the Moby Dick Council. This effort was designed to use the resources available in these three councils. Troop camping for all three Councils was to be at Camp Cachalot which was owned by the Moby Dick Council. The Cub Scout summer camp would be at Camp Norse, and the Boy Scout High Adventure summer camp, would be at Camp Greenough on Cape Cod.

====The Original Narragansett Council 1917-2001====

The Narragansett Council, Boy Scouts of America is part of a worldwide Scouting movement with over 15 million members in one hundred countries. Boy Scouting began in England in 1907 when the British military hero, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, organized the first Boy Scout camp. In 1908, he published Scouting for Boys and formed what would become the British Boy Scout Association.

As a result of a “good turn” performed by an English Scout in London for Chicago publisher William D. Boyce, Scouting came to America. The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated in 1910 and chartered by Congress on June 15, 1916.

Scouting in Rhode Island began as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts which was first organized as a voluntary association on September 6, 1910. On April 13, 1911, it was chartered under state laws for the purpose of giving boys of Rhode Island an organization in which they could be formed into groups that mirrored the newly formed national Boy Scout Program. From 1910 to 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts established groups (troops) throughout Rhode Island, except in Newport, Blackstone Valley and Woonsocket. In these locations, troops were organized and affiliated with the National Council Boy Scouts of America.

In 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts ‘merged’ with the National movement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America was formed to take over the operation of the Scouting Program and supervision of troops. The National Council Boy Scouts of America recognized the date of the council&#x27;s organization as September 6, 1910, and granted all members back service to that date. The National Council Boy Scouts of America also agreed that the Rhode Island Boy Scouts could maintain its corporate identity so that it could continue to receive bequests, hold funds and properties and acquire other funds and properties in the future; thus, the formation of Rhode Island Boy Scouts as a Trustee organization.

In 1929 and 1930, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America merged with the Newport County Council, the Pawtucket-Central Falls Council and the Woonsocket Council to form the Narragansett Council.

The Order of the Arrow Lodge was the Wincheck Lodge 534 which had the totem of the bear and specifically served Yawgoog Scout Reservation. It was formed in the 1950s from Yawgoog&#x27;s honor society, The Wincheck Indians, when the Order of the Arrow became growing in national popularity.

==== Narragansett Council 2002-2015====
On July 1, 2001, the Moby Dick Council headquartered in New Bedford, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in Providence, Rhode Island, adding 17 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the six cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The Council serves almost 26,000 registered youth members and Learning for Life participants and supports in excess of 5,000 registered adult volunteers. The Narragansett Council operates two Scout Shops/Service Centers (one in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, Rhode Island and one in the Swansea Mall in Swansea, Massachusetts) and owned and operated eight great camps: Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, Rhode Island, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, Rhode Island, Cachalot Scout Reservation in Carver, MassachusettsA, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, Rhode Island, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. Administrative functions are housed at 10 Risho Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island.

The Order of the Arrow Lodge is Abnaki Lodge 102 with the totem of a bear and a peace pipe.

Narragansett Council began merger talks with Annawon Council based in Norton, Massachusetts in 2015 and officially merged on September 10, 2015, under the name Narragansett Council.

====The Modern Narragansett Council====
On September 10, 2015, the Annawon Council headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in East Providence, Rhode Island, adding 11 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the 23 cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The newly merged operation, which will take the name of the Narragansett Council, includes all of Rhode Island, 34 communities in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut, and boasts nearly 14,000 Scouts, the largest in Northeast Area 1. The Narragansett Council’s main headquarters remain at its current location in East Providence. The Narragansett Council operates a Scout Shop in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, Rhode Island. The Council owns and operates nine camps: Camp Norse in Kingston, Massachusetts, Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, Rhode Island, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, Rhode Island, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Cachalot Scout Reservation in Carver, Massachusetts, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, Rhode Island, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. Administrative functions are housed at 10 Risho Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island.

The Order of the Arrow lodge of the council is Tulpe Lodge 102 with the totem of the turtle, formed from a merger of Narragansett Council&#x27;s Abnaki Lodge 102 and Annawon Council&#x27;s Tulpe Lodge 245.

==Scouting in Rhode Island today==

<text>Malachi Brendan Martin (23 July 1921 – 27 July 1999), also known under the pseudonym of Michael Serafian, was an Irish-born American Traditionalist Catholic priest, biblical archaeologist, exorcist, palaeographer, professor, and writer on the Catholic Church.

Ordained as a Jesuit, Martin became Professor of Palaeography at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. From 1958, he served as secretary to Cardinal Augustin Bea during preparations for the Second Vatican Council. Disillusioned by the council, Martin asked to be released from certain aspects of his Jesuit vows in 1964 and moved to New York City.

Martin&#x27;s 17 novels and non-fiction books were frequently critical of the Catholic hierarchy, who he believed had failed to act on what he called &quot;the Third Prophecy&quot; revealed by the Virgin Mary at Fátima. His works included &quot;The Scribal Character of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot; (1958) and &quot;Hostage to the Devil&quot; (1976), which dealt with Satanism, demonic possession, and exorcism. &quot;The Final Conclave&quot; (1978) was a warning against Soviet espionage in the Vatican.

==Biography==

===Early life, education and ordination===
Martin was born in Ballylongford, County Kerry, Ireland, to a middle-class family in which the children were raised speaking Irish at the dinner table. His parents, Conor and Katherine Fitzmaurice Martin, had five sons and five daughters. Four of the five sons became priests, including his younger brother, Francis Xavier Martin.

Martin attended Belvedere College in Dublin, then studied philosophy for three years at University College Dublin. On 6 September 1939, he became a novice with the Society of Jesus. Martin taught for three years, spending four years at Milltown Park, Dublin, and was ordained in August 1954.

Upon completion of his degree course in Dublin, Martin was sent to the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, where he took a doctorate in archaeology, Oriental history, and Semitic languages. He started postgraduate studies at both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the University of Oxford. Martin specialized in intertestamentary studies, Jesus in Jewish and Islamic sources, Ancient Hebrew and Arabic manuscripts. He undertook additional study in rational psychology, experimental psychology, physics, and anthropology.

===Work===
Martin participated in the research on the Dead Sea Scrolls and published 24 articles on Semitic palaeography. He did archaeological research and worked extensively on the Byblos syllabary in Byblos, in Tyre, and in the Sinai Peninsula. Martin assisted in his first exorcism while working in Egypt for archaeological research. In 1958, he published a work in two volumes, &quot;The Scribal Character of the Dead Sea Scrolls&quot;.

Martin&#x27;s years in Rome coincided with the beginning of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), which was to transform the Catholic Church in a way that the initially liberal Martin began to find distressing. He became friends with Monsignor George Gilmary Higgins and Father John Courtney Murray.

In Rome, Martin became a professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, where he taught Aramaic, Hebrew, palaeography, and Sacred Scripture. He also taught theology, part-time, at Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s John Felice Rome Center. Martin worked as a translator for the Eastern Orthodox Churches and Ancient Oriental Churches Division of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity under Bea. Martin became acquainted with Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, in 1961 and 1962. Martin accompanied Pope Paul VI on a trip to Jordan in January 1964. He resigned his position at the Pontifical Institute in June 1964.

In 1964, Martin requested a release from his vows and from the Jesuit Order. He received a provisional release in May 1965 and a dispensation from his vows of poverty and obedience on 30 June 1965 (cf. qualified exclaustration). Even if dispensed from his religious vow of chastity, Martin remained under the obligation of chastity if still an ordained secular priest. Martin maintained that he remained a priest, saying that he had received a dispensation from Paul VI to that effect.

Martin moved to New York City in 1966, working as a dishwasher, a waiter, and taxi driver, while continuing to write. He co-founded an antiques firm and was active in communications and media for the rest of his life.

===Communications and media===
In 1967, Martin received his first Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1970, he published the book &quot;The Encounter: Religion in Crisis&quot;, winning the of the American Library Association. He then published &quot;Three Popes and the Cardinal: The Church of Pius, John and Paul in its Encounter with Human History&quot; (1972) and &quot;Jesus Now&quot; (1973). In 1970, Martin became a naturalized U.S. citizen.

In 1969, Martin received a second Guggenheim Fellowship, allowing him to write his first of four bestsellers, &quot;Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Living Americans&quot; (1976). In the book, Martin calls himself an exorcist, claiming he assisted in several exorcisms. According to McManus Darraugh, William Peter Blatty &quot;wrote a tirade against Malachi, saying his 1976 book was a fantasy, and he was just trying to cash in.&quot; Darraugh also said that Martin became &quot;an iconic person in the paranormal world.&quot;

Martin served as religious editor for the &quot;National Review&quot; from 1972 to 1978. He was interviewed twice by William F. Buckley, Jr. for &quot;Firing Line&quot; on PBS. He was an editor for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

Martin published several works of fiction and non-fiction in the following years:

* &quot;Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Living Americans&quot; (1976)
* &quot;The Final Conclave&quot; (1978)
* &quot;King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Vatican: A Novel&quot; (1986)

His other works included:

* &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (1964)
* &quot;The Encounter&quot; (1970)
* &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church&quot; (1981)
* &quot;The New Castle: Reaching for the Ultimate&quot; (1982)
* &quot;Rich Church, Poor Church: The Catholic Church and its Money&quot; (1984) 
* &quot;There is Still Love: Five Parables of God&#x27;s Love That Will Change Your Life&quot; (1984)

Martin&#x27;s bestselling 1987 non-fiction book, &quot;The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church&quot;, was highly critical of the Jesuit Order, accusing the Jesuits of systematically undermining church teachings.

===Later life===
Martin was a periodic guest on Art Bell&#x27;s radio program, &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;, between 1996 and 1998. The show continues to play tapes of his interviews on Halloween.

Martin&#x27;s &quot;The Keys of This Blood: The Struggle for World Dominion between Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West&quot; was published in 1990. It was followed in 1996 by &quot;Windswept House: A Vatican Novel&quot;.

The Vatican restored Martin&#x27;s faculty to celebrate Mass in 1989, at his request. He was strongly supported by some Traditionalist Catholic sources and severely criticized by other sources, such as the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;. Martin served as a guest commentator for CNN during the live coverage of the visit of Pope John Paul II to the United States in October 1995.

===Death===

In 1999, Malachi Martin died in Manhattan of an intracerebral haemorrhage, four days after his 78th birthday. It was caused by a fall in his apartment in Manhattan. The documentary &quot;Hostage to the Devil&quot; claimed that Martin said he was pushed from a stool by a demonic force.

Martin&#x27;s funeral took place in St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in West Orange, New Jersey, before burial at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, in Hawthorne, New York.

== Work ==

===Writings===
In 1964, under the pseudonym of &quot;Michael Serafian&quot;, Martin wrote &quot;The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, the Council, &amp; the Church in a Time of Decision&quot;. The book contained Martin&#x27;s views on the Jewish question in Europe and on the Second Vatican Council. Martin&#x27;s fictional works purported to give detailed insider accounts of Church history during the reigns of Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI (&quot;The Pilgrim, Three Popes and the Cardinal, Vatican: A Novel&quot;), John Paul I (&quot;The Final Conclave&quot;) and John Paul II (&quot;The Keys of This Blood&quot;, &quot;Windswept House&quot;).

===Opinions===

==== Three secrets of Fátima ====
Martin often spoke and wrote about the Three Secrets of Fátima and was an ardent supporter of Father Nicholas Gruner&#x27;s interpretations of them: &quot;Father Gruner is fulfilling a desperately needed function in the ongoing perception of Mary&#x27;s role in the salvation of our imperilled world. Father Gruner is absolutely correct that the consecration of Russia as Our Lady desired, has not been executed&quot;. According to Martin, the unreleased third secret of Fatima was that the Soviet Union would be converted to Christianity. The Vatican released what it claimed to be the third secret letter in 2000. This text did not mention Russia or the Soviet Union.

==== Other theories ====
Martin did not believe in the alleged apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Međugorje in what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said that false pretenses were used in obtaining earlier his recommendation. Concerning the Garabandal apparitions, he remained open minded.

In March 1997, Martin claimed on Radio Liberty&#x27;s &quot;Steel on Steel&quot;, that two popes were murdered during the 20th century:
* Pope Pius XI was allegedly murdered by Benito Mussolini, because of his 1931 encyclical, &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot;, which was critical of the Italian Fascist state.
* Pope John Paul I was allegedly murdered according to Martin&#x27;s book, &quot;Vatican: A Novel&quot;, by Jean-Marie Villot, formerly Cardinal Secretary of State under Pope Paul VI, under orders from the Soviet Union.
Martin stated that, along with diabolic possession, angelic possession also exists and that angels could have use of preternatural powers in certain circumstances.

==== Siri theory ====
Martin partially gave credence to the Siri thesis, saying that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri was twice elected pope in papal conclaves, but declined his election after being pressured by so-called worldly forces acting through cardinals present at the conclaves. Martin called this &quot;the little brutality&quot;. On the one hand, Martin says that Siri was intimidated; on the other hand he says that Siri did indicate that his decision not to accept was made freely.
* The second election was the Papal conclave, October 1978. Martin said on &quot;Steel on Steel&quot; in March 1997, that Siri received a written note after his initial election threatening him and his family with death should he accept.

=== Freemasons ===
Martin claimed that John XXIII and Paul VI were Freemasons during a certain period and that photographs and other detailed documents proving this were in the possession of the Vatican State Secretariat. He allegorically mentioned these supposed facts in his 1986 novel &quot;Vatican: A Novel&quot;, where he related the Masonic adherence of Pope Giovanni Angelica and Giovanni De Brescia. Martin also claimed that Archbishop Annibale Bugnini was a Freemason and that Agostino Casaroli, long-time Cardinal Secretary of State, was an atheist.

=== Metz accord ===
In his 1987 book &quot;The Jesuits&quot;, Martin describes negotiations and a diplomatic agreement between the Vatican and the USSR named the &quot;Moscow Vatican Pact of 1962&quot; or the &quot;Metz Pact&quot;. In this &quot;little-known&quot; agreement, the Vatican allegedly promised non-condemnation of Soviet Communism or Marxism in exchange for the participation of Russian-Orthodox prelates as observers at the Second Vatican Council. Description of this incident was embedded as background within a larger discussion of a meeting at the Vatican in the middle of spring 1981 between Pope John Paul II and his six most powerful cardinals. In his book &quot;The Final Conclave&quot;, published on 1 August 1978, the month of the 1978 conclave that resulted in the 26 August election of Albino Luciani, Martin wrote of the unexpected election of a &quot;Cardinal Angelico&quot;, a figure that has been interpreted as corresponding to Luciani.

==Controversies==

===Alleged affairs===
There were two allegations made against Martin of having affairs with women:
* Martin was criticized in the book &quot;Clerical Error: A True Story&quot; by Robert Blair Kaiser, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s former Vatican correspondent. Kaiser, a former Jesuit, accused Martin of having carried on an extramarital affair with his wife during 1964 in Rome, and claimed that Martin fled to the United States as a renegade from the priesthood. A friend of Martin&#x27;s, William H. Kennedy, published an article in &quot;The Seattle Catholic&quot; disputing Kaiser&#x27;s allegation and other claims made about Martin after his death. Kennedy points out that Kaiser admits in his book that he was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia, and cites passages from Kaiser&#x27;s book which he believes show that Kaiser was writing from a distorted and delusional perspective due to his mental illness.
* In her 2008 book, &quot;Queen of the Oil Club: The Intrepid Wanda Jablonski and the Power of Information&quot;, Anna Rubino wrote that Martin had a love affair with oil journalist Wanda Jablonski on a visit to Beirut, Lebanon in the 1950s. The book was published long after the deaths of both Jablonski (1992) and Martin (1999).

In his last 27 years of life he had a female companion, Kakia Livanos, former wife of Greek magnate shipowner George Livanos.

===Laicization dispute===
The Traditionalist Catholic website &quot;Daily Catholic&quot; said in 2004 that Father Vincent O&#x27;Keefe, former Vicar General of the Society of Jesus and a past President of Fordham University, stated that Martin had never been laicized. According to this report, O&#x27;Keefe stated that Martin had been released from his Jesuit vows except for chastity.

Martin himself is quoted as stating that &quot;&#x27;In 1965, Mr. Martin received a dispensation from all privileges and obligations deriving from his vows as a Jesuit and from priestly ordination&#x27; (Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, 25 June 1997, Prot. N. 04300/65)&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Catholic&quot; said its 2004 statement was based on one by William Kennedy, according to which the declaration of Martin&#x27;s laicization was mounted in retaliation for his book &quot;The Jesuits&quot;, which accused the Jesuits of deviating from their original character and mission by embracing liberation theology.

===Alleged ordination as a bishop===
During a videotaped memorial titled &quot;Malachi Martin Weeps For His Church&quot;, Rama Coomaraswamy claimed that Martin had told him that he had been secretly consecrated a bishop by Pius XII. Martin&#x27;s mission was to ordain priests and bishops for the underground churches of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Coomaraswamy died in 2006.

===Alleged authorship===
* The book &quot;The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision&quot; was written by Martin under the pseudonym Michael Serafian. This was confirmed by Martin himself and corroborated independently by the Swiss Catholic dissident and priest Hans Küng. Martin related that his choice of surname, &quot;Serafian&quot;, was due to meeting a carpet dealer in Jerusalem with that name, during the trip of Paul VI to Jordan in January 1964. Serafian is a common Armenian surname.
* The pseudonym of Xavier Rynne, used to write more than 20 books on Vatican II, is not that of Martin, but of Fr. Francis X. Murphy C.Ss.R.
* The 1966 article &quot;Laures et ermitages du désert d&#x27;Egypte&quot; published in Mélanges de l&#x27;Université Saint-Joseph by the hand of &quot;M. Martin&quot; was written by Maurice Martin, not Malachi Martin.

===Joseph Roddy allegations===
Journalist Joseph Roddy alleged — in a 1966 &quot;Look Magazine&quot; article about the debate about Jews during the Second Vatican Council — that one and the same person under three different pseudonyms had written or acted on behalf of Jewish interest groups, such as the American Jewish Committee, to influence the outcome of the debates. Roddy wrote that two timely and remunerated 1965 articles were penned under the pseudonym &quot;F.E. Cartus&quot;, one for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and one for the American Jewish Committee&#x27;s magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;.

In his 2007 book &quot;Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America&quot;, Edward K. Kaplan confirmed that Martin cooperated with the American Jewish Committee during the Council &quot;for a mixture of motives, both lofty and ignoble...[He] primarily advised the committee on theological issues, but he also provided logistical intelligence and copies of restricted documents.&quot; It is confirmed in the book that Martin used the pseudonyms &quot;Forest&quot; and &quot;Pushkin&quot;. Kaplan acknowledges that &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; by Michael Serafian, was requested from Martin by Abraham J. Heschel, who arranged for the book to be published by Roger W. Straus, Jr.&#x27;s Farrar, Straus and Giroux printing company. It was published in the hope that it would influence the deliberations in the council. Once Martin&#x27;s identity as the author was revealed, it led to protests &quot;and the book had to be removed from circulation at a considerable financial loss to the publisher&quot;. Kaplan lastly states that Martin was the primary source of information for Joseph Roddy in writing his 1966 article for &quot;Look Magazine&quot;, and that &quot;O&#x27;Boyle-Fitzharris&quot; was, in fact, Martin. Kaplan judges the Roddy article as &quot;dangerously misleading [due] to the credence it gives to the claim that without organised Jewish pressure the council declaration on the Jews would not have been accepted.&quot;

Elsewhere, Martin admitted some of his work involved intelligence gathering behind the Iron Curtain and throughout the Middle East, and at times threatening cardinals with blackmail if they did not want to do what Bea and John XXIII wanted from them at the council. &quot;I saw cardinals sweating in front of me,&quot; Martin recalled. &quot;And I began to enjoy it.&quot;

===Alleged Jewish heritage===
Rumours appearing on various Catholic or sedevacantist websites and magazines alleged that Martin had Jewish ancestry that descended from Iberian Jews who migrated to Medieval Ireland and the Kingdom of England in the 15th century, and also alleged him being an Israeli spy because of his first name, &quot;Malachi&quot;, after a Hebrew prophet and his extensive travels in the Levant. These allegations were rebutted by William H. Kennedy (&quot;In Defense of Father Malachi Martin&quot;). After having made genealogical inquiries with surviving relatives of Martin in Ireland, Kennedy concluded that Martin&#x27;s father was an Englishman who moved to Ireland and that Martin&#x27;s mother was Irish on both sides. Fr. Rama Coomasrawamy confirmed this independently. The Irish language name &quot;Maélsheachlainn&quot; is usually anglicized as &quot;Malachy&quot;, and Saint Malachy was a 12th-century Irish Catholic saint.

===Alleged photograph===
Claims that Martin features as a curial monsignor in full regalia on a prominent photograph next to John Paul I and his assistant Diego Lorenzi appeared on the Internet. The photograph, published in David Yallop&#x27;s &quot;In God&#x27;s Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I&quot; as number 28 between pages 120 and 121, shows a &quot;Monsignor Martin&quot;, visibly different from Malachi Martin. This is a case of mistaken identity: the cleric in the photograph was Jacques-Paul Martin, Prefect of the Casa Pontificia from 1969 to 1986.

<doc id="858149" wikidata="Q3423475" url="?curid=858149" title="Regina Leader-Post">
<text>The Regina Leader-Post is a broadsheet newspaper published in Regina, Saskatchewan, owned by Postmedia Network.

==Founding==
The newspaper was first published as The Leader in 1883 by Nicholas Flood Davin, soon after Edgar Dewdney, Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories, decided to name the vacant and featureless site of Pile-O-Bones, renamed &quot;Regina&quot; by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, the wife of the Governor General of Canada, as territorial capital, rather than the previously-established Battleford, Troy and Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle, presumably because he had acquired ample land on the site for resale.

&quot;A group of prominent citizens approached lawyer Nicholas Flood Davin soon after his arrival in Regina and urged him to set up a newspaper. Davin accepted their offerand their $5000 in seed money. The Regina Leader printed its first edition on March 1, 1883.&quot; Published weekly by the mercurial Davin, it almost immediately achieved national prominence during the North-West Rebellion and the subsequent trial of Louis Riel. Davin had immediate access to the developing story, and his scoops were picked up by the national press and briefly brought the &quot;Leader&quot; to national prominence.

Davin&#x27;s greatest coup was sending his reporter Mary McFadyen Maclean to conduct a jailhouse interview with Riel. Maclean obtained this by masquerading as a francophone Catholic cleric and interviewing Riel in French under the nose of uncomprehending anglophone watch-house guards.

==Growth and absorbing competitors==

Having begun with a small wooden shack before Regina had full streets, or electricity and plumbing outside Government House, &quot;The Leader&quot; soon moved to a substantial office building on the southwest corner of Hamilton Street and 11th Avenue, one block east of what was then the post office, southwest across street from City Hall. Also around this time, it was acquired by the Sifton family It then moved to a multi-story building across Hamilton Street to the south of the Simpson&#x27;s department store. It ultimately relocated in the 1960s to east-city outskirts on Park Street at Victoria Avenue, where it still remains.

 In 1920, the &quot;Leader&quot; merged with another paper, the Regina Evening Post, itself in a building on Twelfth Avenue at Rose Street before the merger, and continued to publish daily editions of both before consolidating them under the title The Leader-Post in 1930. In 1922, the paper launched one of the oldest radio stations in Canada, CKCK. Five years later, the company was purchased by the Sifton family, which launched CKCK-TV, Saskatchewan&#x27;s first television station, in 1954.

Newspapers were a thriving industry in the days through television&#x27;s arrival in the 1950s until the Internet in the 1990s began to change people&#x27;s gathering of news, compounded by the merger of local companies into ownership of local companies by national multi-corporation organizations. Other titles absorbed by the &quot;Leader-Post&quot; included the Regina Daily Star and The Province.

In 1995, the &quot;Leader-Post&quot; released an electronic version of the newspaper so that subscribers could view their newspapers on the Internet. Electronic and daily print subscribers also enjoy access to extra content not available to all readers.

==Corporate ownership==
Decline of local news coverage radically occurred in 1996, when the paper and its sister, the Saskatoon &quot;StarPhoenix&quot;, were acquired from their owner based in Markham, Ontario, Armadale group, by Hollinger Inc., a company that was headed by the Canadian media baron Conrad Black. Within three months, the staffs at each newspaper had been cut by one quarter, which becoming a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in Canadian journalism. The event with substantial elimination of staff and coverage of local news corresponded with one at the Regina television station CKCK-DT, once locally owned but by 1985 no longer so.

An immediate effect was a significant reduction in coverage of local and provincial news, and a greater coverage of national events. Loss of news reporter staff, the increasing television news coverage and the arrival and growth of the internet all increased difficulty in preserving, much less increasing, the &quot;Leader-Post&quot; significance.

Black&#x27;s company subsequently divested itself of the &quot;Leader-Post&quot; in 2000, together with most other Canadian news media it had owned, in conjunction with Black&#x27;s renunciation of his Canadian citizenship to obtain a British peerage.

Eventually branding itself as the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot;, the newspaper shut down its printing facilities in 2015 in favor of being printed in Saskatoon with the press of &quot;The StarPhoenix&quot;. In 2023, Postmedia announced that the &quot;StarPhoenix&quot; press would be shut down; both the &quot;StarPhoenix&quot; and &quot;Leader-Post&quot; were to continue publication, but printed at facility in Estevan.

<doc id="858151" wikidata="Q5629653" url="?curid=858151" title="HIH Insurance">
<text>HIH Insurance was Australia&#x27;s second-largest insurance company before it was placed into provisional liquidation on 15 March 2001. The demise of HIH is considered to be the largest corporate collapse in Australia&#x27;s history, with liquidators estimating that HIH&#x27;s losses totalled up to $5.3 billion. Investigations into the cause of the collapse have led to conviction and imprisonment of a handful of members of HIH management on various charges relating to fraud. A Royal Commission was formed in the wake of the collapse. It also led to the 2002 Review of the Law of Negligence led by David Ipp and subsequent Tort reform.

==History==
In 1968, Ray Williams and Michael Payne formed M W Payne Underwriting Agency Pty Ltd, which was acquired in 1971 by British company CE Heath plc. Ray Williams was appointed to the board of CE Heath in 1980. The business operations of CE Heath were subsequently transferred to CE Heath International Holdings Limited in 1989 with CE Heath plc retaining 90% ownership of CE Heath International Holdings. In 1992, CE Heath International Holdings floated on the Australian Securities Exchange.

In 1995, CE Heath International Holdings acquired CIC Insurance Group. The remaining 48% holding that CE Heath PLC maintained in CE Heath International Holdings was sold to a subsidiary of CIC Insurance Group called CIC Holdings Limited. CIC Holdings increased its share in CE Heath International Holdings to 50% and CIC Holdings was purchased by Winterthur. In May 1996, CE Heath International Holdings changed its name to HIH Winterthur.

Through 1997 and 1998, HIH Winterthur acquired a large number of companies both in Australia and globally, including Colonial Ltd General Insurance&#x27;s operations in Australia and New Zealand, Solart in Argentina and Great States Insurance Co in the United States. Most notably, however, HIH acquired the large Australian insurance company FAI Insurance, whose chief executive Rodney Adler became a director of HIH in 1999. Winterthur Swiss sold its 51% share in HIH Winterthur to the public and HIH changed its name to HIH Insurance Limited.

==Collapse==
With $8 billion in assets, HIH was considered one of Australia&#x27;s largest insurance firms. However, after offsetting its assets with debts and potential insurance claims against the company, HIH was left, on paper, with net assets of only $133 million. McGrath &amp; Riddell described HIH&#x27;s solvency as &quot;marginal&quot; and stated in their report that &quot;an extremely small movement (just 1.7%) in the value of assets could move the balance sheet into net asset deficiency.&quot; That is, even the slightest setback would cause the company to become insolvent.

On 15 March 2001, the board of HIH appointed a provisional liquidator to take control of HIH and 17 of its controlled entities. The board hoped this would give HIH time to review its operations and assess its financial position. On the same day, HIH was to announce its first-half result for the six months to 31 December 2000. The announcement had already been delayed once and rumours suggested that HIH&#x27;s first-half result was a loss of $100 million. This figure quickly ballooned to $200 million, and then $300 million. Although the result was never announced, when Tony McGrath announced his appointment as provisional liquidator he estimated that HIH had lost over $800 million over the six months to 31 December 2000. He attributed the HIH company failures to rapid expansion, unsupervised delegation of authority, extensive and complex reinsurance arrangements, under-pricing, reserve problems, false reports, reckless management, incompetence, fraud, greed, and self-dealing.

Formal winding-up orders were made on 27 August 2001. By then, HIH liquidators estimated the deficiency of the group to be between $3.6 billion and $5.3 billion. The demise of HIH was the largest corporate failure in Australia&#x27;s history.

HIH insurance is currently in run–off, which means it is managing its outstanding claims and not writing any new business. On 11April 2011 the provisional liquidator said that it could be up to 10 years before all creditors are paid.

==Royal Commission==
On 21May 2001 Prime Minister John Howard announced that a Royal Commission would be established to inquire into the company&#x27;s collapse. Justice Neville John Owen headed the Royal Commission, which tabled its report to Parliament on 16 April 2003. The findings of the Royal Commission were available on the HIH Royal Commission web site which has been archived by the National Library of Australia.

==Criminal charges and sentences==

===Adler pleads guilty===
Former HIH director Rodney Adler was sentenced on 14 April 2005 to years in prison, with a non-parole period of years. Adler&#x27;s sentence came after pleading guilty on 16 February 2005 to four criminal charges, which included:

*two counts of disseminating information knowing it was false
*one count of obtaining money by false or misleading statements
*one count of being intentionally dishonest and failing to discharge his duties as a director in good faith and in the best interests of the company

The sentence was a lenient one, since the judge accepted the defendant&#x27;s plea of mitigation, citing that he had not sold any of his own shares, or personally benefitted from his actions.

====Stock market manipulation====
Criminal charges for stock market manipulation were laid against Adler after an investigation by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) into the purchase of HIH shares by Pacific Eagle Equities Pty Ltd, an Adler-controlled company. Pacific Eagle Equities purchased 1,873,661 HIH shares on 15 June 2000, 951,339 HIH shares on 16 June 2000 and 425,000 HIH shares on 19 June 2000 with HIH funds after Adler persuaded Ray Williams to shift $10 million from HIH to Pacific Eagle Equities. Adler&#x27;s defence team negotiated with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to drop charges of stock market manipulation in exchange for a guilty plea to other charges.

====Disseminating false information====
Adler attempted to induce investors to purchase HIH shares by telling a finance journalist on 19 June 2000 and 20 June 2000 that he had purchased 1,873,661 HIH shares on 15 June 2000 and 951,339 HIH shares on 16 June 2000 for himself. Adler also told the journalist that he believed the share price for HIH was undervalued and presented an opportunity for a quick profit.

====Intentionally acting dishonestly ====
In October 2000, a company in which Adler had an interest, Business Thinking Systems (BTS), was in financial trouble. Adler sought a $2 million investment from HIH. Williams had been told by Adler that the company had raised $2.5 million, which it had not, and that Adler was prepared to invest $500,000, which he had no intention of doing, if HIH invested $2 million in BTS. HIH executive John Ballhausen was then told by Adler that he had invested the $500,000. The HIH board discussed and approved the $2 million investment in BTS in a November 2000 meeting. Adler attended the meeting and failed to disclose his financial interest in the business. Nor did he disclose his knowledge of its financial affairs. In April 2005 Adler was sentenced to years in prison.

On 13 October 2007, Adler was released from the St Heliers Correctional Centre in the Hunter Valley on parole, after serving years of his sentence. However, in November 2007, he faced court in a NSW civil case related to bonuses he recommended for executives of the failed telco One.Tel. Adler was on One.Tel&#x27;s remuneration committee.

===Other charges===
On 15 April 2005, Ray Williams was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months&#x27; jail with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, after pleading guilty to misleading shareholders about the financial position of HIH. Williams was also banned from leading an Australian corporation for ten years. On 14 January 2008, Williams was released from jail after serving just under three years.

Sydney businessman Brad Cooper was sentenced in the Supreme Court on 23 June 2006, after a jury found him guilty on 13 charges relating to bribes he paid a senior HIH official to push through false claims in the months before the insurer&#x27;s collapse. He was sentenced to 8 years&#x27; jail with a non-parole period of 5 years. Cooper reportedly admitted to having a cocaine addiction during his high-flying days when he worked as a motivational speaker and as a salesman. At the time he entered jail in October 2005, Australian media stated he reported to prison officials that he had further addictions to painkillers, dex-amphetamines, and was on a valium addiction program. Prior to his arrest, he had begun a relationship with Sascha Ricci Griffin, and she continued their relationship with visits to him in court and jail, until his release in late 2010. Cooper filed an appeal from jail against the severity of his sentence, but the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the application in March 2009.

On 21 November 2008, it was reported that a charge had been dropped against former HIH chairman Geoffrey Cohen a week before it was due to be heard in Sydney&#x27;s Downing Centre Local Court. The decision by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions not to proceed followed a similar decision in February 2008 relating to a more serious charge. Both were laid in 2005. Both abandoned charges related to Cohen&#x27;s address to shareholders at the HIH annual general meeting in December 2000. In the second charge, ASIC alleged Cohen did not take reasonable steps to ensure that the information he gave to the shareholders at annual meeting was not misleading about a joint venture between Allianz Australia Ltd (Allianz) and HIH. The first charge alleged Cohen knowingly misled investors.

<text>The Asquith was a short-lived English automobile manufactured by William Asquith at his Halifax machine tool works from 1901 to 1902. The car originally had a front-mounted De Dion engine and belt-drive; this last was later replaced by a two-speed gearbox because the belts kept slipping disastrously. Probably only one example of the car was built before the firm decided to concentrate on the production of boring machinery.

<doc id="858153" wikidata="Q738226" url="?curid=858153" title="Asquith Motors">
<text>Asquith Motors is an English commercial vehicle manufacturer of hand built replicas since 1981 and originally based in Braintree, Essex. The company was founded by Bruce West, who designed the logo, created the name and designed all the early vehicles. His concept was to create modern vehicles with the potential of mass advertising through the appeal of historic vehicles. In 1984, West sold the moulds to Hunnable Holdings of Yeldham, Great Yeldham, Essex.

Mr West started building &quot;retro-style&quot; delivery vans on the Ford Transit chassis in 1982. In 1991, the company announced production of a 1930s-style taxi cab that would meet the London Public Carriage Office regulations on a purpose-built chassis.

Originally based in Braintree in Essex, Asquith employed 30 full-time craftsmen who handmade over 1,000 vehicles, many exported to countries as far away as Paraguay, Japan and USA, though Germany has always been the biggest export market.

In the late 1990s after the sale to Hunnables, the company experienced some challenges. The cost of manufacture had increased, research and development on new vehicles including the London Taxi had spiralled and a large Japanese order was cancelled due to increases in the exchange rate. The company was forced into receivership.

The company was purchased from the liquidators by Mike Edgar in 1997. He built a team of designers led by Paul Keegan and engineers led by Eddie Parsons. Further investment was required to move the company forward and Edgar soon found that UK manufacture was too expensive and sought partnerships in other countries. At the time, relationships were established with third-party companies in Barcelona (Spain) and Katowice (Poland).

In 2003, the molds and intellectual property rights were purchased by Simon Rhodes and Asquith Motors was established to develop new versions of the original vehicles. Due to various quality, language and distance issues with the overseas companies, it was decided to stop them manufacturing further vehicles.

In 2005, Asquith Motors bought the assets of the &#x27;Vintage Motor Company Ltd&#x27;, based in Doncaster. The main assets included The Royale Windsor (a 1940s-style limousine) and The Royale Sabre (a 1940s-style sports car). These are due to manufactured in the future.
In 2009, Asquith Motors appointed John Barlow, a well known and respected car designer and engineer, to develop new moulds for the Shire and Mascot, to be based on the Iveco Daily chassis.
Launch of these vehicles was due in early 2010 and enquiries had been received from companies all over the world, who appreciated the classic style to advertise their business. No such model was ever produced though.
As of September 2020, the website claims to have three new products in development; The Mascot eight seater bus, the smaller Shetland electric van and numerous vintage style trailers. These will be based on Iveco Daily commercial vehicles. No official launch date is set, apart from a twitter post in June 2019 announcing that the &quot;New Asquith Shire is coming soon...&quot;.

<doc id="858154" wikidata="Q175299" url="?curid=858154" title="Fath-Ali Shah Qajar">
<text>Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (; May 1769 – 24 October 1834) was the second Shah of Qajar Iran. He reigned from 17 June 1797 until his death on 24 October 1834. His reign saw the irrevocable ceding of Iran&#x27;s northern territories in the Caucasus, comprising what is nowadays Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, to the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 and the resulting treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay. These two treaties are closely tied to Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s legacy amongst Iranians, who often view him as a weak ruler.

Fath-Ali Shah successfully revamped his realm from a mostly Turkic tribal khanship into a centralized and stable monarchy based on the old imperial design. At the end of his reign, his difficult economic problems and military and technological liabilities took Iran to the verge of governmental disintegration, which was quickened by a consequent struggle for the throne after his death.

Under Fath-Ali Shah, many visual portrayals of himself and his court were created in an effort to commend the crown. The notable ones include rock reliefs next to the ones erected under the pre-Islamic Sasanian Empire (224–651) in Ray, Fars and Kermanshah. This was done so that he could represent himself as heir to the ancient Persian empire to his countryfolk and the generations that followed.

==Early life==
He was born in May 1769 in the city of Damghan, then under the governorship of his father. He was called Fath-Ali, a name borne by his prominent great-grandfather, Fath-Ali Khan Qajar. But he was mainly known by his second name of Baba Khan until his coronation in 1797. However, the Russians still called him Baba Khan until 1813, as they refused to recognize his rule. He was the eldest son of Hossein Qoli Khan Qajar (the brother of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar) and the daughter of the Mohammad Agha Ezz al-Dinlu of the Ashaqa-bash branch of the Qajar tribe. Due to Hossein Qoli Khan being suspected of plotting to rebel against the Zand dynasty, Baba Khan (then aged five) was sent as a hostage to the court of the Zand ruler Karim Khan Zand () in Shiraz. There Baba Khan joined his uncle Agha Mohammad Khan, who was also a hostage at the court.

Baba Khan later returned to Damghan (according to the 19th-century Iranian writer Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat, this took place in 1775), where he was witness to the conflict amongst the Davallu Qajar chiefs of Astarabad, which ultimately led to the murder of his father by the Kuklan Turkmens in 1777. Baba Khan sought shelter with his uncle Morteza Qoli Khan Qajar in the village of Anzan (near Astarabad), where he stayed for two years. Following the death of Karim Khan in 1779, Baba Khan shifted his allegiance to Agha Mohammad Khan, who had returned to Mazandaran and overpowered Morteza Qoli and two other brothers in Barforush. Albeit Agha Mohammad Khan had been castrated at a young age, he married Baba Khan&#x27;s mother in Sari and practically became his stepfather and guardian.

In 1780, Baba Khan and Agha Mohammad Khan were captured in Baforush by the latter&#x27;s brother Rezaqoli Khan Qajar, who was displeased of the favour that Baba Khan received by Agha Mohammad Khan. They were eventually released, and in 1781 Baba Khan seized Damghan from Qader Khan Arab Bestami, thus recovering his father&#x27;s former domain. Baba Khan also captured and married Qader Khan&#x27;s daughter Badr Jahan. In 1783, Baba Khan married his first Qajar wife, Asiya Khanom Devellu in Sari. The marriage was a political union organized by Agha Mohammad Khan to make peace with the Yokhari-bash branch of the Qajars, the clan of Asiya Khanom. Following Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s accession to the throne at Tehran on 21 March 1786, Baba Khan was designated as his heir and vice-regent.

Baba Khan took part in his uncle&#x27;s war with the Zands in southern Iran, where he in 1787 narrowly succeeded in defeating the governor of Yazd, Mohammad-Taqi Bafqi, who acknowledged Qajar suzerainty. Baba Khan then went to Gilan to protect it against Qajar chiefs whose loyalty was questionable.

Baba Khan was governor of Fars when his uncle was assassinated in 1797. Baba Khan then ascended the throne and used the name of Fath Ali Shah (with the word &quot;shah&quot; added to his name). He became suspicious of his chancellor Ebrahim Khan Kalantar and ordered his execution. Hajji Ebrahim Khan had been chancellor to Zand and Qajar rulers for some fifteen years. Much of his reign was marked by the resurgence of Persian arts and painting, as well as a deeply elaborate court culture with extremely rigid etiquette. In particular during his reign, portraiture and large-scale oil painting reached a height previously unknown under any other Islamic dynasty, largely due to his personal patronage.

Fath Ali also ordered the creation of much royal regalia, including coronation chairs; the &quot;Takht-e Khurshīd&quot; or Sun Throne; the &quot;Takht-e Nāderi&quot; or Naderi Throne, which was also used by later kings; and the &quot;Tāj-e Kiyāni&quot; or Kiani Crown, a modification of the crown of the same name created by his uncle Agha Mohammad Khan. The latter, like most of his regalia, was studded with a large number of pearls and gems.

In 1797, Fath Ali was given a complete set of the &quot;Britannica&#x27;s&quot; 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include &quot;Most Formidable Lord and Master of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.&quot; In 1803, Fath-Ali Shah appointed his cousin Ebrahim Khan as the governor of the Kerman province, which had been devastated during the reign of Agha Mohammad Khan.

In Khorasan, there would be a growing revolt led by Nader Mirza, who would restore the Afsharid dynasty. The Shah&#x27;s control was so limited in fact that an 1800–1801 tax register listed only Sabzevar and Neyshabur as paying taxes to the government, while the rest of the local Khorasani leaders paid no taxes to the state at all.

==Russo-Persian Wars (1804–1828)==
===Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)===
During the early reign of Fath Ali Shah, Imperial Russia took control of Georgia, a territory which Iran had ruled intermittently since 1555 with the Peace of Amasya. Georgia, led by Heraclius II, had forged an alliance with Iran&#x27;s rival, Russia, following the Treaty of Georgievsk. To punish his Georgian subjects, his uncle, Agha Mohammad Khan, had invaded and sacked Tbilisi, seeking to reestablish full Iranian suzerainty over Georgia, in which he succeeded. Even though the Russian garrisons in the city had to retreat, Iran did not manage to put back all of its needed garrisons over the country as Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated soon afterwards in Shusha, following with Russia&#x27;s act of annexation of those priorly-Iranian ruled parts of Georgia in 1801, after many Georgian embassies and a treaty. Also, not only was Georgia annexed but Dagestan was also invaded, which had also been under Iranian rule since the early Safavid era. As it was seen as a direct intrusion into Iranian territory, Fath Ali Shah, determined to reassert Iranian hegemony over the whole region, declared war on Russia after General Pavel Tsitsianov attacked and stormed the city of Ganja, massacring many of its inhabitants and forcing many thousands to flee deeper within the Iranian domains. In 1804, Fath Ali Shah ordered the invasion of Georgia in order to regain it, under pressure from the Shia clergy, who were urging a war against Russia. The war began with notable victories for the Iranians, but Russia shipped in advanced weaponry and cannons that disadvantaged the technologically inferior Qajar forces, who did not have the artillery to match. Russia continued with a major campaign against Iran; Iran asked for help from Britain on the grounds of a military agreement with that country (the military agreement was signed after the rise of Napoleon in France). However, Britain refused to assist Iran claiming that the military agreement concerned a French attack not Russian.

Iran had to ask for help from France, sending an ambassador to Napoleon and concluding a Franco-Persian alliance with the signature of the Treaty of Finkenstein. However, just when the French were ready to help Iran, Napoleon made peace with Russia. At this time, John Malcolm arrived in Iran and promised support but Britain later changed its mind and asked Iran to retreat. Though many years the war had been stale and located in various parts of Transcaucasia, the peace with Napoleon enabled the Russians to increase their war efforts in the Caucasus against Iran. In early 1813, under General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky, the Russians successfully stormed Lankaran. Russian troops invaded Tabriz in 1813 and Iran was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan with Russia.

====Treaty of Gulistan====
On account of consecutive defeats of Iran and after the fall of Lankaran on 1 January 1813, Fath Ali Shah, was forced to sign the disastrous Treaty of Gulistan. The text of treaty was prepared by a British diplomat; Sir Gore Ouseley; and was signed by Nikolai Fyodorovich Rtischev from the Russian side and Hajji Mirza Abol Hasan Khan from the Iranian side on 24 October 1813 in the village of Gulistan.

By this treaty all of the cities, towns, and villages of Georgia, villages and towns on the coast of the Black Sea, all of the cities, towns and villages of the Khanates in the South Caucasus and North Caucasus, and part of the Talysh Khanate, including Megrelia, Abkhazia, Imeretia, Guria, Baku khanate, Shirvan Khanate, Derbent, Karabakh khanate, Ganja khanate, Shaki Khanate and Quba Khanate became part of Russia. These territories altogether comprise modern-day Georgia, southern Dagestan, and most of the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic. In return, Russia pledged to support Abbas Mirza as heir to the Iranian throne after the death of Fath Ali Shah.

===Interlude on a different front===
Between 1805 and 1816, Qajar rulers began invading Herat in neighboring Afghanistan with small detachments. The Iranians were attempting to retake control of the city but were forced to abandon it due to Afghan uprisings. In 1818 the Shah sent his son Mohammad Vali Mirza to capture the city but he was defeated at the Battle of Kafir Qala.

===Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)===

In 1826, 13 years after the Treaty of Gulistan, the Shah, on the advice of British agents and the utter dissatisfaction with the outcome of the previous war, decided to occupy the lost territories. Crown prince Abbas Mirza, head of the armies, invaded the Talysh Khanate and Karabakh khanate with an army of 35,000 on 16 July 1826. The first year of the war was very successful, and the Iranians managed to regain most of their lost territories of the 1804–1813 war, including the principal cities of Lenkoran, Quba, and Baku. However the tide turned after the winter. In May 1827, Ivan Paskevich, Governor of Caucasus, invaded Echmiadzin, Nakhichevan, Abbasabad and on 1 October Erivan. Fourteen days later, General Eristov entered Tabriz. In January 1828, when the Russians reached the shores of Lake Urmia, Abbas Mirza urgently signed the Treaty of Turkmenchay on 2 February 1828.

====Treaty of Turkmenchay====

The Turkmenchay Treaty was signed on 21 February 1828 by Hajji Mirza Abol Hasan Khan and General Ivan Paskevich. By this treaty the Erivan khanate (most of present-day Armenia, and also a small part of Eastern Anatolia), Nakhchivan khanate (most of the present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan), the Talysh Khanate (southeastern Azerbaijan), and the Ordubad and Mughan came under the rule of Imperial Russia. By this treaty, Iran had lost all of its Caucasian territories comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan to neighboring Imperial Russia. Iran furthermore pledged to pay Russia 10 Million in Gold, and in return Russia pledged to support Abbas Mirza as heir to the Iranian throne after the death of Fath Ali Shah. The treaty also stipulated the resettlement of Armenians from Iran to the Caucasus, which also included an outright liberation of Armenian captives who were brought and had lived in Iran since 1804 or as far back as 1795.

==Later life==

Fath Ali later employed writers and painters to make a book about his wars with Russia, inspired by the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. This book, considered by many to be the most important Persian book written in the Qajar period, is called the Shahanshahnama.

In 1829, Alexander Griboyedov, the Russian diplomat and playwright was killed in the Massacre at the Russian Embassy in Tehran. To apologize, the Shah sent prince Khosrow Mirza to Tsar Nicholas I to deliver a formal apology, as well as one of the biggest diamonds of his crown jewelry, namely the Shah Diamond.

When his favourite son and crown prince Abbas Mirza died on 25 October 1833, Fath Ali named his grandson Mohammed Mirza as his crown prince. Fath Ali died a year later, on 24 October 1834. He was buried in a tomb in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine of Qom.

He is instantly recognizable in all 25 known portraits – mainly due to his immense, deeply black beard, which reached well beneath his narrow waist. One of these portraits is being exhibited in the collection of the University of Oxford. Another one, by the artist, Mihr Ali, is at the Brooklyn Museum.

Besides eulogistic chronicles, the only real sources that allow us to judge his personality are those of British, French and Russian diplomats . These vary greatly: earlier in his reign they tend to portray him as vigorous, manly and highly intelligent. Later they begin to point out his extreme indolence and avarice. The image of decadence was epitomised by the story that he had a special harem slide of marble constructed. Every day he would lie on his back naked &quot;as, one by one, naked harem beauties swooped down a slide, specially made for the sport, into the arms of their lord and master before being playfully dunked in a pool.&quot;
== Titles ==

Fath-Ali Shah used both the ancient Persian title of &quot;shahanshah&quot; (King of Kings), i.e., Emperor, and the Turco-Mongol title of &quot;khaqan&quot; (&quot;khan&quot; of &quot;khans&quot;), thus representing himself as both ruler of the country and the tribes.

== Appearance ==
Fath-Ali Shah was the last Qajar shah to dress in the traditional manner, which included a decorated Persian long robe, high heels, and a long beard. The Scottish statesman and historian John Malcolm, who met Fath-Ali Shah in 1800, described him as &quot;above the middle size, his age little more than thirty, his complexion rather fair, his features regular and fine, with an expression denoting quickness and intelligence.&quot;

== Legacy ==
During his reign, Fath-Ali Shah successfully revamped his realm from a mostly Turkic tribal khanship into a centralized and stable monarchy based on the old imperial design.

==Marriage and children==

Fath-Ali Shah is reported to have had more than 1,000 spouses. He was survived by fifty-seven sons and forty-six daughters, along with 296 grandsons and 292 granddaughters.

A book published in England in 1874 provided different numbers:

&quot;It is believed that Fetteh Ali had the largest number of children ever born to a man. Like a pious Mohammedan, he had only four wives, but his harem generally contained from 800 to 1,000 ladies. By these he had 130 sons and 150 daughters, and it is believed that at the time of his death his descendants numbered &quot;five thousand souls&quot;. The three grandsons who merit notice were the sons of Hussein Ali, the governor of Fars, who aspired to the throne. The princes, Riza Kuli Mirza, Nejeff Kuli Mirza, and Timour Mirza, were at Shiraz when their father attempted to seize the throne. They were able to make their escape from the city.&quot;

While this is a large number of children, the claim that Fatḥ-ʻAli holds the record is not true. (Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, who lived a hundred years earlier in Morocco, is said to hold the record for the most number of children born to a man.)

Fatḥ-Ali&#x27;s first son, Mohammad Ali Mirza Dowlat Shah, was seven months older than the second son Abbas Mirza. Yet it was the latter who was named &quot;Wali-ahd&quot; or crown prince. This was because Dowlat Shah&#x27;s mother, Ziba Chehreh Khanoum, was of non-Qajar origin (she was a Georgian woman), and therefore he was passed over in favour of his younger brother.

<text>José María Gil-Robles y Gil-Delgado (17 June 1935 – 13 February 2023) was a Spanish lawyer and politician. He was a Member of the European Parliament in the European People&#x27;s Party group, and was President of the European Parliament from 1997 to 1999.

==Early life==
José María Gil-Robles was born on 17 June 1935 in Madrid, during the Spanish Second Republic. He was the son of José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones, leader of the CEDA and a prominent figure in the period leading up to the Spanish Civil War, and Carmen Gil-Delgado Armada. Thus, he was grandson of Carlist theorist Enrique Gil Robles and brother of Álvaro Gil-Robles, who was the second Ombudsman of Spain between 1988 and 1993.

Due to the Civil War, the family went into exile in Estoril, Portugal. Gil-Robles, in 1953, returned to Spain to study Law at the University of Deusto, from which he graduated with an Extraordinary Prize. In 1959 he became a lawyer in the Francoist Courts, a position he held during the Spanish transition to democracy and the democratic Congress of the Deputies. was also editor of the &quot;Boletín de Legislación extranjera&quot; (Foreign Legislation Bulletin) and between 1959 and 1964 he was a professor of Political Law at the Complutense University of Madrid. Between 1959 and 1997 and from 1999 onwards he practiced law and since 1974 he has published several legal works related to the restoration of democracy and to parliamentary and public law. In 2004 Gil-Robles obtained the &quot;Jean Monnet&quot; Chair at the Complutense University of Madrid.

==Political career==

In 1989, and after the re-foundation of People&#x27;s Party, Marcelino Oreja asked Gil-Robles to accompany him in the candidacy for the 1989 European Parliament election. Gil-Robles was elected member of the European Parliament in the elections that took place in July, as part of the European People&#x27;s Party, party of which he was vice-president between 1990 and 1992.

In 1994, after being re-elected MEP in the 1994 election, was appointed Vice-President of the European Parliament, a position he held until 1997. In January of that year he was elected President of the European Parliament after obtaining a large majority of 338 votes, office he held until 1999. This position allowed him to play a key role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, treaty that expanded the powers of the European Parliament. He also oversaw the beginning of negotiations of the accession of new state members to the European Union, and the approval of the Agenda 2000. He also had to manage the institutional crisis after the resignation of the Santer Commission.

In the 1999 European Parliament election Gil-Robles was reelected member of the European Parliament and succeeded on 20 July by Nicole Fontaine as its president. In the 2004 elections he no longer repeated as an MEP.

Gil-Robles was president of the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe between 2009 and 2014.

==Personal life and death==

He was married with Magdalena Casanueva, with whom he had four children.

Gil-Robles died on 13 February 2023, at the age of 87.

==Honors==
*Robert Schuman Medal, EPP Group (1995).
*Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (2000). and the Grand Cross of Civil Merit (Spain).

<doc id="858158" wikidata="Q28048" url="?curid=858158" title="Raoul Island">
<text>Raoul Island (&quot;Sunday Island&quot;; ) is the largest and northernmost of the main Kermadec Islands, south south-west of &#x27;Ata Island of Tonga and north north-east of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It has been the source of vigorous volcanic activity during the past several thousand years that was dominated by dacitic explosive eruptions, with the largest being VEI-6.

The area of the anvil-shaped island, including fringing islets and rocks mainly in the northeast, but also a few smaller ones in the southeast, is . The highest elevation is Moumoukai Peak, at an elevation of .

Although Raoul is the only island in the Kermadec group large enough to support settlement, it lacks a safe harbour, and landings from small boats can be made only in calm weather. The island consists of two mountainous areas, one with summits of and , and the other with a summit of , the two separated by a depression which is the caldera of the Raoul volcano.

==History==
Evidence from archaeological sites on the northern coast of Raoul Island indicate that Polynesians settled there in the 14th century. A 1980 publication also suggested a lower layer of deposits dated to the 10th century, but this was rejected by the paper&#x27;s author in 1991 in favour of the later date. Finds at the sites included stone implements of the Polynesian type, obsidian flakes, shells and charcoal. Obsidian of the same type has been found at early Māori sites at Shag River / Waihemo and Tai Rua, Otago on the South Island of New Zealand. There are also similarities to the Raoul settlement at archaic sites at Houhora and Papatowai. Higham and Johnson (1997) concluded that Raoul was settled from New Zealand but that the Kermadecs were a stepping stone in an early and rapid Polynesian migration from Polynesia to New Zealand and back although the occupation of the islands was relatively brief.
The island was uninhabited when first sighted by Western sailors and was named after Joseph Raoul, quartermaster of the &quot;Recherche&quot;, when it was sighted on 16 March 1793. Captain William Raven of the whaleship &quot;Britannia&quot; sighted the island on 6 March 1796 and called it Sunday Island, a name which was subsequently in common usage. Captain Henry Mangles Denham of HMS &quot;Herald&quot; charted the island in 1854.

The last regular occupants, Tom Bell and his wife Frederica, spent thirty-six years on the island before the New Zealand government evacuated them in 1914. A landing party sent to investigate the island found out how hasty the evacuation of the Bells was – a 1914 calendar was still pinned to the kitchen wall and the family&#x27;s furniture, cutlery, and child&#x27;s toys had remained in place. The family arrived with six children and five more were born there.

From 27 May to 16 June 1917, the German raider &quot;Wolf&quot;, under the command of Korvettenkapitän Karl August Nerger, anchored in the protected bay to undertake engine overhaul and maintenance. During this period &quot;Wolf&quot; captured the New Zealand steamship &quot;Wairuna&quot; (3,950 tons) and the American sailing bark &quot;Winslow&quot; (570 tons), commandeering all cargo and coal from both ships.

===Weather station===
The New Zealand government has permanently staffed Raoul Island since 1937 until the evacuation of staff at the beginning of 2020 due to uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic. It included a government meteorological and radio station and hostel for Department of Conservation (DOC) officers and volunteers. The station stands on the northern terraces of the island, about in elevation above the cliffs of Fleetwood Bluff.

The meteorological station (WMO ID 93997) was initially operated by NZ Post Office staff operating the aeradio station, but shortly after the end of World War 2, the New Zealand Meteorological Service took over the running of the station, with nine full-time staff. Each team undertook 12-month expeditions to the island to provide three hourly weather reports and once daily radiosonde flights using hydrogen filled balloons at 10:30am. Weather reports were radioed back to New Zealand using HF radio to ZLW Wellington Radio.

In addition to its primary purpose as a meteorological station, staff at the station also maintained a seismic monitoring station, made once a week measurements of sea temperature at Fishing Rock and the lake levels and temperatures of Blue and Green Lakes.

In 1990 the surface weather observation programme was automated and the Dept of Conservation took over responsibility for operational activities on the island.

Raoul Island Station remains the northernmost outpost of New Zealand.

===2006 eruption – Mark Kearney===
On 17 March 2006 at 8:21a.m. NZDT, a 40-second long volcanic eruption occurred at the Green Lake. At the time, Mark Kearney, a DOC worker, was at the crater taking water temperature measurements. A area around Green Lake was affected with ash, mud and boulders. Two DOC workers were forced to turn back after going to the crater to search for Kearney.

Following the eruption, DOC decided to evacuate the remaining five staff members. A Mil Mi-8 helicopter and Piper PA-31 Navajo aircraft took off from Taupō at 11a.m. that morning. They arrived at the island in the late afternoon and undertook a 45-minute search for Kearney, but no sign was seen. The evacuated staff members were brought back to Auckland that evening.

A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion made an overflight on 21 March to provide further information on how safe it was to approach Green Lake. The volcanologists aboard decided the area was still unsafe, and that the crater lake had risen by about compared to measurements taken on 17 March. There was no cloud or ash plume.

A group of police, the five evacuated workers, three other DOC staff and scientific staff left Tauranga on 18 March for the three-day boat trip to Raoul aboard the RV &quot;Braveheart&quot; to recover Kearney&#x27;s body. They were able to undertake a limited search, but decided that it was extremely unlikely that Kearney survived given the amount of devastation in the area around Green Lake. The &quot;Braveheart&quot; began the journey back to the mainland on 25 March, with three of the DOC workers staying on the island to continue research. The three were joined by the other four evacuated workers at the start of May 2006. Two of the three will return to the mainland after the handover.

Five hours after the eruption, the Aura satellite passed over and found an estimated of sulfur dioxide had been released. This confirmed that there were magmatic gases in the eruption, and the presence of degassing magma within the volcano. By the end of April, the activity in the area had decreased significantly and the &quot;Alert Level&quot; was lowered to 1.

HMNZS &quot;Te Mana&quot; left for Raoul on 24 August 2006 on a resupply mission. Also on board were Kearney&#x27;s sister, Merryn McDermott; three representatives of the Ngāti Kurī iwi; and Chris Carter, the Minister of Conservation. During a service held on 28 August, the Ngāti Kurī representatives performed a tapu lifting ceremony. A plaque was erected to honour Kearney. &quot;Te Mana&quot; also allowed some volcanic monitoring to be undertaken using its SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopter. During a dawn flight, sample bottles were filled with crater lake water.

A report by the New Zealand Department of Labour into the death was released on 14 October 2006. It cleared the Department of Conservation and the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Ltd of any negligence related to the death of Kearney. The report stated that the eruption was unpredictable and there was no indication of imminent seismic activity.

Located on an active margin between two tectonic plates, the Kermadec Islands also experience frequent earthquakes, the most recently significant of which occurred at 19:28:31 UTC on 4 March 2021. The epicentre occurred south of Raoul and measured 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale, and as such is classified as a &#x27;major&#x27; earthquake by the United States Geological Survey. Also of note on 31 January 2007 at 4:15:55 NZST a Magnitude 6.5 (Strong) earthquake shook the island. The epicentre was approximately S of Raoul and below the seabed. On 9 December 2007 at 8:28pm NZST a magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the area, centred approximately north of Raoul Island at a depth of . On 30 September 2008 at 3:19:31 NZST a magnitude 7.0 earthquake centred S of Raoul occurred, with an approximate depth of . More recently on 22 October 2011 at 05:57:17 NZST a Magnitude 7.4 earthquake originating at 28.941S 176.045W at a depth of 39 km occurred according to the United States Geological Survey.

===July 2011 earthquake===
7 July 2011 – 7:03am. A 7.6 Magnitude earthquake occurred at a depth of 24 km, 211 km east of Raoul Island. 7 July 2011 – 8:51am Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre scientist Barry Hirshorn told Newstalk ZB the quake generated a 1.9 metre tsunami at Raoul Island.

===October 2011 earthquake===

22 October 2011 – 5:57pm. A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred at a depth of , east of Raoul Island.

The Ministry of Civil Defence had issued the advisory while it assessed the severity of the threat to New Zealand. The Ministry was warning people in coastal areas to stay off beaches and out of the water. People were advised to avoid sightseeing and remain on alert in case the earthquake had generated a tsunami, however by mid-morning warnings had lifted.

Department of Conservation volunteer Mihai Muncus-Nagy, a 33-year-old biologist from Romania, went missing on Raoul Island on 2 January 2012. He had gone to Raoul at the end of October 2011. His vehicle and gear were found close to where he had been carrying out water temperature readings on the morning of 2 January 2012.

The remaining staff and volunteers searched the shore, but found no further sign of him. A helicopter was sent to Raoul by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ) from Taupō to carry out an aerial search. A DOC boat was also used in the search.

Muncus-Nagy was presumed drowned. Auckland District Court later found the Department of Conservation culpable in his death for failing to ensure his safety.

===March 2021 earthquake===

4 March 2021 – 08:28 local time. An 8.1 magnitude earthquake occurred at a depth of , east of Raoul Island. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the island was uninhabited at the time. The earthquake led to a tsunami warning for much of New Zealand, and evacuation of some coastal regions of the North Island.

==Geography==
The island is about northeast of Auckland and its location means it is a convenient earthquake and tsunami monitoring station for several Pacific nations. Two Holocene calderas are found at Raoul. The older caldera, which cuts the centre of Raoul Island, is about long and wide respectively. Denham caldera, formed during a major dacitic explosive eruption about 2200 years ago, truncated the western side of the island and is long and wide respectively.

The Denham caldera was named for the nearby Denham Bay, itself named by Royal Navy Captain Henry Mangles Denham in HMS &quot;Herald&quot;, who came to complete a (chart) survey of the island on 2 July 1854. His son Fleetwood James Denham (16yrs) died from a tropical fever, and was buried near the beach at the head of Denham Bay, where a number of the grass-grown graves of former settlers were. The brass plaque heading this grave has been preserved.

Three small lakes, Blue Lake (, about 40% overgrown), Green Lake () and Tui Lake (, drinking water quality) are located in the northern caldera of Raoul Island. The floor of the caldera surrounding the lakes is called Pumice Flats.

===Climate===
Raoul Island has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) close to the border of tropical climate (&quot;Af&quot;). On 12 February 2022, the minimum temperature in the Raoul Island was 25.6 °C, this is the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in New Zealand.

=== Geology ===
Raoul Island is a stratovolcano on the Tonga–Kermadec Ridge which is a back-arc volcanic chain associated with the 4 to 5 million year old Kermadec–Tonga subduction zone. Its formative lavas have erupted over at least the last 1.5 million years and range from basaltic to rhyolitic in composition. There was a change from predominantly basaltic and andesitic volcanism to the more silicic dacite and rhyolitic volcanism about 3700 years ago.

The Raoul volcano massif is over twice the area of the island extending off the seafloor and has a total volume of . Denham caldera&#x27;s long axis is parallel to the tectonic fabric of the Havre Trough that lies west of the volcanic arc. There is a large undersea caldera about to the northeast of the island in the volcanic edifice.

About south of Raoul Island is a separate submarine volcanic edifice referred to as Raoul SW, and further on the volcanic Macauley Island.

Historical eruptions at Raoul during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both of the island&#x27;s calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera. A high unnamed submarine cone, one of several located along a fissure on the lower NNE flank of Raoul volcano, has also erupted during historical time, and satellite vents at Raoul are concentrated along two parallel NNE-trending lineaments. 
=== Volcanic risk ===
Immediate volcanic risk at Raoul is confined to any who are on the island at the time, or shipping in the vicinity. However larger eruptions could pose a serious danger to aircraft on commercial routes and generate tsunami. The eruption of about 250 BCE was about the same size as the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa.

==Flora and fauna==

The scientific categorisation of the flora and fauna of the island began in 1854 when , captained by Henry Mangles Denham, arrived to complete the charting of the island. He arrived on the 2nd and was occupied till 24 July, during which time he frequently had to move the ship on account of the rough weather experienced. William Grant Milne and John MacGillivray, naturalists on board the &quot;Herald&quot;, made a small collection of plants on Raoul. This was forwarded by Captain Denham to Sir W. Hooker, and was described by Sir Joseph Hooker in the &quot;Journal of the Linnean Society&quot; for 1857.

A scientific expedition was undertaken by a group of naturalists to the Kermadec Islands in 1908. The expedition established its base at Denham Bay. During that expedition one of the naturalists, W. L. Wallace, discovered numerous new insect species including the beetle Saprosites raoulensis.

Raoul is part of the Kermadec Islands subtropical moist forests ecoregion and is largely covered with closed-canopy forest, predominantly of the evergreen Kermadec pōhutukawa (&quot;Metrosideros kermadecensis&quot;) and the Kermadec nikau palm (&quot;Rhopalostylis baueri&quot;, formerly described as &quot;Rhopalostylis cheesemanii&quot;). It is just far enough south that the occasional fertile coconut from Polynesia that washes up on shore and takes root will not survive in the longterm due to a lack of warmth. The island has no native land mammals and was formerly home to vast colonies of seabirds who nested in the forests. The islands may once have had a species of megapode (based on early settler records) and a subspecies of kererū. Currently, landbirds on the island include the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet (&quot;Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae cyanurus&quot;), the Australasian harrier, pūkeko, tūī and several introduced species. The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds.

Polynesian visitors introduced the Polynesian rat in the 14th century and Norway rats, cats and goats were introduced by European and American visitors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The rats and cats greatly reduced the seabird colonies, which mostly withdrew to offshore islets, and exterminated the red-crowned parakeet, the last confirmed record of resident parakeets for over a century being made in 1836. Although the goats did not eliminate the tree canopy as they did on other islands, they greatly reduced the understorey vegetation and were removed in 1986. The Department of Conservation eradicated rats and cats between 2002 and 2006, following which red-crowned parakeets soon returned naturally, presumably from the Herald Islets, away. The parakeets had been absent from the island for 150 years and their natural return was a notable event in parrot conservation.

There are numerous invasive plant species on the island and a large scale weeding programme involving teams of DOC workers and volunteers has been under way for a number of years in an attempt to eradicate them. Myrtle Rust has been found on the island in 2017.

The island is part of the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve, New Zealand&#x27;s largest marine reserve, which was created in 1990.

<doc id="858161" wikidata="Q47066" url="?curid=858161" title="Asiago">
<text>Asiago (; Venetian: &quot;Axiago&quot;, Cimbrian: &quot;Slege&quot;, German: &quot;Schlägen&quot; ) is a minor township (population roughly 6,500) with the title of city in the surrounding plateau region (the &quot;Altopiano di Asiago&quot; or &quot;Altopiano dei Sette Comuni&quot;, Asiago plateau) in the Province of Vicenza in the Veneto region of Northeastern Italy. It is near the border between the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol regions in the foothills of the Alps, approximately equidistant (60 km) from Trento to the west and Vicenza to the south. The Asiago region is the origin of Asiago cheese. The town was the site of a major battle between Austrian and Italian forces on the Alpine Front of World War I. It is a major ski resort destination, and the site of the Astrophysical Observatory of Asiago, operated by the University of Padua.

==Culture==
Until the middle of the nineteenth century many of the people of Asiago spoke Cimbrian, a German dialect.

Asiago is the birthplace of Italian writer Mario Rigoni Stern, and features prominently in his stories. It is also described in Emilio Lussu&#x27;s &quot;One Year on the High Plateau,&quot; Lussu was an officer in the Sassari Brigade, and in his book the author describes the horror and violence of the war.

==Battle of Asiago==
The Battle of Asiago (Battle of the Plateaux) was a counter-offensive launched by the Austro-Hungarians on the Italian Front in May 1916, during World War I. It was an unexpected attack that occurred near Asiago (now in northeast Italy, then on the Italian side of the border between the Kingdom of Italy and Austria-Hungary). Commemorating this battle and the fallen soldiers of World War I is the Asiago War Memorial, a monument and museum that is a popular site for visitors to the area.

In a later engagement in 1918, Edward Brittain, brother of Vera Brittain, was killed and was buried in the Granezza British military cemetery on the plateau. In 1970 Vera&#x27;s ashes were scattered on his grave.

The Barenthal, Boscon, Granezza, Magnaboschi and Cavalletto Military Cemeteries at Asiago were designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1920.

==Sport==

<doc id="858164" wikidata="Q1138622" url="?curid=858164" title="Seneschal">
<text>The word seneschal () can have several different meanings, all of which reflect certain types of supervising or administering in a historic context. Most commonly, a seneschal was a senior position filled by a court appointment within a royal, ducal, or noble household during the Middle Ages and early Modern period – historically a steward or majordomo of a medieval great house. In a medieval royal household, a seneschal was in charge of domestic arrangements and the administration of servants, which, in the medieval period particularly, meant the seneschal might oversee hundreds of laborers, servants and their associated responsibilities, and have a great deal of power in the community, at a time when much of the local economy was often based on the wealth and responsibilities of such a household.

A second meaning is more specific, and concerns the late medieval and early modern nation of France, wherein the seneschal () was also a royal officer in charge of justice and control of the administration of certain southern provinces called seneschalties, holding a role equivalent to a northern French bailiff (&quot;&quot;).

In the United Kingdom the modern meaning of seneschal is primarily as an ecclesiastical term, referring to a cathedral official.

==Origin==
The Medieval Latin &quot;discifer&quot; (dish-bearer) was an officer in the household of later Anglo-Saxon kings, and it is sometimes translated by historians as seneschal, although the term was not used in England before the Norman Conquest.

The term, first attested in 1350–1400, was borrowed from Anglo-Norman &quot;seneschal&quot; &quot;steward&quot;, from Old Dutch &quot;senior retainer&quot; (attested in Latin (692 AD), Old High German ), a compound of - (cf. Gothic &quot;old&quot;, &quot;oldest&quot;) and &quot;servant&quot;, ultimately a calque of Late Latin &quot;senior guard&quot;.

The &quot;scholae&quot; in the late Roman Empire referred to the imperial guard, divided into senior (&quot;seniores&quot;) and junior (&quot;juniores&quot;) units. The captain of the guard was known as &quot;comes scholarum&quot;. When Germanic tribes took over the Empire, the &quot;scholae&quot; were merged or replaced with the Germanic king&#x27;s warband (cf. Vulgar Latin , OHG , Old English ) whose members also had duties in their lord&#x27;s household like a royal retinue. The king&#x27;s chief warbandman and retainer (cf. Old Saxon , OHG , OE , ), from the 5th century on, personally attended on the king, as specifically stated in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot; of 413 (&quot;Cod. Theod.&quot; VI. 13. 1; known as &quot;comes scholae&quot;). The warband, once sedentary, became first the king&#x27;s royal household, and then his great officers of state, and in both cases the seneschal is synonymous with steward.

==Medieval Europe==
===France===
In late medieval and early modern France, the seneschal was originally a royal steward overseeing the entire country but developed into an agent of the crown charged with administration of a seneschalty (), one of the districts of the crown lands in Gascony, Aquitaine, Languedoc and Normandy. Hallam states that the first seneschals to govern in this manner did so by an 1190 edict of Philip II. The seneschals also served as the chief justice of the royal courts of appeal in their areas and were occasionally seconded by vice-seneschals.

The equivalent post throughout most of northern France was the bailiff (&#x27;), who oversaw a bailiwick (&#x27;).

* William de Gometz was Seneschal of France .
* Osbern the Steward was seneschal to two dukes of Normandy.

Under rulers of England
* Bertram de Criol, then member of the King&#x27;s Council, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover Castle, and Keeper of the Archbishopric of Canterbury, and shortly to become Constable of the Tower of London, is referred to as &quot;our Seneschal&quot; in Letters of King Henry III of December 1239.
* Sir William Felton, an English knight, was appointed seneschal of Poitou in 1360.
* Sir Thomas Felton, an English knight, was appointed seneschal of Aquitaine in 1362 and seneschal of Bordeaux in 1372.
* Sir John Chandos, an English knight, was appointed seneschal of Poitou in 1369.

===Anglo-Saxon England===

In Anglo-Saxon England dish-bearers (in Medieval Latin &quot;discifer&quot; or &quot;dapifer&quot;) were nobles who served at royal feasts. The term is often translated by historians as &quot;seneschal&quot;.

===Gwynedd===
The title of Seneschal was used in the Kingdom of Gwynedd during the medieval ages. Documented in the 12th century were the Stewards (Seneschal) of King Owain Gwynedd, those being Hwfa ap Cynddelw and Llywarch ap Bran, both of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales. Then merely a century later, the role was occupied by Ednyfed Fychan (c. 1200s), and later on his sons Sir Tudur ap Ednyfed Fychan and Goronwy ab Ednyfed became Seneschals to the Kings of Gwynedd. Fychan&#x27;s family became known as the Tudors of Penmynydd.

=== Isle of Man ===
The Seneschal of Tynwald is an administrative role to the Parliament of the Isle of Man, part of the staff of the Clerk of Tynwald’s Office. The Seneschal role was formed in 2006 and is part of the Tynwald Corporate Services Office. The Seneschal manages the Messengers and Gardyn Coadee. 

=== Sark ===

The Seneschal of Sark presides over the Court of the Seneschal, which hears civil and some criminal cases.

===Papacy===
Formerly, officers known as Seneschal Dapifers were involved in the ceremony of the papal conclave during the election of a new Pope, to see to mealtimes for the cardinal electors while ensuring secrecy. Cardinals regularly had meals sent in from their homes with much pageantry accompanying the conveyance of food: 

These ceremonies have not been observed since the nineteenth century.

In the Knights Templar, seneschal was the title used by the second-in-command of the Order after the Grand Master.

<text>The Astatic was a French cyclecar manufactured from 1920 to 1922 by Automobiles Astatic, Saint-Ouen, Seine, France.

Built at Saint-Ouen, the car was an attempt to market a vehicle with independent suspension all round. This was done by coupling each wheel to a horizontal coil spring by a right angle link. At the rear the differential housing was fixed to the chassis and drive was taken to the wheels through jointed drive shafts. The engine was an 894 cc or 1100 cc S.C.A.P.

<text>King Street Station is a train station in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cascades&quot;, &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, and &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, as well as Sounder commuter trains run by Sound Transit. The station also anchors a major transit hub, which includes Link light rail at International District/Chinatown station and Seattle Streetcar service. It is located at the south end of Downtown Seattle in the Pioneer Square neighborhood, near the intersection of South Jackson Street and 4th Avenue South, and has four major entrances. It is the 15th-busiest station on the Amtrak system, serving as the hub for the Pacific Northwest region.

Opened on May 10, 1906, it served as a union station for the Great Northern Railway and the Northern Pacific Railway, both owned by James J. Hill. The station was designed by Reed and Stem and incorporated elements from various architectural styles, including a prominent clocktower inspired by St. Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice. A second city terminal, Union Station, was built one block to the east and opened in 1911. As passenger train service declined in the mid-20th century, King Street Station fell into disrepair and was renovated several times to conceal interior elements in the name of modernization. It was selected as Amtrak&#x27;s sole Seattle station in 1971 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places two years later. Commuter rail service began in 2000 from a new platform and pedestrian bridge at South Weller Street. King Street Station was acquired by Seattle&#x27;s city government in 2008 and renovated in 2013 at a cost of $55 million, restoring its original fixtures.

The current station consists of ten tracks and four platforms, including one that is used by Sounder commuter trains and connected via a pedestrian bridge on South Weller Street. The remaining platforms, accessed from the station&#x27;s waiting room, are used for Amtrak services and special event trains.

==History==
Built between 1904 and 1906 by the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, the station replaced an antiquated station on Railroad Avenue, today&#x27;s Alaskan Way. Designed by the firm of Reed and Stem of St. Paul, Minnesota, who acted as associate architects for the design of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, the station was part of a larger project that moved the mainline away from the waterfront and into the planned Great Northern Tunnel under downtown. The depot&#x27;s tower was modeled after the recently collapsed Campanile di San Marco in Venice, Italy, making it the tallest building in Seattle at the time of its construction. This tower contained four huge mechanical clock faces built by E. Howard &amp; Co. of Boston, Massachusetts, offering the time to each of the four cardinal directions. At the time of installation it was said to be the second largest timepiece on the Pacific Coast, second only to the Ferry Building in San Francisco, California. Later, this tower also served as a microwave tower for the Burlington Northern Railroad, the successor of both the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railways, whose offices occupied the second and third floors of the station. King Street Station was Seattle&#x27;s primary train terminal until the construction of the adjacent Oregon &amp; Washington Depot, later named Union Station, in 1911; the &quot;1912 Baist&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Real Estate Atlas of&quot; &quot;Seattle&quot; still refers to King Street Station as &quot;Union Passenger Depot&quot;.

After the end of World War II, as passenger rail travel began to decline across the United States, steps were taken to gradually modernize King Street Station. The ticket counters, once located directly to the east of the compass room, were expanded outward into the waiting room. In the late 1940s a set of &quot;electric stairs&quot; and a new side entrance to the second floor railroad offices were built over the open stairwell to Jackson Street, narrowing them by half. Over the next two decades, as train ridership and the station&#x27;s number of employees dwindled, the station was further remodeled to reduce maintenance and heating costs. In the late 1950s the station&#x27;s original high-back benches, made of yellow oak, were replaced by modern chrome and plastic seats. The final blow to the station&#x27;s character occurred in late 1967 when, under the direction of Northern Pacific architect A.C. Cayou, a new drop ceiling of plastic and metal was installed in the waiting room ten feet below the original, concealing the hand-carved coffered ceiling to just below the balcony and second level arcade. Hundreds of holes had to be punched through the plaster to attach the ceiling&#x27;s support wires to the steel frame of the building. The new ceiling held new fluorescent lights and heat lamps, replacing the original brass chandeliers and sconces. Below the new ceiling, plaster reliefs, marble panels, glass tile mosaics and other original fixtures were sheared from the walls and replaced with sheet rock and Formica paneling. The dedicated women&#x27;s waiting room at the southwest corner of the building was converted into employee offices; its own architectural details suffering the same damage. The only original remaining features left visible in the main waiting area were the terrazzo tile floor and the clock on the west wall above the restrooms.

Despite the attempted modernization, the station continued to deteriorate. Following the creation of Amtrak in 1971 to take over the money-losing passenger service from the railroad companies, hundreds of routes were eliminated and service across the country was cut in half. Amtrak consolidated all of its Seattle service at King Street Station, resulting in the closure of Union Station, which formerly served Union Pacific (the Milwaukee Road had moved out a decade earlier). To further cut costs the station&#x27;s restaurant, lunch counter, and gift shop were immediately closed and vending machines installed. Eventually even the escalators stopped running and without the funds or passenger volume to justify repairing them, were permanently walled off.

Today, the station has been fully restored and is part of a group of transportation facilities in the southern portion of Downtown Seattle. King Street Station is located a block away from the International District/Chinatown station of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel serving the Link Light Rail 1 Line. Many King County Metro and Sound Transit Express bus routes serve the area, and the &quot;First Hill&quot; line of the Seattle Streetcar network stops nearby. After many years, the original upper entrance off of Jackson Street has been reopened. The station entrance located on the first floor off King Street now also has a passenger drop-off loop for vehicles, instead of a small parking lot.

===Restoration===
Plans to restore the entire building to its former prominence, including cosmetic renovations to both the station interior and exterior, began in 2003. As part of these renovations the Compass Room and restrooms were refurbished, and the exterior awnings were replaced. New mahogany entry doors and wood framed windows were installed in the waiting room and Compass Room. New brass door hardware and reproduction period light fixtures and plaster decorative work were included to reproduce the former character of the station&#x27;s interior.

In November 2006, the Office of Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a preliminary agreement between the City of Seattle and BNSF Railway to purchase the station for $1. The Seattle City Council formalized the agreement by passing legislation in December 2006. The deal, revised to $10, was signed March 5, 2008. The purchase by the city freed up US$19 million of state and federal funds that was used for further restoration of the station. The city earmarked a further US$10 million for the restoration as part of a passed local transportation levy.

In 2008, the clocks in the clock tower were repaired, and the old radio microwave antennas were removed. Repair work to the exterior continued as of June 2010.
Phase two of the project began in May 2010, when demolition work commenced on the second and third floors, previously used by Burlington Northern for division offices. Work on modernizing the baggage area, originally used as a restaurant, were also undertaken during this time. During June 2010, work also began on demolition of a 1950s addition to the building that housed the escalators and part of the Jackson Street Plaza. Demolition work was completed by September 2010. A surprise development during this phase was the removal of the suspended ceilings in early July. Crews worked over several nights while the station was mostly empty removing the over 1,600 acoustic tiles and their framing. The modern light fixtures and remaining suspended wires remained until enough funding became available to complete restoration. The final phase of the project focused on the rebuilding of the Jackson Plaza. Thirty-six geothermic wells reaching into the ground were drilled to eventually heat and cool the station. A new concrete floor was poured including seismic wall supports and space for an elevator and new ticketing and baggage areas.

In October 2010, the King Street Station project was awarded $18.2 million from $2.4 billion in high-speed intercity passenger rail service funding announced by the U.S. Transportation Department. This funding was needed by the project in order to complete seismic regrades and to finalize the restoration of the interior. The restoration project was completed and the station was officially rededicated on April 24, 2013.
==Architecture==
King Street Station is a red brick masonry and steel frame building with terra cotta and cast stone ornamentation, through relatively subdued in comparison to the clock tower. The architectural style is sometimes denoted as &quot;Railroad Italianate&quot; with definite Italian inspirations on the interior and in the clock tower while the base shows influences of Beaux Arts.

The entire first floor exterior is brick-clad with granite. The building is L-shaped with the clock tower marking the main entry on the west facade. The clock tower and main entry terminate the axis of King Street in Pioneer Square. 

The main building&#x27;s roof features Ludowici clay tile with a green glaze. The clock tower&#x27;s roof is unique; it&#x27;s covered with glass Ludowici tile that is backlit at night to showcase its transparency. The glass tiles were made with manganese, causing them to turn purple over time from UV exposure. During the 2013 restoration these tiles were replaced with salvaged glass tiles of the same age made by the same manufacturer.

Inside the main entry, at the base of the clock tower, is the entry hall, known as the Compass Room. The name references the navigational star compass rose design laid out in hand-cut marble tiles on the floor at its center. The Compass Room has marble wainscotting, and is lighted by a multi-globe chandelier suspended above the compass rose from an elaborate plaster rosette. Triple-globe wall sconces around the perimeter illuminate a band of inlaid green iridescent glass tile on the walls. Circular clerestory windows are trimmed in plaster relief decoration. This motif was originally repeated throughout most of the station&#x27;s waiting room. While there is no known influence for the design of the interior, it resembles the ceiling of the famous Salone dei Cinquecento at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy featuring a similar coffered grid with dentils and repeating circles, while the terrazzo floor features Greek-influenced meander patterns.

<text>Walter H. Halloran (September 21, 1921 – March 1, 2005) was a Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus who, at the age of twenty-six, assisted in the exorcism of Roland Doe in Washington, D.C. and St. Louis, Missouri. The anonymous Doe, a thirteen-year-old Lutheran boy from Cottage City, Maryland, was allegedly possessed. The case inspired William Peter Blatty to write his novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

==Life==
Halloran was born in Jackson, Minnesota, in 1921. He was the oldest of nine children. He became a student at the Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1934. He was a member of the school&#x27;s football team. In 1941, he became a member of the Society of Jesus. Halloran attended St. Louis University and in 1954 was ordained a priest, and two years later began teaching theology and history at his old school the Campion Jesuit High boarding school in Prairie du Chien, while also coaching football. In 1963 he moved to Marquette University, where he taught history until 1966 when he volunteered for chaplain duty with the United States Army. He first served in Germany but in 1969, at the age of 48, he volunteered for paratrooper training and then for duty in Vietnam where he would say he saw more evil than in the boy&#x27;s hospital bed back in 1949. According to his brother John Halloran, he really wanted to work with the men. Halloran would helicopter in to the fighting zones, sometimes staying for days on end ministering to the soldiers. By the end of his service as a paratrooper chaplain in 1971, he had earned two Bronze Stars. After his service was over, he went back to St. Louis in 1972 to teach at St. Louis University High and to serve as assistant director of campus ministry and then alumni director. Halloran would have a variety of assignments from then on, such as being an associate pastor in his hometown of Jackson, Minnesota, and running a parish ministry in San Diego, California. In 1988, Halloran was an assistant director of the alumni office at Creighton University in Omaha.

== Exorcism ==

According to author Thomas B. Allen, Halloran &quot;expressed his skepticism about potential paranormal events before his death.&quot; When asked in an interview to make a statement on whether the boy had been possessed, Halloran responded saying &quot;No, I can’t go on record, I never made an absolute statement about the things because I didn’t feel I was qualified.&quot;

==Death==
In 2003, Halloran was diagnosed with cancer and retired to the St. Camillus Jesuit Community in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where he died on March 1, 2005. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving Jesuit who had assisted in the 1949 case.

<doc id="858170" wikidata="Q17126748" url="?curid=858170" title="Mincing">
<text>Mincing is a food preparation technique in which food ingredients are finely divided into uniform pieces. Minced food is in smaller pieces than diced or chopped foods, and is often prepared with a chef&#x27;s knife or food processor, or in the case of meat by a specialised meat grinder.

For a true mince, the effect is to create a closely bonded mixture of ingredients and a soft or pasty texture. However, in many recipes, the intention is for firmer foods such as onions and other root vegetables to remain in individual chunks when minced.

Flavoring ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and fresh herbs may be minced in this way to distribute flavor more evenly in a mixture. Additionally, bruising of the tissue can release juices and oils to deliver flavors uniformly in a sauce. Mincemeat tarts/mince pies and pâtés employ mincing in the preparation of mouldable paste. Meat is also minced, and this cooking technique is used in Greek cuisine.

<text>L&#x27;Aster, Aster, Ateliers de Construction Mecanique l&#x27;Aster, was a French manufacturer of automobiles and the leading supplier of engines to other manufacturers from the late 1890s until circa 1910/12. Although primarily known as an engine mass manufacturer the company also produced chassis for coach-works and a complete range of components.

Aster produced a range of engines including: stationary motors; electricity generators; automobile motors; marine engines and aero engines. There were air-cooled and water cooled Gasoline motors, Kerosene motors, and Gas Motors.
Among the companies for which Aster produced engines and other parts were Ache Frères, Achilles, Argyll, Ariès, Aster-Newey, Automobiles Barré, Bolide, Belhaven, Bij &#x27;t Vuur, Century, Clément, Darracq, Dennis, Durham-Churchill, Ernst, Excelsior, Gladiator, Hanzer, Hoflack, Hurtu, Korn et Latil, Lacoste &amp; Battmann, La Torpille, Lucerna, Newey Aster, Société Parisienne, Passy-Thellier, Pearson, Prunel, Rochet, Rouxel, Reyrol, Sage, Siddeley-Deasy, Simplicia, Singer, Swift, Vulcan, 
West-Aster, Whippet, Whitlock. and Le Zèbre. By 1906 Aster was able to claim over 11,000 users of their engines.

From the mid-1900s &#x27;Aster-Wembley&#x27; manufactured engines under license in Wembley (London) UK. In 1913 this became the &#x27;Aster Engineering Co&#x27; which produced aircraft engines during the First World War, and then in 1922 started production of Aster cars. By 1927 it had been absorbed into Arrol Johnston. In Italy, the Aster Società Italiana Motori supplied and built both cars and engines under licence from 1906-1908.

In 1904 the Parisian newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; stated that &quot;Aster monopolised the mass manufacture of engines in France, and had a &#x27;universal reputation&#x27; and success shown by innumerable users.&quot; By 1912 they claimed to cater for over 130 makes.

==History==

Aster was a French manufacturer of automobiles and the leading supplier of engines to other manufacturers from 1900 to 1910. Although primarily known as an engine mass manufacturer the company also produced chassis for coachworks.

In 1878 the Aster company was established at 102 rue de Paris, Saint-Denis. Engine id plates stated &quot;&#x27;Ateliers de Construction Mécanique l&#x27;Aster. 74, Rue de la Victoire, Paris&quot; (the registered office), &quot;Usines à St Denis (Seine)&quot; (The factory).

At the 1900 &#x27;Salon de l&#x27;Auto&#x27; in Paris Aster exhibited a motor quadricycle equipped with their own 3.5 HP, single cylinder engine. The expanding range included : stationary motors; electricity generator; automobile motors and marine launch motors. There were air-cooled and water cooled Gasoline motors, Kerosene motors, and Gas Motors.

A 12 h.p. Aster was exhibited at the 1903 Crystal Palace Motor Show and a range of Aster cars was sold in Britain between 1905 and 1907.

In Italy the Aster Società Italiana Motori supplied cars and engines from 1906-1908 under licence.

Aster had manufacturing capabilities in Wembley, North London, UK which both traded and stamped the engines as &quot;Aster-Wembley&quot;. Begbie Manufacturing of Wembley was founded in 1899 by Sydney D Begbie (A.M.I.M.E.) and in the mid-1900s became British licensees of Aster, making mainly stationary engines. In 1913 they became Aster Engineering Co (1913) Ltd and during the First World War made aircraft engines. In 1922 they began producing Aster automobiles. From 1927 they were absorbed into Arrol Johnston &amp; Aster Eng, Dumfries Scotland GB. The last Aster engines were made in 1930 by Meadows.
Sydney D Begbie (A.M.I.M.E.) worked as the &#x27;Resident Engineer&#x27; of Aster, St. Denis, in Paris during the 1900s. He was an early cyclist, world record holder, and pioneer in the motor engineering business. He was Managing Director of the Begbie Manufacturing Co., Ltd of Wembley, which became the British licensee of Aster. Begbie also worked as Consulting Engineer to Henry Whitlock, Ltd. and The West London Motor Co. Ltd, both of whom were users of Aster engines.

==Automobiles==
At the 1900 &#x27;Salon de l&#x27;Auto&#x27; in Paris Aster exhibited a motor quadricycle equipped with their own 3.5 HP, single cylinder engine. Engine sizes and multi-cylinder engines were progressively developed.

A 12 h.p. Aster was exhibited at the 1903 Crystal Palace Motor Show and a range of Aster cars was sold in Britain between 1905 and 1907.

In 1904 Aster produced a 16/20 h.p. four-cylinder, five seat automobile with rear-entrance and Tonneau, with a Type 43 JS engine.

In Italy, the Aster Società Italiana Motori supplied cars and engines from 1906-1908 under licence.

The &#x27;Ateliers de Construction Mecanique l&#x27;Aster&#x27; from St. Denis (Seine) exhibited a four-cylinder chassis at the 1907 Paris Salon.

==Engines==



Aster produced a range of engines including: stationary motors; electricity generators; automobile motors, heavy duty motors, marine launch motors and aero engines. There were air-cooled and water cooled options plus Gasoline motors, Kerosene motors, and Gas Motors.

:&quot;This list is provisional and may contain overlapping data. You can help to rationalise it with fully sourced information&quot;

Note : The Type letters are an Aster code: I = 80mm cylinder bore, J = 84mm cylinder bore, K = 88mm cylinder bore, L = 95mm cylinder bore, N = 105mm cylinder bore, S = separate cylinders,

==Components==
Aster was a major supplier of automobile components to both vehicle manufacturers and end users. As shown in its advertising and exhibition stands, both the French parent and the English associate were suppliers of : engines, gear boxes, gears, chassis, steering gear, radiators, spark plugs, magnetos, coils, accumulators, Oleo plugs, C.M.F. and lubricators.

==Partners==
On 11 July 1904 the Parisian newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; stated that the mass manufacture of engines was monopolised in France by Aster, the only brand specialising in manufacturing engines, and which had a &#x27;universal reputation&#x27; and success shown by innumerable users.

In 1912 the French and English Aster factories claimed that they catered for over 130 vehicle makes.

===Achilles===
A range of Achilles cars were advertised, mostly with single-cylinder engines by Aster and De Dion. At least 5 different models were produced including the 8 h.p., 9 h.p. and 12 h.p.

===Century===

&#x27;Century Engineering and Motor Co&#x27; of Willesden Junction, London produced motorcycles from 1902 to 1905.
In 1904 their Tandem forecar model was equipped with either a 5 h.p. Aster engine, (or 6.5 h.p. with &#x27;Begbie Audin&#x27; water cooled radiator) driving a countershaft by chain. The rear axle was driven by one of two chains, to give high and low speeds. A tradesman&#x27;s carrier model was also listed.

===Darracq===
In 1896 Alexandre Darracq founded the &#x27;Societe Alexandre Darracq Suresnes&#x27; to build motorised cycles. The first models were &quot;Perfecta&quot; tricycles and quadricycles, made under licence from Léon Bollée and equipped with Aster engines.

===Durham-Churchill (Hallamshire)===

Durham-Churchill of Grimesthorpe near Sheffield manufactured charabancs as &#x27;Hallamshire Cars&#x27; from 1903 until 1917. 
In 1905, they displayed a 24-seater charabanc powered by a four-cylinder 24 h.p. Aster engine. It drove the rear axle via a Champion clutch and four-speed gearbox. It was launched at the Royal Agricultural Hall Show at a cost of £600. In 1906 they also used Aster engines in their range of cars: the two-cylinder 10–12 h.p. and four-cylinder 12–14 h.p.; 20 h.p.; and 24 h.p. models. By 1908, their 26-seater charabanc was powered by a 30 h.p. Aster engine.

===Excelsior===
From January 1904, the Belgian Manufacturer Excelsior (&quot;The Belgian Bentley&quot;) built a few cars equipped with a reinforced wooden frame and fitted with Aster engines, single, twin and four cylinders. The first models were powered by a two- or four-cylinder Aster engine; this was considered nothing special however.

===Gladiator===
The Gladiator Cycle Company, Clément-Gladiator (from 1896), was a French manufacturer of bicycles, motorcycles and cars based in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, Seine. In 1899 they launched a motor car with a front-mounted Aster engine, steering wheel, two-speed transmission by foot pedals and final drive by chain. By 1902 Gladiator manufactured its own four-cylinder engines.

===Horley Motor &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd===
The Horley Motor &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd, used Aster engines in their vans from 1908-1909.

===Korn et Latil===
The Korn et Latil was a French automobile manufactured from 1901 until 1902. It was a voiturette with a 3½ h.p. Aster engine.

===Lewis===

Vivian Lewis began the &#x27;Ormonde Bicycle Depot&#x27; on Freeman Street, Adelaide in 1893. In November 1900, the Lewis Cycle and Motor Works on McHenry Street, Adelaide produced the first Lewis car. By the mid-1900s they produced the &#x27;Lewis-Aster&#x27; but the quantity is currently unknown.

===Newey-Aster===
Gordon Newey manufactured three models of motorcar with Aster engines: 10/12 HP, 20/22 HP and 24/30 HP, plus trucks which could carry a 500 kg payload.

===Orient Aster===
In 1898 or 1899 Charles Metz of the Metz Company of Waltham, Massachusetts built the first US produced motorcycle. It used an Aster engine which was a copy of De Dion-Bouton&#x27;s small, light, high reviving four-stroke single with battery and coil ignition.

===Parsons Biplane===
The Parsons biplane was built in May 1913 by J.G. Parsons and Percy Maxwell Muller as an engineering test-bed for the Parsons Pendulum Paddle-Wheel Stabilizer. The first model was initially fitted with an Aster 40 h.p. four-cylinder, inline, water-cooled, engine driving an 8 ft 2in diameter Normale propeller, but it was replaced by a Gnome engine by July 1913.

===Pearson===
The Pearson (motorcycle) was a British motorcycle manufactured by the Pearson brothers of Southsea, Hampshire, in 1904. It was equipped with a 4 h.p. Aster engine mounted in a &#x27;loop and diamond&#x27; frame.

===Phébus-Aster===
Noe Boyer &amp; Cie, from Suresnes, Paris, named their 1899-1903 Automobilette after Phoebus, the Greek god who drove the sun across the heavens each day. It was powered by a 3.5 hp Aster engine. Charles Jarrott, partnered by F.F. Wellington, achieved 38 mph at the Crystal Palace velodrome, establishing Aster-engined Phebus tricycles as fast and powerful. Wellington was the English importer of Phebus tricycles and voiturettes. The two-speed voiturette was powered by a rear-mounted single-cylinder 397cc Aster engine.

===Rouxel===
The Rouxel was a French automobile manufactured from 1899 until 1900. The company produced two models, including a two-speed voiturette with 2½ h.p. Aster engine.

===Siddeley-Deasy===

Siddeley-Deasy used Rover chassis and Daimler and Aster engines.

===Simplicia===
The Simplicia was a French automobile manufactured only in 1910. It used a 10/12 h.p. Aster engine.

===Singer===
Singer made their first four-wheel car in 1905. The first Singer-designed car was fitted with an Aster 4-cylinder 2.4 litre 12/14 in 1906. For 1907 a range of two-, three- and four-cylinder models using White and Poppe engines launched. The Aster engined models were dropped in 1909.

===West Aster===
Enoch John West started building cars in Coventry, England under the name of &#x27;The Progress Cycle co&#x27; in 1900. but in 1903 it went bankrupt so he founded West and West-Aster which produced cars from 1904 with Aster engines, but by 1908 (or 1910) the company had failed.

The guide to the 1906 Olympia Motor Show described the West-Aster thus :
:A car which attracted our attention by reason of its up-to-date construction and reasonable price was the &quot;West&quot; made by West, Ltd, of South Molton Street, Bond Street, London, W. It is fitted with the celebrated Aster engine, which carries the Aster Company&#x27;s guarantee. It is otherwise made in Coventry, and good, sound construction is put into every part.

===Whippet Motor and Cycle Co===
The Whippet Motor and Cycle Co produced Whippet motorcycles from 1903 to 1905. Two machines were exhibited at the late-1903 Crystal Palace show, of which the forecar was fitted with a 3.25 h.p. Aster engine. It also had two-speed gearing using two chain wheels of different diameters, fitted to the rear hub and a device to shift the drive chain from one to the other, just as on a bicycle.

===Whitlock===

The Whitlock company, based in Holland Park London, moved into the car industry in 1903 when they rebadged a &#x27;Century&#x27; car manufactured in Willesden, London as a &#x27;Whitlock Century&#x27;. (See &#x27;Century&#x27; above).

In 1905 &#x27;The Whitlock Automobile Company&#x27; was formed to market Whitlock-Aster cars. They produced a 10-12 h.p.; a 12 h.p.; a 12-14 h.p. twin cylinder with shaft drive; an 18 h.p. and a 24 h.p. model, which were listed as of French manufacture. The cars reportedly were well received but cannot have been a commercial success as the company closed down in 1906.

===Vulcan===
Vulcan was an English manufacturer of cars from 1902 until 1928. The company built a range of engines for the early models, but in 1912 their new small car, the 10/12, was equipped with a 1.8 L two-cylinder Aster engine, the first use of a bought in engine.

==Conflicts and threats==
The National Highways NH-181 and NH-766 pass through Bandipur national park. This road has been a major concern as speeding vehicles have killed many wild animals in spite of frequent warnings to travelers from the forest department officials and restriction on movement of vehicles in some stretches between 9 P.M to 6 A.M. This has raised fears of extinction of habitat of wild animals exclusively found in this national park.

On 9 October 2018 the National Park lost one of its prized possession, a tusker named &#x27;Rowdy Ranga&#x27; was hit by a bus in the night after which the government of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka agreed to ban night traffic in the forest. However, Kerala condemns the &#x27;Night Ban&#x27; and has asked for the ban to be lifted to save a reroute that increases the distance by 45 km.

<doc id="858178" wikidata="Q6540900" url="?curid=858178" title="Liberalism in Europe">
<text>Liberalism in Europe is a political movement that supports a broad tradition of individual liberties and constitutionally-limited and democratically accountable government. These European derivatives of classical liberalism are found in centrist movements and parties, as well as some parties on the centre-left and the centre-right.

Most liberalism in Europe is conservative or classical whilst European social liberalism and progressivism is rooted in classical radicalism, a left-wing classical liberal idea. Liberalism in Europe is broadly divided into two groups: &quot;social&quot; (or &quot;left-&quot;) and &quot;conservative&quot; (or &quot;right-&quot;). This differs from the USA&#x27;s method of dividing liberalism into &quot;modern&quot; (simply &quot;liberal&quot;) and &quot;classical&quot; (or &quot;libertarian&quot;, albeit there is some disagreement), although the two groups are very similar to their European counterparts.

== Liberal practices ==
Liberal political parties have specific policies, which the social scientist can either read from party manifestos, or infer from actual actions and laws passed by ostensibly liberal parties. The sources listed below serve to illustrate some of the current liberal attitudes in Europe:
* the policies of liberal parties in government, including those in coalition arrangements (taking into mind that coalition partners make compromises), since they show what liberals are prepared to accept, as well as the policies of liberal parties in opposition;
* the positions of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe faction in the European Parliament, as well as the Electoral Manifestos of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party;
* the forum of Germany&#x27;s Free Democratic Party, which is relatively unmoderated, and illustrates grassroots liberal concerns. Sites of other Liberal parties, such as Britain&#x27;s Liberal Democrats, ot the Netherlands&#x27; Democrats 66, are more heavily moderated and therefore more representative for the policy of liberal parties;
* the Belgian website/think tank Liberales.be, which has longer essays on new liberal policies;
* the views and policies of the Open Society Institute, since they explicitly claim to derive from the principles of the major liberal philosopher Karl Popper;
* the Lisbon Strategy of the European Union, since it is strongly supported by the liberal parties, and sets out a vision of a future Europe.

Additionally, liberal value preferences can be inferred from the liberalisation programmes and policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The liberalism visible in these sources emphasizes in comparison with other ideologies more belief in individual development as a motor for society and the state providing a social safety net. The liberal policies differ from country to country and from party to party.

== Ideology ==
European liberalism is largely divided into classical (in practical terms, liberalism as it is applied to the economy), social, and conservative. Liberalism in the European context is distinct from liberalism in the United States. In the United States, people who are called &quot;liberals&quot; generally advocate for a larger government, some forms of protectionism, and more economic interventionism, and are sometimes also called social democrats, or even leftists. In contrast, European liberals usually favor limited government, free trade, and adhere to economic liberalism.

In the context of European politics, a &quot;liberal&quot; (when the word is used without a modifier) is generally understood to refer to a classical liberal, who may be either centre-left or centre-right. As a result, a European &quot;classical liberal&quot; usually refers to a centre-right person with prominent economically liberal tendencies; Germany&#x27;s Free Democratic Party, for example, follows classical liberalism in this sense. Under one interpretation, a European mainstream &quot;conservative liberal&quot; (a proponent of ordoliberalism or Christian democracy) usually has weaker economically liberal tendencies than a &quot;social liberal&quot;; however, some consider &quot;classical liberal&quot;s (economic liberals) to also be &quot;conservative liberal&quot;s.

=== European Union ===
European liberalists tend to support the European Union. One example is Emmanuel Macron, the incumbent president of France, who campaigned against Marine Le Pen, a candidate from the far-right, nationalist, and Eurosceptic party known as the National Rally. Some prominent European liberalists, such as Guy Verhofstadt (former Prime Minister of Belgium), Viviane Reading (current Vice-President of the European Commission), and Matteo Renzi (former Prime Minister of Italy), are proponents of a future federalisation of the European Union. 

=== Social issues ===
Among European liberals, &quot;classical liberals&quot; and &quot;social liberals&quot; support cultural liberalism, for example LGBT rights issues including same-sex marriage, legalization of some drugs, opening immigration, etc., while most &quot;conservative liberals&quot;, including ordoliberals, Christian democrats, and some agrarians, take a moderate-to-conservative stance on cultural issues. For example, Finland&#x27;s Centre Party, a Nordic agrarian party, follows conservative liberalism in this sense.

<text>: &quot;For the French Aster automobile manufacturer of 1900-1910, see Ateliers de Construction Mecanique l&#x27;Aster&quot;
The Aster was an English automobile manufactured from 1922 to 1930. The company&#x27;s car roots can be traced to 1899 when Begbie Manufacturing of Wembley, in north London became British licensees of the French Aster company (Ateliers de Construction Mecanique l&#x27;Aster) making mainly stationary engines. In 1913 they became Aster Engineering Co (1913) Ltd and during World War I made aircraft engines.

==Models==
===18/50, 20/55, 21/60===
The first Aster cars were made in 1922 with the luxurious 18/50, which had a 2618 cc six cylinder overhead valve engine driving the rear wheels through a four speed gearbox. The 126 inch wheelbase chassis had semi elliptic springing at the front and cantilevered springs at the rear with four wheel brakes as an early option. The car was listed at £850 in 1923 and about 50 were made before in 1924 the engine was enlarged to 2890 cc by increasing its bore from 69.5 to 73 mm in the 20/55 model. One was bought by the Duke of York. About another 50 of the larger cars were made. In 1926 the engine was further bored out to 75 mm, the stroke stayed at 115 mm throughout, making the 3042 cc 21/60.

===24/70===
The largest car they made was the 1927 24/70 with a 147-inch wheelbase, a foot longer than the 21/60. The 3042 cc engine for this was created by boring the engine a further 5 mm to 80 mm and fitting Burt-McCollum single sleeve valves which were also fitted to the 21/60 engine from that year. The top of the range 39 cwt Landaulette cost £1300. Probably about 70 were made.

==Merger==
They merged with Arrol-Johnston in 1927 following which production moved to Dumfries, Scotland and the cars became known as Arrol-Asters. The Wembley premises were kept as a service depot eventually being sold to Singer. The 21/60 and 24/70 were kept in production and were joined by a straight eight 3150 cc sleeve valved engine 23/70 and 17/50 six which was also available with Cozette supercharger.

==Receivership==
The late 1920s were not a good time for luxury car makers and the receivers arrived in 1929. Limited production continued until 1931 when the factory finally closed.

==French Aster==

The French Aster car company based in Saint-Denis Paris operated between 1900 and circa 1912. They produced their own cars plus engines and gearboxes for other manufacturers. In 1904 the Parisian newspaper &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; stated that &quot;Aster monopolised the mass manufacture of engines in France, and had a &#x27;universal reputation&#x27; and success shown by innumerable users.&quot; By 1912 they claimed to cater for over 130 makes.

A 12 hp Aster was exhibited at the 1903 Crystal Palace Motor Show. A range of Aster cars was sold in Britain between 1905 and 1907.

<text>Within Russian political parties, liberal parties advocate the expansion of political and civil freedoms and mostly oppose Vladimir Putin. In Russia, the term &quot;liberal&quot; can refer to wide range of politicians—simultaneously to Thatcherism/Reaganomics-related pro-capitalism conservative politicians (they are related to 1990s shock therapy &quot;liberal&quot; reforms), to centre-right liberal politicians (as in European political spectrum) and to left-liberal politicians (as in the US political spectrum). The term &quot;liberal democrats&quot; is often used for members of the far-right nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. There are Russian opposition and pro-government liberal political parties in Russia. Pro-government liberal politicians support Putin&#x27;s policy in economics.

There are no liberal factions in Russian parliament at the moment. Centre-left liberalism was represented in the State Duma of Russian parliament by the Russian United Democratic Party &quot;Yabloko&quot; (7.86% in 1993 election, 6.89% in 1995, 5.93% in 1999). Pro-government liberalism was represented by the Our Home – Russia (10.13% in 1995 election), the liberal political party founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Centre-right liberalism was represented by the pro-capitalist party Democratic Choice of Russia (15.51% in 1993) and its successor, the Union of Right Forces (8.52% in 1999 election).
Yabloko and the Republican Party of Russia – People&#x27;s Freedom Party are members of Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. Yabloko is also a member of Liberal International.

==Liberalism in the Russian Federation==
===History===
Liberalism emerged in Russia before the Russian Revolution and continued to develop among Constitutional Democrats such as Pavel Milyukov living in exile after 1917. After the fall of communism, several new liberal parties were formed, but only one of them Yabloko (&quot;Yabloko – Rosiyskaya Demokraticheskaya Partiya&quot;, a member of Liberal International) succeeded in becoming a relevant force. This is a left-of-center liberal party. The Union of Right Forces (&quot;Soyuz Pravykh Sil&quot;, a member of International Democrat Union) is a right-of-center liberal party. It can also be seen as a democratic conservative market party. In this scheme, the party is not included as liberal, being considered a democratic conservative party, but it can also be called liberal because of its pro-free-market and anti-authoritarianism stances. The so-called Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is not at all &quot;liberal&quot; – it is a nationalist, right-wing, populist party.

===Yabloko (1993–)===
*1993: Diverse new political parties merged into the social liberal Yavlinksii-Boldyrev-Lukin electoral bloc, led by Grigorii Yavlinskii.

*2003: The party is renamed Russian Democratic Party Yabloko (&quot;Rosiyskaya Demokraticheskaya Partiya/Российская Демократическая Партия Яблоко&quot;).

The Yabloko is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and Liberal International.

==Russian Empire==
===Background===
Mikhail Speransky is sometimes called the father of Russian liberalism. His ideas were discussed and elaborated by such 19th-century liberal republican radicals as Alexander Herzen, Boris Chicherin, and Konstantin Kavelin. Based on their ideals, various early 20th-century liberal parties evolved, the most important of them being the Constitutional-Democratic Party, headed by Pavel Milyukov.

===From Liberation Union to Constitutional Democratic Party===
*1905: &quot;The Liberation Union&quot; (&quot;Soyuz Osvobozhdeniya&quot;) merged with the &quot;Union of Zemstvo-Constitutionalists&quot; (&quot;Soyuz Zemstev-Konstitutsionistov&quot;) to form the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (&quot;Konstitutsiono-Demokraticheskaya Partya&quot;), formally known as the &quot;Party of Popular Freedom&quot; (&quot;Partiya Narodnoy Svobody&quot;), led by Pavel Milyukov.
*1906: A faction forms the ⇒ &quot;Party of Democratic Reform&quot;
*October 26 O.S., 1917: The party&#x27;s newspapers were shut down by the new Soviet regime
*November 28 O.S., 1917: Banned by the Soviet regime, the party went underground
*1918-1920: Many party leaders were active in the White movement
*1921-early 1930s: The party continued to function in exile, but slowly disintegrated

===Union of October 17===
*1905: Conservative liberals formed the Union of October 17 (&quot;Soyuz Semnadtsatovo Oktyabrya&quot;) and became known as &quot;Octobrists&quot;.
*1906: A left wing faction formed the ⇒ Party for Peaceful Renewal, the party develops to be the party of the landlords.
*March 1917: Dissolved after the February Revolution.

===Moderate Progressive Party===
*1905: National liberals established the Moderate Progressive Party (&quot;Umereno-Progresivnaya Partiya&quot;).
*1907: Merged into the ⇒ Party for Peaceful Renewal.

===Party of Democratic Reform===
*1906: A moderate faction of the ⇒ Constitutional Democratic Party formed the Party of Democratic Reform (&quot;Partiya Demokraticheskikh Reform&quot;).
*1912: Merged into the ⇒ Progressive Party.

===From Party of Peaceful Renovation to Progressist Party===
*1906: A left-wing faction of the Octobrists, together with dissidents of the Constitutional Democratic Party and of the Moderate Progressive Party, established the Party of Peaceful Renovation (&quot;Partiya Mirnovo Obnovleniya&quot;).
*1912: Merged with the ⇒ Party of Democratic Reform into the Progressist Party (&quot;Progresivnaya Partiya&quot;), led by Georgy Lvov.
*1917: Most of the party merged into the ⇒ Constitutional Democratic Party, some continued as the Radical Democratic Party (&quot;Radikal&#x27;no-Demokraticheskaya Partiya&quot;).

==List of various liberal leaders==

== Conclusion ==
Liberalism in Russia has undergone significant transformations from its early roots to contemporary challenges. While it has faced considerable obstacles from authoritarian regimes, it remains an essential part of Russia&#x27;s political discourse. The ongoing struggle for civil rights, democratic governance, and economic freedom continues to define the trajectory of liberal movements within the country.

<doc id="858183" wikidata="Q5475359" url="?curid=858183" title="Four Minute Mile">
<text>Four Minute Mile is the debut studio album by American rock band the Get Up Kids.

==Background==
The Get Up Kids evolved out of the breakup of Kingpin, which consisted of high school friends guitarist Jim Suptic, bassist Rob Pope and his brother drummer Ryan Pope. After that group&#x27;s demise, vocalist/guitarist Matt Pryor formed Secret Decoder Ring with Suptic, before they broke up after six months. Pryor and Suptic started working with Rob Pope, who invited college friend drummer Nathan Shay to form the Get Up Kids in 1994. Following this, the group self financed the 7&quot; single &quot;Shorty&quot;, which would sell over 2,000 copies. Shay moved to St. Louis, Missouri to focus on his studies, eventually leaving the group in April 1996. Ryan Pope joined initially on a temporary basis as there was concern with having both brothers in the band, and with Suptic and Pope not getting along in the past.

The group recorded two additional releases: one for Florida-based Outback Records, while the other was for Rhode Island–based Contrast Records. After recording four songs, the group sent copies of them to rock-centic labels listed in the publication &quot;The Musician&#x27;s Guide To Touring and Promotion&quot;. The songs caught the attention of Ohio-based Doghouse Records, who was interested in signing the band. They wanted to release a 7&quot; vinyl EP as a precursor to an album. Instead of recording another release, the group paid for the Outback release and issued it through Doghouse as the &quot;Woodson&quot; EP. The group subsequently signed a two-album recording contract with Doghouse.

==Recording==
&quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; was recorded in April 1997 on a budget of $4,000 with Shellac bassist Bob Weston acting as producer. Instead of recording at Red House Recordings, which they had used for the previous EP, they opted to track the record at the Chicago Recording Company. As Ryan Pope was still at school, the members went to a local music store to stock up on guitar strings and plectrums. They ended up running over a rock, and later found out it punctured the car&#x27;s exhaust manifold, causing carbon monoxide to circulate through the car and had to travel with the windows down. The members waited in the parking lot of Pope&#x27;s school, before he got in the car and they drove to Chicago. The recording sessions took place over the course of two and a half days from a Friday night to 3am on a Sunday.

When making the &quot;Woodson&quot; EP, the group tracked four songs and mixed them within one and a half days. They thought that since they were able to do four in one day, they would be able to do eleven in two and a half days for &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;. As a result, some of the songs featured the low quality production that the EP had; Pryor later stated they should have spent more time recording it, while Suptic said it &quot;sounds like crap&quot;. The short recording time was due to recording budget and also so that Pope wouldn&#x27;t miss school the following day. Pryor said Weston acted more in the vein of an engineer than a producer: &quot;He&#x27;s kind of like, &#x27;Do you like how it sounds?&#x27; &#x27;OK, yeah, it&#x27;s cool.&#x27;&quot; Weston mixed the recordings in a four-hour session.

==Release==
As the members had an album coming out, they came to the decision to take a year off from school to do the band full-time. Suptic and Pryor worked with Joe Winkle of Boys Life at Linda Hall Library. The pair learned that Boys Life were touring and used their contacts, coupled with Pryor&#x27;s copy of &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; &quot;Book Your Own Fucking Life&quot; guide, and started working on a touring route. This led the pair to Bob Nanna of Braid, who were also booking a tour in the same timeframe following the same route, deciding to go on tour together. In June 1997, the group went on a US tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve. During this tour, the Get Up Kids played a show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania with Coalesce, who they became friends with.

&quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; was released on September 30. Further tour outings included an east coat and southern tour with Jejune and Mineral in September, west coast tour with No Knife in October and November, and concluded the year with a north east tour with Jimmy Eat World in December. Ryan Pope had planned to go to college, until Doghouse offered to fund a European tour, which took place in February and March 1998 with Braid. The following month, they embarked on a southern tour, and a west coast tour with Braid in May. Following this, the group took a break, before eventually going on a nationwide tour supporting MxPx and Home Grown in October. After the conclusion of this tour, Coalesce drummer James Dewees joined as a keyboardist.

A remastered version of the album was released by Doghouse Records in 2001. This was largely a way of capitalizing on the recent success of the band&#x27;s second album, 1999&#x27;s Something to Write Home About, which rocketed the band to international stardom. In December 2008, Doghouse re-pressed the album on vinyl. Doghouse reissued the album, alongside &quot;The EP&#x27;s: Red Letter Day and Woodson&quot; compilation, on cassette in 2017.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical reception===

The album helped the band develop a national fanbase, as well as garnering a bidding war over the band from several major labels, including Geffen Records, Sub Pop Records and Mojo Records. The band ended up signing with Mojo, but was quickly disappointed with their choice when the label asked the band to re-record the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate Me&quot;, feeling that the label was underestimating their potential.

In a 2017 retrospective celebrating the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Vice Media called &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; &quot;a snapshot of a young band with their career ahead of them,&quot; that &quot;[t]he earnest candor of the lyrics coupled with the innovations in bridging punk and emo make this album a staple in emo&#x27;s history,&quot; and calling it a &quot;near-masterpiece.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the best emo albums of all time.

===Legacy===

&quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; is considered a benchmark album of the emo genre, influencing the likes of Saves the Day, the Early November, Midtown and Fall Out Boy. Frank Turner and Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance have expressed admiration for the album. In a 2005 interview with &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy remarked that the album had a major influence on the band as a whole. &quot;The first time I heard [The Get Up Kids] was around &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot;. I was in high school. There was an honesty and sincerity [to the album]. It seemed more about the fact that this music was &quot;emotional,&quot; than an actual sound than labeled them&quot;. In the same interview, he remarked that &quot;Fall Out Boy would not be a band if it were not for The Get Up Kids&quot;.

In 2020, BrooklynVegan included &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; on its list of the best punk albums of 1997, alongside Blink 182&#x27;s &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, and &quot;Nimrod&quot; by Green Day, writing that &quot;The Get Up Kids&#x27; 1997 debut album Four Minute Mile combined the driving, hooky indie-punk of Superchunk and the more tangled sounds of Midwest emo and helped create the blueprint for early/mid 2000s emo-pop in the process.&quot; They compared it favorably to the band&#x27;s later defining work Something to Write Home About; &quot;STWHA is nearly perfect but Four Minute Mile is charmingly flawed, and sometimes you&#x27;re craving something rawer and punkier than the more polished-up and ballad-inclusive Something To Write Home About.&quot;

&quot;LA Weekly&quot; included &quot;Four Minute Mile&quot; as one of the 20 greatest emo albums of all time.

<doc id="858185" wikidata="Q6540888" url="?curid=858185" title="Liberalism in Australia">
<text>In Australia, liberalism has a vast interpretation and a broad definition. It dates back to the earliest Australian pioneers and has maintained a strong foothold to the present day. Modern-day Australian liberalism is the successor to colonial liberalism, and has been compared to British liberalism for its similarity. The primary representation (and political entity) of Australian liberalism is the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia. Unlike in the United States, liberalism in Australia, and the term &quot;liberal&quot;, is often associated with conservatism.

==Introduction==
Some of the earliest pioneers of the federation movement, men such as Alfred Deakin, came under the influence of David Syme of &quot;The Age&quot;. Other influencers of federalism included Samuel Griffith who, while initially seen as a supporter of the labour movement, became partisan against the Labour movement with his legal intervention in the 1891 Australian Shearers&#x27; strike. While all of these men were generally self-described &quot;liberals&quot;, their understanding of liberalism differed substantially. At the time, Deakin was sometimes described as a &quot;radical&quot;, and was disliked by both urban conservatives, and the squatting class of Australia. (However, Deakin was also consistently opposed to Labor, instrumental in the fusion of the centre-right parties, a strong supporter of the White Australia policy, and a prominent proponent of stronger trade and defence ties to the British Empire – a position that gained him admirers amongst tories in the UK.) The degree of progressive sentiments also varied from colony to colony: social liberals such as David Syme were prominent in Victoria while others were prominent in South Australia, for instance. At any rate, Australia&#x27;s parliamentary institutions, especially at a national level, were brand-new, so it was difficult for anyone to be labelled &quot;conservative&quot; in a traditional sense. The two largest political parties, the Free Trade Party and the Protectionist Party, could both loosely be described as &quot;liberal&quot; in the terms of the time. They were moderates with a strong belief in parliamentary institutions, financially orthodox and attached to the British Empire, with a distaste for radicalism. The third major political force was the trade union movement represented by the Australian Labor Party. The rise in popularity of the Labor Party became the major preoccupation of these two other parties.

In the early stages of the parliament, the Labor Party engaged in a partnership with the more radical Protectionists, but Labor&#x27;s wide-ranging policies for social reform met with only lukewarm support from most Protectionists. Fear of socialism became widespread among the ranks of the establishment, and as the question of tariffs was settled, there was increasing pressure on the non-Labor parliamentary forces to unite in opposition to Labor.

The result was the Fusion in 1909, composed of Joseph Cook&#x27;s Anti-Socialist Party (formerly Free Trade Party), and conservative Protectionists. The Fusion soon began calling itself the Liberal Party, proclaiming its adherence to classical liberalism. After Deakin&#x27;s departure, the fervent anti-socialist Joseph Cook became leader of the party and it became the dominant right-wing force in Australian politics.

The pattern of a non-Labor party defining itself as &quot;liberal&quot; rather than &quot;conservative&quot; and deriving support from a middle-class base continued to the formation of the present-day Liberal Party, founded in 1945 and led initially by Sir Robert Menzies. Malcolm Fraser, quoting from Menzies&#x27; memoir, &quot;Afternoon Light&quot;, described the decision to call the party &quot;Liberal&quot; in these terms, 
We chose the word &#x27;Liberal&#x27; because we want to be a progressive party, in no way conservative, in no way reactionary.

However, previous Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, is reported to have described himself the most conservative leader the Liberal Party had ever had.

The &quot;wet&quot; (moderate) and &quot;dry&quot; (conservative) wings of the Liberal party co-operated fairly harmoniously, but in the early 1970s as conservatives started to dominate in South Australia liberals led by Steele Hall broke off to form the Liberal Movement. In 1977, other dissident &#x27;small-l liberal&#x27; forces led by Don Chipp created the Australian Democrats.

==Contemporary Australian liberalism==
From the early 1990s, social conservatism has characterised the Liberal Party&#x27;s actions in Government and policy development. Former Prime Minister John Howard in a 2005 speech described the modern position:

The Liberal Party is a broad church. You sometimes have to get the builders in to put in the extra pew on both sides of the aisle to make sure that everybody is accommodated. But it is a broad church and we should never as members of the Liberal Party of Australia lose sight of the fact that we are the trustees of two great political traditions. We are, of course, the custodian of the classical liberal tradition within our society, Australian Liberals should revere the contribution of John Stuart Mill to political thought. We are also the custodians of the conservative tradition in our community. And if you look at the history of the Liberal Party it is at its best when it balances and blends those two traditions. Mill and Burke are interwoven into the history and the practice and the experience of our political party.

Federal &quot;small-l liberals&quot;, such as Joe Hockey and Malcolm Turnbull were Cabinet ministers in the Howard government. Christopher Pyne , George Brandis and Bruce Billson served in the outer ministry. In 2018, members of this grouping made up the substantial majority of senior cabinet and ministry positions in the government of small-l liberal Turnbull. At the state level, &quot;small-l liberals&quot; have substantial influence particularly in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.

The Democrats, fractured under the leadership of Cheryl Kernot and Natasha Stott Despoja, moved to the left. Party leader Meg Lees formed the more avowedly centrist Australian Progressive Alliance in 2003. In 2002, Tasmanian Liberal candidate Greg Barns was disendorsed following comments opposing Government action taken over the Tampa affair. Barns joined the Australian Democrats, with the view of returning a strong liberal platform to the party.

<text>The Fender Showmaster is a discontinued model of electric guitar made by Fender, and is characteristic of a superstrat.

== History ==
During the 1980s, superstrats were becoming popular amongst the many hard rock and metal guitarists, who needed the modifications to suit their individual playing styles. Soon, many guitar manufacturers began producing instruments with these modifications as standard. Most notable were the manufacturers Ibanez, Jackson/Charvel, Carvin and Yamaha. However, Fender itself had limited success thereabout. This was partially due to Fender&#x27;s previous CBS ownership, which caused a drastic loss in Fender&#x27;s quality and market share. The Showmaster was hence its most recent foray into the superstrat niche, and was introduced in 1998. Gene Baker, a master builder of Fender&#x27;s Custom Shop at the time, was responsible for the creation of this set-neck, carved top version. Early Showmaster models (prototypes) were originally labeled as Stratocasters on their headstocks and are very rare. The Custom Shop Showmaster perimeter was a design supplied by John Suhr, another Senior master builder during that era. It started out as a US version of the Contemporary Stratocaster and featured two Fender Texas Special pickups in the neck and middle positions, a Seymour Duncan &#x27;59 Jeff Beck Trembucker in the lead position, a white pearloid pickguard and a deluxe locking tremolo bridge. Later after Suhr left it was turned into a back-routed carved set neck by Gene Baker. Suhr&#x27;s new company Suhr Guitars actually cut the first 100 bodies for Fender.

== Construction ==
:&quot;Note: In descriptions of pickup configurations, H refers to humbuckers and S refers to single-coils.&quot;

The Fender Showmaster initially started as a Custom Shop model. It featured a carved maple top with hand scraped edges and cream binding, a set-neck maple neck (bolt-on on some models), a sleek mahogany body (many Showmaster guitars are made from basswood or alder; later models such as the Showmaster Elite, employ more exotic woods such as lacewood and spalted maple for the top and back), HSS or HH pickup configurations which consisted of Seymour Duncan &#x27;59 Trembucker humbucking pickups coupled with a pair of Fender Custom Shop Fat &#x27;50s single-coils. Other features included a rosewood or maple fingerboard with abalone inlays and 22 frets, as well as a choice of deluxe locking tremolo bridge, deluxe 2-point synchronized bridge with pop-in tremolo arm and stop-tail bridge (some Team Built one-off Showmasters came with the original Floyd Rose locking system and featured a lightweight ash body and a translucent Amber finish). Later, it appeared as a U.S. Special/Highway 1 model, retaining the set maple neck, Fender Enforcer humbuckers, a special &quot;kill&quot; switch and its traditional Stratocaster headstock (with Showmaster label, respectively), equipped with a Floyd Rose licensed vibrato and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard. Some later Showmasters—such as the Elite—were produced in Korea, followed by Squier variants (formerly known as &quot;Stagemasters&quot;) featuring a basswood body, a reverse headstock, Floyd Rose licensed locking systems and Duncan Designed humbucking pickups.

All Showmaster carved top models featured back-routed controls like most superstrats and came with a choice of bridges, abalone-inlaid rosewood fretboards with 24 frets, Seymour Duncan pickups, locking machine heads, and an LSR roller nut. The Blackout version came with a graphite nut, no fretboard inlays and Fender humbuckers instead of Seymour Duncan on some variants.

The main distinguishing feature of Fender Showmasters—with the exception of the Flat Head—from other superstrats is the luxurious carved (quilted and flamed) maple top with the hand-scraped edges and cream binding. The Showmaster series also included a short-lived 7-string version with a stop-tail bridge that had been introduced around 1999/2000 and discontinued two years later. The most distinct feature of the Showmaster Elites was the inclusion of a black-painted Telecaster-shaped headstock with pearloid tuner buttons.

In 2009, all Showmaster models were discontinued.

== Squier models ==

Squier, Fender&#x27;s budget marque, also produced the Showmaster. Most Squier Showmasters were made in China and retailed for $499. The line included a Jason Ellis signature model. There were Squier Showmasters marked &quot;Crafted in Indonesia&quot; as well (specs: HSS, 22 frets, rosewood fretboard, standard 2-point vibrato).

A few Korean made Squier neck-thru V4 Stagemasters were re-branded Squier Showmasters in 2002 when Fender dropped the Stagemaster name due to a trademark claim by Kramer. It is not known exactly how many V4 neck-thrus were made with the Showmaster brand.

<text>Liberalism () has been a major trend in Canadian politics since the late 18th century. Canada has the same features of other liberal democracies in the Western democratic political tradition. This article gives an overview of liberalism in Canada. It includes a brief history of liberal parties with substantial representation in parliament.

==Liberal parties==
Liberal parties developed in both the French and English speaking parts of Canada; these developments led to the formation of the Liberal Party of Canada. Liberal parties exist on a provincial level; however, while they mostly share similar ideologies, not all provincial parties are officially affiliated with the federal party.

In Canada, a &quot;capital-L&quot; &quot;Liberal&quot; refers to the policies and ideas of the Liberal Party of Canada/&quot;Parti Libéral du Canada&quot; (member LI), the most frequent governing party of Canada for the last century and one of the largest liberal parties around the world. The Quebec Liberal Party (&quot;Parti libéral du Québec&quot;) combines liberalism with more conservative ideas. Only federal parties are included in the following timeline. For inclusion in this scheme, it is not necessary for parties to have explicitly labelled themselves as a liberal party.

In 2023, The Saskatchewan Liberal Party changed its name to the Saskatchewan Progress Party, in the same year the British Columbia Liberal Party changed its name to BC United. 
===Timeline of the federal Liberal Party===

====Canadian Party / Patriot Party / Red Party====
*1806: Liberals in the Francophone part of Canada formed the Canadian Party (&quot;Parti Canadien&quot;)
*1826: The party is renamed Patriot Party (&quot;Parti Patriote&quot;) and is led by Louis-Joseph Papineau
*1848: The party is further reorganised into the Red Party (&quot;Parti rouge&quot;)
*1867: The PR merged into the present-day Liberal Party of Canada

====Reform Party====
*1841: The Upper Canada Reform Party is formed
*1855: Radical members formed the Clear Grits.
*1867: The Reform Party merged into Liberal Party of Canada

====Clear Grits / Liberal Party of Canada====
*1855: Radical members of the Reform Party formed the Clear Grits
*1867: The Clear Grits merged with the Reform Party, the Red Party and provincial liberal parties into the present-day Liberal Party of Canada

===Current parties===
In addition to the federal party, each province and the Yukon territory has its own Liberal Party; however, those in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are no longer affiliated with the federal party. Under their system of consensus government, political parties are not recognized in the territories of Nunavut and Northwest Territories.

<text>The Astra was an American automobile manufactured in 1920. The car was built by a subsidiary concern of Dorris Motors Corporation, and was shown that year in its native St. Louis, Missouri. It featured a wheelbase, a Le Roi four-cylinder engine, and a slightly pointed radiator. Some five or ten units were built before the company failed in June 1920.

<doc id="858193" wikidata="Q6540918" url="?curid=858193" title="Historic liberalism in New Zealand">
<text>This article gives an overview of historic liberalism in New Zealand. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had representation in parliament.

==Terminology==
In New Zealand, the term &quot;liberalism&quot; has been used by a large variety of groups and organisations, but usually refers to a support for individual liberties and limited government. The term is generally used only with a reference to a particular policy area, e.g. &quot;market liberalism&quot; or &quot;social liberalism&quot;. In its extreme form it can be known as &quot;libertarianism&quot;, although this term is used less in New Zealand than in some other countries. Some historians claim that liberalism was a dominant force in New Zealand until around 1936, citing the strong position of the Liberal Party. However, there is (and always was) debate as to whether the Liberal Party was actually liberal—according to some observers, it would be better described as &quot;socialist&quot;, although this was a common accusation made against early 20th century liberals, around the world.

Today, there is no party which is universally recognised as &quot;the party of liberalism&quot;, although there are parties which attempt to claim this title—ACT New Zealand, for example, has labelled itself as &quot;the Liberal Party&quot;. However, both major parties in New Zealand, the Labour Party and the National Party, have incorporated aspects of liberalism into their current agenda, with the former embracing social liberalism and the latter economic liberalism.

==Timeline==
===Liberal Party / United Party===
*1891: John Ballance, upon becoming Prime Minister, founds the Liberal Party. It is later led by Richard Seddon and Joseph Ward, among others, although some historians contend that none of the later leaders had the same ideological commitment to liberalism as Ballance and his allies.
*1927: Remnants of the party absorb the United New Zealand Political Organisation, adopting the name &quot;United Party&quot;. The new party is led by George Forbes.
*1936: The party merges with the conservative Reform Party to form the National Party.

===Democrat Party===
*1934: Prominent &quot;anti-socialist&quot; political organiser Albert Davy founds the Democrat Party, with a strong focus on economic liberalism.
*1935: The Democrats capture eight percent of the vote, but no seats.

===New Zealand Party===
*1983: Bob Jones, a wealthy property tycoon, founds the New Zealand Party to promote both economic and social liberalism. Some consider the party to be mildly libertarian.
*1984: The New Zealand Party captures twelve percent of the vote, but no seats.

==Liberal leaders==
*George Grey
*Julius Vogel
*Robert Stout
*John Ballance
*Richard Seddon
*Joseph Ward

<text>William S. Bowdern (February 13, 1897 – April 25, 1983) was a Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the author of &quot;The Problems of Courtship and Marriage&quot; printed by &quot;Our Sunday Visitor&quot; in 1939. He was a graduate of and taught at St. Louis University High School; he also taught at Saint Louis University. 

Bowdern participated in an exorcism of Roland Doe in 1949. The incident became the basis of William Peter Blatty&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

==Exorcism==

In 1949, Bowdern was assisted in the exorcism of an anonymously named boy by fellow Jesuit priest Walter Halloran. Author William Peter Blatty contacted Bowdern as part of his research for his novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. In a 2000 TV movie titled &quot;Possessed&quot;, Bowdern was played by Timothy Dalton.

<text>Hayward, or &quot;hedge warden&quot;, was an officer of an English parish dating from the Middle Ages in charge of fences and enclosures; also, a herdsman in charge of cattle and other animals grazing on common land. Their main job was to protect the crops of the village from livestock.

In Sussex and Surrey the form Haybittle occurs (from Old French, &quot;haia&quot;, enclosure and Anglo-Saxon &quot;bydel&quot;, bailiff). This has survived as a locally common surname, especially in and around Reigate.

<text>The Astra, Little Horse, was an English car built by a subsidiary of British Anzani of Hampton Hill, Middlesex from 1954 until 1959. At GBP348 it claimed to be the smallest and cheapest four-wheeler on the British market. The car had originally been built by JARC motors and sold as the Little Horse.

==Car==
It featured a rear-mounted air-cooled, twin-cylinder engine mounted under the floor driving the rear wheels through a three-speed motorcycle-type gearbox. The steel channel section chassis had all-round independent suspension with swing axles at the rear. Most cars had two seater estate car bodies, but some four-seat saloons were also made. The bodies were made of aluminium. The car could also be bought in kit form. It was claimed to be able to reach and return .

After production ceased, some coupés were made by Gill cars and sold as the Getabout. The rights were also bought by Harold Lightburn of Camden, Adelaide, Australia who fitted a new glass-fibre estate body and sold the car as the Zeta between 1963 and 1966.

<text>The Astra-Gnome is a concept car by industrial designer Richard Arbib using a 1955 Nash Metropolitan chassis. It was described as a &quot;Time and Space Car&quot;. It features themes influenced by the space travel forms that were popular during the 1950s. The vehicle represented Arbib&#x27;s vision of what an automobile would look like in the year 2000.

==Design==
American Motors Corporation commissioned Richard Arbib, a leading industrial designer of the 1950s, to develop a futuristic concept car. Built in four months, the Astra-Gnome represented the work of product stylists to create &quot;new and exciting shapes, textures and colors in a functional car.&quot; Arbib had the wheels and tires hidden behind full fender skirts to achieve &quot;a floating special quality&quot; and to suggest a spacecraft or hovercraft. The objective was to build excitement &quot;about the cool stuff the 21st century was going to hold.&quot; Arbib described it not being a sports car or having any European-origin styling. Instead, he made it to have &quot;a pert, futuristic manner ... sculptural and alive in its contours&quot;. The concept car blends futuristic aesthetics with functional design and is a fully operational vehicle.

The car was featured on the 3 September 1956 cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. The Astra-Gnome was a highlight at the 1956 New York International Auto Show. About 1,000 questionnaire cards were distributed to viewers at the auto show, with results indicating an 80% favorable response to the prototype. Numerous photos of the car with Arbib were often accompanied by attractive female models who explained to the media that the concept was never intended for production. The Astra-Gnome was featured in trade publications and popular magazines, such part of a fashion spread in &quot;Esquire&quot;.

Andrew Mazzara manufactured the body. was built in a light-speed quick four months. Despite a 25% increase in size over the original Metropolitan body, the total weight remains under . About of aluminum castings and extrusions were used, including fluted aluminum side panels that had been anodized in different blending colors. The hood features a futuristic gnome/astronaut logo, which also appears on the tailfin, and the taillights have a 1950s look. The bubble canopy provides unobstructed all-around vision while covering the passengers. A motor-driven aluminum arm opens the canopy from the back to allow walk-in entry and exit. The interior features bucket seats upholstered in blue and &quot;space-age&quot; gray upholstery with an integrated center console between them. An Astra-Gnome logo adorns the center of the chromed blue steering wheel. The control knobs, along with the gear shifter knob, are clear and transparent blue.

Among its many features is a Hamilton &quot;celestial time-zone clock permitting actual flight-type navigation.&quot; The acrylic glass bubble canopy also served as a sound chamber for the car&#x27;s high fidelity radio and record player. The car included air conditioning and wrap-around bumper protection that was matched to the height of full-sized car bumpers. The width of the concept car was much greater than contemporary passenger automobiles and allowed for extra interior room, as well as storage and luggage spaces that included six pieces of matched integrated luggage. The design made parking the wide Astra-Gnome easier by making the curb visible from the car.

The concept car &quot;disappeared into oblivion&quot; after its exhibition to be recovered from a sealed high-rise office in New York City in 1980. The car is restored and can be seen in a California museum.

<text>Jozua François &quot;Tom&quot; Naudé (15 April 1889 – 31 May 1969) was a South African politician who served as acting state president of South Africa from 1967 to 1968.

A National Party politician for many years, he served as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs from 1950 to 1954, as Minister of Health from 1954 to 1958, and as Minister of Finance from 1958 to 1961. He was then appointed President of the Senate of South Africa, and in terms of the South African Constitution of 1961 he would be required &quot;ex officio&quot; under a dormant commission to act as State President of South Africa whenever that office was vacant. He was unexpectedly called upon to do this when Dr Eben Dönges, who was elected to succeed C.R. Swart as State President in 1967, suffered a stroke and fell into a coma before he could be inaugurated. Naudé was Acting State President for ten months, until Dönges died and Jim Fouché was inaugurated in his place.

Tom Naudé Technical High School in Polokwane was named after him.
