<text>Charles Thomas McKinnon &quot;Chic&quot; Murray (6 November 1919 – 29 January 1985) was a Scottish comedian and actor. He appeared in various roles on British television and film, most notably in the 1967 version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and portrayed Liverpool Football Club manager Bill Shankly in a musical.

== Life and career ==
Murray was born in Greenock, Renfrewshire. He began his career as a musician in amateur groups such as &quot;The Whinhillbillies&quot; and &quot;Chic and His Chicks&quot; while an apprentice at the Kincaid shipyard in 1934. Maidie Dickson (1922–2010) - Murray&#x27;s future wife - was already a seasoned star in her own right (having worked since she was 3, when she was playing the Greenock Empire). Chic&#x27;s mother was the welfare officer and put Maidie up in her home. Subsequently, Maidie gave Chic parts within her own act and he formed a double-act with her. Billed as &quot;The Tall Droll with the Small Doll&quot; (he was 6&#x27;3&quot; tall, she was 4&#x27;11&quot;) and also as &quot;Maidie and Murray&quot;, their combination of jokes and songs made them popular on television and in theatres throughout the country. Their success peaked in 1956 when they were selected to appear in the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium, but, due to the Suez Crisis, the show was cancelled. Maidie and Chic had had much success at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London.

Later, working as a solo act, with a forbidding expression and omnipresent , Murray offered a comic vision of the world that was absurd and surreal. One example was his early-1970s BBC Scotland series &quot;Chic&#x27;s Chat&quot;, where his version of acting as DJ for the (occasional) records he played was unique. The show also featured surreal dialogues with a &quot;man at the window&quot; of his studio, played by Willie Joss, who invariably referred to Murray by the name of &quot;Chips&quot;. Another was his eccentrically decorated hotel in the Bruntsfield area of Edinburgh, which did not outlive the 1980s.

Murray acted in films such as &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot;, in which he played a Scottish secondary school headmaster. He also played former Liverpool Football Club manager Bill Shankly in the musical play &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. Just prior to the show opening, Murray claimed to have telephoned the switchboard at Anfield using his Shankly voice, causing the receptionist – who had worked there in the Shankly years – to burst into tears on hearing his voice once more. He also made cameo appearances as an itinerant poacher in a few episodes of STV&#x27;s soap &quot;Take The High Road&quot; (1984) and appeared alongside Judi Dench in &quot;&quot; (1983) as a bank manager.

One of Murray&#x27;s last TV appearances was as a first-footer on the BBC Scotland Hogmanay show &quot;Live into 85&quot;.

He died in Edinburgh in 1985 after he suffered a perforated ulcer at the age of 65, next door to his former wife Maidie&#x27;s bedroom. (They had divorced in the 1970s but remained on good terms.) Tributes during his funeral at Mortonhall Crematorium were led by fellow Scottish comedian Billy Connolly.

== Legacy ==
&quot;The Chic Murray Story&quot; was a play written by Andrew Dallmeyer and performed by Doug Healy at the 1997 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Although initially successful, later performances led to legal threats from the Murray family who felt the use of his material breached copyright.

&quot;Chic Murray: A Funny Place for a Window&quot;, written and directed by Stuart Hepburn, and starring Dave Anderson in the title role, was performed in the &quot;A Play, a Pie and a Pint&quot; lunchtime series of plays at the Òran Mór in Kelvinside, Glasgow in May 2018. Chic&#x27;s wife, Madie Dickson was played by Maureen Carr. The third member of the cast, Brian O&#x27;Sullivan, played &#x27;the ensemble&#x27;. The Glasgow Herald review of the play said, &#x27;&quot;The most animated thing in the production was the energetic and multi-talented O’Sullivan charging on and off stage as he switched characters.&quot; A performance was filmed for the BBC and broadcast on 1 September 2019.

In 2005, Murray was named &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, in a poll where comedians chose their favourite or most influential comedian.

&quot;Neither Here nor There&quot; is a BBC Radio 2 programme about Murray&#x27;s life, devised and scripted by Simon Treves and originally broadcast in August 2007.

<text>Charles Murray (27 September 1864 – 12 April 1941) was a poet who wrote in the Doric dialect of Scots. He was one of three rural poets from the north-east of Scotland, the others being Flora Garry and John C. Milne, who did much to validate the literary use of Scots.

==Biography==

Charles Murray was born and raised in Alford in north-east Scotland. However he wrote much of his poetry while living in South Africa where he spent most of his working life as a successful civil engineer. His first volume, &quot;A Handful of Heather&quot; (1893), was privately printed and he withdrew it shortly after publication to rework many of the poems within it. His second volume, &quot;Hamewith&quot; (1900), was much more successful. It was republished five times before he died and it is this volume for which he is best known. The title of the volume, which means &quot;Homewards&quot; in English, reflects his expatriate situation.

He served in the Armed Forces during the Second Boer War and the First World War and in 1917 produced the volume, &quot;The Sough o&#x27; War&quot;. The poems from this anthology were entitled: Ye&#x27;re better men, A sough o&#x27; war, Wha bares a blade for Scotland?, To the hin&#x27;most man, The thraws o&#x27; fate, The wife on the war, Fae France, Bundle an&#x27; go, When will the war be by?, Dockens afore his peers, At the loanin&#x27; mou&#x27;, Lat&#x27;s hear the pipes, Hairy hears fae hame, and Furth again.

He published his last volume, &quot;In the Country Places&quot;, in 1920. After his death a final volume of poetry, &quot;Last Poems&quot; was published by the Charles Murray Memorial Trust in 1969.

He returned to Scotland when he retired in 1924 and settled in Banchory, not far from where he was brought up. There he died in 1941.

<doc id="869373" wikidata="Q159525" url="?curid=869373" title="Salicornia">
<text>Salicornia is a genus of succulent, halophytic (salt tolerant) flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae that grow in salt marshes, on beaches, and among mangroves. &quot;Salicornia&quot; species are native to North America, Europe, central Asia, and southern Africa. Common names for the genus include [[glasswort]], [[pickleweed]], picklegrass, and marsh [[samphire]]; these common names are also used for some species not in &quot;Salicornia&quot;. To French speakers in Atlantic Canada, they are known colloquially as (&#x27;mouse tits&#x27;). The main European species is often eaten, called marsh samphire in Britain, and the main North American species is occasionally sold in grocery stores or appears on restaurant menus as sea beans, samphire greens or sea asparagus.

== Description ==
The &quot;Salicornia&quot; species are small annual herbs. They grow prostrate to erect, their simple or branched stems are succulent, hairless, and appear to be jointed. The opposite leaves are strongly reduced to small fleshy scales with a narrow dry margin, hairless, unstalked and united at the base, thus enclosing and forming a succulent sheath around the stem, which gives it the appearance of being composed of jointed segments. Many species are green, but their foliage turns red in autumn. Older stems may be somewhat woody basally. 

All stems terminate in spike-like apparently jointed inflorescences. Each joint consists of two opposite minute bracts with a (1-) 3-flowered cyme tightly embedded in cavities of the main axis and partly hidden by the bracts. The flowers are arranged in a triangle, both lateral flowers beneath the central flower. The hermaphrodite flowers are more or less radially symmetric, with a perianth of three fleshy tepals united nearly to the apex. There are 1–2 stamens and an ovary with two stigmas.

The perianth is persistent in fruit. The fruit wall (pericarp) is membranous. The vertical seed is ellipsoid, with yellowish brown, membranous, hairy seed coat. The seed contains no perisperm (feeding tissue).

Like most members of the subfamily Salicornioideae, &quot;Salicornia&quot; species use the C3 carbon fixation pathway to take in carbon dioxide from the surrounding atmosphere.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Salicornia&quot; was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. &quot;Salicornia europaea&quot; was selected as the type species.

The genus probably originated during the Miocene in the region between the Mediterranean Basin and Central Asia. Evolving from within the perennial and frost-sensitive former genus &quot;Sarcocornia&quot; (now shown to be paraphyletic), the annual, strongly inbreeding and frost-tolerant &quot;Salicornia&quot; diversified during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. By events of intercontinental dispersals, they reached southern Africa twice and North America at least three times. Two tetraploid lineages expanded rapidly, with the ability to colonize lower belts of the salt marshes than their diploid relatives. Inbreeding and geographical isolation led to a large number of reproductive isolated species that are only weakly differentiated.

The taxonomic classification of this genus is extremely difficult (with one paper calling it a &quot;taxonomic nightmare&quot;). The determination of species seems almost impossible for non-specialists. The reasons for these difficulties are the reduced habit with weak morphological differentiation and high phenotypic variability. As the succulent plants lose their characteristics while drying, herbarium specimens often cannot be determined with certainty and are less suited for taxonomic studies.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have regularly revised the circumscription of the genus. It was considered distinct from &quot;Sarcocornia&quot; in 2007 and 2012 studies. A 2017 study resulted in &quot;Sarcocornia&quot; being sunk into &quot;Salicornia&quot;, substantially increasing the size of the genus, which was divided into four subgenera.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species of &quot;Salicornia&quot; are widely distributed over the Northern Hemisphere and in southern Africa, ranging from the subtropics to subarctic regions. There is one species present in New Zealand.

They grow in coastal salt marshes and in inland salty habitats like shores of salt lakes. &quot;Salicornia&quot; species are halophytes and can generally tolerate immersion in salt water (hygrohalophytes).

== Ecology ==
&quot;Salicornia&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the &quot;Coleophora&quot; case-bearers &quot;C. atriplicis&quot; and &quot;C. salicorniae&quot;; the latter feeds exclusively on &quot;Salicornia&quot; spp.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
&quot;S. europaea&quot; is edible, either cooked or raw, as are &quot;S. rubra&quot; and &quot;S. depressa&quot;. In England, &quot;S. europaea&quot; is one of several plants known as &quot;samphire&quot; (including rock samphire); the term samphire is believed to be a corruption of the French name, &quot;[herbe de] Saint-Pierre&quot;, which means &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s herb&quot;.

In Hawaii, where it is known as &#x27;sea asparagus&#x27;, it is often blanched and used as a topping for salads or accompaniment for fish.

In addition to &quot;S. europaea&quot;, the seeds of &quot;S. bigelovii&quot; yield an edible oil. &quot;S. bigelovii&quot;&#x27;s edibility is compromised somewhat because it contains saponins, which are toxic under certain conditions.

Umari keerai (&quot;S. brachiata&quot;) is cooked and eaten or pickled. It is also used as fodder for cattle, sheep and goats. In Kalpitiya, Sri Lanka, it is used to feed donkeys.

On the east coast of Canada, the plant is known as &#x27;samphire greens&#x27; and is a local delicacy. In southeast Alaska, it is known as beach asparagus. In Nova Scotia, Canada, they are known as crow&#x27;s foot greens. In British Columbia, they are known as sea asparagus. In the United States, they are known as &#x27;sea beans&#x27; when used for culinary purposes. Other names include sea green bean, sea pickle, and marsh samphire.

In India, researchers at the Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute developed a process to yield culinary salt from &quot;S. brachiata.&quot; The resulting product is known as &quot;vegetable salt&quot; and sold under the brand name Saloni.

Dehydrated, pulverized &quot;Salicornia&quot; is sold under the brand name &quot;Green Salt&quot; as a salt substitute claimed to be as salty in taste as table salt, but with less sodium.

=== Pharmacological research ===
In South Korea, Phyto Corporation has developed a technology of extracting low-sodium salt from &quot;S. europaea&quot;, a salt-accumulating plant. The company claims that the naturally derived plant salt is effective in treating high blood pressure and fatty liver disease by reducing sodium intake. The company has also developed a desalted &quot;Salicornia&quot; powder containing antioxidative and antithrombus polyphenols, claimed to be effective in treating obesity and arteriosclerosis, as well as providing a means to help resolve global food shortages.

=== Environmental uses ===

Pickleweed is used in phytoextraction. It is highly effective at removing selenium from soil, which is absorbed by the plant and then released into the atmosphere to be dispersed by prevailing winds. Pickleweed (&quot;S. bigelovii&quot;) has been found to have average volatilization rates 10–100 times higher than other species.

=== Industrial use ===

==== Historical ====

The ashes of glasswort and saltwort plants and of kelp were long used as a source of soda ash (mainly sodium carbonate) for glassmaking and soapmaking. The introduction of the LeBlanc process for industrial production of soda ash superseded the use of plant sources in the first half of the 19th century.

Umari keerai is used as raw material in paper and board factories.

==== Contemporary ====
Because &quot;S. bigelovii&quot; can be grown using saltwater and its seeds contain high levels of unsaturated oil (30 wt. %, mostly linoleic acid) and protein (35 wt. %), it can be used to produce animal feedstuff and as a biofuel feedstock on coastal land where conventional crops cannot be grown. Adding nitrogen-based fertiliser to the seawater appears to increase the rate of growth and the eventual height of the plant, and the effluent from marine aquaculture (e.g. shrimp farming) is a suggested use for this purpose.

Experimental fields of &quot;Salicornia&quot; have been planted in Ras al-Zawr (Saudi Arabia), Eritrea (northeast Africa) and Sonora (northwest Mexico) aimed at the production of biodiesel. The company responsible for the Sonora trials (Global Seawater ) claims between 225 and 250 gallons of BQ-9000 biodiesel can be produced per hectare (approximately 2.5 acres) of salicornia, and is promoting a $35 million scheme to create a salicornia farm in Bahia de Kino.

Stems and roots of &quot;S. brachiata&quot; plants have a high cellulose content (ca. 30 wt. %), whereas tender stem tips exhibit a low cellulose content (9.2 wt. %). &quot;S. brachiata&quot; revealed the dominance of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, with meager presence of ribose and xylose in their structural polysaccharide.

<doc id="869375" wikidata="Q1810294" url="?curid=869375" title="Camassia">
<text>Camassia is a genus of plants in the asparagus family native to North America. Common names include camas, quamash, Indian hyacinth, camash, and wild hyacinth.

It grows in the wild in great numbers in moist meadows. They are perennial plants with basal linear leaves measuring in length, which emerge early in the spring. They grow to a height of , with a multi-flowered stem rising above the main plant in summer. The six-petaled flowers vary in color from pale lilac or white to deep purple or blue-violet. Camas can appear to color entire meadows when in flower.

==Taxonomy and species==
Historically, the genus was placed in the lily family (Liliaceae), when this was very broadly defined to include most lilioid monocots. When the Liliaceae was split, in some treatments &quot;Camassia&quot; was placed in a family called Hyacinthaceae (now the subfamily Scilloideae). DNA and biochemical studies have led the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to reassign &quot;Camassia&quot; to the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae.

===Species===
The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes six species :
* &quot;Camassia angusta&quot; - prairie camas - southern Great Plains + mid-Mississippi Valley (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana)
* &quot;Camassia cusickii&quot; - Cusick&#x27;s camas - northeastern Oregon, west-central Idaho
* &quot;Camassia howellii&quot; - Howell&#x27;s camas - southwestern Oregon
* &quot;Camassia leichtlinii&quot; - large camas, great camas - British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, northern + central California, Washoe County in Nevada
* &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; - quamash, Indian camas, small camas - western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta), western United States (California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah)
* &quot;Camassia scilloides&quot; - Atlantic camas, bear grass - eastern + Central North America from Maryland to Georgia, westward to Texas and north into Ontario.

;formerly included
The name &quot;Camassia biflora&quot; was coined in 1969 for a South American species now known as &quot;Oziroe biflora.&quot;

=== Synonyms ===
The term &quot;Camassia esculenta&quot; is a confusing one. Not an accepted name, it has been used twice, both for &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; and for &quot;Camassia scilloides&quot;. Consequently, the reference to &quot;Camassia esculenta&quot; (Ker Gawl.) B.L.Rob. as a synonym for &quot;C. scilloides&quot; is deemed illegitimate, while reference to &quot;Camassia esculenta&quot; (Nutt.) Lindl. is a non-accepted name (synonym) for &quot;C. quamash subsp. quamash&quot;. Hence the continuing horticultural usage without qualification is potentially confusing.

==Cultivation and uses==

=== Indigenous methods of cultivation ===
Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest engaged in active management and cultivation of blue camas (Kweetla). They used controlled burning to clear land and improve growing conditions. While blue camas plots occurred naturally in the Pacific Northwest, Indigenous peoples would maintain a plot through weeding, tilling, harvesting Camas bulbs, and replanting. Camas plots were harvested by individuals or kin-groups, who were recognized as a particular plot&#x27;s cultivators or stewards. Stewardship was typically lineage-based, and cultivation rights to a particular plot were fiercely guarded. Multiple generations would often harvest the same Camas plot. Plots have been recorded as possessing physical boundary markers, and there were social consequences for harvesting from a plot that was recognized as being maintained by a particular individual or kin-group. The camas bulbs were harvested with a pointed wooden tool, with the work of cultivation being done primarily by women.

===Food use===
&quot;Camassia&quot; species were an important food staple for Indigenous peoples and settlers in parts of the American Old West.
While &quot;Camassia&quot; species are edible and nutritious, the white-flowered deathcamas species (which are not in the genus &quot;Camassia&quot; but in a number of genera in the tribe Melanthieae) that grow in the same areas are toxic, and the bulbs are quite similar in appearance. It is easiest to tell the plants apart when they are in flower.

The quamash was a food source for many indigenous peoples in western North America. Blue camas was harvested when in bloom, in spring or early summer. After being harvested the bulbs were pit-roasted or boiled. A pit-cooked camas bulb can take up to two days to fully cook. The look and taste is something like baked sweet potato, but sweeter, and with more crystalline fibers due to the presence of inulin in the bulbs. The eating of too many such baked bulbs – especially if undercooked – can cause excessive flatulence, due to their containing inulin and other oligosaccharides. After cooking, the bulbs could be pounded into a paste and made into cakes.

Native American peoples who ate camas include the Nez Perce (Nimíipuu), Cree, Kalapuya, Blackfoot, Yakama, and Coast Salish, including the Lekwungen or Songhees who collected camas in what is now Victoria, British Columbia, the Lekwungen name for which was Camosun, or &quot;place to gather camas&quot;. The Kutenai called the camas &quot;xapi&quot; (Ktunaxa). Camas bulbs contributed to the survival of members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In the Great Basin, expanded settlement by whites accompanied by turning cattle and hogs onto camas prairies greatly diminished food available to native tribes and increased tension between Native Americans and settlers and travelers. Though the once-immense spreads of camas lands have diminished because of modern developments and agriculture, numerous camas prairies and marshes may still be seen today.

===Ornamental use===
This bulb flower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

==Place names==
Many areas in the Pacific Northwest are named for the plant, including Camas Valley, Oregon; the city of Camas, Washington; Lacamas Creek in southern Washington; the Camas Prairie in northern Idaho (and its Camas Prairie Railroad); Camas County in southern Idaho; and Kamas, Utah.

== Role in indigenous trade and culture ==
Camas was an important component of the diets of most indigenous groups located in the Pacific Northwest. However, not all indigenous groups harvested camas themselves. Instead, many relied on trade in order to procure it. Indigenous groups that lived in environments that suited camas production, such as the Coast Salish, developed networks of exchange in order to procure a variety of goods and foods, such as cedar bark baskets and dried halibut.

In North American Indigenous cultures, trade had economic as well as diplomatic functions, with ceremonies such as the potlatch serving as a means to legitimize an individual&#x27;s rule and establish their status as a provider. Camas was frequently traded in large volumes for such occasions.

== Theories of anthropogenic dispersal ==
As indigenous land-management techniques have been theorized as having had a significant impact on the maintenance of the Garry oak ecosystem, one of the primary ecosystems in which &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; grows, researchers have investigated the potentiality of anthropogenic transport through an investigation of the genetic structure of &quot;Camassia quamash&quot;. Despite historical evidence for anthropogenic maintenance of camas plots and transportation through Indigenous trade networks, analysis of the genetic structures of &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; have not substantiated theories of anthropogenic dispersal. The distribution of &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; across the Pacific Northwest is most likely the result of postglacial migration. These results imply that the degree of anthropogenic dispersal of &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; that occurred was not of such a scale as to leave a marker in the plant&#x27;s genetic structure.

<doc id="869379" wikidata="Q4729073" url="?curid=869379" title="All Metal Products Company">
<text>All Metal Products Company was an American toy company founded in 1920 and based in Wyandotte, Michigan for most of its history. It produced inexpensive pressed metal toys under the Wyandotte brand name, and was the largest manufacturer of toy guns in the US for several decades in the 20th century. The company&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Wyandotte Toys are Good and Safe.&quot; To keep costs down, the company used scrap and surplus raw materials whenever possible, often manufacturing their toys from scrap metal obtained from local auto factories.

==History==

Initially, All Metal Products Company specialized in toy guns, including pop guns, water pistols, and air rifles. Their slogan in the 1920s was &quot;Every Boy Wants a Pop Gun.&quot; By 1927 they had become the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of toy guns. Wyandotte Toys stopped manufacturing air rifles in 1929, but continued to dominate the toy gun market throughout the remainder of their history by producing pop guns, clicker pistols, dart guns and pistols, cap guns and a variety of plastic pistols. In 1929 the company added girls&#x27; toys and toy vehicles, as well as lithographed novelty toys in 1936. Metal toys were banned during World War II because the metals were needed for the war effort. The company survived by producing wooden toys and die-cut cardboard &quot;build your own&quot; play sets during the war. All Metal Products also manufactured en bloc clips for the M1 Garand rifle. Clips of this nature will be stamped with &quot;AMP1&quot; on the rear of the clip.

In 1948, die cast and plastic toys were added to the Wyandotte line, allowing it to compete with other companies who sold inexpensive dime store-type toys at lower prices than the Wyandotte pressed metal toys. In 1946, All Metal Products Company bought the Hafner Manufacturing Company, the maker of &quot;Hafner Clockwork&quot; pressed metal toy trains.

In the early 1950s, All Metal Products Company moved from its site on Sycamore and 14th St. in Wyandotte to Ohio, hoping that closer proximity to Ohio&#x27;s steel mills and cheaper Ohio labor would help the company cut costs. The effort was not enough to prevent All Metal Products Company from going bankrupt in 1956, resulting in the sale of part of its product line, including the former Hafner trains, to competitor Louis Marx and Company. What remained of the company attempted a comeback in 1957 but failed.

<doc id="869383" wikidata="Q1931971" url="?curid=869383" title="Republic (album)">
<text>Republic (stylised as Republic©) is the sixth studio album by the English rock band New Order. It was first released on 3 May 1993 in the United Kingdom by CentreDate Co Ltd in association with London Records and on 11 May 1993 in the United States by Qwest and Warner Bros. Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album following the demise of their former label Factory Records, and would be their last studio album for eight years until 2001&#x27;s &quot;Get Ready&quot;.

&quot;Republic&quot; became New Order&#x27;s second consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart, and was nominated for the 1993 Mercury Music Prize. In the United States, it reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest-peaking album on the chart to date. Its lead single &quot;Regret&quot; became New Order&#x27;s last top-five entry on the UK singles chart. The band went on hiatus following a gig at the Reading Festival in promotion of the album in August 1993. Lead singer Bernard Sumner was known to dislike travelling to North America, and media reports suggested that the pressure of the long leg there contributed to the band&#x27;s temporary demise, although they reunited in 1998.

== Background ==
According to bassist Peter Hook, the band were forced to make the album in order to save The Haçienda, a Manchester club partially owned by the band that was losing a great deal of money. The band were also told that if they did not produce another album, Factory Records would go bankrupt and the band members, who had guaranteed loans for Factory and the club, would be ruined financially.

At the same time, Hook and Bernard Sumner were &quot;at that point in the relationship where you hate each others&#x27; stinking guts,&quot; and the band members were &quot;all off our heads on various things,&quot; which made for a stressful working environment. While Bernard Sumner was off recording with Electronic, Hook, Morris and Gilbert wrote a whole instrumental album that would be shelved at the request of Sumner when he came back . Disputes over the music and publishing rights created further acrimony that caused the band to break up, though they reunited in 1998 and recorded two more studio albums before Hook departed with what threatens to be everlasting endurance.

==Artwork==
As with previous New Order releases, &quot;Republic&quot;&#x27;s artwork was designed by Peter Saville and no text other than credits appears within the sleeve. Saville, who had relocated to California, depicted different aspects of the state—people relaxing on the beach while houses burn (a reference to frequent wildfires or the 1992 Los Angeles riots) and vast natural landscapes contrasting with the skyline of Los Angeles. Most of the images were taken from stock photo libraries to achieve a commercial look, and were heavily retouched. Several of these images have been used elsewhere, such as direct-mail campaigns, catalogues and adverts for businesses. Another interpretation of the album&#x27;s artwork alludes to the Fall of Rome.

===&quot;Republic: The Limited Run..&quot;===
A limited-edition version of &quot;Republic&quot;, titled &quot;Republic: The Limited Run..&quot;, was released in the United States. Although the tracks are the same as on the standard release, the packaging is entirely different. Instead of including a jewel case, the CD is packaged in a folding wallet made of bright orange vinyl underpadded with soft foam, giving it the feel of an inner tube. The CD&#x27;s label is also redesigned, with no words but with a picture of several orange rubber inner tubes against a background of flames, a reference to the cover artwork. The booklet, tucked into a pocket of the vinyl wallet, is the same as with the standard version, but is made of a plastic waterproof material instead of paper.

<text>Roosevelt Island is the second largest ice rise of Antarctica and world-wide, after Berkner Island. Despite its name, it is not an island, since the bedrock below the ice at its highest part is below sea level. It is about long in a NW-SE direction, wide and about in area, lying under the eastern part of the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. Its central ridge rises to about above sea level, but this and all other elevations of the ice rise are completely covered by ice, so that it is invisible at ground level.

Examination of how the ice flows above it establishes the existence and extent of the ice rise. 
 Radar surveying carried out between 1995 and 2013 showed that the Raymond Effect was operating beneath the ice divide.
The ice rise has become a focus of the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) research
 using ice coring.

Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd named it in 1934 after US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Byrd was the leader of the expedition that discovered the ice rise. Roosevelt Island lies within the boundaries of the Ross Dependency, New Zealand&#x27;s Antarctic claim.

<doc id="869389" wikidata="Q1153251" url="?curid=869389" title="Veluwe">
<text>The Veluwe () is a forest-rich ridge of hills (1100 km2; 420 sq. mi.) in the province of Gelderland in the Netherlands. The Veluwe features many different landscapes, including woodland, heath, some small lakes and Europe&#x27;s largest sand drifts.

The Veluwe is the largest push moraine complex in the Netherlands, stretching 60 km (40 miles) from north to south, and reaching heights of up to 110 metres (360&#x27;). The Veluwe was formed by the Saalian glacial during the Pleistocene epoch, some 200,000 years ago. Glaciers some 200 metres (600&#x27;) thick pushed the sand deposits in the Rhine and Maas Delta sideways, creating the hills which now form most of the Veluwe. Because the hills are made of sand, rain water disappears rapidly, and then it flows at a depth of tens of metres (yards) to the edges where it reaches the surface again.

Originally the Veluwe was surrounded by a string of swamps, heavily populated with game such as deer and wild boar because these areas offered rich vegetation to feed on. Since the 1990s many plans are underway, or have already been implemented, to restore these wetlands by blocking the drainage systems built by farmers during the last 150 years. This results in very dry heathland changing into wetland within a span of just a few hundred metres (yards). The Wisselse Veen near the village of Epe, on the northeastern Veluwe, offers a good example of this.

== Etymology ==
Veluwe derives from Proto-Germanic *&quot;falwaz&quot; (pale, fallow) and *&quot;awjō&quot; (island). The name corresponds to &quot;fallow lands&quot; in English and probably was used in opposition to the fertile &quot;good lands&quot; of the Betuwe (from *&quot;bataz&quot;, good, and *&quot;awjō&quot;, island) to the south.

== Geography ==
There are 21 municipalities in the Veluwe region: Apeldoorn, Arnhem, Barneveld, Brummen, Ede, Elburg, Epe, Ermelo, Harderwijk, Hattem, Heerde, Nijkerk, Nunspeet, Oldebroek, Putten, Renkum, Rheden, Rozendaal, Scherpenzeel, Voorst and Wageningen.

The sparsely populated, infertile Veluwe acts as the traditional linguistic boundary between Low Franconian dialects (i.e. essentially Dutch and closely related dialects) to the west and south and Low Saxon dialects further north and east.

== Flora and fauna ==
There are both coniferous and deciduous forests on the Veluwe, and some 500 different plant species can be found. The region is also home to many different species of animals, such as wild boar, several species of deer (like the roe deer, red deer and fallow deer), several species of snakes (including the common viper), pine martens, foxes, and badgers. Furthermore, the bird raven was successfully reintroduced, and the introduced Reeves&#x27;s muntjac and mouflon can sometimes be seen. Furthermore, there live semi-wild and wild cattle and horses like both semi-wild and wild Highland cattle in multiple areas of the Veluwe, semi-wild Sayaguesa cattle and two semi-wild horse breeds: New-forest pony and Icelandic pony. Since 2019 the wolf is officially back with a female and male pair in the northern Veluwe (spring 2019) who had their offspring in the summer of 2019 and one female wolf in middle Veluwe. The prognosis are that many more wolves will reclaim the area. The European bison is also reintroduced as pilot in a fenced area in the Radio Kootwijk Reserve and the golden jackal is reaching the area, from which they are not native, but since the jackals reach the area all by their own they are seen as a welcome and new native species.

==Developments==
Parts of the Veluwe that have been separated from each other by roads, towns and farmland are being reconnected by returning farmland to nature and creating wildlife crossings over highways. In 2012, nine of these overpasses had been built, each one about 50 metres (200&#x27;) wide and covered with sand and vegetation to encourage animals to use it. Wildlife corridors connecting the Veluwe to other wildlife areas such as the Oostvaardersplassen in the Netherlands are being developed and further connections to Germany are an option. It is hoped that by doing so the genetic diversity of the wildlife population will increase.

In order to turn the entire Veluwe into one IUCN (Category II) standard National Park a number of actions have been taken, or are planned, including: bungalow parks located in a more sensitive natural area have been removed; taking down remaining fences, as around De Hoge Veluwe; an old industrial zone near the village of Renkum was cleared away because it blocked a valley that was important for the migration of wildlife; and a military complex near Nunspeet was removed instead of being redeveloped as a business area.

==Tourism and recreation==
The Veluwe is a tourist destination, especially for Dutch people wanting to go on a short vacation in their own country. Campsites and bungalow parks are the preferred place to stay for most visitors. There are more than 500 of these sites, most located on the outskirts of the natural area.

Tourist attractions in the area include four zoos, over 50 museums including the Kröller-Müller art museum, and the royal palace Het Loo at Apeldoorn. The National Sports Centre Papendal, a large sports complex and Olympic Games training facility, is located in the south of the Veluwe near Arnhem.

<doc id="869391" wikidata="Q929499" url="?curid=869391" title="William Fairbairn">
<text>Sir William Fairbairn, 1st Baronet of Ardwick (19 February 1789 – 18 August 1874) was a Scottish civil engineer, structural engineer and shipbuilder. In 1854 he succeeded George Stephenson and Robert Stephenson to become the third president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

==Early career==
Born in Kelso to a local farmer, Fairbairn showed an early mechanical aptitude and served as an apprentice millwright in Newcastle upon Tyne where he befriended the young George Stephenson. He moved to Manchester in 1813 to work for Adam Parkinson and Thomas Hewes. In 1817, he launched his mill-machinery business with James Lillie as Fairbairn and Lillie Engine Makers.

==Structural studies==

Fairbairn was a lifelong learner and joined the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1830. In the 1820s and 30s, he and Eaton Hodgkinson conducted a search for an optimal cross section for iron beams. They designed, for example, the bridge over Water Street for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830. In the 1840s, when Robert Stephenson, the son of his youthful friend George, was trying to develop a way of crossing the Menai Strait, he retained both Fairbairn and Hodgkinson as consultants. It was Fairbairn who conceived the idea of a rectangular tube or box girder to bridge the large gap between Anglesey and North Wales. He conducted many tests on prototypes in his Millwall shipyard and at the site of the bridge, showing how such a tube should be constructed. The design was first used in a shorter span at Conway, and followed by the much larger Britannia Bridge. The tube bridge ultimately proved far too costly a concept for widespread use owing to the sheer mass and cost of wrought iron needed. Fairbairn himself developed wrought iron trough bridges which used some of the ideas he had developed in the tubular bridge.

==Shipbuilding==
When the cotton industry fell into recession, Fairbairn diversified into the manufacture of boilers for locomotives and into shipbuilding. Perceiving a ship as a floating tubular beam, he criticised existing design standards dictated by Lloyd&#x27;s of London.

Fairbairn and Lillie built the iron paddle-steamer at Manchester in 1830. The difficulties which were encountered in the construction of iron ships in an inland town like Manchester led to the removal of this branch of the business to Millwall, London in 1834–35. Here Fairbairn constructed over eighty vessels, including &quot;Pottinger&quot; of 1,250 tons, for the Peninsular and Oriental Company; and other vessels for the British Government, and many others, introducing iron shipbuilding on the River Thames. In 1848 he retired from this branch of his business.

Fairbairn drew on his experience with the construction of iron-hulled ships when designing the Britannia Bridge and Conwy Railway Bridges.

==Railway locomotives==

Fairbairn began building railway locomotives in 1839 with an 0-4-0 design for the Manchester and Bolton Railway. By 1862 the company had constructed more than 400 at Millwall for companies such as the Great Western Railway and the London and North Western Railway. However, as the works had no rail access, any locomotives had to be shipped by road.

==Boilers==
Fairbairn developed the &quot;Lancashire boiler&quot; in 1844. In 1861, at the request of the UK Parliament, he conducted early research into metal fatigue, raising and lowering a 3 tonne mass onto a wrought iron cylinder 3,000,000 times before it fractured and showing that a static load of 12 tonne was needed for such an effect.

He experimented with glass cylinders and was able to show that the hoop stress in the wall was twice the longitudinal stress. When a cylindrical boiler failed, it usually fractured along its length owing to the high hoop stress in the wall.

This knowledge of how hoop stress increased with diameter, and how stresses were independent of drum length led to his invention of the Fairbairn-Beeley and his five-tube boilers, where a single large diameter shell was replaced by multiple smaller, and less stressed, shells. Eventually this would lead to the near-universal adoption of water-tube boilers with small tubes for high pressures, replacing the older fire-tube designs.

==Investigations==

Fairbairn was one of the first engineers to conduct systematic investigations of failures of structures, including the collapse of textile mills and boiler explosions. His report on the collapse of a mill at Oldham showed the poor design methods used by architects when specifying cast iron girders for supporting heavily loaded floors, for example. In another report, he condemned the use of trussed cast iron girders, and advised Robert Stephenson not to use the concept in a bridge then being built over the river Dee at Chester in 1846. The bridge collapsed in May 1847, killing 5 people who were passengers on the local train passing over the structure at the time. The Dee Bridge disaster raised concerns about the integrity of many other railway bridges already built or about to be built on the rail network.

Fairbairn conducted some of the first serious studies of the effects of repeated loading of wrought and cast iron girders, showing that fracture could occur by crack growth from incipient defects, a problem now known as fatigue. He built large-scale testing apparatus for the studies, and was partly funded by the Board of Trade.

He also conducted experiments on pressurized cylinders of glass and was able to show that the highest stress in the wall occurs around the diameter. It is known as the hoop stress and is twice the value of the longitudinal stress which occurs along the length of the cylinder. The precise value depends only on the wall thickness and the internal pressure. His work was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society and was of great help in analysing failures in steam boilers and pipes. In 1854 he founded the Manchester Steam Users&#x27; Association, which quickly became recognised as setting national standards for high-pressure steam boilers. As the &quot;Associated Offices Technical Committee&quot; of British insurers the MSUA remains a national certification authority.

<text>Timo Antero Kotipelto (born 15 March 1969) is a Finnish musician best known as the lead singer of the power metal band Stratovarius, whom he joined in 1994, as well as fronting his own band Kotipelto.

==Biography==

He studied vocals at the pop/jazz conservatory in Helsinki, briefly singing for an amateur cover band named Filthy Asses. In summer of 1994, he applied to Stratovarius, who were looking for a singer at the time, and was accepted. His arrival corresponds closely with the band&#x27;s rise to international fame. The first album he recorded with the band was &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot;, in 1995. Stratovarius has then become a top name in the European heavy metal scene, recording seven more albums and performing in numerous notable rock festivals.

In late 2003, Kotipelto split from Stratovarius after intra-band disagreements, notably with guitarist Timo Tolkki. After much turmoil throughout 2004, he rejoined the band in January 2005, recorded the album &quot;Stratovarius&quot;, and performed live on tour that covered North America, South America, Europe and Asia. In 2008, Timo Tolkki made public that he and Timo Kotipelto had arguments but Kotipelto never really left the band and the announcement that he left was part of a big publicity stunt.

In 2002 Kotipelto started his solo project, called Kotipelto. So far he has released three albums: &quot;Waiting For The Dawn&quot;, &quot;Coldness&quot; and the last one, released 20 April 2007, &quot;Serenity&quot;. 
Aside from Stratovarius and Kotipelto, Timo Kotipelto has also provided additional vocals to Sonata Arctica&#x27;s Silence album along with lead vocals with his close friend, ex-Sonata Arctica guitarist Jani Liimatainen and his band Cain&#x27;s Offering. and lead vocals for the song &quot;Out of the White Hole&quot;, on Ayreon&#x27;s 2000 release Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator.

Kotipelto also provided vocals for the track &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; on Warmen&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Japanese Hospitality&quot;.

<text>Timo Tapio Tolkki (born 3 March 1966) is a Finnish musician best known as the former guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer of the power metal band Stratovarius. With his tenure lasting for more than twenty years, he was the longest standing member of the band before his departure in 2008. After leaving Stratovarius he formed two supergroups named Revolution Renaissance and Symfonia, both of which have since disbanded. In a 2011 article by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, Tolkki was included in the all-time top 50 list of the world&#x27;s fastest guitarists.

== Early years and Stratovarius ==
Tolkki started playing guitar at the age of seven and practiced intensely, sometimes eight hours a day. When he was twelve years old, his father committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of his apartment.

Before joining Stratovarius in 1984, Tolkki had played with the bands Antidote, Thunder and Road Block. At the beginning of his career with Stratovarius, he served as vocalist as well as handling all lead and rhythm guitars, and at times bass guitar (until Jari Kainulainen&#x27;s arrival in 1993). After the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Dreamspace&quot; (1994), Tolkki handed over vocal duties to Timo Kotipelto, who took over from &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot; (1995) onwards. This was largely due to Tolkki&#x27;s desire to evolve the overall musical direction of the band and concentrate on his guitar work. Further changes were made after &quot;Dreamspace&quot;, including the departure of the remaining original members of the band, keyboardist Antti Ikonen and drummer Tuomo Lassila, due to creative differences.

In 1994, Tolkki released his first solo album, &quot;Classical Variations and Themes&quot;, which had at the time been one of his longtime ambitions. The album was similar to his work with Stratovarius, but with more focus on primarily instrumental compositions. His second solo album, &quot;Hymn to Life&quot; (2002) showed a more personal side, dealing with such emotional issues as his relationship with God and his late father.

He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2004, following a nervous breakdown which occurred some months after Stratovarius acrimoniously disbanded. After a period of rehabilitation, he went on to make a full recovery later that year and subsequently opened his own recording studio named Goldenworks. A final self-titled album with Stratovarius was released in 2005, after which he announced his departure from the band in 2008. Upon leaving he decided to waive the legal rights to the name. He later claimed this was done as a protest due to the remaining members deciding to continue the band as Stratovarius.

== Solo projects ==
=== Revolution Renaissance ===

Tolkki&#x27;s next project was an album described as a rock opera, named &quot;Saana – Warrior of Light Pt 1&quot;. Released on 14 March 2008, it featured a number of guest vocalists, including soprano Jennifer Sowle in the lead role, as well as Heikki Pöyhiä of Twilightning. Also in 2008, he founded a band called Revolution Renaissance, which released three albums between 2008 and 2010.

=== Symfonia ===
In 2010, Symfonia was formed as a power metal supergroup comprising Tolkki, singer André Matos, keyboardist Mikko Härkin, drummer Uli Kusch and former Stratovarius bandmate Jari Kainulainen. They made their debut performance at the 2011 Finnish Metal Expo and later released their only studio album, &quot;In Paradisum&quot;, but in December of that year Tolkki announced the discontinuation of the band, and subsequently his retirement from the music industry.

In March 2012, Tolkki stated on his Facebook profile (and official Symfonia page) that although he had left the music business, he hadn&#x27;t given up on music altogether: &quot;With all the tools available for us today to release music, you will hear something interesting from me&quot;. Later he released a mock album cover entitled &quot;Classical Variations and Themes Vol 2&quot;, suggesting a new solo album. On 10 April 2012 he released a new instrumental track named &quot;Dinner with Paganini&quot;, which was made available as a free download through PledgeMusic, as well as a revised name for a potential new album, &quot;Classical Variations and Themes II: Credo&quot;. However, on 26 July, he announced the cancellation of the project.

=== Avalon Metal Opera ===

On 8 January 2013, Tolkki announced the opening of a new mixing and mastering studio named Studiotolkki, located in Helsinki, Finland.

In February 2013, Timo announced his new project, Avalon, featuring a group of guest musicians such as Michael Kiske (Unisonic, Helloween), Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation), Elize Ryd (Amaranthe), Russell Allen (Symphony X, Adrenaline Mob, Star One), Rob Rock (Impellitteri, M.A.R.S.), Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica), Jens Johansson (Stratovarius, Yngwie Malmsteen), Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater) and Alex Holzwarth (Rhapsody of Fire). The album, released on 17 May 2013, follows a story set in a post-apocalyptic future. In 2055, Earth has been almost destroyed by natural catastrophes, and a small group of survivors decide to set off a journey to find a sacred place known as The Land of New Hope.

In October 2013 Timo launched a news website for the project in which he announced the sequel to &quot;The Land of New Hope&quot;, which was provisionally titled &quot;Avalon II&quot;. The cast of guest musicians will be revealed one by one. Simone Simons of Epica fame is the first confirmed singer. Floor Jansen will play the leading role. It was also announced that Timo&#x27;s former bandmates in Stratovarius, drummer Tuomo Lassila and keyboardist Antti Ikonen will play on this album.

A European tour was planned for May 2014, coinciding with the release of the album.

On 28 January, Timo revealed title of the album (&quot;Angels of the Apocalypse&quot;) and the rest of the cast: Fabio Lione (Rhapsody of Fire, Angra), David DeFeis (Virgin Steele), Elize Ryd (Amaranthe) and Caterina Nix. Timo also announced that there will be a contest for guitar and keyboard players, with the winners getting a chance to perform a solo with him in one of the songs.

In June 2019, Timo Tolkki released the third part of the &quot;Avalon&quot; trilogy, the album &quot;Return to Eden&quot;, with the main working song, &quot;Promises&quot;.

In 2021, Timo Tolkki releases his new solo album with &quot;Infinite Visions&quot; project&#x27;s songs, called &quot;Union Magnetica&quot;, as the fourth Avalon album, which is called &quot;The Enigma Birth&quot;, with many musicians as guests. The new metal opera album has the main working songs &quot;Master of Hell&quot; and &quot;The Fire and the Sinner&quot;.

=== Allen/Lande ===
On 24 July 2013, Tolkki announced via his Facebook page (among a statement regarding Stratovarius) that he would be the producer, mixer and songwriter for a new album of the duo Allen/Lande, composed of Symphony X vocalist Russell Allen and Norwegian singer Jørn Lande. The album &quot;The Great Divide&quot; was released on 17 October in Europe and 21 October 2014 in North America.

=== Chaos Magic ===
In May 2015, it was announced that Timo would produce and perform in a project with Chilean singer Caterina Nix titled Chaos Magic. Caterina and Timo met in Chile when Stratovarius was performing there. She would later guest sing in Avalon&#x27;s second album, &quot;Angels of the Apocalypse&quot;. Their first, self-titled album is set for a 3 July release in Europe. In June 2015 they released their first videos: a video for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, and two lyric videos for &quot;One Drop of Blood&quot; and &quot;A Little Too Late&quot;.

== Playing style ==
From the period spanning Stratovarius&#x27; first three albums, Tolkki&#x27;s guitar playing was more progressive and heavy. During this time he preferred E tuning, with his compositions often bearing a dark and unnerving tonal quality (particularly on &quot;Dreamspace&quot;). Following Timo Kotipelto&#x27;s arrival as lead singer, Tolkki&#x27;s style shifted gradually more towards the traditionally speedy and melodic format of power metal, with an emphasis on such elements as neoclassical phrasing and fast alternate picking.

== Personal life ==
Tolkki has been married three times. He has one daughter from his second marriage, born in 1988. Since 2000, Tolkki has been in a relationship with Dominika Gottová, eldest daughter of Czech singer Karel Gott. They got married in 2010. Gottová filed for divorce in December 2019, but the proceedings were halted in November 2020 after the couple decided to reconcile.

In November 2023, Tolkki was convicted by the Helsinki District Court for fraudulently claiming income support in 2020. He received a 45-day suspended prison sentence and was ordered to pay €3,063 to Kela.

<text>The Royal Castle in Warsaw ( ) is a state museum and a national historical monument, which formerly served as the official royal residence of several Polish monarchs. The personal offices of the king and the administrative offices of the royal court were located in the Castle from the 16th century until the final partition of Poland in 1795. Situated in the Castle Square, at the entrance to the Old Town, the Royal Castle holds a significant collection of Polish and European art.

The Royal Castle witnessed many notable events in Poland&#x27;s history; the Constitution of 3 May 1791, first of its type in Europe and the world&#x27;s second-oldest codified national constitution, was drafted here by the Four-Year Parliament. The edifice was redesigned into a neoclassical style following the partitions of Poland. Under the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939), it was the seat of the Polish head of state and president. The Second World War brought complete destruction to the building; in September 1939 it was targeted and ignited by Luftwaffe fighter aircraft, and then detonated by the Nazis after the failed Warsaw Uprising in 1944. 

In 1965, the surviving wall fragments, cellars, the adjacent Copper-Roof Palace and the Kubicki Arcades were registered as historical monuments. Reconstruction was carried out in the years 1971–1984, during which it regained its original 17th-century appearance. In 1980, the Royal Castle and surrounding Old Town became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the second most visited art museum in Poland (after the Wawel Castle in Kraków) and the 25th most visited art museum in the world with over 2.02 million visitors in 2023.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
The history of the castle dates back to the 14th century when the first Castle Tower was constructed, and the fortified complex was initially used as the residence of the Masovian dukes. In the early 1600s, it was designated to replace Wawel Castle in Kraków as the seat of the king, Parliament (Chamber of Deputies and Senate), and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The medieval Gothic structure was remodeled into Italian mannerism by architects Matteo Castelli and Giovanni Battista Trevano. The Baroque easternmost wing was designed by Gaetano Chiaveri and completed in 1747.

=== Castle in the Middle Ages ===
In 1339, the Papal Legate in Warsaw heard a case brought by the King of Poland, Casimir III the Great, against the German Teutonic Order. He claimed that they had illegally seized a slice of Polish territory — the Pomerania and Kuyavia regions. The documents in this case are the earliest written testimony to the existence of Warsaw. At that time a fortified town surrounded by earthen and wooden ramparts, and situated where the Royal Castle now stands, it was the seat of Trojden, duke of Masovia. At the end of the 13th century, during the Duke Conrad&#x27;s rule, the wooden-earthen gord called &quot;Small Manor&quot; () was erected. The next duke, Casimir I, decided to build the Great Tower (), possibly one of the first brick building in Warsaw.

In the middle of the 14th century, the Castle Tower was built, and its remains up to the first storey have survived to this day. During the reign over Masovia by Duke Janusz I the Elder, the &quot;Curia Maior&quot; (Big Manor) was erected between 1407 and 1410. Its façade, which was still standing in 1944, was knocked down by the Germans, but has been rebuilt since then. The character of the new residence and its size (47.5 m/14.5 m) decided the change of the buildings status, and from 1414, it functioned as a Prince Manor.

=== Renaissance period ===
When the Duchy of Masovia was incorporated in the Kingdom of Poland in 1526, the edifice, which until then had been the Castle of the Dukes of Masovia, became one of the royal residences. From 1548 onwards Queen Bona Sforza resided in it with her daughters Izabela, who became Queen of Hungary, Catherine, later to become Queen of Sweden, and Anna Jagiellon, later Queen of Poland. In 1556–1557 and in 1564, the King of Poland, Sigismund II Augustus, convened royal parliaments in Warsaw. They met in the castle. Following the Lublin Union (1569), by which the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania – were united as a single country, Warsaw Castle was regularly the place where the parliament of the Two-Nations State met. In 1569–1572, King Sigismund II Augustus started alterations in the castle, the architects being Giovanni Battista di Quadro and Giacopo Pario.

The &quot;Curia Maior&quot; was altered so as provide a meeting place for the Parliament, with premises for the Chamber of Deputies (&quot;Sejm&quot; – delegates of the gentry) on the ground floor (&quot;the Old Chamber of Deputies&quot;), and the Senate Chamber (where the Senators debated in the presence of the King) on the first floor. This was one of the first attempts in Europe to create a building that would be used solely for parliamentary purposes. The parliamentary character of the &quot;Curia Maior&quot; is stressed by the paintings of the facade – the coats-of-arms of Poland, of Lithuania, and of the various regions from which the delegates were elected. A new Renaissance style building, known as the &quot;Royal House&quot;, was erected next to the &quot;Curia Maior&quot;. The king resided there when the parliament was in session.

=== Vasa period and the Deluge ===


The next alterations to the castle were made in the reign of Sigismund III Vasa, who transferred the royal residence from Kraków to Warsaw. In 1598–1619, the castle was enlarged. Giovanni Trevano was in charge of the reconstruction. His plans were probably amended by the Venetian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi.

Between 1601 and 1603, Giacomo Rodondo finished the new northern wing. From 1602 Paolo del Corte was doing stonework. Later after 1614, when Matteo Castelli took the lead, the western wing was built (from today&#x27;s Plac Zamkowy side) as chancelleries and a marshals office. The southern wing was built at the end. In that way, five-wings in a mannerist-early baroque style were built. In 1619, the New Royal Tower (), also called Sigismund&#x27;s Tower, was finished. It was 60 meters high and was placed in the middle of a newly built west castle 90 meters in length. At the top of the tower, a clock with gilded hands and copper face was placed. The new tower&#x27;s spire was 13 meters high and had glided knobs and a copper flag at the top.

On 29 October 1611 in the Senator&#x27;s Chamber, Tsar Vasili IV of Russia, who had been captured by the hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, paid homage to the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa.

Sigismund III and his successors of the Vasa dynasty — Władysław IV Vasa and John II Casimir Vasa — collected many rich works of art in the castle, such as oriental fabrics, tapestries, and numerous paintings by such famous artists as Titian, Veronese, Jacopo and Leandro Bassano, Tintoretto, Palma il Giovane, Antonio Vassilacchi, Tommaso Dolabella, Guercino, Guido Reni, Joseph Heintz the Elder, Bartholomeus Spranger, Roelant Savery, Rembrandt, Pieter Soutman, Peter Danckerts de Rij, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Daniel Seghers, Georg Daniel Schultz and sculptures by Giambologna, Giovanni Francesco Susini and Adriaen de Vries. These splendid works of art were either destroyed or plundered during the invasions of Poland by Sweden and Russia during the Deluge, in 1655–1657. The Swedes took all the priceless pictures, furniture, tapestries, the royal library, the crown archive, numerous sculptures, whole floors and royal flags. In the castle they had a military &quot;Lazareth&quot; field hospital, which additionally contributed to the devastation of the buildings. A few months later armies destroyed the rest, plundering most of the copper elements and tearing up the rest of castle&#x27;s floor.

The majority of the preserved castle furnishings from the Vasa period found their place in the collection of the Visitationist Monastery in Warsaw as donations from the last Vasa, John II Casimir and his French-born wife Marie Louise Gonzaga.

In 1628, the first Polish opera – &quot;Galatea&quot;, was staged at the Castle. The great opera hall (double-storied, over 50 m long), which existed at the Royal Castle, was demolished by Swedes and Germans and rebuilt in the 1660s by King John II Casimir.

=== Late Baroque period ===

In 1657, the reconstruction of the castle started, under the Italian architect Izydor Affait&#x27;s guidance. Because of the lack of money, the following Polish king, Michael I Korybut did not decide on radical rebuilding, just limiting himself to rebuilding destroyed buildings. Because of the bad conditions of the residence, he had to move to Ujazdów Castle in 1669. Until 1696, when the next Polish king, John III Sobieski, died, no serious works were done. They only limited work to current inspections of the building&#x27;s condition. Sessions of Parliament continued to be held in the castle, as well as various State occasions, such as when the Hohenzollern dukes of Prussia paid homage to the kings of Poland and occasions when the king received the ambassadors of foreign countries.

After choosing Augustus II in an election in 1697, the castle again began to deteriorate. A new conflict with Charles XII of Sweden significantly limited the king&#x27;s budget. Despite problems, in 1698 Augustus II commissioned a residence reconstruction project. In 1700 it was done by Johann Friedrich Karcher, who came from abroad. On 25 May 1702 the Swedes re-seized the Royal Castle in Warsaw, creating a hospital with 500 beds, and into the Chamber of Deputies and ministers&#x27; rooms, they placed a stable. During the Polish army&#x27;s siege in 1704 the castle was retaken. However, it was soon retaken once more by Sweden&#x27;s army. In 1707, by virtue of the peace treaty between Augustus II and Charles XII of Sweden, Russian allied troops entered Warsaw, and Tsar Peter I of Russia settled in the castle. After two months, Russian forces were removed from Warsaw, taking with them works of art from the castle, including Tommaso Dolabella&#x27;s pictures, which included two that were very important for Russians: &quot;The Defense of Smolensk&quot; and &quot;Russian Tsar Vasili IV compelled to kneel before Polish King Sigismund III of Poland&quot;. Władysław IV&#x27;s Opera Hall was completely devastated and was never restored.

The reconstruction according to Karcher&#x27;s plans began from 1713 to 1715. In 1717 the Parliament Hall was completely rebuilt. It was used to serve the Saxon rulers as a coronation hall. During the following years, between 1722 and 1723, the other castle halls were converted-under the direction of architect Joachim Daniel von Jauch, the new Senate Chamber was built, and all the furnishings moved from the old to the new location, including among others: 60 Polish provincial emblems, panelling, mouldings and &quot;lesene&quot;. On 31 May 1732, a fire broke out in the castle destroying the west elevation and part of the Sigismund&#x27;s Tower and the exterior façade sculptures, known as armature.

The next reconstruction project of the Royal Castle appeared after Augustus III was elected to the Polish throne in 1733. New plans, which were formed in 1734 and developed in 1737 by architect Gaetano Chiaveri, saw among other things, the reconstruction of the castle&#x27;s façade on the Vistula side in the rococo style, which was meant to form a new so called Saxon elevation and also the conversion of the north-east part with the Altana Tower, where it was planned for 3 two-storey avant-corps (risalto) to be built on. The reconstruction work according to these plans was carried out with various intensity between 1740 and 1752. During the period of 1740–1747, the façade on the Vistula side was reconstructed in the late baroque style (architects: Gaetano Chiaveri, Carl Friedrich Pöppelmann, Jan Krzysztof Knöffel). One of the best sculptors who did work on the castle in this period was Jan Jerzy Plersch, who made the royal decorative frames, mouldings and statues called the Famous Figures, which held the royal crowns on the top of the middle risalto, of the Saxon elevation, on the Vistula side. The last reconstruction work of this period was finished by late 1763, after the death of Augustus III, when Plersch made the last sculptures and frames with province emblems for the Parliament Hall.

=== Enlightenment period ===

The most splendid period in the history of the Castle was during the rule of Stanisław II Augustus (1764–1795).
This monarch collected exquisite works of art, many of which have survived to this day. He recruited first-rate architects such as Jakub Fontana, Domenico Merlini, Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer, and Jakub Kubicki, to work on the castle, as well as splendid painters such as Marcello Bacciarelli, Bernardo Bellotto, Franciszek Smuglewicz, Kazimierz Wojniakowski, and Jean-Baptiste Pillement and eminent sculptors such as André-Jean Lebrun and Jakub Monaldi, and famous French artists such as the architect Victor Louis. The total reconstruction of the castle planned by the King did not come to fruition, but the interior was changed to the neoclassical style – although this, known in Poland as the &quot;Stanisław Augustus style&quot;, was rather different from neoclassicism in the rest of Europe.


During 1766–1785 on the basis of Jakub Fontana&#x27;s plans, the southern wing of the castle, which was burnt on 15 December 1767 was rebuilt (2 destroyed floors, a new elevation on the south side with three avant-corps or risalti, the division of the façade by &quot;lesene&quot; and pilasters with Ionic capitals). Between 1774 and 1777, the monarch&#x27;s private apartments were furnished. They consisted of the Prospect Room (with landscapes by Canaletto), the chapel, the Audience Chamber, and the Bedchamber, while between 1779 and 1786 the Senate Apartments were completed, consisting of the Ballroom, the Knights Hall, the Throne Room, the Marble Room, and the Conference Chamber. These rooms contained pictures and sculptures depicting great events in Poland&#x27;s history, as well as portraits of Polish kings, generals, statesmen and scholars (including Copernicus and Adam Naruszewicz). In 1777, a gilded bronze altar presented to King Stanisław II Augustus by Pope Clement XIV, was installed in the new Chapel of the Royal Castle, so-called Saxon Chapel (today&#x27;s concert hall). The castle also housed the rich royal collections including 3200 pictures, classical statues, about 100 000 graphics, in addition to medals, coins, and a fine library, to house which a separate building was erected in 1780–1784. The new library building housed many books, gems, drawings, coins, maps and plans belonging to the monarch. The Royal Library&#x27;s book collection amounted to 16 000 volumes of various works, 25,525 drawings, 44,842 etchings in 726 bound volumes, overall a number of 70,000 etchings—fancy dress balls were also held in this hall.

Up until 1786 Stanisław II Augustus tried a few times to change the outside decor of the castle and to build an architectural castle square, he was not however successful in carrying out these plans.

During this period, the castle was the place where the ideas of the Polish Enlightenment first flourished. The King held &quot;Thursday lunches&quot; at the Castle for scientists, scholars, writers, and artists. This was where the idea for the National Education Commission; one of the first secular Ministries of Education in Europe, was mooted. The castle was the place where the first proposals were made for a Knights&#x27; School, and for a national theatre. It was in the Senate Chamber in the Castle that what was known as the &quot;Great Sejm&quot; (Great Parliament) passed the famous Polish Constitution of 3 May, 1791. During the ceremony the King was carried out to the nearby church of St. John. In honour of this occasion, a marble plaque with Ignacy Krasicki&#x27;s text written on it was set into the wall of the castle.

=== In partitioned Poland and the Second Polish Republic ===
Between 19 and 20 December 1806 and 1–30 January 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte, the French emperor, spent his time at the castle. Here in 1807 he made the decision to form the Duchy of Warsaw, which was to be ruled by the Saxon king Frederick August I, using the Royal Castle as his residence. Prince Józef Poniatowski, Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw and Marshal of France, resided in the Copper-Roof Palace joined to the castle. After the creation of the constitutional Kingdom of Poland (1815), its parliaments met here at the castle. As kings of Poland, the Russian Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I also resided in the castle when they stayed in Warsaw. During the November Uprising, on 25 January 1831, the Sejm debating in the castle dethroned Tsar Nicholas I as Polish king.

In 1836, the voivodeships of Congress Poland were abolished and replaced by guberniyas. During that time, the Royal Castle became the residence of the Tsar&#x27;s governor Ivan Paskievich. Paskievich charged Ludvik Corio – a Russian Colonel and architect – with designing new elevations and façades (the west, south, and east parts). However, the Russian authorities were not satisfied with the new designs, and Corio was told to prepare another design – one that would refer to Kubicki&#x27;s solutions (and his co-workers Lelewel and Thomas). Finally, Corio rebuilt all the elevations and façades in the neoclassical style, but the Saxon Elevation was left the same. After the death of Paskievich in 1856, all the next governors resided in the Royal Castle&#x27;s Chamberlain&#x27;s Room. The Russian officials occupied rooms on both floors of the west and north wings of the castle. The governors were heavily guarded by the Russian army. Unfortunately, the living space that was assigned to these soldiers was the Parliamentary Hall, Library, and barracks under the castle. As a result, these were left devastated.

After the January Uprising in 1863, the Russian army totally destroyed the Royal garden on the Vistula side (which was transformed into the military parade square), building a few barracks made of brick for stables and Cossacks&#x27; barracks. In 1862–1863, some maintenance work was done in the Royal Castle under the supervision of Jerzy Orłowicz, Ludwik Gosławski and Potolov. In 1890, the Saxon Elevation was rebuilt under the supervision of a builder January Kiślański, when the arcades of both viewing galleries, dating back to the Augustus III period, were deformed. The last repair works, which cost 28,000 rubles, during the reign of Russia, were in 1902 in the rooms which had been occupied by the Russian army.

During the First World War, it was the residence of the German military governor. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the castle became the residence of the president of Poland. It was restored under the guidance of Kazimierz Skórewicz (1920–1928) and Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz (until 1939). Under the terms of the peace treaty signed with Soviet Russia at Riga in 1920, works of art and other precious things, including all the castle furnishings, which had been taken away to Russia, were brought back to Poland. As a result, it was possible to restore the historic rooms to their appearance in the reign of Stanisław II Augustus.

=== During World War II ===
On 17 September 1939, the castle was shelled by German artillery. The roof and the turrets were destroyed by fire (they were partly restored by the castle&#x27;s staff, but later deliberately removed by the Germans). The ceiling of the Ballroom collapsed, resulting in the destruction of Marcello Bacciarelli&#x27;s ceiling fresco &quot;The Creation of the World&quot; and other rooms were slightly damaged. But immediately after the seizure of Warsaw by the Germans, their occupation troops set to demolish the castle. The more valuable objects, even including the central heating and ventilation installations, were dismantled and taken away to Germany.

On 4 October 1939 in Berlin, Adolf Hitler issued the order to blow up the Royal Castle. On 10 October 1939, special German units, under the supervision of history and art experts (Dr. Dagobert Frey, an art historian at the University of Breslau; Gustaw Barth, the director of museums in Breslau, and Dr. Joseph Mühlmann, an art historian from Vienna) started to demount floors, marbles, sculptures, and stone elements such as fireplaces or moulds. The artefacts were taken to Germany or stored in Kraków&#x27;s warehouses. Many of them were also seized by various Nazi dignitaries who resided in Warsaw. The castle was totally emptied. Disobeying German orders, despite the danger of being shot, Polish museum staff and experts in art restoration managed to save many of the works of art from the castle, as well as fragments of the stucco-work, the parquet floors, the wood panelling, and more which were later used in the reconstruction. The great service done to Poland by Professor Stanisław Lorentz, in leading this campaign to save the castle&#x27;s treasures, is well known. Wehrmacht sappers then bored tens of thousands of holes for dynamite charges in the stripped walls.

In 1944, after the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising, when hostilities had already ceased, the Germans blew up the castle&#x27;s demolished walls. Leveling the Royal Castle was only a part of a larger plan – the Pabst Plan – the goal of which was to build a monumental Community Hall (ger. &quot;Volkshalle&quot;) or an equally sizable Congress Hall of NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party – ger. &quot;Parteivolkshalle&quot;) in the Royal Castle&#x27;s place and to replace Sigismund&#x27;s Column with the Germania Monument.

A pile of rubble, surmounted by only two fragments of walls, was all that was left of the six-hundred-year-old edifice. On one of these fragments part of the stucco decoration remained, this was a cartouche with the royal version of the motto of the Order of the White Eagle — &quot;PRO FIDE, LEGE ET REGE&quot; (for Faith, Law, and King).

=== Reconstruction ===
Immediately after the end of war in 1945, work started on rescuing the surviving fragments of the castle&#x27;s walls, foundations, and cellars as well as the fire-blackened walls of the Copper-Roof Palace and the Royal Library building, from further destruction. In 1949, the Polish Parliament passed a bill to rebuild the castle as a monument to Polish history and culture. Meanwhile, special architectural designing offices, under Jan Dąbrowski, Piotr Biegański and Jan Zachwatowicz, drew up blueprints for restoring the framework of the building and furnishing the historical rooms. The decision to start work was postponed several times, but was finally taken on 20 January 1971. A Civic Committee was set up. Amid universal applause, it was decided to rebuild the castle from voluntary contributions. Both in Poland and abroad, fund-raising committees were set up.

By May 1975, the Fund had already reached the 500 million zlotys. By the same date more than a thousand valuable works of art had been given to the castle by numerous Poles resident both in Poland and abroad. Official representatives of other countries have likewise presented to the castle works of art of great artistic and historic value.

== Today ==
The imposing façade, built of brick, is long and faces the Castle Square. At each end of the façade stands a square tower with a bulbous spire. The Sigismund&#x27;s Tower is located in the centre of the main façade, flanked on both sides by the castle. This huge clock tower ( in height), designed in the 17th century, has always been a symbol of the Polish capital and source of inspiration for the architects of other buildings in Warsaw. The castle now serves as a museum and is subordinated to the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. Many official visits and state meetings are also held in the Royal Castle.

== Interior ==

The interior consists of many different rooms, all painstakingly restored with as many original exhibits as possible after the destruction of the Second World War.

* The Jagiellonian Rooms
These rooms, which belonged to the residence of Sigismund Augustus, are now host to a number of portraits of the Jagiellon dynasty, a royal dynasty originating in Lithuania that reigned in several Central European countries between the 14th and 16th century. In 2011, the Jagiellonian Rooms were re-arranged to house the modern Gallery of Painting, Sculpture and Decorative Arts.

* The Houses of Parliament
From the 16th century onwards, Polish democracy started here. In 1573, amendments to the constitution of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were written here, with great religious tolerance. Also, during the Deluge in 1652, the liberum veto was established in these rooms, although not carried out until 1669. In 1791, the May Constitution, Europe&#x27;s first modern codified national constitution as well as the second-oldest national constitution in the world, was drafted here.
The decorations in the room are replicas of the originals by Giovanni Battista di Quadro.

* The Royal Apartments
In these apartments, King Stanisław Augustus Poniatowski lived. They consist of the Canaletto room, in which several painted views of Warsaw are on display. These were not painted by Canaletto, but rather by his nephew, Bernardo Bellotto also called &quot;il Canaletto&quot;. Jean-Baptiste Pillement worked between 1765 and 1767 on one of his largest projects, the wallpaper. Domenico Merlini designed the adjacent Royal Chapel in 1776. Nowadays, the heart of Tadeusz Kościuszko is kept here in an urn. The Audience Rooms are also designed by Merlini, with four paintings by Marcello Bacciarelli on display. Andrzej Grzybowski took care of the restoration of the room, that included many original pieces.

* Lanckoroński Collection
In 1994, Countess Karolina Lanckorońska donated 37 pictures to the Royal Castle. Collection includes two paintings (portraits) by Rembrandt: &quot;The Father of the Jewish Bride&quot; (also known as &quot;The Scholar at the Lectern&quot;) and &quot;The Jewish Bride&quot; (also known as &quot;The Girl in a Picture Frame&quot;) both originally in the Stanisław Augustus Poniatowski collection.

In December 2018, the castle acquired a violin created by Antonio Stradivari in 1685. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of Poland regaining its independence, the instrument was officially given the name &quot;Polonia&quot;. The virtuoso violinist Jerzy Wawrowski is the only person who is allowed to play on the instrument.

In December 2018, a painting by Marcello Bacciarelli titled &quot;Portrait of Jerzy Mniszech with Daughter Elizabeth and Kiopek&quot; (1795), which was considered missing, was returned to the castle&#x27;s collections.

== Copper-Roof Palace ==
The Copper-Roof Palace has since 1989 been a branch of the Royal Castle Museum. The palace is contiguous with Warsaw&#x27;s Royal Castle, and down a slope from the Castle Square and Old Town. It was originally a patrician house of Wawrzyniec Reffus, it was built 1651–1656. After 1657 destruction by the army of George II Rákóczi, it was completely remodeled in 1698–1701 for Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski.

Lubomirski expanded the palace by building a southern wing, perpendicular to the rest of structure, and also expanded the western elevation. Shortly after its construction the palace became known as &quot;Palais Martin&quot;, after Lubomirski&#x27;s grandson. In 1720 the palace was rebuilt with an addition of a second northern wing. Additionally the interior was decorated with rococo paintings. After 1777 the palace passed into ownership of Poland&#x27;s last king, Stanisław II Augustus, who hired the architect Domenico Merlini to once again redesign the inside rooms of the palace and join the library wing of the Royal Castle to it. The King then made a present of the redecorated place to his nephew Prince Józef Poniatowski The younger Poniatowski was a successful commander in the 1794 Kościuszko Uprising, and later one of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s marshala. Under his ownership the palace became a center of Warsaw&#x27;s high class social scene. When Warsaw became part of Kingdom of Prussia after the Third Partition of Poland the buildings became the headquarters for the Prussian Ministry of War.

The Copper-Roof Palace was burned in 1944 and reconstructed, based on paintings of Bernardo Bellotto, between 1948 and 1949.

Currently the palace is a museum hosting, &quot;inter alia&quot;, a permanent exhibition of oriental carpets and other oriental decorative art, donated to the museum by Mrs. Teresa Sahakian. The collection comprises 579 items, 562 of which are textiles.

== Interesting facts ==
*On 24 May 1829 in the Royal Castle&#x27;s Senator&#x27;s Hall, Nicholas I of Russia was crowned King of Poland.
*On 5 November 1916, the Act of 5 November was announced in the Grand Hall.
*On 23 April 1935, the April Constitution was signed in the &quot;Knight Hall&quot;.
*Stanisław Augustus Poniatowski&#x27;s regalia are kept in the Royal Chapel. These are the Order of the White Eagle, the ceremonial sword of the Saint Stanisław&#x27;s Order and aquamarine sceptre.
*The insignia of presidential power are also stored in the Castle- the stamp of the President, the Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland and national documents, which Ryszard Kaczorowski gave to Lech Wałęsa on 22 December 1990.
*Many of the Polish legends are connected with the Royal Castle. According to one of them in 1569 the King Sigismund Augustus, who was in mourning after death of his beloved wife Barbara Radziwiłł, asked the renowned sorcerer Master Twardowski to evoke her ghost. The experiment was successful with support of a magic mirror, which today is kept in the Węgrów Cathedral. Despite that some people suspected that it was not the Queen&#x27;s ghost but closely resembling her king&#x27;s mistress Barbara Giżanka and the whole event was set up by Giżanka&#x27;s accomplice Mikołaj Mniszech, king&#x27;s chamberlain.
*The Royal Castle in Warsaw is one of the official members of the Association of the Royal Residences of Europe.
*In 2014, the National Bank of Poland issued a 5 zloty coin in a series called &quot;Discover Poland&quot; depicting the Royal Castle in Warsaw.

== Chicago replica ==
In 1979, the historic Gateway Theatre in the Jefferson Park community area of Chicago was purchased by the Copernicus Foundation with the intention of converting it into the seat of the Polish Cultural and Civic Center. Because of the building&#x27;s historical significance, its interior was kept intact while the exterior was remodelled and a Neo-Baroque clock tower was added to give it the resemblance of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. It is a visual tribute to Chicago&#x27;s large Polish populace, the largest such presence outside of Poland.

<text>Incremental encoding, also known as front compression, back compression, or front coding, is a type of delta encoding compression algorithm whereby common prefixes or suffixes and their lengths are recorded so that they need not be duplicated. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for compressing sorted data, e.g., a list of words from a dictionary.

For example:
The encoding used to store the common prefix length itself varies from application to application. Typical techniques are storing the value as a single byte; delta encoding, which stores only the change in the common prefix length; and various universal codes. It may be combined with other general lossless data compression techniques such as entropy encoding and dictionary coders to compress the remaining suffixes.

== Applications ==

Incremental encoding is widely used in information retrieval to compress the lexicons used in search indexes; these list all the words found in all the documents and a pointer for each one to a list of locations. Typically, it compresses these indexes by about 40%.

As one example, incremental encoding is used as a starting point by the GNU locate utility, in an index of filenames and directories. The GNU locate utility further uses bigram encoding to further shorten popular filepath prefixes.

<text>Thomas Witherell Palmer (January 25, 1830 – June 1, 1913) was a U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan. He is considered to be one of the most significant figures in the history of Detroit, Michigan.

Palmer was born in Detroit, where his mother was the daughter of the third Michigan Territorial Judge James Witherell, while his father was a New England merchant who had settled in the city following the War of 1812. Palmer attended the public schools, Thompson&#x27;s Academy in Palmer (now St. Clair), and studied one year at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He traveled to Spain and South America and then entered the real estate business in Detroit in 1853 and then engaged in lumbering and agricultural pursuits with his future father-in-law, Charles Merrill, beginning in 1855. He served on the first board of directors and as the first president for the Michigan Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (now known as the Michigan Humane Society).

He served on the Board of Estimates of Detroit in 1873 and was a member of the Michigan State Senate 1879–1880. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1883 after decorated Senator Thomas W. Ferry handpicked Palmer as his successor. He served from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1889. He was not a candidate for reelection. He was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries in the 49th Congress, and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry in the 50th Congress. While in the Senate, he became known as an advocate for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, immigration restrictions, and homesteader rights. He is credited with coining a phrase widely adopted by latter-day reformers, &quot;Equal rights for all, special privileges to none.&quot; On February 6, 1885, he delivered a noted speech arguing in favor of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting women&#x27;s suffrage.

Palmer was appointed United States Minister to Spain on March 12, 1889, by U.S. President Benjamin Harrison and served from June 17, 1889, to April 19, 1890. He was president of the National Commission of the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago 1890–1893. He retired to his Wayne County farm near Detroit.

Palmer and his wife, Lizzie Pitts Merrill Palmer, became known for their generous gifts to the city of Detroit. Among his activities, Palmer was one of the major benefactors of the Michigan Soldiers and Sailors Monument erected at Campus Martius. In honor of his mother, he built the Mary W. Palmer Memorial Church. He was also one of the founders and the first president of the Detroit Museum of Art (now known as the Detroit Institute of Arts), to which he contributed $16,000 and its current building stands on the site of Palmer&#x27;s former home.

Lizzie Palmer in 1901 commissioned the Merrill Fountain in Campus Martius, dedicated in honor of her father. New York architects Carrere and Hastings are responsible for the design. The fountain was moved to Palmer Park in 1926. She bequeathed $3 million to found the Merrill-Palmer Institute in 1916, which is a national center for child and family development and is now affiliated with Wayne State University and located in the former house of Charles Lang Freer.

In 1897, Palmer donated 140 acres (60 hectares) of land along Woodward Avenue to the city for use as a public park. This land formed the basis of Palmer Park. Palmer had inherited the land from his grandfather Michigan Territorial Judge James Witherell. In 1885, the Palmers had had the prominent architecture firm of Mason &amp; Rice design a rustic log cabin-style summer house on the land, which still remains in the park, although it is currently closed to visitors.

Palmer was a Unitarian and a member of the Freemasons. He died in Detroit and is interred in Elmwood Cemetery.

<text>A table engine is a variety of stationary steam engine where the cylinder is placed on top of a table-shaped base, the legs of which stand on the baseplate which locates the crankshaft bearings. The piston rod protrudes from the top of the cylinder and has fixed to it a cross-head which runs in slides attached to, and rising from, the cylinder top. Long return rods connect the crosshead to the crankshaft, on which is fixed the flywheel.

This pattern of engine was first introduced by James Sadler at the Portsmouth Dockyard in 1798 and was house-built in that its framing was formed by the engine house, as had been common practice for beam engines.

Henry Maudslay patented an improved version of this a few years later, and other makers adopted the configuration.

It was supplied for low-speed, low-power applications around the first half of the nineteenth century. They continued to be made in a range of sizes, down to very small, with a bore and stroke of only a few inches.

The table engine was one of the first types where the engine was constructed as an independent unit, rather than being house-built. This made the engines cheaper, and more importantly quicker, to erect on site. Entire engines could be built and tested at their factory before delivery. Engines could also be pre-built, then offered for sale from stock, rather than having to be designed and constructed for each site.

One reason for the continued use of a vertical cylinder was the belief that with a horizontal cylinder, the weight of the piston within the cylinder would lead to uneven wear on the lower bore of the cylinder. This erroneous view was not dispelled until around 1830 and the increasing number of steam locomotives using horizontal cylinders without such wear problems.

<doc id="869444" wikidata="Q452891" url="?curid=869444" title="Laser-induced fluorescence">
<text>Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or laser-stimulated fluorescence (LSF) is a spectroscopic method in which an atom or molecule is excited to a higher energy level by the absorption of laser light followed by spontaneous emission of light. It was first reported by Zare and coworkers in 1968.

LIF is used for studying structure of molecules, detection of selective species and flow visualization and measurements. The wavelength is often selected to be the one at which the species has its largest cross section. The excited species will after some time, usually in the order of few nanoseconds to microseconds, de-excite and emit light at a wavelength longer than the excitation wavelength. This fluorescent light is typically recorded with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or filtered photodiodes.

==Types==
Two different kinds of spectra exist, disperse spectra and excitation spectra.

The disperse spectra are performed with a fixed lasing wavelength, as above and the fluorescence spectrum is analyzed. Excitation scans on the other hand collect fluorescent light at a fixed emission wavelength or range of wavelengths. Instead the lasing wavelength is changed.

An advantage over absorption spectroscopy is that it is possible to get two- and three-dimensional images since fluorescence takes place in all directions (i.e. the fluorescence signal is usually isotropic). The signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence signal is very high, providing a good sensitivity to the process. It is also possible to distinguish between more species, since the lasing wavelength can be tuned to a particular excitation of a given species which is not shared by other species.

LIF is useful in the study of the electronic structure of molecules and their interactions. It has also been successfully applied for quantitative measurement of concentrations in fields like combustion, plasma, spray and flow phenomena (such as molecular tagging velocimetry), in some cases visualizing concentrations down to nanomolar levels. LED-induced fluorescence has been used in situ to delineate aromatic hydrocarbon contamination as a cone penetrometer add on module and also as a percussive capable asset.

== Applications ==
* Detection of purity
* Optical tumor diagnosis
* Imaging of paleontological specimens
*Detection and quantification of biomolecules and biological processes (e.g. DNA sequencing, trace protein analysis, polymerase chain reaction products, and single-cell analysis)
* In plasma diagnostics, which measures plasma properties such as the ion distribution function and velocity space diffusion and convection in a plasma

<doc id="869449" wikidata="Q16965571" url="?curid=869449" title="Prayer of Columbus">
<text>&quot;Prayer of Columbus&quot; is a poem written by American poet Walt Whitman. The poem evokes the enterprising spirit of Christopher Columbus in a God-fearing light, who rediscovered the North American continent in 1492, leading to the colonization of the Americas by the emerging European powers. Although the Viking Leif Ericson has generally been credited as having discovered the North American continent roughly 500 years earlier, Columbus&#x27; rediscovery has had a more lasting impact on the colonization trends that continued until around the onset of World War I. Thus, Whitman&#x27;s poem serves as a fitting tribute to the proper explorer.

Whitman first wrote &quot;Prayer of Columbus&quot; in late 1873 before its first publication in the March 1874 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. It was then published in &quot;Two Rivulets&quot; in 1876 before being incorporated into the 1881 edition of &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. Scholar Linda Wagner-Martin notes that the poem is &quot;unusually autobiographical&quot; for Whitman, in that it incorporates his own experiences with declining health and aging.

==Legacy==
Portions of Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Prayer of Columbus&quot; have been inscribed in gilded letters in the marble wall of the Archives/Navy Memorial metro station in Washington, D.C.

In modern times the poem has been set to music by various composers including Robert Strassburg.

<doc id="869456" wikidata="Q362462" url="?curid=869456" title="Thomas Brown (Florida politician)">
<text>Thomas Brown (October 24, 1785 – August 24, 1867) was an American politician who served as Florida&#x27;s second Governor from 1849 to 1853. He is buried at the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee.

== Early life ==
Thomas Brown was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, United States, home to George Washington, James Monroe, and others.

Brown served in the War of 1812, and subsequently became chief clerk of the post office at Richmond. While in that position, he invented the post office letter box.

In 1828, Brown moved with his family to the Florida Territory.

== Politics ==

Brown, a Whig, became auditor of the Florida Territory in 1834, president of the legislative council in 1838, a member of the constitutional convention in 1839, and a member of the first Florida House of Representatives under statehood in 1845.

== Governor of Florida ==
As governor, Brown tried to improve Florida&#x27;s transportation system. Also, he complained that Florida was making slow progress on education. On January 6, 1853, he signed the bill that provided public support to higher education. East Florida Seminary in Ocala was one of the first schools to utilize this funding, but it soon closed due to the Civil War. In 1866, EFS reopened in Gainesville, and the University of Florida traces its history to this institution.

Brown was inspired by the discovery of the rich muck lands of the Lake Okeechobee area and encouraged cattlemen and farmers, protected by the Florida militia, to enter the region. Brown also made an effort to determine whether the Everglades should be drained. During this period, Fort Myers was developed into a full-sized village.

In December 1855, Lt. George Hartsuff, on a &quot;survey&quot; of Seminole facilities, ran survey lines across Billy Bowlegs&#x27; prize banana garden and the Seminole Indians returned to war.

== Other accomplishments, and death ==
Brown was an active Mason for more than 60 years, serving as Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of the State of Florida from 1834-1836 and compiling a book on Masonry. Governor Brown died in Tallahassee on August 24, 1867.

In 1834, Brown built a hotel called Brown&#x27;s Inn in Tallahassee, located on the west side of Adams Street, between Pensacola and Lafayette streets. In 1839 it was known as the City Hotel, in 1840 as the Adelphi, and later as the Morgan Hotel. It was destroyed by fire in 1886.

<doc id="869459" wikidata="Q921557" url="?curid=869459" title="Shenzhou 1">
<text>Shenzhou 1 () launched on 19 November 1999, was the first uncrewed launch of the Shenzhou spacecraft. The spacecraft used was not equipped with a life support system, but did come with an emergency escape system. After orbiting the Earth 14 times, the command for retrofire was sent by the &quot;Yuan Wang 3&quot; tracking ship off the coast of Namibia at 18:49 UTC. After a successful reentry it landed about east of its launch pad and north-west of Wuhai, Inner Mongolia.

The first Shenzhou spacecraft was different from those later used. Instead of featuring unfolding solar panels, &quot;Shenzhou 1&quot; was equipped with fixed solar cells. During this first flight there were also no orbit changes. According to Qi Faren, the chief designer of the spacecraft, only 8 of the 13 sub-systems on board the spacecraft were operational. Shenzhou 1 was designed primarily to test the Long March 2F rocket. The only systems and capabilities tested on the spacecraft were the separation of the modules, attitude control, lifting body reentry, the heat shield, and ground recovery.

The spacecraft is thought to have carried of seeds to investigate the effects on them of the space environment. It is also thought that the front of the Orbital module was equipped with a dummy ELINT package, with Shenzhou 2 onwards equipped with fully functional models.

It was announced in June 1999 that the flight would take place in October of that year. At about the same time images were released on a Chinese military internet forum of the Long March 2F launcher and the Vehicle Assembly Building that would be used. After a reported propellant explosion at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (though the explosion was denied by Chinese officials) the launch was pushed back.

== Mission parameters ==

* NSSDC ID: 1999-061A
* Mass: 7600 kg
* Perigee: 195 km
* Apogee: 315 km
* Inclination: 42.6°

<doc id="869466" wikidata="Q300373" url="?curid=869466" title="A Collection of Beatles Oldies">
<text>A Collection of Beatles Oldies (subtitled But Goldies!) is a compilation album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released in the United Kingdom in December 1966, it features hit singles and other songs issued by the group between 1963 and 1966. The compilation served as a stopgap release to satisfy EMI&#x27;s demand for product during the Christmas period, since the Beatles had only begun recording &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, the follow-up to their &quot;Revolver&quot; album, late the previous month. It was the band&#x27;s first official greatest hits collection, although the Beatles had no involvement in the album.

The album&#x27;s preparation and release coincided with rumours in the press that the group were on the verge of splitting up. This speculation was encouraged by the band members&#x27; high-profile individual activities since completing their final US tour, in late August 1966, and the announcement that, unlike in previous years, the Beatles would not be performing any concerts in Britain at the end of the year. The album cover is a painting combining contemporary psychedelic and op art themes and was commissioned by the band&#x27;s manager, Brian Epstein. To adherents of the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; hoax, the artwork offered the first clues relating to the alleged demise of Paul McCartney and his replacement in the Beatles by a lookalike, a scenario that is said to have taken place in November 1966 and been facilitated by the group&#x27;s retirement from live performance.

&quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; offered the debut album release in Britain for many of the band&#x27;s singles, although these songs had been available on compilation EPs since their initial release. It also provided the debut release in stereo for these recordings, since the Beatles favoured mono mixes for their singles until 1969. The compilation peaked at number 7 on the UK Albums Chart, where all the band&#x27;s previous albums had held the top spot. It was also released in some other European countries and, in 1968, in Australia. The album was deleted from the Beatles&#x27; catalogue following the reissue of their albums on compact disc in 1987.

== Background ==
The Beatles made the decision to retire from live performance in 1966, dissatisfied at playing to audiences of screaming fans, and following a series of controversies that had tarnished the band&#x27;s image throughout the year. Those controversies included the unfavourable reaction to the butcher cover originally used for the band&#x27;s American album &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;, death threats and political incidents during their visits to Japan and the Philippines, and condemnation from some religious groups in America in response to John Lennon&#x27;s comment that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. After completing their world tour on 29 August, the four band members took a break from group activities for three months. Due to the attention that their individual activities received, by early November, rumours in the press claimed that the band were breaking up. Alternatively, according to a report in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the Beatles were to sever ties with their longtime manager, Brian Epstein, and instead be represented by Allen Klein. Fans of the band were disappointed by the announcement that, in a break from the tradition established in 1963, the Beatles were not playing any UK shows over the Christmas period. On 10 November, four days after 200 fans had demonstrated outside Epstein&#x27;s home in central London, newspapers reported that there would be no further concert tours by the Beatles.
Although Epstein voiced support for the Beatles&#x27; continuing evolution as artists, highlighting the advances they had made with their August 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;, this period was one of doubt and anxiety for him. As a manager who thrived on organising the group&#x27;s concert appearances, he began to worry that their enormous popularity might be coming to an end, or would diminish in the absence of new musical product. In the Beatles&#x27; absence, &quot;The Monkees&quot; – a television show starring four California-based musician-actors, brought together as a Beatles-like act – had first aired in September and soon won over the teenybopper audience that the band had sought to lose. In late October, Epstein informed EMI that, unlike in the previous three years, no new Beatles material would be ready in time for a Christmas release. As a result, the record company planned a compilation album, titled &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies (But Goldies!)&quot;, for release in Britain and other territories overseen by EMI.

According to their press officer, Tony Barrow, the Beatles were opposed to the release of the compilation. The band returned to work on 24 November, when they began the recording sessions for their album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Although an article in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated that the band would issue a new single in December, the only other scheduled release, aside from the new compilation, was the Beatles&#x27; annual fan-club Christmas record. Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner commented that it was surprising that EMI&#x27;s US counterpart, Capitol Records, did not also issue the compilation album, given the company&#x27;s policy of maximising the number of Beatles releases in North America.

==Preparation==
===Song selection===
&quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; was the band&#x27;s first official greatest-hits set and their eighth official album release in Britain. The album was hurriedly prepared, to satisfy EMI&#x27;s concerns. A cover version of Larry Williams&#x27; &quot;Bad Boy&quot; was the sole new track for the UK market, although it had already been released in the United States, on the Capitol album &quot;Beatles VI&quot; in June 1965. Thirteen of the fifteen other songs had been issued as singles, all of which had topped the national chart compiled by &quot;Record Retailer&quot; magazine (subsequently adopted as the UK Singles Chart). &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; first two hit singles, were not included.

The compilation provided the debut UK album release for the following singles tracks: &quot;From Me to You&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;. The two songs that had not been issued as UK singles (apart from &quot;Bad Boy&quot;), &quot;Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot;, had each been number 1 hits in other European countries overseen by EMI. Aside from their appearances on albums or as standalone singles, most of the songs on &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; had also been available on the various compilation EPs issued by EMI since 1963, one of which was the December 1965 release &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Million Sellers&quot;. EMI therefore pushed for the inclusion of &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, to ensure that British fans had a reason to buy the new compilation album.

===Stereo mixing===

Several tracks, including &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, were remixed in stereo for the album, since the majority of the Beatles&#x27; singles had only been mixed for mono release previously. The stereo mixing was overseen by George Martin, the Beatles&#x27; producer, with none of the band members present. The mixing sessions took place between 31 October and 10 November 1966 at EMI Studios (later Abbey Road Studios) in London.

Martin was surprised at how time-consuming the remixing of &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; proved to be. In the case of &quot;She Loves You&quot;, the 1963 two-track recording tape had since been reused, forcing EMI engineer Geoff Emerick to return to the mono master and create a &quot;mock stereo&quot; mix. This was achieved by removing the high frequencies from the left channel and the low frequencies from the right. They had also intended to remix &quot;From Me to You&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; first song to top the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart, but this did not take place.

The final day of the album&#x27;s preparation was carried out without Martin and Emerick. Author Kenneth Womack writes of their absence, as of the Beatles&#x27; non-participation: &quot;Clearly, &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; was the sole priority of EMI at this juncture.&quot; Two other EMI engineers, Peter Bown and Graham Kirkby, remixed &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; that day. They then worked on &quot;This Boy&quot;, the B-side of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, but this was due to a miscommunication with EMI&#x27;s office in Manchester Square, where the song had been confused with &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. The error was discovered later, by which point there was no time to remix &quot;Bad Boy&quot; and the original mix was used for the compilation.

==Artwork==
The album cover is a painting by artist David Christian, who captured the vibrant colours then popular in London&#x27;s Carnaby Street fashion boutiques. In the description of music journalist Martin O&#x27;Gorman, the cover image partly reflects the popularity of retro boutiques such as I Was Lord Kitchener&#x27;s Valet; it also includes a man with a mop-top haircut reclining on a chair and &quot;clad in Day-Glo striped trousers and a garishly patterned tie&quot;. O&#x27;Gorman adds that, except for the moustaches that the four Beatles had recently grown, the artist had captured the band&#x27;s new psychedelic image, which would be unveiled in the film clips for the two songs on their next single, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&#x27;Gorman/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;O&#x27;Gorman, Martin. &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in the 3 December issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the painting was a &quot;colorful Op-Art&quot; work that had been commissioned by Epstein.
The back of the LP sleeve featured a photograph of the group taken by Robert Whitaker. The photo was taken in the Tokyo Hilton,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt/Whitaker&quot;&gt;Hunt, Chris. &quot;Here, There &amp; Everywhere&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; where the band members were confined for much of their 1966 concert tour of Japan due to security concerns. Author Colin Larkin comments that, in comparison with their look as live performers, their &quot;image as pin-up pop stars was also undergoing a metamorphosis&quot; by late 1966. The Beatles are shown inspecting &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; that the Japanese promoter had arranged to have brought to the group&#x27;s hotel suite, on 1 and 2 July,&lt;ref name=&quot;Irvin/Strokes&quot;&gt;Irvin, Jim. &quot;Different Strokes&quot;. In: .&lt;/ref&gt; to help fill the time before their shows at the Budokan Hall.

The LP cover was one of several references to the Beatles that the English band Oasis incorporated into the artwork for their albums and singles from 1994 onwards, at a time when the Britpop movement drew heavily on the visual style of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; period. The image of the Beatles in the Tokyo hotel room served as inspiration for the photograph used on Oasis&#x27; debut album, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, taken by Michael Spencer Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME/Oasis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Paul is dead&quot; interpretation===
From &quot;Revolver&quot; onwards, the Beatles&#x27; more dedicated fans began analysing the band&#x27;s song lyrics for hidden meaning, and, in the description of American academic Camille Paglia, their album covers were also &quot;feverishly scrutinized for clues and coded messages&quot;. The cover of &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; was viewed as the first example of the Beatles leaving clues relating to the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; hoax. This theory, which escalated in late 1969, contended that Paul McCartney had been decapitated in a car crash in November 1966 and replaced in the band by a lookalike – a subterfuge that was facilitated by their retirement from live performance and change of image for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Proponents of the theory noted that four figures were pictured around a car in the top left corner of the painting, and that another car appeared to be heading straight towards the head of the man reclining in the chair, who supposedly looked most like McCartney out of all the Beatles. In addition, if the first two letters of the word printed on the bass drum, &quot;OLDIES&quot;, are each advanced alphabetically, the word becomes a message stating &quot;PM [for Paul McCartney] dies&quot;.

The back-cover photo is also cited as evidence in the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; hoax, because of McCartney&#x27;s atypical black attire, his distance from Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison, and the appearance of smoke around him. This clue represents ectoplasm, suggesting, in the description of author Nicholas Kollerstrom, that McCartney&#x27;s presence is merely an &quot;apparition&quot;.

==Release==
EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label released &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; on 9 December 1966. With speculation continuing to surround the Beatles&#x27; future, Independent Television News (ITN) filmed its &quot;Reporting &#x27;66&quot; segment outside EMI Studios on 20 December; each of the band members was interviewed on arrival and assured ITN&#x27;s reporter that they were not going to break up. Otherwise, the only television appearance that month by a member of the Beatles was when Lennon appeared in the &quot;Not Only ... But Also&quot; Christmas special. On &quot;Record Retailer&quot;″s LPs chart (later the UK Albums Chart), where all of the group&#x27;s previous albums had held the top position for a minimum of seven weeks, the compilation reached number 7. On the national chart published by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, it peaked at number 4.

At this time, the Beatles came second in the World Vocal Group category in the &quot;NME&quot;″s annual readers poll, finishing with 5221 votes to the Beach Boys&#x27; 5321 – marking the only year between 1963 and 1969 that the Beatles failed to win in that category. Reports in &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;KRLA Beat&quot; attributed this result partly to the lack of new music from the band, and the fact that they had not toured the UK in 1966. According to author Jonathan Gould, Epstein&#x27;s concern was the Monkees, whose rise influenced his decision to cede to EMI&#x27;s demands and release &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; as a single in February 1967.

According to Official Charts Company researcher Sharon Mawer, EMI had been expecting to achieve the &quot;biggest album&quot; of the year with the first compilation of the Beatles&#x27; greatest hits, but &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; proved to be &quot;one of the biggest miscalculations of the pop charts&quot;. She concluded that fans were unwilling to pay for an LP that, aside from &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, repackaged recordings
they already owned and &quot;The era of the successful Greatest Hits compilation was not yet with us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawer/OCC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released in Australia in 1968, after EMI&#x27;s regional office had issued two greatest hits sets exclusive to the local market, in late 1966 and early 1967. There, the retrospectively compiled Kent Music Report recorded a chart peak for &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; of number 7. The album returned to the UK chart on several occasions in the early 1970s, including placing at number 32 in April 1970 and number 38 in July 1972.

==Critical reception==

Among contemporary reviews, &quot;Tracks&quot; commented that the album &quot;ought to give some indication of how the Beatles have developed, but it proves mainly how much more variety there is in their albums than in their singles&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; reviewer criticised the omission of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and considered &quot;Bad Boy&quot; &quot;probably the worst on the album&quot;. The writer said that the album would only appeal to &quot;the occasional Beatle buyers&quot;, but added, &quot;doubtless there are enough of them to make this into a chart-topper.&quot;

Writing in the 1970s, &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said of the compilation: &quot;Once again, it was Christmas – and the Beatles had &quot;no new product&quot; to give to EMI for their Santa sack! As a last resort, a predictable collection of oldies was hastily assembled and crammed into an inferior Carnaby-Street-style carrier-bag sleeve.&quot; They also commented on the record company&#x27;s propensity, starting in 1963, for releasing the Beatles&#x27; hits and other previously issued songs on EPs – an approach they describe as an &quot;Old Ukrainian saying: if it moves, sell it&quot;. Author Robert Rodriguez criticises EMI&#x27;s commercial motivation, adding: &quot;It must have been obvious to anyone paying attention that, given the low-rent design and their own oft-stated aversion to compilations, the Beatles had nothing to do with this project.&quot;

Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes it as a &quot;fair, if safe, mid-career compendium&quot;. In his review for AllMusic, Richard Ginell says that EMI did give fans value for their money, by offering sixteen songs instead of the usual quota of fourteen for a British LP release, one of which was the previously unissued track. Ginell writes that, in retrospect, the compilation stands as &quot;a decent summing up of the Beatles&#x27; achievement just before the plunge into &#x27;Strawberry Fields&#x27; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ginell/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a December 1971 report in &quot;Billboard&quot; on the preference for UK-pressed LPs among Los Angeles record-buyers, &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; was one of the most popular imported titles, and recognised as good value for its generous number of songs relative to the US industry standard. For many years after its release, the 1966 compilation remained the only British album to contain the Beatles&#x27; version of &quot;Bad Boy&quot;. Although briefly available on the Music for Pleasure budget label, it was superseded by subsequent compilations: the band&#x27;s &quot;1962–1966&quot; greatest hits set, released in 1973, contained fifteen of the songs; the remaining track, &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, was then included on the 1976 compilation &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Music&quot;. &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; was deleted from the Beatles&#x27; catalogue following the reissue of their albums on compact disc in 1987.

<text>Young European Socialists (YES), formerly the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (ECOSY), is an association of social democratic youth organisations in Europe and the European Union.

YES is the youth organisation of the Party of European Socialists (PES) and is a sister organization of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY). The seat of the organisation is Brussels.

Full members status is held to the European Youth Forum (YFJ) which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with both these bodies.

== History ==
YES was founded as the &quot;European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth&quot; (ECOSY) in November 1992 in Oegstgeest/The Hague. The preparatory committee consisted of Philip Cordery (MJS, France), Joris Jurriëns (JS-PvdA, Netherlands), Jens Geier (Jusos, Germany), Giustina Magistretti (Italy), and Pascal Smet (Belgium).

Before 1992 the European activities had been coordinated inside IUSY, especially in the &quot;European Leaders Meeting&quot;. The foundation of ECOSY had been controversial. In particular, the Austrians and the Swedes promoted an all-European organisation, including non-EU members.

The &quot;European Socialist Youth&quot; (ESY), founded in parallel, was only a weak organisation, a short time later renamed the &quot;European Committee&quot;, one of the IUSY continental committees.

The organisation&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Young European Socialists&quot; (YES) at the 11th Congress in Bommersvik in 2013.

<doc id="869479" wikidata="Q931931" url="?curid=869479" title="Rendez-vous '87">
<text>Rendez-vous &#x27;87 was a two-game international ice hockey series of games between the Soviet Union national ice hockey team and a team of All-Stars from the National Hockey League, held in Quebec City. It replaced the NHL&#x27;s All-Star festivities for the 1986–87 NHL season. The Soviet team was paid $80,000 for their appearance in Rendez-vous &#x27;87, while the NHLers raised $350,000 for the players&#x27; pension fund.

Rendez-vous &#x27;87 was designed as a follow-up to the Challenge Cup series in 1979, hoping that the team of NHL All-Stars could beat the Soviet team, unlike before. To this end, the series was a two-game affair instead of a three-game affair in 1979. (4-2) (4-5) (0-6) The two-game series took place during five days of festivities starting on February 9, 1987 and finishing on February 13. The series was very successful, with some, including Wayne Gretzky, calling for more international hockey, especially between Canada and the Soviet Union, the two top powers of hockey at the time. The teams split the games, with the NHL winning the first game, 4–3, followed by a Soviet 5–3 victory two nights later, with Russia outscoring the NHL team 8–7 on aggregate.

==Television coverage==
While the telecasts in Canada were on CBC as usual, they were not &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; productions. The games were done as a CBC Sports production because Molson, which owned &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;&#x27;s rights at the time, was not allowed access to Le Colisée in Quebec City. Carling O&#x27;Keefe Breweries, owners of the Quebec Nordiques, assumed advertising rights for the telecasts, and the normal host(s) for &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; in 1987, rookie Ron MacLean and Dave Hodge (before his late-season exit) were replaced by Brian Williams. Even the ice-blue blazers normally worn by &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; commentators were replaced by the orange CBC sportcoats. Don Wittman and John Davidson called the action for CBC. 

The games were shown in the United States on ESPN, with Ken Wilson and Bill Clement in the booth with both Tom Mees and John Saunders serving as hosts for the event.

==Uniforms==
The NHL introduced unique All-Star uniforms to be worn for this series only. The overall design of the white jersey took its cues from the New Jersey Devils&#x27; red uniforms, with white replacing the Devils&#x27; red, orange replacing green, and black replacing white. The NHL shield was featured on the front, with two black stars to the left and right above the shield, and three additional black stars on each shoulder. The Rendez-vous &#x27;87 patch was worn on the right sleeve in lieu of the player number.

The Soviet team wore their standard red national team uniforms with white trim, with the Russian СССР on the front, and team captain Viacheslav Fetisov wearing a &quot;К&quot; for his captain&#x27;s letter. The players&#x27; names on the back, however, were romanized.

==Lineups==
==Game One – February 11, 1987==
NHL All-Stars won the game 4–3, thanks in part to the line of Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen. Dave Poulin scored the winning goal on a deflection from Mario Lemieux, but Lemieux was initially credited with the goal. On the bench, Lemieux could be seen pointing toward Poulin as the goal was announced.
* Referee: Sergei Morozov
* Linesmen: Ron Finn, Ray Scapinello

==Game Two – February 13, 1987==
The Soviets won the contest 5–3. This game featured the emergence of the young Soviet forward line consisting of Valeri Kamensky, Viacheslav Bykov, and Andrei Khomutov. After the game, the players on each team exchanged hockey sweaters as part of the hockey tradition.

<text>Camassia quamash, commonly known as camas, kwetlal, small camas, common camas, common camash or quamash, is a perennial herb. It is native to western North America in large areas of southern Canada and the northwestern United States.

==Description==
&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; is a perennial plant with a herbaceous character that has a wide range of variation across its geographical range.
It is a monocot that has grasslike leaves, as typical of that group, that emerge from a persistent bulb. The bulb is of moderate size, in diameter. The bulbs do not frequently cluster together and their surface is black while the interior is white with layers like that of an onion.

The leaves very rarely number more than nine on a plant and range in length from . In comparison to their length they are quite narrow, 4 to 20 millimeters in width. The upper surface of the leaves may or may not have a pale, waxy coating depending on the variety. All the leaves spring from the base of the plant and the sturdy stem is leafless.

The flowering stems in wild or cultivated plants can be up to , but may be as short as . As the inflorescence does not have branches it is a raceme.

The pale blue to deep blue flowers appear in late spring to early summer (May to June in their native habitat). Each of the radially symmetrical, star-shaped flowers has six tepals, about across, and six stamens.

The leaves and bulbs of the plant are similar to the toxic white-flowered meadow death-camas, a plant that is not in &quot;Camassia&quot;, but part of the death-camas genus (&quot;Toxicoscordion&quot;) and grows in the same areas.

==Taxonomy==
There are eight subspecies;
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;azurea&quot; – small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;breviflora&quot; – small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;intermedia&quot; – small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;linearis&quot; – small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;maxima&quot; – small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;quamash&quot; – common camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;utahensis&quot; – Utah small camas
*&quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;walpolei&quot; – Walpole&#x27;s small camas

=== Synonyms ===
The superseded name for &quot;Camassia quamash&quot; subsp. &quot;quamash&quot;, &quot;Camassia esculenta&quot; , should not be confused with the superseded name &quot;Camassia esculenta&quot; , (&quot;nom. illeg&quot;.) for &quot;Camassia scilloides&quot;.

===Etymology===
The genus name comes from the Nez Perce Indian name for this plant, and means &quot;sweet&quot;. &quot;Qém&#x27;es&quot;, a term for the plant&#x27;s bulb, which was gathered and used as a food source by tribes in the Pacific Northwest, and were an important food source for the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806). The bulbs are or were harvested and pit-roasted or boiled by women of the Nez Perce, Cree, and Blackfoot tribes.

==Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to western North America in large areas of southern Canada and the northwestern United States, from British Columbia and Alberta to California and east from Washington state to Montana and Wyoming.

Though the once-immense spreads of camas lands have diminished because of modern developments and agriculture, numerous camas prairies and marshes may still be seen today. In the Great Basin, expanded settlement by whites accompanied by turning cattle and hogs onto camas prairies greatly diminished food available to native tribes and increased tension between Native Americans and settlers and travelers. Both the Bannock and Nez Perce Wars began after Nez Perce became incensed at the failure of the US government to uphold treaties, and at settlers who plowed up their camas prairies, which they depended on for subsistence.

==Cultivation==
This bulb flower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally, it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Additionally, the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

==Uses==
Camas is grown as an ornamental plant. Even in the wild, large numbers of camas can color an entire meadow blue-violet.

===Food===
The bulbs of this &quot;Camassia&quot; species are edible and nutritious when roasted or boiled, but are easily confused with those of the death-camas. Though the white death-camas flowers are very different, the bulbs are difficult to distinguish.

Camas has been a food source for many native peoples in the western United States and Canada. After being harvested in the autumn, once the flowers have withered, the bulbs are pit-roasted or boiled. The latter produced a syrup. A pit-cooked camas bulb looks and tastes something like baked sweet potato, but sweeter, and with more crystalline fibers due to the presence of inulin in the bulbs—an oligosaccharide responsible for the copious flatulence caused by excessive consumption of undercooked bulbs. Bulbs can also be dried and pounded into flour, which can be used for baking or as a thickener. Native American tribes who ate camas include the Nez Perce, Cree, Coast Salish, Lummi, and Blackfoot tribes, among many others. Camas bulbs contributed to the survival of members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06).

Camas bulbs (and bannock made from them) are listed in the Ark of Taste.

<text>The Big Hill on the Canadian Pacific Railway main line in British Columbia, Canada, was the most difficult piece of railway track on the CPR&#x27;s route. It was in the rugged Canadian Rockies west of the Continental Divide of the Americas and Kicking Horse Pass. Even though the Big Hill was replaced by the Spiral Tunnels in 1909, the area has long been a challenge to the operation of trains and remains so to this day.

==Construction==
To complete the Pacific railway as quickly as possible, a decision was made to delay blasting a lengthy tunnel through Mount Stephen and instead build a temporary line over it. Instead of the desired 2.2% grade (116 feet to the mile) a steep 4.5% (some sources say 4.4%) grade was built in 1884. This was one of the steepest adhesion railway lines anywhere. (4.5% = 1 in 22). It descended from Wapta Lake to the base of Mount Stephen, along the Kicking Horse River to a point just west of Field, then rose again to meet the original route.

Seen as a temporary solution, this grade was twice the percentage normally allowed for a downhill track. The first construction train to go down the pass ran away off the hill to land in the Kicking Horse River, killing three. The CPR soon added three safety switches (runaways) on the way down to protect against runaway trains. The switches led to short spurs with a sharp reverse upgrade and they were kept in the uphill position until the operator was satisfied that the train descending the grade towards him was not out of control. Speed was restricted to for passenger trains and for freight, and elaborate brake testing was required of trains prior to descending the hill. Nevertheless, disasters occurred with dismaying frequency.

Field was created as a work camp solely to accommodate the CPR&#x27;s need for additional locomotives to be added to trains about to tackle the Big Hill. Here a stone roundhouse with turntable was built at what was first known simply as Third Siding. In December 1884 the CPR renamed it Field after C.W. Field, a Chicago businessman who, the company hoped, might invest in the region after he had visited on a special train they had provided for him.

At that time, standard steam locomotives were 4-4-0s, capable enough for the prairies and elsewhere, but of little use on the Big Hill. Baldwin Locomotive Works was called upon to build two 2-8-0s for use as Field Hill pusher engines in 1884. At the time they were the most powerful locomotives built. Two more followed in June 1886. The CPR began building its own 2-8-0s in August 1887, and over the years hundreds more were built or bought.

==Spiral Tunnels==


The Big Hill &quot;temporary&quot; line remained the main line for 25 years until the spiral tunnels were opened on September 1, 1909.

The improvement project was started in 1906, under the supervision of John Edward Schwitzer, the senior engineer of CPR&#x27;s western lines. The first proposal had been to extend the length of the climb, and thus reduce the gradient, by bypassing the town of Field at a higher level, on the south side of the Kicking Horse river valley. This idea had quickly been abandoned because of the severe risk of avalanches and landslips on the valley side. Also under consideration was the extension of the route in a horseshoe loop northwards, using both sides of the valley of the Yoho River to increase the distance, but again the valley sides were found to be prone to avalanches. It was the experience of severe disruption and delay caused by avalanches on other parts of the line (such as at the Rogers Pass station, which was destroyed by an avalanche in 1899) that persuaded Schwitzer that digging spiral tunnels was the only practical but expensive way forward.

The route decided upon called for two tunnels driven in three-quarter circles into the valley walls. The higher tunnel, &quot;number one&quot;, is in length and runs under Cathedral Mountain, to the south of the original track. When the new line emerges from this tunnel it has doubled back, running beneath itself and lower. It then descends the valley side in almost the opposite direction to its previous course before crossing the Kicking Horse River and entering Mount Ogden to the north. This lower tunnel, &quot;number two&quot;, is in length and the descent is again about 15 metres. From the exit of this tunnel the line continues down the valley in the original direction, towards Field. The constructions and extra track effectively double the length of the climb and reduce the ruling gradient to 2.2%. The new distance between Field and Wapta Lake, where the track levels out, is .

The contract was awarded to the Vancouver engineering firm of MacDonnell, Gzowski and Company and work started in 1907. The labour force amounted to about 1000 and the cost was about $1.5 million.

Regardless of the opening of the spiral tunnels, Field Hill remained a significant challenge and it was necessary to retain the powerful locomotives at Field locomotive depot. Even after the introduction of modern locomotives with dynamic braking and continuous pneumatic brakes, accidents were not eliminated. There were 64 derailments between Calgary and Field between 2004 and 2019.

On February 4, 2019, two of the three locomotives and 99 grain hopper railcars of westbound Canadian Pacific train 301 derailed at Mile 130.6, just outside of the western portal of Upper Spiral Tunnel. The three crew members were killed in the accident.

<text>Mitral regurgitation (MR), also known as mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence, is a form of valvular heart disease in which the mitral valve is insufficient and does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood. It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards – regurgitation from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts. Mitral regurgitation is the most common form of valvular heart disease.
==Definition==
Mitral regurgitation, also known as mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence, is the backward flow of blood from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, and into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, resulting in a systolic murmur radiating to the left armpit.

==Signs and symptoms==
Mitral regurgitation may be present for many years before any symptoms appear. The symptoms associated with MR are dependent on which phase of the disease process the individual is in. Individuals with acute MR are typically severely symptomatic and will have the signs and symptoms of acute decompensated congestive heart failure (i.e. shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). In acute cases, a murmur and tachycardia may be the only distinctive signs.

Individuals with chronic compensated MR may be asymptomatic for long periods of time, with a normal exercise tolerance and no evidence of heart failure. Over time, however, there may be decompensation and patients can develop volume overload (congestive heart failure). Symptoms of entry into a decompensated phase may include fatigue, shortness of breath particularly on exertion, and leg swelling. Also, there may be development of an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation.

Findings on clinical examination depend on the severity and duration of MR. The mitral component of the first heart sound is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat, often with heave. The first heart sound is followed by a high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the back or clavicular area. Its duration is, as the name suggests, the whole of systole. The loudness of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of regurgitation. It may be followed by a loud, palpable P2, heard best when lying on the left side. A third heart sound is commonly heard.

Patients with mitral valve prolapse may have a holosystolic murmur or often a mid-to-late systolic click and a late systolic murmur. Cases with a late systolic regurgitant murmur may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences.

Mitral regurgitation as a result of papillary muscle damage or rupture may be a complication of a heart attack and lead to cardiogenic shock.

==Cause==

The mitral valve apparatus comprises two valve leaflets, the mitral annulus, which forms a ring around the valve leaflets, and the papillary muscles, which tether the valve leaflets to the left ventricle and prevent them from prolapsing into the left atrium. The &quot;chordae tendineae&quot; is also present and connects the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles. Dysfunction of any of these portions of the mitral valve apparatus can cause regurgitation.

The most common cause of MR in developed countries is mitral valve prolapse. It is the most common cause of primary mitral regurgitation in the United States, causing about 50% of cases. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is more common in women as well as with advancing age, which causes a stretching of the leaflets of the valve and the chordae tendineae. Such elongation prevents the valve leaflets from fully coming together when the valve closes, causing the valve leaflets to prolapse into the left atrium, thereby causing MR.

Ischemic heart disease causes MR by the combination of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the left ventricle. This can lead to the subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.

Rheumatic fever (RF), Marfan&#x27;s syndrome and the Ehlers–Danlos syndromes are other typical causes. Mitral valve stenosis (MVS) can sometimes be a cause of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the sense that a stenotic valve (calcified and with restricted range of movement) allows backflow (regurgitation) if it is too stiff and misshapen to close completely. Most MVS is caused by RF, so one can say that MVS is sometimes the proximal cause of MI/MR (that is, stenotic MI/MR) and that RF is often the distal cause of MVS, MI/MR, or both. MR and mitral valve prolapse are also common in Ehlers–Danlos syndromes.

Secondary mitral regurgitation is due to the dilatation of the left ventricle that causes stretching of the mitral valve annulus and displacement of the papillary muscles. This dilatation of the left ventricle can be due to any cause of dilated cardiomyopathy including aortic insufficiency, nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Because the papillary muscles, chordae, and valve leaflets are usually normal in such conditions, it is also called functional mitral regurgitation.

Acute MR is most often caused by endocarditis, mainly &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Rupture or dysfunction of the papillary muscle are also common causes in acute cases, dysfunction, which can include mitral valve prolapse.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of MR can be broken into three phases of the disease process: the acute phase, the chronic compensated phase, and the chronic decompensated phase.
===Acute phase===
Acute MR (as may occur due to the sudden rupture of the chordae tendinae or papillary muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood that goes into the aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.

In the acute setting, the stroke volume of the left ventricle is increased (increased ejection fraction); this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart. However, as it progresses the LV volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates, thus leading to dysfunctional LV and a decrease in ejection fraction. The increase in stroke volume is explained by the Frank–Starling mechanism, in which increased ventricular pre-load stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forceful.

The regurgitant volume causes a volume overload and a pressure overload of the left atrium and the left ventricle. The increased pressures in the left side of the heart may inhibit drainage of blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and lead to pulmonary congestion.

===Chronic phase===

====Compensated====
If the MR develops slowly over months to years or if the acute phase cannot be managed with medical therapy, the individual will enter the chronic compensated phase of the disease. In this phase, the left ventricle develops eccentric hypertrophy in order to better manage the larger than normal stroke volume. The eccentric hypertrophy and the increased diastolic volume combine to increase the stroke volume (to levels well above normal) so that the forward stroke volume (forward cardiac output) approaches the normal levels.In the left atrium, the volume overload causes enlargement of the left atrium, allowing the filling pressure in the left atrium to decrease. This improves the drainage from the pulmonary veins, and signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion will decrease.

These changes in the left ventricle and left atrium improve the low forward cardiac output state and the pulmonary congestion that occur in the acute phase of the disease. Individuals in the chronic compensated phase may be asymptomatic and have normal exercise tolerances.

====Decompensated====
An individual may be in the compensated phase of MR for years, but will eventually develop left ventricular dysfunction, the hallmark for the chronic decompensated phase of MR. It is currently unclear what causes an individual to enter the decompensated phase of this disease. However, the decompensated phase is characterized by calcium overload within the cardiac myocytes.

In this phase, the ventricular myocardium is no longer able to contract adequately to compensate for the volume overload of mitral regurgitation, and the stroke volume of the left ventricle will decrease. The decreased stroke volume causes a decreased forward cardiac output and an increase in the end-systolic volume. The increased end-systolic volume translates to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and increased pulmonary venous congestion. The individual may again have symptoms of congestive heart failure.

The left ventricle begins to dilate during this phase. This causes a dilatation of the mitral valve annulus, which may worsen the degree of MR. The dilated left ventricle causes an increase in the wall stress of the cardiac chamber as well.While the ejection fraction is less in the chronic decompensated phase than in the acute phase or the chronic compensated phase, it may still be in the normal range (i.e.: &gt; 50 percent), and may not decrease until late in the disease course. A decreased ejection fraction in an individual with MR and no other cardiac abnormality should alert the physician that the disease may be in its decompensated phase.

==Diagnosis==
There are many diagnostic tests that have abnormal results in the presence of MR. These tests suggest the diagnosis of MR and may indicate to the physician that further testing is warranted. For instance, the electrocardiogram (ECG) in long-standing MR may show evidence of left atrial enlargement and left ventricular dilatation. Atrial fibrillation may also be noted on the ECG in individuals with chronic mitral regurgitation. The ECG may not show any of these findings in the setting of acute MR.
The quantification of MR usually employs imaging studies such as echocardiography or magnetic resonance angiography of the heart.

===Chest X-ray===
The chest X-ray in individuals with chronic MR is characterized by enlargement of the left atrium and the left ventricle, and then maybe calcification of the mitral valve.

===Echocardiogram===

An echocardiogram is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis of MR. Color doppler flow on the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will reveal a jet of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular systole. Also, it may detect a dilated left atrium and ventricle and decreased left ventricular function. A transesophageal echocardiogram can give clearer images if needed as the back of the heart can also be viewed.

===Electrocardiography===
P mitrale is a broad, bifid notched P wave in several or many leads with a prominent late negative component to the P wave in lead V1, and may be seen in MR, but also in mitral stenosis, and, potentially, any cause of overload of the left atrium.

===Quantification of mitral regurgitation===
The degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction, which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium.

:regurgitant fraction   =   formula_1

where Vmitral and Vaortic are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aortic valve during a cardiac cycle.
Methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI.The echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular diastole, and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve in ventricular systole. This method assumes that the aortic valve does not have aortic insufficiency.Another way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve. This is known as the regurgitant orifice area and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One particular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle, which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.


==Treatment==
The treatment of MR depends on the acuteness of the disease and whether there are associated signs of hemodynamic compromise. In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.

In acute MR secondary to a mechanical defect in the heart (i.e., rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae), the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery. If the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure, an intra-aortic balloon pump may be placed in order to improve perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of MR.

===Medicine===
If the individual with acute MR is normotensive, vasodilators may be of use to decrease the afterload seen by the left ventricle and thereby decrease the regurgitant fraction. The vasodilator most commonly used is nitroprusside.

Individuals with chronic MR can be treated with vasodilators as well to decrease afterload. In the chronic state, the most commonly used agents are ACE inhibitors and hydralazine. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of MR. The current guidelines for treatment of MR limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension, however. Any hypertension is treated aggressively, e.g. by diuretics and a low sodium diet. In both hypertensive and normotensive cases, digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated. Also, chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation.

===Surgery===
Surgery is curative of mitral valve regurgitation. There are two surgical options for the treatment of MR: mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair. Mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of 10 to 15 years, whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke. There are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair: resection of the prolapsed valvular segment (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Carpentier&quot; approach) and installation of artificial chordae to &quot;anchor&quot; the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle (sometimes referred to as the &quot;David&quot; approach). With the resection approach, any prolapsing tissue is resected, in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking. In the artificial chordae approach, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, or Gore-Tex) sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae, bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position, thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve. With both techniques, an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus, or opening of the mitral valve, to provide additional structural support. In some cases, the &quot;double orifice&quot; (or &#x27;Alfieri&#x27;) technique for mitral valve repair, the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle, leaving the two ends still able to open. This ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood, yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill the left ventricle with blood before it pumps. In general, mitral valve surgery requires &quot;open-heart&quot; surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heart-lung machine (cardiopulmonary bypass). This allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environment.

Due to the physiological stress associated with open-heart surgery, elderly and very sick patients may be subject to increased risk, and may not be candidates for this type of surgery. As a consequence, there are attempts to identify means of correcting MR on a beating heart. The Alfieri technique for instance, has been replicated using a percutaneous catheter technique, which installs a &quot;MitraClip&quot; device to hold the middle of the mitral valve closed.

Indications for surgery for chronic MR include signs of left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 60%, severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 50 mmHg at rest or 60 mmHg during activity, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.
==Epidemiology==
Significant mitral valve regurgitation has a prevalence of approximately 2% of the population, affecting males and females equally. It is one of the two most common valvular heart diseases in the elderly, and the commonest type of valvular heart disease in low and middle income countries.

In a study of 595 male elite football players aged 18–38 and 47 sedentary non-athletes, mitral regurgitation was found in 20% football players and 15% in control group. Football players with mitral regurgitation were found to have larger mitral annulus diameter compared to athletes without regurgitation, and left atrium diameter was larger in athletes with MR.

<text>The Medical University of [[Łódź]] was founded on October 1, 2002, as a merger of the Medical Academy of Łódź (founded January 1, 1950) and the Military Medical Academy of Łódź (founded July 1, 1958).
It is the largest teaching hospital unit in Poland and a European research center.

== Structure ==

It comprises
*6 research institutes,
*49 chairs,
*7 fully equipped university teaching hospitals with a total capacity of &quot;2900 beds&quot;, as well as
*438,000 specialist consultations every year in &quot;specialist outpatient clinics&quot;, in addition to the
*collaboration with 22 international universities.

== Aspect ==
At the Medical University of Lodz, students are instructed from a 250 plus Basic Science and Clinical Medicine Faculty, composed of physicians, teachers and researchers. Most faculty members of the university hold a dual MD/PhD degree, and all are board certified in their respective specialties.

<doc id="869505" wikidata="Q965481" url="?curid=869505" title="Communist Party (Sweden)">
<text>The Communist Party (, K) is a Marxist–Leninist political party in Sweden started in 1970. From 1970 to 1977, it was known as the Communist League Marxist–Leninists (Revolutionaries) (, KFML(r)) and from 1977 to 2004 as the Communist Party Marxist–Leninists (Revolutionaries) (, KPML(r)). At the 14th Party Congress held in Gothenburg in January 2005, it was decided to change the name to the current one.

KFML(r) was unofficially founded in 1970 by a splinter group from the pro-Chinese KFML, which in turn had split from the Eurocommunist Left Party in 1967. &quot;The (r)s&quot; (&quot;(r)-arna&quot;) considered that KFML had approached reformism and was not a genuine workers&#x27; movement. In 1970, it began publishing the weekly &quot;Proletären&quot; (&quot;The Proletarian&quot;), and the group was officially registered as a political party in 1977. During the 1980s, KPML(r) achieved representation in some municipalities, including Gothenburg, Sweden&#x27;s second-largest city. The Gothenburg region has always been the strongest area for the party, partly because the party was started there. During the period of 1970 to 1999, the party chairman was Frank Baude. Baude was succeeded by Anders Carlsson, who held the post as chairman between 1999 and 2014. Between 2014 and 2019, Robert Mathiasson was the chairman of the party, he was succeeded by Ulf Nilsson, who only led the party for a short time. Ulf Nilsson resigned as party chairman in January 2020. On the Communist Party&#x27;s 19th congress in September 2020, Povel Johansson was elected new chairman.

Its members and sympathisers includes, or included, several Swedish celebrities such as actors Sven Wollter, Lasse Brandeby and Kent Andersson and musicians Ken, Totta Näslund and Fred Åkerström, all of whom have participated in events and gatherings arranged by the party.

==Youth organisations==
In the early days of the party, the pro-KFML(r) fractions of the United FNL Groups (DFFG) and of the Swedish Clarté League broke away and set up the Solidarity Front for the People of Indochina and Clarté (m-l) respectively. In 1972, these two structures were dissolved and merged into the Young Communist League of Sweden (Marxist-Leninists) (&quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Ungdomsförbund (marxist-leninisterna)&quot;, SKU (ml)), the new KFML(r) youth wing. Later a new students organisation, SKS (ml), was formed. Both SKU (ml) and SKS (ml) were disbanded towards the end of the 1970s as the party itself consisted mainly of young people.

In 1994, the party again launched a youth organization, Revolutionary Communist Youth (RKU).

==International relations==
The party upholds close relations with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Communist Party of the Philippines, the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium, the Communist Party of Greece, the Polisario Front and others.

During the North Korean famine, the party participated in charity fundraising for the delivery of humanitarian aid to North Korea. As a result, the party developed a degree of collaboration with the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, although this cooperation did not persist to the present day.
==Illegal surveillance by the Swedish Security Service==

In 1969, governmental registration of an individual&#x27;s political affiliation was made illegal in Sweden. However, in 2003 it was revealed that the Swedish Security Service (Säpo) already in 1970 had been secretly instructed by the Swedish government to continue surveillance of &quot;key individuals&quot; in some twenty organisations on the far-left and far-right of Swedish politics in spite of that ban. This surveillance continued until 1998. KFML(r)/KPML(r) and its associated organisations were among those put under such surveillance. When the files were made public, they revealed that the number of surveilled individuals of the party ranged from 2,012 in 1985 to 1,346 in 1998, which meant that almost all party members had been under surveillance.

==Electoral results==
The party does not participate in elections to the national nor the European Parliaments. It does not participate in the national elections due to financial and tactical reasons whereas it advocates boycott of the European parliament elections. However, it does participate in the municipal elections in some Swedish municipalities. In 2010, the party participated in the elections in 18 municipalities, which is the largest number of municipalities so far. Its electoral results have fluctuated over time, with high results in various cities during the late 1990s (second-largest party in Karlshamn, for example). In the three most recent elections, the party has lost ground electorally.

<text>James Emilius Broome (December 15, 1808 – November 23, 1883) was an American politician who served as the third governor of Florida from 1853 to 1857.

== Early life and career ==

Broome was born in Hamburg, South Carolina and moved to Florida in 1837. He engaged in the mercantile business until he retired in 1841. In that same year, Governor Richard Keith Call appointed him to the position of Probate Judge of Leon County. He served in that position until 1848.

== Political life ==

He was elected governor in 1852. A Democrat, he took office on October 3, 1853. He was an early States&#x27;-Righter. During his term, the Whig Party, the opposition to the Democrats at the time, controlled the Florida State Legislature. He vetoed so many of the bills that were passed by the legislature that he became known as the &quot;Veto Governor&quot;. His gubernatorial stint ended on October 5, 1857. Broome served as a member of the Florida Senate in 1861. A large planter, he was very sympathetic to the Confederate cause.

== Marriages ==

James E. Broome was married five times. In 1865, he moved to New York City. On a visit with his son in DeLand, Florida, Broome died in 1883.

<doc id="869517" wikidata="Q14158629" url="?curid=869517" title="The Normal">
<text>The Normal is the recording artist name used by English music producer Daniel Miller, a film editor at the time, who is best known as the founder of the record label Mute Records.

==Background==
In 1977, Miller had split up with his girlfriend. A friend suggested that he read a book the friend himself had just finished. The book was &quot;Crash&quot; (1973) by J. G. Ballard. He felt that Ballard&#x27;s writing took him five minutes into the future; the novel was to be a major influence in the music he would produce as The Normal.
Miller was disillusioned by the fact you needed to learn three chords to be in a punk band, so he decided to purchase a synthesiser. His thinking was that you only needed to learn to press one key on a synthesiser. After buying a Korg 700s synthesiser from Macari&#x27;s music shop in London, Miller recorded and released a single under the name &quot;The Normal&quot;. This was &quot;T.V.O.D.&quot;/&quot;Warm Leatherette&quot;. Both tracks were minimalist electronic songs influenced by the &quot;Crash&quot; novel. He wanted the sound of the recordings to be visual, like driving along a highway between large buildings then going through a tunnel.
The single was recorded in Daniel Miller&#x27;s house using a TEAC four track tape recorder and the Korg miniKORG 700S synthesiser.

&quot;Live at West Runton Pavilion&quot;, The Normal&#x27;s second release, done with another Mute Records act, Robert Rental, was not well received. A strange release, it was a one-sided album (side two was left blank) of improvised electronic noises, in a plain purple dust jacket. Marat Records released the record in Germany as &quot;Daniel Miller Robert Rental Live&quot;, with a black and white picture sleeve, catalogue No. Marat Rough 017.

==Influence on other artists==
Songs by The Normal have been covered and performed by many notable artists such as Grace Jones, Sleep Chamber, Laibach, Chicks on Speed/Hell on a split-7&quot;, Giddle and Boyd Rice and in 2006 by Trent Reznor with Jeordie White and Peter Murphy.
&quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; was performed live by Duran Duran in November 2007 as part of an electro medley during their 2008 tour, in support of their album &quot;Red Carpet Massacre&quot;.

<text>Karl Friedrich Otto Wolff (13 May 1900 – 17 July 1984) was a senior German SS officer who served as Chief of Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS (Heinrich Himmler) and an SS liaison to Adolf Hitler during World War II. He ended the war as the Supreme SS and Police Leader in occupied Italy and helped arrange for the early surrender of Axis forces in that theatre, effectively ending the war there several days sooner than in the rest of Europe. He escaped prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials as a result of his participation in Operation Sunrise. 
In 1962, Wolff was rearrested, prosecuted in West Germany for the deportation of Polish Jews, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to murder in 1964. He was released in 1971 and died 13 years later.

==Early life and career==
Karl Friedrich Otto Wolff was born the son of a wealthy district court judge in Darmstadt on 13 May 1900. During World War I he graduated from school in 1917, volunteered to join the Imperial German Army (&quot;Leibgarde-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 115&quot;), and served on the Western Front. He rose to the rank of lieutenant and was awarded both the Iron Cross second class and first class.

After the war, Wolff was forced to leave the army because of the reduction of the German armed forces following the terms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Wolff was in the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; from December 1918 to May 1920. He started a two-year apprenticeship at the Bethmann Bank in Frankfurt and married Frieda von Römheld in 1923. The couple moved to Munich, where Wolff worked for Deutsche Bank. In June 1924, he was laid off and joined a public relations firm. Wolff may also have studied law, but never took any state exams. In 1925, he started his own public relations company which he operated in Munich until 1933.

==Nazi Party and SS==
Wolff joined the Nazi Party with card number 695,131 and the SS in October 1931. His SS membership number was 14,235 and he was commissioned as an SS-&quot;Sturmführer&quot; in February 1932.

From March 1933, after the Nazi Party had obtained national power, Wolff served as an adjutant to Franz Ritter von Epp, then-governor of Bavaria. Here he came to the attention of the head of the SS Heinrich Himmler who appointed Wolff his personal adjutant in June 1933. In 1936 Wolff became a member of the Reichstag. The same year Himmler named him chief of Personal Staff Reichsführer-SS to coordinate all contact and correspondence within the SS at both party and state levels.

By managing Himmler&#x27;s affairs with the SS, the Nazi Party, state agencies and personnel, the eloquent and well mannered Wolff rose to become one of the key figures in Himmler&#x27;s power regime. In addition, Wolff oversaw the economic investments made by the SS, was responsible for saving funds among Himmler&#x27;s circle of friends and for connections to the SS organizations Ahnenerbe and Lebensborn. In 1939 he retroactively became head of the Main Office and SS liaison officer to Hitler. In 1936, Wolff left the Protestant Church. On 30 January 1937, he was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; (major general).

==World War II==

As was later revealed in the 1964 trial, during the early part of the Second World War, Wolff served as &quot;Himmler&#x27;s eyes and ears&quot; in Hitler&#x27;s headquarters. He would have been aware of significant events or could easily have access to the relevant information. Apart from the information passing across his desk, Wolff received (as Chief of Himmler&#x27;s Personal Staff) copies of all letters from SS officers, and his friends at this point included Odilo Globocnik, the organiser of Operation Reinhard (in effect 1941 to 1943). Wolff&#x27;s later denial of knowledge of Holocaust activities may be plausible only at the detailed level, but not of the extent of atrocities by the Nazi regime.

Incriminating letters show that Wolff was involved in the Holocaust. On 8 September 1939, shortly after the invasion of Poland, Wolff wrote to the Gestapo office in Frankfurt (Oder) and ordered the immediate &quot;arrest of all male Jews of Polish nationality and their family members&quot; and the confiscation of any wealth. In 1942 Wolff oversaw the deportation transports during &quot;Grossaktion Warschau&quot;, the mass extermination of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto. When rail-transport bottlenecks occurred, Wolff communicated repeatedly with Reich Railway Director Albert Ganzenmüller. In a letter sent from the Führer Headquarters, dated 13 August 1942 and referring to transports of Jews to Treblinka extermination camp, Wolff thanked Ganzenmüller for his assistance:

According to Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, in August 1941, Himmler and Wolff attended the shooting of Jews at Minsk which had been organized by Arthur Nebe, who was in command of &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot;, a mobile killing unit.
 Nauseated and shaken by the experience, Himmler decided that alternative methods of killing should be found. On Himmler&#x27;s orders, by the spring of 1942, the camp at Auschwitz had been greatly expanded, including by the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.

After the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in June 1942, Wolff developed a strong rivalry with other SS leaders, particularly with Heydrich&#x27;s successor at the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; or &quot;RSHA&quot;), Ernst Kaltenbrunner, and with Walter Schellenberg of the foreign intelligence service in the RSHA. His position was weakened by his frequent absences from Berlin, in part due to his suffering from pyelitis and renal calculus (kidney stones), which required surgery. Wolff fell out of favour with Himmler and was dismissed as his chief of staff. In April 1943, he was relieved of his duties as liaison officer to Hitler. Himmler announced he would temporarily take over Wolff&#x27;s duties. A new replacement as liaison officer to Hitler&#x27;s HQ did not occur until the appointment of Hermann Fegelein, who assumed the duty in January 1944. Wolff had particularly angered Himmler by his divorce and remarriage in March 1943. Himmler, who believed the family to be the nucleus of the SS, had denied Wolff permission to divorce, but Wolff had turned directly to Hitler. Himmler still appears to have considered Wolff a loyal member of the SS, for in September 1943 Wolff was transferred to Italy as Supreme SS and Police Leader.

In that position, Wolff shared responsibility for standard police-functions such as security, maintenance of prisons, supervision of concentration camps, and forced-labor camps - as well as the deportation of forced laborers with Wilhelm Harster, who was the Commander in Chief of the Security Police. When Wolff became Plenipotentiary General of the German Wehrmacht in July 1944, he also became responsible for anti-partisan warfare in occupied Italy. By now Wolff commanded the police and the entire rear army in Italy. So far Wolff&#x27;s involvement in war crimes in Italy remains largely unclear, partially because source material on the degree to which SS units participated in Nazi security warfare is lacking. Although it seems as if US investigators were in possession of incriminating material in 1945 that indicated Wolff&#x27;s approval of the executions that became known as the Ardeatine massacre, this evidence was deemed not sufficient for criminal charges. On 9 December 1944, Wolff was awarded the German Cross in Gold for using Italian units, with secondary German units, to destroy partisans and for the &quot;maintenance of war production in the Italian territory&quot;. During this period he approved the project of the Marnate&#x27;s Bunker, close to the German command of Olgiate Olona. By 1945 Wolff was acting military commander of Italy.

In 1945, Wolff, under Operation Sunrise, took over command and management of intermediaries (including the Swiss Intelligence officer, Captain Max Waibel) in order to make contact in Switzerland with the regional headquarters of the US Office of Strategic Services, under Allen W. Dulles, with a view to the surrender of German forces in and around Italy. After meetings in Zurich on 8 March 1945
and in Ascona on 19 March 1945
and a diplomatic standoff in Lucerne (23 to 25 April 1945)
Wolff negotiated the surrender of all German forces in Italy (signed 29 April 1945, effective 2 May 1945), before the war in Europe officially ended with the surrender of Germany signed on 8 May 1945. Wolff&#x27;s capitulation of Italy to the Allies upset the plans of Admiral Karl Dönitz (German President from 30 April 1945) who envisaged a staged series of surrenders designed to give German troops and refugees more time to make their way west.

==Trials and conviction==
Arrested on 13 May 1945, he was imprisoned in Schöneberg. During the Nuremberg trials, Wolff was allowed to escape prosecution because of his early capitulation in Italy and by appearing as a witness for the prosecution at trial. Although released in 1947, he had been indicted by the post-war German government as part of the denazification process. Detained under house arrest, after a German trial, Wolff was sentenced to 5 years in prison in November 1948, for his membership in the SS. In June 1949, he was released from prison after his sentence was reduced to 4 years. After his release, Wolff worked as an executive for an advertising agency.

He took up residence with his family in Starnberg. In 1962, during the trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann, evidence showed that Wolff had organized the deportation of Italian Jews in 1944. Wolff was arrested and put on trial in West Germany. In 1964, he was convicted of deporting 300,000 Jews to the Treblinka extermination camp, which led to their murders. Sentenced to 15 years in prison in Straubing, Wolff served only part of his sentence and was released in 1971 following a heart attack.

==Later life==
After his release, Wolff retired to Austria. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Wolff returned to public life, frequently lecturing on the internal workings of the SS and his relationship with Himmler. After his release from prison in 1971 he appeared in television documentaries including &quot;The World At War&quot; saying that he witnessed an execution of twenty or thirty partisan prisoners in Minsk in 1941 with Himmler.
In the early 1970s, Wolff promoted the theory of an alleged plot to kidnap Pope Pius XII. Most other allegations of such a plot are based on a 1972 document written by Wolff that &quot;Avvenire d&#x27;Italia&quot; published in 1991, and on personal interviews with Wolff before his death in 1984. Wolff maintained that on 13 September 1943, Hitler gave the directive to &quot;occupy Vatican City, secure its files and art treasures, and take the Pope and Curia to the north&quot;. Hitler allegedly did not want the Pope to &quot;fall into the hands of the Allies&quot;.

Wolff&#x27;s reliability has been questioned by Holocaust historians, such as István Deák, a professor of history at Columbia University. Reviewing &quot;A Special Mission&quot; by Dan Kurzman, a promoter of the theory, Deák noted Kurzman&#x27;s &quot;credulity&quot; and that the latter &quot;uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made to him by his principal German interlocutor, the former SS General Karl Wolff&quot;. He further criticized the book&#x27;s &quot;modest documentation&quot; containing &quot;a great number of vague or inaccurate references&quot;.

In the late 1970s Wolff also became involved with &quot;Stern&quot; journalist Gerd Heidemann. Together with Heidemann, he travelled through South America, where he helped to locate, among others, Klaus Barbie and Walter Rauff, with whom Heidemann conducted interviews for a series of articles. Wolff served as a consultant for the alleged Hitler Diaries and was upset when they turned out to be forgeries by Konrad Kujau. Asked to attend the trial of Heidemann and Kujau, Wolff declined.

==Personal life and death==

On 17 July 1984, Wolff died in a hospital in Rosenheim. He was buried in the cemetery at Prien am Chiemsee on 21 July.

A few weeks before his death, Wolff had declared the Islamic profession of faith, becoming a Muslim. At his grave, his daughter Fatima Grimm gave the funeral prayer in the presence of representatives of the Islamic Center of Munich (ICM). She was also a Muslim convert, doing so in 1960 while in Munich, later becoming a translator, author and speaker on Islam in Germany.

<doc id="869534" wikidata="Q5422417" url="?curid=869534" title="Extreme points of Eurasia">
<text>The extreme points of [[Eurasia]] are farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the continent. Some of these locations are open to debate, owing to the diverse definitions of Europe and Asia.

Mainland Eurasia is entirely located within the northern hemisphere and mostly within the eastern hemisphere, yet it touches the western hemisphere on both extremes. Thus, both the easternmost and westernmost points of Eurasia are in the western hemisphere. Mainland Eurasia crosses 200° of longitude and 76° of latitude north to south.

==Extremes of Eurasia, including islands==

* Northernmost Point — Cape Fligeli, Rudolf Island, Franz Josef Land, Russia (81°50&#x27;N, 59°14&#x27;E)
* Southernmost Point — Dana Island, Rote Ndao, Indonesia (11°00&#x27;S, 122°52&#x27;E)
** When Cocos (Keeling) Islands included as part of Southeast Asia, then South Island (12°11&#x27;22&quot;S, 96°54&#x27;22&quot;E)
*Westernmost point —Monchique Islet, Flores Island, Azores Islands, Portugal (39°29′42.8″N, 31°16′30″W)
* Easternmost point — Big Diomede, Russia (65°46&#x27;N, 169°03&#x27;W). The International Date Line runs between the Russian Big Diomede and the neighbouring U.S.-governed Little Diomede.

==Extremes of the Eurasian mainland==

* Northernmost Point — Cape Chelyuskin, Russia (77°44&#x27;N, 104°15&#x27;E)
* Southernmost Point — Tanjung Piai, Malaysia (1°15&#x27;N, 103°30&#x27;E)
* Westernmost Point — Cabo da Roca, Portugal (38°46&#x27;N, 9°29&#x27;W)
* Easternmost Point — Cape Dezhnev, Russia (66°4&#x27;N, 169°39&#x27;W)

==Other==
* Highest altitude: — Mount Everest, Nepal and China — 
* Lowest point on dry land: — The shore of the Dead Sea, Palestine and Jordan, below sea level. &quot;See List of places on land with elevations below sea level.&quot;
* Farthest from the ocean: — A place near Hoxtolgay in China () from the nearest coastline. &quot;See Pole of inaccessibility.&quot;

<doc id="869535" wikidata="Q1787940" url="?curid=869535" title="Communist Party of Sweden (1967)">
<text>Kommunistiska Förbundet Marxist-Leninisterna (; KFML; ) was formed at the 1967 party congress of VPK, when a pro-Chinese group left the party.

==Party history==
===1967–1980===

KFML was oriented towards the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Marxism–Leninism as interpreted by Mao Zedong, commonly known as Maoism. KFML was the first of the many New Left-groups that surged in Sweden during the 1960s and 1970s. KFML had a very important and leading role in the mass solidarity work with the Vietnamese people.

In 1970, a left wing faction based in Gothenburg broke away and formed KFML(r).

In 1973, KFML took the name Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (Communist Party of Sweden), the old party name of VPK. SKP held its first party congress January 4–7, 1973. The second party congress was held in Gustavsberg April 15–19, 1976.

In 1980, SKP suffered another split, when a group of critics were expelled on the issue of China. The expelled formed a new party, &quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (Marxist-Leninisterna)&quot;.

===1980s===

The 1980s meant crisis for SKP. They were divided on the issue of the new leadership in China, effectively under Deng Xiaoping. Vietnam, which had meant so much in the solidarity work of KFML/SKP, and Cambodia, &quot;their&quot; ally, had become involved in the Cambodian-Vietnamese War, fighting against each other. And SKP, who had succeeded in getting famous in Swedish politics, had not been able to expand and get more than fractions of a percent in votes. From 1982 and onwards, they supported the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the national elections. Many members, both leaders and base militants left the movement. The party became seriously ideologically disoriented.

The 4th congress of the party was held June 16–17, 1984. Roland Pettersson was elected chairman.

In the 1985 general election, the party won representation in the municipal councils in Gällivare (1 seat), Mariestad (2 seats), Vallentuna (1 seat), Laxå, Vadstena and Sigtuna (2 seats).

At the 5th congress of the party (October 31 – November 2, 1986) SKP changed its name to Solidaritetspartiet (The Solidarity Party), and adopted a non-communist programme. The new name was registered on November 28. It is probable that the name was inspired by the Polish Solidarity movement under Lech Wałęsa, as the party supported their struggle. There was a small section who wanted to keep the old name. There were also other, alternative proposals, such as &quot;Demokratiska Socialister&quot; (the runner-up proposal), &quot;Sveriges Socialistiska Vänsterparti&quot; and &quot;Sveriges Revolutionära Socialister&quot;. The name of the party publication was changed to &quot;Solidaritets-Gnistan&quot; and became a triweekly. The Mariestad branch of the party, which had municipal representation, broke with the and formed Municipal Left. The Mariestad branch had objected to the decision by the congress to remove the ban on local organizations to receive government financing.
The 5th congress elected the following central committee:
* Jan-Olof Norell (chairman)
* Inga Allard
* Björn Fredriksson
* Tomas Jonsson
* Tomas Junkka
* Göran Lundin
* Lars-Åke Lönn
* Lisa Norman
* Lars Ströman
* Pia Ryberg
* Sanna Vestin
* Göran Wicksell

In the 1988 general election, the party contested the municipal elections in Sigtuna and Vallentuna. In Laxå party took part in the elections as Municipal Left (&quot;Kommunal Vänster&quot;), on the list &quot;&quot;VPK/Kommunal Vänster&quot; a cooperation between the party and VPK. In Katrineholm, the party contested on the list of &quot;VPK-Kommunal Vänster&quot;, together with VPK, SP and independents. In Hammarö it contested on the list of &quot;Vänsterpartiet Kommunisterna/Kommunal Vänster&quot;&quot;. In Gällivare the party contested on the lists of United Socialists.

In Vallentuna the vore-share increased from 414 to 596 (4.7%). The party got two seats, and Norell and Wicksell became municipal councillors. In Sigtuna the seat of the party was retained, and the vote-share increased from 300 to 350. The party lost its municipal representation in Gällivare. &quot;VPK/Kommunal Vänster&quot; won five seats in Laxå. In Hammarö &quot;VPK/Kommunal Vänster&quot; won three seats. &quot;VPK-Kommunal Vänster&quot; failed to win any seat in Katrineholm.

===Decline to obscurity===
Ahead of the party congress on November 4–5, 1989 the central committee had proposed that the party be disbanded. By this time the party had only a handful of functioning local units, and there was a strong trend towards dissolving the national organization and let the local units continue to function on the municipal left in cooperation with other forces. The congress did however not approve that suggestion. The congress also decided that &quot;Solidaritets-Gnistan&quot; would cease to function as an external publication. The congress elected the following central committee:
* Jan-Olof Norell (chairman)
* Inga Allard
* Christin Almgren
* Leif Franzén
* Björn Fredriksson
* Tomas Jonsson
* Pia Ryberg
* Lars Ströman
* Anna-Maria Valladolid
* Göran Wicksell
* Sanna Vestin

In the new central committee, 4 out of 11 members came from Vallentuna. The congress also decided that another congress would convene in the summer of 1990 to decide the future of the party.

The last issue of &quot;Solidaritets-Gnistan&quot; was published on December 13, 1989.

By 1990, the party ceased to function as a nationwide party. The party transformed into an entirely municipal party in Vallentuna. Solidaritetspartiet ran in the municipal elections in Vallentuna until 1994, when they got 6% and 3 seats. They did not run in the 1998 elections.

==Youth wing==
Initially Clarté functioned as the youth and students wing of the party. Later &quot;Röd Ungdom&quot; (Red Youth, RU) was founded as the youth league of SKP. It published a magazine called Rödluvan (Little Red Ridinghood).

RU held its fourth congress on April 24–25, 1982. Notably the congress opposed the party line of voting in favour of the Social Democrats in the upcoming elections. Instead the youth wing appealed for blank voting. A resolution adopted by the congress read &quot;...none of the parliamentary parties will fix the future of the Swedish youth. The future is decided by the organisation and struggle of the youth&quot;. A three-member delegation of the SKP party leadership was present at the congress, but were unable to convince RU to support the party line.

RU held a fifth, extraordinary, congress in 1983. By that time the youth wing was in bad shape. Representatives from 15 local units took part in the congress. The congress approved the merger of MLK into RU.

At the time of the 1988 elections youth group was formed in Vallentuna, Solidarity Party Youth League (SPUF).

<doc id="869540" wikidata="Q235004" url="?curid=869540" title="Vigan">
<text>Vigan, officially the City of Vigan (; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Ilocos Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 53,935 people.

Located on the western coast of the large island of Luzon, facing the West Philippine Sea, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it is one of the few Spanish colonial towns left in the Philippines whose old structures have mostly remained intact. It is well known for its sett pavements and a unique architecture of the Spanish Philippines colonial era which fuses native Philippine and Oriental building designs and construction, with colonial Spanish architecture that is still abundant in the area, mainly the bahay na bato houses and an Earthquake Baroque church.

Former Philippine president Elpidio Quirino, the sixth president of the Philippines, was born in Vigan, at the former location of the Provincial Jail (his father was a warden). He also resided in the Syquia Mansion, which is a wedding gift of his in-laws to his wife. The entire city of Vigan was later inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage City after being declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities (OWHC).

In May 2015, Vigan was officially recognized as one of the New7Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and La Paz. New7Wonders Foundation president and founding member Bernard Weber led a ceremony held at St. Paul Cathedral where he handed a bronze plaque to former Vigan Mayor Eva Grace Singson-Medina, signifying the heritage city&#x27;s election as one of the world&#x27;s wonder cities.

==Etymology==
The area of Vigan was originally a settlement of traders coming from the Fujian Province, China. At the time of Spanish colonisation, the Chinese settlers, whose language was Southern Min (Min Nan, often referred to as &quot;Hokkien&quot; by most Filipinos), referred to the area as &quot;Bee Gan&quot; (), which means &quot;Beautiful Shore.&quot; Since the Spanish settlers interchanged V and the B to refer to the /b/ sound, they spelled the Hokkien Chinese name &quot;Bee Gan&quot; as &quot;Vigan&quot;, which is the name used to this day.

Vigan&#x27;s Chinese heritage is still evident from the numerous elite Chinese creole families who come from the area, many of whom adopted Hispanic family names. Others, such as the Syquia family, have retained Chinese-derived surnames. However all of the Chinese creole families are Christian and adopted the Hispanic culture themselves.

Another commonly known source of the city&#x27;s name is from the Bigaa plant that once grew abundantly along the banks of the Mestizo River, from which captain Juan de Salcedo derived the city&#x27;s name (after a misunderstanding with the locals, thinking he was asking the name of the plants).

===Other names===
The city&#x27;s full name at the time of its Spanish foundation was &quot;Villa Fernandina&quot;, or &quot;Town of Ferdinand&quot;, in honor of Prince Ferdinand, the firstborn son of King Philip II of Spain. As the city grew, and the seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia transferred to Vigan, it was later renamed &quot;Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan&quot; (&quot;Ferdinand&#x27;s City of Vigan/Fernandine City of Vigan&quot;).

==History==
===Pre-Colonial Era===
Due to silting of the Mestizo River, Vigan is no longer separated from the mainland, therefore no longer an island. The city is unique in the Philippines because it is one of many extensive surviving Philippine historic cities, dating back to the 16th century.

Vigan was a coastal trading post long before the Spaniards arrived; Chinese traders sailing from the South China Sea came to &quot;Isla de Vigan&quot; (Island of Vigan) via the Mestizo River that surrounded it. On board their ships were seafaring merchants who came to trade goods from other Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax, and other mountain products brought by the indigenous peoples from the Cordillera region.

===Spanish Colonial Era===
In the book &quot;The Philippine Island&quot; (Vol. III, p. 276, Blair and Robertson) two letters from Governor-General Guido de Lavezaris to King Philip II of Spain mention: &quot;It seemed best to send Captain Juan de Salcedo with 70 or 80 soldiers to explore the coast of Los Ilocanos on the shores of the river called Bigan.&quot; The Spaniards led by Salcedo marched north from Manila on May 20, 1572. They arrived in Vigan on June 13, 1572.

====Villa Fernandina de Vigan====
Thus, after the successful expedition and the exploration of the North, Juan de Salcedo founded &quot;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot; in honor of King Philip II&#x27;s son, Prince Ferdinand, who died at the age of four. From Vigan, Salcedo rounded the tip of Luzón and proceeded to pacify Camarines, Albay, and Catanduanes. As a reward for his services to the King of Spain, Salcedo was awarded the old province of Ilocos, which consisted of the modern provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, La Union and part of Mountain Province as his hacienda (estate), and was accorded the title of &quot;Justicia Mayor de esta Provincia de Ylocos&quot; (Province Mayor of Ilocos).

In 1574, Salcedo returned to the capital of his &quot;encomienda&quot; (trusteeship), Vigan, bringing with him his soldiers and some Augustinian missionaries to pioneer the evangelization of the Ilocos region. He established a Spanish city for the purpose of controlling the neighboring country.

Governor General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, in his account of &quot;encomienda&quot; dated in Manila on May 31, 1591, states: &quot;The town of Vigan called &quot;Villa Fernandina&quot; consisted of Spanish settlers; a priest; a Justice Alcalde Mayor (Governor); and a Deputy. The King collects 800 tributes (equivalent to 3,200 subjects).&quot; During this period, Vigan was composed of 19 &quot;barrio&quot;s (districts).

Between 1645 and 1660, Vigan was divided into 21 &quot;Cabezas de Barrio&quot; (Town Mayors) as mentioned in the &quot;Libro de Casamiento&quot; (Book of Marriage); from the records of the parish house of Vigan found in its archives. Separated from the indigenous population, the Chinese migrants were residents in a neighbourhood called El Pariancillo, los Sangleyes del parian (The Sangleyes of the Parian); and the Spanish settlers were residents in a town called &quot;Los Españoles de la Villa&quot; (The Town Spaniards). The Spaniards consisted of about 60 Spanish Households. The region of Ilocos where Vigan is located is also recorded to have had 631 mixed Spanish-Filipino families. It also had 44,852 native families.

====Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan====
In 1755, Bp. Juan de la Fuente Yepes made a request to the King Fernando VI to move the Diocese of Nueva Segovia to Villa Fernandina due to the deteriorating status of Lal-lo. In 1758, with the Royal Decree signed by Fernando VI, Villa Fernadina became Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan and the See of Nueva Segovia was transferred from Lal-lo, Cagayan. The bell ensconced within the belfry of Vigan, has the imprinted words of the decree. Wherever the clang of the bell reaches, it marks the territory of Ciudad Fernandina de Vigan. In 1849, Leona Florentino, the mother of Philippine women&#x27;s literature, was born in Vigan.

===Philippine Revolution and American Occupation===
During the Philippine Revolution, revolutionary forces under Manuel Tinio, supported by the Ilocano rebels, attacked and defeated the Spanish colonial forces and captured the city in the Siege of Vigan. During the Philippine–American War, American forces led by Commander McCracken and Lt. Col. James Parker occupied the town in November 1899.

===World War II===
At the start of World War II, Vigan was one of the first places in the Philippines invaded by Japan on December 10, 1941. In 1945, combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops, aided by Ilocano resistance fighters, defeated the Japanese Imperial forces and liberated Vigan.

====UNESCO World Heritage City====
In 1999, Vigan was listed by UNESCO as the best preserved example of Spanish colonial towns in Asia. Its architecture is the conglomeration of cultural elements from the Philippines, China, and Spain, making it unique in the world.

===Recent history===

==== Cityhood ====

On December 27, 2000, then President Joseph Estrada signed Republic Act No. 8988, that &quot;revalidated and recognized&quot; Vigan&#x27;s city status granted by virtue of the Royal Decree of September 7, 1757, issued by Ferdinand VI, King of Spain. This legislation serves as Vigan&#x27;s present city charter. The charter did not provide a clause for a plebiscite and the law took effect in January 2001.

==== New7Wonders ====
On December 7, 2014, Vigan was named as one of the &quot;New7Wonders Cities&quot;.

==== 2022 Luzon earthquake ====

On July 27, 2022, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck parts of Luzon, damaging the city&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage sites including the Vigan Cathedral and old-century houses, as well as few power lines toppled along Calle Crisologo.

==Geography==

Vigan is situated in the northern part of Luzon, the Philippines’ largest island. It serves as the capital of Ilocos Sur and has been a major political and trading center since before the Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines.

It is away from Manila, away from Laoag City, and away from San Fernando, La Union, the regional capital of Ilocos Region.

===Topography===
Its of land consists mostly of plains with gentle hills. Its boundaries on the north, east, south, and west are the municipalities of Bantay, Santa, Caoayan, and Santa Catalina, respectively. The South China Sea is on its southwest portion.

Majority of its land, 60 percent of it, is used for agriculture. Around 32 percent is made up of residential area, nearly three percent are for commercial and industrial use, and around one percent is for institutional purposes. There are also forest reserves and fishponds included in Vigan&#x27;s land area.

Vigan is made up of 39 barangays. Thirty of them are classified as rural, but they occupy only 2,366 hectares. The remaining nine are classified as &quot;poblacion&quot; barangays and are together 144.75 hectares big.

The barangays of Pagburnayan, Paoa, and Tamag are on the area of rolling plains. On the other hand, portions of Barangays Tamag and the barangays of Bulala and Salindeg are found on the city&#x27;s hilly parts.

Its most dominant hill feature is the Vigan Gap Hill in the eastern part, just 10 kilometers away from the city. Vigan used to be separated from the rest of the mainland by the rivers of Abra, Mestizo and Govantes, making it an island during that time. The Govantes River cuts the current Vigan plain from North to South.

The large Abra and Mestizo rivers, together with the rivers of Bantay, Bantaoay, Nauman and Santo Tomas serve as part of a network that drain the Vigan plains. These rivers are not only important in safekeeping the city from floods, they also served as important ways of transport for trade-related activities from the 15th century to the 19th century, that helped make Vigan a thriving center. The most vital of these rivers is said to be the Mestizo River which was used by the small vessels to transport goods and people.

There is a faulting trend in the Vigan plain that ends in Santa Catalina.

===Soil type===
The land area of Vigan is generally flat. Slopes of 20 are found at Barangay V, Tamag, and Paoa. There are no forest reserves in the city in terms of potential and raw materials. Bamboo is the only forest product in Vigan.

There are five soil types in the city. First, the &quot;Bantay Loam&quot;, located at the southern portion of Raois, has a land area of 36.67 hectares, and is good as pastureland. The second, &quot;Umingan sandy&quot;, with a land area of 1191.57 hectares, is good for upland rice and vegetables. The third, &quot;San Manuel clay loam&quot;, which is best for bananas, cotton and vegetables, has an area of 1244.57 hectares. The fourth, &quot;Bantog clay&quot;—considered as the most significant type for soil, and the best clay material for making pots, jars and all earthenware, has a land area of 31.65 hectares. The fifth, &quot;beach sand&quot;, with a land area of 7.28 hectares, is generally found on the shores of all the beaches of Vigan, and is best for coconut plantation.

===Geologic base and mineral resources===
The sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that are present in the city are alluvium, fluviatile, lacustrine, paludal and beach deposits such as coral, stools, and beach rock. These are predominantly found along the coastal areas of Vigan. An important non-metallic mineral resource found in Vigan is the kind of clay that is used in making earthen jars locally called &quot;burnay.&quot; Earthenware of different uses and sizes are made of this kind of clay. Known as &quot;Bantog clay&quot;, the mineral is the basic material in making bricks. These bricks are the original materials in building the Hispanic houses of Vigan.

===Physiography===
Vigan is situated in a Quaternary Age sedimentary plain called the Vigan-Bantay Plain which is part of the Ilocos coastal plain. The Vigan-Bantay Plain is bounded on the east by a moderately rugged Miocene sediments consisting of interbedded sandstones and shale to very rugged Meta-volcanics and Meta sediment topography; on the south is the Municipality of Santa where the north–south trending fault terminates; to the west is the South China Sea; while the northern boundary opens to the northern extension of the Ilocos coastal plain.

The central part of the plain is characterized by a dissected ridge of Plio-Pleistocene age that trends in a northeast–southwest direction. The ridge divides the Vigan-Bantay Plain into northern and southern plains.

The northern part of the plain is drained by minor rivers namely: Bantaoay, Santo Tomas, and Nauman rivers, while the Abra River is the main drainage network of the southern portion of the plain. The Abra River meanders into the hinterland but exhibits a braided pattern across the plain.

The drainage network of the eastern margin of Vigan-Bantay plain consist of deeply cut valleys whose pattern is strongly controlled by main faulting trends, particularly those in the northerly and easterly directions.

Vigan is being drained by the Vigan River and Bantay River, respectively, on the north and on the south by Mestizo River whose water discharge comes from the Bantaoay head waters.

The relief of the Vigan-Bantay plain is actively level to undulating with a slope ranging from 0% to 8%. Vigan in particular is generally in level with several hills in Barangays Tamag, Bulala, and Salindeg, sometimes reaching about 50 meters in elevation and has a slope ranging from 3% to 8%.

The eastern margin of the plain characterized by a steep to very steep slope, about 40% to 60%, the relief often reaches an elevation of more than 600 meters especially the northerly and easterly portion.

The dominant topographic feature in the eastern margin of the town is the Vigan Gap Hill where the continuously shifting Vigan River cuts its way. The Gap Hill is located approximately 10 kilometers east of Vigan.

===Weather and climate===
The city of Vigan falls under (tropical savanna), which is characterized by two pronounced seasons – the dry season which starts from the month of November and ends in April; and the wet season which spans the months of May to October. The average annual rainfall is and the heaviest registered rainfall is .

The average temperature is 26 °C. The average warmest temperature is 30.9 °C and the average coldest temperature is 21.1 °C. An average of 7-10 typhoons visit Vigan annually. The average relative humidity is 81%.

===Local government===
Vigan is part of the first congressional district of the province of Ilocos Sur. It is governed by a mayor, designated as its local chief executive, and by a city council as its legislative body in accordance with the Local Government Code. The mayor, vice mayor, and the councilors are elected directly by the people through an election which is being held every three years.

==Architecture==

When Juan de Salcedo founded Vigan in 1572, he decided to pattern its urban plan with that of Intramuros, the walled city in Manila.

The urban planners of the Spanish government also followed a basic pattern that can be observed in most old towns in the country, whose establishment dates back to the Spanish colonial period. This pattern is detailed in the &quot;Ley de las Indias,&quot; the Law of the Indies, and was put into force in the 18th century. Under the Law of the Indies streets were to follow a grid pattern, the center of which being a plaza or central park.

In Vigan, the central park is the Plaza Salcedo. Next to it are the administrative buildings—the Casa Real or provincial administrative office, and the &quot;municipio&quot; (municipal hall). A stone&#x27;s throw away are the religious buildings—the seminary of the archdiocese, the Arzobispado (Archbishop&#x27;s Palace), and the St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Beside these religious structures is the church-run school, the Saint Paul College, known in its early days as the &quot;Colegio de Niñas.&quot; After the full transfer of the said school to the neighboring towns of Bantay and San Vicente, the building was handed over to the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia and is currently being occupied by a retail store chain, with only a commemorative plaque at the building&#x27;s entrance and the old &quot;ROSARY COLLEGE&quot; concrete sign at its rear reminding visitors of its past (the school&#x27;s old logo, once found at the building&#x27;s facade, has been removed sometime later).

A unique thing is the existence of another plaza, the &quot;Plaza Burgos&quot;, which is immediately beside the St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. After the first tier emanating from Plaza Salcedo are the houses of prominent residents that now make up the preserved heritage houses of Vigan. This urban plan remained relatively intact despite wars and natural calamities that have been endured by Vigan since its foundation.

The major changes to the original urban landscape were caused by fires. The Casa Real was replaced with a provincial capitol building during the American period when the original structure burned down. The archdiocese seminary was also destroyed by fire in 1968, and it lay in ruins until the late 1990s, when part of a shopping mall was built on the site.

The residential areas were likewise not spared. Some of the houses on Crisologo Street were casualties of fire during the Japanese period; several houses on Quezon Avenue were destroyed by fire in 1952; while in 1971, some houses near Plaza Burgos burned down as well. The houses along Crisologo Street that were burned were later reconstructed faithfully following the architecture of the former structures.

Presently, there are other major areas of activities other than the two plazas, though these are still where most recreation and shopping are done. One may also go to the southern part of the city to reach the commercial area and public market. The current public market is a new one, as the old one (formerly the Imelda Socio-Commercial Complex), on the same site, was (also) destroyed by fire. A new mall (opened in December 2017) was constructed on the site of the city&#x27;s first Public Market, found in the center of the business district, after being the site of some business establishments and a tricycle-for-hire terminal.

==Tourism==

Popular sites include Calle Crisologo located in the Mestizo district- the old quarters of the city. Syquia Mansion Museum, Plaza Salcedo&#x27;s Dancing Fountain, Padre Burgos House, Baluarte Zoo, and the National Museum of the Philippines. Nearby is the Bantay Church Bell Tower. Of special note is the Hotel Luna, which houses an extensive collection of art, including La Mandolinera by Juan Luna. Centuries-old Sta. Maria Church, designated also as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

===Longganiza festival===
Mayor Jose &#x27;Bonito&#x27; Singson, Jr. led the 2024 Grand Parade of Vigan City Fiesta and Vigan longganisa Festival. The 2024 Fiesta featured Banaoang Marathon, a 12-kilometer track from Banaoang Bridge from Santa, Ilocos Sur and Bantay, Ilocos Sur boundary to the Plaza Burgos, Vigan, LGBTQIA+ Day, Vigan Conservation Complex symposium, Community Alay Gupit, Got Talent and fashion show, Vigan Food Festival, Search for Miss Vigan, Dog and Cat Fun Day, Longganisa Street Dance Showdown, Pinaka-Livestock contest, Education Day, and Social Services Night. On January 22, 2024, Vigan launched &#x27;101 Ways to Cook Longganisa&#x27; cookbook for the January 18–27, 2024 Longganisa Festival.

==Transportation==
===Metro transport===
Modes of transport within the city are purely land-based. Vehicles for public use include jeepneys, tricycles, vans-for-hire (or PUVs/public utility vehicles) and &quot;calesa&quot;s (horse-drawn vehicles). Buses, mini-buses and jeepneys provide transportation to and from Vigan. The metro Vigan transport system is mostly served by tricycles, which are color- and number-coded to identify their municipality of origin.

===Land transportation===
Vigan City is well-served by a network of roads and a major highway that connects to Manila North Road, the highway leading to Manila and the rest of the country. Major bus companies such as Dominion Bus Lines, Viron Transit, Partas, and Aniceto/St. Joseph operate terminals in Vigan. GMW Florida Transport operates a terminal in Bantay, just outside Vigan. Bus companies such as Maria de Leon and Fariñas pass by Vigan on their way to Laoag. They operate direct and/or indirect bus services from Vigan City to points in Luzon, mostly to Manila, Baguio, and Laoag and vice versa. There are also independent bus operators, who recently banded together to form different transport cooperatives, plying the Laoag-Vigan-Carmen and Vigan-Abra routes, and have a joint terminal found at the New Vigan Public Market Annex. A taxi service started operating in 2019, just before the COViD-19 pandemic struck.

===Air transportation===
A secondary airport called Vigan Airport (also known as Mindoro Airport) is located at Barangay Mindoro. It has one asphalted runway, 900 meters long and 30 meters wide. The airport was once a dormant asset of the city for it does not generate revenue, with only chartered and private planes using it; it is currently being upgraded and is on its way toward commercialization.

<text>Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Sweden (, SKA), initially called SKP (ml), was a communist party in Sweden, formed in 1980 after a split from the pro-People&#x27;s Republic of China Communist Party of Sweden (SKP). The party was dissolved in 1993.

==Formation==
When a leftist minority (approx. 15% of party cadre) was expelled from the Communist Party of Sweden (SKP) in 1980, the expellees founded the Communist Party of Sweden (marxist-leninists) (&quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (marxist-leninisterna)&quot;) on November 1–2. The group that formed SKP (ml) was critical of the new leadership of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, effectively under Deng Xiaoping. Per-Åke Lindblom became the chairman of SKP (ml). SKP (ml) began publishing the magazine &quot;Kommunistiska Arbetartidningen&quot; in January 1981.

==Name change==
At a party congress on Penecoastal 1981, the name of SKP (ml) was changed to Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Sweden (&quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Arbetarparti&quot;, SKA). The party motivated the change by three reasons: 1. The name SKP (ml) was easily confused with SKP, 2. SKA was a shorter and more direct name and 3. SKA was more in line with the name of their publication. The congress also adopted a resolution titled &#x27;Build a front against the Super Powers&#x27;.

==Dissolution==
In 1993, SKA and the pro-Albanian KPS were dissolved in favor of an informal network. &quot;Kommunistiska Arbetartidningen&quot; and the KPS mouthpiece &quot;Kommunisten&quot; merged into &quot;Nya Arbetartidningen&quot; on May 16, 1993. &quot;Nya Arbetartidningen&quot; was published in paper until 2009 and still exists as an internet magazine.

==Electoral politics==
SKP (ml)/SKA did not run in elections, but promoted blank votes. It did not find it reasonable to vote for VPK, as VPK had publicly promised never to bring down a Social Democratic government. Moreover it opposed VPKs ties to the Soviet bloc.

==International relations==
SKP (ml)/SKA never had direct contacts with the Communist Party of China nor the Party of Labour of Albania. It had bilateral contacts with other maoist groups such as MLPD (Germany), AKP (m-l) (Norway) and KFML (Denmark). It participated in international conferences organized by MLPD.

SKP (ml)/SKA considered USA and the Soviet Union as equal threats to the revolutionary forces. It supported the Solidarity movement in Poland, the mujahedin struggle in Afghanistan and opposed Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia.

<text>Field Hill is a steep portion of the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Kansas City located near Field, British Columbia. Field was created solely to accommodate the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s need for additional locomotives to be added to trains about to tackle both Field Hill, and the Big Hill. Here a stone roundhouse with turntable was built at what was first known simply as Third Siding. In December 1884 the CPR renamed it Field after Cyrus W. Field, a Chicago businessman who had visited recently on a special train. 

Difficult grades exist in both directions from Field, east through spiral tunnels to Calgary, Alberta; and west to Revelstoke, British Columbia, through Rogers Pass and the Connaught Tunnel, and where the modern Mount Macdonald Tunnel was opened in 1989. 

Following completion of the Spiral Tunnels which eliminated the Big Hill, Field remained an important place as it was still necessary to add helper (bank) engines to get trains over the steep 2.2% (116 feet to the mile, or 22 metres to the kilometre) grade of Field Hill. 

Even bigger locomotives were needed and this time six massive 0-6-6-0 Mallet type (see: Whyte notation) were built (one in 1909 and five in 1911). Five were compound engines, the last one a simple engine). These were of a unique design with both pairs of cylinders together at the middle of the boiler. The design was not repeated and eventually these engines were rebuilt (1916–17) into 2-10-0s. 

More powerful still were the fourteen 2-10-2s built (1919–20) for work on the mountain. These were followed in 1929 by the most powerful steam locomotives in the British Empire, twenty 2-10-4 Selkirks. A further ten were built in 1938 and a final six in 1949, the last one being 5935, the last steam locomotive built for the CPR. 

Diesel-electric locomotives followed, and over the decades bigger and more powerful diesels replaced smaller ones just as was the case with the steam locomotives that had preceded them. 

Even though the Spiral Tunnels eliminated the Big Hill, the mountains remained and so too did the Field Hill. The Ottertail revision of 1902 and the five-mile () long double track Connaught Tunnel of 1916 were other improvements made to the original line in British Columbia. It was not until the late 20th century when a major new project of including the Mount Macdonald Tunnel reduced the grade to a very manageable average of 0.82%, (maximum 1%) opened in December 1988.

<text>Human furniture is furniture in which a person&#x27;s body is used as a tray, foot stool, chair, table, cabinet or other item. In some cases a sculpture of a human body is used instead. Examples of human furniture have appeared in modern art. Forniphilia is the paraphilia relating to human furniture, including that seen in fetish photography and bondage pornography.

==Art==
A model used as human furniture may be nude or semi-nude to add to the erotic or aesthetic appeal. A classic example of the depiction of human furniture as art is the set of three sculptures &quot;Hatstand&quot;, &quot;Table&quot; and &quot;Chair&quot; made in 1969 by British pop artist Allen Jones which show semi-naked white women in the roles of furniture. Allen Jones&#x27; artwork was the subject of a feminist protest when it was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2012.

Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard created a sculpture called &quot;Chair&quot; which has the same shape as the Allen Jones&#x27; chair but depicts a black woman. In 2014 art collector Dasha Zhukova, the partner of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, caused controversy by appearing in a photograph sitting on Melgaard&#x27;s chair. Zhukova apologized for the photograph saying that she &quot;utterly abhor[s] racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by this image&quot;.

The Japanese fetish artist Namio Harukawa depicted voluptuous women, who dominated and used men as human furniture.

==Bondage==
The term &quot;forniphilia&quot; was coined by bondage artist Jeff Gord who specialized in the subgenre and maintained the website &quot;House of Gord&quot; on the subject. Forniphilia as a form of bondage usually involves the subject being tightly bound and expected to stay immobile for a prolonged period. Gord said that the maximum period he used depended on the bondage techniques involved but it did not generally exceed two hours. Gord also warned that the dangers inherent in forniphilia meant that it should only be carried out by experts. Gord used gags in some of his creations. A forniphilic gag is a type of gag that has the primary purpose of sexual objectification or erotic humiliation. Proper safety requires frequent checks of the submissive&#x27;s well-being.

==In fiction==

The 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; includes a scene of a gang sitting in a room furnished with tables shaped like nude women.

In Episode 7 of the 2021 Netflix Original Korean Drama, &quot;Squid Game&quot;, the anonymous VIPs invited to watch the show&#x27;s blood sport are surrounded by human furniture, which are seen wearing elaborate body paint.

<doc id="869569" wikidata="Q3880675" url="?curid=869569" title="Seeing Things (TV series)">
<text>Seeing Things is a Canadian comedy-drama mystery television series with a fantasy twist, in that the lead character has postcognitive visions that help solve each episode&#x27;s mystery. The series originally aired on CBC Television from 1981 to 1987. It was also seen in Europe, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Australia and the United States. In all, 43 episodes were produced. With the exception of &quot;Seeing R.E.D.&quot; (90 minutes) episodes were one hour long.

Series star Louis Del Grande (formerly an actor, writer, and co-producer of the hit sitcom &quot;The King of Kensington&quot;) was also the show&#x27;s co-creator, with writer David Barlow. Del Grande and Barlow wrote the first three episodes, and thereafter oversaw the writing staff and produced all 43 episodes.

==Cast and premise==
*Louis Del Grande stars as Louis Ciccone, a balding, overweight 40-ish newspaper journalist for the &quot;Toronto Gazette&quot;. Although the manic, motormouthed Louis is generally friendly, in pursuing his stories he&#x27;s often pushy and self-centered, and is usually somewhat disorganized. However, Lou is tenacious and dedicated, and he also has limited postcognitive abilities, which help him to solve murders (and get the resultant headline scoops). Louis can only control his postcognitive abilities by investigating clues given to him in a vision ... only when he discovers new information will further visions occur, which provide increasingly more detail until they finally reveal the murderer. At the start of the series, Louis&#x27; frequently rocky personal life is at a definite ebb—he&#x27;s recently separated from his wife, and is living in a storeroom above his parents&#x27; bakery. But as career-focused as Louis is, he&#x27;s equally tenacious about getting back together with his semi-estranged wife and his pre-teen son, and he works hard to stay in their lives.
*Martha Gibson (Del Grande&#x27;s real-life wife) co-stars as Ciccone&#x27;s ex-wife Marge, who, even though she and Louie are separated, reluctantly continues to help him with his cases. Marge even drives Louie around town (Louie, like Del Grande in real life, was too hyper to get a driver&#x27;s license), though she initially rejected Louie&#x27;s desire to rekindle their relationship. Marge clearly still loves Lou, but is continually frustrated by Louie&#x27;s focus on his job, which gives him an unpredictable schedule and takes him away from family life for long stretches. However, they finally became a couple again in the show&#x27;s final season. Del Grande and Gibson were married, then divorced in real life; they had re-wed just before the series started.
*Janet-Laine Green plays assistant crown attorney Heather Redfern. A young, competent prosecuting attorney from an upper-class background, Redfern is one of the very few people who know about Louie&#x27;s postcognitive abilities, which often relate to cases she&#x27;s working on. Though she generally respects Louie&#x27;s visions, she&#x27;s often exasperated by their vague or inconclusive nature. She&#x27;s even more frustrated by Louie&#x27;s tendency to, unannounced and uninvited, interrupt Redfern directly in the middle of client meetings, trials, social events, dates, or even in the middle of the night, to share his latest visions and/or theories with her. Louie&#x27;s frequent meetings with the gorgeous young lawyer also contribute to feelings of jealousy in Marge, although Louie and Redfern are never more than close working colleagues. In fact, Louie invariably refers to her as &quot;Redfern&quot;, and Redfern always addresses Louie as &quot;Mr. Ciccone&quot;.

===Other Ciccone family members===
*Al Bernardo plays Alberto Ciccone, Louis&#x27; father. Generally cheerful, he encourages Louis to get back together with Marge. He runs a small local bakery, with his wife.
*Lynne Gordon plays Anna Ciccone, Louis&#x27; mother. She tends to be a little less forgiving of Louis&#x27; foibles, and is definitely embarrassed by him having to move back in with his parents in his late thirties.
*Ivan Beaulieu as Jason Ciccone, the son of Louis and Marge. A pre-teen at the series&#x27; start, Jason is an upbeat, fairly well-adjusted kid, despite his odd family circumstances. He lives with Marge, but sees Louie quite frequently.

===Louie&#x27;s workmates===
*Murray Westgate plays Max Perkins, Louie&#x27;s demanding, impatient editor at the Gazette. 
*Louis Negin plays Marlon Bede, the Gazette&#x27;s food writer. Louie often mooches meals that Marlon&#x27;s preparing (or creating recipes for) in his specially-built on-site Test Kitchen.

===Other regulars===
*Ratch Wallace as Kenny Volker, Redfern&#x27;s most frequent dating partner through the series. Volker, a professional hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs, is tall, muscular, wealthy and generally polite ... although on the ice, he&#x27;s paid to be a no-holds-barred goon. 
*Cec Linder as Crown Attorney Robert T. Spenser, Redfern&#x27;s boss. Much more conservative than Redfern, Spenser is very concerned with appearances, and maintaining his office&#x27;s aura of respectability. Spenser has little use for Louie Ciccone, who he believes is certifiably crazy—and almost no tolerance for Redfern&#x27;s continued association with him.
*Frank Adamson as Sergeant John Brown, the Toronto homicide detective most often assigned to the cases Louis has an interest in. He has a mostly antagonistic relationship with Louis, but will begrudgingly admit that Ciccone has given him some good information that has led to the right arrests.
*John Fox as Officer Falstaff, Brown&#x27;s clumsy-but-good-natured usual partner.

&quot;Seeing Things&quot; was a hit, and guest-starred several celebrities, such as Ronnie Hawkins, Bruno Gerussi, Gordon Pinsent and Karen Kain. Another notable appearance is by Mark McKinney of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, who played a character working in a morgue in the episode &quot;Another Point of View&quot;.

==Reception==
The show won several awards. In 1983, Del Grande won an ACTRA Award for Best Actor in a Television Drama, and Sheldon Chad won an ACTRA award for Best Writer Television Drama for the episode &quot;Seeing Double&quot;.

In Canada, it aired on CBC, typically drawing 1.1 million viewers. In the United States, it was broadcast by PBS.

At the time it first aired, it was the &quot;most successful home-grown program in Canada&quot;.

<doc id="869583" wikidata="Q4574771" url="?curid=869583" title="Communist Labour League of Sweden">
<text>The Sveriges Kommunistiska Arbetarförbund (SKA; ) was formed in 1956 by a group of Stalinist hardliners who left or were expelled from the SKP during the 1950s. This group had earlier formed &quot;Marxist circles&quot;, in which some SKP militants participated secretly. The group was headed by Set Persson, a famous communist from Stockholm who had left SKP at the party congress in 1953.

SKA started publishing the magazine &quot;Revolt&quot;. In its pages SKA defended Joseph Stalin and criticized the new Soviet regime under Nikita Khrushchev. They criticized SKP for what they considered as &quot;populism&quot;. The group also expressed some criticism over the human rights situation within the Eastern Bloc.

In 1958, SKA tried to launch their own list of candidates for the municipal elections in Stockholm but failed to get any seats. Persson died in 1960. After his death, the group almost disappeared but a remnant continued to exist until 1967. SKA never played any role in Swedish politics. However, the organizational experiences of the people who were active in SKA became important for the later generation of leftists, such as the KFML.

<doc id="869587" wikidata="Q738975" url="?curid=869587" title="Assam tea">
<text>Assam tea is a black tea named after Assam, India, the region of its production. It is manufactured specifically from the plant &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var. &quot;assamica&quot; (Masters). Assam&#x27;s people tried to plant the Chinese varieties in Assam soil but did not succeed. Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam tea, are often sold as &quot;breakfast&quot; teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.

The state of Assam is the world&#x27;s largest tea-growing region by production, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and very close to China. This part of India experiences high rainfall; during the monsoon period, as much as 250 to 300 mm (10 to 12 in) of rain falls per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 36 °C (96.8 °F), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam tea&#x27;s unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known.

Though &quot;Assam&quot; generally denotes the distinctive black teas from Assam, the region produces smaller quantities of green and white teas as well, with their own distinctive characteristics.
Historically, Assam has been the second commercial tea production region after southern China, the only two regions in the world with native tea plants.

The introduction of the Assam tea bush to Europe is related to Robert Bruce, a Scottish adventurer, who apparently encountered it in the year 1823. Bruce reportedly found the plant growing &quot;wild&quot; in Assam while trading in the region. Maniram Dewan directed him to the local Singpho chief Bessa Gam. Bruce noticed local people (the Singhpos) brewing tea from the leaves of the bush and arranged with the local chiefs to provide him with samples of the leaves and seeds, which he planned to have scientifically examined. Robert Bruce died shortly thereafter, without having seen the plant properly classified. It was not until the early 1830s that Robert&#x27;s brother, Charles, arranged for a few leaves from the Assam tea bush to be sent to the botanical gardens in Calcutta for proper examination. There, the plant was finally identified as a variety of tea, or &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var &quot;assamica&quot;, but different from the Chinese version (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; var. &quot;sinensis&quot;). The indigenous Assam tea plant was first mentioned by a historian called Samuel Baidon who published &quot;Tea in Assam&quot; in 1877.

== History ==
While on a trade expedition through the Assam area with Singpho in 1823, Robert Bruce was introduced to a plant with which the Singpho and Khamti people made beverages and food. Through his brother, Charles Alexander Bruce who was in Sadiya, samples were sent to botanist Nathaniel Wallich who mistook it for &quot;camellia kissi&quot;. It was not until over a decade later that the Singpho&#x27;s plant would be recognized as being the same plant as the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; growing in China, after Francis Jenkins and Andrew Charlton responded to the request of the British East India Company&#x27;s Tea Committee for its agents to review prospects for establishing a source of tea outside of China. Charles Bruce guided a team, including Nathaniel Wallich, William Griffith and John McClelland, dispatched from the Tea Committee in 1836, to review the plant in its natural growing conditions around Sadiya. It was cultivated in the company&#x27;s experimental garden with the first batch shipped to London in 1838 and auctioned in January 1839. Though it sold well the batch was noted as lacking fragrance compared to the tea from China which had been selectively cultivated for hundreds of years and having a dullness thought to be a consequence of inexperienced processing. 

That same year, two companies were incorporated to pursue the tea&#x27;s development in Assam: the Assam Tea Association in London and the Bengal Tea Association in Kolkata, though they quickly amalgamated to form the Assam Company. Despite early proponents such as Maniram Dewan, British-led land reforms such as the &quot;Waste Lands Act&quot; to clear and privatize plots of land for agricultural purposes, the Assam Company struggled and was forced to reorganize in 1847. Similarly, despite having access to a large source of inexpensive labour, including tea-makers smuggled out of China, indentured Indians, and refugees from famine-stricken areas, Assam at the time was a sparsely-populated, hot and humid undeveloped area and many died of disease. Despite the poor results, investment came from Britain to establish additional tea gardens, such as the Jorehaut Tea Company around Jorhat, in 1860s though by 1870 56 of the 60 companies operating tea gardens in Assam went bankrupt. Industrial mechanization in the 1870s finally resulted in profitable companies as more plucked leaves were able to be dried without rotting in the humid environment. Heated withering tables and steam-powered rolling machines precipitated a need for grading so the British adapted the existing systems of tea leaf grading to sort their products. The Indian Tea Districts Association was established in London in 1879 and in Kolkata in 1881 (as the Indian Tea Association) to organize and advance these tea interests. By 1888 tea imported from India finally exceeded that from China.

== Production ==

Most of the currently operating tea estates in Assam are members of the Assam Branch of the Indian Tea Association (ABITA), which is the oldest and most prominent body of tea producers of India.
===Steps===
There are between two and seven steps involved in the processing of fresh tea leaves, the addition or exclusion of any of these stages resulting in a different type of tea. Each of these procedures is carried out in a climate-controlled facility to avoid spoilage due to excess moisture and fluctuating temperatures.

&quot;Withering&quot; refers to the wilting of fresh green tea leaves. The purpose of withering is to reduce the moisture content in the leaves and to allow the flavor compounds to develop. While it can be done outdoors, controlled withering usually takes place indoors. Freshly plucked leaves are laid out in a series of troughs and subjected to hot air forced from underneath the troughs. During the course of withering, the moisture content in the leaf is reduced by about 30%, making the leaf look limp and soft enough for rolling. Additionally, the volatile compounds in the leaf, including the level of caffeine and the flavors, begin to intensify. A short wither allows the leaves to retain a greenish appearance and grassy flavors while a longer wither darkens the leaf and intensifies the aromatic compounds.

&quot;Fixing&quot; or &quot;kill-green&quot; refers to the process by which enzymatic browning of the wilted leaves is controlled through the application of heat. It is held that the longer it takes to fix the leaves, the more aromatic the tea will be. Fixing is carried out via steaming, pan firing, baking or with the use of heated tumblers. Application of steam heats the leaves more quickly than pan firing, as a result of which steamed teas taste ‘green’ and vegetal while the pan-fired ones taste toasty. This procedure is carried out for green teas, yellow teas and raw pu&#x27;er teas.

&quot;Oxidation&quot; results in the browning of the leaves and intensification of their flavor compounds. From the moment they are plucked, the cells within the tea leaves are exposed to oxygen and the volatile compounds within them begin to undergo chemical reactions. It is at this stage that polyphenolic oxidase, including &quot;theaflavin&quot; and &quot;thearubigin&quot;, begin to develop within the leaves. &quot;Theaflavins&quot; lend briskness and brightness to the tea while &quot;thearubigins&quot; offer depth and fullness to the liquor that&#x27;s produced. In order to bring out specific intensities in flavors, tea makers control the amount of oxidation the leaves undergo. Controlled-oxidation is typically carried out in a large room where the temperature is maintained at 25–30 °C and humidity stands steady at 60–70%. Here, withered and rolled leaves are spread out on long shelves and left to ferment for a fixed period of time, depending on the type of tea being made. To halt or slow down oxidation, fermented leaves are moved to a panning trough where they are heated and then dried. Due to oxidation, the leaves undergo a complete transformation and exhibit an aroma and taste profile that&#x27;s completely different from the profile of the leaves that do not undergo this process. Less oxidized teas tend to retain most of their green color and vegetal characteristics due to lower production of polyphenols. A semi-oxidized leaf has a brown appearance and produces yellow-amber liquor. In a fully oxidized tea, amino acids and lipids break down completely, turning the leaves blackish-brown. The flavors in such a tea are more brisk and imposing.

&quot;Rolling&quot; involves shaping the processed leaves into a tight form. As a part of this procedure, wilted / fixed leaves are gently rolled, and depending on the style, they are shaped to look wiry, kneaded, or as tightly rolled pellets. During the rolling action, essential oils and sap tend to ooze out of the leaves, intensifying the taste further. The more tightly rolled the leaves, the longer they will retain their freshness.

&quot;Drying&quot; In order to keep the tea moisture-free, the leaves are dried at various stages of production. Drying enhances a tea&#x27;s flavors and ensures its long shelf-life. Also, drying brings down the tea&#x27;s moisture content to less than 1%. To dry the leaves they are fired or roasted at a low temperature for a controlled period of time, typically inside an industrial scale oven. If the leaves are dried too quickly, the tea can turn abrasive and taste harsh.

&quot;Aging&quot; some teas are subjected to aging and fermentation to make them more palatable. Some types of Chinese Pu-erh, for example, are fermented and aged for years, much like wine.

=== Separate time zone ===
Tea gardens in Assam do not follow the Indian Standard Time (IST), which is the time observed throughout India and Sri Lanka. The local time in Assam&#x27;s tea gardens, known as &quot;Tea Garden Time&quot; or &quot;Sah Bagan Time&quot; (also used by Myanmar as MMT), is an hour ahead of the IST. The system was introduced during British rule keeping in mind the early sunrise in this part of the country.

By and large, the system has subsequently been successful in increasing the productivity of tea garden workers as they save on daylight by finishing the work during daytime, and vice versa. Working time for tea laborers in the gardens is generally between 9 a.m. (IST 8 a.m.) to 5 p.m. (IST 4 p.m.) It may vary slightly from garden to garden.

Noted filmmaker Jahnu Barua has been campaigning for a separate time zone for the northeast region.

== Geography ==

The tea plant is grown in the lowlands of Assam, unlike Darjeelings and Nilgiris, which are grown in the highlands. It is cultivated in the valley of the Brahmaputra River, an area of clay soil rich in the nutrients of the floodplain. The climate varies between a cool, arid winter and a hot, humid rainy season—conditions ideal for growing tea. Because of its long growing season and generous rainfall, Assam is one of the most prolific tea-producing regions in the world. Each year, the tea estates of Assam collectively yield approximately 680.5 million kg (1,500 million pounds weight) of tea.

Assam tea is generally harvested twice, in a &quot;first flush&quot; and a &quot;second flush&quot;. The first flush is picked during late March. The second flush, harvested later, is the more prized &quot;tippy tea&quot;, named thus for the gold tips that appear on the leaves. This second flush, tippy tea, is sweeter and more full-bodied and is generally considered superior to the first flush tea. The leaves of the Assam tea bush are dark green and glossy and fairly wide compared to those of the Chinese tea plant. The bush produces delicate white blossoms.

<doc id="869590" wikidata="Q5961083" url="?curid=869590" title="Canonical quantization">
<text>In physics, canonical quantization is a procedure for quantizing a classical theory, while attempting to preserve the formal structure, such as symmetries, of the classical theory to the greatest extent possible.

Historically, this was not quite Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s route to obtaining quantum mechanics, but Paul Dirac introduced it in his 1926 doctoral thesis, the &quot;method of classical analogy&quot; for quantization, and detailed it in his classic text &quot;Principles of Quantum Mechanics&quot;. The word &quot;canonical&quot; arises from the Hamiltonian approach to classical mechanics, in which a system&#x27;s dynamics is generated via canonical Poisson brackets, a structure which is &quot;only partially preserved&quot; in canonical quantization.

This method was further used by Paul Dirac in the context of quantum field theory, in his construction of quantum electrodynamics. In the field theory context, it is also called the second quantization of fields, in contrast to the semi-classical first quantization of single particles.

==History==

When it was first developed, quantum physics dealt only with the quantization of the motion of particles, leaving the electromagnetic field classical, hence the name quantum mechanics.

Later the electromagnetic field was also quantized, and even the particles themselves became represented through quantized fields, resulting in the development of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum field theory in general. Thus, by convention, the original form of particle quantum mechanics is denoted first quantization, while quantum field theory is formulated in the language of second quantization.

==First quantization==
===Single particle systems===

The following exposition is based on Dirac&#x27;s treatise on quantum mechanics.
In the classical mechanics of a particle, there are dynamic variables which are called coordinates () and momenta (). These specify the &quot;state&quot; of a classical system. The canonical structure (also known as the symplectic structure) of classical mechanics consists of Poisson brackets enclosing these variables, such as . All transformations of variables which preserve these brackets are allowed as canonical transformations in classical mechanics. Motion itself is such a canonical transformation.

By contrast, in quantum mechanics, all significant features of a particle are contained in a state formula_1, called a quantum state. Observables are represented by operators acting on a Hilbert space of such quantum states.

The eigenvalue of an operator acting on one of its eigenstates represents the value of a measurement on the particle thus represented. For example, the energy is read off by the Hamiltonian operator formula_2 acting on a state formula_3, yielding
formula_4
where is the characteristic energy associated to this formula_3 eigenstate.

Any state could be represented as a linear combination of eigenstates of energy; for example,
formula_6where are constant coefficients.

As in classical mechanics, all dynamical operators can be represented by functions of the position and momentum ones, formula_7 and formula_8, respectively. The connection between this representation and the more usual wavefunction representation is given by the eigenstate of the position operator formula_7 representing a particle at position formula_10, which is denoted by an element formula_11 in the Hilbert space, and which satisfies formula_12. Then, formula_13.

Likewise, the eigenstates formula_14 of the momentum operator formula_8 specify the momentum representation: formula_16.

The central relation between these operators is a quantum analog of the above Poisson bracket of classical mechanics, the canonical commutation relation,
formula_17

This relation encodes (and formally leads to) the uncertainty principle, in the form . This algebraic structure may be thus considered as the quantum analog of the &quot;canonical structure&quot; of classical mechanics.

===Many-particle systems===

When turning to N-particle systems, i.e., systems containing N identical particles (particles characterized by the same quantum numbers such as mass, charge and spin), it is necessary to extend the single-particle state function formula_18 to the N-particle state function formula_19. A fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics concerns the concept of indistinguishability of identical particles. Only two species of particles are thus possible in quantum physics, the so-called bosons and fermions which obey the following rules for each kind of particle:

* for bosons: formula_20
* for fermions: formula_21

where we have interchanged two coordinates formula_22 of the state function. The usual wave function is obtained using the Slater determinant and the identical particles theory. Using this basis, it is possible to solve various many-particle problems.

==Issues and limitations==
===Classical and quantum brackets===
Dirac&#x27;s book details his popular rule of supplanting Poisson brackets by commutators:
One might interpret this proposal as saying that we should seek a &quot;quantization map&quot; formula_23 mapping a function formula_24 on the classical phase space to an operator formula_25 on the quantum Hilbert space such that
formula_26
It is now known that there is no reasonable such quantization map satisfying the above identity exactly for all functions formula_24 and 

===Groenewold&#x27;s theorem===
One concrete version of the above impossibility claim is Groenewold&#x27;s theorem (after Dutch theoretical physicist Hilbrand J. Groenewold), which we describe for a system with one degree of freedom for simplicity. Let us accept the following &quot;ground rules&quot; for the map formula_23. First, formula_23 should send the constant function 1 to the identity operator. Second, formula_23 should take formula_10 and formula_32 to the usual position and momentum operators formula_33 and formula_34. Third, formula_23 should take a polynomial in formula_10 and formula_32 to a &quot;polynomial&quot; in formula_33 and formula_34, that is, a finite linear combinations of products of formula_33 and formula_34, which may be taken in any desired order. In its simplest form, Groenewold&#x27;s theorem says that there is no map satisfying the above ground rules and also the bracket condition
formula_42
for all polynomials formula_24 and formula_44.

Actually, the nonexistence of such a map occurs already by the time we reach polynomials of degree four. Note that the Poisson bracket of two polynomials of degree four has degree six, so it does not exactly make sense to require a map on polynomials of degree four to respect the bracket condition. We &quot;can&quot;, however, require that the bracket condition holds when formula_24 and formula_44 have degree three. Groenewold&#x27;s theorem can be stated as follows:
The proof can be outlined as follows. Suppose we first try to find a quantization map on polynomials of degree less than or equal to three satisfying the bracket condition whenever formula_24 has degree less than or equal to two and formula_44 has degree less than or equal to two. Then there is precisely one such map, and it is the Weyl quantization. The impossibility result now is obtained by writing the same polynomial of degree four as a Poisson bracket of polynomials of degree three &quot;in two different ways&quot;. Specifically, we have
formula_49
On the other hand, we have already seen that if there is going to be a quantization map on polynomials of degree three, it must be the Weyl quantization; that is, we have already determined the only possible quantization of all the cubic polynomials above.

The argument is finished by computing by brute force that
formula_50
does not coincide with
formula_51
Thus, we have two incompatible requirements for the value of formula_52.

===Axioms for quantization===
If represents the quantization map that acts on functions in classical phase space, then the following properties are usually considered desirable:
#formula_53 and formula_54   (elementary position/momentum operators)
#formula_55   is a linear map
#formula_56   (Poisson bracket)
#formula_57   (von Neumann rule).

However, not only are these four properties mutually inconsistent, &quot;any three&quot; of them are also inconsistent! As it turns out, the only pairs of these properties that lead to self-consistent, nontrivial solutions are 2 &amp; 3, and possibly 1 &amp; 3 or 1 &amp; 4. Accepting properties 1 &amp; 2, along with a weaker condition that 3 be true only asymptotically in the limit (see Moyal bracket), leads to deformation quantization, and some extraneous information must be provided, as in the standard theories utilized in most of physics. Accepting properties 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 but restricting the space of quantizable observables to exclude terms such as the cubic ones in the above example amounts to geometric quantization.

==Second quantization: field theory==

Quantum mechanics was successful at describing non-relativistic systems with fixed numbers of particles, but a new framework was needed to describe systems in which particles can be created or destroyed, for example, the electromagnetic field, considered as a collection of photons. It was eventually realized that special relativity was inconsistent with single-particle quantum mechanics, so that all particles are now described relativistically by quantum fields.

When the canonical quantization procedure is applied to a field, such as the electromagnetic field, the classical field variables become &quot;quantum operators&quot;. Thus, the normal modes comprising the amplitude of the field are simple oscillators, each of which is quantized in standard first quantization, above, without ambiguity. The resulting quanta are identified with individual particles or excitations. For example, the quanta of the electromagnetic field are identified with photons. Unlike first quantization, conventional second quantization is completely unambiguous, in effect a functor, since the constituent set of its oscillators are quantized unambiguously.

Historically, quantizing the classical theory of a single particle gave rise to a wavefunction. The classical equations of motion of a field are typically identical in form to the (quantum) equations for the wave-function of &quot;one of its quanta&quot;. For example, the Klein–Gordon equation is the classical equation of motion for a free scalar field, but also the quantum equation for a scalar particle wave-function. This meant that quantizing a field &quot;appeared&quot; to be similar to quantizing a theory that was already quantized, leading to the fanciful term second quantization in the early literature, which is still used to describe field quantization, even though the modern interpretation detailed is different.

One drawback to canonical quantization for a relativistic field is that by relying on the Hamiltonian to determine time dependence, relativistic invariance is no longer manifest. Thus it is necessary to check that relativistic invariance is not lost. Alternatively, the Feynman integral approach is available for quantizing relativistic fields, and is manifestly invariant. For non-relativistic field theories, such as those used in condensed matter physics, Lorentz invariance is not an issue.

===Field operators===

Quantum mechanically, the variables of a field (such as the field&#x27;s amplitude at a given point) are represented by operators on a Hilbert space. In general, all observables are constructed as operators on the Hilbert space, and the time-evolution of the operators is governed by the Hamiltonian, which must be a positive operator. A state formula_58 annihilated by the Hamiltonian must be identified as the vacuum state, which is the basis for building all other states. In a non-interacting (free) field theory, the vacuum is normally identified as a state containing zero particles. In a theory with interacting particles, identifying the vacuum is more subtle, due to vacuum polarization, which implies that the physical vacuum in quantum field theory is never really empty. For further elaboration, see the articles on the quantum mechanical vacuum and the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics. The details of the canonical quantization depend on the field being quantized, and whether it is free or interacting.

====Real scalar field====
A scalar field theory provides a good example of the canonical quantization procedure. Classically, a scalar field is a collection of an infinity of oscillator normal modes. It suffices to consider a 1+1-dimensional space-time formula_59 in which the spatial direction is compactified to a circle of circumference 2, rendering the momenta discrete.

The classical Lagrangian density describes an infinity of coupled harmonic oscillators, labelled by which is now a &quot;label&quot; (and not the displacement dynamical variable to be quantized), denoted by the classical field ,
formula_60
where is a potential term, often taken to be a polynomial or monomial of degree 3 or higher. The action functional is
formula_61The canonical momentum obtained via the Legendre transformation using the action is formula_62, and the classical Hamiltonian is found to be
formula_63

Canonical quantization treats the variables and as operators with canonical commutation relations at time = 0, given by
formula_64
Operators constructed from and can then formally be defined at other times via the time-evolution generated by the Hamiltonian,
formula_65

However, since and no longer commute, this expression is ambiguous at the quantum level. The problem is to construct a representation of the relevant operators formula_66 on a Hilbert space formula_67 and to construct a positive operator as a quantum operator on this Hilbert space in such a way that it gives this evolution for the operators formula_66 as given by the preceding equation, and to show that formula_67 contains a vacuum state formula_58 on which has zero eigenvalue. In practice, this construction is a difficult problem for interacting field theories, and has been solved completely only in a few simple cases via the methods of constructive quantum field theory. Many of these issues can be sidestepped using the Feynman integral as described for a particular in the article on scalar field theory.

In the case of a free field, with , the quantization procedure is relatively straightforward. It is convenient to Fourier transform the fields, so that
formula_71
The reality of the fields implies that
formula_72The classical Hamiltonian may be expanded in Fourier modes as
formula_73
where formula_74.

This Hamiltonian is thus recognizable as an infinite sum of classical normal mode oscillator excitations , each one of which is quantized in the standard manner, so the free quantum Hamiltonian looks identical. It is the s that have become operators obeying the standard commutation relations, , with all others vanishing. The collective Hilbert space of all these oscillators is thus constructed using creation and annihilation operators constructed from these modes,
formula_75
for which for all , with all other commutators vanishing.

The vacuum formula_58 is taken to be annihilated by all of the , and formula_67 is the Hilbert space constructed by applying any combination of the infinite collection of creation operators † to formula_58. This Hilbert space is called Fock space. For each , this construction is identical to a quantum harmonic oscillator. The quantum field is an infinite array of quantum oscillators. The quantum Hamiltonian then amounts to
formula_79where may be interpreted as the &quot;number operator&quot; giving the number of particles in a state with momentum .

This Hamiltonian differs from the previous expression by the subtraction of the zero-point energy of each harmonic oscillator. This satisfies the condition that must annihilate the vacuum, without affecting the time-evolution of operators via the above exponentiation operation. This subtraction of the zero-point energy may be considered to be a resolution of the quantum operator ordering ambiguity, since it is equivalent to requiring that &quot;all creation operators appear to the left of annihilation operators&quot; in the expansion of the Hamiltonian. This procedure is known as Wick ordering or normal ordering.

====Other fields====

All other fields can be quantized by a generalization of this procedure. Vector or tensor fields simply have more components, and independent creation and destruction operators must be introduced for each independent component. If a field has any internal symmetry, then creation and destruction operators must be introduced for each component of the field related to this symmetry as well. If there is a gauge symmetry, then the number of independent components of the field must be carefully analyzed to avoid over-counting equivalent configurations, and gauge-fixing may be applied if needed.

It turns out that commutation relations are useful only for quantizing &quot;bosons&quot;, for which the occupancy number of any state is unlimited. To quantize &quot;fermions&quot;, which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle, anti-commutators are needed. These are defined by .

When quantizing fermions, the fields are expanded in creation and annihilation operators, , , which satisfy
formula_80

The states are constructed on a vacuum formula_58 annihilated by the , and the Fock space is built by applying all products of creation operators to . Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle is satisfied, because formula_82, by virtue of the anti-commutation relations.

===Condensates===

The construction of the scalar field states above assumed that the potential was minimized at = 0, so that the vacuum minimizing the Hamiltonian satisfies , indicating that the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field is zero. In cases involving spontaneous symmetry breaking, it is possible to have a non-zero VEV, because the potential is minimized for a value = . This occurs for example, if with and , for which the minimum energy is found at . The value of in one of these vacua may be considered as &quot;condensate&quot; of the field . Canonical quantization then can be carried out for the &quot;shifted field&quot; , and particle states with respect to the shifted vacuum are defined by quantizing the shifted field. This construction is utilized in the Higgs mechanism in the standard model of particle physics.

==Mathematical quantization==
===Deformation quantization===
The classical theory is described using a spacelike foliation of spacetime with the state at each slice being described by an element of a symplectic manifold with the time evolution given by the symplectomorphism generated by a Hamiltonian function over the symplectic manifold. The &quot;quantum algebra&quot; of &quot;operators&quot; is an -deformation of the algebra of smooth functions over the symplectic space such that the leading term in the Taylor expansion over of the commutator expressed in the phase space formulation is . (Here, the curly braces denote the Poisson bracket. The subleading terms are all encoded in the Moyal bracket, the suitable quantum deformation of the Poisson bracket.) In general, for the quantities (observables) involved,
and providing the arguments of such brackets, &quot;ħ&quot;-deformations are highly nonunique—quantization is an &quot;art&quot;, and is specified by the physical context.
(Two &quot;different&quot; quantum systems may represent two different, inequivalent, deformations of the same classical limit, .)

Now, one looks for unitary representations of this quantum algebra. With respect to such a unitary representation, a symplectomorphism in the classical theory would now deform to a (metaplectic) unitary transformation. In particular, the time evolution symplectomorphism generated by the classical Hamiltonian deforms to a unitary transformation generated by the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian.

A further generalization is to consider a Poisson manifold instead of a symplectic space for the classical theory and perform an &quot;ħ&quot;-deformation of the corresponding Poisson algebra or even Poisson supermanifolds.

===Geometric quantization===

In contrast to the theory of deformation quantization described above, geometric quantization seeks to construct an actual Hilbert space and operators on it. Starting with a symplectic manifold formula_83, one first constructs a prequantum Hilbert space consisting of the space of square-integrable sections of an appropriate line bundle over formula_83. On this space, one can map &quot;all&quot; classical observables to operators on the prequantum Hilbert space, with the commutator corresponding exactly to the Poisson bracket. The prequantum Hilbert space, however, is clearly too big to describe the quantization of formula_83.

One then proceeds by choosing a polarization, that is (roughly), a choice of formula_86 variables on the formula_87-dimensional phase space. The &quot;quantum&quot; Hilbert space is then the space of sections that depend only on the formula_86 chosen variables, in the sense that they are covariantly constant in the other formula_86 directions. If the chosen variables are real, we get something like the traditional Schrödinger Hilbert space. If the chosen variables are complex, we get something like the Segal–Bargmann space.

<text>Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden (, SSV) was a political party formed in 1921 after a split from the original SSV.

When the original SSV approved the 21 theses of the Communist International and in so doing changed its name to SKP (Communist Party of Sweden) in 1921, an anti-ComIntern minority was expelled and founded its own &quot;SSV&quot;. This &quot;SSV&quot; existed between 1921 and 1923. The leader of this party was Ivar Vennerström. &quot;SSV&quot; participated in two elections, the parliamentary election of 1921 and the municipal election of 1922. In 1923, it merged with the Social Democrats.

&quot;Västerbottens Folkblad&quot;, a newspaper published in Umeå, was then a publication of this tendency. Today it is a social democratic magazine.

<text>Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics was the sixteenth appearance of the sport of basketball as an official Olympic medal event. It took place at the Helliniko Olympic Indoor Arena, a part of the Hellinikon Olympic Complex, in Athens, for the preliminary rounds, with the later stages being held in the Olympic Indoor Hall at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex. 
Argentina, led by NBA standouts like Manu Ginóbili and Luis Scola, won the country&#x27;s first and only gold medal in the event.

In Olympic basketball tournaments, 12 teams take part. The host nation (Greece in 2004) automatically receives a berth in the tournament. By winning the two World Championship tournaments in 2002, FR Yugoslavia, now named Serbia and Montenegro, also put a team into the men&#x27;s tournament and the United States a team in the women&#x27;s tournament.

The remaining 10 spots in each tournament were allocated by the five Olympic zones. Each of these zones held its own tournaments to select its entries in the Olympic tournament. Africa was allocated one spot in each of these, Oceania was allocated two apiece, and Europe was allocated three. Furthermore, the Americas were allocated three teams for the men&#x27;s tournament and just one in the women&#x27;s tournament, whereas Asia was allocated just one in the men&#x27;s tournament and three in the women&#x27;s tournament.

The United States team&#x27;s third-place finish in the men&#x27;s tournament was an embarrassment for the country that birthed the sport. The following Summer Olympics, the U.S. was represented by the Redeem Team, sporting an improved roster led by international superstars like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade, under the coaching of Mike Krzyzewski, and returned the gold medal to America.

==Medalists==


== Qualification ==
A National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter just one men&#x27;s team with 12 players, and just one women&#x27;s team with 12 players in the regional tournaments. The reigning world champions and the host country qualify automatically, as do the winners of the five continental championships, plus the runner-up and third place teams from the Americas and Europe competitions, and the runner-up Oceania in the men&#x27;s tournament. For the women&#x27;s tournament, the extra teams consisted of the runner-up and third place teams from Asia and Europe, and the runner-up from Oceania.

== Format ==
* Twelve teams are split into two preliminary round groups of six teams each.
* The top four teams from both groups qualify for the knockout stage.
* Fifth-placed teams from both groups compete for 9th place in an additional match.
* Sixth-placed teams from both groups compete for 11th place in an additional match.
* In the quarterfinals, the matchups are as follows: A1 vs. B4, A2 vs. B3, A3 vs. B2 and A4 vs. B1.
** From the eliminated teams at the quarterfinals, the loser from A1 vs. B4 competes against the loser from B1 vs. A4 for 7th place in an additional match. The remaining two loser teams compete for 5th place in an additional match.
* The winning teams from the quarterfinals meet in the semifinals as follows: A1/B4 vs. A3/B2 and A2/B3 vs. A4/B1.
* The winning teams from the semifinals contest the gold medal. The losing teams contest the bronze.

Tie-breaking criteria:

# Head to head results
# Goal average (not the goal difference) between the tied teams
# Goal average of the tied teams for all teams in its group

<text>Jamming with Edward! is a 1972 album by three Rolling Stones band members (Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman) accompanied by Nicky Hopkins and Ry Cooder.

==Background==
The album was recorded at London&#x27;s Olympic Studio on April 23, 1969, during the &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; sessions, and released on Rolling Stones Records in 1972. It consists of a series of loose jams performed by band members while waiting for Keith Richards to return to the studio. The reason for Richards&#x27; absence is uncertain; although it is commonly believed that he walked out over Cooder being brought in as a support guitarist, producer Glyn Johns has attributed his absence to a phone call from his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg. Although &quot;Jamming with Edward!&quot; reached No. 33 on the US charts in February 1972 during an 11-week stay, it failed to make the UK listings.

&quot;Edward&quot; is a nickname for pianist Nicky Hopkins, originating from some earlier studio conversation between Hopkins and another Rolling Stone, Brian Jones. Hopkins also contributed the cover art. In the original liner notes, Mick Jagger describes the album as &quot;a nice piece of bullshit... which we cut one night in London, England while waiting for our guitar player to get out of bed. It was promptly forgotten (which may have been for the better) ... I hope you spend longer listening to this record than we did recording it.&quot; On the CD version there are additional notes written by Mark Paytress adding more context and describing the result as a &quot;curio to top all curios, perhaps&quot;.

Johns said of the album: &quot;[It] was just a joke really, just a laugh. I recorded it and they played it, and then, I don&#x27;t know how long later, we dug the tapes out, I mixed it and they stuck it out on album. It didn&#x27;t really warrant releasing really, but it was okay, a bit of fun, and there&#x27;s some good playing on it.&quot;

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the release was delayed for several months due to the appearance of an expletive on the back cover art, which was partially covered with stars in the ultimate release.

==Remaster==
&quot;Jamming with Edward!&quot; was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records in 1995.

<doc id="869600" wikidata="Q1065595" url="?curid=869600" title="Charles Murray (political scientist)">
<text>Charles Alan Murray (; born January 8, 1943) is an American political scientist. He is the W.H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.

Murray&#x27;s work is highly controversial. His book &quot;Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950–1980&quot; (1984) discussed the American welfare system. In the book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994), he and co-author Richard Herrnstein argue that in 20th-century American society, intelligence became a better predictor than parental socioeconomic status or education level of many individual outcomes, including income, job performance, pregnancy out of wedlock, and crime, and that social welfare programs and education efforts to improve social outcomes for the disadvantaged are largely counterproductive. &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; also argues that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups are at least partly genetic in origin, a view that is now considered discredited by mainstream science.

==Early life and education==
Of Scotch-Irish ancestry, Murray was born on January 8, 1943, in Newton, Iowa, and raised in a Republican, &quot;Norman Rockwell kind of family&quot; that stressed moral responsibility. He is the son of Frances B. (née Patrick) and Alan B. Murray, an executive for the Maytag Company. His youth was marked by a rebellious and pranksterish sensibility. As a teen, he played pool at a hangout for juvenile delinquents, developed debating skills, espoused labor unionism (to his parents&#x27; annoyance), and on one occasion helped burn a cross that he and his friends had erected near a police station.

Murray credits the SAT with helping him get out of Newton and into Harvard. &quot;Back in 1961, the test helped get me into Harvard from a small Iowa town by giving me a way to show that I could compete with applicants from Exeter and Andover,&quot; wrote Murray. &quot;Ever since, I have seen the SAT as the friend of the little guy, just as James Bryant Conant, president of Harvard, said it would be when he urged the SAT upon the nation in the 1940s.&quot; However, in a 2012 op-ed published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Murray argued in favor of removing the SAT&#x27;s role in college admissions, commenting that the SAT &quot;has become a symbol of new-upper-class privilege, as people assume (albeit wrongly) that high scores are purchased through the resources of private schools and expensive test preparation programs&quot;.

Murray earned a BA in history from Harvard University in 1965 and a PhD in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1974.

==Peace Corps==
Murray left for the Peace Corps in Thailand in 1965, staying abroad for six years. At the beginning of this period, Murray kindled a romance with his Thai Buddhist language instructor (in Hawaii), Suchart Dej-Udom, the daughter of a wealthy Thai businessman, who was &quot;born with one hand and a mind sharp enough to outscore the rest of the country on the college entrance exam&quot;. Murray subsequently proposed by mail from Thailand, and their marriage began the following year, a move that Murray now considers youthful rebellion. &quot;I&#x27;m getting married to a one-handed Thai Buddhist,&quot; he said. &quot;This was not the daughter-in-law that would have normally presented itself to an Iowa couple.&quot;

Murray credits his time in the Peace Corps in Thailand with his lifelong interest in Asia. &quot;There are aspects of Asian culture as it is lived that I still prefer to Western culture, 30 years after I last lived in Thailand,&quot; says Murray. &quot;Two of my children are half-Asian. Apart from those personal aspects, I have always thought that the Chinese and Japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains.&quot;

His tenure with the Peace Corps ended in 1968, and during the remainder of his time in Thailand he worked on an American Institutes for Research (AIR) covert counter-insurgency program for the US military in cooperation with the CIA.

Recalling his time in Thailand in a 2014 episode of &quot;Conversations with Bill Kristol&quot;, Murray commented that his worldview was fundamentally shaped by his time there, &quot;Essentially, most of what you read in my books I learned in Thai villages.&quot; He continued:, &quot;I suddenly was struck first by the enormous discrepancy between what Bangkok thought was important to the villagers and what the villagers wanted out of government. And the second thing I got out of it was that when the government change agent showed up, the village went to hell in terms of its internal governance.&quot;

Murray&#x27;s work in the Peace Corps and subsequent social research in Thailand for research firms associated with the US government led to the subject of his doctoral thesis in political science at MIT, in which he argued against bureaucratic intervention in the lives of Thai villagers.

==Divorce and remarriage==
By the 1980s, his marriage to Suchart Dej-Udom had been unhappy for years, but &quot;his childhood lessons on the importance of responsibility brought him slowly to the idea that divorce was an honorable alternative, especially with young children involved.&quot;

Murray divorced Dej-Udom after fourteen years of marriage and three years later married Catherine Bly Cox (born 1949, Newton, Iowa), an English literature instructor at Rutgers University. Cox was initially dubious when she saw his conservative reading choices, and she spent long hours &quot;trying to reconcile his shocking views with what she saw as his deep decency&quot;. In 1989, Murray and Cox co-authored a book on the Apollo program, &quot;Apollo: Race to the Moon&quot;. Murray attends and Cox is a member of a Quaker meeting in Virginia, and they live in Frederick County, Maryland near Washington, D.C.

Murray has four children, two by each wife. While his second wife, Catherine Bly Cox, had converted to Quakerism , Murray still considered himself an agnostic. Murray describes himself as a &quot;wannabe Christian&quot; who takes faith seriously but has yet to acquire deep faith.

==Research==
Murray continued research work at AIR, one of the largest of the private social science research organizations, upon his return to the US. From 1974 to 1981, Murray worked for the AIR eventually becoming chief political scientist. While at AIR, Murray supervised evaluations in the fields of urban education, welfare services, daycare, adolescent pregnancy, services for the elderly, and criminal justice.

From 1981 to 1990, he was a fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute where he wrote &quot;Losing Ground&quot;, which heavily influenced the welfare reform debate in 1996, and &quot;In Pursuit&quot;. He has been a fellow of the conservative American Enterprise Institute since 1990 and was a frequent contributor to &quot;The Public Interest&quot;, a journal of conservative politics and culture. In March 2009, he received AEI&#x27;s highest honor, the Irving Kristol Award. He has also received a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Universidad Francisco Marroquín. Murray has received grants from the conservative Bradley Foundation to support his scholarship, including the writing of &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;.

===&quot;Losing Ground&quot;===
Murray argues in his book &quot;Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950–1980&quot; (1984) that social welfare programs actually hurt society as a whole, as well as the very people those programs are trying to help, and concludes that these programs should therefore be eliminated. Murray proposes three &quot;laws&quot; of social programs to defend this policy prescription:
# &quot;Law of Imperfect Selection&quot;: Any objective rule that defines eligibility for a social transfer program will irrationally exclude some persons.
# &quot;Law of Unintended Rewards&quot;: Any social transfer increases the net value of being in the condition that prompted the transfer.
# &quot;Law of Net Harm&quot;: The less likely it is that the unwanted behavior will change voluntarily, the more likely it is that a program to induce change will cause net harm.

===&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;===
&quot;The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life&quot; (1994) is a controversial bestseller that Charles Murray wrote with Harvard professor Richard J. Herrnstein. The book&#x27;s title comes from the bell-shaped normal distribution of IQ scores. Its central thesis is that in American society in the 20th century intelligence had become a better predictor of many factors including income, job performance, unwed pregnancy, and crime than one&#x27;s parents&#x27; socio-economic status or education level. The book also argued that those with high intelligence (the &quot;cognitive elite&quot;) were becoming separated from those with average and below-average intelligence, and that this constituted a dangerous social trend. He also warned of a merger of the &quot;cognitive elite&quot; with the &quot;wealth elite&quot;, which would become increasingly isolated and could result in an authoritarian &quot;custodial state&quot;. After its publication, academics criticized the book over his assertions on race and IQ. Some said it supported long-discredited &quot;scientific racism&quot; and a number of books were written to rebut &quot;The Bell Curve.&quot; Those works included a 1996 edition of evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;; a collection of essays, &quot;The Bell Curve Wars&quot; (1995), reacting to Murray and Herrnstein&#x27;s commentary; and &quot;The Bell Curve Debate&quot; (1995), whose essays similarly respond to issues raised in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;. Arthur S. Goldberger and Charles F. Manski critiqued the empirical methods supporting the book&#x27;s hypotheses.

The book&#x27;s most controversial argument hinged on a hypothesized relationship between race and intelligence, specifically the hypothesis that differences in average IQ test performance between racial groups are at least partially genetic in origin. Subsequent developments in genetics research have led to a scholarly consensus that this hypothesis is false. The idea that there are genetically determined differences in intelligence between racial groups is now considered discredited by mainstream science.

Much of the work referenced by &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; was funded by the Pioneer Fund, which aims to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences, and which has been accused of promoting white supremacist views, particularly scientific racism. Murray criticized the characterization of the Pioneer Fund as a racist organization, arguing that it has as much relationship to its founder as &quot;Henry Ford and today&#x27;s Ford Foundation&quot;.

===&quot;Coming Apart&quot;===
In his bestseller &quot;Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010&quot; (2012), Murray describes diverging trends between poor and upper middle-class white Americans in the half-century after the death of John F. Kennedy. He focuses on white Americans in order to argue that economic decline in that period was not experienced solely by minorities, whom he brings into his argument in the last few chapters of the book. He argues that class strain has cleaved white Americans into two distinct, highly segregated strata: &quot;an upper class, defined by educational attainment, and a new lower class, characterized by the lack of it. Murray also posits that the new [white] &#x27;lower class&#x27; is less industrious, less likely to marry and raise children in a two-parent household, and more politically and socially disengaged.&quot;

Critics have suggested that he cherry-picked the data and time period under analysis, with Nell Irvin Painter, for example, writing that &quot;behaviors that seem to have begun in the 1960s belong to a much longer and more complex history than ideologically driven writers like Mr. Murray would have us believe.&quot;

===Op-ed writings===
Murray has written opinion pieces for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The Public Interest&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He has been a witness before United States House and Senate committees and a consultant to senior Republican government officials in the United States and other conservative officials in the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

In the April 2007 issue of &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, Murray wrote on the disproportionate representation of Jews in the ranks of outstanding achievers and says that one of the reasons is that they &quot;have been found to have an unusually high mean intelligence as measured by IQ tests since the first Jewish samples were tested&quot;. His article concludes with an assertion: &quot;At this point, I take sanctuary in my remaining hypothesis, uniquely parsimonious and happily irrefutable. The Jews are God&#x27;s chosen people.&quot;

In the July/August 2007 issue of &quot;The American&quot;, a magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, Murray says he has changed his mind about SAT tests and says they should be scrapped: &quot;Perhaps the SAT had made an important independent contribution to predicting college performance in earlier years, but by the time research was conducted in the last half of the 1990s, the test had already been ruined by political correctness.&quot; Murray advocates replacing the traditional SAT with the College Board&#x27;s subject achievement tests: &quot;The surprising empirical reality is that the SAT is redundant if students are required to take achievement tests.&quot;

==Public speech and protest at Middlebury College==

On March 2, 2017, Murray was scheduled to speak at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, about &quot;Coming Apart: the State of White America, 1960–2010&quot;. Murray was invited to attend the college by Middlebury&#x27;s American Enterprise Institute Club, who received co-sponsorship of the event from a professor in the political science department. Before Murray was able to speak, students within the hall rose to their feet and recited in unison a speech about the eugenicist implications of Murray&#x27;s work. Students proceeded to chant and dance in the hall in an effort to stop Murray from speaking. Bill Burger, Middlebury College&#x27;s Vice President of Communications, announced that the speech would be moved to another location. A closed circuit broadcast showed Murray being interviewed by political science professor Allison Stanger—chanting from protesters could be heard throughout the broadcast. After the interview, there was a violent confrontation between protesters—both from the college and the surrounding community—and Murray, Vice President for Communications Bill Burger, and Stanger (who was hospitalized with a neck injury and concussion) as they left the McCullough Student Center. Middlebury students said that Middlebury Public Safety officers instigated and escalated violence against nonviolent protesters and that administrator Bill Burger assaulted protesters with a car. Middlebury President Laurie L. Patton responded after the event, saying the school would respond to &quot;the clear violations of Middlebury College policy that occurred inside and outside Wilson Hall&quot;. The school took disciplinary action against 74 students for their involvement in the incident.

== Political views ==

Murray identifies as a libertarian. He has also been described as conservative, far-right, and as a white nationalist.

=== Education ===
Murray has been critical of the No Child Left Behind law, arguing that it &quot;set a goal that was devoid of any contact with reality... The United States Congress, acting with large bipartisan majorities, at the urging of the President, enacted as the law of the land that all children are to be above average.&quot; He sees the law as an example of &quot;Educational romanticism [which] asks too much from students at the bottom of the intellectual pile, asks the wrong things from those in the middle, and asks too little from those at the top.&quot;

Challenging &quot;educational romanticism&quot;, he wrote &quot;Real Education: Four Simple Truths for Bringing America&#x27;s Schools Back to Reality&quot;, making the argument for &quot;four simple truths&quot;, namely: ability varies, half of all children are below average, too many people are going to college, and that America&#x27;s future depends on how we educate the academically gifted.

In 2014, a speech that Murray was scheduled to give at Azusa Pacific University was &quot;postponed&quot; due to Murray&#x27;s research on human group differences. Murray responded to the institution by claiming that it was a disservice to the students and faculty to dismiss his research because of its controversial nature rather than the evidence. Murray also urged the university to consider his works as they are and reach conclusions for themselves, rather than relying on sources that &quot;specialize in libeling people&quot;.

=== Economics ===
Murray has indicated that he believes that the government is over regulated and has expressed support for disobeying regulations he considers to be unjust.

Murray supports having simpler tax codes and decreasing government benefits, which could incentivize childbearing. In June 2016, Murray wrote that replacing welfare with a universal basic income (UBI) was the best way to adapt to &quot;a radically changing U.S. jobs market&quot; and defended that, as of 2014, the annual cost of a UBI in the US would have been about $200 billion cheaper than the current system.

=== Abortion ===
During an appearance at CPAC, Murray said of abortions: &quot;It&#x27;s a murder—it&#x27;s a homicide—but sometimes homicide is justified&quot;. He has said that he believes that it is acceptable in certain situations including when a woman&#x27;s life is at risk and when there is severe damage to the brain of the child. Murray has also indicated that he thinks that conservatives should put social issues like abortion on the back burner and has said they should seek a &quot;moral suasion&quot; rather than criminalization of issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.

=== Race ===
In Murray book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; in chapters 13 and 14, where the authors wrote about the enduring differences in race and intelligence and discuss implications of that difference. They write in the introduction to chapter 13 that &quot;The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved,&quot; and that &quot;It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.&quot; This stands in contrast to the contemporary and subsequent consensus of mainstream researchers, who do not find that racial disparities in educational attainment or measured intelligence are explained by between-group genetic differences.

Citing assertions made by Murray in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;, The Southern Poverty Law Center labeled him a &quot;white nationalist&quot;, charging that his ideas were rooted in eugenics. Murray disputed this. Francis Wheen summarized Murray&#x27;s arguments as &quot;Black people are more stupid than white people: always have been, always will be. This is why they have less economic and social success. Since the fault lies in their genes, they are doomed to be at the bottom of the heap now and forever.&quot; Other intellectuals have defended Murray against allegations of racism, including Sam Harris, Glenn Loury, Andrew Sullivan, James Flynn, and Kyle Smith.

<text>Revolutionära Socialistiska Partiet (), a Swedish political party founded in 1945, as the Independent Labour Party (). It was founded by a group that had split from the Left Socialist Party (VSP), when VSP had developed in a pro-Western direction. Leaders included Evald Höglund and Gottfrid Nyberg.

OAP published two issues of &quot;Vårt Ord&quot;.

In 1949, the group was reconstructed as Revolutionary Socialists (&quot;Revolutionära Socialister&quot;). RS became the first Swedish section of the Fourth International. The following year it changed name to RSP at a conference in Stockholm. The group gathered around a dozen persons. 

RSP was active in the 1950 municipal elections in Stockholm (where they received 1,900 votes) and during the dockers&#x27; strike of 1951. RSP published two issues of &quot;Internationalen&quot;.

RSP was a short-lived party. Soon the leadership of FI ordered RSP to enter SAP and practice fraction politics, entryism, within this party. The members of RSP opposed this, and the organization was dissolved in 1953.

<doc id="869607" wikidata="Q2575434" url="?curid=869607" title="Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century">
<text>Duck Dodgers in the th Century (spoken as &quot;twenty-fourth-and-a-half&quot;) is a 1953 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The cartoon was released on July 25, 1953, and stars Daffy Duck as space hero Duck Dodgers, Porky Pig as his assistant, and Marvin the Martian as his opponent. This cartoon marked the first of many appearances of the Duck Dodgers character.

Marvin the Martian had been introduced as an unnamed villain in Warner&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Haredevil Hare&quot; (1948), playing opposite Bugs Bunny (Marvin would not receive his proper name until 1979). He was later given the title &#x27;Commander, Flying Saucer X-2&#x27; in 1952&#x27;s &quot;The Hasty Hare&quot;. The &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; cartoon is an extended parody of the pulp magazine, newspaper comic strip, and comic book character Buck Rogers, and his longtime run of space adventures, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;.

In 1994, &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; was voted #4 of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; of all time by members of the animation field. Because he was such a fan of the short in particular, &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas attempted to arrange that the short be shown before the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film during its initial run in theaters. In 2004 at the 62nd World Science Fiction Convention, it was retrospectively nominated for a Retro Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation—Short Form.

==Plot==
In the latter half of 24th century (around 2350), Duck Dodgers (Daffy Duck) is tasked with locating the uncharted &quot;Planet X&quot;, the only known remaining source for the dwindling element Illudium Phosdex, &quot;the shaving cream atom&quot;. After a few small mishaps, Dodgers and his assistant, the &quot;Eager Young Space Cadet&quot; (Porky Pig) set off by rocket. Once in flight, Dodgers plots what becomes an enormously complicated and inefficient course to Planet X, whereas the Cadet suggests a much simpler route, following a path of nearby planets bearing the letters of the alphabet (in order from A onward). After scoffing at the idea, Dodgers suddenly comes up with the same idea and takes credit for it. The ship then flies past the lettered planets and arrives on Planet X.

Dodgers immediately claims the planet in the name of the Earth, but is quickly greeted by Marvin the Martian, as he claims it in the name of Mars. In the ensuing battle, Dodgers is shot multiple times in the face and disintegrated and reintegrated once. The battle continues through most of the film, until Dodgers finally declares enough is enough, and deploys his &quot;secret weapon&quot; that surrounds Marvin&#x27;s ship with explosives. Marvin deploys the same type of weapon against Dodgers&#x27; ship. When the two simultaneously detonate their weapons, the entire planet is destroyed, save for a small chunk. Dodgers pushes Marvin off this chunk, and once again claims it in his own name, as the Cadet and Marvin are seen hanging from a root underneath the chunk. The Cadet sarcastically dismisses Dodgers&#x27; claim as a &quot;Big deal.&quot;

==Cast==
*Mel Blanc as Duck Dodgers, The Eager Young Space Cadet, Marvin the Martian and Dr. I.Q. Hi

==Credits==
The cartoon was directed by Chuck Jones (credited as Charles M. Jones), with the story by Michael Maltese, voices by Mel Blanc, and original music by Carl Stalling. The animation was credited to Lloyd Vaughan, Ken Harris and Ben Washam, with Harry Love receiving a credit for effects animation. The distinctive layouts were designed by Maurice Noble and the backgrounds produced by Phil DeGuard.

Uncredited are Stalling&#x27;s quotations of &quot;Powerhouse&quot; and &quot;Egyptian Barn Dance&quot; (in the opening credits), by Raymond Scott.

==Production==
Jones saw Porky Pig&#x27;s sidekick role as set apart from Daffy as the hero: &quot;I always felt that Porky Pig was the subtlest of all the characters because he was consciously playing a part. He&#x27;s obviously putting Daffy on, but it&#x27;s a very subtle thing. In &quot;Duck Dodgers in the th Century&quot;, he was playing the space cadet, but he was &quot;aware&quot; that he was playing it. He was like I would be in a class play — in which the hero really thought he was the character.&quot;

==Reception==
Comic book writer Mark Evanier writes, &quot;Director Chuck Jones and writer Mike Maltese inverted the usual cartoon convention of having the hero conquer the villain. Here, Daffy pretty much conquers himself with faulty disintegration rays and faultier personal swagger. As with the other times Jones handled the duck, the Oliver Hardy principle prevails: The joke is never the destruction that befalls the luckless character but their loss of dignity afterward.&quot;

<doc id="869611" wikidata="Q497851" url="?curid=869611" title="Andy Richter">
<text>Paul Andrew Richter (born October 28, 1966) is an American actor, comedian, writer, and talk show announcer. He is best known as the sidekick for Conan O&#x27;Brien on each of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s talk shows: &quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on NBC and &quot;Conan&quot; on TBS. He was also star of the Fox television series &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot;. He voiced Mort in the &quot;Madagascar&quot; film franchise and Ben Higgenbottom in the animated television series &quot;The Mighty B!&quot; on Nickelodeon.

==Early life==
Richter, the second of four children, was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to mother Glenda Swanson (née Palmer), a kitchen cabinet designer, and father Laurence R. Richter, who taught Russian at Indiana University for more than 32 years. Richter was raised in Yorkville, Illinois. He graduated from Yorkville High School in 1984, where he was elected Prom King. His parents divorced when he was 4 and his father later came out as bisexual. He is of Swedish and German descent.

==Career==

In the late 1980s, Richter attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and Columbia College Chicago as a film major. While at Columbia, he learned the basics of comedic acting and writing by starring in numerous student films and videos. After leaving Columbia in 1988, Richter worked as a production assistant on commercial shoots in Chicago. In 1989, he began taking classes at Chicago&#x27;s Improv Olympic. He went from student to &quot;House Performer&quot; within a year. Richter branched out working with &quot;The Comedy Underground&quot; and the Annoyance Theatre. Richter wrote for the short-lived Jonathan Brandmeier television show.

In the early 1990s, the Annoyance Theatre hit gold when producer Joey Soloway staged &quot;The Real Live Brady Bunch&quot; with live, word-for-word performances of the &#x27;70s sitcom. The show was so popular that it attracted national attention and moved to New York City. Richter was not an original member of the cast but the actor who played &quot;Mike Brady&quot; in the Chicago cast opted not to go to New York. Richter asked Soloway if he could play &quot;Mike&quot; in New York and, since Soloway had not cast a replacement, he agreed.

===&quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;===
At the same time &quot;The Real Live Brady Bunch&quot; was playing in New York, two fellow Annoyance members (Beth Cahill and Melanie Hutsell, who played Marcia and Jan Brady in the &quot;Real Live Brady Bunch&quot; stage show) were hired as cast members on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. With friends on &quot;SNL&quot;, Richter attended after-show parties, where he met &quot;SNL&quot; writer Robert Smigel. Two years later, Smigel hired Richter as a writer for a new show he was producing, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Smigel sent Richter to join Conan O&#x27;Brien on stage during a practice run-through when the production staff was testing lighting angles and sound, and noticed the two had a strong rapport. He became O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s sidekick just weeks before the show began airing in 1993.

Richter departed from &quot;Late Night&quot; after the show on May 26, 2000. He later said of the decision, &quot;After seven years of being on the show, I got itchy. I have a philosophy that if you enjoy good fortune, rather than sit there and say, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s fine, this amount is good enough for me,&quot; you should try and push it. You should see how much you can stretch your good fortune. And I was curious.&quot;

===After &quot;Late Night&quot;===
Richter left his post at &quot;Late Night&quot; in 2000 to pursue a career acting in films and television. His first major venture, Fox&#x27;s &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot;, was canceled after two mid-season runs. His next Fox sitcom, &quot;Quintuplets&quot;, lasted one season. His 2007 television series, &quot;Andy Barker P.I.&quot;, was co-written and executive produced by Conan O&#x27;Brien. In the series, Richter played an accountant who could not attract clients. After a woman comes to his office thinking he is the former tenant, a private investigator, she asks him to find her husband, who she thinks faked his death. Barker decides to pursue this job and becomes a private detective in earnest, and continues to do his accounting job, which seems to pick up as the series goes on. The series aired on NBC, with all six episodes in the first season on NBC.com. The series was canceled after very poor ratings, despite being named by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===
On February 24, 2009, it was announced that Richter would rejoin O&#x27;Brien as the announcer for &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in Los Angeles. Richter frequently appeared in comedy sketches on the show and often commented and interacted with Conan during the opening monologue; he was also part of the show&#x27;s writing staff. In mid-December 2009, Richter also began joining Conan on the couch during the celebrity interviews, much like he did in his former sidekick role on &quot;Late Night&quot;. Richter said he enjoyed having a steady paycheck again and not having to deal with production companies while developing television shows. Richter said, &quot;Now I&#x27;m so happy to be back and making TV every night, not asking permission from somebody and waiting six months to get their sparklingly clear and cogent notes. And then wait another month for them to get back from Hawaii and say, &#x27;Yes, now we can go make television.&#x27; I felt like a plumber who kept going into the building and saying, &#x27;Can we put some pipes together?&#x27; and watching my wrenches gather dust.&quot;

===&quot;Conan&quot;===
When Conan O&#x27;Brien returned to the air as host of &quot;Conan&quot; on TBS in 2010, Richter followed and resumed his roles as announcer, writer, general sidekick and participant in comedy sketches.

===&quot;The Three Questions with Andy Richter&quot;===

Since June 2019, Richter has his own podcast on the Earwolf network.

===Game shows===
In 2010, Richter was considered to be a potential host of the classic &quot;Pyramid&quot; game show that was being developed for CBS, but was ultimately not picked up by the network. Had the series been picked up, it would not have affected Richter&#x27;s role on &quot;Conan&quot;. On May 18, 2011, TBS announced development of a possible new version of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, again to be hosted by Richter.

In June 2010, Richter hosted the &quot;Team Coco Presents the Conan Writers Live&quot; comedy special for TBS at the Just for Laughs festival in Chicago. He hosted in place of O&#x27;Brien, who was prohibited from hosting any television program until fall 2010.

In July 2013, Richter signed up to host a game show called &quot;Step Up&quot;, which was ordered by Fox.

Richter holds the record for all-time highest one-day score on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;, winning $68,000 during a first-round game of the 2009–10 season&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational&quot;. His earnings were donated to the St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

In January 2017, he began hosting the ABC game show &quot;Big Fan&quot;.

In September 2022, Richter appeared on the series premiere of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;. He finished in second place, and won $30,000 for his charity The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.

===Other television appearances===
In April 2002, Richter appeared in the Fox series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. In &quot;Clip Show&quot;, he played a psychiatrist giving therapy to Malcolm, Reese, and Dewey.

In October 2005, Richter appeared in the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. In &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, he played an annoying blind date that was teased and misled by Grace Adler, who only dated him to prove she was not a snob.

Richter appeared in &quot;Monk&quot; as a murderer posing as Adrian Monk&#x27;s best friend in the episode &quot;Mr Monk Makes a Friend&quot;.

Richter appears in the Fox series &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in the 2006 episode &quot;S.O.B.s.&quot; He plays every member of a fictional group of identical Richter quintuplets: Donnie, Chareth, Rocky, Emmett, and himself. He reprises the roles in several episodes of season 4, which aired in 2013 on Netflix.

From 2006 to 2008, Richter had a recurring role as &quot;Sad Dad&quot; Stan in the TV show &quot;The New Adventures of Old Christine&quot;.

He also provided the voice of Ben on the animated series &quot;The Mighty B!&quot;, played Simon Cristini on &quot;True Jackson, VP&quot;, and reprises the voice of Mort on &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot; and &quot;All Hail King Julien&quot;.

Richter voiced himself in an episode of the 2021 Netflix animated sitcom &quot;Chicago Party Aunt&quot;.

In 2024, Richter competed in season twelve of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Dust Bunny&quot; and had Dick Van Dyke (who competed as &quot;Gnome&quot; in season nine) as his Mask Ambassador. He was eliminated in the Group B premiere &quot;Sports Night&quot;.

===Film===
In addition to his television work, Richter has appeared in motion pictures such as &quot;Aliens in the Attic&quot;, &quot;Big Trouble&quot;, &quot;Elf&quot;, &quot;Seeing Other People&quot;, &quot;New York Minute&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot;, the &quot;Madagascar&quot; franchise, &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Scary Movie 2&quot;, &quot;Frank McKlusky, C.I.&quot;, &quot;Pootie Tang&quot;, &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;, &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;, &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;, &quot;Lenny the Wonder Dog&quot;, &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; and &quot;Cabin Boy&quot;.

===Other appearances===
In 2008, Richter appeared in composer Marc Shaiman&#x27;s satirical mini-musical called &quot;Prop 8 — The Musical&quot;. The three-minute video was distributed on the internet at FunnyOrDie.com. In addition to Richter, the cast includes Jack Black, John C. Reilly, Craig Robinson, and many other celebrities, directed by Adam Shankman. The video won the 2009 Webby Award category Comedy: Individual Short or Episode, and won a GLAAD media award.

In July 2009, Richter played for the American League as a first baseman in the 2009 Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game. Representing the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Richter hit a home run in the game.

After the end of &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Richter joined O&#x27;Brien on his Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, a stage show touring the United States and Canada over the spring of 2010. Richter served in his usual role as announcer and sidekick. Due to performing with O&#x27;Brien, Richter was forced to drop out of the &quot;Jeopardy! Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational&quot;, in which he was a semifinalist. Isaac Mizrahi replaced Richter in the tournament. Richter also made an appearance on the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;The Suite Life on Deck&quot; as a non-religious hooded brother, Brother Theodore in the episode &quot;Silent Treatment&quot;.

In May 2021, Richter appeared on the Gus and Eddy Podcast hosted by comedy duo Gus Johnson and Eddy Burback.

==Personal life==
Richter was married to comedic actress and author Sarah Thyre from 1994 to 2019, and they have two children, a son born in 2000 and a daughter born in 2005. Thyre was a cast member on the comedy series &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;, on which Richter made frequent cameo appearances. Richter and Thyre also appeared together playing Hansel and Gretel in an episode of the &quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; sketch comedy series on Comedy Central in 1998. On April 13, 2019, Richter announced on his Twitter account that he and Thyre had separated and had begun divorce proceedings. In November 2022 he announced his engagement to Jennifer Herrera. They got married on June 10, 2023, in West Hollywood, with Conan O&#x27;Brien officiating.

Richter is a supporter of Planned Parenthood. At a fundraiser in 2016, he referenced abortion services provided in 1992 for Thyre when the couple had split and were each undergoing great personal difficulties. He stated that although they were very sad about the situation, they both knew it was the right decision for them. He also said that he is &quot;eternally grateful&quot; to the organization for allowing them to care for themselves and also for the ability to choose the time to bring children into their lives. The couple had been married 22 years at the time of his statements.

Richter is a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. After leaving &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, he moved to Los Angeles.

On April 15, 2019, Richter joined other writers in firing their agents as part of the WGA&#x27;s stand against the ATA and against film packaging, which they believed to be an unfair practice.

<text>Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was the personal-computer system research-and-development arm of Intel during the 1990s.

== History and formation ==
IAL was created by Intel Vice-president Ron Whittier together with Craig Kinnie and Steven McGeady to develop the hardware and software innovations considered to be lacking from PC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and Microsoft in the late 1980s and 1990s. IAL pursued both hardware and software initiatives, both of which were important factors in the evolution of, and the control of, the PC industry.

== Rivalry with Microsoft ==
Around the same time in the PC industry, Microsoft was emerging as the de facto industry standard in PC Operating Systems and software application for the PC. As IAL&#x27;s software ambitions began to overlap with Microsoft&#x27;s, a rivalry broke out between Intel and Microsoft as it related to the amount of influence, control, and the setting of standards in the rapidly growing PC industry. Over time, IAL&#x27;s work in software projects was gradually de-emphasized after the software efforts collided with similar activities by Microsoft.

=== Native Signal Processing (NSP) ===
Native Signal Processing (NSP) was an example of a significant software effort in IAL. NSP was a software initiative to allow Intel-based PCs to run time-sensitive code independently of the operating system (OS), allowing real-time audio and video processing on the microprocessors of the mid-1990s. Intel, whose microprocessors powered PC hardware designs, invested heavily in improving the performance of its chips. As a result of the increase in performance, Intel saw an opportunity to transfer software workloads from specialized microprocessors over to the central Intel microprocessors. This strategy was fundamental to Intel&#x27;s vision of a powerful central microprocessor made with its advanced chip building capabilities. NSP was, in that regard, a gold mine of power-hungry software workloads which were previously running on Digital Signal Processor chips. This led to IAL&#x27;s decision to embark on NSP, a large software initiative to gradually move the algorithms and software implementations from DSPs to the central Intel microprocessor.

IAL&#x27;s decision to pursue NSP clashed with a similar project that was brewing at Microsoft. NSP&#x27;s software architecture was designed to be agnostic of the software operating system. This was a common strategic direction with PC chip manufacturers in the 1980s and 1990s because it allowed chips to be used in a multitude of software operating environments, and not just the Microsoft operating systems such as Microsoft Windows. Microsoft&#x27;s equivalent project to IAL&#x27;s NSP was called Direct Show, and at the outset of NSP, this posed a conflict and a challenge for the working relationship between Intel and Microsoft (traditionally very close partners with highly aligned interests). When Intel proposed the NSP software design to Microsoft, it became clear that the two initiatives (NSP &amp; Direct X) were in direct conflict. Microsoft refused to put their support behind a competing standard such as NSP, especially one with the potential to level the OS playing field for PCs. Despite this conflict, IAL continued to work on NSP, showing demonstrations of DSP software running smoothly on the central microprocessor. With every generation of performance and functionality improvements, Microsoft refused to support NSP in its operating systems. Microsoft and Intel, both large and influential companies who worked with the same PC OEMs found themselves at odds over the direction of the software and hardware in the PC industry. Microsoft convinced PC makers that the Intel NSP device drivers would render their systems unsupported by the Windows operating system, and in turn this led Intel to pull back from promoting the software, leaving NSP as an orphan project. Although NSP did not achieve commercial success like Direct X, the concepts, prototypes, and implementations of DSP algorithms on native Intel microprocessors was widely recognized as an impressive technological feat at the time, and indirectly supported the overall notion of moving dedicated software workloads to general purpose microprocessors like Intel&#x27;s.

=== Web browser ===
IAL also tangled with Microsoft by supporting Netscape and their early web browser Netscape Navigator, and by producing a fast native x86 port of the Java system. Most of these projects were later shelved, and after 1997, IAL tended not to risk competing with Microsoft. The details of IAL&#x27;s conflicts with Microsoft over software were revealed in Steven McGeady&#x27;s testimony in the Microsoft antitrust trial.

Not all of IAL&#x27;s software efforts met bad ends due to Microsoft—IAL developed one of the first software digital video systems, Indeo - technology that was used in its ProShare videoconferencing product line but suffered later from neglect and was sold to another company in the late 1990s.

== Input/output interconnect projects ==
However, IAL successes in the hardware world are legendary, and include PCI, USB, AGP, the Northbridge/Southbridge core logic architecture and PCI Express.

=== Universal Serial Bus (USB) ===

USB, in particular, was developed in the Oregon offices of IAL, where the architects of PCI and the Plug and Play initiatives assisted in building the first peripheral interconnect that would work with devices without requiring the PC to be dismantled. This vision of a sealed PC that could be extended with external devices was central to Intel&#x27;s strategy of making the PC more like a consumer device. USB emerged as the lead contender for the interconnect standard interface, and an Intel team of engineers set out to create an industry standard.

Intel&#x27;s engineering standards were well known as being among the highest in the industry, driven by the company&#x27;s adherence to careful development of technical specifications before setting out to design or develop a new product. As part of the engineering process, Intel engineers wrote detailed technical specifications during the early phases of design, to ensure the features were well understood and agreed upon. Since Intel&#x27;s products usually involved complex chip designs, errors or omissions in the design or features could prove costly if done without the appropriate rigor and review that came along with the detailed engineering reviews that accompanied the design process.

In the early 1990s the initial USB specification was spearheaded in IAL, driven by a small team of software and hardware architects &amp; engineers. The engineers were scattered across Intel campuses in Oregon and California. In Oregon, the chief engineers of the USB project in IAL included Brad Hosler, Shelagh Callahan, John Howard, John Garney, and Kosar Jaff, all based in the Hillsboro Oregon Intel site.

While the IAL-based USB team was primarily located in Intel&#x27;s campus in Hillsboro Oregon, the USB project also included a team of chip designers in the Intel Chipset Group (Peripheral Components Division) located on the Intel campus in Folsom, California. The partnership between the IAL engineers and the chipset engineers was crucial in the development of the original USB specification. Throughout the development of the USB 1.0 specifications, the IAL engineers worked closely with chipset designers (inside and outside Intel). Together, the engineering teams in Oregon and California were tasked with building the world&#x27;s first USB based computer by designing and manufacturing the USB Host Controller.

==== USB host controller design ====
A critical component of the USB design was the interface between hardware and software, which was the domain of the USB Host Controller, the brains behind the interconnect that all USB devices communicate with. The USB Host Controller was embedded in the South Bridge chip, and was designed to match the USB specification being developed by the IAL engineers. USB was, like PCI, a unique combination of hardware and software definitions, and as a result the project needed a software engineering team from the outset, unlike typical Intel hardware 
projects. The USB software device driver &quot;stack&quot; was initially developed on Windows 95 using the Virtual Device Driver (VxD) model of Windows 95. The VxD-based USB driver stack was helpful to Microsoft as they implemented a brand new USB stack using the emerging Windows Driver Model (WDM) largely because of Microsoft&#x27;s strategic shift towards Windows NT, and away from Windows 95. WDM was uniquely compatible with both operating systems, and the decision to abandon the VxD stack was a win-win for Intel and Microsoft. The collaboration between IAL and Microsoft improved during the development of USB 1.0, largely driven by the software developers that Intel hired into its IAL labs. Software developers at Microsoft were able to speak a familiar technical language with their fellow software developers from IAL, allowing the group to work as a single unit to drive the USB standard into the Windows-based PCs of the 1990s and beyond.

==== Collaboration with industry partners ====
Unlike previous IAL projects which had resulted in considerable conflict and tension with other companies in the PC industry, the USB project stood out as a highlight of the cooperation between IAL&#x27;s engineers and the rest of the PC industry. The IAL USB team worked closely with Microsoft, sharing their lessons learned, and helping the Microsoft team add support for the USB interconnect in Windows, as well as in Microsoft peripheral devices, such as Microsoft keyboards. The IAL team dedicated a full time engineer to work with Microsoft closely so as to avoid delays and repeating mistakes the Intel team had made during the development of the specification and first hardware and software implementations. The USB team in IAL, while small and focused, developed a reputation for being collaborative, supportive, and focused on educating the industry about the emerging USB standard. The engineers were regular presenters at USB Developer&#x27;s Conferences and collaborated with dozens of hardware and software companies who were eager to implement the industry&#x27;s first broadly-adopted interconnect standard to make PCs more user friendly.

== Disbanding ==
In 2001, after the departure of all of its creators, IAL was disbanded and replaced with the very different Intel Labs under Pat Gelsinger, though most of the creative talent that had been in IAL was by then scattered across the company or had left entirely. In a 2005 re-organization, Intel Labs itself was reorganized with the intent of rebuilding a research function.

<text>In common law systems, land tenure, from the French verb &quot;&quot; means &quot;to hold&quot;, is the legal regime in which land &quot;owned&quot; by an individual is possessed by someone else who is said to &quot;hold&quot; the land, based on an agreement between both individuals. It determines who can use land, for how long and under what conditions. Tenure may be based both on official laws and policies, and on informal local customs (insofar higher law does allow that). In other words, land tenure implies a system according to which land is held by an individual or the actual tiller of the land but this person does not have legal ownership.
It determines the holder&#x27;s rights and responsibilities in connection with their holding. The sovereign monarch, known in England as the Crown, held land in its own right. All land holders are either its tenants or sub-tenants. &quot;Tenure&quot; signifies a legal relationship between tenant and lord, arranging the duties and rights of tenant and lord in relationship to the land. Over history, many different forms of land tenure, i.e., ways of holding land, have been established.

A landowner is the holder of the estate in land with the most extensive and exclusive rights of ownership over the territory, simply put, the owner of land.

==Feudal tenure==

The legal concept of land tenure in the Middle Ages has become known as the feudal system that has been widely used throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia Minor. The lords who received land directly from the Crown, or another landowner, in exchange for certain rights and obligations were called tenants-in-chief. 

They doled out portions of their land to lesser tenants who in turn divided it among even lesser tenants. This process—that of granting subordinate tenancies—is known as subinfeudation. In this way, all individuals except the monarch did hold the land &quot;of&quot; someone else because legal ownership was with the (superior) monarch, also known as 
overlord or 
suzerain.

Historically, it was usual for there to be reciprocal duties and rights between lord and tenant. There were different kinds of tenure to fit various kinds of need. For instance, a military tenure might be by knight-service, requiring the tenant to supply the lord with a number of armed horsemen and ground troops. 

The fees were often lands, land revenue or revenue-producing real property, typically known as fiefs or fiefdoms. Over the ages and depending on the region a broad variety of customs did develop based on the same legal principle. The famous Magna Carta for instance was a legal contract based on the medieval system of land tenure.

The concept of tenure has since evolved into other forms, such as leases and estates.

== Modes of ownership and tenure ==
There is a great variety of modes of land ownership and tenure.

===Traditional land tenure===
Most of the indigenous nations or tribes of North America had differing notions of land ownership. Whereas European land ownership centered around control, Indigenous notions were based on stewardship. When Europeans first came to North America, they sometimes disregarded traditional land tenure and simply seized land, or they accommodated traditional land tenure by recognizing it as aboriginal title. This theory formed the basis for treaties with indigenous peoples.

===Ownership of land by swearing to make productive use of it===
In several developing countries, such as Egypt and Senegal, this method is still presently in use. In Senegal, it is mentioned as &quot;mise en valeur des zones du terroir&quot; and in Egypt, it is called Wadaa al-yad.

===Allodial title===
Allodial title is a system in which real property is owned absolutely free and clear of any superior landlord or sovereign. True allodial title is rare, with most property ownership in the common law world (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States) being in fee simple. Allodial title is inalienable, in that it may be conveyed, devised, gifted, or mortgaged by the owner, but it may not be distressed and restrained for collection of taxes or private debts, or condemned (eminent domain) by the government.

===Feudal land tenure===
Feudal land tenure is a system of mutual obligations under which a royal or noble personage granted a fiefdom — some degree of interest in the use or revenues of a given parcel of land — in exchange for a claim on services such as military service or simply maintenance of the land in which the lord continued to have an interest. This pattern obtained from the level of high nobility as vassals of a monarch down to lesser nobility whose only vassals were their serfs.

===Fee simple===
Under common law, Fee simple is the most complete ownership interest one can have in real property, other than the rare Allodial title. The holder can typically freely sell or otherwise transfer that interest or use it to secure a mortgage loan. This picture of &quot;complete ownership&quot; is, of course, complicated by the obligation in most places to pay a property tax and by the fact that if the land is mortgaged, there will be a claim on it in the form of a lien. In modern societies, this is the most common form of land ownership. Land can also be owned by more than one party and there are various concurrent estate rules.

===Native title===
In Australia, native title is a common law concept that recognizes that some indigenous people have certain land rights that derive from their traditional laws and customs. Native title can co-exist with non-indigenous proprietary rights and in some cases different indigenous groups can exercise their native title over the same land. There are approximately 160 registered determinations of native title, spanning some 16% of Australia&#x27;s land mass. The case of Mabo overturned the decision in Milirrpum and repudiated the notion of terra nullius. Subsequent Parliamentary Acts passed recognised the existence of this common law doctrine.

===Life estate===
Under common law, Life estate is an interest in real property that ends at death. The holder has the use of the land for life, but typically no ability to transfer that interest or to use it to secure a mortgage loan.

===Fee tail===
Under common law, fee tail is hereditary, non-transferable ownership of real property. A similar concept, the &quot;legitime&quot;, exists in civil and Roman law; the &quot;legitime&quot; limits the extent to which one may disinherit an heir.

===Leasehold===
Under both common law and civil law, land may be leased or rented by its owner to another party. A wide range of arrangements are possible, ranging from very short terms to the 99-year leases common in the United Kingdom for flats, and allowing various degrees of freedom in the use of the property.

===Common land===
Rights to use a common may include such rights as the use of a road or the right to graze one&#x27;s animals on commonly owned land.

===Sharecropping===
When sharecropping, one has use of agricultural land owned by another person in exchange for a share of the resulting crop or livestock.

===Easement===
Easements allow one to make certain specific uses of land owned by someone else. The most classic easement is right-of-way (right to cross), but it could also include (for example) the rightknown as a wayleave to run an electrical power line across someone else&#x27;s land.

===Other===
In addition, there are various forms of collective ownership, which typically take either the form of membership in a cooperative, or shares in a corporation, which owns the land (typically by fee simple, but possibly under other arrangements). There are also various hybrids; in many communist states, government ownership of most agricultural land has combined in various ways with tenure for farming collectives.

== In archaeology ==
In archaeology, traditions of land tenure can be studied according to territoriality and through the ways in which people create and utilize landscape boundaries, both natural and constructed. Less tangible aspects of tenure are harder to qualify, and study of these relies heavily on either the anthropological record (in the case of pre-literate societies) or textual evidence (in the case of literate societies).

In archaeology, land tenure traditions can be studied across the longue durée, for example land tenure based on kinship and collective property management. This makes it possible to study the long-term consequences of change and development in land tenure systems and agricultural productivity.

Moreover, an archaeological approach to land tenure arrangements studies the temporal aspects of land governance, including their sometimes temporary, impermanent and negotiable aspects as well as uses of past forms of tenure. For example, people can lay claim to, or profess to own resources, through reference to ancestral memory within society. In these cases, the nature of and relationships with aspects of the past, both tangible (e.g. monuments) and intangible (e.g. concepts of history through story telling) are used to legitimize the present.

== Importance of tenure today ==

With homelessness and wealth inequality on the rise, land tenure in the developed world has become a point of issue. Market-based economies which treat housing as a commodity and not a right allow for laws such as California Proposition 13 (1978) that incentivize treating housing as an investment. Due to inelastic demand of the human need for shelter, housing prices can therefore be raised above universally-affordable rates. This complicates tenure by limiting supply and exacerbating homelessness and informal housing arrangements. For instance, in the United States, minimal regulation on house flipping and rent-seeking behavior allows for gentrification, pricing out half a million Americans and leaving them homeless. This is in light of 17 million homes left vacant as investment vehicles of the wealthy.

At the same time, severe weather events caused by climate-change have become more frequent, affecting property values.

In the developing world, catastrophes are impacting greater numbers of people due to urbanization, crowding, and weak tenure and legal systems.

Colonial land-tenure systems have led to issues in post-colonial societies.

The concepts of &quot;landlord&quot; and &quot;tenant&quot; have been recycled to refer to the modern relationship of the parties to land which is held under a lease. Professor F.H. Lawson in &quot;Introduction to the Laws of Property&quot; (1958) has pointed out, however, that the landlord-tenant relationship never really fitted in the feudal system and was rather an &quot;alien commercial element&quot;.

The doctrine of tenure did not apply to personalty (personal property). However, the relationship of bailment in the case of chattels closely resembles the landlord-tenant relationship that can be created in land.

Secure land-tenure also recognizes one&#x27;s legal residential status in urban areas and it is a key characteristic in slums. Slum-dwellers do not have legal title to the land and thus local governments usually marginalize and ignored them.

In 2012, the Committee on World Food Security based at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure as the global norm, as the problem of poor and politically marginalized especially likely to suffer from insecure tenure, however, this is merely work in progress. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 5 also advocates for reforms to give women access to ownership and control over land in recognition of the importance of tenure to resource distribution.

<text>Kommunistiska Enhetsgrupperna () was a section that left &quot;Kommunistiska Partiet Marxist-Leninisterna (revolutionärerna)&quot; in 1975. KEG considered that KPML(r):s politics towards the trade unions was ultra-leftist and sectarian. KEG was dissolved in 1977, and most of the members later joined SKP.

The KEG group in Stockholm, &quot;Stockholms Kommunistiska Enhetsgrupp&quot;, continued to exist until 1979. In that year SKEG merged with the Communist Association of Norrköping to form SKF-ml.

KEG published &quot;Enhet&quot; (&#x27;Unity&#x27;) 1975–1977.

<text>The Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license by Wizards of the Coast that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works.

==Language of the license==
The OGL states that &quot;in consideration for agreeing to use this License, the Contributors grant You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive license with the exact terms of this License to Use, the Open Game Content&quot;. The OGL defines two forms of content:

;Open Game Content (OGC)
:...the game mechanic and includes the methods, procedures, processes and routines to the extent such content does not embody the Product Identity and is an enhancement over the prior art and any additional content clearly identified as Open Game Content by the Contributor, and means any work covered by this License, including translations and derivative works under copyright law, but specifically excludes Product Identity...
;Product Identity (PI)
:...product and product line names, logos and identifying marks including trade dress; artifacts; creatures characters; stories, storylines, plots, thematic elements, dialogue, incidents, language, artwork, symbols, designs, depictions, likenesses, formats, poses, concepts, themes and graphic, photographic and other visual or audio representations; names and descriptions of characters, spells, enchantments, personalities, teams, personas, likenesses and special abilities; places, locations, environments, creatures, equipment, magical or supernatural abilities or effects, logos, symbols, or graphic designs; and any other trademark or registered trademark...

Use of another company&#x27;s Product Identity is considered breach of the licensing agreement.

== History ==
===3rd Edition===
The OGL (v1.0a) was originally published by Wizards of the Coast in 2000 to license the use of portions of the third edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, via a System Reference Document (SRD), thus allowing third-party publishers to produce compatible material. The SRD &quot;included the basic rules and elements of D&amp;D, such as classes, monsters, spells, and magic items, enabling the creation of legal support products for the game&quot;. This move was spearheaded by Ryan Dancey and it was &quot;modeled on the various open-source licenses used in the software industry&quot;. Publishers could also use the separate d20 System Trademark License to include a logo indicating compatibility. In an interview, Dancey stated:I think there&#x27;s a very, very strong business case that can be made for the idea of embracing the ideas at the heart of the Open Source movement and finding a place for them in gaming. [...] One of my fundamental arguments is that by pursuing the Open Gaming concept, Wizards can establish a clear policy on what it will, and will not allow people to do with its copyrighted materials. Just that alone should spur a huge surge in independent content creation that will feed into the D&amp;D network.Academics Benoît Demil and Xavier Lecocq, in the economic journal &quot;Revue d&#x27;économie industrielle&quot;, highlighted that a business goal of the OGL was to have competitors institutionalize a standardized rule system – &quot;if WOTC could get more people in the industry to use the same system, players would learn only one system and be able to migrate from product to product and game to game without learning and transaction costs. While it would reduce the number of original gaming systems in the market, the idea was to increase the audience for everybody, especially for the leader. The ultimate goal was to establish &#x27;d20&#x27; as a recognizable trademark, like &#x27;VHS&#x27; or &#x27;DVD&#x27;&quot;.

In 2004, Wizards of the Coast addressed what would occur if the license was changed – the OGL &quot;already defines what will happen to content that has been previously distributed using an earlier version, in Section 9. As a result, even if Wizards made a change you disagreed with, you could continue to use an earlier, acceptable version at your option. In other words, there&#x27;s no reason for Wizards to ever make a change that the community of people using the Open Gaming License would object to, because the community would just ignore the change anyway&quot;.

===4th Edition===
In June 2008, Wizards of the Coast transitioned to a new, more restrictive royalty-free license called the Game System License (GSL), which is available for third-party developers to publish products compatible with &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition. The GSL is incompatible with the previous OGL. However, by its own terms the OGL is perpetual, and remained in widespread use.
Greg Tito, for &quot;The Escapist&quot; in 2011, commented that the GSL &quot;released in conjunction with 4th edition took away many of the freedoms that the industry had come to expect with the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules, such as reprinting text for clarity in new products&quot;. Andy Collins, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; designer who became the &quot;Design &amp; Development Manager around the release of 4th edition&quot;, stated that:I remember arguing pretty hard to retain something like what Wizards had done for 3rd edition; an open license that included the core rules and a few basic guidelines on how to use it. I argued that without some kind of OGL, Wizards risked leaving behind the body of customers and potential customers who saw the open license as an assumed part of the D&amp;D. [...] In hindsight, I wonder if it might simply have been better to [let the OGL die] rather than guilting the company into crafting a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster of an open license that ended up pleasing basically nobody.

===5th Edition===

On January 12, 2016, Wizards of the Coast released the 5th Edition SRD under v1.0a of the OGL, marking a return to the Open Gaming format. This SRD was later revised and rereleased as SRD 5.1 in May 2016.

Content creators can alternatively utilize a different licensing option by publishing through the Dungeon Masters Guild storefront; this license allows individuals and third party publishers to create and sell content based on specific Wizards of the Coast intellectual property such as the Forgotten Realms, Ravenloft, Eberron, and the &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; planes. Content creators are allowed to set their own price, however, Wizards of the Coast and OneBookShelf take a 50% cut of the proceeds.

=== &quot;One D&amp;D&quot; ===
In August 2022, Wizards of the Coast launched a public playtest of the next version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; under the &quot;One D&amp;D&quot; initiative. In November 2022, there was reported speculation that the OGL would be discontinued for this new iteration of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; based on unconfirmed leaks. In response to the speculation, Wizards of the Coast stated in November 2022: &quot;We will continue to support the thousands of creators making third-party D&amp;D content with the release of One D&amp;D in 2024. While it is certain our Open Game License (OGL) will continue to evolve, just as it has since its inception, we&#x27;re too early in the development of One D&amp;D to give more specifics on the OGL or System Reference Document (SRD) at this time&quot;.

Following concerns raised by third-party &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; creators on the potential changes to the OGL, in December 2022, Wizards of the Coast released additional details on the proposed OGL 1.1 which would have gone into effect in 2023. It would have clarified that it only applies to &quot;printed media or static electronic files (like epubs and PDFs)&quot; and &quot;only covers material created for use in or as TTRPGs&quot;; OGL 1.1 would not cover other content such as video games or virtual tabletops (VTTs). Content creators using OGL 1.1 would have been required &quot;to put an official OGL badge on their products&quot;. Revenue related to OGL content would have been reported to Wizards of the Coast if that revenue exceeds $50,000 annually; creators who make at least $750,000 in income annually will be required to pay a royalty starting in 2024.

Lin Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot; in January 2023, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL1.0. Codega explained that while the original OGL granted a &quot;perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license&quot; it also included language around authorized versions of the license and &quot;according to attorneys consulted for this article, the new language may indicate that Wizards of the Coast is rendering any future use of the original OGL void, and asserting that if anyone wants to continue to use Open Game Content of any kind, they will need to abide by the terms of the updated OGL, which is a far more restrictive agreement than the original OGL&quot;. The document also states that the intention of the OGL was not &quot;to fund major competitors and it wasn&#x27;t intended to allow people to make D&amp;D apps, videos, or anything other than printed (or printable) materials for use while gaming&quot;. In a statement to EN World, Dancey, former VP of Wizards of the Coast and the architect of OGL1.0, said, &quot;my public opinion is that Hasbro does not have the power to deauthorize a version of the OGL. If that had been a power that we wanted to reserve for Hasbro, we would have enumerated it in the license. I am on record numerous places in email and blogs and interviews saying that the license could never be revoked&quot;.

Following an apology issued by Wizards of the Coast, the company released a new draft titled OGL 1.2 for public comment on January 19. It would have put some of the &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; mechanics under a Creative Commons license, while other material would have been covered by OGL 1.2. For example, &quot;specific classes, spells, and monsters&quot; would have fallen under the proposed OGL 1.2 while &quot;Alignment, Equipment, Feats, the use of Ability Scores, Combat Rules, how Spellcasting works, how monster stat blocks work, and Conditions will have been covered under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International&quot;. Unlike the leaked OGL 1.1, the proposed OGL 1.2 contained &quot;no royalty payment, no financial reporting, no license-back, no registration, no distinction between commercial and non-commercial&quot;. The proposed OGL 1.2 would have de-authorized the OGL1.0a; it would also be &quot;irrevocable, although there&#x27;s still a severability clause should a part of the license is held to be unenforceable or invalid&quot;. Along with the proposed OGL 1.2, Wizards released a separate virtual tabletop (VTT) policy.

On January 27, 2023, Wizards of the Coast announced that following feedback during the open comment for OGL1.2 they had decided to release the (SRD 5.1) under an irrevocable Creative Commons license (CC-BY-4.0) effective immediately and would no longer pursue deauthorizing the OGL1.0a.

== Reception ==

=== Open Game License ===
Those individuals, groups and publishing companies that license their works under the OGL and similar documents are sometimes collectively referred to as the &quot;open gaming movement&quot;. The OGL led to the development of the stand-alone &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; which is a modified version of the 3.5 game. James Maliszewski, for &quot;The Escapist&quot;, commented that the OGL also helped launch the Old School Revival movement and that &quot;by 2002, the idea of using the SRD to reverse engineer the out-of-print &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; took root on Dragonsfoot and other old school forums&quot;.

Academics Benoît Demil and Xavier Lecocq, in the economic journal &quot;Revue d&#x27;économie industrielle&quot; in 2014, stated that the OGL had an immediate impact on the tabletop role-playing industry with an increase in new TTRP publications where the &quot;majority of the new entrants adopted&quot; the d20 license; d20 products sold at a higher rate than non-d20 products until the mid 2000s. It &quot;was considered by WOTC&#x27;s managers as a huge success due to the large movement of adoption it created among publishers&quot;. They also highlighted that the &quot;success was amplified by the rise of electronic publishing&quot;.

Christopher B. Seaman and Thuan Tran, for the academic journal &quot;Iowa Law Review&quot; in 2022, highlighted that the release of the OGL &quot;created a major shift in the RPG industry&quot; and &quot;led to a boom in the RPG industry in the early 2000s&quot;. They commented that &quot;the emergence of open source licensing for RPGs facilitates user creativity and innovation, as dozens of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-compatible supplements have been created under the Open Game License&quot;.

Kit Walsh, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2023, highlighted that roleplaying games have aspects that are copyrightable, such as creative expression, and aspects that are not, such as functional descriptions of game mechanics. Walsh commented that the original OGL &quot;is very narrow&quot; and includes &quot;elements that are not copyrightable in the first place&quot; – agreeing to the OGL &quot;almost certainly means you have rights to use elements of Dungeons and Dragons than you would otherwise. For example, absent this agreement, you have a legal right to create a work using noncopyrightable elements of D&amp;D or making fair use of copyrightable elements&quot;. However, Walsh highlights the &quot;primary benefit&quot; is knowing the exact terms in order to not be sued by Wizards of the Coast and avoiding &quot;having to prove your fair use rights or engage in an expensive legal battle over copyrightability in court&quot;. Walsh stated that &quot;open licenses can involve a lot of legalese that makes them hard for a layperson to understand&quot; and explained that &quot;perpetual&quot; and &quot;irrevocable&quot; are separate legal terms; while the OGL states it is perpetual, it does not state that it is irrevocable. In an update to the article, Walsh wrote that past statements by Wizards of the Coast make &quot;very clear that Wizards always thought of this as a contract with obligations for both sides [...]. Unlike a bare license without consideration, an offer to contract like this cannot be revoked unilaterally once it has been accepted, under the law of Washington (where they are located) and other states&quot;. Walsh stated that works already published &quot;under OGL 1.0a are entitled to the benefit Wizards of the Coast promised them under that contract. But Wizards can revoke the offer of the OGL 1.0a as to new potential users who haven&#x27;t yet accepted its terms&quot;. Kyle Orland, for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, highlighted Walsh&#x27;s analysis and commented that the &quot;legal situation is complicated a bit [...] by Section 9&quot; of the original OGL as that clause states third party designers can &quot;use any authorized version of this License to copy, modify and distribute any Open Game Content originally distributed under any version of this License&quot;. Orland stated that Section 9 coupled with statements made by Wizards of the Coast in the original 2001 FAQ, seem &quot;to suggest that companies could continue using the old license to make products based on the old ruleset that was published under OGL v1.0a (even if upcoming rules changes are covered more directly by OGL v1.1)&quot;.

=== Leaked OGL1.1 draft ===
In November 2022, &quot;Game Rant&quot; commented that &quot;many players are not happy with the implication&quot; of the OGL discontinuation rumor as &quot;tons of creators and companies have made their living on selling third-party &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; homebrew. If Wizards of the Coast does not use the OGL in &quot;One D&amp;D&quot;, many of these creators will be unable to make content for the evergreen system–or will at least have to tiptoe around the law by only using the &quot;5th Edition&quot; SRD to do so&quot;. &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; highlighted that &quot;while not creating a new System Reference Document for One D&amp;D wouldn&#x27;t snuff out third-party material, it would certainly discourage publishing or force publishers to turn to the DMs Guild&quot; which &quot;uses a separate license&quot; and requires a 50% cut of the proceeds.

Following the statement released by Wizards of the Coast in December 2022, Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, wrote: &quot;Wizards noted that this royalty should impact less than 20 &#x27;creators,&#x27; which include major publishing companies like Kobold Press and Ghostfire Gaming&quot;. Chase Carter, for &quot;Dicebreaker&quot;, commented that &quot;this vision of an updated OGL paves a path for Wizards of the Coast to muscle in on ultra-successful crowdfunding projects without crushing existing communities, which the blog post says are &#x27;a critical part of the D&amp;D experience&#x27;. It also said existing virtual tabletop agreements will not be affected by whatever shape the OGL takes, even though the company has announced their own version to launch close to OneD&amp;D&#x27;s release in 2024&quot;.

Lin Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot; on January 5, 2023, wrote that &quot;by ending the original OGL, many licensed publishers will have to completely overhaul their products and distribution in order to comply with the updated rules. Large publishers who focus almost exclusively on products based on the original OGL, including Paizo, Kobold Press, and Green Ronin, will be under pressure to update their business model incredibly fast&quot;. Codega highlighted that &quot;if the original license is in fact no longer viable, every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement, because every commercial creator will be asked to report their products, new and old, to Wizards of the Coast. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand. [...] There are a lot of implications in this extended policy, and the ramifications of this updated OGL could have a chilling effect on new licensed products&quot;. Eric Law, for &quot;Game Rant&quot;, commented that this leak was causing &quot;panic&quot; among third-party publishers. Law stated that &quot;the most concerning section of the legal document adds that Wizards of the Coast has full rights to any content created by the OGL. This would allow &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; to take any homebrew content and publish it in official &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; material without permission or compensation to the original creator&quot;. &quot;ICv2&quot; commented that the leaked OGL has several controversial parts including prohibiting &quot;commercial publication for virtual tabletop platforms&quot; and that while it &quot;grants ownership of the OGL works to their creator&quot; it also &quot;gives WotC the perpetual, irrevocable right to use their works in any way it sees fit without payment&quot;.

Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; in January 2023, stated that &quot;if the OGL viewed by io9 is indeed the final OGL planned for &quot;One D&amp;D&quot;, it would have seismic consequences for the thriving ecosystem that surrounds &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&quot;. Hoffer commented, &quot;although it&#x27;s debatable whether earlier versions of the OGL can actually be revoked or deauthorized [...], the intent of the new OGL is to force publishers to comply with the new OGL, with its easily revocable status and its tiered royalty structure&quot;. Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, commented that &quot;if enforced as written, io9 reports, it could put revenue streams for companies like Pathfinder maker Paizo, Kobold Press, Green Ronin, and others in jeopardy&quot;. Hall also highlighted that Kickstarter negotiated with Wizards of the Coast to lower the royalty amount for creators who use their platform. Hall wrote, &quot;Kickstarter has recently seen increased competition from alternate crowdfunding outlets, including Gamefound and Backerkit. A partnership such as this, formally enshrined into the OGL 1.1, would encourage the largest D&amp;D crowdfunding campaigns to use Kickstarter’s services. [...] Kickstarter confirmed to Polygon that it has discussed a plan with Wizards, but denies its direct involvement in the OGL 1.1&quot;.

In the days following the leak, &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot; and many other industry focused outlets reported on negative reactions from both fans and professional content creators. &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; reported that it had &quot;spoken with over 20 small to mid-sized creators who have said that in-progress projects set to be published under the OGL have been placed on hold due to&quot; the terms in the leak. Many designers had also reported considering switching role-playing game systems entirely. As part of a grassroots campaign protesting against the reported terms of the new OGL, over people have signed the &quot;#OpenDND&quot; internet petition within days of its launch. This included &quot;several well-known D&amp;D community members&quot; such as &quot;&quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Descent into Avernus&quot; writer M.T. Black, prominent D&amp;D streamer Mark Hulmes (who recently ran a streaming show for Wizards of the Coast on D&amp;D&#x27;s streaming channel), and Mike Shea, publisher of &quot;Sly Flourish&quot;&quot;. There was also an online movement to cancel subscriptions to D&amp;D Beyond; &quot;Io9&quot; reported that per their sources at Wizards &quot;the result of these cancellations and their impact on the bottom line of Wizards of the Coast is not negligible&quot; and led to scrambling by upper management &quot;to adjust their messaging around the situation&quot;. &quot;Starburst&quot; commented that &quot;historically when the owners of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; attempt to restrict what people can do with the game, it leads to a boom in other tabletop roleplaying games. This is happening right now&quot;. Both Kobold Press and MCDM Productions announced upcoming new tabletop RPG systems with both stating their respective systems would be open games. Paizo then announced a new Open RPG Creative License (ORC), an open, perpetual, and irrevocable system-agnostic license, as a direct response to the reported changes to the OGL. They stated that the license would not be owned by Paizo or any RPG publisher, to protect against future attempts to modify or rescind it. Additional publishers, such as Kobold Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin, Legendary Games, and Rogue Genius Games, will be part of the ORC development process. Another initiative is from Free League Publishing, which announced two licenses, for its Year Zero game system and another for its upcoming fantasy RPG &quot;Dragonbane&quot;.

On January 13, 2023, Wizards issued a response via D&amp;D Beyond; this response did not contain the updated OGL which will be released at a later date. The statement walked back several changes to the OGL such as removing the royalty structure and the license back language and indicated that other forms of expression, such as VTTs and livestreams, would not be impacted by the updated OGL. &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; commented that &quot;the statement did not address whether the new OGL would attempt to &#x27;de-authorize&#x27; previous versions of the OGL&quot;. &quot;Io9&quot; stated that &quot;there will be no backing down entirely for Wizards of the Coast. They&#x27;ve committed too much time, money, and effort into their IP to allow it to be written off totally under the OGL 1.0(a) and the suits in Hasbro will not allow everyone to make off with their name and numbers. [...] Wizards of the Coast is doing some incredible spin doctoring in order to lay the groundwork to try to salvage the situation that they find themselves in&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; highlighted that &quot;despite Wizards&#x27; apparent course change, response on Twitter to the publisher&#x27;s statement seems just as strongly negative as the blowback to its proposed changes to the OGL&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; also pointed out that much remains unknown including &quot;how a near-final draft of the revised OGL got things so very, very wrong&quot;.

=== Proposed OGL1.2 draft ===
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, for &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; wrote that &quot;pushback from fans, who criticized WotC’s response as far from an apology and a dismissal of their legitimate concerns, led WotC to backpedal further. A second bulletin Wednesday [on January 18] included more details about the path forward, along with a mea culpa from [Kyle] Brink, the executive producer, on behalf of his team&quot;. Evans-Thirlwell highlighted the release of the proposed OGL 1.2 which will have open comment available for two weeks, however, &quot;some say the damage is already done. [...] Whether you view the original OGL as a mystic talisman or smoke-and-mirrors, WotC appears to have committed an irreversible act of self-sabotage in trying to replace it — squandering the prestige accumulated over 20 years in a matter of weeks&quot;. Lin Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot;, wrote that &quot;the commitment to create an irrevocable license under the Creative Commons foundation seems like a good step towards making that happen, and it would not have occurred if &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; creators, influencers, fans, and third party publishers had universally come together to reject the proposed OGL 1.1&quot;. They also highlighted that Wizards continues to have &quot;a firm stance on bigoted and hateful content—something that people praised in the leaked draft&quot;. The proposed OGL1.2 would ban &quot;harmful, discriminatory, or illegal content&quot; which Codega views as a good idea, however, Codega commented &quot;in the wake of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s inclusion and public treatment of the , it remains to be seen if &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is even capable of moderating this kind of content in a way that will be respectful, inclusive, and progressive&quot;.

Both Codega and Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, highlighted that the proposed OGL1.2 would de-authorize OGL1.0a. Hoffer commented that de-authorization is &quot;one major sticking point&quot; as it is &quot;seen as a hard line for many creators and third party publishers&quot;. Hoffer wrote that Brink framed de-authorization as necessary to enforce the &quot;&#x27;No Hateful or Harmful Content&#x27; clause in the new OGL&quot;. Kyle Orland, for &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, stated that &quot;aside from the OGL v1.0a deauthorization, the new draft language scales back many of the most controversial portions of the original leaked update [...]. The new draft language also explicitly notes that the new license is &#x27;perpetual, non-exclusive, and irrevocable,&#x27; with only a few technical sections being eligible for modification in the future&quot;.

=== Creative Commons ===
On January 27, 2023, Wizards of the Coast outlined the feedback received from over 15,000 survey submissions during the open comment for OGL1.2: &quot;88% do not want to publish TTRPG content under OGL 1.2&quot;, &quot;89% are dissatisfied with deauthorizing OGL 1.0a&quot;, &quot;86% are dissatisfied with the draft VTT policy&quot; and &quot;62% are satisfied with including Systems Reference Document (SRD) content in Creative Commons, and the majority of those who were dissatisfied asked for more SRD content in Creative Commons&quot;. As a result, Wizards decided to release the SRD 5.1 under an irrevocable Creative Commons license; it would also no longer attempt to deauthorize the OGL 1.0a. Milton Griepp, for &quot;ICv2&quot;, reported that the events had led to an overwhelmingly negative response, constituting a PR disaster for Wizards of the Coast. Griepp commented that &quot;it remains to be seen whether the steps WotC has taken will be sufficient to unwind the moves other companies have made to disassociate themselves from the OGL, most notably Paizo&quot;.

Christian Hoffer, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, stated that &quot;this is a major change of pace for Wizards of the Coast and seems to be a surprising end to a controversy that had raged for weeks, drawing attention from mainstream news sites. It&#x27;s a huge victory for the wider D&amp;D community&quot;. Charlie Hall, for &quot;Polygon&quot;, also highlighted the major mainstream news coverage this controversy received and the possibility that it may have an impact on the success of upcoming film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;, scheduled for release in March 2023. Lin Codega, for &quot;Io9&quot; in January 2023, wrote that the deauthorization of the OGL 1.0a had been a hard line for many fans so &quot;concessions Wizards and &quot;D&amp;D&quot; make in this announcement are huge&quot; and that &quot;this is a huge victory for the fans&quot;. Codega highlighted Kyle Brink, Executive Producer for D&amp;D, who stated &quot;that putting the entire 400-page SRD into the Creative Commons means that fans don&#x27;t need to &#x27;take [&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;’] word for it.&#x27; That Brink would explicitly acknowledge the lack of trust between fans and publishers and Wizards of the Coast is incredible&quot;.

In May 2024, Lin Codega now of &quot;Rascal&quot; commented that it appeared the Open Game License would not return following Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s announcement that the revised 5th Edition would have an SRD released under the Creative Commons – a move they considered both &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;sad&quot;. Codega opined that &quot;the Open Game License was genuinely a revolutionary contract—established two years before the Creative Commons license was developed—and tabletop games across the board, not just &quot;D&amp;D,&quot; benefited from the free and unrestricted usage granted in the OGL. The OGL should have been the contract to stand the test of time as a testament to the power of open source licensing for intellectual property. But then, as with most good things that are given away in the spirit of joyous creativity and hope for community, capitalism happened. [...] The commitment to putting the updated &quot;D&amp;D&quot; rules into the Creative Commons rather than trying to re-establish the OGL or even establish another GSL-alike is, in my opinion, a good decision&quot;.

<text>Outaouais (, ; also commonly called The Outaouais) is a region of western Quebec, Canada. It includes the city of Gatineau, the municipality of Val-des-Monts, the municipality of Cantley and the Papineau region. Geographically, it is located on the north side of the Ottawa River opposite Canada&#x27;s capital, Ottawa. It has a land area of and its population was 405,158 inhabitants as of 2021.

From 2017 to 2021, the Outaouais has a lower per capita disposable income than the rest of Quebec. It was $32,364 in 2021, compared to $34,180 in Quebec overall. In 2021, the unfavourable margin remained stable at 5.3%.

== History ==
The name of the region comes from the French name for the Ottawa River, which in turn comes from the French name for the Indigenous Odawa that lived near the region. Prior to European arrival in the region, the areas along the Ottawa River were commonly used by various tribes to trade and gather.

The oldest European settlement in the region is Hull (now a neighbourhood of Gatineau) which was founded in 1800 by Philemon Wright as Wright&#x27;s Town. The settlement quickly became involved in the lumber trade, which continued along the Ottawa River until the late 20th century. None of the original town buildings remain today, as they were destroyed in the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire. Hull remained a city until 2002, when it was merged with several neighboring cities to form the current city of Gatineau.

== Demography ==

For the next few years, the Outaouais is predicted to enjoy continuous demographic increase.

From 2021 to 2026, the region&#x27;s population is predicted to expand faster than the rest of Quebec (+4.8% against +4.2%).

Longer-term projections show that the region&#x27;s population will expand faster than Quebec&#x27;s for each following five-year period.
Year after year, the Outaouais&#x27; net migration (inflows minus outflows) with other areas is positive.

Yet, for the first time in 20 years, the area had negative net migration in 2020-2021.

Historically, the Outaouais area averaged positive inter-regional migration balances, gaining 541 residents each year for a net rate of +0.14% from 2016 to 2021.

Interregional migration rate

* 2016-2017 : 0,16 %
* 2017-2018 : 0,25 %
* 2018-2019 : 0,19 %
* 2019-2020 : 0,12 %
* 2020-2021 : -0,01 %

== Economy ==
In 2021, the situation on the Outaouais labour market has improved. Employment increased by 9,500 positions.

The participation rate increased to 63.7%. The negative gap between the region&#x27;s participation rate and that of Quebec narrowed from 1.0 to 0.4 percentage points.

The employment rate increased to 60.2% in the region. The region now has an employment rate comparable to that of Quebec (60.1%).

Since 1999, the Outaouais has generally had a lower unemployment rate than Quebec as a whole. In 2021, this trend continued; the unemployment rate decreased by 2.5 percentage points to 5.6%, compared to 6.1% for Quebec as a whole. This decrease is explained by the improvement in employment.

The Outaouais&#x27; industrial structure matches its mission, which is concentrated on government services. As a result, the economy is heavily geared towards the service sector.

In 2021, the primary sector in the Outaouais accounted for a lower proportion of jobs than the primary sector in Quebec as a whole (1.4% vs. 2.2%).

Also, the manufacturing sector employed fewer people than the rest of Quebec (4.0% vs. 11.3%).

Nonetheless, the construction sector employed more people in the Outaouais (8.4%) than in Quebec overall (6.7%).

The region&#x27;s economy is dominated by tertiarization. The tertiary sector&#x27;s percentage of total employment (86.1%) is substantially larger than that reported in Quebec overall (79.7%). This finding is explained by the significance of public services.

In 2021, the Outaouais would account for 4.7% of Quebec&#x27;s population and 4.6% of its jobs.

<doc id="869659" wikidata="Q1591993" url="?curid=869659" title="Hayne van Ghizeghem">
<text>Hayne van Ghizeghem ( 1445 – from 1472 to 1497) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance Burgundian School.

While many of his works have survived, little is known about his life. He was probably born in Gijzegem (near Aalst, in modern Belgium).
His musical talent must have been noticed early by Charles, Count of Charolais (later to become Charles the Bold) because there is a record of his being personally assigned to a teacher by him; in 1467 he is shown in the Burgundian employment records as being a singer. In addition, he was named along with Adrien Basin and Antoine Busnois as &quot;chantre et valet de chambre&quot; to Charles, indicating the special regard in which he was held.

In addition to serving as a singer and composer, he evidently served as a soldier as well, for there is a record of purchase of military equipment for him, prior to the campaign against Liège by Charles. Charles took his musicians along with him on his campaigns, because he loved music as much as war, and insisted on entertainment; however Hayne was the only one of his famous musicians known to be also outfitted as a soldier. He is known to have been at the Siege of Beauvais in 1472, where Charles was decisively repulsed by the French, and Hayne was long presumed by scholars to have been killed in that battle. However, recent research into his surviving compositions indicates that some may have been produced after 1472, especially because they seem to show stylistic development beyond the ones that can be definitively dated to 1472 or before. Current scholarship suggests instead he may have survived the siege, and gone to work at the court of France. That such a distinguished singer and composer worked for France&#x27;s bitter rival would have been an offense easy to forgive, for Burgundian musicians of the time were highly prized.

Hayne is principally known as a composer of chansons, and most of these are rondeaux. Two in particular—&quot;Allez regrets&quot;, and &quot;De tous biens plaine&quot;—were so famous in late 15th-century Europe that they appeared in 25 separate sources, many dating from before the invention of printing, and they were used as source material for many later compositions by other composers. Almost all of his works are for three voices; they are simple and clear in texture, in the typical manner of the Burgundian school; and the melodic voice is the highest.

Eleven pieces can be definitively attributed to Hayne, though numerous similar works classified as &quot;anonymous&quot; may actually be compositions of his. The entire collection has been edited and published in &quot;Corpus mensurabilis musicae&quot;, vol. lxxiv (1977), by B. Hudson.

<text>Kommunistiska Partiet i Sverige () was a pro-Albanian communist party in Sweden. KPS was formed in 1982. It was dissolved in 1993.

In 1978, a pro-Albanian group had broken away from the Communist Party of Sweden. This group formed &quot;Norrköpings Kommunistiska Förening&quot; (Communist Association of Norrköping). In 1979 NKF merged with Stockholms Kommunistiska Enhetsgrupp to form &quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Förbund - ml&quot; (Communist League of Sweden - ml). The magazine &quot;Kommunisten&quot; started publication in 1979. SKF-ml founded &quot;Organisationen för skapandet av Kommunistiska Partiet i Sverige&quot; (Organization for the creation of the Communist Party in Sweden) in October 1981. This organization later gave birth to KPS.

The leader of KPS was Anders Persson.

The youth league of KPS was called &quot;Ungkommunisterna i Sverige&quot; (Young Communists in Sweden). KPS maintained a publishing house called &quot;Kommunistiska Arbetarförlaget&quot; (Communist Workers Publishing House).

A series of expulsions 1983-1984 led to the refoundation of the NKF.

KPS considered parties like VPK, APK and KPML(r) as revisionist. The latter was described as the &quot;left-wing alibi of Moscow in Sweden&quot;. KPS urged communists to struggle against both the United States and the USSR.

Gradually KPS started to distance itself from the Albanian line, somewhat similar to the development of the Nicaraguan MAP-ML.

In 1989, KPS suffered a major split, with a large section leaving the party. The splinters started a magazine called &quot;Vänstertidningen&quot; (Left Magazine), which was supposed to be a broader non-party marxist, socialist and ecologist forum. It disappeared rapidly.

The publication &quot;Kommunisten&quot; was later fused with &quot;Kommunistiska Arbetartidningen&quot; of &quot;Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti (Marxist-Leninisterna)&quot; to form &quot;Nya Arbetartidningen&quot;.

<text>Charles Edward Finley (born November 26, 1962) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He pitched from 1986 to 2002 for three teams in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the California Angels. After a 14-year tenure with the Angels, he played for the Cleveland Indians for two-and-a-half seasons, then was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals and played there for a half-season. Listed at and , he threw and batted left-handed. During a 17-year major-league career, Finley compiled 200 wins, 2,610 strikeouts, and a 3.85 earned run average. He holds multiple Angels team records for a career, including games started (379), wins (165), losses (140), and innings pitched (2,675).

==Baseball career==
Finley was born in Monroe, Louisiana, and pitched for West Monroe High School. After first playing college baseball for Louisiana Tech University, he transferred to Northeast Louisiana University. His ability to pitch for more than two or three innings was initially limited by mechanical issues, as his delivery at this time was &quot;crude&quot; and inconsistent. He was selected by the California Angels in the 15th round of the 1984 MLB draft, held in June, but he did not sign. The Angels chose Finley again with the fourth overall pick of the secondary phase of the draft, held in January 1985. After pitching for Northeast Louisiana during the spring, he signed with the Angels by late May.

Finley began his professional baseball career in 1985 with the minor league Salem Angels, a Class A Short Season team in the Northwest League. In 18 appearances, all in relief, he recorded a 4.66 earned run average (ERA) and a 3–1 win–loss record while earning five saves. In 1986, he made 10 relief appearances for the Quad Cities Angels of the Class A Midwest League, allowing only four hits and no earned runs in 12 innings pitched while striking out 16 batters and notching six saves. He was called up to the major-league Angels in late May.

===California Angels / Anaheim Angels===
Finley made his MLB debut with the Angels on May 29, 1986, during a 7–4 loss to the Detroit Tigers. In relief of starting pitcher Don Sutton, Finley allowed two runs on two hits in one inning pitched. He also recorded his first major-league strikeout, coming against Pat Sheridan. Finley made a total of 25 appearances, all in relief, with the 1986 Angels, pitching to a 3.30 ERA and a 3–1 record while striking out 37 batters in innings. In his only postseason appearances with the Angels, Finley played in three games of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox, allowing one hit in two innings pitched.

Finley pitched to a 2–7 record with a 4.67 ERA in 1987, appearing in 35 games including three starts at the end of the season. The 32 relief appearances he made were the last of his major league career, as he was subsequently used exclusively as a starter. During 1988, Finley made 31 starts, accruing a 9–15 record with 4.17 ERA. His first MLB win as a starting pitcher came on April 13, a 5–2 win over the Chicago White Sox, and later that month he recorded his first complete game, a 6–1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on April 30.

Finley was selected to the MLB All-Star Game in both 1989 and 1990. In the former season, he was 16–9 in 29 starts with a 2.57 ERA, while in the latter season he was 18–9 with a career-low 2.40 ERA in 32 starts. He received one vote in 1990 Cy Young Award balloting for the American League (AL), with the award going to Bob Welch of the Oakland Athletics. Finley again was 18–9 in 1991, albeit with a higher ERA of 3.80. His ERA further increased to 3.96 in 1992, and his record fell to 7–12.

Finley led the major leagues in complete games in 1993, with 13, en route to a 16–14 record with a 3.15 ERA in a career-high innings pitched. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, he led the AL in starts (25) and innings pitched () while going 10–10 with a 4.32 ERA. Finley was selected to his third and fourth MLB All-Star Games in 1995 and 1996, winning 15 games each season, against 12 losses in 1995 with a 4.21 ERA, and 16 losses in 1996 with a 4.16 ERA. Finley became a free agent for the first time following the 1995 season, and was re-signed by the Angels.

In 1997, the team changed its name from California Angels to Anaheim Angels. During spring training, Finley was struck by a bat and sustained a broken orbital bone under his right eye. He made two rehabilitation starts, with the Class A-Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm of the California League. For the major-league season, he registered a 4.23 ERA and 13–6 record with the Angels. In 1998, he was 11–9 with a 3.39 ERA. During the 1999 season, Finley made 33 starts, compiling a 12–11 record with a 4.43 ERA. Finley also became the first pitcher in major league history to record four strikeouts in a single inning more than once, accomplishing the feat for the Angels on May 12 and August 15; he later accomplished it for a third time on April 16, 2000. He remains the only player to do it 3 times in his career.

After the 1999 season, Finley again became a free agent, and did not return to the Angels. In his 14 seasons with the team, he accrued an overall record of 165–140 with 3.72 ERA in 2,675 innings pitched; he won 15 or more games six times and pitched over 200 innings eight times.

===Cleveland Indians===
Finley signed with the Cleveland Indians in mid-December 1999. In 2000, he went 16–11 with a 4.17 ERA and was named an MLB All-Star for the fifth and final time of his career. In January 2001, Finley underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, and went on the disabled list twice during the season for neck and shoulder spasms. He made two rehabilitation appearances with the Akron Aeros of the Double-A Eastern League, and in 22 appearances with Cleveland posted an 8–7 record with a 5.54 ERA. In the 2001 American League Division Series, Finley started two games against the Seattle Mariners, losing both and pitching to a 7.27 ERA. In 2002, he was 4–11 in 18 starts for Cleveland with a 4.44 ERA before being traded.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Finley was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals on July 19, 2002, for minor-league outfielder Luis Garcia and a player to be named later. Outfielder Coco Crisp was sent to Cleveland in early August to complete the deal, making his MLB debut later that month. Finley went 7–4 with a 3.80 ERA in 14 starts through the remainder of the season. In the 2002 postseason, Finley started one game of the 2002 National League Division Series, getting a no decision as the Cardinals swept the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the 2002 National League Championship Series, he won his only start, a 5–4 win over the San Francisco Giants in Game 3, as the Cardinals were eliminated in five games.

In November 2002, Finley filed for free agency. He remained unsigned into the 2003 season, and did not play again professionally. Overall, during his 17 seasons in MLB, Finley compiled a record of 200–173 with a 3.85 ERA and 1.376 WHIP. Defensively, he had a .907 fielding percentage, while offensively he had three hits in 53 at bats for an .057 batting average. He was only ejected from two MLB games, one each in 1990 and 1991.

Finely became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame on the 2008 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, but only received one vote and fell off the ballot.

==Personal life==
, Finley lives in Newport Beach, California.

===Marriage===
Finley was married to actress Tawny Kitaen from 1997 to 2002. They had two daughters. Finley and Kitaen were featured together in the 1999 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue.

On April 4, 2002, Finley filed for divorce three days after Kitaen was charged with committing domestic violence against him, twisting his ear and having beaten him repeatedly with a stiletto heel in the arm, leg and foot while he was driving a car in Orange County, California, two weeks earlier. In the divorce filings, he stated, &quot;I am fearful that (Kitaen)... will harm herself or will harm others, including me or including my children.&quot; He received a temporary restraining order preventing her from seeing him and he received temporary custody of the children. During hearings on the domestic violence charge of spousal abuse, Kitaen initially pleaded not guilty but admitted that she was addicted to prescription medications which she had taken for two years for migraines, and voluntarily entered both substance abuse treatment and anger management classes for 52 weeks to get the charges dropped. Tawny Finley, in a declaration to the Orange County Superior Court, claimed Finley used steroids, among other drugs. She also claimed he bragged about being able to circumvent MLB&#x27;s testing policy. When told of his wife&#x27;s accusations, which also included heavy marijuana use and alcohol abuse, Finley replied: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe she left out the cross-dressing.&quot;

So prevalent was his personal life troubles that in April 16, 2002, road game against the Chicago White Sox, the Comiskey Park musical director took a subtle dig at Finley&#x27;s messy divorce, and played &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; by the band Whitesnake, referencing Kitaen&#x27;s appearance in that band&#x27;s videos and her previous marriage to the band&#x27;s lead singer, David Coverdale. Lasting only innings, Finley gave up nine runs (eight earned) including two home runs. The musical director was later fired, and the White Sox apologized.

Finley&#x27;s third daughter Briena was born in 2007 from a relationship at the time.

===In popular culture===
In the show &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, the character Sam Axe, played by Bruce Campbell, frequently uses the alias Chuck Finley (or Charles Finley for more sophisticated circumstances), which is said to be chosen by Sam because he successfully bet on Chuck Finley many times. Reportedly, Campbell&#x27;s father was once friends with a coworker also named Chuck Finley.

===Library Scandal===
In 2016, staff at the East Lake County Library in Sorrento, Florida, created a fictitious patron named “Chuck Finley” to manipulate the library’s circulation records. The name, borrowed from retired Major League Baseball pitcher Chuck Finley, was used to check out over 2,600 books within a nine-month period. The scheme was designed to prevent the library’s automated weeding system from discarding titles that had not been borrowed for an extended time. Library officials claimed this practice helped retain popular books that would otherwise have been removed and later repurchased. 

Following an anonymous tip, an investigation by the Lake County Clerk of Courts’ inspector general’s office uncovered multiple fabricated accounts, leading to the suspension of staff involved and a system-wide audit of the county’s libraries. While the librarians did not personally benefit from the scheme, their actions as an attempt to “teach the system” how to better reflect reader interest rather than rely solely on circulation metrics. The former major league pitcher was not involved in the scandal.

===Honors===
Finley became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame as of 2008; he received one vote, and was dropped from future consideration for falling below the 5% threshold required to remain on the ballot.

Finley was inducted to the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2006. In November 2007, the Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks baseball program (known as Northeast Louisiana when Finley played there) retired Finley&#x27;s no. 31 jersey; he was previously inducted to the university&#x27;s hall of fame in 1996. Finley was inducted to the Angels Hall of Fame on August 27, 2009.

<doc id="869670" wikidata="Q478297" url="?curid=869670" title="Curtiss B-2 Condor">
<text>The Curtiss B-2 Condor was a 1920s United States bomber aircraft. It was a descendant of the Martin NBS-1, which was built by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company for the Glenn L. Martin Company. There were a few differences, such as stronger materials and different engines, but they were relatively minor.

==Development==
The B-2 was a large fabric-covered biplane aircraft. Its two engines sat in nacelles between the wings, flanking the fuselage. It had a twin set of rudders with twin horizontal stabilizers, a configuration which was becoming obsolete by that time. At the rear of each nacelle was a gunner position. In previous planes, the back-facing gunners had been in the fuselage, but their view there was obstructed. A similar arrangement (using nacelle-mounted gun platforms) was adopted in the competing Keystone XB-1 aircraft.

The XB-2 competed for a United States Army Air Corps production contract with the similar Keystone XB-1, Sikorsky S-37, and Fokker XLB-2. The other three were immediately ruled out, but the Army board appointed to make the contracts was strongly supportive of the smaller Keystone XLB-6, which cost a third as much as the B-2. Furthermore, the B-2 was large for the time and difficult to fit into existing hangars. However, the superior performance of the XB-2 soon wrought a policy change, and in 1928 a production run of 12 was ordered.

One modified B-2, dubbed the B-2A, featured dual controls for both the pilot and the copilot. Previously, the control wheel and the pitch controls could only be handled by one person at a time. This &quot;dual control&quot; setup became standard on all bombers by the 1930s. There was no production line for the B-2A. The B-2 design was also used as a transport.

The B-2 was quickly made obsolete by technological advances of the 1930s, and served only briefly with the Army Air Corps, being removed from service by 1934. Following production of the B-2, Curtiss Aircraft left the bomber business, and concentrated on the &quot;Hawk&quot; series of pursuit aircraft in the 1930s.

<doc id="869673" wikidata="Q918041" url="?curid=869673" title="I Should Coco">
<text>I Should Coco is the debut studio album by English alternative rock band Supergrass, released on 15 May 1995 by Parlophone. The title of the album is Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;I should think so&quot;.

Supergrass were formed in 1993 by Gaz Coombes, Mick Quinn and Danny Goffey, and they released their debut single, &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot;, in October 1994 on the small independent local label Backbeat Records. Success of the single brought a major label record deal. &quot;I Should Coco&quot; was recorded in Cornwall and produced by Sam Williams, who had been impressed by the band while scouting in Oxford. At the height of the Britpop era, the album became the band&#x27;s most successful release when it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and subsequently gained platinum status, selling over a million copies worldwide and 500,000 in the UK. The most successful single released from &quot;I Should Coco&quot; is &quot;Alright&quot;, which peaked at number two on the UK singles chart, and gained platinum status.

==Recording and production==

Supergrass formed in 1993 after the break-up of The Jennifers and consists of Gaz Coombes (lead vocals), Danny Goffey (drums), Mick Quinn (bass), and Rob Coombes (keyboards). Gaz Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn had been playing gigs around Oxford when they were spotted by producer Sam Williams, who said he wanted to work with them. Between the months of May and August, the band recorded a six track demo at Sawmills Studio and, having signed a deal with Backbeat Records, a limited number of copies of &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot; and &quot;Mansize Rooster&quot; were released. The demo had also quickly reached EMI, however, and that led to the group being signed by the Parlophone label, which would re-release the two songs. Quinn said &quot;it took about three and a half months total recording time and cost less to make than the video for Alright.&quot;

A recording made at Carfax Tower in Oxford provided the bell chimes heard at the end of &quot;Strange Ones&quot;. These chimes were only heard on the &quot;I Should Coco&quot; version, not on &quot;Supergrass Is 10&quot;, because on the &quot;I Should Coco&quot; album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, &quot;Sitting Up Straight&quot;, which was not included in &quot;Supergrass Is 10&quot;. &quot;Strange Ones&quot; was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the &quot;throwaway song&quot; on the B-side to &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot;. Another song on the album with the same theme, &quot;I&#x27;d Like To Know&quot;, was inspired by listening to &quot;Strange Ones&quot; played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, &quot;One of the highlights of this album was recording &#x27;Sofa (Of My Lethargy)&#x27;. ... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [Williams] on bass, a friend of his on Hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take. ... We made &quot;I Should Coco&quot; so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!&quot; In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered &quot;writing that song [&#x27;Time&#x27;] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track&quot;.

==Cover art and title==
The album title is Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;I should think so&quot;. The front cover of the album is a painting based on three separate photos of Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn. The portraits of Coombes and Goffey were taken by Quinn in the summer of 1994 when he was experimenting with a macro lens. The photo of Quinn was taken that same year by a friend, while they were on tour in Wolverhampton. The painting was then created by the Moody Painters who were based on Oxford&#x27;s Cowley Road. The white band at the top was inspired by an old Donovan record that Quinn owned and is an homage to old 1950s and 1960s records, with the stereo-mono signs. The photo on the back of the album was taken at a club in London about five minutes after they came off stage. The photo consists of two separate shots grafted together because Quinn was &quot;pulling a disgusting face in the original&quot;. All of these elements were then put together by Nick Bax of The Designers Republic to create the finished sleeve. The Bonus 7&quot; featured a more kaleidoscope-style front cover, based on an original 1960&#x27;s Parlophone paper &#x27;company sleeve&#x27;.

==Music==


The group&#x27;s primary musical influences came from bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop-punk&#x27;s characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes to produce a sound uniquely their own; &quot;we were just the three of us in my bedroom or someone&#x27;s house, just making ... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that&#x27;s why the first album sounded so &#x27;punky&#x27;, I think ... it&#x27;s just &#x27;cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that.&quot; &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; by Graham Nash was another possible influence on &quot;I Should Coco&quot;. Gaz Coombes told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, &quot;We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big.&quot;

The musical styles and their particular inspirations for the songs on this album were extremely diverse. For example, there is the cheerful, fast, keyboard-augmented &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Know&quot;, the guitar-driven punk narrative &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot;, the mainly piano-based rhythm of the teen anthem &quot;Alright&quot;, and the country music-influenced acoustic guitar in &quot;Time to Go&quot;. Even in the varied genre of Britpop, &quot;I Should Coco&quot; was seen as eclectic. Overall, the album has been described as Britpop, influenced in equal parts by Buzzcocks and The Kinks, with strong hints of Supertramp in &quot;She&#x27;s So Loose&quot;, &quot;Lose It&quot; and the intro of &quot;Strange Ones&quot;.

In a 1995 interview with &quot;Metro&quot;, Mick Quinn said, &quot;We listen to a lot of different kinds of music. We&#x27;re &quot;not&quot; a &#x27;60s-revival band! We like things from the &#x27;70s and beyond as well; everything from Sly and the Family Stone and Motown to Frank Black and Tricky.&quot;

&quot;Strange Ones&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Know&quot; are both songs about the strange people on Cowley Road, Oxford. Mick Quinn tried to describe the concept: &quot;There&#x27;s a few people who are just really out there. There&#x27;s a lot of people around Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I&#x27;m not really sure about them. I&#x27;m not really sure that they&#x27;re individuals: they&#x27;re part of a much larger thing.&quot; Danny Goffey added, &quot;They&#x27;re the sort of people who don&#x27;t fit in anywhere, who don&#x27;t link up with everyday life at all.&quot;

&quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot; was based on a real-life event: Gaz Coombes&#x27;s arrest and caution for possession of cannabis aged fifteen. In a 2004 interview, Coombes said &quot;It wasn&#x27;t trying to be a real statement, but at the time we knew that it was a big deal. Kids all around England were getting nicked for having a bit of hash on them. In Oxford that kind of thing happened quite a lot. It&#x27;s all true so it was easy to write. It was a funny experience – not too funny at the time &#x27;cause I was only 15 and shitting myself. The song has that disturbing energy. It&#x27;s comparable to your heart racing. The adrenaline rush you get when your mum walks into the police station is similar to the energy of the song.&quot;

&quot;Mansize Rooster&quot; is said to be about a young boy with a large penis, although this is not obvious from the lyrics. Gaz Coombes once stated in an interview that &quot;the most embarrassing moment in pop is on our album where it goes: &#x27;Oi Mum! Got any mandies?&#x27;&quot; This was one of the many exclamations made between tracks on &quot;I Should Coco&quot; in the sped-up voices of the band members. It was said before the song &quot;We&#x27;re Not Supposed To&quot; began.

==Release and reception==

&quot;I Should Coco&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, stayed there for three weeks, and still remains the only number-one album Supergrass has ever achieved. It sold 500,000 copies domestically, earning Platinum status in the UK, and has sold over a million copies worldwide. &quot;NME&quot; writer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating. He wrote, &quot;They play with the skill and assurance of a band who&#x27;ve been going for decades yet they still burn off the buzz of being new to the game.&quot; He added, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing contrived about &quot;I Should Coco&quot;, nothing added for effect.&quot;

Culturally, the album&#x27;s glorification of teenage freedom made a very big impact on the overall Britpop music scene. The whole genre was seen as the voice of youth, but Supergrass, still teens themselves when the album was made, addressed the subject with more insight than most. The most well-known song from the album, &quot;Alright&quot;, is still played regularly in Britain and Ireland, and held up as a musical example of teenage rebellion. Though it is one of their most popular songs, the band rarely play &quot;Alright&quot; in their live sets any more. In a 1999 interview, Gaz Coombes joked, &quot;We don&#x27;t play &#x27;Alright&#x27; anymore. We should play it in a minor key, and in the past tense.&quot; Around the time of its release Coombes said that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t written as an anthem. It isn&#x27;t supposed to be a rally cry for our generation. The stuff about ″&quot;We are young/We run green ...&quot;″ isn&#x27;t about being 19 but really 13 or 14 and just discovering girls and drinking. It&#x27;s meant to be light-hearted and a bit of a laugh, not at all a rebellious call to arms.&quot; Danny Goffey noted, &quot;It certainly wasn&#x27;t written in a very summery vibe. It was written in a cottage where the heating had packed up and we were trying to build fires to keep warm.&quot;

All five singles released in the UK from &quot;I Should Coco&quot; were well received by the British public. The first single from the album, &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot;, peaked at number 43 on the UK singles chart. The second single from the album, &quot;Mansize Rooster&quot;, was played as Supergrass&#x27;s first live television performance on &quot;The Word&quot; in 1995, and reached number 20 on the UK singles chart. &quot;Lose It&quot;, officially the third single taken from the album, was a vinyl-only US release from Sub Pop. &quot;Lenny&quot; was the fourth single from &quot;I Should Coco&quot;; it reached number 10 on the UK singles chart, and remained there for four weeks. The final release from the album, &quot;Alright/Time&quot;, proved to be their breakthrough single, largely due to the popularity of the song &quot;Alright&quot;. Supergrass&#x27;s highest ranked single to date, along with &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot; reached number 2 on the UK singles chart, remained in the top three for a month, and still receives airplay in the UK. &quot;I Should Coco&quot; was nominated for Best Album at the 1995 Mercury Prize awards, and the single &quot;Alright&quot; from the album won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song.

In a 2005 interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, Coombes said, &quot;It&#x27;s insane that people think we would ever sound like that again ... We&#x27;re proud of &#x27;Alright&#x27; and how well it did, but we never wanted to find a formula and stick to it. Our aim was always to progress and keep the music interesting, for us and for the fans. So the people who see us in the street and still shout &#x27;We are young&#x27; may not like the new album, but fans who have grown up with us and know to expect change probably will.&quot;

&quot;I Should Coco&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In a 2007 retrospective review of the album, Al Fox of BBC Music hailed it as &quot;an iconic 90s masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="869676" wikidata="Q471351" url="?curid=869676" title="Ernest Shonekan">
<text>Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan (9 May 1936 – 11 January 2022) was a Nigerian lawyer and statesman who served as the interim head of state of Nigeria from 26 August 1993 to 17 November 1993. He was installed the Abese of Egbaland in 1981.

Prior to his political career, Shonekan was the chairman and chief executive of the United African Company of Nigeria (successor of The Niger Company), a vast Nigerian conglomerate which at the time was the largest African-controlled company in Sub-Saharan Africa.

==Early life==
Shonekan was born in Lagos on 9 May 1936. The son of an Abeokuta-born civil servant, he was one of six children born into the family.

Shonekan was educated at CMS Grammar School and Igbobi College. He received a law degree from the University of London, and was called to the bar. He later attended Harvard Business School.

==Early business career==

Shonekan joined the United Africa Company of Nigeria in 1964, at the time a subsidiary of the United Africa Company which played a prominent role in British colonisation. He rose through the ranks in the company and was promoted to assistant legal adviser. He later became a deputy adviser and joined the board of directors at the age of 40. He was made chairman and managing director in 1980, and went on to cultivate a wide array of international business and political connections.

==Crisis of the Third Republic==

On 2 January 1993, Shonekan assumed office simultaneously as head of transitional council and head of government under Ibrahim Babangida. At the time, the transitional council was designed to be the final phase leading to a scheduled hand over to an elected democratic leader of the Third Nigerian Republic.

Shonekan learned of the dire condition of government finances, which he was unable to correct. The government was hard pressed on international debt obligations and had to hold constant talks for debt rescheduling.

In August 1993, Babangida resigned from office, following the annulment of the 12 June elections. He signed a decree establishing the Interim National Government led by Shonekan who was subsequently sworn in as head of state.

==Interim government==

Shonekan was unable to control the political crisis which ensued following the election annulment. During his few months in power, he tried to schedule another presidential election and a return to democratic rule, while his government was hampered by a national workers&#x27; strike. Opposition leader Moshood Abiola, viewed Shonekan&#x27;s interim government as illegitimate. Shonekan released political prisoners detained by Babangida. Shonekan&#x27;s administration introduced a bill to repeal three major draconian decrees of the military government. Babangida made the interim government weak by placing it under the control of the military.

Shonekan had lobbied for debt cancellation but, after the election annulment, most of the Western powers had imposed economic sanctions on Nigeria. Inflation was uncontrollable and most non-oil foreign investment disappeared. The government also initiated an audit of the accounts of NNPC, the oil giant, an organisation that had many operational inefficiencies. Shonekan served as an executive of Royal Dutch Shell while acting as the interim president of Nigeria.

Shonekan tried to set a timetable for troop withdrawal from ECOMOG&#x27;s peacekeeping mission in Liberia. General Sani Abacha, was the minister of defence and chief of defence staff who had full control over the military.

Shonekan&#x27;s government had to deal with the 1993 Nigerian Airways hijack.

==Out of office==
On 18 November 1993, three months into his administration, Shonekan was overthrown in a palace coup by General Sani Abacha.

In 1993, along with other prominent Nigerians and expatriates, he founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, an advocacy and think-tank group for private sector-led development of the Nigerian economy.

==Personal life and death==
Shonekan was married to Margaret Shonekan. He died on 11 January 2022, at the age of 85 at Evercare Hospital in Lagos. At the time of his death, he was the third oldest surviving Nigerian head of state by age after Elizabeth II and Yakubu Gowon.

<doc id="869677" wikidata="Q271030" url="?curid=869677" title="Buru">
<text>Buru (formerly spelled Boeroe, Boro, or Bouru) is the third largest island within the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It lies between the Banda Sea to the south and Seram Sea to the north, west of Ambon and Seram islands. The island belongs to Maluku province and includes the Buru and South Buru regencies. Their administrative centers, Namlea and Namrole, respectively, have ports and are the largest towns of the island, served by Namlea Airport and Namrole Airport respectively.

About a third of the population is indigenous, mostly Buru, but also Lisela, Ambelau and Kayeli people. The rest of population are immigrants from Java and nearby Maluku Islands. Religious affiliation is evenly split between Christianity and Sunni Islam, with some remnants of traditional beliefs. While local languages and dialects are spoken within individual communities, the national Indonesian language is used among the communities and by the administration. Most of the island is covered with forests rich in tropical flora and fauna. From the present 179 bird and 25 mammal species, about 14 are found either on Buru only or also on a few nearby islands, the most notable being the wild pig Buru babirusa. There is little industry on the island, and most population is engaged in growing rice, maize, sweet potato, beans, coconuts, cocoa, coffee, clove and nutmeg. Other significant activities are animal farming and fishing.

The island was first mentioned around 1365. Between 1658 and 1942, it was colonised by the Dutch East India Company and then by the Crown of the Netherlands. The Dutch administration relocated many local villages to the newly built island capital at Kayeli Bay for working at clove plantations. It also promoted the hierarchy among the indigenous people with selected loyal rajas placed above the heads of the local clans. The island was occupied by the Japanese forces between 1942 and 1945 and in 1950 became part of independent Indonesia. During former president Suharto&#x27;s New Order administration in the 1960s–1970s, Buru was the site of a prison used to hold thousands of political prisoners. While held at Buru, writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer wrote most of his novels, including &quot;Buru Quartet&quot;.

==Geography and geology==

Buru island lies between two seas of the Pacific Ocean – Seram Sea () on the north and Banda Sea () to the south and west. To the east, it is separated by the Manipa Strait () from Seram Island (). With an area of , Buru is the third largest among the Maluku Islands () after Halmahera and Seram.

Buru is shaped like an oval, elongated from west to east. The maximum length is about from east to west and from north to south. The coastline is smooth, with the only major indentation being Kayeli Bay located on the eastern coast. The bay also has a smooth, oval shape. It extends into the island to 8–12 km and has a maximum width of 17 km; the width decreases to 9 km at the mouth; the coastal length of the bay is about 50 km. At the northern part of the mouth stands Namlea, the largest town of the island.

The highest point on the island () is the peak of Mount Kapalatmada (also called Kepala Madan, Kepalat Mada or Ghegan). Off the coast of Buru there are several smaller islands; those permanently inhabited are Ambalau (the largest, about 10 km in diameter, located about 20 km south-east of Buru) and Tengah (). The largest uninhabited islands are Fogi (), Oki () and Tomahu ().

The island is mostly mountainous, especially in the central and western parts. Of the 9,505 km2 of the island area, 1,789 km2 lie 900 m above mean sea level, 872 km2 above 1,200 m and 382 km2 above 1,500 m. Flat areas are located in narrow strips near the coast and along the banks of river Apo. There they form a valley of the same name. Much of the island is covered with tropical rain forest.

The Apo River is the longest river of Buru. It flows nearly straight to the north-east and empties into Kayeli Bay; however, its bed is very winding for hundreds of meters, with loops all along its length. Two other permanent rivers are Geren and Nibe; the rest are intermittent rivers with discontinuous flow. The river discharge varies significantly through the year, reaching a maximum in the rainy season. Indonesian sources often include &quot;wae&quot; (meaning river) before the river names; thus Apo is often referred to as Waeapo or Wae Apo, or Apu in some local dialects. In the center of the island, at an altitude of , lies freshwater Lake Rana (). This is the only significant lake on Buru; it has a nearly rectangular shape with the length of about 4.3 km, width of about 2.7 km and an area of 

The crust consists of several types of deposits. It is dominated by Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, probably originating from the Australian continent; Also present are younger volcanic rocks and more recent alluvial deposits. Sedimentary deposits in the form of silt, peat, sand and mud are mostly found in the river valleys. Metamorphic rocks of slate, schist and arkose dominate the northern part of the island. Very few mineral deposits of Buru have industrial value, and only limestone is mined commercially. However, significant reserves of oil and gas were discovered in the shelf in 2009. There are numerous coral reefs around the island. The soil mostly consists of yellow-red Podsol, Organosol, Grumosol and various mixtures.

== Climate ==
The climate is equatorial monsoonal, wet, and in general typical for the Maluku Islands. The rainy season extends from October to April with the highest rainfall in December–February. Despite the relatively small size of the island, its mountainous terrain results in several climatic zones. Apart from temperature reduction with altitude, the temperature variations across these zones are negligible, with the annual average of about 26 °C, However the annual precipitation differs and amounts to 1,400–1,800 mm in the north, 1,800–2,000 mm in the center, 2,000–2,500 mm in the south and 3,000–4,000 mm in the mountains, at elevation above 500 m.

== Flora and fauna ==

As Buru is located at the boundary between the biogeographic zones of Australia and Asia, its flora and fauna are unique and are the subject of national and international scientific research. Of 25 species of mammals found on the island, at least four are endemic to Buru and closest to it islands. The local species of the wild pig named Buru babirusa (&quot;Babyrousa babyrussa&quot;) is distinguished from the other &quot;Babyrousa&quot; species by having relatively long and thick body-hair. It also has very low fat content in their meat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy among the local population, which favours it to other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavour. Also endemic to Buru are three types of bats: Moluccan flying fox (&quot;Pteropus chrysoproctus&quot;), Ceram fruit bat &quot;Pteropus ocularis&quot; and lesser tube-nosed bat (&quot;Nyctimene minutus&quot;).

Of the 178 recorded species of birds, 10 are endemic to Buru and nearby islands: Buru racket-tail (&quot;Prioniturus mada&quot;), black-lored parrot (&quot;Tanygnathus gramineus&quot;), blue-fronted lorikeet (&quot;Charmosyna toxopei&quot;), Buru honeyeater (&quot;Lichmera deningeri&quot;), Buru cuckooshrike (&quot;Coracina fortis&quot;), Buru jungle flycatcher (&quot;Rhinomyias additus&quot;), madanga (&quot;Madanga ruficollis&quot;), Buru white-eye (&quot;Zosterops buruensis&quot;), tawny-backed fantail (&quot;Rhipidura superflua&quot;) and Buru monarch (&quot;Monarcha loricatus&quot;). Among those, the rufous-throated white-eye is regarded as endangered and the black-lored parrot and vulnerable (threatened) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; both species were observed only in very limited areas of Buru island. There are another 19 birds that are near-endemic to Buru: rufous-necked sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter erythrauchen&quot;), dusky megapode (&quot;Megapodius forstenii&quot;), Moluccan megapode (&quot;Megapodius wallacei&quot;), white-eyed imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula perspicillata&quot;), long-tailed mountain pigeon (&quot;Gymnophaps mada&quot;), red lory (&quot;Eos bornea&quot;), Moluccan hawk-owl (&quot;Ninox squamipila&quot;), Moluccan masked owl (&quot;Tyto sororcula&quot;), Wakolo myzomela (&quot;Myzomela wakoloensis&quot;), Buru friarbird (&quot;Philemon moluccensis&quot;), drab whistler (&quot;Pachycephala griseonota&quot;), white-naped monarch (&quot;Monarcha pileatus&quot;), dark-grey flycatcher (&quot;Myiagra galeata&quot;), black-eared oriole (&quot;Oriolus bouroensis&quot;), pale cicadabird (&quot;Coracina ceramensis&quot;), Buru thrush (&quot;Zoothera dumasi&quot;), cinnamon-chested flycatcher (&quot;Ficedula buruensis&quot;), Buru bush warbler (&quot;Locustella disturbans&quot;) and Buru flowerpecker (&quot;Dicaeum erythrothorax&quot;). Among butterflies, 25% of the Pieridae and 7% of the Papilionidae found on Buru are endemic to the island.

The vegetation is characteristic of tropical lowland evergreen and semi-evergreen rain forests, with the dominant family of Dipterocarpaceae, genera of &quot;Hopea&quot;, &quot;Shorea&quot; and &quot;Vatica&quot;, and the individual species of &quot;Anisoptera thurifera&quot;, &quot;Hopea gregaria&quot;, &quot;Hopea iriana&quot;, &quot;Hopea novoguineensis&quot;, &quot;Shorea assamica&quot;, &quot;Shorea montigena&quot;, &quot;Shorea selanica&quot; and &quot;Vatica rassak&quot;. Some of these trees may grow to more than and are usually bound by thick lianas and other epiphytes. Open forest, woodland, and savanna areas also exist on Buru. The fire-resistant paper bark tree (&quot;Melaleuca cajuputi&quot;) is common in dry areas. The northwestern part of the island has steep limestone cliffs covered by mixed forests that include &quot;Shorea&quot; trees, and stunted &quot;Dacrydium novo-guineense&quot; is present at the mountain tops.

Primary forests constitute 60% of the island, and are mostly found in the areas of Air Buaya and Waeapo. There is only 0.51% of secondary forests, in the district Batabual, and 0.9% of mangroves, at Waeapo, Air Buaya, Batabual and Namlea. A significant part of the island (23.10%) is taken by shrubs, and only 5.83% is open land, which is spread over most districts of Buru.

== Administrative division ==
The island belongs to the Indonesian province of Maluku (). Until 1999, it was part of the Central Maluku Regency () and then became a separate regency of the same name. In 2008, it was split into Buru Regency () and South Buru Regency ().

Buru Regency has an area of 7,595.58 km2 and the administrative center at Namlea. It is divided into 10 districts: Namlea (center in Namlea), Waeapo (center – Waenetat), Waplau (center – Waplau), Batubual (center – Ilath), Teluk Kaiely (centre – Kaiely), Waelata (centre – Basakak), Lolong Guba (centre – Kubalahin), Lilialy (centre – Sawa), Air Buaya (center – Air Buaya) and Fena Leisela (center – Wamlana). The governor (Regent or , as of October 2009) is Husni Hentihu and Vice Regent is Ramli Umasugi.

South Buru Regency (administrative center Namrole) has an area of 5,060 km2 and includes Ambalau island southeast of Buru (and other small islets). Its governing structure had not been completed as of February 2010, and the current acting Regent was then A. R. Uluputti. The regency is divided into 6 districts: Namrole (centre – Elfule), Kepala Madan (centre – Biloro), Leksula (centre – Leksula), Fena Fafan (centre – Waekatin), Waesama (centre – Wamsisi), and Ambalau (centre – Siwar); the last district is entirely located on the island of Ambalau.

== Population ==
As of the 2010 Census, the population of the islands administered as Buru was 161,828 people; at the 2020 Census this had risen to 210,648 with about 64.2% in the northern regency and 35.8% in the southern; the official population estimate at-mid 2022 was 215,277. The southern regency included the smaller island of Ambalau to the southeast of Buru. In the early 2020s, most of the population was concentrated in the coastal areas, and comprised the following major groups: indigenous Buru (33,000 people), Lisela (13,000), Ambelau (6,000) and Kayeli people (800); migrants from Java, and migrants from other Maluku Islands. The migration to Buru was stimulated by the Dutch colonial administration in the 1900s, and by Indonesian authorities in the 1950s–1990s. The local communities speak Buru, Lisela and Ambelau languages in everyday life, however, the national Indonesian language is used as a means of international communication and is also used for writing. Also common is Ambon dialect of Malay language (&quot;Melayu Ambon&quot;). The latter is widely used in the Maluku Islands as a second language and is a simplified form of Indonesian language with additions of the local lexicon. Some local dialects, such as the Hukumina and Kayeli, became extinct in the second half of the 20th century.

Religious composition of the population is heterogeneous: the number of islanders practising Sunni Islam (90%) and Christianity (10%) and the rest – mainly residents of remote mountain areas – still follow traditional local cults or do not have a clear religious affiliation. . The economical crisis of the 1990s resulted in frequent conflicts among Buru people over religious grounds. So within a few days in December 1999, 43 people were killed and at least 150 houses burned in the Wainibe village.

== History ==

=== Precolonial period===
One of the first mentions of Buru occurred in the Nagarakretagama – an Old Javanese eulogy to Hayam Wuruk, the ruler of the Majapahit Kingdom, dating back to 1365. The island appears in the third line of 15th song in the list of lands subordinate to Majapahit under the name Hutan Kadali.

In the 16th–17th centuries Buru was claimed by the rulers of Ternate island and by the Portuguese; both claims were, however, symbolic, as neither party controlled the island, but only visited it on trade matters. More active were Makassar people from Sulawesi island, who had built fortifications on Buru and forced the natives to grow valuable spices, such as clove.

=== Colonial period ===


The rivalry between the Makassar and Dutch East India Company for control over production and trade in spices in the east of the Malay archipelago resulted in military conflict. In 1648, a Dutch expedition to Buru expelled the Makassar from the island and destroyed their buildings and boats; instead of re-using the existing clove plantations, the Dutch burned more than three thousand trees, as they were not in position to settle on the island and were afraid that the Makassar might return after their departure. They returned after several years and raised a fortress armed with four cannon and staffed by 24 soldiers in 1658 at the southern coast of Kayeli Bay, in the eastern part of Buru. A permanent settlement was established at the fortress, which became the administrative center of the island. About 2,000 native inhabitants of the island were forcibly relocated to this area from other parts of the island, including much of the tribal nobility, and about thirteen large villages were built around the fort: Lumaite, Hukumina, Palamata, Tomahu, Masarete, Waisama, Marulat, Leliali, Tagalisa, Ilat, Kayeli, Bara and Lisela. The relocation was designed to facilitate control over the local population and provide a workforce for clove fields which were being planted by the Dutch in this part of the island. The Kayeli ethnicity with its own language was formed as a mixture of the newly arriving settlers and the native population of the fort area.

The presence among the ancestors of the tribal aristocracy and interaction with the Dutch colonial administration resulted in a special position for the Kayeli over the next centuries, who claimed the role of indigenous elite of the island. In particularly, they requested donations from each clan of Buru, which could be rice, millet, coconuts, sago, sweet potatoes and tobacco, as well as supplying men to work exclusively for the Kayeli rajas.

The Dutch East India Company was abolished in the early 19th century, and all its possessions in the Malay archipelago came under the direct control of the Dutch crown. In 1824, as part of the reform of the colonial administration, Buru was divided into 14 regencies (this number was gradually reduced to seven over the next 100 years). They were headed by the local rulers, rajas, who were subordinate to the Dutch advisors. All rajas were selected from the Kayeli tribal nobles, who had by this time proved their loyalty to the Dutch.

The demise of Kayeli dominance began in the 1880s, when the leaders of Leliali, Wae Sama and Fogi clans moved significant parts of their ethnic groups to their original settlements; they were joined in the early 1900s by Tagalisa. By then, many other of the original 13 Kayeli villages were either abandoned or had lost their rajas. By about 1910, the leading role of the Kayeli clan had almost disappeared.

=== Transition years 1942–1950 ===
From the spring of 1942 to the summer of 1945, the entire Dutch East Indies, including Buru, were occupied by the Japanese army. During this period, the island was raided by the bombers of the Allies aiming to incapacitate the Japanese military infrastructure, in particular the airport at Namlea, the major town of Buru.

After the capitulation of Japan on 2 September 1945, control over the island fell back to the Netherlands. In December 1946, Buru, along with the other Maluku Islands, Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda Islands, was included in a quasi-independent State of East Indonesia () which was established by the Dutch government to gradually transform their former colonial possessions in the East Indies into a dependent state. In December 1949, eastern Indonesia joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia ( RIS) established at the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 23 August – 2 November 1949.

In April 1950, just before the abolition of RIS and inclusion of most of eastern Indonesia to the Republic of Indonesia, the local authorities of Buru, Ambon, Seram and several smaller nearby islands proclaimed the establishment of an independent Republic of South Moluccas (, RMS) and committed to maintain close political ties with the Netherlands. After unsuccessful attempts to absorb the RMS through negotiations, the Republic of Indonesia initiated a six-month military conflict in July 1950. In December 1950, Buru was brought under the control of Indonesian troops and proclaimed part of the Republic of Indonesia.

===As part of Indonesia===
Between 1950 and 1965, the policy of the new government was aimed at rapid social, political and economic integration of Buru into Indonesia. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military regime of General Soeharto, Buru became one of the main places of exile and imprisonment of political dissidents – primarily communists and other left-wing representatives, as well as dissident intellectuals. Most camps were closed on Buru in 1980. More than 12,000 people had served a prison sentence in those camps by then, and at least several hundred had died or been killed.

One of the prisoners was a prominent Indonesian writer, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, who spent 14 years (1965–1979) in prison, mostly on Buru, and wrote there many of his novels. Those included a large part of &quot;Buru Quartet&quot;, in particular its first part &quot;This Earth of Mankind&quot;. Until 1975, Toer was deprived of writing tools. He committed his novels to memory and was reciting them to his cellmates, partly relying on their memory.

During the late 1970s, a number of transmigrants from Java arrived at Buru. These transmigrants, along with the political prisoners, established thousands of hectares of rice fields on the island and built irrigation systems in the Waeapo River alluvial plain, significantly increasing local rice production and making it the largest rice producer in the Maluku Islands.

== Economy ==
Economic development of the island was depressed in the late 1990s as a result of the national and regional crisis. The growth resumed in the early 2000s, however, unemployment remains high (9.92% of the population in 2008), and more than 37% of islanders are living below the national poverty line ().

The basis of the island&#x27;s economy is agriculture which contributed 51.22% to the GDP in 2008. The major crop is rice with plantations taking an area of more than 5,700 hectares and yielding about 23,000 tonnes per the year (for 2008) in just Buru Regency. Most rice fields are located on the northern coasts of the island, in the districts of Namlea, Waeapo and Air Buaya. With the total area of 135 hectares, maize dominates the southern field of districts Waisama, Kepalamadan and Namrole, yielding 176 tonnes per year (). Other crops of the southern part are sweet potato (211 hectares, 636 tonnes), beans (926 hectares, 946 tonnes ) and soybeans (965 hectares, 965 tonnes). Coco (5,724 ha, 2,742 tonnes), cocoa (4,453 ha, 2,368 tonnes), clove (947 ha, 881 tonnes) and coffee (, 1223 tonnes) are grown in the Namlea, Air Buaya, Waeapo, Batubual and Waplau areas, whereas nutmeg (143 ha, 75 tonnes) is restricted to Batubual. Teak plantations are found almost everywhere on Buru and complement the natural sources of timber.

Animal farming is of secondary importance, but its role is gradually increasing. The major animals are cows (41,349 animals ), buffalo (3,699), chickens (more than 1,346,000), ducks (195,000), sheep (26,950), domestic pigs (1,276) and horses (497). In 2008, there were 410 fishing enterprises with the annual catch of 3,891 tonnes of fish and seafood. The major commercial species are tuna (900 tonnes), sardines (420 tonnes) and mackerel (385 tonnes).

The industry employs only about 2,700 islanders and contributes about 7% to the GDP. Among the 537 enterprises registered in 2008, 482 were engaged in processing of agricultural products and 44 in engineering, chemicals and repair. In January 2010, the Ministry of Industry of Indonesia has approved a plan to build major cement plants on the island. The expansion of tourism is hindered by the lack of infrastructure on the island.

Apart from agriculture and engineering, other significant economic areas are trade, hotel industry and catering (19.19% of GDP in 2008), custom services (12.74%), transport and communication (3.10%), construction (3.13%), financial sector (2.64%) and energy and water (0.49%).

== Transportation ==
Buru is linked with other parts of Indonesia via sea routes and has two main ports in Namlea and Namrole. With 866 registered cargo and passenger vessels, the average transport rate in 2008 was 400 tonnes per day. Speedboats &quot;Bahari Express&quot; run daily between Namlea and the capital of Maluku Province, Ambon (distance 160 km, travel time three hours).

By agreement between the administration of Buru district and local military authorities, the military airfield at Namlea (runway 750 meters) is used for air transportation. Aircraft CASA C-212 Aviocar make 96 passenger flights a year between Namlea and several towns of Maluku. In 2007, construction began of a civil airport near the villages of Suva and Namrole, about 30 km south-west of Namlea.

In absence of railways, most local transportation occurs via the roads. In 2008, their total length was 1,310 km, of which 278 km was covered with asphalt, 282 km with gravel and the rest were laid in soil. The construction project of a modern, highway across the island, connecting its two major towns of Namlea and Namrole and several other towns is delayed due to underfunding. There is a regular long-distance bus service supported by a park of 18 units.

== Health ==
, the medical system of the island was in a poor state due to underfunding and lack of qualified medical personnel. There were 2 hospitals and 16 clinics, 5 of which were first-aid clinics and 11 were serving non-emergency patients who could arrive there on their own. The medical staff consisted of 22 doctors (two with the medical degree), 65 obstetricians and 303 nurses. The authorities plan to increase the number of medical facilities and staff by 2–4 times by 2012.

==Traditional occupations and culture==
Whereas local people traditionally occupied villages, variation of their seasonal activities – predominantly hunting and farming – tended to either disperse or gather them. Men hunted the wild pig Buru babirusa, deer and possum, in the forests, mostly during the peak of east monsoon (June and July); meanwhile women were gathering wild vegetables. However, during the west monsoon (November to April) both men and women were working together in the fields. The position of the villages was also changing with time, mostly because of the low soil fertility on the island – recovery of the soil took significant time urging long-distance travel to the new fields. It was rather common for a family to leave the village for most of the week to their field and return only for the religious service on Sunday. It was also rather common to move the entire village after some 20 years of exploiting a plot of land. Partly because of this, most settlements were rather small, with the smallest type accommodating one-two families (&quot;hum-hawa&quot; or &quot;hum-tapa&quot;), middle-type (&quot;hum-lolin&quot;) consisting of 3–10 houses and accommodating 20–50 people, and larger ones of 30–50 houses and 150–300 people (&quot;fen-lale&quot;). On the coast, there were several multi-ethnic settlements with more than 200 houses (&quot;ibu kota kecamatan&quot;). This local variety of terms for a &quot;settlement&quot; puzzled the Dutch colonizers trying to systematise the local registries.

Traditional Buru houses were made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs were covered with palm leaves or reeds. Cement, metal and tiles were introduced in the 20th century and urged to build more permanent dwelling, but with limited results, as the locals continued to relocate. This was partly due to the habits of relocation and partly due to local disputes or superstitions, such as cursing a place where a certain number of people died within a short period. Presence of a church in a village might hinder relocation for a century, but not always. Traditional Buru costumes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the dress color systematically varies between the different tribes of the island.

== Research ==
The unique flora, fauna and tropical forest ecosystem of the island are systematically researched by both Indonesian and foreign scientific bodies. The original vegetation on the coastal plain has been cleared, and much of the mountain forest on the northern side of the island has been cut and burned out for timber and creating new farming fields, but two large areas of stable rain forest still exist in the mountains. These are currently protected areas, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km2) and Waeapo (50 km2).

Most of the published studies on the history, culture and languages of the island were conducted in the 1980s out by spouses Charles E. Grimes and Barbara Dix Grimes – Australian missionaries and ethnographers and active members of SIL International (they should not be confused with Joseph E. Grimes and Barbara F. Grimes, Charles&#x27; parents, also known Australian ethnographers). They have also completed translation of the Bible to Buru language, which was started by the early Dutch missionaries.

<doc id="869678" wikidata="Q4577286" url="?curid=869678" title="1976 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1976 Republican National Convention was a United States political convention of the Republican Party that met from August 16 to August 19, 1976, to select the party&#x27;s nominees for president and vice president. Held in Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri, the convention nominated President Gerald Ford for a full term, but only after narrowly defeating a strong challenge from former California Governor Ronald Reagan. The convention also nominated Senator Bob Dole from Kansas for vice president, instead of Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who did not seek nomination for a full term. The keynote address was delivered by Tennessee Senator Howard Baker. Other notable speakers included Minnesota Representative Al Quie, retired Lieutenant Colonel and former Vietnam prisoner of war Raymond Schrump, former Democratic Texas Governor John Connally, Providence, Rhode Island mayor Vincent Cianci and Michigan Senator Robert P. Griffin. It is the last national convention by either of the two major parties to feature a seriously contested nomination between candidates.

==History==

Kansas City had not hosted a major party convention since the 1928 Republican National Convention that nominated Herbert Hoover. Its premier venue, Kemper Arena, was diminutive by national standards but it was new, and the city aggressively courted the convention planners of both parties. The Democrats demurred early on, citing a lack of hotel accommodations, but Republicans were more receptive because the city had a reliably enthusiastic base of the party, and &quot;fit the Midwestern image of Jerry Ford&quot;.

===Situation at the opening of the convention===
Going into the convention, Ford had won more primary delegates than Reagan, as well as a plurality in popular vote. However, Ford did not have enough delegates to secure the nomination (1,130 delegates were needed to win the presidential nomination), and as the convention opened both candidates were seen as still having a chance to win. Because of this, both Ford and Reagan arrived in Kansas City before the convention opened to woo the remaining uncommitted delegates in an effort to secure the nomination.

Reagan benefited from his highly committed delegates, notably &quot;Reagan&#x27;s Raiders&quot; of the Texas delegation. They and other conservative Western and Southern delegates particularly faulted the Ford Administration&#x27;s foreign policy of détente towards the Soviet Union, criticizing his signing of the Helsinki Accords and indirectly blaming him for the April 1975 Fall of Saigon.

The pro-Reagan Texas delegates worked hard to persuade delegates from other states to support Reagan.

Ford, meanwhile, used all of the perks and patronage of the presidency to win over wavering delegates, including trips aboard Air Force One and personal meetings with Ford himself. White House Chief of Staff Dick Cheney proved to be an important figure in working to build support among those state delegations on the fence between Ford and Reagan, including the Mississippi delegation. White House political advisor Harry Dent also played a central role in helping President Ford work with the state delegations, who met with Ford and his aides in a presidential office set up on-site at the convention in Kansas City.
Headlines during the Republican convention in Kansas City hinted at the still-simmering debates within the rank-and-file of the Republicans as to whether or not a new party might be formed out of the weaknesses of the Republicans. &quot;Conservatives Seek a New Party if Reagan Loses,&quot; The Chicago Tribune&#x27;s Wednesday, August 18, 1976, headlines told readers during the Kansas City convention, which quoted both White House aides as well as critics in the Republican Party who debated the possibility of a new party emerging out of that year&#x27;s division in the Republican ranks.

Newspaper headlines also told the story of the uncommitted delegates whose &quot;wavering&quot; at the convention made them the focus of both the Ford and the Reagan camps. &quot;New &#x27;Stars&#x27; Stealing GOP Show,&quot; The Chicago Tribune&#x27;s Wednesday, August 18, 1976, headlines told readers. Estimates ranged from 93 to as many as 115 delegates uncommitted at the time of the convention. The largest block of uncommitted delegates were from Mississippi and another block were from Illinois&#x27;s delegation.

Wednesday, August 18, 1976, saw the uncommitted delegates break on the 1st ballot for President Gerald Ford, who won the nomination on the 1st roll call of delegates by a vote of 1,187-1,070.

===Richard Schweiker gambit and the search for an alternative===
Reagan had promised, if nominated, to name Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania as his running mate, in a bid to attract liberals and centrists in the party. This move backfired, however, as many conservatives (such as North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms) were infuriated by Reagan&#x27;s choice of the &quot;liberal&quot; Schweiker, while few moderate delegates switched to Reagan. Helms promptly began a movement to draft Conservative Senator James L. Buckley of New York as the presidential nominee.

===Platform and rules votes===
The key vote of the convention occurred when Reagan&#x27;s managers proposed a rules change that would have required Ford to publicly announce his running mate before the presidential balloting. Reagan&#x27;s managers hoped that when Ford announced his choice for vice president, it would anger one of the two factions of the party and thus help Reagan. Ford&#x27;s supporters derisively described the proposed rules change as the &quot;misery loves company&quot; amendment. The proposed rules change was defeated by a vote of 1180 to 1069, and Ford gained the momentum he needed to win the presidential nomination. The balloting was still close, however, as Ford won with 1187 votes to 1070 votes for Reagan (and one for Elliot Richardson of Massachusetts).

Conservatives succeeded in inserting several key planks into the party platform, some of which were implicitly critical of the President&#x27;s own policies. Reagan and Senator Jesse Helms successfully had a &quot;moral foreign policy&quot; plank inserted. In light of the 1973 &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, the 1976 Republican platform became the first to advocate a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution, despite the fact that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; had been a 7–2 decision, and 5 of the 7 (Burger, Stewart, Brennan, Blackmun, and Powell) had been appointed to the Supreme Court by Republican presidents.

==Balloting==
===Presidential===

===Vice presidential===
Ford selected Kansas Senator Robert J. Dole as his running mate, as unelected incumbent Vice President Rockefeller had announced the previous fall that he would not be a candidate for a full term in 1976.

After Ronald Reagan lost the presidential ballot to incumbent Gerald Ford, 103 of his delegates walked out of the convention, and the remainder decided to scatter their votes among 30 people. Bob Dole prevailed by an overwhelming margin.
* Bob Dole – 1,921 (85.04%)

* Abstaining – 103 (4.56%)
==Reagan&#x27;s concession speech==

There was no scheduled time slot for the runner-up to deliver a formal concession speech; however, when Ford and Reagan met on the dais after Ford&#x27;s acceptance speech, the president insisted that the former governor accompany him to the podium to deliver a few remarks.

Reagan gave an eloquent and stirring speech that overshadowed Ford&#x27;s own acceptance address, despite being little more than five minutes long. Some delegates later stated that they left the convention wondering if they had voted for the wrong candidate. A contemporary media account stated that if a motion to reconsider the nomination had been in order, it might have passed.

== Aftermath ==
Ford and Dole went on to lose to Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in the 1976 election. Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 election to become president, and won again in 1984, beating Democratic challenger Mondale.

<doc id="869679" wikidata="Q2993844" url="?curid=869679" title="Executive Council of Ontario">
<text>The Executive Council of Ontario (), often informally referred to as the Cabinet of Ontario (), is the cabinet of the Canadian province of Ontario. It comprises ministers of the provincial Crown, who are selected by the premier of Ontario (the first minister of the Crown) and appointed by the lieutenant governor. The activities of the Government of Ontario are directed by the Executive Council.

The Executive Council is almost always made up of members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Though the lieutenant governor does not generally attend Cabinet meetings, directives issued by the Crown on the advice of the ministers are said to be ordered by the &quot;Lieutenant Governor-in-Council&quot;. Ministers hold the honorific prefix &quot;The Honourable&quot; while members of the council.

The Cabinet is similar in structure and role to the federal Privy Council for Canada, though smaller in size, and, whereas the federal Cabinet is actually a committee of the Privy Council, the Executive Council of Ontario and Cabinet of Ontario are one and the same. Also, unlike the Privy Council, members of the Ontario Executive Council are not appointed for life, and are not entitled to post-nominal letters.

==Current Cabinet==

<text>Bernardo Vicente de Gálvez y Madrid, 1st Count of Gálvez (23 July 1746 – 30 November 1786) was a Spanish military leader and government official who served as colonial governor of Spanish Louisiana and Cuba, and later as Viceroy of New Spain.

A career soldier since the age of 16, Gálvez was a veteran of several wars across Europe, the Americas, and North Africa. While governor of Louisiana, he supported the colonists and their French allies in the American Revolutionary War, helping facilitate vital supply lines and frustrate British operations in the Gulf Coast. Gálvez achieved several victories on the battlefield, most notably conquering West Florida and eliminating the British naval presence in the Gulf. This campaign led to the formal return of all of Florida to Spain in the Treaty of Paris, which he played a role in drafting.

Gálvez&#x27;s actions aided the American war effort and made him a hero to both Spain and the newly independent United States. The U.S. Congress endeavored to hang his portrait in the Capitol, finally doing so in 2014. He was granted many titles and honors by the Spanish government, which in 1783 appointed him viceroy of one of its most valuable territories, New Spain, succeeding his father Matías de Gálvez y Gallardo. He served until his death from typhus.

While somewhat forgotten in the United States, Gálvez remains in high esteem among many Americans, particularly in the southern and western states that once formed part of Spain&#x27;s North American territory. Gálvez Day is celebrated as a local holiday in Pensacola, and several places bear his name, including Galveston, Texas and Galvez, Louisiana. In 2014, Gálvez became one of only eight people to have been awarded honorary U.S. citizenship.

==Origins and military career==
Bernardo de Gálvez was born in Macharaviaya, a mountain village in the province of Málaga, Spain, on 23 July 1746. He was the son of Matías de Gálvez and his wife María Josefa de Madrid, who died when Bernardo was only 2 years old. He studied military sciences at the &quot;Academia de Ávila&quot; and at the age of 16 participated in the Spanish invasion of Portugal, which stalled after the Spanish had captured Almeida. Following the conflict he was promoted to infantry lieutenant. He arrived in Mexico, which was then part of New Spain, in 1769. As a captain, he fought the Apaches, with his Opata Indian allies. He received many wounds, several of them serious. In 1770, he was promoted to commandant of arms of Nueva Vizcaya and Sonora, northern provinces of Mexico.

In 1772, Gálvez returned to Spain with his uncle, José de Gálvez. Later, he was sent to Pau, France, where he served with the Royal Cantabria regiment, an elite Franco-Spanish unit, for three years. There, he learned to speak French, which would serve him well when he became governor of Louisiana. Gálvez was transferred to Seville in 1775, and then participated in Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s disastrous expedition to Algiers, where he was seriously wounded during the Spanish assault on the fortress that guarded the city. Afterward he was appointed a professor at the military academy of Ávila and promoted to lieutenant colonel; he was made colonel in 1776.

==Spanish governor of Louisiana==
On 1 January 1777, Bernardo de Gálvez became the new governor of the formerly French province of Louisiana, the vast territory that would later become the object of the Louisiana Purchase. The colony had been ceded by France to Spain in 1762, ostensibly as compensation for the loss of Florida to Britain, after Spain was urged to enter the Seven Years&#x27; War on the French side.

In November 1777, Gálvez married Marie Félicité de Saint-Maxent d&#x27;Estrehan, the Creole daughter of the French-born Gilbert Antoine de Saint-Maxent and the Creole Elizabeth La Roche, and young widow of Jean Baptiste Honoré d&#x27;Estrehan, the son of a high ranking French colonial official. This marriage to the daughter of a Frenchman won Gálvez the favor of the local Creole population. They had three children, Miguel, Matilde, and Guadalupe.

As governor, Gálvez enacted an anti-British policy, taking measures against British smuggling and promoting trade with France. He damaged British interests in the region and kept it open for supplies to reach George Washington&#x27;s army during the American Revolutionary War. He founded Galvez Town in 1779, promoted the colonization of &quot;Nueva Iberia&quot;, and established free trade with Cuba and Yucatán. Galvez Street in New Orleans is named for him. In 1779, Gálvez was promoted to brigadier.

==American Revolutionary War==

In December 1776, King Charles III of Spain decided that covert assistance to the United States would be strategically useful, but Spain did not enter into a formal alliance with the U.S. In 1777, José de Gálvez, newly appointed as minister of the Council of the Indies, sent his nephew, Bernardo de Gálvez, to New Orleans as governor of &quot;Luisiana&quot; with instructions to secure the friendship of the United States. On 20 February 1777, the Spanish king&#x27;s ministers in Madrid secretly instructed Gálvez to sell the Americans desperately needed supplies. The British had blockaded the colonial ports of the Thirteen Colonies, and consequently the route from New Orleans up the Mississippi River was an effective alternative. Gálvez worked with Oliver Pollock, an American patriot, to ship gunpowder, muskets, uniforms, medicine, and other supplies to the American colonial rebels.

On October 31, 1778, the Continental Congress issued a resolution thanking de Gálvez for his &quot;spirited and disinterested conduct towards these states&quot;.

Although Spain had not yet joined the American cause, when an American raiding expedition led by James Willing showed up in New Orleans with booty and several captured British ships taken as prizes, Gálvez refused to turn the Americans over to the British. In 1779, Spanish forces commanded by Gálvez seized the province of West Florida, later known as the Florida Parishes, from the British. Spain&#x27;s motive was the chance both to recover territories lost to the British, particularly Florida, and to remove the ongoing British threat.
On 21 June 1779, Spain formally declared war on Great Britain. On 25 June, a letter from London, marked secret and confidential, went to General John Campbell at Pensacola from King George III and Lord George Germain. Campbell was instructed that it was the object of greatest importance to organize an attack upon New Orleans. If Campbell thought it was possible to reduce the Spanish fort at New Orleans, he was ordered to make preparations immediately. These included securing from Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Parker as many fighting ships as the fleet at Jamaica could spare, gathering all forces in the province that could be assembled, recruiting as many loyal Indians as the Superintendent could provide, and drawing on His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury through the Lords Commissioners to pay expenses. As an unfortunate twist of fate for Campbell, upon which his whole career was decided, the secret communication fell into the hands of Gálvez. After reading the communication from King George III and Germain, Gálvez, as Governor of Louisiana, swiftly and secretly mobilized the territory for war.

Gálvez carried out a masterful military campaign and defeated the British colonial forces at Fort Bute, Baton Rouge, and Natchez in 1779. The Battle of Baton Rouge, on 21 September 1779, freed the lower Mississippi Valley of British forces and relieved the threat to the capital of Louisiana, New Orleans. In March 1780, Gálvez recaptured Mobile from the British at the Battle of Fort Charlotte.

Gálvez&#x27;s most important military victory over the British forces occurred 8 May 1781, when he attacked and took by land and by sea Pensacola, the British (and formerly, Spanish) capital of West Florida from General John Campbell of Strachur. The loss of Mobile and Pensacola left the British with no bases along the Gulf coast.

In 1782, forces under Gálvez&#x27;s overall command captured the British naval base at Nassau on New Providence Island in the Bahamas without a shot being fired. However, Gálvez&#x27;s was angry that the operation had proceeded against his orders and ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Francisco de Miranda, aide-de-camp of Juan Manuel Cajigal, the commander of the expedition. Miranda later explained Gálvez&#x27;s actions as stemming from jealousy of Cajigal&#x27;s success.
On May 9, 1783, the Congressional Congress issued a resolution to display a portrait painting of de Gálvez which was obtained by Oliver Pollock &quot;...in the room in which Congress meet.&quot;
Gálvez received many honors from Spain for his military victories against the British, including promotion to lieutenant general and field marshal, governor and captain general of Louisiana and Florida (now separated from Cuba), and the command of the Spanish expeditionary army in America, and titles of Viscount of Gálvez-Town and Count of Gálvez. As evidenced by the insignia that he wore in most every official portrait painting of him, de Gálvez was also awarded the Order of Charles III. However, his insignia was different from the Knight&#x27;s Cross Order of Charles III; on his, the medallion was connected to the ribbon by a crown device, whereas the Knight&#x27;s Cross was connected via a wreath.

The American Revolutionary War ended while de Gálvez was preparing a new campaign to take Jamaica. From the American perspective, Gálvez&#x27;s campaign denied the British the opportunity of encircling the American rebels from the south and kept open a vital conduit for supplies. He also assisted the American revolutionaries with supplies and soldiers, much of it through Oliver Pollock, from whom he received military intelligence concerning the British in West Florida. For France and Spain, Gálvez&#x27;s military success in the American war effort led to the inclusion of provisions in the Peace of Paris (1783) that officially returned Florida, now divided into two provinces, East and West Florida, to Spain. The treaty recognized the political independence of the former British colonies to the north, and its signing ended their war with the British.

==Viceroy of New Spain==
In 1783, Bernardo de Gálvez was ennobled to the rank of count, promoted to lieutenant-general of the army, and appointed governor and captain-general of Cuba. He was given the titles Count of Gálvez (&quot;conde de Gálvez&quot;) and Viscount of Gálvez-Town (&quot;vizconde de Gálvez-Town&quot;) by Carlos III on May 20, 1783. He returned to the Indies in October of the following year to assume his new office. Shortly after he arrived in Havana, his father, Matías de Gálvez y Gallardo (then the viceroy of New Spain), died in November, and Bernardo de Gálvez was appointed to fill the position. He arrived in Vera Cruz, on 21 May 1785, and made his formal entry into Mexico City in June.

During his administration two great calamities occurred: the freeze of September 1785, which led to famine in 1786, and a typhus epidemic that killed 300,000 people the same year. During the famine, Gálvez donated 12,000 pesos of his inheritance and 100,000 pesos he raised from other sources to buy maize and beans for the populace. He also implemented policies to increase future agricultural production.

In 1785, Gálvez initiated construction of Chapultepec Castle. He also ordered the construction of the towers of the cathedral and paving of the streets, as well as the installation of streetlights in Mexico City. He continued work on the highway to Acapulco, and took measures to reduce the abuse of Indian labor on the project. He dedicated 16% of the income from the lottery and other games of chance to charity.

Gálvez helped advance science in the colony by sponsoring the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain, led by Martín Sessé y Lacasta. This expedition of botanists and naturalists resulted in a comprehensive catalog, a collaborative work published in Spain as the &quot;Flora Mexicana&quot;, which catalogued the diverse species of plants, birds, and fish found in New Spain.

On one occasion, when the viceroy was riding on horseback to meet with the Audiencia (according to his own report), he encountered a party of soldiers escorting three criminals to the gallows. He suspended the hanging, and later had the criminals freed.

After the typhus epidemic of 1786 had abated in early autumn, Bernardo de Gálvez apparently became one of its last victims, and was confined to his bed. On 8 November 1786, he turned over all his governmental duties except the captain generalship to the Audiencia. On 30 November 1786, Galvez died at the age of 40 in Tacubaya (now part of Mexico City). Gálvez was buried next to his father at San Fernando Church in Mexico City.

Bernardo de Gálvez left some writings, including &quot;Ordenanzas para el Teatro de Comedias de México&quot; and &quot;Instrución para el Buen Gobierno de las Provincias Internas de la Nueva España&quot; (Instructions for Governing the Interior Provinces of New Spain, 1786), the latter of which remained in effect until the colonial period ended. In his &quot;Instructions&quot;, Gálvez advocated a policy of selling the Indians rifles and trade goods to make them dependent on the Spanish government, and sanctioned war against the Apache if these inducements failed to pacify them.

==Legacy==

Galveston, Texas, Galveston Bay, Galveston County, Galvez, Louisiana, and St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, were, among other places, named after him. The Louisiana parishes of East Feliciana and West Feliciana (originally a single parish) were said to have been named for his wife Marie Felicite de Saint-Maxent d&#x27;Estrehan.

The Cabildo, a branch of the Louisiana State Museum located on Jackson Square in New Orleans, has a portrait of General Gálvez accompanied by a display of biographical information. Spanish Plaza, in the Central Business District of the city, has an equestrian statue of Gálvez adjacent to the New Orleans World Trade Center. There is also a Galvez Street in New Orleans. Mobile, Alabama, also has a Spanish Plaza with a statue of Gálvez.

In Baton Rouge, Louisiana (present-day state capital), Galvez Plaza is laid out next to City Hall and used frequently as a site for municipal events. Also, the 13-story Galvez Building is part of the state government&#x27;s administrative office-building complex in the Capitol Park section of downtown Baton Rouge.

In 1911, the Hotel Galvez was built in Galveston Avenue P, where the hotel is located, is known as Bernardo de Galvez Avenue. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 4 April 1979.

On December 16, 2014, the United States Congress conferred honorary citizenship on Gálvez, citing him as a &quot;hero of the Revolutionary War who risked his life for the freedom of the United States people and provided supplies, intelligence, and strong military support to the war effort.&quot; In 2019, the Spanish Government placed a statue of Galvez in front of the Spanish Embassy in Washington, D.C. Also, on December 9, 2014, a replica of a 1784 portrait of Gálvez by Mariano Salvador Maella—the replica of which was painted by Spanish artist Carlos Monserrate—was unveiled December 9, 2014, in Senate Foreign Relations Committee room (S-116 of the United States Capitol Building). This act fulfilled the May 9, 1783, resolution to display such a portrait of de Gálvez in Congress.

In June 2024, the USS &quot;Galvez&quot; (FFG-67), a Constellation-class frigate, was named after him.

<text>B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires is a horizontally scrolling video game designed by Rick Banks and Michael Bate and published by Sierra On-Line in 1983. Versions were released for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision, ZX Spectrum, MSX, and Apple II. Based on the comic strip &quot;B.C.&quot; by Johnny Hart, &quot;BC&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; is similar to Irem&#x27;s &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; from the previous year. A wheel-riding caveman is always moving forward through horizontally scrolling levels, and the player jumps or ducks as obstacles approach. The game&#x27;s title is a play on the contemporaneous film &quot;Quest for Fire&quot;.

Both &quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; and &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; have key elements of the not-yet-invented endless runner genre, despite both games being divided into discrete levels.

A sequel, &quot;Grog&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, was released in 1984.

==Plot==
The player takes the role of the caveman Thor, who has to rescue his girlfriend, &quot;Cute Chick&quot;, who has been kidnapped by a dinosaur. To do this, he must travel on his stone unicycle (actually an impossible wheel) through several levels. Each level has Thor moving from the left to the right, avoiding various dangers.

==Gameplay==
&quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; is an action game taking place on several consecutive levels. Each level consists of Thor having to jump over obstacles such as rocks or stalagmites and ducking under others, like tree branches or stalactites. In between each level is a brief challenge (a precursor to boss battles in later games). The first challenge has Thor jumping on turtles to cross a lake while trying to avoid being hit by the Fat Broad, another has Thor lining up with the Dookie Bird to catch a ride over a lava pit, another challenge has Thor trying to gain enough speed to jump another pit, and the final challenge has Thor jumping on turtles to cross another lake while trying to sneak past the dinosaur. 

==Reception==
&quot;Softline&quot; stated that, given the conventional gameplay (&quot;it&#x27;s that get-from-point-A-to-point-B kind of game&quot;), the use of the familiar comic characters made &quot;the player feel like finishing the game is worthwhile ... [Otherwise] it&#x27;s just not the same&quot;. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; isn&#x27;t so much a computer game as it is an interactive cartoon. This cartoon has its limits, but it does provide some challenge&quot;. &quot;Antic&quot; approved of the game not being another &quot;&#x27;shoot the aliens and save the world&#x27; scenario&quot;, and the &quot;first rate&quot; animation, but predicted that most players would &quot;enjoy the game for a day or two, then relegate it to the shelf&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; praised the game&#x27;s &quot;excellent graphics&quot; and animation, which &quot;approach cartoon standards&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited it as an entertaining arcade game. David Stone reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and stated that &quot;QFT requires far more timing than strategy and, rather than levels of play, it offers new obstacles to overcome on the way to the rescue. Still, it is fun to play.&quot;

The game sold a million copies.

<doc id="869694" wikidata="Q1041871" url="?curid=869694" title="In It for the Money">
<text>In It for the Money is the second studio album by English alternative rock band Supergrass, released in 1997. &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;more fun than watching a wombat in a washing machine&quot; and named it the 10th best album of the year. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted it the 68th greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 57 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.

== Recording and conception ==
Only two songs were written before entering Sawmills Studio, so most of the tracks were penned during recording itself.

Recording was often disrupted by the drummer Danny Goffey impromptly going back to London, to record with his and Pearl Lowe&#x27;s band Lodger. He was told by management that this was unacceptable behaviour. This, along with Gaz Coombes and Goffey&#x27;s bickering in the music press about the underlying meaning of lyrics to &quot;Going Out&quot;, put strain on the recording process.

It is speculated that Parlophone, the record label Supergrass were on, offered the band a sum of money to decide on a final name for the album, because they were taking too long to deliberate. However, the band themselves claim that they never received any of this money in return. Other suggestions considered for the title of the album included &quot;Hold on to the Handrail&quot; and &quot;Children of the Monkey Basket&quot; (which is now the name of the band&#x27;s self-run website).

&quot;Richard III&quot; and &quot;Sun Hits the Sky&quot; appear to end with snippets of other, unreleased songs, that play until fade out.

The guitar solo in &quot;Sometimes I Make You Sad&quot; was written during the recording of &quot;In It for the Money&quot;; it was recorded at half speed then sped up to achieve the mandolin-like sound. The only use of percussion in the song is a cymbal, the drum noises were instead simulated by members of the band making &#x27;grunting&#x27; noises. These were then put on a loop.

==Album artwork==
The album cover is a photograph of the band busking during the filming of the video for their single &quot;Cheapskate&quot;. The Japanese edition has, instead, an oil painting by Maff Burley, an old school friend of Danny Goffey. In it, the band is curled up in a circular window at the Old Sawmills at Fowey.

== Reception ==
The album was critically acclaimed, and peaked at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, and sold 300,000 copies in the UK and over one million worldwide. &quot;The fact that it has sold more worldwide than &quot;I Should Coco&quot;,&quot; said Gaz Coombes, &quot;means we can sleep at night.&quot;

&quot;&quot;In It for the Money&quot; is my favourite album of the year…&quot; declared The Prodigy&#x27;s Liam Howlett at the close of 1997. &quot;It&#x27;s quality music. &#x27;Richard III&#x27; is a top punk tune – that&#x27;s why I bought the album.&quot;

The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="869700" wikidata="Q5115643" url="?curid=869700" title="Chuck Norris Superkicks">
<text>Chuck Norris Superkicks is a video game produced by Xonox in 1984. It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks and Super Kung Fu when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired. The game was produced for the Commodore 64, VIC-20, Atari 2600, and ColecoVision as part of Xonox&#x27;s double-ender cartridge line (cartridges with two games and two connectors that were flipped over depending on which one the user wanted to play).

== Gameplay==
In &quot;Chuck Norris Superkicks&quot;, Norris must reach a monastery within six minutes. The player controls Chuck Norris on a vertically-scrolling overworld. Norris must walk along a path, and if he steps in the grass, time is lost at a faster rate. Warriors ambush Norris as he walks, causing him to enter battle.

While in battle, Norris faces three enemies, one at a time, who run back and forth and throw shurikens. If an enemy hits Norris, he is knocked down and vulnerable to attacks. If a shuriken hits him, the player loses time and Norris is sent back to the start of the path. Norris has three moves: punch, kick, and block which can be used by pressing the attack button while moving the stick in a certain direction. Pressing the button without moving the stick will make Norris do nothing. The block protects Norris from shurikens, while the punches and kicks must be chosen depending on which part of the enemy&#x27;s body is exposed.

After defeating some enemies, Norris reaches a checkpoint and a split in the path, along with getting a new belt and an extra minute on the timer. At the next checkpoint, accessible after fighting more enemies and going further down the path, Norris unlocks a new attack that replaces the block and works against every enemy.

At the monastery, Norris fights multiple ninjas, who can turn invisible. The game ends when time runs out.

==Plot==
Chuck Norris must reach an ancient monastery to rescue a famous leader being held hostage. Dangerous warriors lie in waiting to stop him.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Games&quot; reviewed the Atari 2600 double cartridge with &quot;Artillery Duel&quot;: &quot;The game isn’t quite as boring as Artillery Duel, but it’s still far from exciting. Two games aren&#x27;t better than one if they’re both mediocre.&quot;&quot;Tilt&quot; reviewed the Atari 2600 version and gave the game a score of six out of six. &quot;&quot; gave the Atari 2600 version a score of four out six. &quot;AllGame&quot; reviewed the ColecoVision version and said that &quot;[o]verall, Chuck Norris Superkicks is an uneven and sometimes laughable gaming experience.&quot; &quot;Strana Igr&quot; ranked the game as the second best fighting game of 1983 behind &quot;The Attack of the Phantom Karate Devils&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, in a reader submitted column said: &quot;I&#x27;m sure there are folk out there – folk willing to put the time in – who really enjoy this game, but for me, it&#x27;s just not any fun.&quot;

<text>Dr. Seuss&#x27; Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler is a sliding puzzle video game developed by Coleco. It was first released for the ColecoVision in 1984 and was later ported to several home computers. The game features six Dr. Seuss characters: the Cat in the Hat, the Grinch, a Star-Bellied Sneetch, the Doorman, and the Woset and Clark. Designed for children ages 4–10, the objective of the game is to reassemble scrambled pictures, each of which is composed of three characters.

== Gameplay ==
There are five difficulty levels from which to choose. In the easiest level, players can mix and match the characters&#x27; heads, torsos and feet any way they like. In higher levels of play, there are more puzzle pieces, some of which are upside down, and characters must be assembled in their original left-to-right order. Puzzles range in size from 9 to 25 pieces. The fifth level has a time limit which, when beaten, will give the player bonus points.

The manual for &quot;Dr. Seuss&#x27; Fix-Up the Mix-Up Puzzler&quot; claims that the game promotes &quot;problem-solving strategies, logic, pattern recognition, memory and a variety of other early learning skills.&quot;

<text>The Keystone B-3A was a bomber aircraft developed for the United States Army Air Corps by Keystone Aircraft in the late 1920s.

==Design and development==
The B-3 was originally ordered as the LB-10A (a single-tail modification of the Keystone LB-6), but the Army dropped the &quot;LB-&quot; &#x27;light bomber&#x27; designation in 1930.

Although the performance of the B-3A was hardly better than that of the bombers flown at the end of World War I, it had come a long way in terms of flight safety.

==Operational history==
The B-3A was a member of the last family of biplanes operated by the US Army; it remained in service until 1940. A few years after it was first produced, the introduction of all-metal monoplanes rendered it almost completely obsolete.

==Variants==
;LB-10
:The last of the 17 LB-6s ordered (S/N 29-27) was converted with a re-designed single fin and rudder and two 525 hp Wright R-1750E engines. Delivered to Wright Field on 7 July 1929, it was wrecked on 12 November 1929.
;LB-10A
:This version used Pratt and Whitney R-1690-3 Hornet engines and was slightly smaller, in both wingspan and length. A total of 63 were ordered (S/N 30-281/343). All were re-designated as the B-3A before any deliveries were made, with the final 27 built as B-5A with Wright engines.
;B-3A
:Ordered as LB-10A, 36 delivered as B-3A (S/N 30-281/316). The first aircraft was delivered in October 1930.
;B-5A
:Ordered as B-3A, re-engined with Wright R-1750-3 Cyclone engines, 27 built (S/N 30-317/343).

<text>The Keystone B-4 was a biplane bomber, built by the Keystone Aircraft company for the United States Army Air Corps.

==Design and development==
Originally ordered by the United States Army Air Corps as the LB-13 light bomber. When the &quot;LB-&quot; designation was dropped in 1930, the first five planes were redesignated Y1B-4. (The &quot;Y1B-&quot; designation indicates that funds for the design did not come from the normal annual funds.)

The first B-3A (S/N 30-281) was converted to Y1B-4 configuration with the addition of R-1860-7 radial engines and low pressure tires. Because of more powerful engines, the performance of the Y1B-4 was a slight improvement on the B-3, but the only difference between the two planes was their engines. On April 28, 1931, the army ordered 25 improved Y1B-4s as the Keystone B-4A. This production version was part of the last biplane bomber order made by the Army Air Corps (along with 39 B-6As, identical in all respects except their make of engine), and the B-4As, delivered between January and April 1932, were the last biplane bombers delivered to the Air Corps.

==Operational history==
The B-4 was the last of the Keystone biplane bombers ordered by the U.S. Army in late 1931. These aircraft were used primarily as observation and reconnaissance aircraft as early as 1934 when the Martin B-10B went into operational service. Some remained in service into the early 1940s.

==Variants==
;LB-13
:Seven aircraft ordered but delivered as the Y1B-4 and Y1B-6 with different engine installations.
;Y1B-4
:Five pre-production aircraft, as the LB-10 but with two 575 hp (429 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1860-7 engines.
;B-4A
:Production version of the Y1B-4, 25 built.

<text>Rocky Super Action Boxing is the first licensed video game based on the &quot;Rocky&quot; franchise. The game is based on &quot;Rocky III&quot; and was designed by Coleco for its ColecoVision console. The player can play as either Rocky Balboa or Clubber Lang, either against the computer in a one player game, or against each other in a &quot;Head to Head&quot; two player mode. There is also a &quot;Demo&quot; mode if the player wants to watch Rocky and Clubber Lang fight.

==Gameplay==

Each boxing match consists of, according to the skill level chosen, two, five, ten, or fifteen rounds each lasting one minute each. During gameplay, the player&#x27;s movement is restricted to three positions or &quot;lanes&quot; vertically, and from each player&#x27;s side of the ring to the front of their opponent horizontally.

The 4 button controller allows for (independently) offensive hits to the body or head, defensive blocking for the head and body, and ducking.

Points are scored in the game by hitting the opponent&#x27;s guard (1 point), or with a punch connecting with the opponent&#x27;s head or body (2 points for either hit).

Victory can be achieved in two ways, either by knockout, or by point count if the fight goes all the way to the end.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
George Kopp of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot; said that &quot;Coleco&#x27;s &quot;Rocky&quot; for the Super Action Controllers is a masterpiece of sports simulation.&quot;

<doc id="869725" wikidata="Q1933704" url="?curid=869725" title="Wonderland (Erasure album)">
<text>Wonderland is the debut studio album by English synth-pop duo Erasure, released on 1 May 1986 by Sire Records in the United States and on 2 June 1986 by Mute Records in the United Kingdom and Germany. Not an immediate success, the three singles released from it failed to crack the top 40 in the UK. &quot;Who Needs Love Like That&quot; would eventually make the UK top 10 in 1992, and &quot;Oh l&#x27;amour&quot; reached the UK top 20 in 2003, both in remixed form promoting their &quot;Pop! The First 20 Hits&quot; and &quot;Hits!&quot; compilations respectively. However, the album fared better in both Germany and Sweden, where it charted within the top 20.

Erasure&#x27;s initial exposure in the US came via dance clubs, as two singles reached the top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

At the time of its release, &quot;Wonderland&quot; was considered a failure, especially when comparing it to Clarke&#x27;s prior successes with Depeche Mode and Yazoo. Andy Bell has stated that Alison Moyet was an influence of his vocals and he used to practice to Yazoo songs.

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Dance Trax&quot; column, Brian Chin wrote that &quot;Erasure&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; (Sire) may just be the nicest thing ever produced by Mute Records. &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Oh l&#x27;amour&quot; are pop-disco that would be hi-NRG if harder; other highlights on this enjoyable album are the shuffler &quot;Say What&quot; and &quot;Love is a Loser,&quot; as arch and ambiguous as any Boy George song.&quot;

== Track listing ==


===US release (Sire)===
The UK and US album versions of &quot;Oh l&#x27;amour&quot; were slightly different. The Brazilian edition of the album contains the live version of &quot;Oh l&#x27;amour&quot; as track 6. The US version drops the tracks &quot;Push Me Shove Me&quot; and &quot;Pistol&quot; and adds &quot;March on Down the Line&quot; which was originally the B-side to &quot;Oh l&#x27;amour&quot; in the UK (and also appeared in a remixed form as a CD bonus track on the UK version of the album). The CD versions of both the UK and US versions of the album have different remixes as bonus tracks.


===2011 remaster and repackage===
On 4 July 2011, EMI re-released Erasure&#x27;s first two albums in 2CD/DVD format. Both feature the original album remastered, plus another disc of tracks associated with the album, and a DVD containing promo videos and a live concert.

===2016 &quot;Erasure 30&quot; 30th Anniversary BMG Reissue LP===
Subsequent to their acquisition of Erasure&#x27;s back catalog, and in anticipation of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, BMG records commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007&#x27;s &quot;Light at the End of the World&quot;. All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gram vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.

===2016 &quot;30th Anniversary Edition&quot; US Audiophile Remaster LP===
In December 2016, American boutique record label Intervention Records released an audiophile-quality analogue remaster of the US release sourced from Sire&#x27;s masters still held by Warner Bros. Records in the US. The release was pressed on 180-gram vinyl and in a 60s-style Tip-On jacket.

Intervention also planned and begun work on a similar release of Erasure&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Circus&quot;, for the first quarter of 2017, but it was withdrawn in February of that year.

<doc id="869726" wikidata="Q598090" url="?curid=869726" title="Battle of Maloyaroslavets">
<text>The Battle of Maloyaroslavets took place on 24 October 1812 as part of the French invasion of Russia. It was Kutuzov&#x27;s decisive battle to force Napoleon to retreat northwest over Mozhaisk to Smolensk on the devastated route of his advance with a higher probability of starvation. Kutuzov&#x27;s next attack against the remnants of the , the Battle of Krasnoi, began on 15 November 1812, three weeks later.

==Prelude==
The last major battle had been the Battle of Tarutino on 18 October 1812, that was won by the Russian army.
A great part of the large mob of non-combatants, invalids from the hospitals, women, fugitive inhabitants of Moscow, whose number can only be guessed at, was directed upon Vereya and the straight road to Smolensk and only the fighting force was to march towards Kaluga.
On 19 October 1812, Napoleon had retreated from Moscow and marched south-west to Kaluga, Eugène de Beauharnais leading the advance
The French army leaving Moscow was estimated by Wilson: 90,000 effective infantry, 14,000 feeble cavalry, 12,000 armed men employed in the various services of artillery, engineers, gendarmerie, head-quarter staff, equipages, and commissariat, and more than 20,000 non-combatants, sick, and wounded.

Alexis Joseph Delzons commanded the lead units going to the village of Maloyaroslavets. The bridges across Luzha River were destroyed by order of local authorities. Delzons&#x27; soldiers entered the city over a dam and built a pontoon bridge next to the destroyed one. Then Delzons attacked the heights on which the village rested. On the evening of October 23 Delzons placed two of his battalions in the village.

==Battle==
On the 24 October 1812 General Dokhturov entered the town from the south and found the French spearhead had seized a bridgehead. Fierce fighting began. General Raevski arrived with 10,000 more Russians; once more they took the town, though not the bridgehead. De Beauharnais threw in his 15th (Italian) division, under Domenico Pino (Minister of War of the Kingdom of Italy), and by evening they had again expelled the Russians. Armand Charles Guilleminot was the first who entered the city. During the course of the engagement the town changed hands no fewer than eight times and it was quoted that in particular the Italian Royal Guard under Eugène de Beauharnais &#x27;had displayed qualities which entitled it evermore to take rank amongst the bravest troops of Europe&#x27;. Marshal Kutuzov arrived and decided against a pitched battle with the Grand Army the next day, and to retire instead to the prepared line of defense at Kaluga. The mainly French and Italian forces won a victory on the day, but Napoleon might have realized that &quot;unless with a new Borodino&quot; the way through Kaluga and Medyn was closed. This allowed Kutuzov to fulfill his strategic plans to force Napoleon on the way of retreat in the north, through Mozhaisk and Smolensk, the route of his advance that he had wished to avoid. French casualties were about 6,000–8,000, while the Russians lost about 8,000 men killed and wounded.

==Kutuzov&#x27;s strategy==
On the 25 October 1812 at about two in the morning after the battle Kutuzov retired his army in perfect order southwards away from the French army behind the rivulet of Koricza to secure the road to Kaluga. The British general Wilson who wanted Napoleon to be attacked protested against this strategy. Then according to the claim of the Wilson, Kutuzov replied to him, here simplified for a better understanding: &quot;I am by no means sure that the total destruction of the Emperor Napoleon and his army would be such a benefit to Russia; his succession would fall to the United Kingdom whose domination would then be intolerable.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The immediate result of the battle of Maloyaroslavets on the 24th had been a strange French tactical victory: the French army had secured a bridgehead, the Russian army had retreated but Napoleon did not follow them. The long-term result of the battle became a Russian strategic victory as they had disturbed Napoleon&#x27;s ability to wage a war.

On the 25th, at daybreak, Napoleon nearly was caught by a Cossack regiment but was saved by a corps of grenadiers.

From then on, Napoleon carried a bag containing a lethal poison, hung by a string around his neck.

On the 26th, Napoleon decided to retreat over Mozhaisk and Borodino to Smolensk for reasons unknown resulting in the strange detour in the attached map of Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia at Maloyaroslavets.

On the 26th Napoleon again set out for Maloyaroslavets...he ordered the retreat of his own army by Mozhaisk on Smolensk.
Before Napoleon could come to such a conclusion he must have been very conscious of the extreme weakness of his army, for the march he now decided on undertaking was one of two hundred and sixty miles through a devastated country, whose towns, sacked and burnt, offered no shelter or supply against the inclemency of winter.
On the night of October 27, the rear guard of the Grand Army left the ruins of the city, crossed to the northern bank of the Luzha and joined the general retreat.

On Kutuzov&#x27;s order, Platov and his Cossacks directly followed Napoleon. The next major battle for the Russian army was the Battle of Vyazma on 3 November 1812.

Kutuzov &quot;escorted&quot; Napoleon on the more southern roads with better supply of food and shelter, securing the south against the French army. The next battle for Kutuzov was the Battle of Krasnoi on 15 November 1812.

The last battle in this campaign for Napoleon was the Battle of Berezina on 26–29 November 1812.

<doc id="869730" wikidata="Q839669" url="?curid=869730" title="Patrice Lumumba Peoples' Friendship University of Russia">
<text>The Patrice Lumumba Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia (Russian: Российский университет дружбы народов имени Патриса Лумумбы), also known as RUDN University and until 1992 and after March 2023, as Patrice Lumumba University in honour of the Congolese politician Patrice Lumumba, is a public research university located in Moscow, Russia. It was established in 1960 by a resolution from the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR to help nations to assist countries that had recently achieved independence from colonial powers. The university also acted to further Soviet foreign policy goals in nonaligned countries.

The university focused on catering to non-aligned countries, which were previously known as the &quot;Third World&quot;. The university&#x27;s main goal was to train personnel from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. RUDN University was considered the &#x27;Oxford&#x27; of Russia in the mid-1980s due to the fame it achieved within a short period. RUDN University&#x27;s stance on global issues became neutral after the end of the Cold War with the collapse of the Soviet Union. RUDN University mainly focuses on research and has partnerships with over 2500 foreign universities and research centres. 

In March 2023, the name of Patrice Lumumba was returned to the RUDN University.

Rector signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
===1960-89 ===
The university was founded on 5 February 1960. Its stated purpose was to help developing nations. Many students from developed countries also attended the university. On 22 February 1961, the university was named Patrice Lumumba University after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba, who had been killed in a coup that January. The stated purpose for establishing the university was to give young people from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially from low-income families, an opportunity to be educated and to become qualified specialists. The organizations mentioned as founders of the university are the All-Union Central Soviet of Trade Unions, the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, and the Soviet Associations Union of Friendship and Intercultural Relationship.

Sergey Vasilievich Rumiantsev, Doctor of Engineering, was the university&#x27;s first Rector. He remained its Rector until 1970. In 1960, Russian language studies for international students started at the preparatory Faculty. On 1 September, Russian language studies were introduced at the six main faculties of the PFU (Engineering faculty, Faculty of History and Philology, Medical Faculty, Agricultural Faculty, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Law and Economics). The first 288 students from 47 countries graduated in 1965. Around that time, international construction teams started to appear, and the first student teams of KVN were organized.

Vladimir Frantsevich Stanis became the second Rector of the PFU. He proclaimed the &quot;cult of knowledge&quot; at the university, heading it from 1970 to 1993. In 1972, Stanis proceeded to extend the duration of studies, which until then were shorter, along the lines of mainstream Soviet universities. At the Faculty of Medicine, for instance, the duration of studies was extended from five to six years. By 1975, the university had more than 5,600 graduates, 4,250 people from 89 foreign countries.

===1990-2019 ===

The university&#x27;s name was changed to the Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia on 5 February 1992 by the RF Government, the university&#x27;s founder. The university&#x27;s current Russian name is &quot;Российский университет дружбы народов&quot; which could be translated as &quot;The Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia&quot; or, more directly, as &quot;Russian University of the Friendship of Nations&quot;. The English-language version of the university&#x27;s website, however, uses the name &quot;RUDN University&quot;, with the acronym RUDN derived from the Russian name transliterated into English (&quot;Rossiiskii Universitet Druzhby Narodov&quot;). Nonetheless, it remains most common in English to use the name &quot;Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia&quot; or the abbreviation &quot;PFUR&quot;.

From 1993 to 1998, PFUR was headed by Vladimir Filippov, a 1973 graduate of Patrice Lumumba PFU. From 1998 to 2005, PFUR was directed by Dmitry Petrovich Bilibin, a graduate of Patrice Lumumba PFU. He was acting Rector until 2004 and was elected Rector of the university in 2004. Filippov was reelected Rector of the PFUR on 4 March 2005 and has headed the university since then. The 1990s saw the creation of new faculties and Institutes: the Ecological faculty, the Faculty of Economics, the faculty of Law, the Philological faculty, the faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the faculty of Refresher Training for Health Care Professionals, the Institute of Foreign Languages, the Institute of Distance Learning, the Institute of Hospitality Business and Tourism, and the Institute of Gravitation and Cosmology. 

More than 77,000 graduates work in 170 countries, among them more than 5,500 holders of PhD and Doctorate degrees. Lecturers train specialists in 62 majors and lines of study. More than 29,000 graduate and postgraduate students from 140 countries studied at the university as of 2014. They represented more than 150 nations of the world. It has a team of 4,500 employees, among them 2,826 teachers. Foreign and Russian political and public figures, scholars, and scientists have become PFUR Emeritus Professors.

===2020-present===
The university and 11 others from Russia were suspended from the European University Association (EUA) following support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by its president Vladimir Mikhailovich Filippov in a statement issued by the Russian Union of Rectors (RUR) in March 2022. The EUA justified the suspension on the support expressed in the statement, stating said universities were &quot;opposed to the European values that they committed to when joining EUA&quot;. In early March 2022, open letters were published calling for an end to the war in Ukraine on behalf of employees, students, and graduates of several Russian universities, including the Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia.

==Ranking==
The university was ranked #1,035 worldwide by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and #1,635 by the Center for World University Rankings in 2022.

<text>James W. Kemp (born c. 1955; died September 7, 2006) was a United Methodist pastor and author from Lexington, Kentucky. He is best known for his book &quot;The Gospel According to Dr. Seuss&quot;.

==Education and career==
Kemp grew up in Lexington and attended Duke Divinity School. He served as a minister for 15 years before retiring in 1996 due to multiple sclerosis. He became paraplegic, and his speech declined to the point where his mother took dictation for his books, and his wife interpreted for him during interviews.

==Writing==
His first book was &quot;Who Says I&#x27;m Dead?&quot; and details his struggles with multiple sclerosis, particularly an incident in 2000 when the federal government mistakenly believed he had died. The second was a book of ideas for children&#x27;s sermons.

While serving as a minister he had often used Seuss stories as illustrations for his sermons, and those sermons were the inspiration for his third book, &quot;The Gospel According to Dr. Seuss&quot;. He said Theodor S. Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss) had always been his favorite theologian, and his favorite theological book was &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg.&quot;

The &quot;short, clever new book&quot; has 13 chapters about characters like Sam I Am, Yertle the Turtle, King Derwin of Didd, and the Grinch. In each chapter he summarizes a Seuss story, draws a moral from it, and links the story to Biblical passages or characters.

The book was released in January 2004; by March a second printing had been ordered, and Barnes &amp; Noble featured it as part of a national celebration of Geisel&#x27;s birthday.

==Death==
He died September 7, 2006, after living with multiple sclerosis for 20 years. Just before his death he told his family and friends that he wanted them to &quot;put the fun back into funeral&quot; for his memorial service.
