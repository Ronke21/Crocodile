<text>Pete Shelley (born Peter Campbell McNeish; 17 April 1955 – 6 December 2018) was an English singer, songwriter and guitarist. He formed early punk band Buzzcocks with Howard Devoto in 1976, and became the lead singer and guitarist in 1977 when Devoto left. The group released their biggest hit &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot; in 1978. The band broke up in 1981 and reformed at the end of the decade. Shelley also had a solo career; his song &quot;Homosapien&quot; charted in Australasia and Canada in 1981 and 1982.

==Biography==
Shelley was born to Margaret and John McNeish in Leigh, Lancashire. His mother was an ex-mill worker in the town and his father was a fitter at Astley Green Colliery. He had a younger brother, Gary. Shelley&#x27;s stage name is inspired by Percy Bysshe Shelley, his favourite poet.

===Buzzcocks===
Shelley formed Buzzcocks with Howard Devoto after they met at the Bolton Institute of Technology (now the University of Bolton) in 1975 and subsequently travelled to High Wycombe, near London, to see the Sex Pistols. The band included bass guitarist Steve Diggle and drummer John Maher; they made their first appearance in 1976 in Manchester, opening for the Sex Pistols.

In 1977 Buzzcocks released their first EP, &quot;Spiral Scratch&quot;, on their independent label, New Hormones. When Devoto left the band in February 1977, Shelley took over as the lead vocalist and chief songwriter. Working with the producer Martin Rushent, the band created the punk/new wave singles &quot;Orgasm Addict&quot;, &quot;What Do I Get?&quot; and &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot;, along with three LPs: &quot;Another Music in a Different Kitchen&quot; (1978), &quot;Love Bites&quot; (1978) and &quot;A Different Kind of Tension&quot; (1979). Difficulties with their record company and a dispute with Virgin Publishing over the UK release of their greatest hits record, &quot;Singles Going Steady&quot;, brought the band to a halt in 1981.

Shelley developed a different personal image from many of his rebellious 1970s punk contemporaries, telling &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1978, &quot;I won&#x27;t be nasty. We&#x27;re just four nice lads, the kind of people you could take home to your parents.&quot;

===Solo career===
Shelley&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Sky Yen&quot; was recorded in 1974, but remained unheard until it was released on 12&quot; vinyl on Shelley&#x27;s own label, Groovy Records, in March 1980. It was recorded as a continuous piece of music using a purpose-built oscillator, and used layered electronics and playback speed manipulation to achieve its experimental feel. Rooted in electronic music, it has been compared with krautrock. Also released on Groovy Records was the soundtrack LP &quot;Hangahar&quot; by Sally Timms and Lindsay Lee, which included Shelley as a musician, and an album by artists Eric Random, Barry Adamson and Francis Cookson under the name &quot;Free Agents&quot;. Groovy Records did not release any other records.

Shortly after the success of &quot;Ever Fallen In Love...&quot;, Shelley produced an EP by Manchester band Mellatron, including Dave Tucker and Karl Burns, both at various times members of The Fall, but it was never released, after the record label&#x27;s owner was arrested and the master tapes disappeared.

In 1981, Shelley released his first solo single, &quot;Homosapien&quot;, produced by Rushent. On this recording he returned to his original interests in electronic music and shifted emphasis from guitar to synthesiser; Rushent&#x27;s elaborate drum machine and synthesiser programming laid the groundwork for his next production, the chart-topping album &quot;Dare&quot; by the Human League. &quot;Homosapien&quot; was banned by the BBC for &quot;explicit reference to gay sex&quot;. &quot;Homosapien&quot; peaked at number fourteen in the US dance chart. Shelley talked openly about his bisexuality at this time, which had been implicit in many of the songs he had written, but now came to wider attention due to &quot;Homosapien&quot; and the BBC ban. The single was followed by an LP of the same title.

Shelley released his second LP &quot;XL1&quot; in 1983 on Genetic Records. As well as the minor hit &quot;Telephone Operator&quot;, the album included a computer program for the ZX Spectrum with lyrics and graphics that displayed in time to the music. &quot;XL1&quot; was produced by Rushent and Shelley.

In mid-1984, Shelley released the single &quot;Never Again&quot;, followed by the album &quot;Heaven and the Sea&quot; in 1986. In 1987, he followed the album with a new song, &quot;Do Anything&quot;, for the film &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;. He composed the theme music for the intro of the Tour de France on Channel 4, which was used from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.

Shelley recorded a new version of &quot;Homosapien&quot;, called &quot;Homosapien II&quot;, in 1989. The single featured four mixes of the new recording. He played with various other musicians during his career, including the Invisible Girls who backed punk poet John Cooper Clarke. Shelley also formed a short-lived band called the Tiller Boys. He briefly reunited with Howard Devoto to make the LP &quot;Buzzkunst&quot;, released in 2002. Shelley appeared on the 2005 debut EP by the Los Angeles band the Adored, who toured with Buzzcocks the following year.

===Buzzcocks reform===
Buzzcocks reunited in 1989 and released a new full-length album, &quot;Trade Test Transmissions&quot;, in 1993. They continued to tour and record and released the album &quot;The Way&quot; in 2014. In 2005 Shelley re-recorded &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot; with an all-star group, including Roger Daltrey, David Gilmour, Peter Hook, Elton John, Robert Plant and several contemporary bands, as a tribute to John Peel; proceeds went to Amnesty International. Shelley performed the song live at the 2005 UK Music Hall of Fame.

==Personal life and death==
Shelley was married to Miniko in 1991 and divorced in 2002. Their son Alex was born in 1993. He then moved to Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012 after marrying Greta, an Estonian, preferring the less-hectic pace there to London where he had lived for nearly 30 years. He died there of a suspected heart attack on the morning of 6 December 2018. His brother, Gary McNeish, announced his death on Facebook.

Tributes to Shelley came from a diverse range of music industry professionals, including Pearl Jam, Duff McKagan, Pixies, Billy Talent, Peter Hook, Duran Duran, Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Joyce, Noel Gallagher, Gary Kemp, Flea, Mike Mills, Ginger Wildheart, Glen Matlock and Stuart Braithwaite. Musician Billy Bragg paid tribute to Shelley, covering Buzzcocks&#x27;, &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot;, on 7 December 2018 at the Meredith Music Festival.

Following his death, the Pete Shelley Memorial campaign was established in order to raise funds to create a lasting memorial in his hometown for his achievements and contributions to the music industry.

<text>In Polynesian mythology, Tuna is a god of eels. In Hawaiian mythology he fights with Māui, who is having an affair with his wife Hina. Māui kills him, cuts off his head, and plants it near his home. A green shoot emerges from the spot where the head was buried, and grows into the first coconut palm. In the mythology of Mangaia Tuna is the lover of Hine, and asks that his head be cut off and planted in order to stop a flood. A coconut shoot grows from the head. A variant of the story is told in the Samoan myth of Sina and the Eel.

===Final===

The final was played on 25 January 1997 at the Arms Park in Cardiff. The match was contested by Brive of France and Leicester of England. Brive won the match 28–9; they took the lead early on through a fourth-minute penalty from Christophe Lamaison, and Sébastien Viars extended that lead with an unconverted try two minutes later. Leicester responded with three penalties from John Liley, but Brive finally made their pressure show with three second-half tries, one of which was converted, before Lamaison added a drop goal to seal a 19-point victory.

<doc id="849460" wikidata="Q2535955" url="?curid=849460" title="Rick Jones (character)">
<text>Rick Jones is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as a sidekick and friend to the Hulk, Captain America, Mar-Vell / Captain Marvel, Rom the Spaceknight, and Genis-Vell / Captain Marvel.

The character has been an active participant in many significant Marvel storylines, including the Kree–Skrull War and the Destiny War. Rick has acquired superpowers on numerous occasions, with one seeing him become a Hulk-like creature called A-Bomb.

Rick Jones has been adapted into various media outside comics, primarily in association with the Hulk. Seth Green and Luke Perry, among others, have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==

Rick Jones was created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in &quot;Hulk&quot; #1 (May 1962).

==Fictional character biography==
Rick Jones was born in Scarsdale, Arizona. He lost his parents at a young age and grew up in an orphanage. Later, he accepted a dare to drive out to a bomb testing ground in New Mexico. As luck would have it, the gamma bomb designed by Bruce Banner was being tested. Banner pushed Rick into a protective trench, saving his life, but absorbing the gamma rays that transform Banner into the Hulk. Rick thus became the sole confidant of the Hulk&#x27;s identity.

=== Early days with the Hulk and the Avengers ===
Jones&#x27; guilt over causing the incident (and lack of any other place to go) led him to stay close to Banner and the Hulk. In one story, he even gained mental control over Hulk. Eventually, the dangerous unpredictability of Hulk forced Rick to keep his distance.

Later, Rick formed the Teen Brigade, a loose network of teenagers with ham radios throughout the United States. The first Teen Brigade played a role in the origin of the Avengers when the Norse god Loki tampered with the Teen Brigade&#x27;s radio transmission. Originally, the Teen Brigade intended to bring the Fantastic Four together to battle the Hulk, but instead brought Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Thor together to form the Avengers.

After the Hulk&#x27;s departure from the team, Rick became an honorary Avenger. He alerted the team to the Hulk&#x27;s presence when they began searching for him. He became close to the recently revived Captain America although his guilt led him to leave the Avengers and seek out Banner and Hulk on his own.

Captain America rescued Rick from one of Hulk&#x27;s rampages, and after that Rick became Captain America&#x27;s sidekick, briefly taking the title and uniform of Bucky Barnes, Captain America&#x27;s long-dead junior partner. This was on Jones&#x27; own insistence, over Captain America&#x27;s guilty objections, noting that others have also lost partners and that it was time to move on. Rick&#x27;s brief time as Bucky gave him the training to survive around superheroes to this day.

When Rick believed Hulk to be dead (although Hulk had actually been sent to the future), he revealed the truth of Banner&#x27;s condition to Col. Glenn Talbot, thus inadvertently making Banner a wanted fugitive by the US Military.

===Captain Mar-Vell===
After being neglected by Captain America, Rick became fed up with the Captain&#x27;s ego. After talking with Edwin Jarvis, Rick decided to leave the Avengers for good. Rick joined with the Kree Captain Mar-Vell when he finds himself drawn to the mystical Nega-Bands. Donning the Bands, he is immediately linked to Captain Marvel. Once joined, one of the two remains in a protective bubble in the Negative Zone. After either the person not in the Negative Zone strikes the Nega-Bands together or a certain amount of time passes, the two switch places. Rick and Mar-Vell go on various adventures encountering many different heroes, such as the Hulk, Namor, and Captain America.

Rick and Mar-Vell play a critical part in the Kree–Skrull War. Rick is freed from the Negative Zone through a portal in the Fantastic Four headquarters. Mar-Vell is released from the Negative Zone while Rick is still in the regular world without the use of the Nega-Bands. The bond between the two is broken. At the height of the conflict, the Kree Supreme Intelligence briefly unleashes the Destiny Force from within Rick. Rick uses his new-found ability to summon images of various Golden Age heroes. While at full power, Rick single-handedly stops both the Kree and Skrull fleets long enough to put an end to the conflict. Injuries that Rick sustains lead Mar-Vell to willingly bond with Rick to save his life. Shortly after this the Captain Marvel series was re-launched and we found that Rick was not able to contain the energy of Mar-Vell. He was then bombarded with photonic energy, which saved him and enabled him to contain Mar-Vell safely. A consequence of this was that Mar-Vell gained the ability to absorb energy in addition to the nega-band energies to boost his strength and could fly using photonic energy.

Rick and Mar-Vell serve as a duo for several years while Rick pursues his musical career and love life. Eventually, the two are again freed from their bond while aiding the Avengers against the Super-Adaptoid. Rick then parts company with Mar-Vell. Rick begins to spend his time with the Hulk again and briefly forms a new Teen Brigade, after which Rick finds himself again teamed with Mar-Vell, though not merged with him as they deal with Thanos. Sometime after, Mar-Vell dies of cancer that he received when he was exposed to a deadly nerve gas stolen by the villain Nitro.

===Venturing with Rom===
After Mar-Vell&#x27;s death, Rick began to team with the Hulk again. Guilt over causing Banner to be hit with the gamma rays made Rick decide to expose himself to gamma rays in an attempt to become another Hulk-like being that could stop the Hulk. However this plan backfired and Rick was dying of gamma poisoning until Banner cured him. However, this too led to the consequence of Rick developing a form of blood cancer.

Rick was going to undergo a massive blood transfusion to treat this ailment when the hospital was attacked by monsters created by the Dire Wraiths. Rick was saved by the Spaceknight Rom and began to team with Rom despite the fact that Rick was slowly dying. Upon the final defeat of the Wraiths, Rom banished them all to Limbo and then bade farewell to Rick and Earth. Shortly after Rom left, Rick met the alien Beyonder, who cured his cancer.

===Reunion with the Hulk===
Shortly after the encounter with the Beyonder, Rick once again teamed with the Hulk. This time, the Hulk had been split into two beings, Banner and Hulk, but the experiment was a failure and both were dying. Thunderbolt Ross tried to stop the process of remerging the two, and Rick intervened only to be dumped into the chemical nutrient bath that was fusing Banner and the Hulk again, transforming into a Hulk-like creature.

With the Vision&#x27;s help, Banner and the Hulk are reunited, but, both are weak and still dying. As a result of a nutrient nath developed by Doc Samson, Banner/Hulk is reverted from Green Hulk into the Grey Hulk. During this time, Rick as Hulk battled the Grey Hulk, Zzzax, the Hulkbusters, and the Outcasts. The Grey Hulk is manipulated by Samuel Sterns, along with Banner, into siphoning the radiation from Rick into Sterns. Sterns is then turned back into the Leader, drastically altering his appearance, and Rick is cured of his Hulk transformations.

Rick stays with Banner, the Grey Hulk, Betty Ross, and Clay Quartermain for several months as they travel the country looking for a government supply of gamma bombs. The group splits after the Hulk&#x27;s apparent death at the Leader&#x27;s hands. Rick&#x27;s psionic potential is later released by Moondragon against Atlantean invaders.

Rick authors the book &quot;Sidekick&quot;, an autobiography of his time with super-heroes. While on a book tour, he meets Marlo Chandler without realizing that she had only recently broken up with the Hulk (then acting as a Las Vegas thug with the alias Mr. Fixit). Rick is kidnapped by a Skrull vessel and the Hulk aids in Rick&#x27;s rescue. This starts another period with Rick and the Hulk, this time with Marlo and Betty.

===Encounters with death===
Rick came in touch with death in several ways during this time with the Hulk. First, Rick dies at the hands of Thanos, along with half of the universe, when Thanos uses the Infinity Gauntlet to impress Death. Rick and the others are brought back in ensuing events.

Rick assisted the Hulk many times during his tenure with the Pantheon. During this time, he guns down an insane killer, but is still wracked with remorse. Over time he bonds with Wolfsbane of X-Factor, who also killed another insane murderer during the same debacle; he even ends up inviting her to his wedding.

Another major encounter with death occurs when Jackie Shorr (who is revealed to be a demented serial killer) comes into his life and claims to be his mother. This claim has not been proven, but she insists that those she killed and left mummified in her basement were substitutes for Rick, and that he is her real son. Shorr is discovered to be insane, but not until after she kills Marlo by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. A horrified Rick refuses Reed Richards&#x27;s offer to carry out a DNA test, saying that he does not want to know, especially if she is truly his mother.

Rick attempts to bring Marlo back using a resurrection device known as the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; that the Leader developed, but the Hulk, believing that the Leader&#x27;s efforts are part of a bigger villainous plan, destroys the equipment partway through the process. Marlo is left in a catatonic state. Rick&#x27;s care eventually helps Marlo return to full health despite the intervention of many other well-meaning friends and family, including Marlo&#x27;s brothers and Captain America.

Shortly after Marlo is revived, the two become engaged and quickly marry. Neither of them realizes, however, that a portion of Death remains &quot;in&quot; Marlo. This piece of Death attracted many strange visitors to the wedding, including Mephisto and Death herself.

The married couple soon finds success in a popular talk show, &quot;Keeping Up with the Joneses&quot;, but it is cut short when Rick is crippled by a Banner-less Hulk, who made a deal to work for Apocalypse and become his Horseman &quot;War&quot; if he removed the shrapnel from the Hulk&#x27;s brain. The injury confines Rick to a wheelchair and the debilitation strains his relationship with Marlo. The strain increases following Betty Ross&#x27; death, with the couple splitting shortly thereafter.

Rick joins Banner again after he returns to Earth and merges with the separated Hulk. His serious health problems force him to be brought by the Avengers to the now-captive Supreme Intelligence for aid, which marks the beginning of the Destiny War, as Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s rejection of his apparent destiny to become Immortus results in Rick&#x27;s access to the mysterious &#x27;Destiny Force&#x27; being used to draw in a team of seven Avengers from different points in time to act as his protectors. Over the course of these events, Rick&#x27;s injury is healed when he is able to channel the Destiny Force into himself, and after the final battle with the powerful Time Keepers, he is joined with Genis-Vell (the new Captain Marvel and son of Mar-Vell), due to a temporal paradox involving the future Genis-Vell linking with Rick to save his life.

===Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell)===
Rick&#x27;s bond with Genis works in about the same way as his bond with Mar-Vell. The biggest difference is that the two switch in and out of the Microverse rather than the Negative Zone. Genis-Vell&#x27;s unique birth and accelerated aging makes him the opposite of Rick: full of power but without experience. They compensate for each other&#x27;s weaknesses with Rick taking on the role of mentor. He helped Genis learn to control his cosmic awareness and accept his role as a superhero. As Rick&#x27;s confidence grew, he also attempted to rekindle his romance with Marlo.

It was not until this point that Marlo&#x27;s connection with Death is finally revealed. Thanos aids in separating the two, but Rick is prematurely aged and loses an arm in the process. He is later yanked back in time to the Destiny War, where he aids his younger self in the conflict leading to his bond with Genis.

Marlo tries to aid the elderly Rick the way he had helped her when she was catatonic. Rick&#x27;s pride, however, just causes more problems. The Supreme Intelligence attempts and fails to restore Rick to his normal condition, but he is spontaneously restored to his normal age and health shortly thereafter. Rick believes this was divine aid while Genis believes it was a delayed reaction to the Supreme Intelligence&#x27;s procedure. No definitive explanation has yet been determined.

For a while, Rick and Genis are yanked back and forth through time. Rick encounters two older versions of himself: one an aging collector surviving under the rule of the Maestro; the other a super-villain named Thanatos. The super-villain Rick was in the process of creating the &quot;ultimate Rick Jones&quot;. He is stopped by the elder Rick&#x27;s ability to wield Thor&#x27;s hammer, Rick having been judged worthy for things the present Rick had yet to do and things that Thanatos would never achieve.

Rick and Marlo again split when Marlo becomes romantically involved with Moondragon. Shortly after, Genis goes insane when his cosmic awareness reaches its peak. Rick&#x27;s attempts to continue as Genis&#x27; guide are fairly unsuccessful. Genis becomes a callous, homicidal maniac believing himself a god. Rick&#x27;s friend even destroys the universe just to rebuild it with Rick and Genis as sole survivors.

In the rebuilt reality, Genis again loses his mind. Rick develops an ability to mentally attack Genis through their psychic bond (although the pain is reciprocal). For a time, Genis uses this same link to control Rick. He goes as far as &#x27;convincing&#x27; Rick to kill himself on a whim. Genis brings Rick right back to life just as easily.

In part due to Rick&#x27;s influence, Genis&#x27; madness calmed to a point where he was able to maintain a veneer of sanity, albeit with some unpredictability. He creates a recording studio for Rick that allows for fame and fortune at the sake of Internet-based sales of a song written for Marlo. The same song also acts as a catalyst for the two to reunite, with Marlo ending her relationship with Moondragon.

At the end of the series, it is revealed that Rick has a &quot;comic awareness&quot; that the &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; comic series was coming to an end. He pushed for several of the loose ends of the series to be resolved: Rick and Genis were separated again, and Rick was reunited with Marlo.

===&quot;Runaways&quot;===
Rick was revealed to be the mysterious benefactor of Excelsior. The group is composed of former teenage superheroes dedicated to reforming other super-powered kids from following down the same path. Their first targets are the Runaways patrolling Los Angeles in the wake of the supervillain power vacuum since the defeat of the Runaways&#x27; evil parents, the Pride, who once controlled the city. Rick tells Excelsior that he wanted the Runaways back in foster care because he did not want them to go through the same experiences he went through.

Rick served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America following his death.

===&quot;World War Hulk&quot;===
Rick re-connects with the Hulk during the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; mini-series. He seeks out the Hulk and attempts to talk him down, telling his friend that, while he recognized that the Illuminati had been out of line in their decision to exile him to Sakaar and their apparent involvement with the deaths of thousands of innocent people on that planet, including the Hulk&#x27;s wife and unborn child, his current blind quest for vengeance was not him, using Hulk&#x27;s willingness to protect innocent people caught in the fight between him and a Zom-possessed Doctor Strange as proof that the Hulk was still a hero rather than a man blindly seeking vengeance. After the Hulk&#x27;s climactic battle with the Sentry resulted in him reverting to Bruce Banner, one of the Hulk&#x27;s associates, Miek impales Rick through the chest to provoke Banner into turning back into the Hulk. Rick is seen being loaded into an ambulance.

===Becoming A-Bomb===

In the aftermath of &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, the Intelligencia transform Rick Jones into a blue Hulk-like creature called A-Bomb. He is later depowered by Doc Green, a new personality of Bruce Banner who believes gamma-powered superhumans to be a threat to humanity.

===Working as Whisperer===
As a side effect of losing his Hulk abilities, Rick briefly gains the ability to learn any task at lightning speed. He uses this ability to become a master hacktivist known as the Whisperer during the &quot;&quot; storyline and secretly aids the new Captain America. He uncovers a plot by Maria Hill called Project Kobik, which uses shattered Cosmic Cube remains to create a new cube. Phil Coulson&#x27;s group learns about Pleasant Hill and Rick&#x27;s involvement. Deathlok, Daisy Johnson, and Jemma Simmons investigated Rick&#x27;s house and discovered a hidden escape route. They follow Rick through the Morlock Tunnels and apprehend him. During an interrogation at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Battlecarrier, the New Avengers arrived to retrieve Jones from S.H.I.E.L.D. It turns out that the New Avengers were contacted by Rick through a pre-recorded video that was to be sent to them in the event that the alien nanobots he ingested noticed him being unconscious. The New Avengers invading the S.H.I.E.L.D. Battlecarrier to retrieve Jones prompts The Pentagon into retaliating by unleashing the American Kaiju on the New Avengers. In the aftermath of the events that transpired at Pleasant Hill, Steve Rogers offers Rick the chance to join S.H.I.E.L.D. as part of his reparations for his hacktivism.

In the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Rick entrusts Rayshaun Lucas with data to prove the innocence of Captain America, who the Red Skull brainwashed into becoming a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America later executes Rick by firing squad.

In &quot;The Immortal Hulk&quot;, a group of scientists retrieve Rick&#x27;s corpse and revive him as an Abomination/A-Bomb-like creature called &quot;Subject B&quot; before he is eventually returned to normal.

==Powers and abilities==
Rick Jones is an athletic man who previously had no powers. He received special training in combat and gymnastics by Captain America, making him a highly skilled martial artist. Rick is also a self-taught folk/rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer, guitarist, and harmonica player.

One time, Rick wielded the Destiny Force: a powerful ability utilized during the Kree–Skrull War storyline. Focusing this power allowed him to perform amazing feats, such as summoning various members of the Avengers from past, present and future. Although, its generally random unless another controlling influence, Libra is assisting him.

Rick&#x27;s latent psionic potential had been once unleashed by the Kree Supreme Intelligence, but he is unable to utilize it at will. He was also able to shift dimensional positions with Mar-Vell, and later Genis-Vell for a time.

After being kidnapped and experimented on by the Intelligencia, Rick gains the ability to transform into a blue-skinned creature resembling the Abomination. He is later depowered after the Hulk drains his gamma radiation, but gains the ability to learn information rapidly, making him an expert in computer hacking.

As Subject B, Rick has superhuman strength, enhanced durability, regeneration, claws, and the ability to generate corrosive acid. After being returned to normal, he gains the ability to fly and generate gamma energy.

<text>Lunatic Harness is the fourth studio album by English electronic music producer Mike Paradinas under the stage name μ-Ziq. It was released on 30 June 1997 in the United Kingdom on the Planet Mu label, and on 29 July 1997 in the United States on the Astralwerks label. It was rereleased with bonus tracks from the &quot;My Little Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Brace Yourself&quot; singles in 2022 for its 25th anniversary.

==Critical reception==

A retrospective Apple Music editorial review describes &quot;Lunatic Harness&quot; as &quot;the prettiest album to come out of the mid-&#x27;90s &#x27;drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass&#x27; movement&quot;, noting that Paradinas eschewed the abrasiveness of similar works by Squarepusher and Aphex Twin in favor of &quot;atmospheres of ethereal color and shimmering melody&quot;, bringing the album &quot;closer to pop music than anything Paradinas had previously attempted&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Lunatic Harness&quot; one of the 20 best Astralwerks albums. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 27 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>William Frederick Meggers (July 13, 1888 – November 19, 1966) was an American physicist specialising in spectroscopy.

Born in Clintonville, Wisconsin, he had to combine his early schooling with working on the family farm, but earned a scholarship to Ripon College, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1910 and working as a research assistant. After a few years at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1914 he joined the National Bureau of Standards, and while working there earned his PhD from Johns Hopkins University.

His work in spectrochemistry is generally credited to have sparked interest in the field in the United States, leading to him being dubbed &quot;the Dean of American spectroscopists&quot;.

In 1947 he received the Frederic Ives Medal and the C.E.K. Mees Medal in 1964, both from the Optical Society. In 1958, OSA named him an Honorary Member. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1953. Since 1970, the Optical Society of America has awarded the William F. Meggers Award for outstanding work in spectroscopy.

In 1965, Dr. Meggers and his wife, Edith R. Meggers, donated their coin and stamp collections to the American Institute of Physics, for the express purpose of establishing a biennial award program for the improvement of physics teaching at the high school level. Awards have been presented since 1994.

The Meggers crater on the Moon is named in his honor.

His daughter and oldest child was Betty J. Meggers, who also received her doctorate and became a noted archeologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, specializing in South American pre-Columbian archeology. He also had two sons, William F. Meggers Jr. (1924-2000) and John C. Meggers (1928-1966).

There are two awards named in his honor: The Optical Society&#x27;s William F. Meggers Award and the Applied Spectroscopy William F. Meggers Award.

<text>Lobelioideae is a subfamily of the plant family Campanulaceae. It contains 32 genera, totalling about 1200 species. Some of the larger genera are &quot;Lobelia&quot;, &quot;Siphocampylus&quot;, &quot;Centropogon&quot;, &quot;Burmeistera&quot; and &quot;Cyanea&quot;.

They are perennials, sometimes annuals, ranging in form from herbs to small trees. Most species are tropical in distribution, but in total this subfamily occurs almost worldwide, being absent only from Arctic regions, central Asia and the Near East. The subfamily is particularly diverse in Hawaii, where well over 100 species of Hawaiian lobelioids have radiated from a single introduction. 

This subfamily was formerly given family rank as Lobeliaceae, under a somewhat different circumscription.

The leaves are simple and alternate. The plants have milky sap. The flowers are bilaterally symmetric with five lobes and stamens. The corolla tube opens along the upper side with two lobes above and three below, and the stamens join together in the tube.

<text>WebGUI is an open-source content management system written in Perl and released under the GNU General Public License.

The system permits non-technically minded users to arrange content in pages and layouts, containing &#x27;Assets&#x27; (applets) which permit website visitors to view and interact with various types of data from basic Articles to full-blown content management system and custom applications.

In July 2014, Scott Walters proposed a project on Kickstarter to bring the nascent Version 8 rewrite to a formal release with a supporting free software community. Version 8 is, according to the Kickstarter project page, &quot;a massive modernization effort that reworked core to use Moose, Plack, Try::Tiny&quot; along with a general code cleanup. The project achieved its crowd funding goal on July 16, 2014.

==Introduction==
WebGUI (pronounced web-GOO-E) is a system that gives web administrators the ability to manage the appearance and features available in the user interface to fit each user&#x27;s skill level. Its users and groups system allows control over content editing and viewing privileges, and the versioning and workflow systems allow for content approval hierarchies and tracking of content as it moves through the site. Everything in WebGUI is a template which allows for customization, while keeping the site content and style separate.

The system was originally built as an application framework by creator Plain Black Corporation to support their customer development work, but a majority of its current independent users utilize it as a CMS with the modules with which it ships.

==History==
In 1999 a development project called Web Done Right began in an effort to create a web application framework. Over the next several years, Web Done Right evolved and eventually became WebGUI. WebGUI and its parent company Plain Black Corporation were launched to the public in 2001.

==Features==
The WebGUI software can be used for:
*Web-based Administrative Interface
*WYSIWYG Rich Text Editor
*Workflow Engine
*Versioning
*E-Commerce
*User Management
*Group Management
*Search engine friendly URLs
*Internationalization

==Architecture==
WebGUI is built as an application framework, and has a pluggable architecture to aid in the extensibility of applications. Developers can create custom applications and functionality that match an organization&#x27;s processes. A pluggable macro architecture allows for even more extensibility and flexibility. WebGUI&#x27;s modular design allows code to be easily accessed, changed, and replaced.

WebGUI is a mod_perl application but there is a project codenamed PlebGUI to port WebGUI to PSGI, the Perl Web Server Gateway Interface, which enables deployment using CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, et al.

==Built in applications==
With WebGUI, users can create:
* Online shops that accept credit cards.
* Forums (Flat, Nested, and Threaded views)
* SQL Reports (Drill down and hierarchical queries enabled)
* Polls
* Classifieds
* Web Log (blogs)
* Photo Galleries
* News Listings
* FAQs
* Link Directories
* Job Postings
* User Contributions
* Syndicated News (includes aggregation)
* Events Calendars
* Surveys
* Self-Grading Tests
* Articles
* Search Engines
* Web Services Front End
* Matrix Comparison Systems
* Weather Data
* Stock Data
* Dashboard (My Page)
* In/out Boards
* Project Management
* Time Tracking
In addition, there are many user contributed applications available.

==Themes==
WebGUI comes with a number of built in themes, and additional themes are freely available in the add-ons section of the WebGUI website. Everything in WebGUI is a template, and templates are accessed through the admin user interface.

==Translation==
WebGUI has a translation server that allows anyone to contribute translated terms for any field label in the user interface. These translations can then be applied to a site and users can manage content in their native languages. WebGUI contains Dutch, German, English and Spanish translations.

==Licensing==
WebGUI is licensed under GNU General Public License, which means it is free to download and use.

==System requirements==
* Application Server: mod_perl
* Database: MySQL
* Operating system: Any
* Programming language: Perl
* Root Access: Yes
* Shell Access: Yes
* Web Server: Apache

===WebGUI runtime environment===
To ease the installation of WebGUI&#x27;s requirements, Plain Black distributes them inside of the WebGUI Runtime Environment (WRE). The WRE includes everything needed to run WebGUI, excepting some Perl modules that versions of WebGUI released after the WRE may require. The WRE is pre-compiled by Plain Black for their list of supported systems, and members of the community submit WRE binaries for other systems.

In addition to the requirements, the WRE includes tools to administer WebGUI servers. The 0.8 version of the WRE introduced the WRE Console, which is a GUI tool (viewed with a web browser) to set up and manage WebGUI sites.

==Mascot==

Gooey, the purple octopus is the mascot of WebGUI. It was created by Darci Gibson.

==Reception==
A 2019 review by staff at Business.com noted WebGUI&#x27;s collaboration features and community support as among its useful features, and ability to customize each user&#x27;s interface depending on their skill level.

<doc id="849472" wikidata="Q17144142" url="?curid=849472" title="Push (professional wrestling)">
<text>In professional wrestling, a push is an attempt by the booker to make a wrestler win more matches and become more popular or more reviled with the fans depending on whether they are a heroic character (&quot;face&quot;) or a villain (&quot;heel&quot;). It is not uncommon for a push to be accompanied by a turn or a change in the wrestler&#x27;s gimmick. This is essentially the opposite of a burial, which in contrast to the high profile of a push is typically done with little or no fanfare. Sometimes the fans generate the push for a wrestler themselves when their approval for the wrestler&#x27;s work generates a positive reaction from them that is not anticipated.

==History==
In the Memphis territory, Nick Gulas began to push his son George to a main event spot despite having little in-ring experience and no athletic background. The fans quickly turned on him and the promotion, but Nick Gulas continued to push him despite the negative backlash and financial losses. In the end, Nick&#x27;s insistence on keeping his son at the top of the card led to a hostile split of the territory.

A push can also be attributed to a political shift in the promotion&#x27;s offices. Cowboy Bill Watts, whose promotions always consisted of an African-American main event heroic character, began pushing Ron Simmons, a midcarder, to main event status and eventually to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship upon being put in charge of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at the same time he controversially pushed his son Erik into the wrestling scene.

In WWE, following the fallout from the Signature Pharmacy scandal, smaller and less muscular wrestlers such as CM Punk and Jeff Hardy began to get pushed and Vince McMahon confirmed the paradigm shift by mentioning that today&#x27;s fans are drawn by charisma and not size.

In WWE, when the company was being built around fan favorite John Cena, shedding his edgy, freestyle rapping anti-establishment persona which was popular in favor of a more motivational &quot;against all odds&quot; one, was met with a negative reaction by the fans to the point where he became one of the most booed wrestlers in the promotion.

<text>Royal Astronomy is the fifth studio album by English electronic music producer Mike Paradinas under the stage name μ-Ziq, released on 26 July 1999 by Hut Records and Astralwerks.

==Critical reception==

Jon Dolan of &quot;Spin&quot; described &quot;Royal Astronomy&quot; as Paradinas&#x27; &quot;most ambitious work to date: a bold stab at classicism steeped in lush orchestrations that can be anything from sweetly elegiac to darkly bizarre—as if the embattled soul conducting the musicians is being torn between millennial nightmares and wistful visions of empires past.&quot; Sarah Zupko of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it &quot;the most advanced and adventurous work of his career.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Royal Astronomy&quot; the 38th best album of 1999.

<doc id="849476" wikidata="Q1596011" url="?curid=849476" title="1995–96 Heineken Cup">
<text>The 1995–96 Heineken Cup was the first edition of the Heineken Cup, which was to become the annual rugby union European club competition for clubs from the top six nations in European rugby. Competing teams, from France, Ireland, Italy, Wales and, for the only time to date, Romania (teams from England and Scotland were not permitted to enter the competition by the RFU and SRU respectively), were divided into four pools of three, in which teams played each other only once, meaning one home and one away game per team. The winners of the pools qualified for the knock-out stages.

==Background==
The Five Nations Committee met in December 1994 to discuss proposals for a multi-national European club competition. It was proposed that the top four teams in Wales, England, France, Ireland and Scotland would compete. Welsh, English and French clubs had welcomed the idea, but the RFU were concerned that it might devalue the Courage League. In May 1995, the Committee gave the go-ahead for a pilot European Cup tournament to be held in the autumn of 1995, and a full competition to follow in 1996. Clubs from England, Wales, France and provincial or divisional sides from Ireland and Scotland, and possibly the top club from Romania, would be invited to compete.

However, English and Scottish teams would be unable to participate as it was too late to change their domestic league schedules to accommodate the new competition. The IRFU confirmed that Ireland would enter provincial teams, as their clubs were unlikely to be strong enough for the competition. They were initially offered two places, but Tom Kiernan, Ireland&#x27;s representative on the organising committee, was able to secure a third. The three places would go to the top three teams in the 1994 IRFU Interprovincial Championship, Munster, Ulster and Leinster. The three Welsh teams would be the top two in the Welsh Premier Division, Cardiff and Pontypridd, and the winners of the WRU Challenge Cup, Swansea. France entered the top two teams in the 1994-95 French championship, Toulouse and Castres, and cup runners-up Bègles-Bordeaux.

In October, ITV secured the UK TV rights for the competition in a three-year deal, and Dutch brewing company Heineken was announced as the competition&#x27;s sponsor.

==Teams==
==Pool stage==
The twelve teams were arranged into four pools of three, with each team playing the other team in their pool once. Two points were awarded for a win, and one point for a draw. The four pool winners qualified for the knockout stage.

===Final===

The 1996 Heineken Cup Final was the final match of the 1995–96 Heineken Cup, the inaugural season of Europe&#x27;s top club rugby union competition. The match was played on 6 January 1996 at the Arms Park in Cardiff. The match was contested by Cardiff of Wales and Toulouse of France. Toulouse won the match 21–18 after extra time; they took the lead with two tries in the first 10 minutes, but the kicking of Adrian Davies kept Cardiff level. With the scores at 15–12 as the clock ticked past 80 minutes, Davies stepped up again and slotted over a penalty to take the game to extra time. Christophe Deylaud restored Toulouse&#x27;s lead with another penalty shortly after the game restarted, before Davies tied the scores up again. Then, going into the final few seconds of extra time, the referee penalised Cardiff for using hands in the ruck; Deylaud slotted the resulting penalty to seal Toulouse&#x27;s victory.

<text>Bilious Paths is the sixth studio album by the British IDM producer μ-Ziq, released on Planet Mu in 2003.

==Critical reception==
John Bush of &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave the album 4 stars out of 5, writing, &quot;Highlights abound, but this is definitely one for those used to the blend of heavy innovation and occasional inanity to be found on nearly every μ-Ziq record.&quot; Matt Gonzales of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Bilious Paths&quot; is further proof that μ-Ziq is an indisputable giant in the IDM world, even if few people can see him.&quot;

<text>Triple J Unearthed is an Australian digital radio station and online music discovery platform. It is a sister station of Triple J, owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Unearthed began in 1995 as a regional talent competition open to unsigned musicians. In 2006, the Unearthed website was launched as a way for local artists to have their music heard by the station&#x27;s team and listeners. As of 2023, the platform hosts over 170,000 tracks from over 85,000 independent musicians. Its success led to the launch of a dedicated digital radio station in 2011, which only plays Australian music uploaded to the site.

Cited as a &quot;revolutionary idea&quot; that &quot;arguably changed the entire Australian music landscape,&quot; the Unearthed brand has been responsible for discovering some of Australia&#x27;s most celebrated musical acts, including Flume, Missy Higgins, Vance Joy, Gang of Youths and Grinspoon. The network continues to host initiatives to progress independent artists in the industry, including Unearthed High, an annual award given to high school musicians to have their work recorded professionally.

== Formats ==

=== Talent competition (1995–2005) ===

In July 1995, Triple J launched its regional Unearthed competition, asking independent musicians to send in their demos. The winner&#x27;s track would be professionally recorded and played on the station. Over the years, several now-notable Australian artists had been discovered through the initiative, including Missy Higgins (2001), Killing Heidi (1996) and Grinspoon, the first winners in 1995. As of 2006, Triple J had travelled to over 43 regions around Australia and &quot;unearthed&quot; over 100 bands, most of which had gone on to independently release albums and score distribution deals.

=== Website (2006–present) ===
In 2006, former Triple J manager Linda Bracken ideated an online platform that would allow unsigned musicians to be heard by the station&#x27;s team, as well as by listeners. She was inspired by the similar New Music Canada initiative by CBC Radio 3.

With funding from the Australia Council for the Arts, Bracken and software engineer Ann Chesterman – who saw the idea as &quot;being at the heart of the ecosystem of Australian music&quot; – built a prototype for the Unearthed website. The site&#x27;s launch, on 9 August 2006, marked &quot;a new beginning&quot; for the Unearthed brand. Thousands of tracks were uploaded within the first week of the site being online. By 2010, about 100 songs were being uploaded onto the Unearthed website every day. As of 2023, it hosts over 170,000 tracks from over 85,000 independent musicians.

In 2021, the website received its first major redesign since its initial launch.

On 18 December 2024, the New South Wales Police Force alleged that two men used the Unearthed website– particularly its profile customisation features, like writing a user bio– to recruit a Goulburn Correctional Centre inmate to carry out a stabbing on gang leader Bassam Hamzy in February that year. The ABC, which owns Triple J, did not comment on the matter.

=== Digital radio station (2011–present) ===
Seeing the success of the website, Unearthed executive producer Stephanie Carrick and ABC Music director Chris Scaddan ideated with creating a dedicated digital radio station to accompany the online platform. It was launched on 5 October 2011, on digital radio in the five major Australian capital cities, and via the Unearthed website.

== Initiatives ==

=== Unearthed High ===

Every year since 2008, Triple J Unearthed has held a competition aimed at musicians and bands in high school. The winner receives mentoring, recording opportunities and airplay on Triple J. Recent acts to have found success with the initiative include Hockey Dad (2014), The Kid Laroi (2018), Genesis Owusu (2015) Japanese Wallpaper (2014) and Gretta Ray (2016).

Celebrating 15 years of the competition in 2023, Triple J held a one-night, all-ages concert during Vivid Sydney featuring notable past entrants, including Lastlings and Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers.
=== Indigenous opportunities ===

As an extension of Unearthed High, the Indigenous Initiative commemorates the best First Nations artist. Notable past winners have included Aodhan (2019), Becca Hatch (2017) and Tia Gostelow (2016). The network also holds an annual competition open to Indigenous Australian artists, with the winner selected to play at the National Indigenous Music Awards. Past winners have included Thelma Plum, Baker Boy, Alice Skye and Dallas Woods. Unearthed has also run a number of First Nations specific competitions that has seen artists added to festivals such as First &amp; Forever and Treaty Day Out.

=== Festival lineup additions ===
Triple J often holds competitions that see a winning Unearthed artist join a major music festival&#x27;s lineup. In the past, winners have performed at Splendour in the Grass, Groovin&#x27; the Moo, Falls Festival, Big Day Out, Laneway Festival and A More Perfect Union.

=== Artist collaboration competitions ===
Unearthed occasionally run competitions where winning artists can work with renowned producers or songwriters. In 2023, Flume released a half-finished track, and Unearthed artists were encouraged to share how they would complete the song to win – the final track, produced by Blacktown rapper Isaac Puerile, received national airplay. The same year, Unearthed artists were given the opportunity to work with award-winning songwriter Sarah Aarons.

In the past, these competitions have also seen entrants remix songs from Lorde and DMA&#x27;s, as well as creating &quot;DIY supergroups&quot; out of samples from notable artists provided by Triple J.

=== COVID-19 grants ===
In June 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Unearthed handed out 16 grants to artists on the platform valued at $7,000 each, to record new music, produce music videos and promote their work.

== Impact ==
Writing for online magazine &quot;Tone Deaf&quot; in 2022, Holley Gawne wrote Triple J has been &quot;so successful ... in boosting the profiles of some of the industry’s biggest and brightest.&quot; Triple J music director Ruby Howe said Unearthed &quot;was a pretty revolutionary idea.&quot;

=== Notable alumni ===

In its first form as a regional talent competition, Unearthed discovered then-local musicians Missy Higgins and Sophie Koh, and bands Grinspoon, Killing Heidi and Sick Puppies.

The launch of the website led to the rise of hundreds of more artists and according to &quot;The Music,&quot; &quot;arguably changed the entire Australian music landscape.&quot; Flume, one of the &quot;world&#x27;s most prominent producers&quot; according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, debuted with a single on Unearthed titled &quot;Possum&quot; in 2011. Brisbane indie pop band Ball Park Music began uploading to the site in 2008, while Gang of Youths uploaded a demo as well as their debut single &quot;Evangelists&quot; in 2013.

When a then-unsigned Vance Joy uploaded &quot;Riptide&quot; to the platform, Howe said his team played the track &quot;about 100 times on Unearthed radio&quot; prior to its enormous success – the track is now certified 16× platinum and ended up polling at number one in the Hottest 100 of 2013.

<doc id="849486" wikidata="Q1423726" url="?curid=849486" title="Pillsbury (brand)">
<text>The Pillsbury Company was a US-based company that was one of the world&#x27;s largest cake manufacturers and producers of grain and other foodstuffs until it was bought by General Mills in 2001. Antitrust law required General Mills to sell off some of the products, so the company kept the rights to refrigerated and frozen Pillsbury branded products, while dry baking products and frosting were sold to the Orrville, Ohio–based Smucker company under license. Brynwood Partners agreed to purchase Pillsbury&#x27;s dry baking and frosting assets from Smuckers for 375 million in July 2018. In September 2018, the sale was completed along with other brands including Martha White and Hungry Jack.

== History ==

=== Founding and early development ===

C.A. Pillsbury and Company was founded in 1869 by Charles Alfred Pillsbury and his uncle John S. Pillsbury. The company was second in the United States (after Washburn-Crosby) to use steel rollers for processing grain. The finished product required transportation, so the Pillsburys assisted in funding railroad development in Minnesota.

In 1889, Pillsbury and its five mills on the banks of the Mississippi River were purchased by a British company. The company also tried to purchase and merge with the Washburn Crosby Company (a precursor of General Mills), but the principals at Washburn prevented the takeover.

In 1923, the Pillsbury family reacquired &quot;Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company, Limited&quot; which subsequently was incorporated in 1935 as &quot;Pillsbury Flour Mills Company&quot;.

=== 1950s ===

In 1949, the company introduced a national baking competition, which came to be known as the Pillsbury Bake-Off; it was nationally broadcast on CBS for many years and resulted in a series of successful cookbooks that helped market Pillsbury brands.

Only seven products used the Pillsbury name in 1950, but the company began adding to its product line. The early 1950s brought the acquisition of Ballard &amp; Ballard Company and the beginning of packaged biscuit dough, which would become one of the company&#x27;s most important and profitable product lines in later decades. The company began advertising heavily on television. In 1957, Pillsbury commissioned a TV commercial jingle (from its advertising agency Leo Burnett) with the main lyrics &quot;Nothin&#x27; says lovin/Like somethin&#x27; from the oven/And Pillsbury says it best&quot;. The jingle became a well-known signature of the company and was used, with modifications, for at least 20 years.

Later corporate acquisitions included restaurants such as Burger King, Steak and Ale, Bennigan&#x27;s, Godfather&#x27;s Pizza, Häagen-Dazs, and Quik Wok, plus popular grocery store food brands such as Green Giant.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
Advertising company Leo Burnett created Pillsbury&#x27;s Doughboy in 1965. 

In the 1960s, Pillsbury added Sweet* 10 made with cyclamate, which became the most popular artificial sweetener. In 1964, Pillsbury introduced Funny Face Drink Mix with the names Goofy Grape, Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Raspberry, Freckle Face Strawberry, Loud Mouth Lime, Chinese Cherry (later Choo-Choo Cherry), and Injun Orange (later Jolly Olly Orange). Lefty Lemon followed in 1965, along with other flavors. The Funny Face characters, as well as the Funny Face brand were created in 1963 by Hal Silverman, a Creative Director at Campbell Mithun Advertising. When cyclamate was banned, Sweet* 10 and Funny Face were eliminated, resulting in a $4.5 million loss. Both products were re-introduced after changes, and the drinks became available sweetened and unsweetened.

Another drink mix introduced in 1966 was Moo Juice, a flavored powder that when combined with milk in a shaker, produced a milkshake. Moo Juice was also created by Hal Silverman. Its TV commercial featured a talking animation of the product&#x27;s cartoon cow head mascot voiced by comedian Frank Fontaine. Moo Juice was short-lived, as its milkshakes tended to be thin compared to similar products such as Borden&#x27;s Frosted and Birds Eye&#x27;s Thick and Frosty.

Among the other kid foods that Silverman created for Pillsbury was Nugget Town, chocolate flavored nuggets that came in eight different, collectable packages that when popped open and folded made into a whole western town. The TV commercial featured comedian Buddy Hackett as the voice of the town&#x27;s little bear sheriff. Also, there was Gorilla Milk—&quot;...you&#x27;ll go ape for Gorilla Milk, a glass in the morning and you&#x27;ll swing all day&quot;—a protein additive that turned milk into an instant breakfast. This product, aimed at teenagers, was not successful going against Carnation Instant Breakfast.

That decade, Pillsbury also created Space Food Sticks to capitalize on the popularity of the space program. Space Food Sticks were developed by Robert Muller, the inventor of the HACCP standards used by the food industry to ensure food safety.

When NASA astronaut Scott Carpenter launched into space on Mercury capsule Aurora 7 in 1962, he was carrying with him the first solid space food small food cubes developed by Pillsbury&#x27;s research and development department. Taking Pillsbury scientists more than a year to develop, space food cubes were followed by other space-friendly foods, such as cake that was not crumbly, relish that could be served in slices and meat that needed no refrigeration.

Pillsbury acquired the Burger King fast food chain in 1967. Pillsbury bought out Green Giant in 1979.

=== 1980s and after ===
The Pillsbury Company bought Häagen-Dazs in 1983. Then in 1985, Pillsbury acquired Diversifoods, the largest Burger King franchisee in the U.S. and parent company of Godfather&#x27;s Pizza. In 1988, Pillsbury sold the Godfather&#x27;s Pizza chain to a management-led group as part of the company&#x27;s restructuring moves.

In 1989, the British company Grand Metropolitan (later Diageo) purchased the food maker, and during this ownership period the company divested itself of all production and distribution facilities (contracting these functions to other companies), making itself simply a marketing entity for its own brands (Pillsbury, Green Giant, Old El Paso, Totino&#x27;s, etc.) Pillsbury sold all of their restaurant brands and exited the business completely by the late 1990s. In 1999, Pillsbury and Nestlé merged their U.S. and Canadian ice cream operations into a joint venture called Ice Cream Partners.

In 2001 Nestlé exercised its contractual right to buy General Mills&#x27; interest in Ice Cream Partners, which included the right to a 99-year license for the Häagen-Dazs brand. Pursuant to that license, the Dreyer&#x27;s subsidiary of Nestlé produced and marketed Häagen-Dazs products in the United States and Canada.

In 2001, Diageo sold Pillsbury to General Mills. The baking products division was sold to International Multifoods Corporation, which was later acquired by Smucker&#x27;s.

== Notable achievements ==

Pillsbury once claimed to have the largest grain mill in the world at the Pillsbury A-Mill overlooking Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. The building had two of the most powerful direct-drive waterwheels ever built, each putting out 1200 horsepower (900 kW). The Pillsbury A-Mill was converted to artist lofts by the Dominium company in 2016.

In 1960, Robert J. Keith, then Vice President of Pillsbury, published an article titled the &quot;Marketing Revolution&quot; in the leading marketing journal, &quot;Journal of Marketing.&quot; The article, which was based on Keith&#x27;s personal recollections, set out the way that the Pillsbury Company had evolved. He pointed out that the company had shifted from a focus on production in the 1860s to sales focus in the 1930s through to a consumer focus in the 1950s. The characteristics of these three distinct eras in Pillsbury&#x27;s evolution include: the &quot;production oriented era&quot; from 1869-1930s – characterized by a &quot;focus on production processes&quot;; the &quot;sales oriented era&quot; from the 1930s to the 1950s – characterized by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits and the &quot;marketing oriented era&quot; from the beginning of the 1950s – characterized by a focus on the customer&#x27;s latent and existing needs.

In addition, Keith hypothesized that a &quot;marketing control era&quot; was about to emerge. Although Keith&#x27;s article explicitly documented Pillsbury&#x27;s evolution, the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at Pillsbury constitute a normal evolutionary path (production→sales→marketing) for most large organizations. Marketing scholars quickly picked up on Keith&#x27;s evolutionary stages for marketing organizations and it was integrated into marketing texts and became &quot;&#x27;accepted wisdom.&quot; One content analysis of 25 introductory and advanced texts found that Keith&#x27;s eras were reproduced in all but four.

Keith&#x27;s notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticized described as &quot;hopelessly flawed&quot;. Specific criticisms of Keith&#x27;s tripartite periodization include that:
* It ignores historical facts about business conditions
* It mis-states the nature of supply and demand
* It cites the growth of marketing institutions

Systematic studies carried out since Keith&#x27;s work have failed to replicate his periodization. Instead, other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the 19th century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before Pillsbury adopted a marketing-oriented approach. Jones and Richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the so-called production era and concluded that there was no &quot;marketing revolution&quot;. Keith&#x27;s eras have become known, somewhat cynically, as the &quot;standard chronology&quot;. In spite of such criticisms, Keith&#x27;s descriptions of the different eras continue to influence marketing thought.

<doc id="849491" wikidata="Q3268872" url="?curid=849491" title="Yangge">
<text>Yangge () is a form of Chinese folk dance developed from a dance known in the Song dynasty as Village Music (). It is very popular in northern China and is one of the most representative form of folk arts. It is popular in both the countryside and cities in northern China. It is especially popular among older people. Crowds of people will go out into the street in the evening and dance together in a line or a circle formation.

Some dancers dress up in red, green, or other colorful costumes, and typically use a red silk ribbon around the waist. They will swing their bodies to music played by drum, trumpet, and gong. More people will join in as they see Yang Ge going on and dance along. Some dancers use props like the waistdrum, dancing fan, fake donkey, or litter. In different areas Yangge is performed in different styles, but all types express happiness.

In the 1940s, the Chinese Communist Party launched the new &quot;yangge&quot; movement where the dance was adopted as a means of rallying village support. The dance was simplified into a pattern of three-quick-steps forward, one-step-backward, pause and repeat. This version of the dance incorporated socialist elements, for example the leader of the dance group would hold a sickle instead of umbrella, and it is also known as &quot;Struggle Yangge&quot; () or &quot;reform yangge&quot;.

==Types==
There are two major types of yangge, one is Stilt Yangge which is performed on stilts, the other is Ground Yangge which is more common and is performed without stilts. Another version of the yangge is the village play, an anthology of which was published by Sidney D. Gamble in 1970, based on transcriptions made by Li Jinghan as part of the Ding Xian Experiment&#x27;s surveys in the 1930s.

The Yangge drama or Yangge opera () usually consists of a quatrain of seven stanzas or long and short sentences. An example is the founding piece of the China National Opera when it was founded in Yan&#x27;an in 1942, which was with a performance of a Yangge drama Brothers and Sisters Opening up the Wasteland (). The Yangko owed something to normal spoken drama (&quot;huaju&quot;), but with dance, and songs added.

== Struggle (Reform) Yangge and the Chinese Communist Party ==

The new struggle yangge had roots in the traditional folk rite yangge that was performed in the rural parts of Northern China prior to the Japanese invasion of 1937. The folk rite was performative and was often associated with New Year’s celebrations, incorporating spirited dance, garish costumes, and loud music. The dance troupe was led by a leader dancer known as &quot;santou&quot; (umbrella head) and consisted of dancers, ranging from a few dozen to more than one hundred dancers. Simple plays were enacted during the dance, mostly about everyday life in rural China. The songs that accompanied the folk rite were conversations between young men and women about love or congratulatory greetings, and the swinging movements of the dances were generally sexually suggestive.

The struggle yangge that was popularized by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in urban settings from 1949 to 1951 was a political instrument used to communicate the socialist ideals of the CCP to the people. In fact, the dance limited artistic freedom and improvisation with specific guidelines that the dance must adhere to including: prohibition of male performers to dress as women; elimination of any flirtatious or erotic moves; forbiddened the portrayal of ghosts, deities, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests (elements that were common in rural yangge); no vulgarity or negative portrayals of the working class in the dances, and dancers were not permitted to wear excessive makeup. The power of the struggle yangge came from the dance’s simplicity and visibility, aimed at reaching a larger and wider audience. Unlike rural yangge with its complex and vast dance patterns, struggle yangge utilized simpler dance moves such as Double Cabbage Heart (spiraling move) and Dragon Waves Its Tail (snakelike movement) to, as one yangge dancer puts it, “to express an exuberant mood and to invite as many people as possible to share in the joy”.

Struggle yangge’s purpose was to tell a story about the success of the CCP developments, of how the Communists came to power, about the valor and strength of the People’s Liberation Army, the undying support of the Chinese people, the righteous leadership of the CCP, and the bright socialist future of China. The story was told in three musical performances, consisting of song and dance, with the production of these performances in chronological order to achieve maximum impact. The first was &quot;The Great Yangge of the Celebration of Liberation&quot; (庆祝解放大秧歌), which told the war of liberation from the Nationalists. The second piece was &quot;The Great Musical of Long Live the People’s Victory&quot; (人民胜利万岁大歌舞), which illustrated the remembrance of the people’s victory in the revolution. The last musical was &quot;The Great Yangge of Building the Motherland&quot; (建设祖国大秧歌), which depicts the construction of a new socialist country under the leadership of the CCP. The production of each performance was elaborate and complex, with shows lasting four to five hours.

==Regional variations==

===North Shaanxi===
The dance may be in large groups of a dozen to a hundred people, or in two or three-person groups. The dancers move from location to location, visiting different parts of the town. The leader of the procession of dancers is called the &quot;santou&quot; or &quot;Umbrella&quot; who wields an umbrella to lead the movement of the group. He also sings, usually improvised, while the others will repeat his last line. Various characters may appear in the procession, such as the two comic characters Big-Headed Monk and Liu Cui (), and the Eight Immortals. The procession first follows the &quot;santou&quot; in a single file to form a large simple circle, and later then forms other more intricate patterns.

===Shandong===
The Shandong yangge is thought to be the purest forms of yangge. There are three major types of yangge in the Shandong province, the Haiyang yangge, Jiaozhou yangge, and the &quot;guzi&quot; ( &quot;drum&quot;) yangge. In &quot;guzi&quot; yangge each dancer takes one of five roles - &quot;Umbrella&quot;, &quot;Drum&quot;, &quot;Stick&quot;, &quot;Flower&quot;, &quot;Clown&quot; - the first three are named after the props the dancer holds, while the fourth refers to a female dancer.

===Liaoning===
In Liaoning and Beijing, a popular form is the stilt yangge where the dancers perform on stilts. There are many types of stilt yangge, for example &quot;Jietang&quot; is a group dance performed in the street; &quot;Jiaxiang&quot; involves the formation of a pyramid of different poses; &quot;Dachang&quot; is group dance done in a large open air space; and &quot;Xiaochang&quot; characterized by its love-story plot.

===Northeast China===
The performers of Manchurian Yangge in Northeast China usually wear traditional Manchu clothes of the area. The movement is free and brisk, imitating the valor of a tribe excelling in horsemanship and marksmanship.

<text>Trent Bridge Cricket Ground is a cricket ground mostly used for Test, One-Day International and county cricket located in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, just across the River Trent from the city of Nottingham. Trent Bridge is also the headquarters of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. As well as international cricket and Nottinghamshire&#x27;s home games, the ground has hosted the Finals Day of the Twenty20 Cup twice and will host the final of the One-Day Cup between 2020 and 2024.

In 2009, the ground was used for the ICC World Twenty20 and hosted the semi-final between South Africa and Pakistan. The site takes its name from the nearby main bridge over the Trent and it is also close to Meadow Lane and the City Ground, the football stadiums of Notts County and Nottingham Forest respectively.

==History==

Trent Bridge was first used as a cricket ground in the 1830s. The first recorded cricket match was held on an area of ground behind the Trent Bridge Inn in 1838. Trent Bridge hosted its first Test match in 1899, with England playing against Australia.

The ground was first opened in 1841 by William Clarke, husband of the proprietress of the Trent Bridge Inn and himself captain of William Clarke&#x27;s All-England Eleven. He was commemorated in 1990 by the opening of the new William Clarke Stand, which incorporates the Rushcliffe Suite.

In 1950, an electronically operated scoreboard was installed at this venue, then the world&#x27;s largest at any cricket stadium.

==Ground==

Trent Bridge is considered to be one of the most beautiful grounds in world cricket. Trent Bridge&#x27;s pavilion, kept within the architectural parameters of its 1889 foundation, is thought of as one of the most renowned trademarks of cricket because it faces the wicket at an angle. Recent developments include the £7.2 million Radcliffe Road Cricket Centre, opened in 1998 and the state of the art £1.9 million Fox Road stand, which has received awards for its architectural excellence. The latter includes a modernistic aircraft-wing roof and was opened in 2002 despite a conflict with a small group of local residents over the lack of sunlight that this would cause to their properties.

Commencing in 2007, Trent Bridge has undergone redevelopment with the construction of a new stand to replace the Parr Stand and West Wing and the addition of one to five rows of extra seating at the front of several of the other stands. This increased capacity from 15,358 to 17,500, and the work was completed in time for the 2008 Test match against New Zealand. The stand was officially opened on 5 June by Prince Philip. The stand continued to be officially called the &#x27;New Stand&#x27; for a number of years, also being referred to as the Bridgford Road Stand, before being renamed the Smith Cooper Stand in a sponsorship deal from March 2016.

Bowling takes place from the Stuart Broad End (named the Pavilion End until September 2023 with the official renaming on 18 July 2024) and the Radcliffe Road End, with the wickets laid square of the Fox Road, William Clarke and Smith Cooper Stands.

==Football==

Trent Bridge has a history of hosting football matches. Notts County Football Club played their important games at the ground from the 1860s, and moved there permanently in 1883 when Nottingham Forest left. However, games early and late in the season had to be played elsewhere due to the cricket and Notts County finally left in 1910, moving to Meadow Lane.

Trent Bridge also hosted an international match, England beating Ireland 6–0 on 20 February 1897.

<doc id="849501" wikidata="Q5384765" url="?curid=849501" title="Errenzhuan">
<text>Errenzhuan (, lit. &quot;two-people rotation&quot;) is a genre of musical theater and folk dance from Northeast China, usually involving two performers (one male and one female). The dance uses folding fans or square-shaped red handkerchiefs, which are twirled as the songs are performed. It is popular due to its comedic dialogue and sketches, which have obfuscated the old dances and songs. 

&quot;Errenzhuan&quot; was previously called a &quot;double play&quot;. It may consist of half-class opera, small &quot;yangko&quot;, &quot;fengliu&quot;, Spring Song, double side songs, bouncing, or Northeastern local opera written by the people of Northeast China. This form of performance emerged at the beginning of the 21st century as a folk art of Northeast China. Errenzhuan means ‘two people’ (&quot;erren&quot;) ‘telling stories through performing different roles’ (&quot;zhuan&quot;).

&quot;Errenzhuan&quot; is one of the particular forms of Chinese walking-singing, which was famous in many northern Chinese provinces, such as Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and northeast Hebei. It is also referred to by the locals as the &quot;Northeast-featured Errenzhuan&quot;, and has more than 300 years of history since its creation. Years of development have cultivated a variety of performances, divided into four factions: Eastern School, Western School, Southern School, and Northern School. Each faction has its own unique characteristics. At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, the four major factions emerged separately from the countryside and spread to the rest of China.

Popular routines include &quot;Fowling&quot;, &quot;Selling Thread&quot;, &quot;Reward for Detective Dee&#x27;s Deeds&quot;, &quot;Ancient City&quot;, &quot;Blue Bridge Tryst&quot;, &quot;Romance of the West Chamber&quot;, &quot;At Ba Bridge&quot;, &quot;Shuangsuo Mountain&quot;, &quot;Huarong Pass&quot;, &quot;Palace&quot;, &quot;Baohao&quot;, &quot;Panda&quot;, &quot;Chanyu Temple&quot;, and &quot;Spring Trip of Miss Yang the Eighth.&quot;

The performance of the duo is different from most Chinese dramas (such as those done by the Peking Opera). &quot;Errenzhuan&quot; is closely related to the common people (a &quot;grassroots&quot; style), and the content of the performance is closely related to the lives of the people in the northeastern region of the country. &quot;Errenzhuan&quot; started as a performance used by farmers during the off-season. As it became gradually accepted by the public, it developed into a professional form of entertainment.

==Development history==
&quot;Errenzhuan&quot; originates in the three provinces of Northeast China: Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. It is a form of &quot;quyi&quot; (&quot;melodious art&quot;) storytelling by performers through singing and dancing. Bengbeng has been around for over 200 years. The script is written in language that is easy to understand by every day people, humorous, rich in local lifestyle, flavorful, and includes vocal music based on the northeastern folk songs. &quot;Errenzhuan&quot; formed in the Northeast is influenced by rural characteristics of the region&#x27;s inhabitants, often including some inappropriate and bitter content. The main content of performances is generally very orthodox, such as &quot;comment on the northeast drum&quot;, &quot;comment on opera conten&quot;, or &quot;lotus flower&quot;. Before the Jilin Folk Art Troupe (the former Jilin Provincial Opera Second Troupe) was established in 1980, the two performers used these kinds of performance.

After the establishment of the art troupe, it reorganized and regulated the content of the &quot;errenzhuan&quot;, and many areas became popular, in a type called &quot;errendou&quot;. Some of the better-known works include &quot;Horse Before Water&quot;, &quot;Roast Duck&quot;, &quot;Eight Arches of Pigs&quot;, &quot;Drunken Sky&quot;, &quot;Monkey Wukong three-tone Banana Leaf Fan&quot;, &quot;Blessing of Love Downhill&quot;, &quot;Western View Painting&quot;, &quot;Two Mothers&quot;, &quot;Visit the sick&quot;, &quot;Bao Gong Breaks the Empress Dowager&quot;, and &quot;Blue Bridge.

The earliest record of the name Erren Zhuan comes from the &quot;Taidong Daily&quot; (published in Kangde, Manchuria) on April 27, 1934. According to the article, people are often invited to perform a duet in a teahouse in the city. These actors were called &quot;lotuses&quot; and they performed in various roles in different operas.

At the First National Folk Music and Dance Congress (held in Beijing in April 1953), &quot;errenzhuan&quot; was officially recognized in Chinese literary and art circles as the &quot;signboard of the Northeast delegation&quot;.

==Modern &quot;errenzhuan&quot;==
To increase popularity and attract audiences, some troupes began to use earthier humor and language. Zhao Benshan, a well-known comedian and performer in China, started a movement called Green Errenzhuan, which avoids controversial language and sexual innuendo. Some critics have suggested this is due to pressure from the Chinese government.

In 2004, a performance of &quot;He and She&quot; in Beijing had a traditional &quot;errenzhuan&quot; story (Widow Ma&#x27;s Inn) as the first act and a French one-act play (&quot;Heart for Two&quot;, by French playwright Guy Foissy) as the second act.

<doc id="849502" wikidata="Q16347" url="?curid=849502" title="De (Cyrillic)">
<text>De (Д д; italic: &quot;Д д&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced dental stop , like the pronunciation of in &quot;door&quot;, except closer to the teeth. De is usually Romanized using the Latin letter D.

==History==
The Cyrillic letter De was derived from the Greek letter Delta (Δ δ).

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (&quot;dobro&quot;), meaning &quot;good&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, De had a value of 4.

==Form==

The major graphic difference between De and its modern Greek equivalent lies in the two descenders (&quot;feet&quot;) below the lower corners of the Cyrillic letter. The descenders were borrowed from a Byzantine uncial shape of uppercase Delta.

De, like the Cyrillic letter El, has two typographical variants: an older variant where its top is pointed (like Delta), and a modern one (first used in mid-19th-century fonts) where it is square. Nowadays, almost all books and magazines are printed with fonts with the second variant of the letter; the first one is rather stylish and only a few popular text fonts use it (the best known example is &quot;Baltika&quot; designed in 1951-52 by V. G. Chiminova and others).
In italic (Russian) type, the lowercase form looks more like the lowercase Latin , a mirrored numeral 6 or a partial derivative symbol . Southern (Serbian, Bulgarian, Macedonian) typography may prefer a variant that looks like a single-storey lowercase Latin . Cursive lowercase De has the same two shapes, but with a different distribution: for example, the &quot;g&quot;-shaped variant is a standard for schools in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus but also used for certain typefaces with OpenType features.

The (Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian-Bulgarian) cursive form of capital De looks like Latin D as the printed version is not comfortable enough to be written quickly. The Serbian cursive form is closer to the shape of a numeral &quot;2&quot; (identical to the form sometimes used for uppercase cursive Latin Q); this form is unknown in Russia.

==Usage==
It most often represents the voiced dental plosive . However, word-finally and before voiceless consonants, it represents a voiceless . Before a palatalizing vowel, it represents .

<doc id="849508" wikidata="Q209916" url="?curid=849508" title="Peak oil">
<text>Peak oil is the point when global oil production reaches its maximum rate, after which it will begin to decline irreversibly. The main concern is that global transportation relies heavily on gasoline and diesel. Transitioning to electric vehicles, biofuels, or more efficient transport (like trains and waterways) could help reduce oil demand.

Peak oil relates closely to oil depletion; while petroleum reserves are finite, the key issue is the economic viability of extraction at current prices. Initially, it was believed that oil production would decline due to reserve depletion, but a new theory suggests that reduced oil demand could lower prices, impacting extraction costs. Demand may also decline due to persistent high prices.

Over the last century, many predictions of peak oil timing have been made, often later proven incorrect due to increased extraction rates. M. King Hubbert introduced the concept in a 1956 paper, predicting U.S. production would peak between 1965 and 1971, but his global peak oil predictions were premature because of improved drilling technology. Current forecasts for the year of peak oil range from 2028 to 2050. These estimates depend on future economic trends, technological advances, and efforts to mitigate climate change.

===Defining oil===
Oil, or petroleum, is a mixture of hydrocarbon substances. By its very nature, what &quot;oil&quot; is may vary. The geology of a region affects the type of oil underground. The types of hydrocarbons produced from an oilfield may also vary depending on the geology.

Crude oil generally comes in various &#x27;grades,&#x27; commonly classified as &quot;light,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; &#x27;heavy,&quot; and &quot;extra heavy.&quot; The exact definitions of these grades vary depending on the region from which the oil came. Grades of oil are also assessed by API gravity. Light oil flows naturally to the surface or can be extracted by simply pumping it from the ground. Heavy refers to oil that has higher density and lower API gravity. It does not flow as easily, and its consistency can be similar to that of molasses. While some of it can be produced using conventional techniques, recovery rates are better using unconventional methods.

Generally, especially with regard to peak oil, the primary concern regards what is called &quot;crude oil&quot; production (which may also be referred to as &quot;crude and condensate&quot; production in US EIA statistics), which is what is actually refined into the common fuels most people know such as gasoline and diesel fuel, in addition to other common fuels. Other oil production statistics may be named &quot;total liquids production&quot; or &quot;petroleum and other liquids&quot; in EIA statistics. This includes crude oil production in addition to other hydrocarbon liquids, such as natural-gas liquids (NGLs). These two production numbers are distinct and shouldn&#x27;t be considered the same thing. Using &quot;total liquids&quot; production to refer to &quot;crude oil&quot; production is misleading. The extra liquids included in &quot;total liquids&quot; production do not refine into the same products. It can be misleading as it could be used to inflate the actual amount of crude oil being produced globally.

Where oil may come from is commonly divided into two categories, &quot;conventional&quot; oil sources and &quot;unconventional&quot; oil sources. The terms are not strictly defined and may vary within literature. As a result of the wide range of potential definitions, different oil production forecasts may vary based on which classes of liquids they choose to include or exclude. Some standard definitions for &quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;unconventional&quot; oil are detailed below.

===Conventional sources===
Conventional oil is oil that is extracted using &quot;traditional&quot; techniques (i.e., in common use before 2000) techniques. Conventional oil commonly refers to onshore oilfields and shallow offshore oilfields that are &quot;easy&quot; to extract.

It has been recognized that conventional oil production has peaked around 2005–2006. What has prevented peak oil from then on is US tight oil production, which rapidly increased since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, Canadian oil-sands production has helped increase oil supply since 2008.

In the same way, sources of natural gas production are usually divided into &quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;unconventional&quot;.

===Unconventional sources===
Unlike conventional oil, unconventional oil refers to oil that is &quot;difficult&quot; to extract. The number of steps required translates into extremely high production costs. Common unconventional oil sources include:

* Tight oil refers to oil extracted from deposits of low-permeability rock using hydraulic fracturing techniques (commonly referred to as &quot;fracking&quot;). Hydraulic fracturing is a process where a well is first drilled and then fluid containing water, chemicals, and sand is injected at very high pressures to create fractures in the rock. This process has generated controversy as fluid injections may trigger seismic activity, in addition to concerns regarding the chemicals used. Additionally, tight oil is also commonly referred to as &quot;shale oil&quot; due to the oil often being in shale deposits. Due to this nickname, tight oil is often confused with oil shale, which is a completely different process of oil extraction. This process involves manufacturing oil from the kerogen contained in an oil shale.
* Oil sands are unconsolidated sandstone deposits containing large amounts of very viscous crude bitumen or extra-heavy crude oil that can be recovered by surface mining or by in-situ oil wells using steam injection or other techniques. It can be liquefied by upgrading, blending with diluent, or by heating; and then processed by a conventional oil refinery. The material found in oil sands is an extra-heavy and viscous form of oil known as bitumen. 
Other less common unconventional oil sources include oil shale (see article).

It is worth mentioning that production of tight oil is mainly concentrated in the United States due to world-class geology and ease of borrowing (tight oil production is extremely expensive). Oil sands production is also concentrated in Canada for the same exact reasons (but different type of oil). There are also economic tight oil deposits in Argentina known as the Vaca Muerta Formation, but are less developed than tight oil in the US due to a lack of infrastructure and less capacity to borrow money.

In recent history, production of tight oil led to a resurgence of US production in the 2010s. US tight oil production initially peaked in March 2015 and fell by 12 per cent over the next 18 months; but then production rose again, and by September 2017 production had exceeded the old peak. As of 2024, US oil production, especially tight oil production, is higher than ever thanks to the Permian Basin.

Venezuela has oil sands deposits similar in size to those of Canada, and approximately equal to the world&#x27;s reserves of conventional oil. Venezuela&#x27;s Orinoco Belt tar sands are less viscous than Canada&#x27;s Athabasca oil sands – meaning they can be produced by more conventional means – but they are buried too deep to be extracted by surface mining. Estimates of the recoverable reserves of the Orinoco Belt range from to . In 2009, USGS updated this value to .

While not an actual source of unconventional oil, processes which convert other hydrocarbons into liquid fuels deserve an honorable mention, as similar to unconventional oil they are &#x27;unconventional&#x27; and very costly to produce. They include coal liquefaction or gas to liquids which produce synthetic fuels from coal or natural gas via the Fischer–Tropsch process, Bergius process, or Karrick process.

===Discoveries===

Global discoveries of oilfields peaked in the 1960s at around per year. More recently, 2021 was the worst year for oil and gas discoveries dating back to 1946. This is to be expected of a finite resource. But despite the fall-off in new field discoveries, the reported proved reserves of crude oil remaining in the ground in 2014, which totaled 1,490 billion barrels, were more than quadruple the 1965 proved reserves of 354 billion barrels. A researcher for the U.S. Energy Information Administration has pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area, most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields, but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields.

A report by the UK Energy Research Centre noted that &quot;discovery&quot; is often used ambiguously, and explained the seeming contradiction between falling discovery rates since the 1960s and increasing reserves by the phenomenon of reserve growth. The report noted that increased reserves within a field may be discovered or developed by new technology years or decades after the original discovery. But because of the practice of &quot;backdating&quot;, any new reserves within a field, even those to be discovered decades after the field discovery, are attributed to the year of initial field discovery, creating an illusion that discovery is not keeping pace with production.

As of 2010, finding new oil had reportedly become much more difficult and expensive, as oil producers had to search through more remote and inhospitable parts of the planet.

===Oil reserves===
Different classes of potential conventional crude oil reserves include crude oil with 90% certainty of being technically able to be produced from reservoirs (through a wellbore using primary, secondary, improved, enhanced, or tertiary methods); all crude with a 50% probability of being produced in the future (probable); and discovered reserves that have a 10% possibility of being produced in the future (possible). Reserve estimates based on these are referred to as 1P, proven (at least 90% probability); 2P, proven and probable (at least 50% probability); and 3P, proven, probable and possible (at least 10% probability), respectively.

As stated previously, oil is divided up into different types, therefore those counting up reserves should keep that in mind. Conventional oil reserves are different than unconventional reserves.

====Concerns over stated oil reserves====
Sadad Al Husseini estimated that of the world&#x27;s of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources.

One difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as &quot;proven&quot;. In many major producing countries, the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination.

For the most part, proven reserves are stated by the oil companies, the producer states and the consumer states. All three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves: oil companies may look to increase their potential worth; producer countries gain a stronger international stature; and governments of consumer countries may seek a means to foster sentiments of security and stability within their economies and among consumers.

Major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with the self-reported numbers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons (during periods of no substantial discoveries), over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production. Analysts have suggested that OPEC member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves, as the OPEC quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves.

====Reserves of unconventional oil====


As conventional oil becomes less available, it can be replaced with production of liquids from unconventional sources such as tight oil, oil sands, ultra-heavy oils, gas-to-liquid technologies, coal-to-liquid technologies, biofuel technologies, and shale oil. In the 2007 and subsequent International Energy Outlook editions, the word &quot;Oil&quot; was replaced with &quot;Liquids&quot; in the chart of world energy consumption. In 2009 biofuels was included in &quot;Liquids&quot; instead of in &quot;Renewables&quot;. The inclusion of natural gas liquids, a bi-product of natural gas extraction, in &quot;Liquids&quot; has been criticized as it is mostly a chemical feedstock which is generally not used as transport fuel.

Reserve estimates are based on profitability, which depends on both oil price and cost of production. Hence, unconventional sources such as heavy crude oil, oil sands, and oil shale may be included as new techniques reduce the cost of extraction. With rule changes by the SEC, oil companies can now book them as proven reserves after opening a strip mine or thermal facility for extraction. These unconventional sources are more labor and resource intensive to produce, however, requiring extra energy to refine, resulting in higher production costs and up to three times more greenhouse gas emissions per barrel (or barrel equivalent) on a &quot;well to tank&quot; basis or 10 to 45% more on a &quot;well to wheels&quot; basis, which includes the carbon emitted from combustion of the final product.

While the energy used, resources needed, and environmental effects of extracting unconventional sources have traditionally been prohibitively high, major unconventional oil sources being considered for large-scale production are the extra heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt of Venezuela, the Athabasca Oil Sands in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, and the oil shale of the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming in the United States. Energy companies such as Syncrude and Suncor have been extracting bitumen for decades but production has increased greatly in recent years with the development of steam-assisted gravity drainage and other extraction technologies.

Chuck Masters of the USGS estimates that, &quot;Taken together, these resource occurrences, in the Western Hemisphere, are approximately equal to the Identified Reserves of conventional crude oil accredited to the Middle East.&quot; Authorities familiar with the resources believe that the world&#x27;s ultimate reserves of unconventional oil are several times as large as those of conventional oil and will be highly profitable for companies as a result of higher prices in the 21st century. In October 2009, the USGS updated the Orinoco tar sands (Venezuela) recoverable &quot;mean value&quot; to , with a 90% chance of being within the range of 380-, making this area &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest recoverable oil accumulations&quot;.

Moreover, oil extracted from these sources typically contains contaminants such as sulfur and heavy metals that are energy-intensive to extract and can leave tailings, ponds containing hydrocarbon sludge, in some cases. The same applies to much of the Middle East&#x27;s undeveloped conventional oil reserves, much of which is heavy, viscous, and contaminated with sulfur and metals to the point of being unusable. However, high oil prices make these sources more financially appealing. A study by Wood Mackenzie suggests that by the early 2020s all the world&#x27;s extra oil supply is likely to come from unconventional sources.

===Production===
Globally, oil production is very concentrated. Not just geographically depending on the country, but depending on the oilfields themselves. As of 2014, it was recognized that 25 oilfields account for 25% of global oil production, and a few hundred &#x27;giant&#x27; oilfields (reserves greater than 500 million barrels) account for 50% of global oil production. Globally, the amount of oilfields is estimated to be between 50,000-70,000. Additionally, it has now been recognized that worldwide oil discoveries have been less than worldwide annual oil production since about 1980.

More recently, there has been some research about the net energy of oil production. Regarding energy production, what also matters is the &quot;Energy Return on Investment&quot; (EROI). To put it simply, in order to produce energy one must also invest some energy, and the EROI is the return on investment in energy terms. With regards to conventional and unconventional oil, it is recognized that conventional oil offers a much higher EROI than unconventional sources of oil. In reality, the EROI is felt through the cost of production. A higher EROI generally translates to a lower cost of production and higher (monetary) profits for the oil company, and a lower EROI generally translates to a higher cost of production and lower (monetary) profits for the oil company. A higher energy investment means physically using more materials (which require energy to produce) in order to produce energy. Oil sources with a lower EROI are theoretically more environmentally damaging than those with higher EROIs, due to the larger amount of resources required to extract the oil. For instance, building a gigantic oil rig produces a lot of greenhouse gas emissions, but is a requirement to access &quot;difficult&quot; deep water offshore oil reserves.

====Oil field decline====

As a finite resource, naturally every oilfield eventually declines. Generally, the production profile of a typical oil well is that first production increases, then it plateaus, and then it declines. This is the underlying assumption of the Hubbert peak theory. The chart to the right shows the decline of Alaskan oil production since after the 1980s, which is reflective of a typical pattern of decline among most oilfields.

Meanwhile, unconventional oil production follows a different production profile depending on the type. For tight oil, production begins at its maximum, or near its maximum, and then quickly peaks afterwards permanently.

As mentioned previously in the production section, oil production is very concentrated in a few fields, therefore these few fields (out of every field) can dictate where oil production would be headed. If these few fields were to decline, then all oil production would decline. In 2019 when Saudi Aramco went public, the Ghawar oilfield, which is the largest oil field in the world, was revealed to be producing much lower than what conventional wisdom at the time had assumed its production was. Although while no official data exists, certain analysts believe that the Ghawar field has entered into decline, corroborated by the aforementioned news from 2019.

According to the US EIA in 2006, Saudi Aramco Senior Vice President Abdullah Saif estimated that its existing fields were declining at a rate of 5% to 12% per year. According to a study of large oilfields (reserves greater than 500 million barrels) published in 2009, the average decline rate of onshore fields was about 5%, and offshore fields were about 9.5%. An annual rate of decline of 5.1% in 800 of the world&#x27;s largest oil fields was reported by the International Energy Agency in their World Energy Outlook 2008. In 2013 an informal study of 733 giant oil fields concluded that only 32% of the ultimately recoverable oil remained.

==Demand==
=== Peak oil demand ===
More recently, &quot;peak oil demand&quot; has become a more popular interpretation of peak oil. The International International Energy Agency (IEA) argues that the world will first intentionally reduce oil demand before supply issues actually become a problem, as to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.

Unlike peak oil demand, peak oil generally is concerned with the global supply of oil, due to the importance of oil to the global economy.

The central idea revolves around technological advancements such as the development of electric vehicles and potentially biofuels in order to phase out gasoline or diesel powered vehicles. Then, in theory, oil demand would fall over time.

In the past 4 decades, oil demand has secularly increased. Generally, oil demand increases unless there is a recession. Recently, in 2020 oil demand sharply fell from 2019 levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but recovered swiftly by 2022.

In 2020, British Petroleum (BP) claimed that the world had hit peak oil demand, predicting that oil demand would never recover to pre-pandemic levels due to increased proliferation of electric vehicles and stronger action on climate change.

As of 2023, new projections from Enverus Intelligence Research and the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest that peak oil demand will not occur before 2030. Enverus forecasts global oil demand to reach 108 million barrels per day by 2030, driven by slower improvements in fuel economy and electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. Similarly, the EIA has updated its estimates, predicting global liquid fuels consumption will be 102.91 million barrels per day in 2024 and 104.26 million barrels per day in 2025, due to higher-than-expected non-OECD consumption. These updates indicate a continued increase in oil demand, potentially exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

In 2024 OPEC suggested that global demand for oil will not decline.

=== Oil as a component of energy demand ===
Energy demand is distributed amongst four broad sectors: transportation, residential, commercial, and industrial. Oil demand primarily concerns the transportation sector, as 50% of oil use in OECD countries are for road transportation. This is a result of the proliferation of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. Transportation is therefore of particular interest to those seeking to mitigate the effects of peak oil.

As of 2023, it is forecasted by the IEA that 90% of global oil demand growth will come from the Asia-Pacific region. As of 2022, China and India are the second and third largest oil consumers globally. The United States is still the largest consumer of oil globally (as of 2022).

Generally, when countries economically develop, they use more energy, which includes using more oil. In recent years, China surpassed the United States as the world&#x27;s largest crude oil importer in 2015. This was a result of China developing in addition to US oil exports decreasing due to increased US tight oil production.

===Economic growth===
Some analysts argue that the cost of oil has a profound effect on economic growth due to its pivotal role in the extraction of resources and the processing, manufacturing, and transportation of goods. Comparing GDP and energy consumption, there is a clearly defined correlation between having a higher GDP, and having a higher energy consumption. To some degree, this is an intuitive observation as those in very undeveloped countries use a small amount of energy (no electricity), meanwhile those in developed countries use a high amount of energy (electricity consumption, gasoline consumption), and this use of energy translates into economic activity.

There is a concern by more pessimistic analysts that assuming there was a dramatic spike in the price of oil, the world economy may be unable to pay for it, leading to a disconnect between the price of oil that oil producers need to maintain supply, and the price of oil consumers need to be able to afford things. This has partially occurred in recent years with the dramatic run-up in oil prices during 2022 and then the release of the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 in order to cool down oil prices.

==Possible consequences==

The wide use of fossil fuels has been one of the most important stimuli of economic growth and prosperity since the Industrial Revolution, allowing humans to participate in takedown, or the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced. Some theorize that when oil production significantly decreases, human culture and modern technological society will be forced to change drastically. A rise in oil prices as a result of peak oil could severely impact the cost of transport, food, heating, and electricity globally. A recent example of this has been seen since Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022; a global spike in oil and energy prices exacerbated the global energy crisis (2021–present). 

The impact of oil supply limitations, assuming they occur, will depend heavily on how severe the limitations are and the development and adoption of effective alternatives.

=== Possible long-term effects on human lifestyle ===
Commodity production is heavily globalized in 2024, with almost all major supply chains relying upon diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil to power almost all global shipping and aviation fuel to power all aircraft. A study from the Geologic Survey of Finland found that 90% of the supply chain of all industrially manufactured products depend on oil derived services or oil derived products, and World Bank data shows over 30% of global GDP accounted for by exports of goods and services. Many countries with highly developed economies are dependent on food imports (for example, the United Kingdom produced just under half of domestic food consumption as of 2021), meaning a disruption in trade due to peak oil would exacerbate food insecurity. 

Since aviation relies mainly on jet fuels derived from crude oil, commercial aviation has been predicted to go into decline alongside global oil production as it would then become unaffordable for most people. Alternatives such as electric aircraft show promise, but are yet to prove commercially viable as of 2024, while hybrids approaches such as a 50% blend of aviation biofuel or utilising metal sails on cargo ships still rely on oil.

=== Possible effects on agriculture ===

Supplies of oil are absolutely critical to modern agriculture. Diesel fuel and agrichemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers are directly derived from hydrocarbons. According to Our World in Data, artificial fertilizers feed over 3.5 billion people as of 2015.

The largest consumer of fossil fuels in modern agriculture is ammonia production for fertilizer via the Haber process, which is essential to high-yielding intensive agriculture. The specific fossil fuel input to fertilizer production is primarily natural gas, to provide hydrogen via steam reforming.

More recently, some theorize that hydrogen could be generated without the use of fossil fuels by using renewable electricity for electrolysis. But as of 2024, this remains commercially unviable.

===Possible mitigation===

In 2005, the United States Department of Energy published a report titled &quot;Peaking of World Oil Production: Impacts, Mitigation, &amp; Risk Management&quot;. Known as the Hirsch report, it stated, &quot;The peaking of world oil production presents the U.S. and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem.&quot; To avoid the serious social and economic implications a global decline in oil production could entail, the Hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives, at least ten to twenty years before the peak, and to phase out the use of oil over that time. This was similar to a plan proposed for Sweden that same year. Such mitigation could include energy conservation and fuel substitution. The timing of mitigation responses is critical. Premature initiation would be undesirable, but if initiated too late could be more costly and have more negative economic consequences.

The two major oil consumers, China (second globally) and India (third globally), are taking many steps not to increase their crude oil consumption by encouraging the renewable energy options.

Methods that have been suggested for mitigating these urban and suburban issues include the use of non-petroleum vehicles such as electric vehicles, transit-oriented development, carfree cities, bicycles, light trains, smart growth, shared space, urban consolidation, urban villages, and New Urbanism.

An economic theory that has been proposed as a remedy is the introduction of a steady state economy. Such a system could include a tax shifting from income to depleting natural resources (and pollution), as well as the limitation of advertising that stimulates demand and population growth. It could also include the institution of policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve energy resources, provide local jobs, and maintain local decision-making authority. Zoning policies could be adjusted to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl.

===Potential positive aspects===
It is known that the combustion of fossil fuels emits greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change. Therefore, a reduction in oil use would be a net positive for the environment.

Permaculture sees peak oil as holding tremendous potential for positive change, assuming countries act with foresight. The rebuilding of local food networks, green energy production, and the general implementation of &quot;energy descent culture&quot; are argued to be ethical responses to the acknowledgment of finite fossil resources.

The Transition Towns movement, started in Totnes, Devon and spread internationally by &quot;The Transition Handbook&quot; (Rob Hopkins) and Transition Network, sees the restructuring of society for more local resilience and ecological stewardship as a natural response to the combination of peak oil and climate change.

==Predictions==

The idea that the rate of oil production would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one. In 1919, David White, chief geologist of the United States Geological Survey, wrote of US petroleum: &quot;... the peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years.&quot; In 1953, Eugene Ayers, a researcher for Gulf Oil, projected that if US ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels, then production in the US would peak no later than 1960. If ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels, which he warned was wishful thinking, US peak production would come no later than 1970. Likewise for the world, he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 (one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable) and 2000 (two trillion barrels recoverable). Ayers made his projections without a mathematical model. He wrote: &quot;But if the curve is made to look reasonable, it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine, in this way, the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers&quot;

By observing past discoveries and production levels, and predicting future discovery trends, the geoscientist M. King Hubbert used statistical modelling in 1956 to predict that United States oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971. While this prediction held for many decades, more recently as of 2018 daily oil production in the United States had finally exceeded its previous peak in 1970. Hubbert used a semi-logistical curved model (sometimes incorrectly compared to a normal distribution). He assumed the production rate of a limited resource would follow a roughly symmetrical distribution. Depending on the limits of exploitability and market pressures, the rise or decline of resource production over time might be sharper or more stable, appear more linear or curved. That model and its variants are now called Hubbert peak theory; they have been used to describe and predict the peak and decline of production from regions, countries, and multinational areas. The same theory has also been applied to other limited-resource production.

A comprehensive 2009 study of oil depletion by the UK Energy Research Centre noted:

The report noted that Hubbert had used the logistic curve because it was mathematically convenient, not because he believed it to be literally correct. The study observed that in most cases the asymmetric exponential model provided a better fit (as in the case of Seneca cliff model), and that peaks tended to occur well before half the oil had been produced, with the result that in nearly all cases, the post-peak decline was more gradual than the increase leading up to the peak.

=== List of past predictions of peak oil ===
In the 21st century, predictions of future oil production made in 2007 and 2009 stated either that the peak had already occurred, that oil production was on the cusp of the peak, or that it would occur soon. A decade later, world oil production would rise to a new all time high in 2018, as developments in extraction technology enabled a massive expansion of U.S. tight oil production.
Though world oil production faltered in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic causing significant disruptions in the oil markets, production in 2023 reached a new high of 101.73 million barrels per day in 2023.
==Criticisms==
===General arguments===
The theory of peak oil is controversial and became an issue of political debate in the US and Europe in the mid-2000s. Critics argued that newly found oil reserves forestalled a peak oil event. Some argued that oil production from new oil reserves and existing fields will continue to increase at a rate that outpaces demand, until alternative energy sources for current fossil fuel dependence are found. In 2015, analysts in the petroleum and financial industries claimed that the &quot;age of oil&quot; had already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue.
A consensus was emerging that parties to an international agreement would introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 °C that scientists predicted would limit environmental harm to tolerable levels.

Another argument against the peak oil theory is reduced demand from various options and technologies substituting oil. US federal funding to develop algae fuels increased since 2000 due to rising fuel prices. Many other projects are being funded in
Australia, New Zealand, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere and private companies are entering the field.

===Oil industry representatives===
John Hofmeister, president of Royal Dutch Shell&#x27;s US operations, while agreeing that conventional oil production would soon start to decline, criticized the analysis of peak oil theory by Matthew Simmons for being &quot;overly focused on a single country: Saudi Arabia, the world&#x27;s largest exporter and OPEC swing producer.&quot; Hofmeister pointed to the large reserves at the US outer continental shelf, which held an estimated of oil and natural gas. However, only 15% of those reserves were currently exploitable, a good part of that off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

Hofmeister also pointed to unconventional sources of oil such as the oil sands of Canada, where Shell was active. The Canadian oil sands—a natural combination of sand, water, and oil found largely in Alberta and Saskatchewan—are believed to contain one trillion barrels of oil. Another trillion barrels are also said to be trapped in rocks in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, in the form of oil shale. Environmentalists argue that major environmental, social, and economic obstacles would make extracting oil from these areas excessively difficult. Hofmeister argued that if oil companies were allowed to drill more in the United States enough to produce another , oil and gas prices would not be as high as they were in the late 2000s. He thought in 2008 that high energy prices would cause social unrest similar to the 1992 Rodney King riots.

In 2009, Dr. Christof Rühl, chief economist of BP, argued against the peak oil
hypothesis:
Rühl argued that the main limitations for oil availability are &quot;above ground&quot; factors such as the availability of staff, expertise, technology, investment security, funds, and global warming, and that the oil question was about price and not the physical availability.

In 2008, Daniel Yergin of CERA suggest that a recent high price phase might add to a future demise of the oil industry, not of complete exhaustion of resources or an apocalyptic shock but the timely and smooth setup of alternatives. Yergin went on to say, &quot;This is the fifth time that the world is said to be running out of oil. Each time-whether it was the &#x27;gasoline famine&#x27; at the end of WWI or the &#x27;permanent shortage&#x27; of the 1970s-technology and the opening of new frontier areas have banished the spectre of decline. There&#x27;s no reason to think that technology is finished this time.&quot;

In 2006, Clive Mather, CEO of Shell Canada, said the Earth&#x27;s supply of bitumen hydrocarbons was &quot;almost infinite&quot;, referring to hydrocarbons in oil sands.

===Others===
In 2006 attorney and mechanical engineer Peter W. Huber asserted that the world was just running out of &quot;cheap oil&quot;, explaining that as oil prices rise, unconventional sources become economically viable. He predicted that, &quot;[t]he tar sands of Alberta alone contain enough hydrocarbon to fuel the entire planet for over 100 years.&quot;

Environmental journalist George Monbiot responded to a 2012 report by Leonardo Maugeri by suggesting that there is more than enough oil (from unconventional sources) to &quot;deep-fry&quot; the world with climate change. Stephen Sorrell, senior lecturer Science and Technology Policy Research, Sussex Energy Group, and lead author of the UKERC Global Oil Depletion report, and Christophe McGlade, doctoral researcher at the UCL Energy Institute have criticized Maugeri&#x27;s assumptions about decline rates.

<text>The coal mining town of Dundee is situated in a valley of the Biggarsberg mountains in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (). It is part of the Endumeni Municipality, Umzinyathi District. It is very rich in coal deposits. More populous than the town of Dundee is its adjacent township named Sibongile. This township is now being extended with many residing zones, e.g. Lindelani.

Dundee was established by Peter Smith, with land contributed by his son in-law, in 1882 after the realisation that the valley was a natural way for travellers into the interior of Africa. Traders, hunters explorers, missionaries and soldiers all made their way through here. A large fort, Fort Jones, housed British troops in the area during the Anglo Zulu War of 1879. The discovery of coal in the area dates from early Voortrekker records of 1838 and later geological surveys in the 1860s. It is named after the hometown of a pioneering Scottish settler, Peter Smith. At first, Dundee was a farm (Dundee farm), the property of Peter Smith, which he had bought from a Voortrekker settler, Mr Dekker. Three other men are also credited with the founding of Dundee; his son William Craighead Smith, son-in-law Dugald McPhail, and close family friend Charles Wilson.&lt;Talana Museum&gt;

==Geography==
The town lies nestled in a valley of the picturesque Biggarsberg and is surrounded by historical remarkable mountains of “Indumeni” (where the thunder rolls), “Mpati” (The place of good waters), and “Talana” (The shelf where precious items are kept). Dundee has trails of the San people that lived here 4 000 – 5 000 years ago. Evidence of this is to be found in lifestyle and rock paintings in several caves and shelters.

===Climate===
Dundee has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with pleasant summers and cool, dry winters. The average annual precipitation is , with rainfall occurring mainly during summer.

==History==
* The Boers reported surface coal here and named one of the streams Steenkoolspruit (Afrikaans for &quot;Coal Stream&quot;).
* Peter Smith, a Scottish settler started sending wagonloads of coal, which was discovered close to the surface, to be sold in Pietermaritzburg. This started the coal mining industry in Natal.
* The first geological survey of the Natal coalfields was made in the 1860s and proved that there were workable coal deposits.
* In 1882 a town was laid out and named after Smith’s Scottish hometown Dundee.
* Smith, with partners Dougald McPhail and Charles Willson, floated the Dundee Coal and Estate Company on the London Stock Exchange in 1899.
*Second Boer War: The British started massing troops at Dundee and were given an ultimatum by the Boers to retreat with the troops. On 20 October 1899, the first shots of the war were fired. The news of this battle hit the headlines in Britain as the &quot;Battle of Glencoe&quot;, which was corrected the following day to the &quot;Battle of Dundee&quot; and on the third day to the &quot;Battle of Talana.&quot; It was on the slopes of Talana Hill that the British army troops officially wore khaki uniforms for the first time in battle; it is also notable as the first indisputable use of indirect fire in modern warfare, and the tactic as applied by Boer field artillery had a devastating effect. After the battle, the British troops retreated to Ladysmith and Boer forces occupied the town, renaming it Meyersdorp. This occupation lasted seven months. Dundee was relieved after the battle of Helpmekaar in May 1900.

* The town&#x27;s folk who had left before or shortly after the battle returned and the town began to flourish again. Dundee soon emerged as a boomtown graced with stately homes and the first theatre north of Durban.
* Pioneer traders from the Indian sub-continent settled here during the following decade, when Dundee became the meeting place of seven roads into the hinterland and coast of Africa.
* Mahatma Gandhi was tried in the Dundee courthouse for civil disobedience and imprisoned in the Dundee jail.

==Popular culture==
* The poem &quot;The Battle of Dundee&quot; aka &quot;How President Kruger&#x27;s Irish Took in Her Majestys Hiberians&quot; by Rev I. Dempsey about the battle was widely circulated in print media of the time.
* In the Disney Channel Movie The Color of Friendship, one of the main characters, Mahree Bok, is from Dundee.

==Sport==
The Northern-Natal Rhinos (Noord-Natal Renosters) Wrestling Club in Dundee is one of the top wrestling clubs in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal.

Sentraal Rugby Club is one of the top sides in Northern-Natal. Titans Rugby club is a youth rugby team that builds future rugby players (Grassroots). Rhino Women&#x27;s Rugby Club has constantly produced Sharks Craven week players and have represented Umzinyathi District in the annual Salga games

==Coat of arms==
Dundee was a borough in its own right from 1902 to 1996. In October 1951, the council obtained a grant of arms from the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland. It registered the arms at the Bureau of Heraldry in July 1995.

The arms, which were based on those of the Scottish burgh of Dundee, were : &quot;Azure, a pot with three lilies issuant Argent, charged with a miner&#x27;s lamp proper and on a chief Or two wildebeest courant in fess, Sable; the shield ensigned of a mural crown Argent&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms : a blue shield displaying two black wildebeest on a golden strip above three lilies in a silver pot decorated with a miner&#x27;s lamp. The motto was &quot;Per victoriam laboremque&quot;.

<text>Geronthres (), named after ancient Geronthrae, is a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Evrotas, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 236.780 km2. The seat of administration was the village . The municipal population is approx. 1,700.

Dutch excavations (University of Amsterdam) point to first settlement of the acropolis hill in the (Final) Neolithic period. In the Early Helladic period the site must have contained an administrative centre of some kind, judged by the sealing fragments that can be compared by those found in Lerna. Habitation continued towards the end of the Middle Helladic period, but no Mycenaean finds have been found yet. First signs of renewed habitation date from the Iron Age. The site is left again in the Roman period.

Close to Geraki is the medieval fortress after which the village is named, and which formed the seat of the Barony of Geraki in the Frankish Principality of Achaea. In the village itself are several Byzantine-era churches.

<doc id="849531" wikidata="Q840738" url="?curid=849531" title="TCP offload engine">
<text>TCP offload engine (TOE) is a technology used in some network interface cards (NIC) to offload processing of the entire TCP/IP stack to the network controller. It is primarily used with high-speed network interfaces, such as gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet, where processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant.
TOEs are often used as a way to reduce the overhead associated with Internet Protocol (IP) storage protocols such as iSCSI and Network File System (NFS).

==Purpose==
Originally TCP was designed for unreliable low speed networks (such as early dial-up modems) but with the growth of the Internet in terms of backbone transmission speeds (using Optical Carrier, Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet links) and faster and more reliable access mechanisms (such as DSL and cable modems) it is frequently used in data centers and desktop PC environments at speeds of over 1 Gigabit per second. At these speeds the TCP software implementations on host systems require significant computing power. In the early 2000s, full-duplex gigabit TCP communication could consume more than 80% of a 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 processor, resulting in small or no processing resources left for the applications to run on the system.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol which adds complexity and processing overhead. These aspects include:
* Connection establishment using the &quot;3-way handshake&quot; (SYNchronize; SYNchronize-ACKnowledge; ACKnowledge).
* Acknowledgment of packets as they are received by the far end, adding to the message flow between the endpoints and thus the protocol load.
* Checksum and sequence number calculations - again a burden on a general purpose CPU to perform.
* Sliding window calculations for packet acknowledgement and congestion control.
* Connection termination.

Moving some or all of these functions to dedicated hardware, a TCP offload engine, frees the system&#x27;s main CPU for other tasks.

===Freed-up CPU cycles===
A generally accepted rule of thumb is that 1 Hertz of CPU processing is required to send or receive of TCP/IP. For example, 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s) of network traffic requires 5 GHz of CPU processing. This implies that 2 entire cores of a 2.5 GHz multi-core processor will be required to handle the TCP/IP processing associated with 5 Gbit/s of TCP/IP traffic. Since Ethernet (10GE in this example) is bidirectional, it is possible to send and receive 10 Gbit/s (for an aggregate throughput of 20 Gbit/s). Using the 1 Hz/(bit/s) rule this equates to eight 2.5 GHz cores.

Many of the CPU cycles used for TCP/IP processing are &quot;freed-up&quot; by TCP/IP offload and may be used by the CPU (usually a server CPU) to perform other tasks such as file system processing (in a file server) or indexing (in a backup media server). In other words, a server with TCP/IP offload can do more server work than a server without TCP/IP offload NICs.

===Reduction of PCI traffic===
In addition to the protocol overhead that TOE can address, it can also address some architectural issues that affect a large percentage of host based (server and PC) endpoints.
Many older end point hosts are PCI bus based, which provides a standard interface for the addition of certain peripherals such as Network Interfaces to Servers and PCs.
PCI is inefficient for transferring small bursts of data from main memory, across the PCI bus to the network interface ICs, but its efficiency improves as the data burst size increases. Within the TCP protocol, a large number of small packets are created (e.g. acknowledgements) and as these are typically generated on the host CPU and transmitted across the PCI bus and out the network physical interface, this impacts the host computer IO throughput.

A TOE solution, located on the network interface, is located on the other side of the PCI bus from the CPU host so it can address this I/O efficiency issue, as the data to be sent across the TCP connection can be sent to the TOE from the CPU across the PCI bus using large data burst sizes with none of the smaller TCP packets having to traverse the PCI bus.

==History==
One of the first patents in this technology, for UDP offload, was issued to Auspex Systems in early 1990. Auspex founder Larry Boucher and a number of Auspex engineers went on to found Alacritech in 1997 with the idea of extending the concept of network stack offload to TCP and implementing it in custom silicon. They introduced the first parallel-stack full offload network card in early 1999; the company&#x27;s SLIC (Session Layer Interface Card) was the predecessor to its current TOE offerings. Alacritech holds a number of patents in the area of TCP/IP offload.

By 2002, as the emergence of TCP-based storage such as iSCSI spurred interest, it was said that &quot;At least a dozen newcomers, most founded toward the end of the dot-com bubble, are chasing the opportunity for merchant semiconductor accelerators for storage protocols and applications, vying with half a dozen entrenched vendors and in-house ASIC designs.&quot;

In 2005 Microsoft licensed Alacritech&#x27;s patent base and along with Alacritech created the partial TCP offload architecture that has become known as TCP chimney offload. TCP chimney offload centers on the Alacritech &quot;Communication Block Passing Patent&quot;. At the same time, Broadcom also obtained a license to build TCP chimney offload chips.

==Types==

Instead of replacing the TCP stack with a TOE entirely, there are alternative techniques to offload some operations in co-operation with the operating system&#x27;s TCP stack. TCP checksum offload and large segment offload are supported by the majority of today&#x27;s Ethernet NICs. Newer techniques like large receive offload and TCP acknowledgment offload are already implemented in some high-end Ethernet hardware, but are effective even when implemented purely in software.

===Parallel-stack full offload===
Parallel-stack full offload gets its name from the concept of two parallel TCP/IP Stacks. The first is the main host stack which is included with the host OS. The second or &quot;parallel stack&quot; is connected between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer (TCP) using a &quot;vampire tap&quot;. The vampire tap intercepts TCP connection requests by applications and is responsible for TCP connection management as well as TCP data transfer. Many of the criticisms in the following section relate to this type of TCP offload.

===HBA full offload===
HBA (Host Bus Adapter) full offload is found in iSCSI host adapters which present themselves as disk controllers to the host system while connecting (via TCP/IP) to an iSCSI storage device. This type of TCP offload not only offloads TCP/IP processing but it also offloads the iSCSI initiator function. Because the HBA appears to the host as a disk controller, it can only be used with iSCSI devices and is not appropriate for general TCP/IP offload.

===TCP chimney partial offload===
TCP chimney offload addresses the major security criticism of parallel-stack full offload. In partial offload, the main system stack controls all connections to the host. After a connection has been established between the local host (usually a server) and a foreign host (usually a client) the connection and its state are passed to the TCP offload engine. The heavy lifting of data transmit and receive is handled by the offload device. Almost all TCP offload engines use some type of TCP/IP hardware implementation to perform the data transfer without host CPU intervention. When the connection is closed, the connection state is returned from the offload engine to the main system stack. Maintaining control of TCP connections allows the main system stack to implement and control connection security.

===Large receive offload===
Large receive offload (LRO) is a technique for increasing inbound throughput of high-bandwidth network connections by reducing central processing unit (CPU) overhead. It works by aggregating multiple incoming packets from a single stream into a larger buffer before they are passed higher up the networking stack, thus reducing the number of packets that have to be processed. Linux implementations generally use LRO in conjunction with the New API (NAPI) to also reduce the number of interrupts.

According to benchmarks, even implementing this technique entirely in software can increase network performance significantly. , the Linux kernel supports LRO for TCP in software only. FreeBSD 8 supports LRO in hardware on adapters that support it.
LRO should not operate on machines acting as routers, as it breaks the end-to-end principle and can significantly impact performance.

====Generic receive offload====
Generic receive offload (GRO) implements a generalised LRO in software that isn&#x27;t restricted to TCP/IPv4 or have the issues created by LRO.

===Large send offload===
In computer networking, large send offload (LSO) is a technique for increasing egress throughput of high-bandwidth network connections by reducing CPU overhead. It works by passing a multipacket buffer to the network interface card (NIC). The NIC then splits this buffer into separate packets. The technique is also called TCP segmentation offload (TSO) or generic segmentation offload (GSO) when applied to TCP. LSO and LRO are independent and use of one does not require the use of the other. 

When a system needs to send large chunks of data out over a computer network, the chunks first need breaking down into smaller segments that can pass through all the network elements like routers and switches between the source and destination computers. This process is referred to as &quot;segmentation&quot;. Often the TCP protocol in the host computer performs this segmentation. Offloading this work to the NIC is called &quot;TCP segmentation offload&quot; (TSO).

For example, a unit of 64 KiB (65,536 bytes) of data is usually segmented to 45 segments of 1460 bytes each before it is sent through the NIC and over the network. With some intelligence in the NIC, the host CPU can hand over the 64 KB of data to the NIC in a single transmit-request, the NIC can break that data down into smaller segments of 1460 bytes, add the TCP, IP, and data link layer protocol headers — according to a template provided by the host&#x27;s TCP/IP stack — to each segment, and send the resulting frames over the network. This significantly reduces the work done by the CPU. many new NICs on the market support TSO.

Some network cards implement TSO generically enough that it can be used for offloading fragmentation of other transport layer protocols, or for doing IP fragmentation for protocols that don&#x27;t support fragmentation by themselves, such as UDP.

==Support in Linux==
Unlike other operating systems, such as FreeBSD, the Linux kernel does not include support for TOE (not to be confused with other types of network offload). While there are patches from the hardware manufacturers such as Chelsio or Qlogic that add TOE support, the Linux kernel developers are opposed to this technology for several reasons:
* &quot;Security&quot; – because TOE is implemented in hardware, patches must be applied to the TOE firmware, instead of just software, to address any security vulnerabilities found in a particular TOE implementation. This is further compounded by the newness and vendor-specificity of this hardware, as compared to a well tested TCP/IP stack as is found in an operating system that does not use TOE.
* &quot;Limitations&quot; of hardware – because connections are buffered and processed on the TOE chip, resource starvation can more easily occur as compared to the generous CPU and memory available to the operating system.
* &quot;Complexity&quot; – TOE breaks the assumption that kernels make about having access to all resources at all times – details such as memory used by open connections are not available with TOE. TOE also requires very large changes to a networking stack in order to be supported properly, and even when that is done, features like quality of service and packet filtering might not work.
* &quot;Proprietary&quot; – TOE is implemented differently by each hardware vendor. This means more code must be rewritten to deal with the various TOE implementations, at a cost of the aforementioned complexity and, possibly, security. Furthermore, TOE firmware cannot be easily modified since it is closed-source.
* &quot;Obsolescence&quot; – Each TOE NIC has a limited lifetime of usefulness, because system hardware rapidly catches up to TOE performance levels, and eventually exceeds TOE performance levels.

==Suppliers==
Much of the current work on TOE technology is by manufacturers of 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface cards, such as Broadcom, Chelsio Communications, Emulex, Mellanox Technologies, QLogic.

<doc id="849533" wikidata="Q269781" url="?curid=849533" title="Yellowfin tuna">
<text>The yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) is a species of tuna found in pelagic waters of tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide.

Yellowfin is often marketed as ahi, from the Hawaiian , a name also used there for the closely related bigeye tuna. The species name, &quot;albacares&quot; (&quot;white meat&quot;) can also lead to confusion: in English, the albacore (&quot;Thunnus alalunga&quot;) is a different species, while yellowfin is officially designated &quot;albacore&quot; in French and referred to as &quot;albacora&quot; by Portuguese fishermen.
==Description==
The yellowfin tuna is among the larger tuna species, reaching weights over , but is significantly smaller than the Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas, which can reach over , and slightly smaller than the bigeye tuna and the southern bluefin tuna.

The second dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of sickles or scimitars. The pectoral fins are also longer than the related bluefin tuna, but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is a very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines.

Reported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as in length and in weight. The all-tackle International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species stands at for a yellowfin caught in 2012 off Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The fisherman received a prize of $1 million once the catch was confirmed by the IGFA.

==Habitat==
Yellowfin tuna are epipelagic fish that inhabit the mixed surface layer of the ocean above the thermocline. Sonic tracking has found that although yellowfin tuna, unlike the related bigeye tuna, mostly range in the top of the water column, another study reported that depth tends to vary with time of day: 90% of their recorded depth values were shallower than during the night, and shallower than during the day.

Although yellowfin tuna penetrate the thermocline relatively infrequently, they are capable of diving to considerable depths. An individual tagged in the Indian Ocean with an archival tag spent 85% of its time in depths shallower than , but was recorded as having made three dives to , and . The maximum dive depth measured in a second study was .

==Behavior==
Although mainly found in deep offshore waters, yellowfin tuna may approach shore when suitable conditions exist. Mid-ocean islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago, other island groups in the Western Pacific, Caribbean and Maldives islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as the volcanic islands of the Atlantic such as Ascension Island and Saint Helena, often harbor yellowfin feeding on the baitfish these spots concentrate close to the shoreline. Yellowfin may venture well inshore of the continental shelf when water temperature and clarity are suitable and food is abundant.

Yellowfin tuna often travel in schools with similarly sized companions. They sometimes school with other tuna species and mixed schools of small yellowfin, and skipjack tuna, in particular, are commonplace. They are often associated with various species of dolphins or porpoises, as well as with larger marine creatures such as whales and whale sharks. They also associate with drifting flotsam such as logs and pallets, and sonic tagging indicates some follow moving vessels. Hawaiian yellowfins associate with anchored fish aggregation devices and with certain sections of the 50-fathom curve.

==Diet and predation==
Yellowfin tuna prey include other fish, pelagic crustaceans and squid. Like all tunas, their body shape is particularly adapted for speed, enabling them to pursue and capture fast-moving baitfish such as flying fish, sauries and mackerel. Schooling species such as myctophids or lanternfish and similar pelagic driftfish, anchovies and sardines are frequently taken. Large yellowfins prey on smaller members of the tuna family such as frigate mackerel and skipjack tuna.

In turn, yellowfin are preyed upon when young by other pelagic hunters, including larger tuna, seabirds and predatory fishes such as wahoo, shark and billfish. Adults are threatened only by the largest and fastest hunters, such as toothed whales, particularly the false killer whale, pelagic sharks such as the mako and great white, large Atlantic blue marlin and Pacific blue marlin, and black marlin. The main source of mortality, however, is industrial tuna fisheries.

Yellowfins are able to escape most predators because of their speed, swimming at up to .
Unlike most fish, tuna are warm-blooded.
Their unique cardiovascular system, warm body temperature, elevated metabolism and well-developed lymphatic system are all involved in their ability to engage in both rapid bursts and long periods of swimming. When swimming rapidly, a tuna&#x27;s fins retract into grooves to form a smooth hydrodynamic surface and increase its speed, due to a biological hydraulic system involving the lymphatic system.

The behavior of abruptly diving to deeper levels may be a tactic to escape predators. Evidence from trackers even includes a case in which a diving yellowfin tuna may have been swallowed at a depth of .

==Commercial fishery==
Modern commercial fisheries catch yellowfin tuna with encircling nets (purse seines), and by industrial longlines. In 2010, 558,761 metric tons of yellowfin tuna were caught in the western and central Pacific Ocean.

===Pole and line===
Formerly, much of the commercial catch was made by pole-and-line fishing, using live bait such as anchovy to attract schools of tuna close to the fishing vessel that were then taken with baited jigs on sturdy bamboo or fiberglass poles or on handlines. This fishery, which targeted skipjack and occasionally albacore, as well as yellowfin, for canning, reached its heyday between World War I and the 1950s before declining. The most well-known fleet of pole-and-line boats sailed from San Diego in California and exploited abundant stocks in Mexican waters, as well as further south to Panama, Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands.

Pole-and-line fishing is still carried out today in the Maldives, Ghana, the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. Few pole-and-line boats now specifically target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch is a mix of skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often associate with them.

===Purse seining===

Purse seining largely took over commercial tuna fisheries in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, purse seines account for more of the commercial catch than any other method. The purse-seine fishery primarily operates in the Pacific Ocean, in the historic tuna grounds of the San Diego tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific, and in the islands of the western Pacific, where many U.S. tuna canneries relocated in the 1980s, but significant purse-seine catches are also made in the Indian Ocean and in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially in the Gulf of Guinea by French and Spanish vessels.

Purse-seine vessels locate tuna using onboard lookouts, as was done in the pole-and-line fishery, but they also employ sophisticated onboard electronics, sea-surface temperature and other satellite data, and helicopters overhead. Once a school is located, the net is set around it. A single set may yield . Modern tuna seiners have a capacity up to , reach speeds of over , and carry multiple spotting helicopters.

Purse seining for yellowfin tuna became highly controversial in the late 1970s when it became apparent that the eastern Pacific fishery was killing many spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins and other cetaceans (often called &quot;porpoises&quot; by the tuna fleet) that accompany the fish. This association has been long-recognized by commercial tuna fishermen.

====Dolphin-friendly labeling====
Since the introduction of &quot;dolphin-friendly&quot; labeling, an increasing number of purse seine sets are now made on &quot;free schools&quot; unassociated with dolphins, as well as schools that associate with floating objects—another long-understood association that has grown in importance in tuna fisheries. The latter practice in particular has a major ecological impact because of the high proportion of bycatch, including manta rays, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, billfish and other threatened marine species taken by setting nets around logs and other floating objects. Such tuna are often significantly smaller than the larger adult tuna associated with dolphins. The removal of huge numbers of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have yet to reach breeding age has major potential consequences for tuna stocks worldwide.

===Longline===
Most of the commercial catch is canned, but the &quot;sashimi&quot; marketplace adds significant demand for high-quality fish. This market is primarily supplied by industrial tuna longline vessels.

Industrial longlining was primarily perfected by Japanese fishermen who expanded into new grounds in the Western Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Longlining has since been adopted by other fishermen, most notably South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.

Tuna longlining targets larger &quot;sashimi&quot;-grade fish around and up that swim deeper in the water column. In tropical and warm temperate areas, the more valuable bigeyes are often the main target, but significant effort is also directed towards larger yellowfins. Longlining seeks areas of higher ocean productivity indicated by temperature and chlorophyll fronts formed by upwellings, ocean current eddies and major bathymetric features. Satellite imaging technology is the primary tool for locating these dynamic and constantly changing ocean areas.

Bycatch is a major environmental issue in the longline fishery, especially impacting billfish, sea turtles, pelagic sharks and seabirds.

===Artisanal fisheries===
Besides the large-scale industrial purse seine and longline fisheries, yellowfin tuna also support smaller-scale artisanal fisheries that have often supplied local domestic markets for generations. Artisanal fisheries now also often fish for the lucrative &quot;sashimi&quot; market in many locations where international air shipment is possible.

Artisanal fishermen tend to employ assorted hook-and-line gear such as trolling lines, surface and deep handlines and longlines.

By far, the largest fishery using artisanal methods exists in Philippine and Indonesian waters where thousands of fishermen target yellowfin tuna around fish aggregation devices or &quot;payaos&quot;, although this fishery far exceeds the artisanal scale in terms of tonnage caught and the numbers of participants involved, and should more properly be considered a commercial handline fishery. General Santos is the most important Philippine port for the landing and transhipment of catches. Catches that qualify as &quot;sashimi&quot; grade are mostly shipped to the Japanese market; those that do not meet the grade are sold locally or canned. Elsewhere in the Pacific, small-boat fishers in Hawaii, Tahiti and other Pacific islands supply local and in some cases foreign markets with fresh yellowfins.

Handline-caught yellowfin tuna is one of the few exports of the economy of St. Helena.

==Sport fishing==
Yellowfin tuna probably first came to the attention of sport fishermen when they appeared on the tuna grounds of Catalina Island, California, only a few years after pioneering fishermen invented the sport, targeting the Pacific bluefin tuna. These tuna were of the same species caught by commercial fishermen in Japan and the western Pacific, but the reason for their appearance was not known at the time. Later, warmer water species such as yellowfin tuna, dorado and striped marlin were found to enter southern California waters in seasons having favorable ocean conditions, particularly during the El Niño phenomenon, which brings warmer water up North America&#x27;s western coast.

Yellowfin tuna were subsequently discovered by sport fishermen in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hawaii and many other parts of their range. Larger adult fish which had developed distinctively long sickle fins were initially thought to be a different species and were known as Allison tuna (a name first given by the then curator of the Bermuda Aquarium, Louis Mowbray, in 1920). Such destinations as Hawaii and Bermuda became famed for their catches of these beautiful fish. In Hawaii, various styles of feather lures served as bait, but in Bermuda, chumming techniques from boats anchored on productive banks were evolved to target not only Allison tuna, but also wahoo and the smaller blackfin tuna. Bermudian experts developed techniques to take all these fish on light tackle, and for many years the International Game Fish Association records for yellowfin tuna were dominated by entries from Bermuda in the lighter line classes, with fish in the and larger class from Hawaii taking most of the heavier line-class records.

Today, yellowfin tuna are a major sport fish pursued by sport fishermen in many parts of the world. Thousands of anglers fish for yellowfin tuna along the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly in North Carolina and New England. Yellowfin are also a popular gamefish among anglers fishing from U.S. Gulf Coast ports, San Diego and other ports of southern California. Larger &quot;long-range&quot; boats in the San Diego fleet also fish in Mexican waters, searching for yellowfin tuna in many of the grounds that the San Diego pole-and-line tuna clippers used to fish. The yellowfin tuna is also a highly prized catch in the offshore sport fisheries of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Sport fishing for yellowfin tuna exists on a smaller scale in many other parts of the world.

=== Gulf of Mexico ===
Recreational fishing for yellowfin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico is a significant contributor to the region&#x27;s economy, with an estimated economic impact of $7 billion annually. This type of fishing has led to the development of a thriving tourism industry, with many fishing charters and resorts offering guided trips and equipment rental services to visitors.

Yellowfin tuna are highly sought after for their impressive size and excellent taste, making them a popular target for recreational anglers. The thrill of reeling in a massive yellowfin tuna has attracted many fishing enthusiasts to the Gulf of Mexico, creating a significant source of revenue for local businesses and communities. To ensure the sustainability of yellowfin tuna populations in the Gulf of Mexico, many fishing organizations have implemented catch limits and other measures to protect these fish for future generations of recreational fishermen to enjoy. 

=== Clubs ===
During the early 1900s many yellowfin tuna fishing clubs were formed around the world. In 1917, the Yokohama Fishing Club was founded, becoming the first fishing club in Japan to cater to foreigners. The Tuna Club of Avalon, which was founded in 1898 in Avalon, California played an instrumental role in the development of the sport in North America. While in Europe The Club Nautico de San Remo in Italy and the Club Nautique de Cannes in France are two of the earliest known clubs to organize yellowfin tuna fishing tournaments in these countries, with the first tournaments held in the late 1960s.

==Cuisine==
According to the Hawaii Seafood Buyers Guide, yellowfin tuna is widely used in raw fish dishes, especially &quot;sashimi&quot;. This fish is also excellent for grilling. Yellowfin is often served seared rare.

Yellowfin buyers recognize two grades, &quot;&quot;sashimi&quot; grade&quot; and &quot;other&quot;, although variation in the quality of &quot;other&quot; grades occurs.

Different seafood sustainability guides come to different conclusions about whether yellowfin fishing is sustainable. The Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Seafood Guide&quot; (a guide for what types of marine food products are not ecofriendly) lists troll-caught tuna as &quot;OK&quot;, but labels long-line caught as &quot;Be Careful&quot;.

Yellowfin is becoming a popular replacement for the severely depleted supplies of southern bluefin tuna.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list. The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a &quot;list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries&quot;.

<doc id="849541" wikidata="Q7493706" url="?curid=849541" title="Shell V-Power">
<text>Shell V-Power is the brand name given to Shell&#x27;s enhanced high specification fuels for road motor vehicles including &quot;Shell V-Power Nitro+&quot; and &quot;Shell V-Power Diesel&quot;. Introduced in Italy in 2001, Shell relaunched the fuel in March 2008, under the name Nitrogen-Enriched Shell V-Power, with nitrogen-containing detergents.

Initially used for higher octane Super Unleaded petrol/gasoline (formerly known as Optimax in some regions), it is now additionally used for high specification diesel fuel.

==V-Power petrol==
Petrol or gasoline is assessed, categorised and sold by an octane rating. Generally, in most areas of the world, the Research Octane Number (RON) is used, but in North America, the Anti-Knock Index (AKI) is used. Conventional &#x27;standard&#x27; &quot;Super Unleaded&quot; petrol in Europe, South Asia and Australia has an octane rating of 95 RON, and in North America &quot;Premium Unleaded&quot; is AKI/RdON/PON 91–93 (RON 96–98). However, higher octane &quot;Super Plus Unleaded&quot; – often formulated with higher quality additives, is usually set at around 98 RON in mainland Europe; but this can vary by market. Most oil and petroleum companies now market their own Super Plus Unleaded petrols under a unique name – and the current name for Shell Super Unleaded fuel is &quot;V-Power&quot;. Like most Super Plus Unleaded petrols, V-Power also contains higher concentrations of detergents and other additives to help clean the engine and smooth its operation.

In the United Kingdom and Denmark (where Super Plus Unleaded must be a minimum of 97 RON), V-Power has a rating of 99 RON (whereas V-Power&#x27;s predecessor Shell Optimax was rated at 98 RON). There are two other 99 RON fuels available in the UK, namely Tesco Momentum99 and more recently Esso Synergy Supreme+ 99.

In the Netherlands, V-Power used to have a 95 RON rating, although officials from Shell stated it effectively had a 97 RON rating. Due to the limited categories of 92 RON, 95 RON, 98 RON and 100 RON, it was officially rated at 95. These days, the RON rating of the V-power petrol in the Netherlands is rated at 98.

In Germany, all Shell stations offer V-Power Racing 100, rated at 100 RON. In Greece, all Shell stations offer V-Power rated at 97 RON. Most Shell stations also offer V-Power Racing (100 RON).
In Australia, from October 2006, Shell and Coles Express re-branded Optimax to V-Power (98 RON). V-Power Racing, the ultra-high performance variant has a rating of 100 RON although Shell decided to phase out V-Power Racing from 21 July to mid August 2008, instead recommending V-Power. The previously obtainable higher grade V-Power Racing which contained 5% ethanol to boost V-Power&#x27;s octane rating to 100 RON has now been phased out by Shell due to a &quot;changing market&quot;.

In the United States, in around 2004, all Shell &quot;Premium&quot; gas was rebranded as &quot;V-Power&quot;. In 2015, Shell re-branded V-Power to the newly launched V-Power Nitro+.

In Canada, from June 2005, Shell Canada re-branded Optimax Gold to V-Power. In 2015, Shell Canada re-branded V-Power to V-Power Nitro+.

In Hong Kong, as there is no oil refinery plant, gasoline was imported from Singapore, which is 98 RON. However, V-Power sold in gas stations was rumoured to reach 167 RON (the highest native RON for consumer grade commercial petrol worldwide). Such a figure was not supported by any actual test, nor was it confirmed by Shell and was contradicted by a report of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

In New Zealand, from 2007, Shell rebranded 95 Premium Unleaded as V-Power. It was still rated at 95 RON. Shell sold its New Zealand retail operations in 2010, to a consortium which later became Z Energy, and upon re-branding Shell V-Power was replaced with ZX Premium Unleaded.

In Sweden, Shell V-Power was previously 99 RON, but is now been re-branded under the new owner St1 from June 2011, to &quot;Shell V-Power E5&quot; making it 98 RON with a mix of 5% ethanol.

In Argentina, V-Power is the grade 3 fuel sold by Shell, rated at 98 RON. In the Philippines, Pilipinas Shell launches the new Shell V-Power (replacing Shell Velocity) in 2006. On June 1, 2012, Shell Philippines launches the premium fuel grade, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Gasoline (formerly Shell Super Premium) and Shell V-Power Nitro+ Racing (formerly Shell V-Power). In Indonesia, from April 2013, Shell rebranded 95 Super Extra as V-Power with additional additives. While it is still rated at 95 RON.

In Malaysia &amp; Singapore, it is RON98, the octane is higher for V-Power Racing. In Philippines, on June 8, 2017, V-Power Nitro+ was replaced with V-Power with Dynaflex technology. In Russia, all Shell stations offer V-Power rated 95 RON, some stations also offer V-Power Racing (98 RON).

==V-Power Diesel==

V-Power Diesel is Shell&#x27;s version of an enhanced diesel fuel, similar to BP&#x27;s &#x27;Ultimate Diesel&#x27;. Like BP Ultimate Diesel, Shell V-Power Diesel is designed for modern compression-ignition diesel engines, to facilitate enhanced engine performance along with increased engine protection, for more consistent operation and engine longevity.

One characteristic of V-Power diesel is that it is a lot clearer and odourless than normal diesel, mainly due to the synthetic gas to liquid (GTL) component.

The fuel is slightly less dense than regular diesel so, per volume, the unit energy is actually lower than regular diesel. This is offset, as the fuel tends to ignite more readily (and thus has a higher cetane rating) than regular diesel, and a side benefit of this is that it tends to produce less soot during combustion.

Shell also markets a different &quot;premium&quot; diesel in Canada labeled V-Power, which they state &quot;Is specially formulated for year-round Canadian weather conditions, with a cetane improver, a de-icer and a corrosion inhibitor.&quot;. This Canadian V-Power diesel is dispensed from a dedicated pump that injects a measured amount of NEMO 2061 additive into the diesel supply shared with the other diesel pumps at the service station., which would typically be reflected by an increase in cetane rating of 1-2 points, but unlike European V-Power diesel, it contains no GTL components beyond those that may already exist in the shared diesel supply.

Effective June 1, 2012, Pilipinas Shell launches the new premium diesel fuel grade, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel (formerly Shell V-Power Diesel). On June 8, 2017, Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel was renamed back as Shell V-Power Diesel.

==Development in motorsports==
Since 2004, Shell V-Power has been sponsoring Scuderia Ferrari that participates in Formula One. Shell V-Power also sponsored Audi Sport Team Joest factory team until 2009. Since 2016 Shell V-Power has been sponsoring Dick Johnson Racing in the Supercars Championship.

Part of the campaign, especially targeted to sell &quot;V-Power Nitro+&quot; brand of the fuels (higher priced than usual and similar to blend used on the track) is organizing Formula One events in cities without a track. For example, on the streets of Warsaw, Poland, where Scuderia Ferrari driver Felipe Massa drove the race car used in 2013 Formula One Championship.

==In popular culture==
All Shell V-Power fuels are featured in &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot;.

<doc id="849543" wikidata="Q392416" url="?curid=849543" title="Darcy's law">
<text>Darcy&#x27;s law is an equation that describes the flow of a fluid through a porous medium and through a Hele-Shaw cell. The law was formulated by Henry Darcy based on results of experiments on the flow of water through beds of sand, forming the basis of hydrogeology, a branch of earth sciences. It is analogous to Ohm&#x27;s law in electrostatics, linearly relating the volume flow rate of the fluid to the hydraulic head difference (which is often just proportional to the pressure difference) via the hydraulic conductivity. In fact, the Darcy&#x27;s law is a special case of the Stokes equation for the momentum flux, in turn deriving from the momentum Navier–Stokes equation.

== Background ==
Darcy&#x27;s law was first determined experimentally by Darcy, but has since been derived from the Navier–Stokes equations via homogenization methods. It is analogous to Fourier&#x27;s law in the field of heat conduction, Ohm&#x27;s law in the field of electrical networks, and Fick&#x27;s law in diffusion theory.

One application of Darcy&#x27;s law is in the analysis of water flow through an aquifer; Darcy&#x27;s law along with the equation of conservation of mass simplifies to the groundwater flow equation, one of the basic relationships of hydrogeology.

Morris Muskat first refined Darcy&#x27;s equation for a single-phase flow by including viscosity in the single (fluid) phase equation of Darcy. It can be understood that viscous fluids have more difficulty permeating through a porous medium than less viscous fluids. This change made it suitable for researchers in the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results by his colleagues Wyckoff and Botset, Muskat and Meres also generalized Darcy&#x27;s law to cover a multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized multiphase flow equations by Muskat and others provide the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.

== Description ==
In the integral form, Darcy&#x27;s law, as refined by Morris Muskat, in the absence of gravitational forces and in a homogeneously permeable medium, is given by a simple proportionality relationship between the volumetric flow rate formula_1, and the pressure drop formula_2 through a porous medium. The proportionality constant is linked to the permeability formula_3 of the medium, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid formula_4, the given distance formula_5 over which the pressure drop is computed, and the cross-sectional area formula_6, in the form:
formula_7

Note that the ratio:

formula_8

can be defined as the Darcy&#x27;s law hydraulic resistance.

The Darcy&#x27;s law can be generalised to a local form:

where formula_9 is the hydraulic gradient and formula_10 is the volumetric flux which here is called also superficial velocity.
Note that the ratio:

formula_11

can be thought as the Darcy&#x27;s law hydraulic conductivity.

In the (less general) integral form, the volumetric flux and the pressure gradient correspond to the ratios:

formula_12

formula_13.

In case of an anisotropic porous media, the permeability is a second order tensor, and in tensor notation one can write the more general law:

 \mu \partial_j p&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the quantity formula_10, often referred to as the Darcy flux or Darcy velocity, is not the velocity at which the fluid is travelling through the pores. It is the specific discharge, or flux per unit area. The flow velocity () is related to the flux () by the porosity () with the following equation:

: formula_15

The Darcy&#x27;s constitutive equation, for single phase (fluid) flow, is the defining equation for absolute permeability (single phase permeability).

With reference to the diagram to the right, the flow velocity is in SI units formula_16, and since the porosity is a nondimensional number, the Darcy flux formula_10, or discharge per unit area, is also defined in units formula_16; the permeability formula_3 in units formula_20, the dynamic viscosity formula_4 in units formula_22 and the hydraulic gradient is in units formula_23. 

In the integral form, the total pressure drop formula_24 is in units formula_25, and formula_5 is the length of the sample in units formula_27, the Darcy&#x27;s volumetric flow rate formula_1, or discharge, is also defined in units formula_29and the cross-sectional area formula_6 in units formula_20. A number of these parameters are used in alternative definitions below. A negative sign is used in the definition of the flux following the standard physics convention that fluids flow from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. Note that the elevation head must be taken into account if the inlet and outlet are at different elevations. If the change in pressure is negative, then the flow will be in the positive direction. There have been several proposals for a constitutive equation for absolute permeability, and the most famous one is probably the Kozeny equation (also called Kozeny–Carman equation).

By considering the relation for static fluid pressure (Stevin&#x27;s law):

formula_32
one can decline the integral form also into the equation:
formula_33
where ν is the kinematic viscosity.
The corresponding hydraulic conductivity is therefore:

: formula_34

Darcy&#x27;s law is a simple mathematical statement which neatly summarizes several familiar properties that groundwater flowing in aquifers exhibits, including:
* if there is no pressure gradient over a distance, no flow occurs (these are hydrostatic conditions),
* if there is a pressure gradient, flow will occur from high pressure towards low pressure (opposite the direction of increasing gradient — hence the negative sign in Darcy&#x27;s law),
* the greater the pressure gradient (through the same formation material), the greater the discharge rate, and
* the discharge rate of fluid will often be different — through different formation materials (or even through the same material, in a different direction) — even if the same pressure gradient exists in both cases.

A graphical illustration of the use of the steady-state groundwater flow equation (based on Darcy&#x27;s law and the conservation of mass) is in the construction of flownets, to quantify the amount of groundwater flowing under a dam.

Darcy&#x27;s law is only valid for slow, viscous flow; however, most groundwater flow cases fall in this category. Typically any flow with a Reynolds number less than one is clearly laminar, and it would be valid to apply Darcy&#x27;s law. Experimental tests have shown that flow regimes with Reynolds numbers up to 10 may still be Darcian, as in the case of groundwater flow. The Reynolds number (a dimensionless parameter) for porous media flow is typically expressed as

: formula_35

where is the kinematic viscosity of water, is the specific discharge (not the pore velocity — with units of length per time), is a representative grain diameter for the porous media (the standard choice is math|&quot;d&quot;30, which is the 30% passing size from a grain size analysis using sieves — with units of length).

== Derivation ==
For stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, i.e. , the Navier–Stokes equation simplifies to the Stokes equation, which by neglecting the bulk term is:

: formula_36

where is the viscosity, is the velocity in the direction, and is the pressure. Assuming the viscous resisting force is linear with the velocity we may write:

: formula_37

where is the porosity, and is the second order permeability tensor. This gives the velocity in the direction,

: formula_38

which gives Darcy&#x27;s law for the volumetric flux density in the direction,

: formula_39

In isotropic porous media the off-diagonal elements in the permeability tensor are zero, for and the diagonal elements are identical, , and the common form is obtained as below, which enables the determination of the liquid flow velocity by solving a set of equations in a given region.

: formula_40

The above equation is a governing equation for single-phase fluid flow in a porous medium.

== Use in petroleum engineering ==
Another derivation of Darcy&#x27;s law is used extensively in petroleum engineering to determine the flow through permeable media — the most simple of which is for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock formation with a single fluid phase and constant fluid viscosity.

Almost all oil reservoirs have a water zone below the oil leg, and some also have a gas cap above the oil leg. When the reservoir pressure drops due to oil production, water flows into the oil zone from below, and gas flows into the oil zone from above (if the gas cap exists), and we get a simultaneous flow and immiscible mixing of all fluid phases in the oil zone. The oil field operator may also inject water (or gas) to improve oil production. The petroleum industry is, therefore, using a generalized Darcy equation for multiphase flow developed by Muskat et alios. Because Darcy&#x27;s name is so widespread and strongly associated with flow in porous media, the multiphase equation is denoted Darcy&#x27;s law for multiphase flow or generalized Darcy equation (or law) or simply Darcy&#x27;s equation (or law) or flow equation if the context says that the text is discussing the multiphase equation of Muskat. Multiphase flow in oil and gas reservoirs is a comprehensive topic, and one of many articles about this topic is Darcy&#x27;s law for multiphase flow.

== Use in coffee brewing ==
A number of papers have utilized Darcy&#x27;s law to model the physics of brewing in a moka pot, specifically how the hot water percolates through the coffee grinds under pressure, starting with a 2001 paper by Varlamov and Balestrino, and continuing with a 2007 paper by Gianino, a 2008 paper by Navarini et al., and a 2008 paper by W. King. The papers will either take the coffee permeability to be constant as a simplification or will measure change through the brewing process.

== Additional forms ==

=== Differential expression ===

Darcy&#x27;s law can be expressed very generally as:

:formula_41

where q is the volume flux vector of the fluid at a particular point in the medium, &quot;h&quot; is the total hydraulic head, and &quot;K&quot; is the hydraulic conductivity tensor, at that point. The hydraulic conductivity can often be approximated as a scalar. (Note the analogy to Ohm&#x27;s law in electrostatics. The flux vector is analogous to the current density, head is analogous to voltage, and hydraulic conductivity is analogous to electrical conductivity.)

=== Quadratic law ===
For flows in porous media with Reynolds numbers greater than about 1 to 10, inertial effects can also become significant. Sometimes an inertial term is added to the Darcy&#x27;s equation, known as Forchheimer term. This term is able to account for the non-linear behavior of the pressure difference vs flow data.
: formula_42
where the additional term is known as inertial permeability, in units of length formula_27.

The flow in the middle of a sandstone reservoir is so slow that Forchheimer&#x27;s equation is usually not needed, but the gas flow into a gas production well may be high enough to justify using it. In this case, the inflow performance calculations for the well, not the grid cell of the 3D model, are based on the Forchheimer equation. The effect of this is that an additional rate-dependent skin appears in the inflow performance formula.

Some carbonate reservoirs have many fractures, and Darcy&#x27;s equation for multiphase flow is generalized in order to govern both flow in fractures and flow in the matrix (i.e. the traditional porous rock). The irregular surface of the fracture walls and high flow rate in the fractures may justify the use of Forchheimer&#x27;s equation.

=== Correction for gases in fine media (Knudsen diffusion or Klinkenberg effect) ===
For gas flow in small characteristic dimensions (e.g., very fine sand, nanoporous structures etc.), the particle-wall interactions become more frequent, giving rise to additional wall friction (Knudsen friction). For a flow in this region, where both viscous and Knudsen friction are present, a new formulation needs to be used. Knudsen presented a semi-empirical model for flow in transition regime based on his experiments on small capillaries. For a porous medium, the Knudsen equation can be given as

:formula_44

where is the molar flux, is the gas constant, is the temperature, is the effective Knudsen diffusivity of the porous media. The model can also be derived from the first-principle-based binary friction model (BFM). The differential equation of transition flow in porous media based on BFM is given as

: formula_45

This equation is valid for capillaries as well as porous media. The terminology of the Knudsen effect and Knudsen diffusivity is more common in mechanical and chemical engineering. In geological and petrochemical engineering, this effect is known as the Klinkenberg effect. Using the definition of molar flux, the above equation can be rewritten as

: formula_46

This equation can be rearranged into the following equation

: formula_47

Comparing this equation with conventional Darcy&#x27;s law, a new formulation can be given as

: formula_48
where
:formula_49

This is equivalent to the effective permeability formulation proposed by Klinkenberg:

: formula_50

where is known as the Klinkenberg parameter, which depends on the gas and the porous medium structure. This is quite evident if we compare the above formulations. The Klinkenberg parameter is dependent on permeability, Knudsen diffusivity and viscosity (i.e., both gas and porous medium properties).

=== Darcy&#x27;s law for short time scales ===
For very short time scales, a time derivative of flux may be added to Darcy&#x27;s law, which results in valid solutions at very small times (in heat transfer, this is called the modified form of Fourier&#x27;s law),

: formula_51

where is a very small time constant which causes this equation to reduce to the normal form of Darcy&#x27;s law at &quot;normal&quot; times (&gt; nanoseconds). The main reason for doing this is that the regular groundwater flow equation (diffusion equation) leads to singularities at constant head boundaries at very small times. This form is more mathematically rigorous but leads to a hyperbolic groundwater flow equation, which is more difficult to solve and is only useful at very small times, typically out of the realm of practical use.

=== Brinkman form of Darcy&#x27;s law ===
Another extension to the traditional form of Darcy&#x27;s law is the Brinkman term, which is used to account for transitional flow between boundaries (introduced by Brinkman in 1949),

: formula_52

where is an effective viscosity term. This correction term accounts for flow through medium where the grains of the media are porous themselves, but is difficult to use, and is typically neglected.

==Validity of Darcy&#x27;s law==
Darcy&#x27;s law is valid for laminar flow through sediments. In fine-grained sediments, the dimensions of are small; thus, the flow is laminar. Coarse-grained sediments also behave similarly, but in very coarse-grained sediments, the flow may be turbulent. Hence Darcy&#x27;s law is not always valid in such sediments.
For flow through commercial circular pipes, the flow is laminar when the Reynolds number is less than 2000 and turbulent when it is more than 4000, but in some sediments, it has been found that flow is laminar when the value of the Reynolds number is less than 1.

<text>In computing, a file dialog (also called file selector/chooser, file requester, or open and save dialog) is a dialog box-type graphical control element that allows users to choose a file from the file system. They differ from file managers as they are not intended for file management, although some offer simple operations such as folder creation and renaming. Rather they are intended for the opening and saving of files.

Before file dialogs, most programs requested files as a command line argument or as an exact file path. Others required users to select a file from the file manager. A file dialog allows an application to access individual files in a standardized and secure way, with the user in control of what files to share with the application. Mobile phone operating systems lack file selection dialogs. Instead users are expected to give applications control over the whole file system.

There are several types of file dialogs, the two most common being a two-column &quot;view file&quot; dialog and a mini file browser dialog. Others include thumbnail view (for photos) and metadata (for music). There are several reasons for the many varieties of dialogs. First of all there is no single standard design, so a program may implement their own for any purpose. Many GUI toolkits do not provide a file dialog, so an application is forced to use its own.

=== Two-column view ===
The two-column view is one of the primary file dialog types. It uses two columns. One for folders, and another for files. Other common features include the current folder name, a search box and buttons for basic file manipulation.

=== Mini file manager ===
A mini file manager is often used. It represents the normal file manager, but it is restricted in its operations.

=== Thumbnails ===
Usually used by image related applications, a gallery of files are shown which allow a file to be chosen graphically.

== Usability ==
File dialogs have been a subject of much usability debate. As a graphical control element receiving constant use, ease of use is a major factor in their design. The most common reasons for file dialog usability problems include:

* File system limitations,
* Wrong type of dialog for the application (e.g. no thumbnail view in a Wallpaper Selector, As in GNOME 2.6),
* Horizontal scrolling (As in Windows file dialogs),
* Uses non standard terminology (Commonly in ports from other operating systems)

Many widget libraries toolkits such as GTK have been criticized for their lack of it. Early versions of Microsoft Windows also suffered from problems, mainly from the DOS legacy behind it. However, most of these are being addressed as more legacy programs are being converted to use newer, more usable file dialogs.

== Powerbox ==
A file powerbox is a file dialog which dynamically grants the application that opened it the right to access the file that the user chooses.

This means that an application does not have to run with the user&#x27;s full authority. In other words, the application does not have to have the right to access all the user&#x27;s files. An important aspect of the powerbox interface is that it can look to the user just like any other insecure file dialog, but can act to protect the bulk of the user&#x27;s files from potentially untrustworthy software such as Trojan horses or other forms of malware.

With a powerbox system, the file dialog is implemented as a trusted part of the system. It runs in a protection domain separate from the application. The powerbox component has access to all the user&#x27;s files, whereas the application does not.

Apple Mac OS X Lion and later versions of macOS use a powerbox to allow sandboxed applications to open and save files.

<text>Chris Bambery is a Scottish political activist, socialist, author, journalist, TV presenter and producer, most recently with the Islam Channel where he hosts their current affairs programme &quot;The Report&quot;.

Prior to the 2017 UK General Election he was the Parliamentary Assistant to Scottish National Party MP George Kerevan. A leading member of the International Socialist Group, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers Party until 2011 when he resigned from the party.

He is the author of the 2014 book &quot;A People&#x27;s History of Scotland&quot; and was the editor of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; newspaper.

==Political activity==
Bambery is originally from Edinburgh. He was educated at the fee-paying Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College and the University of Edinburgh, where he was Vice President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council.

Bambery began his political career as a member of the International Marxist Group (IMG) in 1972. In 1976, he was one of several Scottish IMG activists who infiltrated the recently-established Scottish Labour Party (SLP), a breakaway from the Labour Party, with the intention of using it to co-ordinate the wider labour movement in fighting &quot;the destruction of the welfare state.&quot; When the SLP&#x27;s leader Jim Sillars expelled a number of activists and branches from the party at its first conference in Stirling in October that year, the IMG &#x27;entrists&#x27; were among those who formed the Scottish Labour Party (Democratic Wing) in response. Bambery was appointed to the new &quot;breakaway-breakaway&quot; party&#x27;s steering committee, but following its collapse soon afterwards he resumed his role as an IMG activist, becoming the group&#x27;s full-time organiser in Glasgow in 1978.

Bambery left the IMG in May 1979, joining the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) seven months later. In 1981, he became the SWP&#x27;s Glasgow organiser. Two years later, he moved to London as an organiser for the SWP, was elected a member of its Central Committee in 1987 and became its National Organiser shortly afterwards, a position which he held until 2004, when he replaced Chris Harman as editor of &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;.

In 2001, he led the International Socialist Tendency at the Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest in Italy with fellow SWP member Alex Callinicos.

After considerable political tension within the SWP regarding the party&#x27;s response to the economic crisis, Bambery made public his resignation letter to SWP National Organiser Charlie Kimber on 11 April 2011. His resignation was joined by 38 other party members, based in Scotland, who shared Bambery&#x27;s analysis that the SWP had retreated from building a political opposition to austerity and the recession along the lines of the highly successful Stop the War Coalition which the SWP was heavily involved with in its first decade.

Following his resignation from the SWP, Bambery was a founding member of the International Socialist Group, an organisation set up by the 39 former SWP members to formulate a united front approach to the recession and to develop a Left argument for Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. During the referendum campaign, Bambery supported the Radical Independence Campaign, and was subsequently a supporter of RISE, the Scottish radical left coalition.

==Books==
In 2014, Bambery&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of Scotland&quot; and his &quot;The Second World War: A Marxist History&quot; were published. A review of the former in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; stated: &quot;In telling the stories of the ordinary footsoldiers in the Radical War of 1820, of the cotton spinners’ strike of 1837 and of the miners’ struggles from 1840 to 1984, in describing the lives of such as Mary Brooksbank and James Connolly, Bambery offers a Scottish version of E. P. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot;&quot; Brian Morton in &quot;The Herald&quot; described its &quot;relentless populism&quot; as &quot;tiresome&quot;, but concluded that it was &quot;pamphleteering of an attractively old-fashioned sort, but on an ambitious scale... It&#x27;s to be hoped that Bambery&#x27;s steady insistence on social justice as a higher political end, above party or nationalism, remains audible.&quot;

In &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, Roger Hutchinson in reviewing the book pointed out:
Reviewing the book in &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, Paul Buhle welcomed it, writing:
Professor John Newsinger, author of &quot;The Blood Never Dried: A People&#x27;s History of the British Empire&quot;, reviewed &quot;The Second World War: A Marxist History&quot; thus:
Some criticism came from those who maintain a loyalty to the former USSR and did not like the depiction of it as fighting the war with Germany for its own, imperialist interests.

In March 2018 &quot;Catalonia Reborn&quot;, co-authored by Chris and George Kerevan, was published by Luath Press, and in August 2018 Verso published a new, updated edition of A People&#x27;s History of Scotland.

Michael Eaude, author of &quot;Catalonia: A Cultural History&quot;, welcomed &quot;Catalonia Reborn&quot;, writing:
Writing about the book in &quot;The National&quot;, Martin Hannan said of it:

&quot;The book is a sustained indictment of the Spanish government’s dealings with Catalonia, made all the more devastating by the detailed factual nature of the work.

Reviewing it in &quot;Planet: The Welsh Internationalist&quot;, Ned Thomas, founder of the Mercator Institute for Media, Languages and Culture at Aberystwyth University, said that
“Past and present are nicely linked through visits to sites of social memory in the Catalan capital… well-researched, well-structured and well-explained.”

The book was welcomed in the House of Commons, where Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams put down an Early Day Motion signed by 11 MPs from Plaid Cymru, the SNP and Labour, stating:

<doc id="849564" wikidata="Q438729" url="?curid=849564" title="There is no alternative">
<text>&quot;There is no alternative&quot; (TINA) is a political slogan originally arguing that liberal capitalism is the only viable system. At the turn of the 21st century the TINA rhetoric became closely tied to neoliberalism, and its traits of liberalization and marketization. Politicians used it to justify policies of economic liberalism (or fiscal conservatism) and austerity. The slogan is strongly associated with the policies and persona of Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party during the 1980s, and, as , with Angela Merkel, who served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 until 2021.

Researchers of populism generally agree that its growth since the 1990s is the result of political elites accepting certain concepts (like free market) as unalterable truths and the associated disappearance of the political discord (so-called post-politics). This created a virtual &quot;party cartel&quot;, where the views of established parties did not differ on policies. A rise in dissatisfaction with these policies coupled with a lack of opposition to them by mainstream parties has led to the rise of new populist parties, such as Alternative for Germany and Viktor Orbán&#x27;s post-2016 version of Fidesz in Hungary.

== Political strategy ==
TINA (as characterized by explicit use of &quot;there is no alternative&quot; and declarations of necessity, inevitability, and irrefutability of certain policies) can be considered a political strategy in both democratic and autocratic regimes. Its rhetoric allows politicians to reduce the scope of available policy choices, limiting the expectations of their electorate and avoiding the blame for bad, but &quot;unescapable&quot; policies. 

TINA allows decisions to appear not as a political choice, but as a matter of adherence to universal truth and common sense. Due to the switch from public deliberations to following the expert opinions, debates are shortened, and therefore input of an individual voter is diminished, so TINA is politically paternalistic. 

On the negative side, applying TINA might create an impression of politicians&#x27; toothlessness, prompting voters to try addressing their grievances outside of the establishment which appears to be not in control and being a hostage to external factors and &quot;disciplinary regimes&quot; of either IMF and World Bank (with their Washington Consensus), or EU Commission.

== History of use ==
=== 19th century ===
Historically, the phrase may be traced to its emphatic use by the 19th-century classical liberal thinker and Social-Darwinist Herbert Spencer in his &quot;Social Statics&quot;. 

=== Thatcher ===
In a speech to the Conservative Women&#x27;s Conference on 21 May 1980, Thatcher appealed to the notion saying, &quot;We have to get our production and our earnings into balance. There&#x27;s no easy popularity in what we are proposing but it is fundamentally sound. Yet I believe people accept there&#x27;s no real alternative.&quot; Later in the speech, she returned to the theme: &quot;What&#x27;s the alternative? To go on as we were before? All that leads to is higher spending. And that means more taxes, more borrowing, higher interest rates more inflation, more unemployment.&quot;

The slogan was often used by Thatcher. The phrase is used to signify Thatcher&#x27;s claim that the market economy is the best, right and only system that works, and that debate about this is over. One critic characterized the meaning of the slogan as: &quot;Globalised capitalism, so called free markets and free trade were the best ways to build wealth, distribute services and grow a society&#x27;s economy. Deregulation&#x27;s good, if not God.&quot; By contrast, Thatcher described her support of markets as flowing from a more basic moral argument; specifically, she argued that the market-principle of choice flows from the moral principle that for human behavior to be moral requires free choice by people.

 notes the curious mix of Thatcher&#x27;s use of neoliberal rhetoric of individual empowerment and the paternalistic tilt of TINA. Although Thatcher became – and remained for many years – a deeply polarizing politician, her legacy in Great Britain carried through both Third Way and New Labour periods, starting a &quot;TINA era&quot;.

=== 2010s austerity ===
Angela Merkel&#x27;s use of the term (literally &quot;alternative-less&quot;; without alternative) in relation to her responses to the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2010 led to the term becoming &quot;un-word of the year&quot;.

In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron resurrected the phrase, stating &quot;If there was another way I would take it. But there is no alternative&quot;—referring to austerity in the United Kingdom. Christine Lagarde, then Managing Director of the IMF, declared in May 2013 that &quot;there is no alternative to austerity&quot;, seconded by France&#x27;s Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault in .

The crisis had exposed a rift between the euro rescue packages and political realities: in 12 out of 15 cases the governments that implemented austerity measures were voted out, Eurosceptic and populist parties enjoyed a quick boost in popularity. In response, Eurozone turned to the &quot;federalism of executive bodies&quot;, pushing the decision authority up to the European Commission, forming diverse coalitions united mostly by the pro-Euro stance of parties, squashing referendum proposals. TINA rhetoric was used as a &quot;shielding mechanism&quot; to depoliticize the discourse, yet it backfired spectacularly in Germany with many voters fleeing to Alternative for Germany in an attempt to re-politicize the euro crisis.

== Criticism ==
Opponents of TINA policies used the phrase in a derisory manner. For instance, cabinet minister Norman St John-Stevas, one of the leading &quot;wets&quot;, nicknamed Thatcher &quot;Tina&quot;, after the acronym TINA. The critic of globalization Susan George coined the opposing slogan &quot;another world is possible&quot; in 2001.

<text>The Wiesel Armoured Weapons Carrier (AWC; ) is a German light air-transportable armoured fighting vehicle, more specifically a lightly armoured weapons carrier, produced by Rheinmetall.

The Wiesel has been used in several of the Bundeswehr&#x27;s missions abroad (UNOSOM II, IFOR, SFOR, KFOR, TFH, ISAF).

==History==
The Wiesel was developed for the West German army to meet a requirement for an air-transportable light armored vehicle for use by its airborne troops, as the infantry of the West German Bundeswehr, especially airborne infantry, were considered unprepared to successfully fight enemy main battle tanks (MBT) in the 1970s. The requirements were that the vehicle should fit in common NATO transport planes and could eventually be air-dropped. It should be able to fight infantry as well as enemy tanks or aircraft. Porsche produced some prototypes of the future fighting vehicle for the Bundeswehr in 1975, but the Bundeswehr stopped the project in 1978 due to lack of funds. Nevertheless, Porsche continued development, because of interest from other countries.

The Bundeswehr eventually ordered 343 of the vehicles in 1985. The &quot;Wiesel&quot; was introduced as a new weapon system for the Bundeswehr with deliveries beginning in the late 1980s. The vehicle was named &quot;Wiesel&quot; (&quot;weasel&quot;) because of its small size and agility, which make it very difficult to detect on the battlefield. Production of the Wiesel 1 ended in 1993. Of 343 Wiesel 1 vehicles, 210 were armed with Raytheon TOW wire-guided anti-tank guided missile system and 133 have the one-man KUKA turret E6-II-A1 armed with the dual-feed Rheinmetall Mk 20 RH-202 20 mm autocannon. Germany deployed both types to Somalia in 1993 as part of the United Nations forces intervention in the Somali Civil War (UNISOM II).

The Wiesel 2 is an enlarged and extended version of the Wiesel 1 with five road wheels instead of four, and a more powerful engine. The Bundeswehr ordered 178 of the new vehicle in various types, including air defense, radar, and anti-aircraft missile launcher, 120 mm mortar carrier, command and fire control, and ambulance variants. The Wiesel 2 entered service in 2001.

The Wiesel 1 MELLS and MK variants were used by German troops of Luftlandebrigade 1 in April 2023 to secure an airfield near Khartoum in support of the German governments evacuation of German citizens from Sudan during the Sudanese Civil War.

==Configuration==

Depending on the exact configuration, the Wiesel 1&#x27;s length is about , height , and width . At only , it weighs less than the armored variant of the U.S. Humvee military light truck. The engine is a 64 kW (86 hp) Audi 2.1-litre diesel engine giving a top speed of 70 km/h (45 mph). The Wiesel can ford deep water and cross a wide trench. It was manufactured by Rheinmetall AG.

The chassis is made of steel armour and can resist common 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm small arms ammunition and shell splinters. Air dropping the vehicle from a plane with parachutes was tested, but was not successful; four test-vehicles were destroyed. Nevertheless, the Wiesel can easily be flown in by transport helicopters, a single CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter can fly in two at once, and common transport planes can carry four or more Wiesel vehicles.

The larger Wiesel 2 has almost twice as much internal volume as its predecessor, and is about long, high (depending on type), and wide. Its weight is approximately in its heaviest configuration.

<doc id="849573" wikidata="Q2943679" url="?curid=849573" title="Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson">
<text>Christopher Birdwood Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson, (13 April 1875 – 5 October 1930), was a British Army officer who went on to serve as a Labour minister and peer. He served as Secretary of State for Air under Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 and between 1929 and 1930, when he was killed in the R101 disaster.

== Early life ==

Born in Nasik (now Nashik) in the Bombay Presidency of India to a military family, Thomson attended Cheltenham College. His father was Major-General David Thompson, R.E., and his mother was the daughter of Major-General Christopher Birdwood; Field Marshal The 1st Baron Birdwood was another grandson of Major-General Birdwood.

== Career ==

=== Military ===

After graduating from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1894, Thomson was commissioned into the Royal Engineers. He served first in Mauritius and then saw action during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), during which he was in command of a field company section and was mentioned in dispatches. He also had his first encounter with aviation when he was detailed to help with the R.E. Balloon Section outside Kimberley. After the war, he became an instructor at the School of Military Engineering at Chatham and then in Sierra Leone. He was promoted to captain and brevet major in 1904, and in 1909 joined the Army Staff College in Camberley. In 1911, he went to the War Office, and in 1912 Thomson was appointed military attaché with the Serbian army during the first and Second Balkan Wars, after which he returned to the War Office in 1913.

During the First World War, Thomson first served at the British Expeditionary Force Headquarters and was Chief Military Interpreter between Sir John French and General Joffre. In 1915 he was sent to Bucharest as military attaché on Kitchener initiative to bring the Kingdom of Romania into the war. But when there he quickly formed the view that an unprepared and ill-armed Romania facing a war on three fronts against Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria would be a liability rather than an asset to the allies. This view was brushed aside by Whitehall, and he signed a Military Convention with Romania on 13 August 1916. By the end of 1916, he had to alleviate the consequences of Romania&#x27;s capitulation, and he supervised the destruction of the Romanian oil wells to deny them to the German Empire.

From 27 August 1917 to 27 May 1918, Thomson served as Commander, Royal Engineers (CRE), of 60th (2/2nd London) Division in Palestine, commanding the divisional engineers in the Battle of Beersheba, the attack on the Sheria position, and the Capture of Jerusalem. He distinguished himself at the Capture of Jericho.

After a distinguished wartime career both behind the lines and at the front, Thomson formed part of the British delegation at the Versailles conference, but condemned the Versailles terms as &quot;containing the seeds of another war.&quot; As in Romania where he followed a policy (of making Romania an ally) with which he did not agree, he found the experience to be profoundly negative.

=== Politics ===
After Versailles Thomson made the decision to enter politics, and joined the Labour Party and Fabian Society. He stood as Labour candidate in two Tory strongholds, Bristol Central in 1922 and St Albans in 1923, but failed to win either seat. In 1924, however, newly elected Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald elevated him to the peerage as Baron Thomson, of Cardington in the County of Bedford. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. He served as Secretary of State for Air in MacDonald&#x27;s first short lived Labour administration of 1924 – interrupting briefly Sir Samuel Hoare&#x27;s seven-year grip on the post. The fall of the government meant that it was not until 1929 that he regained the position, once again serving under MacDonald. In the interim he had maintained his air interests acting as chairman of the Royal Aeronautical Society and the Royal Aero Club, and patron of the Air League.

==Private life==
Lord Thomson was known as Kit to his family and C. B. to his friends. In March 1915, while British military attache in Bucharest, he met the (married) French-Romanian author Princess Marthe Bibesco, and remained devoted to her for the rest of his life. They corresponded regularly. She dedicated four books to &quot;C.B.T.&quot; and visited the site of the R101 accident with their mutual friend, the &quot;Abbé&quot; Mugnier, in December 1930.

== Death ==

His second term in office was cut short by tragedy as Thomson died in the crash of the R101 airship, a government-designed dirigible, on its maiden flight to Karachi in October 1930. The accident, caused partly by pressure put on by Lord Thomson to make the maiden flight before safety checks were complete and adequate flight testing, claimed the lives of 48 people and led to the cancellation of the British airship programme by Thomson&#x27;s successor as air minister, Lord Amulree.

<text>Preston Lea &quot;Trey&quot; Spruance III (born August 14, 1969) is an American composer, producer, and musician who co-founded the experimental rock band Mr. Bungle. He is also leader of the multi-genre outfit Secret Chiefs 3. Originally a guitarist and trumpeter, in the early 90s Spruance began playing vintage electronic organs, analog synthesizers, saz, santur, electric sitar, tar, and various other string and percussion instruments. In the mid 90s he founded Forking Paths Studio where his production techniques were applied to Mr. Bungle and Secret Chiefs 3 records among many others. Since 2007 Spruance&#x27;s Secret Chiefs 3 has been a very active live entity, performing well over 500 shows in more than 50 countries.

Spruance&#x27;s playing and composition style is influenced by many diverse genres of music, such as surf rock, Anatolian folk, death metal, film music, Afghan rebab music, ska, funk, space rock, jazz and Japanoise. Musique concrète and foley work also play a large role in his recordings.

==Career==
Spruance was a founding member of Mr. Bungle, along with Mike Patton and Trevor Dunn. He has focused on his band Secret Chiefs 3 for the last 15 years (though it began in 1996), and its seven &quot;satellite&quot; groups first introduced on the 2004 album &quot;Book of Horizons&quot;. Though once secular, Spruance began exploring religious and philosophical themes in Mr. Bungle and Secret Chiefs 3 in the mid-1990s, after joining the Eastern Orthodox Church. 

In 2013 he arranged his music for the 61-piece Traditional Russian Orchestra of Krasnoyarsk and performed with them in Kansk, Siberia, alongside other members of Secret Chiefs 3. He has performed regularly with John Zorn and has arranged two releases of works from Zorn&#x27;s Masada Songbooks for Secret Chiefs 3: &quot;&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Beriah&quot;. He contributed guitar and tubular bells to two albums by the drone metal band Asva, with whom he toured the US and Europe. He also recorded with Patton and Faith No More on their 1995 album &quot;King for a Day... Fool for a Lifetime&quot;.

In 2016 Spruance composed a three movement string quartet titled &quot;Séraphîta&quot; for San Francisco&#x27;s Kronos Quartet. The piece was premiered by Kronos at the Haydnsaal at Schloss Esterházy in Vienna, and at SFJAZZ Center in the USA. Kronos has also performed the piece at Carnegie Hall and for an engagement with the Alonzo King LINES Ballet. In Australia &quot;Séraphîta&quot; has been performed by the Black Square String Quartet.

==As a producer==
Besides his own bands, Spruance has also worked as a producer for others. In 2020 he produced &quot;Alphaville&quot; for NYC avant garde black metal group Imperial Triumphant, and is currently producing their next record. He produced the album &quot;Death After Life&quot; for Oakland, CA death metal group Impaled. Production duties for other bands include Neil Hamburger, Dengue Fever, The Tuna Helpers, Faxed Head, Tub Ring and many others.

==Record label==
Spruance is the founder of Web of Mimicry, which has released albums from a variety of different bands, including Cleric, Fat32, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Brazzaville, Matt Chamberlain, Dengue Fever, and ASVA, amongst others.

<doc id="849579" wikidata="Q915362" url="?curid=849579" title="Soyuz 32">
<text>Soyuz 32 (, &quot;Union 32&quot;) was a 1979 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the eighth mission to and seventh successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 32 crew was the third long-duration crew to man the space station.

Cosmonauts Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin spent 175 days in space, setting a new space endurance record. Because of the failure of a visiting crew (Soyuz 33) to successfully dock and the resultant decision to send an uncrewed Soyuz craft (Soyuz 34) as a replacement return vehicle, the Soyuz 32 crew had no visitors in the Salyut 6 space station.

==Mission highlights==

===Launch and station activation===

Soyuz 32 was launched with its two-man crew on 25 February 1979. The crew&#x27;s main mission was to overhaul the Salyut 6 space station&#x27;s systems and prepare it for further long-duration crews. They would also attempt a new record duration flight. Soyuz 32 docked with Salyut 6 the next day, and Lyakhov and Ryumin, the third long-duration crew at the station, commenced de-mothballing the facility which had been vacant since November. When the hatch to the station was opened, the cosmonauts smelled burnt steel, a scent Ryumin called the odor of space.

The crew started routine activities and two types of medical exams. The first included daily checks of mood, their accomplishments and food intake. The second checked their psychological condition via observing their frequent communication sessions. Their cardiovascular systems were checked every 8 to 10 days, and their body masses measured. By the second week, they exercised 2.5 hours a day, averaged 3,100 calories of daily food intake with 2.5 litres of water.

The orbit of the station was raised by the Soyuz craft&#x27;s propulsion system 1 March. What the Soviets did not then report was that the Salyut station&#x27;s propulsion system was having problems.

Experiments included hatching quail eggs, but the chicks grew much slower than on Earth, and lacked heads. A videotape recorder was fixed 6 March using a soldering iron, the first time such repair equipment had been used in space.

===Progress 5 arrives===

Progress 5, an uncrewed supply tanker, was launched 12 March and docked with the station two days later. The crew spent four days unloading the vehicle. Supplies delivered included parts for station repair, an extra storage battery, a television monitor, a new Kristall furnace to replace the old one which had broken, a gamma ray telescope and food. A total of 300 items weighing 1,300 kg were delivered. The tanker also delivered 1,000 kg of propellant for the station.

The Soviets revealed the propulsion problem on 16 March. They said a Salyut fuel tank was leaking fuel into the nitrogen bellows which pressurized the fuel. The station&#x27;s engine systems were not affected, but valves and regulators in the pressurization system were at potential risk. Accordingly, the crew shut down the tank and used a reserve tank. The crew attempted to drain the leaking tank by rotating the station and succeeded by 23 March, purged the tank with nitrogen and closed it off.

On the same day they cleared the tank, the crew used the station&#x27;s shower for the first time, wearing scuba masks to keep the water out of their eyes.

A milestone was reached 24 March when the cosmonauts installed a television monitor which allowed a two-way television link with ground control. For the first time, cosmonauts received television pictures in space. Seeing family, instead of just hearing them, was considered to have great psychological importance, especially as longer flights were contemplated.

On 30 March, Progress 5 boosted the station&#x27;s orbit, then Soyuz 32 boosted the orbit again 6 April in preparation for the forthcoming Soyuz 33 crew. Progress 5 was undocked 3 April and deorbited two days later.

===Soyuz 33 mission failure===

Soyuz 33 was launched 10 April with the fourth international crew in the Soviet Intercosmos program. Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov joined commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov as the craft proceeded normally towards the space station. But, as the craft approached to 1,000 metres, the engine failed and shut down after three seconds of a planned six-second burn. Rukavishnikov had to hold the instrument panel as the craft violently shook. A second firing attempt was made, but the engine shut down again, and Ryumin, observing from the station, reported an abnormal lateral glow from behind the Soyuz during the burn. Mission control accordingly aborted the mission and told the crew to prepare to return to Earth. It was the first in-orbit failure of the Soyuz propulsion system.

It was only in 1983 that the Soviets revealed how serious the situation was. The craft had a back-up engine but it was feared that it may have been damaged by the main engine, potentially leaving the crew stranded with five days of supplies while it would take ten days for the orbit to decay. The station could have been moved to within 1,000 m of the craft, but the two craft were drifting apart at 28 metres per second, and time was needed to calculate the manoeuvres. In any event, four crew on the station with one malfunctioning Soyuz and a second Soyuz (Soyuz 32) with a now-questionable engine (it had the same type as Soyuz 33) was not considered the best option.

In the end, the backup engine did fire, though for 25 seconds too long, resulting in an unusually steep trajectory and loads of 10 Gs to be endured by the crew. Rukavishnikov and Ivanov were safely recovered.

===Progress 6, uncrewed Soyuz launched===

The failure of a prestigious international mission was an embarrassment to Soviet authorities and also had a negative effect on the morale of Ryumin and Lyhakov, both of whom had been looking forward to receiving visitors. News of the cancellation of the Soyuz 33 flight was greeted by a series of grunts followed by the termination of all voice communication by the Salyut 6 crew. Their bad mood persisted for several days. After the Soyuz 33 failure, the station crew were stuck with a suspect craft. The Soyuz 33 craft was intended to be swapped for the Soyuz 32, but the failure called into question the reliability of Soyuz 32&#x27;s main engine. Until the design was corrected and a new vehicle launched, the crew was safe on Salyut with the Soyuz usable in an emergency. The fifth international flight, scheduled for 5 June, was postponed.

Lyakhov and Ryumin continued their station activities, including experiments intended to be carried out with the visiting crew (which had been delivered aboard the Progress 5 flight), such as one called Pirin which investigated the formation of metal whiskers on zinc crystals, and another which made multi-spectral measurements of the daylight atmosphere. They were given five days off for the May Day holiday.

Progress 6 was launched 13 May and delivered some 100 items. The Soyuz 33 engine failure did not affect the supply tanker as it differed in its design. Unloading took two days, a new navigational unit was installed, and the tanker raised the station&#x27;s orbit on 22 May. Refueling was completed by 28 May, more orbital adjustments were made 4 and 5 June, and Progress 6 was undocked 8 June.

Soyuz 34, launched uncrewed on 6 June, docked at the just-vacated aft port of the space station on 9 June. The Soyuz had a new engine system, and its successful test flight gave the Salyut 6 crew a reliable return vehicle. Since the craft was uncrewed, some biological samples for experiments were included on the flight.

Soyuz 32 was loaded with 130 kg of replaced instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight equal to that of the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it undocked and returned to Earth uncrewed 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7.

===Progress 7, radio telescope deployed, return to Earth===

Progress 7 was launched 28 June and docked at Salyut 6 two days later. It carried 1,230 kg of supplies including food, plants, mail and a 10-metre diameter radio telescope. The station&#x27;s orbit was raised 3 and 4 July to a 399–411 km orbit, the highest at which a Salyut had operated. This was because no more Progress flights were planned for 1979 and the Salyut&#x27;s propulsion system was suspect, so the decision was to raise the station&#x27;s orbit as high as possible before the crew returned to Earth. Propellant was transferred by 17 July. When the Progress craft undocked, the wire mesh parabolic telescope was unfurled. A camera aboard the tanker beamed the scene to Earth.

The KRT-10 radio telescope was deployed out of the rear docking port, but results proved disappointing and the cosmonauts ejected it on August 9. Trouble happened again when the antenna became snared on the port, forcing the tired cosmonauts to perform an unscheduled space walk on 15 August to cut it loose. Ryumin, attached to a tether, used hand rails to get to the antenna and cut it away. Then he and Lyakhov retrieved a materials experiment left on the station&#x27;s exterior. Because the space walk was so late in the mission, the crew was apprehensive as they were not in the best physical condition to carry it out, so they left letters in the Soyuz return vehicle in case they did not survive.

They packed several experiments in Soyuz 34 and departed the space station 19 August, reentering two days later and landing 170 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. Because the cosmonauts were so weakened from six months in zero gravity (a bouquet of flowers presented to them reportedly felt like &quot;a ton of bricks&quot;), a system of slides and chutes had to be deployed for them to exit the Soyuz descent module. Lyakhov lost 5.5 kg during the flight (Ryumin&#x27;s weight was the same) and both experienced a 20% reduction in lower leg volume. They recovered in seven days, several days faster than expected.

The mission had lasted 175 days, a new endurance record surpassing the 139-day mission by the Soyuz 29 crew in 1978.

==Legacy==
Years later, a similar scenario of crew return was required in 2022. As Soyuz MS-22 was unable to perform crew return due a coolant leak in external radiator, it returned uncrewed with cargo instead of crew like Soyuz 32, and Soyuz MS-23 was launched unmanned with cargo like Soyuz 34 as a replacement to return the crew.

<doc id="849580" wikidata="Q441388" url="?curid=849580" title="Maxim Vengerov">
<text>Maxim Alexandrovich Vengerov (; born 20 August 1974) is a Soviet-born Israeli violinist, violist, and conductor. Classic FM has called him &quot;one of the greatest violinists in the world&quot;.

Vengerov was born in Novosibirsk, the only child of Aleksandr and Larisa Borisovna, an oboist and orphanage children&#x27;s choir director, respectively. He began his musical journey early, singing in his mother&#x27;s choir at the age of three and starting violin lessons at five with Galina Turchaninova. 

At age 10, Vengerov won the 1984 International Karol Lipiński and Henryk Wieniawski Young Violin Player Competition, marking the start of his career. He subsequently studied with Zakhar Bron, following him from the Soviet Union to the Royal Academy of Music in London and then to the Musikhochschule Lübeck in Germany. In 1990, Vengerov won the International Carl Flesch Competition, securing a recording contract with Teldec and launching his international career.

Vengerov moved to Israel with his family in 1990, continuing his studies at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. In 2006, he founded the Musicians of Tomorrow school in northern Israel. His career also includes contributions as a conductor and educator, serving as the first chief conductor of the Menuhin Festival Gstaad Orchestra and holding professorships at institutions like the Royal College of Music in London. He has received numerous awards, including a Grammy and multiple Echo Music Prizes, and plays on the 1727 &quot;ex-Kreutzer&quot; Stradivarius violin.

==Early life==
Vengerov was born in Novosibirsk, the only child of Aleksandr and Larisa Borisovna, oboist and orphanage children&#x27;s choir director respectively, and is Jewish. He sang in his mother&#x27;s choir from the age of three. He began studying the violin at age five with Galina Turchaninova. Upon meeting him, she asked: &quot;Do you have strength in these hands?&quot; The five-year-old punched her in the stomach as hard as he could. He said years later: &quot;Fortunately, she was in a good mood that day, and she accepted me as a student.&quot;

Lessons went badly at first. Turchaninova was very strict. At one point, Vengerov stubbornly refused to play for her for five straight lessons. She told his mother that she was dismissing him as a student. His mother began to cry, and upon seeing that, Vengerov picked up his violin and played 17 assigned pieces from memory without interruption. Even though he had refused to play at his lessons, he had been practicing, with the encouragement of Natalie Gottlieb, a fellow student he has often called his inspiration. Turchaninova agreed to continue his lessons, saying: &quot;Very well. A violinist like Maxim is born only once in a hundred years.&quot;

At age 10, Vengerov won the 1984 International Karol Lipiński and Henryk Wieniawski Young Violin Player Competition in Lublin, Poland. Also that year, he recorded on the Russian label Melodiya, on LP stereo. At age 11, as part of the Tchaikovsky Competition opening concert, he recorded again on LP, but digital. He then went to London, where he recorded his first CD, for Biddulph Records.

For the next five years, Vengerov studied with Zakhar Bron, who in 1987 left the Soviet Union to teach at the Royal Academy of Music in London. When Bron relocated to the Musikhochschule Lübeck in Germany, Vengerov followed. In 1990, Vengerov won the International Carl Flesch Competition, which led to a recording contract with Teldec and the launch of his international career.

==Adult career==
Vengerov moved to Israel with his parents and grandmother in 1990, when he was 16. There, he studied at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. He has said that Israel &quot;is in my genes&quot; and that his &quot;heart and soul belong to Israel.&quot; He goes to Israel whenever it is experiencing a conflict, saying: &quot;I feel I’m a soldier with my rifle in my violin and bow. This tradition is from my predecessors. Isaac Stern used to do the same.&quot; In 1992, Vengerov performed Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 3 at the Salzburg Festival under Trevor Pinnock. In 2006, he founded a music school in the north of Israel, Musicians of Tomorrow, run by a former first violinist of the Israel Philharmonic. He has a home in Migdal, Israel, near Lake Kinneret. He has also played in a number of events commemorating the Holocaust.

In 1997, Vengerov became the first classical musician to be appointed an International Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF, performing for children in Uganda, Thailand, and Kosovo. &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;, an American television production on NBC about Vengerov&#x27;s meetings with young musicians during his master classes, screened at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. He later took a two-year course in Baroque violin performance practice and repertoire. In 2005, he injured his right shoulder in a weightlifting accident, and while he recovered, he developed his interest and skill in conducting. He had surgery on the shoulder and a year of rehabilitation.

In 2010, Vengerov was appointed the first chief conductor of the Menuhin Festival Gstaad Orchestra. He continued his conducting studies with Yuri Simonov, and graduated with a diploma of excellence from the Ippolitov-Ivanov State Musical Pedagogical Institute in 2014. Vengerov then enrolled in a further two-year program of opera conducting. His work with contemporary composers includes premiering Qigang Chen&#x27;s violin concerto &quot;La Joie de la souffrance&quot;.

During 2019–20, Vengerov was artist-in-residence with the Armenian State Symphony Orchestra. He is Ambassador and Visiting Professor at the Menuhin Music Academy in Switzerland (IMMA) and Polonsky Visiting Professor of Violin at the Royal College of Music, London. Aside from teaching, Vengerov has also served on numerous competition juries, including the Donatella Flick Conducting Competition, the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists, and also as chair of the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in 2011 and 2016. In 2013, he conducted the finals of the Montreal International Violin Competition.

<text>Pontiac Township is a defunct charter township in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The area consisted of what is now the cities of Pontiac, Auburn Hills, and Lake Angelus. Pontiac Township was bordered on the north by Brown Road and Dutton Road, on the east by South Adams Road (including a line extending north from South Adams Road), on the south by South Boulevard, and on the west by Telegraph Road. 

==History==
In 1818, Colonel Stephen Mack purchased 1280 acres (5.2 km2) of land that was to become the city of Pontiac. In 1820, Pontiac became the county seat of Oakland County. Pontiac incorporated as a village in 1837 and later as a city in 1861. 

The township was organized as a civil entity in 1827. Under Michigan law, cities are independent of township governance, while villages may continue to receive some services from the township. Thus, as Pontiac grew, it annexed land from the township. 

The village of Auburn was platted in 1826 and was renamed Amy in 1880. In 1917, it was renamed again as Auburn Heights.

Pontiac Township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but the request was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, it formally became the city of Auburn Hills and included Auburn Heights.

Lake Angelus incorporated as a village in 1930 and became a city in 1984. 

Although the township no longer exists as a civil entity, it is still used as a survey township for land use purposes.

<text>Soyuz 33 (, &quot;Union 33&quot;) was an April, 1979, Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the ninth mission to the orbiting facility, but an engine failure forced the mission to be aborted, and the crew had to return to Earth before docking with the station. It was the first failure of a Soyuz engine during orbital operations.

The two-man crew, commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov and Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov, suffered a steep ballistic re-entry, but were safely recovered. The original intention of the mission had been to visit the orbiting crew for about a week and leave a fresh vehicle for the station crew to return to Earth in. The mission failure meant that the orbiting Salyut 6 crew lacked a reliable return vehicle as their Soyuz had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. A subsequent crewed flight was canceled and a vacant craft (Soyuz 34) with a redesigned engine was sent for the crew to use.

==Mission highlights==
After a two-day delay caused by a windstorm at the launch site, Soyuz 33 was launched 10 April 1979 with the fourth international crew in the Soviet Intercosmos program. Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov joined commander Nikolai Rukavishnikov as the craft proceeded normally towards the Salyut 6 space station.

Rukavishnikov was the first civilian to command a Soviet spacecraft, and Ivanov the first Bulgarian in space.

At distance from the station, the Igla automatic docking system was activated. But, as the craft approached to , the engine failed and automatically shut down after three seconds of a planned six-second burn. Rukavishnikov had to hold the instrument panel as the craft shook so violently. After consulting with ground control, the docking system was activated again, but the engine shut down again, and Valery Ryumin, observing from the station, reported an abnormal lateral glow from behind the Soyuz during the burn. Mission control accordingly aborted the mission and told the crew to prepare to return to Earth. It was the first in-orbit failure of the Soyuz propulsion system.

The failure was determined to be a malfunction of the main engine. A pressure sensor in the combustion chamber was shutting down the engine when it seemed normal combustion pressure was not being reached. This shut-down mechanism was designed to prevent propellants from being pumped into a damaged engine thus risking damage or an explosion.

The crew requested another attempt at an engine burn, but were denied and told to sleep. A recovery attempt could not be made for another day. Rukavishnikov could not sleep, however, and thought about the novel &quot;Marooned&quot;, which featured an American space crew stranded in orbit.

It was only in 1983 that the Soviets revealed how serious the situation was. The craft had a backup engine but it was feared that it may have been damaged by the main engine, potentially leaving the crew stranded with five days of supplies while it would take ten days for the orbit to decay. One option to return the crew if the backup engine was inoperable would have been to use attitude control thrusters to slow the Soyuz below orbit velocity, but it was not known if there was enough propellant to do this, and the landing point would have been unpredictable even if it had worked. Another option was to move the station to the Soyuz. The station could have been moved to within 1,000 m of the craft, at which point Soyuz 33 could be docked using its thrusters, but the two craft were drifting apart at , and time was needed to calculate the maneuvers. In any event, four crew on the station with one malfunctioning Soyuz and a second Soyuz (the station crew&#x27;s Soyuz 32, already docked at Salyut 6) with a now-questionable engine (it had the same type as Soyuz 33) was not considered the best option.

The main option was to fire the backup engine, but this option was not guaranteed to work, even if the engine fired. The nominal burn time was 188 seconds, and as long as the burn lasted more than 90 seconds, the crew could manually restart the engine to compensate. But this would mean an inaccurate landing. If the burn was less than 90 seconds, the crew could be stranded in orbit. A burn longer than 188 seconds could result in excessive G-loads on the crew during reentry.

In the end, the backup engine did fire, though for 213 seconds, 25 seconds too long, resulting in the craft taking an unusually steep trajectory and the crew having to endure an acceleration of 10 &quot;g&quot;s. Rukavishnikov and Ivanov were safely recovered. It was the second ballistic entry reported by the Soviets, Soyuz 1 being the first (although Soyuz 18a was a ballistic reentry, and Soyuz 24 reportedly also was one).

The high G-loads during reentry were a mix of crew error and a design flaw in the autopilot; because the backup engine produced less thrust than the main engine, the autopilot tried to run it until the proper delta V was achieved, but the cosmonauts issued a manual shutoff command after 213 seconds of burn time. This unwise decision resulted in a ballistic reentry. This would have caused the Soyuz to land uprange of the planned landing point, but the low delta-V (as the result of the crew manually shutting off the engine early) resulted in the opposite effect and instead, the capsule touched down very close to the target area.

An investigation lasted a month and found that the part that failed had been tested 8,000 times previously without failing, and the Soyuz engine had fired some 2,000 times since 1967, also without a single failure. But the engine was modified for the next flight, and a vacant Soyuz with the newly modified engine, Soyuz 34, was sent to the orbiting Salyut for the crew there to return with.

<text>Route 9 is a major east–west state highway in Massachusetts, United States. Along with U.S. Route 20 (US 20), Route 2, and Interstate 90, Route 9 is one of the major east–west routes of Massachusetts. The western terminus is near the center of the city of Pittsfield. After winding through the small towns along the passes of the Berkshire Mountains, it crosses the college towns of the Pioneer Valley and then south of the Quabbin Reservoir and the rural areas of western Worcester County. Entering the city of Worcester from the southwestern corner of the city, it passes through the center of the city and forms the major commercial thoroughfare through the MetroWest suburbs of Boston, parallel to the Massachusetts Turnpike. Crossing the Route 128 freeway circling Boston, it passes through the inner suburbs of Newton and Brookline along Boylston Street, and enters Boston on Huntington Avenue, before reaching its eastern terminus at Copley Square.

==Route description==
Route 9 passes through six counties and twenty-eight cities and towns.

=== Western end (Pittsfield–Worcester) ===
Route 9 begins in the western Massachusetts city of Pittsfield, at U.S. Route 20. After separating from US-20, it has a brief (.2 mile) concurrency with U.S. Route 7 through the center of that city, then continues east, passing through the towns of Dalton and Windsor, wherein the route reaches its highest point at 2033 ft, in Berkshire County. It continues its winding pass through the small towns of The Berkshires in Berkshire and western Hampshire Counties before passing through the center of Northampton, passing Smith College before its first interstate junction, at Interstate 91. It then crosses the Connecticut River at the Calvin Coolidge Bridge, just downstream from Elwell Island. It goes through the retail area of Hadley before passing the near University of Massachusetts Amherst and by Amherst College. From Amherst, it wends its way into western Worcester County, south of the Quabbin Reservoir, through small towns until it makes its way into the city of Worcester.

=== Through Worcester ===
Once in Worcester, Route 9 becomes a major thoroughfare through the city, as Park Avenue, Highland Street (which passes Major Taylor Boulevard), before passing over Interstate 290 and Belmont Street, where University of Massachusetts Medical School and the former Worcester State Hospital are located. At its intersection with McRae Ct., it becomes a divided highway with raised median, which it will retain until its terminus in Boston with the exception of a brief stretch in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston.

=== In the MetroWest region (Worcester–Wellesley) ===
From Worcester, it crosses Lake Quinsigamond into Shrewsbury. At this point, Route 9 becomes the main retail artery of the MetroWest region. Several plazas and chain stores are located along the route as it makes its way towards Northborough, where it crosses U.S. Route 20; Westborough, where it crosses Interstate 495; and eventually in the Golden Triangle retail area of Framingham and Natick, after crossing the Massachusetts Turnpike. It passes Shopper&#x27;s World and the Natick Mall, New England&#x27;s largest mall.

=== In Greater Boston (Wellesley–Brookline) ===
Beginning in the Golden Triangle, Route 9 becomes one of the major routes into Boston, serving as a valuable bypass to the Mass Pike and its tolls. It crosses Interstate 95 (also known as Massachusetts Route 128) in Wellesley before crossing the Charles River into Newton and Brookline as Boylston Street. It enters the city of Boston by crossing over Brookline&#x27;s former namesake, the Muddy River, part of the Emerald Necklace. At this point it briefly becomes Washington Street, then Huntington Avenue, also known as &quot;Avenue of the Arts&quot;.

=== Eastern end in Boston ===
Route 9 loses its raised median briefly between its intersection with South Huntington Avenue and Brigham Circle. It passes the Longwood Medical and Academic Area, which includes Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, Harvard Medical School and other hospitals; the Museum of Fine Arts; and several colleges and universities, including Northeastern. This stretch is also a major site of baseball history; the first game of the 1903 World Series, baseball&#x27;s first true World Series, was played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds, the original home of the Boston Red Sox. (The site is now part of Northeastern&#x27;s campus.) The E branch of the MBTA Green Line roughly follows Huntington Avenue underground from Copley Square until it rises above ground at the Northeastern portal.

The Green Line E Branch then operates in a dedicated median of Huntington Avenue between Northeastern University and the Brigham Circle stop, where trains begin street running in mixed traffic to a terminus at Heath Street. Route 9 continues past Symphony Hall and The First Church of Christ, Scientist, which is the mother church of Christian Science. It then passes Copley Place and the Prudential Center complex, before splitting, the eastbound half onto Stuart Street, the westbound onto Saint James Avenue, past Copley Square; both the eastbound and westbound segments of Route 9 end at Route 28.

==History==

Route 9 was established in 1933. From its start in 1810 as a toll road from Brookline to Worcester, Route 9 has undergone transformation into a major highway due to the rise of the automobile, especially with the popularity of Henry Ford&#x27;s Model T. It took over the alignment of what was Route 115 from Kenmore Square in Boston to Route 22 in North Grafton, part of the original route of US 20 between North Grafton and West Brookfield and the original Route 109 between West Brookfield and US 7 in Pittsfield. Route 9&#x27;s original route in Boston was along Brookline Avenue from Kenmore Square turning west onto its current path along Boylston Street. Between Worcester and Boston, Route 9 follows the path of the 19th-century Worcester Turnpike, opened in 1810. This route originally included a floating bridge over Lake Quinsigamond in Shrewsbury. From Dalton to Goshen in the Berkshires, the road follows the old Berkshire Trail. The massive expansion of the University of Massachusetts Amherst transformed that part of Route 9 in the late 20th century; this otherwise rural part of the route now has several shops, restaurants, and the mid-sized Hampshire Mall. In the 20th century, Route 9 became the focus for urban sprawl in towns like Newton and Wellesley. Further west, in Framingham, Route 9 was home to one of the first modern shopping malls, the aptly named Shoppers&#x27; World.

In Natick, Route 9 is officially the &quot;Ted Williams Highway&quot;, named after the Red Sox sports legend Ted Williams, who sported that number. In Newton, it is officially the &quot;United Spanish War Veterans Highway&quot;.

From 1903 to 1932, the Boston and Worcester Street Railway ran mostly via modern Route 9. Today the E branch of the MBTA&#x27;s Green Line follows Route 9 along Huntington Avenue.

<text>Charley Varrick (a.k.a.The Last of the Independents and Kill Charley Varrick) is a 1973 American neo-noir crime film directed by Don Siegel and starring Walter Matthau, Andrew Robinson, Joe Don Baker and John Vernon. &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; is based on the novel &quot;The Looters&quot; by John H. Reese, and is the first of four consecutive films in which Matthau appeared that were not comedies (although his role in &quot;Earthquake&quot; is comedic).

==Plot==
Charley Varrick is a crop duster and former stunt pilot with knowledge about explosives. He, his wife, and two others, Al and Harman, rob a bank in rural New Mexico. Al and Charley&#x27;s wife are killed when the crime turns violent. Having gotten away to a distant trailer park, Charley and Harman discover that the heist netted more than three-quarters of a million dollars. When a news outlet reports that less than $2,000 was stolen, Charley correctly concludes that the bank was being used to launder illicit Mafia cash.

Charley tells Harman that the mob will never stop looking for the money, and that their best chance of staying safe is to live their normal lives for the next few years, doing nothing that draws attention to them. Harman tells Charley, however, that he intends to be a spendthrift with his share of the loot. Although mourning his wife&#x27;s death, Charley takes steps to get away. He hides the money and arranges to get passports for him and Harman.

Meanwhile, a Reno-based gangster named Boyle hires a sadistic contract murderer, &quot;Molly&quot;, to find the stolen cash and make an example of the robbers. Molly&#x27;s search leads him to Harman. While Charley is hiding outside of the trailer, Molly torments Harman in an attempt to learn about the money, and beats him to death. Boyle secretly meets with the bank manager, Harold Young. He tells Young that his Mafia superiors will suspect that the robbery was an inside job because it occurred during the brief period when the money was on site. He suggests that Young will be tortured to learn the extent of his involvement. Terrified, Young ends his life.

Charley flies his crop-dusting biplane to Reno and contacts Boyle&#x27;s secretary. She warns Charley not to trust her boss, and they spend the night together. Charley phones Boyle and offers to return the stolen money. He arranges a meeting the next morning at a remote junkyard, and tells Boyle to be there. Molly is with Boyle at the time and comes up with a plan of his own.

Charley lands his plane at the junkyard and, in an effort to fool observers, acts overjoyed and hugs a confounded Boyle. Watching from a distance, Molly assumes that Boyle and Charley have been working together.

Molly runs down Boyle with his car, killing him. Molly chases Charley&#x27;s plane with his car and damages it so that it will not be able to fly. Charley deliberately flips the plane upside down, a stunt that he used to do in his barnstorming days.

Apparently trapped in the wreckage, Charley tells Molly that the money is in the trunk of a nearby car. Molly opens the trunk but sees Harman&#x27;s body and the bank satchels. A moment later, the trunk explodes, killing Molly. Charley frees himself. He throws a wad of $100 bills on the flames of the burning car, gets into another car, and drives away.

==Production==
Director Don Siegel wanted Varrick&#x27;s company&#x27;s motto, &quot;Last of the Independents&quot;, to be the title of the film. The motto appears on the film poster and briefly as a subtitle in the film trailer.

When the hit man Molly arrives at Jewell&#x27;s photo studio and introduces himself, Jewell sarcastically replies, &quot;Yeah, I didn&#x27;t figure you for Clint Eastwood&quot;. The role of Varrick was written specifically for Eastwood, who ultimately turned it down, reportedly because Eastwood decided the character had no redeeming features.

Matthau was also reported to have been unimpressed by the film, and Siegel later claimed that Matthau hurt the film&#x27;s box-office performance by publicly stating that he neither liked the film nor understood what it was about. Matthau sent Siegel a note that said, &quot;I have seen it three times, and am of slightly better than average intelligence (IQ 120) but I still don&#x27;t quite understand what&#x27;s going on. Is there a device we can use to explain to people what they&#x27;re seeing?&quot;

Varrick&#x27;s aircraft is a converted Boeing PT-17 Stearman Kaydet (N53039) crop-duster flown by Hollywood aerial pilot Frank Tallman. The modified crop-duster belonged to a California agricultural spraying business. This same aircraft crashed in Oakdale, California, on December 31, 1976, killing the pilot, who was crop-dusting. The plane&#x27;s wing caught an electric wire and crashed.

===Locations===
Director Don Siegel filmed several of his movies in northern Nevada, including &quot;Charley Varrick&quot;, &quot;The Shootist&quot; and &quot;Jinxed!&quot; &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; was set in New Mexico but was filmed primarily in two small Nevada towns, Dayton and Genoa. Both towns lay a claim to being the oldest towns in the state. The opening bank robbery exterior scenes were filmed in Genoa, at the old Douglas County court house. The sheriff&#x27;s chase of Varrick and his gang was filmed nearby on Genoa Lane and Nevada State Route 207.

The interior bank scenes were filmed in Minden. The trailer park scenes were filmed in Dayton by US Route 50 at the trailer park, located near the Red Hawk Casino, which closed in 2008, and the Carson River, at the corner of Hart and Louie Streets. The photographer&#x27;s studio and gun store scenes were filmed in Gardnerville. The crop-duster flight scenes at the film&#x27;s conclusion were filmed at the now-closed City Auto Wrecking, east of Sparks, near Lockwood Nevada, by Canyon Way Road. The Reno filming locations included a Chinese restaurant formerly located at 538 South Virginia Street and the condominium where Varrick meets Miss Fort at Arlington Towers condominiums, 100 N. Arlington Avenue.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 82% from 28 reviews with the consensus: &quot;With Walter Matthau adding hangdog soul to Don Siegel&#x27;s propulsive direction, &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; is a crime thriller that really scores.&quot;
Although critically very well received, the film was a disappointment at the box office. Reviewer Paul Tatara describes &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; as &quot;intelligent, commercial filmmaking at its finest. They rarely make them like this anymore.&quot;

Vincent Canby, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, considered &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; as both an action film and a mystery:

An intelligent action melodrama is probably one of the most difficult kinds of film to make. Intelligence in this case has nothing to do with being literate, poetic, or even reasonable. It has to do with movement, suspense, and sudden changes in fortune that are plausible enough to entertain without challenging you to question basic premises. If you start asking whether such-and-such could really have happened, or if so-and-so would have acted in a certain way, the action film falls apart.
John Simon at &quot;New York&quot; magazine said that &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; is one of the more accomplished specimens of the gangster genre.

While not strictly a &quot;remake&quot;, &quot;2 Guns&quot; (2013) has many of its film elements lifted from &quot;Charley Varrick.&quot;

==Awards==
Matthau won the 1974 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards for Best Actor in &quot;Charley Varrick&quot;. In addition, Frank Morriss was nominated for the 1974 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards for Best Editing.

==Home media==
&quot;Charley Varrick&quot; was released as a Region 1 DVD with no extras on December 28, 2004. On February 14, 2008, the film was released as a Region 2 DVD in Europe in widescreen with some special features. Both DVD versions are uncut. On March 19, 2015, the film was released as a Region-B locked Blu-ray in Germany. This edition includes a 72-minute documentary on the making of the film, titled &quot;Last of the Independents: Don Siegel and the Making of Charley Varrick&quot;.

On November 12, 2019, the film was released in a Region-A locked Blu-ray by Kino Lorber with an exclusive new 4K remaster. This edition includes the &quot;Last of the Independents&quot; documentary, &quot;Refracted Personae&quot;, a new video essay with critic Howard S Berger, an archival episode of Trailers from Hell, and a new audio commentary with critic Toby Roan.

==Cultural impact==
According to Rory Gallagher&#x27;s long-time bassist Gerry McAvoy, in his book &quot;Riding Shotgun: 35 Years on the Road with Rory Gallagher and ″Nine Below Zero″&quot;, Gallagher&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Last of the Independents&quot; was inspired by &quot;Charley Varrick&quot;. The &quot;Last of The Independents&quot; logo appears in the film on the back of the Varrick company&#x27;s jumpsuits and on his truck.

<doc id="849597" wikidata="Q1991548" url="?curid=849597" title="Elmo's World">
<text>Elmo&#x27;s World is a segment that is shown in the American children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. It always comes last and premiered on November 16, 1998, as part of a broader structural change to the show. It originally lasted fifteen minutes at the end of each episode. The segment ran until 2009, and then returned in 2017. The segment was designed to appeal to younger viewers and to increase ratings, which had fallen in the past decade. The segment is presented from the perspective of a three-year-old child as represented by its host, the Muppet Elmo, performed by Kevin Clash in the original series and Ryan Dillon in the 2017 reboot.

The segment was developed out of a series of workshops that studied changes in the viewing habits of Sesame Street&#x27;s audience, and the reasons for the show&#x27;s lower ratings. &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; used traditional production elements, but had a more sustained narrative. In 2002, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s producers changed the rest of the show to reflect its younger demographic and the increase in their viewers&#x27; sophistication.

Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up with the concept of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, and writer Tony Geiss and executive producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it. In contrast with the realism of the rest of the show, the segment presented Elmo moving between and combining a live action world and a computer-generated animated world, which looked like &quot;a child&#x27;s squiggly crayon drawing come to life&quot;, with &quot;a stream-of-consciousness feel to it&quot;. Elmo&#x27;s pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. A brief clip from &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; appears in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s 2002–2006 intro.

In 2009, &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; went on hiatus. It was replaced by &quot;&quot; in 2012, and returned in 2017. The show is alternated by two more Elmo-centered segments, &quot;Elmo &amp; Tango’s Mysterious Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Nature Explorers&quot;, which are both produced entirely with animation.

==Background==
By the early 1990s, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had been on the air for over 20 years and was, as author Michael Davis put it, &quot;the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television&quot;. The show&#x27;s dominance began to be challenged throughout the decade by other television shows for preschoolers such as &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, and &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, by the growth of the children&#x27;s home video industry, and by the increase of thirty-minute children&#x27;s shows on cable. &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s ratings declined, so the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) (now Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible for putting the show on the air, responded by researching the reasons for their lower ratings.

For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s content and structure, and studied how children&#x27;s viewing habits had changed. The analysis was conducted during a series of two-week-long workshops and was completed in time for the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1999. The CTW found that although the show was produced for children between the ages of three and five, their viewers had become more sophisticated since its debut and began to watch the show sooner, as early as ten months of age. The producers found that the show&#x27;s original format, which consisted of a series of short clips similar to the structure of a magazine, was not necessarily the most effective way to hold young viewers&#x27; attention. They also found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; after 40 to 45 minutes.

The first way the CTW addressed the issues brought up by their research was by lowering the target age for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, from four years to three years. In late 1998, they created a new 15-minute segment entitled &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, hosted by the Muppet Elmo, that was shown at the end of each episode. The segment used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative. &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. It focused on child-centered topics such as balls and dancing, from the perspective of a three-year-old child, and was &quot;designed to foster exploration, imagination, and curiosity&quot;. Instead of an adult providing narration, Elmo led the child through the action.

In 2002, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic and increase in their viewers&#x27; sophistication. They decided, after the show&#x27;s 33rd season, to expand upon the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; concept by, as &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; TV critic Tim Goodman called it, &quot;deconstructing&quot; the show. They changed the structure of the entire show to a more narrative format, making the show easier for young children to navigate. Arlene Sherman, a co-executive producer for 25 years and one of the creators of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, called the show&#x27;s new look &quot;startlingly different&quot;.

==Development and filming==
Long-time &quot;Sesame Street&quot; writer Judy Freudberg came up with the idea of creating a segment with &quot;an entirely different format&quot; from the rest of the show during the CTW&#x27;s workshops, and writer Tony Geiss further developed the idea with her. Freudberg stated that the concept &quot;was radical because we had never veered from that magazine mosaic and had never given any character more than another character to do&quot;.

Animator Mo Willems came up with the idea of creating a less-realistic setting compared to the rest of the show. The segment presented Elmo, first portrayed by Kevin Clash and then by Ryan Dillon after its revamp in 2017, moving between and combining two worlds of live action and computer-generated animation, which looked like &quot;a child&#x27;s squiggly crayon drawing come to life&quot; created by the host, and with &quot;a stream-of-consciousness feel to it&quot;. The segment was filmed at a different time than the rest of the season, much of it in front of a blue screen, with animation and digital effects added later. For more complicated shots that showed Elmo&#x27;s entire body, a puppet called &quot;Active Elmo&quot; was operated with assistance from other puppeteers; the puppet was also filmed in front of a blue screen and edited later. Visual effects for the series were provided by Curious Pictures (1998 to 1999), Protozoa (2000), and Celefex (2001 to 2009).

In addition to Freudberg and Geiss, other writers of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; included Emily Kingsley and Molly Boylan. The theme song was based upon a song Geiss wrote called &quot;Elmo&#x27;s Song&quot;, with lyrics changed to fit the segment. Writer Louise Gikow and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a show within a show&quot;. Clash called it &quot;a playdate between the child and Elmo&quot;, and felt that its intimacy provided an effective teaching tool. He also called it &quot;an instant success&quot;. Davis compared &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; with the Saturday Morning children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

The CTW, as it has done throughout its existence and for all the shows it produced, conducted extensive studies on &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;. They found that the segment had high appeal for children, regardless of their age, sex, and socioeconomic background. Attention and participation such as hand-clapping, moving along with the music, and counting along with the characters increased with repeated viewing.

==Characters==
The Muppet Elmo, who represented the three-year-old child, was chosen as host of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; because he had always tested well with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s younger viewers. Elmo was created in 1979 and was performed by various puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer Kevin Clash called a &quot;phenomenon&quot; until Clash took over the role in 1983. Elmo became, as writer Michael Davis reported, &quot;the embodiment&quot; of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;the marketing wonder of our age&quot; when five million &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; dolls were sold in 1996. Clash believed the &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; segment. Clash called &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; &quot;a colorful, lively celebration of creativity&quot; and &quot;one of the most imaginative endeavors I&#x27;ve ever been involved in&quot;. He stated that the segment provided him with new challenges and opportunities for &quot;creative risk-taking&quot;.

According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo&#x27;s pet goldfish Dorothy and the members of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. Dorothy&#x27;s silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo&#x27;s imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.

Mr. Noodle was played by Broadway actor Bill Irwin, who had previously worked with Sherman in short films for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend Michael Jeter to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle&#x27;s brother Mister Noodle. Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, until his death in 2003. Kristin Chenoweth played Mr. Noodle&#x27;s sister Ms. Noodle, and Sarah Jones played Mr. Noodle&#x27;s other sister Miss Noodle in the episode &quot;Helping&quot;. As of January 2017, Daveed Diggs and comedian Daniel Koren, have played two more of Mr. Noodle&#x27;s brothers. According to Freudberg, &quot;Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he&#x27;s never seen one before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can&#x27;t.&quot;

==End of production and return==
After &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; temporarily wrapped production in 2009, on the tenth and final season, the producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; began taking steps to increase the age of their viewers and to increase their ratings. By the end of the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2009, 3-year-old viewers had increased by 41 percent, 4-year-olds by 4 percent, and 5-year-olds by 21 percent. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, executive producer Carol-Lynn Parente &quot;was itching to revamp the final segment&quot; even before production of &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; ended, but was prevented by the apparent satisfaction of the viewers and by tight budgets. They were also reluctant to replace the segment; as writer Joey Mazzarino explained, it was &quot;an emotionally charged process&quot; because Freudberg had become ill and was not present for the discussions about it.

&quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; was replaced by &quot;Elmo: The Musical&quot; in 2012. &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; continued to appear on repeats of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, on DVDs, and on the show&#x27;s website, which sold products related to the segment. In 2017, the 47th season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; began airing on the cable subscription service HBO; &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; returned, in a newly designed segment that ran five minutes at the end of each episode. Steve Youngwood, the Sesame Workshop&#x27;s CEO, called it &quot;fresh, contemporary&quot;.

<text>Soyuz 34 (, &quot;Union 34&quot;) was a 1979 Soviet uncrewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was sent to supply the resident crew a reliable return vehicle after the previous flight, Soyuz 33, suffered an engine failure.

Mission control decided to re-design the engine used on Soyuz craft as a result of the Soyuz 33 failure, and to return the Soyuz 32 craft which transported Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin to the space station to Earth uncrewed as it had the same suspect engine as Soyuz 33. Soyuz 34 successfully returned the crew to earth 73 days after launching.

==Crew==
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 
*Perigee: 
*Apogee: 
*Inclination: 51.62°
*Period: 88.91 minutes

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz 34 had been intended to have been launched around 6 June 1979 with a two-man Hungarian/Soviet crew. That crew would have presumably returned in Soyuz 33 which had been planned to be docked at the Salyut 6 space station. Suspicions this was originally to be a Hungarian/Soviet flight were confirmed in 1980 when press releases for an upcoming joint mission were still dated June 1979.

However, the engine failure during Soyuz 33&#x27;s flight in April necessitated a shuffling of planned missions. Because the engine used in that flight was the same model already docked at the space station on Soyuz 32 and the resident crew of Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin needed a reliable craft to return to Earth in, it was decided that the engine needed to be modified and a fresh return vehicle sent to the station - vacant.

Soyuz 34 was launched uncrewed on 6 June, and docked at the aft port of the space station on 9 June. The flight itself was a test of the new engine and its success meant the crew had a reliable return craft. Since the craft was uncrewed, some biological samples for experiments were included on the flight.

Soyuz 32 was loaded with 130 kg of replaced instruments, processed materials, exposed film and other items with a total weight equal to that of the two cosmonauts. On 13 June, it undocked and returned to Earth uncrewed 295 km northwest of Dzhezkazgan. The craft was found to be in good condition. The next day, the crew redocked Soyuz 34 at the forward port to clear the aft port for Progress 7, a supply tanker.

On 19 August, the resident crew returned to earth in Soyuz 34, establishing a new space-endurance record of 175 days, surpassing the 139-day mission by the Soyuz 29 crew in 1978.

==Legacy==
Years later, a similar scenario of crew return was required in 2022. As Soyuz MS-22 was unable to perform crew return due a coolant leak in external radiator, it returned uncrewed with cargo instead of crew like Soyuz 32, and Soyuz MS-23 was launched unmanned with cargo like Soyuz 34 as a replacement to return the crew.

<text>UCI Cinemas (&quot;United Cinemas International&quot;) is a brand of cinema, currently operating in Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Brazil, which has been owned since 2004 by Odeon Cinemas Group, whose owner is now AMC Theatres, except for the UCI Cinemas Brazil which also from the same year is owned by National Amusements.

==History==

The organization was announced in October 1988 as a joint venture between United Artists Theaters, United International Pictures (a partnership of Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Universal Pictures), and AMC Theatres, to operate, under the AMC brand, 200 screens in the UK and Ireland with 3 new cinemas opening in Bochum, Bremen and Cologne in West Germany and a further 150 screens planned in the UK and Ireland by 1991. However, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets to the new entity for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market, with the joint venture now known as Cinema International Corp./United Artists Communications Inc. The name was shortened the following year to United Cinemas International and they were based in Manchester, England, operating 86 cinemas initially.

In the UK, the company operated cinemas under the UCI and later Thefilmworks brands, and initially enjoyed a sizeable market share. They took over the first multiplex cinema opened in the UK by AMC at The Point in Milton Keynes in 1985, and were one of the first to purchase a digital projector – costing a massive £130,000 – one out of only 30 worldwide. This enabled them to download films via satellite, and also play digital media disks rather than film. Under chairman Tom McGrath, the group expanded to build and operate cinemas in Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, and the UK.

The cinemas were, by and large, fairly simplistic in design and seemed steeped in 1980s traditions that quickly became dated. However, a later purchase by Terra Firma (see below) saw the chain merged with Odeon cinemas and henceforth adopting the far plusher Odeon style.

In late 2004, the European division of UCI was bought by Terra Firma Capital Partners, along with rival chain Odeon Cinemas. The majority of UK UCI and &quot;thefilmworks&quot; cinemas were rebranded to use the Odeon name. As a condition of the merger with Odeon Cinemas (imposed by the Office of Fair Trading), UCI Clydebank, UCI Poole, UCI Sutton, UCI Basildon, The Empire Leicester Square and thefilmworks High Wycombe were sold to Empire Cinemas. Since the merger has been completed, few elements of former UCI cinemas still retain the UCI look and feel, they now almost all share the standard Odeon design cues, except for a handful of the former &quot;Filmworks&quot; brand whose designs did not lend themselves well to an Odeon &quot;look&quot;. The UCI, UCI/Kinowelt and Cinesa brands will remain in Ireland and the rest of Europe. UCI Hull was evicted at around this time due to redevelopment. As there was already an Odeon there, it was not replaced.

UCI&#x27;s Brazilian branch was acquired, also in 2004, by American conglomerate National Amusements, who also owns the Showcase Cinemas chain. Coca-Cola beverages sold in those cinemas were replaced by Pepsi, coincidentally Showcase&#x27;s beverages. Their biggest cinema in Brazil and the biggest in Brazil, in general, is the New York City Center cinema in Rio de Janeiro, with 18 screens, including IMAX, 4DX, De Lux and XPlus screens. They also have SuperSeats and SuperD seats in select auditoriums throughout Brazil.

Irish cinemas, although retaining the UCI name, were managed as part of Odeon Cinemas and introduced parts of their offer, such as Premier seating and the Odeon in-house magazine, &quot;Onscreen&quot;. Advertising contained the Odeon logo font in many cases. In August 2007, UCI launched a new Irish website with an identical layout to odeon.co.uk. The Irish cinemas were sold to an Irish group, Entertainment Enterprises, in September 2006, but continued to be run by Odeon under a management contract. In April 2008, Entertainment Enterprises announced that it would be acquiring the &quot;Storm Cinemas&quot; chain except the Belfast cinema, and would be contracting the management of the cinemas to Odeon. UCI&#x27;s Tallaght cinema, the first opened in the country, was closed on 8 March 2010 after the landlords gave the company notice that their lease would not be renewed. On 31 May 2011, Odeon announced that it had bought back the UCI chain in Ireland (including the Storm Cinemas-branded locations) from Entertainment Enterprises.

Irish cinemas were rebranded under the Odeon name in 2012 to coincide with the new cinema opening at the Point Village in Dublin, as of the end of 2013 the UCI name is no longer used in any cinemas in the UK &amp; Ireland, all are now branded Odeon.

The Odeon in-house magazine &quot;Onscreen&quot; was rebranded and relaunched as &quot;Odeon&quot; magazine in 2012.

In early 2019, the three cinemas in Austria were sold and rebranded as part of Cineplexx Cinemas.

<text>The Trafford Centre is a large indoor shopping centre and entertainment complex in Stretford, Greater Manchester, England. It opened in 1998 and is third largest in the United Kingdom by retail space.

Originally developed by the Peel Group, the Trafford Centre was sold to Capital Shopping Centres, later to become Intu, in 2011 for £1.65 billion; it set a record as the costliest single property sale in British history.

The battle to obtain permission to build the centre was amongst the longest and most expensive in United Kingdom planning history. , the Trafford Centre had Europe&#x27;s largest food court and the UK&#x27;s busiest cinema.

==History==

===Genesis===

The site was owned by the Manchester Ship Canal Company which John Whittaker&#x27;s Peel Holdings had been acquiring shares in since 1971. Manchester City Council also had a stake, but by the mid 1980s Whittaker had a majority control and proposed building an out-of-town shopping centre, and other schemes.

The council faced a conflict of interest as both a local planning authority and shareholder. Its minority shareholding also no longer gave it any real control over the company. Accordingly, in 1986 it surrendered the right to appoint all but one of the Manchester Ship Canal&#x27;s directors, and sold its shares to Whittaker for £10 million.

Manchester City Council opposed Whittaker&#x27;s proposal for retail development, stating it would impact negatively on the city centre economy, but accepted it was &quot;obviously in the interests of the shareholders&quot;.

The Peel Group submitted a planning application to Trafford Council for development of approximately of land in 1986. The application was called in by the Secretary of State for the Environment and legal disputes ensued requiring two public inquiries before planning permission was granted. Objections included congestion fears on the M60 motorway, and adverse consequences for retailers across Greater Manchester. Planning permission was granted in 1993 before being blocked by the Court of Appeal, then reinstated in 1995 by the House of Lords.

Twelve years after being proposed, the Trafford Centre opened on 10 September 1998. Construction had taken 27 months at a cost of £600 million. The Barton Square and Great Hall extensions opened in 2008, at a combined cost of over £100 million.

===Intu===

Peel Group sold the centre to Capital Shopping Centres (CSC) in January 2011 for £1.6 billion, in cash and shares, and John Whittaker, chairman of Peel Group, became deputy chairman of CSC. He later claimed he could have sold the centre for over £2 billion if he had been prepared to accept just cash. Nevertheless the £1.6 billion deal remained the largest property transaction in British history, and the biggest European property deal of 2011.

Capital Shopping Centres was renamed Intu in 2013 and spent £7 million rebranding the &quot;Intu Trafford Centre&quot;.

, Intu claimed a fair market value of £2.312 billion for the centre. However, the firm entered administration in June 2020 and the centre was placed into receivership by its creditors in November 2020. In 2020, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who had loaned Intu £250 million in 2017, exercised their rights as creditors to take ownership of the complex.

===Post Intu===

Construction of the Manchester Metrolink&#x27;s Trafford Park tram line began construction in January 2017. Test trams began in November 2019, and the line opened from Pomona tram stop to intu Trafford Centre on 22 March 2020. &quot;intu Trafford Centre&quot; tram stop had to be renamed to &quot;The Trafford Centre&quot; in late 2020 after intu ceased ownership.

==Building==
John Whittaker chose a lavish, unorthodox style seeking to avoid the centre rapidly appearing dated and stale, a problem many shopping centres were susceptible to. Although the extravagant Rococo and Baroque design may be viewed as gaudy, he argued the prospect of the shopping centre rapidly ageing was mitigated and long-term less renovation work would be required.

The design was a collaboration between the architectural practices of Chapman Taylor and Manchester-based Leach Rhodes Walker. Main contractor was Bovis, with structural engineering services provided by WSP Group. Such was the size and detailing of the building, architects ended up producing over 3,000 separate shop drawings and the construction process required 24 chartered architects to work on the project full-time to monitor progress.

Peel Avenue, Regent Crescent, the Dome, and The Orient, comprising the original centre were designed so that visitor flows split equally between their two floors. The 20-screen Odeon Cinema and other leisure facilities are in the Dome area on the third floor, with the infrastructure for an additional fourth floor built ready during the initial construction.

There was a originally a market-style area at the end of Peel Avenue called Festival Village, playing host to a range of children&#x27;s entertainment, independent retailers and restaurants. It was eventually closed in late 2003 to make way for a John Lewis store, which opened in May 2005. Many of the Village&#x27;s entertainment and retailers were dispersed throughout the centre thereafter.

There are three domed atria along the length of the mall, and the developers claim its £5 million middle dome is larger than that of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Decor===

The Trafford Centre also contains eclectic Art Deco and Egyptian Revival elements. It is decorated primarily in shades of white, pink and gold with ivory, jade and caramel coloured marble throughout.

 there were or £5.8 million of Tuscan marble and granite flooring from Montignoso and Quarrata, and gold leaf adorns the building&#x27;s columns. The marble floors and handrails are polished nightly to maintain the centre&#x27;s opulence.

The Trafford Centre has decorative features such as red roses of Lancaster which pay homage to the local area and North West England. Griffin statues adorn the exterior, the heraldic symbol of the de Trafford baronets who historically owned much of the land in modern-day Trafford.

Elsewhere, fake palm trees and neo-classical decorative pillars made of painted, medium-density fibreboard have received criticism. Manchester architecture critic John Parkinson-Bailey described the Trafford Centre as a building which &quot;will not appeal to purists&quot; and the range of interior architecture as &quot;bewildering&quot;.

Portraits around the walls of the mall depict members of the Whittaker family. A Mercedes car formerly belonging to John Whittaker&#x27;s mother was initially displayed on the first floor mall outside but is now in Trafford Palazzo.

===Sculpture===

A feature of the centre, and particularly Trafford Palazzo, is the statuary, fountains and other sculpture. There are over 100 figures, mainly in a classical Greek / Roman, or Art Nouveau style.

Altrincham sculptor Colin Spofforth created bronze figures of a jazz band for the New Orleans theme, and the crest, above the main entrance. The latter assembles a griffin, unicorn and Roman centurion, once more referencing the arms of the de Trafford family. The centurion holds two lightning bolts, a reminder of the power stations formerly on the site.
===The Orient===
The Orient is Europe&#x27;s largest food court with 1,600 seats and 35 retail outlets. It is decorated in the style of a 1930s ocean liner, incorporating detail representing China, New Orleans, Egypt, Italy, americana and Morocco. The two floors incorporate restaurants, bars and fast food outlets in sight of a giant screen.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall opened 2007, its glazed structure housing five restaurants and cafes. Construction took 18 months at a cost of £26 million and incorporates a sweeping staircase with marble balustrades. The centre claims its Great Hall has the largest chandelier in the world at wide and high. The feature incorporates three internal maintenance walkways and weighs five ton.

===Trafford Palazzo (formerly Barton Square)===

The , covered Trafford Palazzo (formerly Barton Square) opened in 2008 and cost £70 million. The former name referenced the nearby Barton-upon-Irwell.

Trafford Palazzo is linked to the main Trafford Centre by a glazed bridge and incorporates a mock Italian Renaissance square with fountain and campanile tower. 

A £75 million 110,000 sq ft renovation for the area commenced in mid 2018, which included adding a first floor and a roof. Over time, the offering shifted from home stores to a more leisurely offering with some retail such as Primark who opened in June 2020, and Sports Direct.

===Leisure===
Leisure facilities include a 20-screen Odeon cinema; Laser Quest arena; an adventure golf course; an amusement arcade with dodgems and bowling, and a Sea Life Centre aquarium. Between 2002 and 2004, the area occupied by Paradise Island Adventure Golf was originally home to an interactive children&#x27;s ride called Dreamieland, dubbed &quot;Britain&#x27;s first shopping centre-based theme ride&quot;. It closed after only two years due to poor attendance, before Paradise Island took its place in 2008.

==Transport==

, 10 percent of the UK population lived within a 45-minute drive of the Trafford Centre. 

===Buses===
There is a bus station at the west end of the Trafford Centre, with services to most towns in Greater Manchester.

===Road===
The Trafford Centre has 12,500 car spaces and 350 coach spaces; it is sited off the M60, at junctions 9 and 10. Its popularity has resulted in traffic congestion on the M60&#x27;s Barton High-Level Bridge, requiring a link road adjacent to the M60 crossing the ship canal on a new lift bridge.

All vehicles entering the centre have number plate details recorded via automatic number plate recognition. Since its introduction in 2003 at a cost of £220,000, the system has reduced the number of thefts of and from vehicles to a level described as &quot;negligible&quot;. The ANPR tracks cars which have been used for serious offences and details of any car with such a number plate can then be passed to Stretford Police station.

===Trams===
The centre is served by two stops on the Trafford Park Line of the Manchester Metrolink network. The terminus, The Trafford Centre tram stop, serves the west of the centre, while the Barton Dock Road tram stop serves the east of the centre and Trafford Palazzo.

From 1998 to 2020, a shuttle bus had connected Stretford tram stop and the Trafford Centre.

<text>Michael Hartnett () (18 September 1941 – 13 October 1999) was an Irish poet who wrote in both English and Irish. He was one of the most significant voices in late 20th-century Irish writing and has been called &quot;Munster&#x27;s de facto poet laureate&quot;.

==Early life and background==
Michael Harnett was born in Croom Hospital, County Limerick. Although his parents&#x27; name was Harnett, he was registered in error as Hartnett on his birth certificate. In later life he declined to change this as his legal name was closer to the Irish Ó hAirtnéide. He grew up in the Maiden Street area of Newcastle West, County Limerick, spending much of his time with his grandmother Bridget Halpin, who resided in the townland of Camas, in the countryside nearby. Hartnett claimed that his grandmother was one of the last native speakers to live in County Limerick, though she was originally from north Kerry. He claims that, although she spoke to him mainly in English, he would listen to her conversing with her friends in Irish, and as such, he was quite unaware of the imbalances between English and Irish, since he experienced the free interchange of both languages. When he began school, he claims that he was made aware of the tensions between both languages, and was surprised to discover that Irish was considered an endangered language, taught as a contrived, rule-laden code, with little of the literary attraction which it held for him. He was educated in the local national and secondary schools in Newcastle West. Hartnett emigrated to England the day after he finished his secondary education and went to work as a tea boy on a building site in London.

==Early writings==
Hartnett had started writing by this time and his work came to the attention of the poet John Jordan, who was professor of English at University College Dublin. Jordan invited Hartnett to attend the university for a year. While back in Dublin, Hartnett co-edited the literary magazine &quot;Arena&quot; with James Liddy. He also worked as curator of Joyce&#x27;s tower at Sandycove for a time. He returned briefly to London, where he met Rosemary Grantley on 16 May 1965, and they were married on 4 April 1966. His first book, &quot;Anatomy of a Cliché&quot;, a book of love poetry dedicated to his wife was published in 1968 to critical acclaim and was the beginning of his serious writing life and he returned to live permanently in Dublin that same year.

He worked as a night telephonist at the telephone exchange on Exchequer Street. He now entered a productive relationship with New Writers Press, run by Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. They published his next three books. The first of these was a translation from the Irish, &quot;The Old Hag of Beare&quot; (1969), followed by &quot;Selected Poems&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tao&quot; (1972). This last book was a version of the Chinese &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. His &quot;Gypsy Ballads&quot; (1973), a translation of the &quot;Romancero Gitano&quot; of Federico García Lorca was published by the Goldsmith Press.

==A Farewell to English==
In 1974 Hartnett decided to leave Dublin to return to his rural roots, as well as deepen his relationship with the Irish language. He went to live in Templeglantine, five miles from Newcastle West, and worked for a time as a lecturer in creative writing at Thomond College of Education, Limerick. Also, in 1974, he first won both the Irish American Literature Award and the Arts Council Award in the same year. Then in 1975, he made the great and bold political statement that he was going to no longer write in English but that he was going to &quot;court the language of his people&quot; with the publication of A Farewell to English. A number of volumes in Irish followed: &quot;Adharca Broic&quot; (1978), &quot;An Phurgóid&quot; (1983) and &quot;Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn&quot; (1984). He received the Irish-American Cultural Institute Award in 1980, and the Irish Arts Council Award for the best book in Irish in 1986. 
A biography on this period of Michael Hartnett&#x27;s life entitled &#x27;A Rebel Act Michael Hartnett&#x27;s Farewell To English&#x27; by Pat Walsh was published in 2012 by Mercier Press.

==Later life and works==
In 1984 he returned to Dublin to live in the suburb of Inchicore. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of &quot;Inchicore Haiku&quot;, a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including &quot;A Necklace of Wrens&quot; (1987), &quot;Poems to Younger Women&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Killing of Dreams&quot; (1992). These critically acclaimed works contributed to his winning the Irish American Cultural Institute Award in 1988, and the American-Ireland Fund Literary Award in 1990. Selected and New Poems (1994) was published both in Ireland and the USA.

He also continued working in Irish, and produced a sequence of important volumes of translation of classic works into English. These included &quot;Ó Bruadair, Selected Poems of Dáibhí Ó Bruadair&quot; (1985) and &quot;Ó Rathaille The Poems of Aodhaghán Ó Rathaille&quot; (1999). His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in two volumes in 1984 and 1987 and &quot;New and Selected Poems&quot; in 1995. In 1999, the documentary film on his life and work: Michael Hartnett: Necklace of Wrens, was widely shown on Irish television to critical acclaim and won several prizes. Also, during the late 1990s, his poetry was added to the Irish final secondary school exam, the Leaving Certificate

Seamus Heaney has written that he is &quot;one of the truest, most tested and beloved voices in Irish poetry in our time.&quot; 

Hartnett died from Alcoholic Liver Disease in October 1999 following a stroke in Listowel and after repeated visits to the hospital over the years. He is buried in Newcastle West.

The Collected Poems, A Book of Strays and Translations were published in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively by Gallery Press.

==Éigse Michael Hartnett==
Every October a literary and arts festival is held in Newcastle West in honour of Michael Hartnett. Events are organised throughout the town and a memorial lecture is given by a distinguished guest. Former speakers include Nuala O&#x27;Faolain, Paul Durcan, David Whyte and Fintan O&#x27;Toole. The annual Michael Hartnett Poetry Award of 4000 euro also forms part of the festival. Funded by the Limerick City and County Council Arts Office and the Arts Council of Ireland, it is intended to support and encourage poets in the furtherance of their writing endeavours. Previous winners include Sinéad Morrissey and Peter Sirr.

During the 2011 Éigse, Paul Durcan unveiled a bronze life-sized statue of Michael Hartnett sculpted by Rory Breslin, in the Square, Newcastle West. Hartnett&#x27;s son Niall spoke at the unveiling ceremony.

==Family life==
Michael and Rosemary had a daughter Lara who lives in Australia and a son Niall who lives in Ireland. Niall manages the writer&#x27;s estate and copyright in conjunction with Gallery Press.

<text>Shopper&#x27;s World is an open-air shopping center in Framingham, Massachusetts. The original facility (spelled Shoppers&#x27; World) is of historical significance as one of the first suburban shopping malls in the United States upon opening in 1951; though it had a central courtyard and covered walkways, it was not fully indoor. The original structure was demolished and replaced by the current open-air facility in 1994. The retail park, with the adjacent Natick Mall in Natick, are major components of the Golden Triangle shopping district in the center of MetroWest, situated between Route 9 and Route 30.

==History and layout==

One of the earliest suburban shopping malls in the United States, Shoppers&#x27; World (spelled with an apostrophe and possessive &quot;s&quot; in the plural form) opened on October 4, 1951 with 44 stores, 25,000 people, and State Treasurer John E. Hurley present. This futuristic concept mall was designed to be the mecca of suburban shopping between Boston and Worcester, as the area around its original property remains today.

At the time the term &quot;mall&quot; was not yet in use as a term for an enclosed shopping center, but articles about the center spoke of its &quot;mall&quot;, in the original sense of &quot;promenade&quot; or &quot;walkway&quot;, along which the stores were arranged.

The large Jordan Marsh dome on the southern end was the sole anchor store for the mall in the earliest days. The dome was visible from the air and was used on aeronautical charts as a visual reporting point for aircraft approaching Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport. It was reputed to be the third largest (in diameter) unsupported dome in the world after St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome and St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

There were two long, flanking two-level wings separated by a two-story open courtyard mall surrounded by large, open parking lots.

The original design included a multipurpose theater at one end of the mall. Originally called The Cinema, the house contained a large orchestra seating section, a balcony, and a full stage with a fly area for curtain, scenery, and lighting grid. Early stage crews at The Cinema are credited with coining the now-standard industry term Best Boy to describe an assistant to the chief electrician. In addition to movies, in the 1950s the theater was the site of many live summer theater productions such as Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and George Abbott and John Cecil Holm&#x27;s &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot;. It was the first movie theater in the country to take advantage of the mall parking lots to provide ample parking during evening hours. In later years, The Cinema became strictly a movie house under the ownership of General Cinema. The Cinema would add a second theater in 1963, and two more in 1974. In the mid-1970s, the first two auditoriums were split in half, bringing the Cinema to a total of 6 screens.

As the mall grew, it eventually took the shape of many newer malls but remained roofless.

The mall&#x27;s layout consisted of a two-level, open-middle, long rectangle shape. However, by having no main roof over the central mall area, customers had to walk outside to get from store to store. To keep people from getting wet in the rain and snow, the mall management covered the perimeter walkways by extending the roof line of the stores all the way around the mall. The lower walkway was covered by the top walkway. To walk between levels, shoppers used three large , wide, paved, covered ramps placed so customers were never too far from one. Kids often ran up and down them (away from consenting parents) as well as rode bikes and skateboards.

Throughout the years, the courtyard area always had several areas of interest and events going on. The southern end contained a permanent water fountain with synchronized colored lights and a garden area with seasonal plantings of flowers, picnic tables, and sun umbrellas. In the 1950s, several kiddie rides including a small Ferris wheel, merry-go-round, and a boat ride were in the north end of the courtyard. In 1961, a Stop &amp; Shop grocery store was built at the northwest side of the mall. The store was eventually replaced in the late 1970s by a Toys &#x27;R Us, which remained a tenant until the entire chain was shuttered in 2018.

During the holidays, the mall put up decorations that included several giant wooden soldiers around the inner concourse, and artistic flower arrangements and banners. Santa Claus appeared with live reindeer in the courtyard in front of Jordan Marsh Basement Store every Christmas. In the early 1950s, an Easter egg hunt was held, but the practice was abandoned after children searching for the hidden candy eggs tore up shrubbery and landscape in their search.

Other zoo animals and many special attractions, like Flipper and spaceship rides, were displayed throughout the year. Automotive events, such as autocross racing and motorcycle riding school took place in the parking lot. In the 1980s, the gazebo area was constructed where the kiddie rides once were. Ragtime and brass bands played regularly by the gazebo in the 1980s and 1990s. Shoppers&#x27; World was the first shopping center to have a musical water fountain show, a feature famously used by The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles. The &quot;Dancing Waters&quot; attraction was based on the fountains at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair and was programmed to music and colored lights. There was also a train/tram that brought customers around the mall.

In 1967, the Jordan Marsh Basement Store was built at the north end of the mall. Jordan Marsh&#x27;s original main store, located on the south end, had a remote underground entry point in the middle of the parking lot near the bus stop. Shoppers could enter a small enclosure and walk down two flights of stairs to arrive in the lower level of the Jordan Marsh store. Jordan Marsh also had a separate tire store that stood alone across the street on the west side of the mall.

The large yellow smokestack on the outer west side originally had &quot;Sears&quot; written on it but was removed when the store moved to the newer Natick Mall in 1965.

==Replacement==
While the mall had enjoyed several decades of success from shoppers and retailers alike, the overall facility was beginning to show its age by the early 1980s. Aside from the additions of the Stop &amp; Shop and Jordan Marsh Basement Store anchors, the original mall itself had changed very little since opening in 1951.

In 1983, Shopper&#x27;s World was sold to Melvin Simon and Robert Campeau, who proposed to replace it with a new enclosed, multi-floor structure with four anchor stores. Construction on the new Shopper&#x27;s World was slated to begin in late 1980s. However, Robert Campeau&#x27;s Campeau Corporation went bankrupt before plans could be finalized and the expansion begun. Adding to this, a series of lawsuits over the nature of the project between Simon and Campeau delayed development plans. In 1992, the mall was sold to the Sears real estate division, Homart Development Company. Homart, who also purchased the adjacent Natick Mall property, canceled the expansion plans for both mall complexes and developed two new concepts for a completely rebuilt, enclosed mall on the larger Shopper&#x27;s World property and a power center at the Natick Mall location.

However, one of the major tenants, Filene&#x27;s, had completely remodeled and expanded its Natick location as part of the former Natick Mall expansion plans and was unwilling to spend more capital on constructing a new building at Shopper&#x27;s World. In response, Homart reversed the plans and developed the concepts that became the new Natick Mall and Shoppers&#x27; World. The original mall&#x27;s tenants were moved into the Shopper&#x27;s World complex in 1993, and the mall torn down. A new, modern two-story Natick mall with over 200 stores was built and opened in late 1994. After tenants were moved to the new Natick Mall, the original Shopper&#x27;s World closed in August, 1994, and demolition occurred in the following months.

The new Shopper&#x27;s World was reopened as a modern, U-shaped power center in 1995. The new Shopper&#x27;s World (the possessive &quot;s&quot; was changed to the singular form), a strip mall that features of retail space. Stores include Best Buy, John Harvard&#x27;s Brew House, Starbucks, Barnes &amp; Noble, Chipotle, The Paper Store, Nordstrom Rack, and many others.

The center is also home to the first HomeSense in the United States and opened alongside Sierra Trading Post in August 2017, replacing a Sports Authority store.

On January 24, 2018, it was announced that Toys &quot;R&quot; Us&#x27; sister store, Babies &quot;R&quot; Us would be closing as part of a plan to close 182 Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and/or Babies &quot;R&quot; Us stores nationwide due to bankruptcy. The Babies &quot;R&quot; Us store closed in April 2018. On March 14, 2018, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us announced that they would be closing all 1,795 locations Worldwide, including the Shopper&#x27;s World Toys &quot;R&quot; Us location. The store closed on June 27, 2018. Toy City moved in place in September.

On November 25, 2019, It was announced that A.C. Moore will be closing all 145 stores, including the one at Shoppers World in Framingham.

According to a news article from October 30, 2020 John Harvard&#x27;s Brew House has permanently closed.

On January 10, 2022, it was announced that a new grocery store would replace the Barnes &amp; Noble and Old Navy stores.

In October 2022, outdoor specialty retailer Public Lands opened in the former Bob&#x27;s Store location. 

On November 2, 2023, Shopper&#x27;s World was acquired by Urban Edge Properties.

<text>Antonio Esteve Ródenas or Antonio Gades (14 November 1936 – 20 July 2004) was a Spanish flamenco dancer and choreographer. He helped to popularize the art form on the international stage.

<text>Soyuz 35 (, &quot;Union 35&quot;) was a 1980 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the 10th mission to and eighth successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 35 crew were the fourth long-duration crew to man the space station.

Cosmonauts Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin spent 185 days in space, setting a new space endurance record. Ryumin had completed a previous mission only eight months before. They hosted four visiting crews, including the first Hungarian, Cuban and Vietnamese cosmonauts.

As long-duration crews now routinely swapped spacecraft with incoming crew, the Soyuz 35 craft was used to return the visiting Soyuz 36 crew to Earth, while the resident crew returned in Soyuz 37.

==Crew launch, station activation==

Soyuz 35 was launched 9 April 1980 with Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin aboard for a planned rendezvous with the orbiting Salyut 6 space station. The launch followed increased recent activity with the uncrewed space station. An uncrewed test craft, Soyuz T-1, spent several months docked to the station until it was undocked 23 March and deorbited 25 March. Progress 8, an uncrewed supply tanker, was launched almost immediately afterwards, on 27 March, and it docked with the rear dock port of the two-dock facility. Several manoeuvres were carried out by 2 April using the Progress to adjust the station&#x27;s orbit.

Valentin Lebedev had been scheduled to be Popov&#x27;s flight engineer, but he was disqualified from launch after suffering a knee injury in a trampoline accident. As none of the back-up crew had previous flight experience (required since the failure of the Soyuz 25 mission), Ryumin had been given the choice of replacing Lebedev or delaying the mission. This despite having completed a six-month mission only the previous August. Ryumin&#x27;s family was upset by this turn of events.

The Soyuz 35 crew docked with and entered the space station on 10 April, using the vacant front port. Ryumin read the traditional note left by the previous crew, a note he had written with no expectation he would be the one receiving it. With Salyut 6 now entering its fourth year in orbit, some signs of wear and tear were becoming evident. Ryumin noted that the two viewports in the transfer compartment had lost their transparency. The windows also had many chips in them caused by micrometeoroids and orbital debris. The cosmonauts replaced components of the attitude control system and life support system, installed a new caution and warning system, synchronized the station&#x27;s clocks with those in the TsUP Mission Control Center, added an storage battery, and used Progress 8 to refill the life support system&#x27;s oxygen and nitrogen tanks.

On 15 April, Progress 8&#x27;s mission was completed. The crew loaded it with garbage, after which it was undocked and deorbited three days later. Then Progress 9 was launched, docking with the facility on 29 April. The next day, the first-ever transfer of water between a tanker and a Salyut station was completed. Cargo transfers and refuelling operations were completed by 12 May. With this flight, the resupply of the Salyut was complete for the long-duration crew.

Minor repair work was carried out by the crew and &quot;Lotos&quot; was carried out, an experiment involving using special moulds to make plastic items with a quick-setting material. Additional experiments involved production of polyurethane foam, exploring its utility in assembling structures in orbit.

==Soyuz 36 and Soyuz T-2 crews visit==

Progress 9 was undocked 20 May, leaving the rear port vacant for the arrival of the next crew. Soyuz 36 was launched 26 May with Valery Kubasov and Hungarian cosmonaut Bertalan Farkas. The flight was originally scheduled for 5 June 1979, but was cancelled due to the Soyuz 33 failure. The launch was a part of the Soviet Intercosmos program whereby guest cosmonauts from allied nations would visit the space station, typically for about a week. Upon boarding, the visiting crew carried out some Hungarian experiments, including one measuring radiation doses received by the crew and another studying the formation of interferon in human cells under weightless conditions.

Kubasov and Farkas returned to Earth in Soyuz 35, leaving the resident crew with the fresh Soyuz 36, which they then flew around to the front port of Salyut 6, a maneuver taking about 90 minutes. The rapid switch of ferry vehicles, along with the launch of Soyuz 36 at almost the earliest possible date to allow a crew recovery in the nominal window, caused observers to speculate the secretive Soviets were possibly planning a second Intercosmos mission to recoup the time lost after the Soyuz 33 failure. A launch indeed was soon in the offing, but not the predicted mission.

Soyuz T-2 was launched 5 June with Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov on what turned out to be the first crewed mission of the new Soyuz T variant. The craft docked at Salyut 6&#x27;s rear port the next day. As they were merely testing the Soyuz, the mission lasted just two days after which they departed and returned to Earth.

The resident crew carried out repairs of the station&#x27;s Kaskad attitude control system and performed materials processing experiments. On 1 July, Popov and Ryumin received Progress 10 at the station. Replacement equipment was unloaded from the supply tanker, as were regular crew supplies. Supplies included a Polaroid camera, a color television monitor, and tapes of Soviet pop music. The tanker was undocked from the complex on 17 July after refuelling the station and deorbited 19 July. Also on July 19, Popov and Ryumin sent their greetings from the station to the 1980 Summer Olympics, wishing the athletes happy starts in a live communication between the station and the Central Lenin Stadium where the opening ceremony was held. They appeared on the stadium&#x27;s scoreboard and their voices were translated via loud speakers.

==First Asian and Cuban cosmonauts, end of mission==

Observers anticipated a Cuban Intercosmos mission for the approaching launch window, but were proven wrong when the first Asian cosmonaut, Pham Tuan of Vietnam, was launched aboard Soyuz 37 with Viktor Gorbatko on 23 July. The launch was timed to take advantage of the world&#x27;s focus on the Soviet Union during the Olympic games. The visiting crew swapped craft and left on the docked Soyuz 36 craft, returning to Earth on 31 July.

Pham Tuan&#x27;s flight also had political implications as he was a decorated flying ace from the Vietnam War and had shot down several American aircraft, a fact that the Soviet media readily pointed out. The mission was interpreted as a subtle means of retaliation against the United States for boycotting the Olympics.

The following day, Popov and Ryumin boarded Soyuz 37 and redocked it to the front port, suggesting to observers that another crew&#x27;s launch was coming shortly. That was not to occur, nor was another Progress supply tanker soon launched. The crew performed a joint experiment with scientists on the ground, using their Yelena-F gamma ray telescope. The experiment was designed to compare measurements with another telescope on the ground, but the weather balloon the experiment was using malfunctioned and thieves stole much of the equipment before ground crews could locate it.

The next landing window was now 2–15 October, suggesting the anticipated Cuban launch would be 24 September, but observers were caught off guard once again when Soyuz 38 was launched 18 September, almost a week earlier than anticipated.

Cuban Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, the first space-farer of African descent, was accompanied by Yuri Romanenko into space, the fourth crew to visit the resident crew. The early launch date was intended to allow Cubans to be able to see their countryman overhead. Twenty-seven material processing and medical experiments were carried out by the visiting crew. As the Soyuz 35 crew were returning to Earth soon, the Soyuz 38 crew didn&#x27;t swap their craft when they returned on 26 September.

The launch, therefore, of Progress 11 on 28 September came as surprise to observers, as it was assumed cosmonauts due to return to Earth would not need fresh supplies. Indeed, by the time the Soyuz 35 crew returned on 11 October, the Progress was only partially unloaded. In fact the real purpose of Progress 11 was to boost Salyut 6 into a higher orbit during the six months between crew residencies, since its defective propulsion system could no longer be used. The crew set a new space endurance mark of 185 days, but the record was not recognized by the IAF as it had not exceeded the previous 175-day record by the required minimum of 10 per cent. Ryumin had become by far the most experienced space-farer to that date, with a total of 352 days spent in space over three missions. Unusually, the crew had gained an average of 2 kg during the flight. This was explained by the crew&#x27;s strict adherence to exercises and diet. By the day after landing, they were able to walk for half an hour. By 15 October, they were playing tennis. Thousands of Earth resources photographs were taken, as were more than 40,000 spectrograms. The fourth Salyut 6 residency was at last a complete success after the numerous technical malfunctions that dogged the first three crews.

<text>A mastiff is a large and powerful type of dog. Mastiffs are among the largest dogs, and typically have a short coat, a long low-set tail and large feet; the skull is large and bulky, the muzzle broad and short (brachycephalic) and the ears drooping and pendant-shaped. European and Asian records dating back 3,000 years show dogs of the mastiff type. Mastiffs have historically been guard dogs, protecting homes and property, although throughout history they have been used as hunting dogs, war dogs and for blood sports, such as fighting each other and other animals, including bulls, bears and even lions.

==History==
Historical and archaeological evidence suggests that mastiffs have long been distinct in both form and function from the similarly large livestock guardian dogs from which they were most likely developed; they also form separate genetic populations. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale and some kennel clubs group the two types together as molossoid dogs; some modern livestock guardian breeds, such as the Pyrenean Mastiff, the Spanish Mastiff and the Tibetan Mastiff, and an extinct draught dog called the Belgian Mastiff, have the word &quot;mastiff&quot; in their name, but are not considered true mastiffs. 

Many older English sources refer to mastiffs as bandogs or bandogges, although technically the term &quot;bandog&quot; meant a dog that was tethered by a chain (or &quot;bande&quot;) that would be released at night; the terms &quot;mastiff&quot; and &quot;bandog&quot; were often used interchangeably. One of the most famous &quot;bandog&quot; programs in England, led to the establishment of a recognized &quot;bandog&quot; breed known today as the Bull Mastiff. The least common &quot;bandog&quot; program in England was funded by Sir Nathanael Dieu-est-Mon&#x27;plaisir, the St. Louis Vincent Mastiff or South American Mastiff was named after Vincent Louis who reared plantation dogs originating from St. Louis and other parts of South America. This rare breed is the most expensive mastiff-type dog amongst the &quot;bandog&quot; breeds. In the twentieth century the term &quot;bandog&quot; was revived to describe some large fighting mastiff type dogs crossed with any bulldog in the United States.

<text>Soyuz 36 (, &quot;Union 36&quot;) was a 1980 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the 11th mission to and ninth successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz 36 crew were the first to visit the long-duration Soyuz 35 resident crew.

Soyuz 36 carried Valery Kubasov and Bertalan Farkas, the first Hungarian cosmonaut, into space. They swapped Soyuz craft with the long-duration crew and returned to Earth in Soyuz 35; a later crew used their craft to return to Earth.

==Mission highlights==
Soyuz 36 was launched on 26 May 1980 with Valery Kubasov and Hungarian cosmonaut Bertalan Farkas, headed to the Salyut 6 space station where Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin, launched aboard Soyuz 35, were resident. The flight was originally scheduled for 5 June 1979, but was cancelled due to the Soyuz 33 failure. They successfully docked at the aft port the day after launching. The flight was the fifth Intercosmos flight whereby guest cosmonauts from Soviet allied nations would visit the space station, typically for about a week. The flight was only the second time a Soviet mission had a civilian commander.

Upon boarding, the visiting crew carried out Hungarian experiments, so many that the visiting crew sometimes only got three hours of sleep. One experiment was Pille, which measured radiation doses received by the crew with miniature thermoluminescent devices attached to their clothing and to the walls of the station. Another three experiments studied the formation of interferon in human cells under weightless conditions. Earth resources work using the on-board cameras were carried out, in coordination with ground crews, airplanes and helicopters.

Farkas was said by the Hungarian press to have adjusted far quicker than Kubasov to the weightless conditions.

The Soyuz craft was used to boost the station&#x27;s orbit on 29 May, then Kubasov and Farkas swapped Soyuz craft with the long-duration crew, exchanging seat liners, pressure suits and personal items, before departing the station in Soyuz 35 on 3 June and landed 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The Soyuz 36 spacecraft was later used to return the crew of Soyuz 37 to earth.

<text>Édgar Enrique Rentería Herazo (; born August 7, 1975), nicknamed &quot;the Barranquilla Baby&quot;, is a Colombian former professional baseball shortstop. He threw and batted right-handed. He played for the Florida Marlins, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves, Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants, and Cincinnati Reds.

Born in Barranquilla, Colombia, Rentería was signed by the Florida Marlins in 1992. He debuted with them in 1996, and he finished second to Todd Hollandsworth in Rookie of the Year Award balloting. In 1997, his RBI single off Charles Nagy in the eleventh inning of Game 7 of the 1997 World Series won the first World Series in Marlins&#x27; history over the Cleveland Indians. In the 2010 World Series against the Texas Rangers, Rentería won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award with the San Francisco Giants after he hit game-winning home runs in Game 2 and Game 5.

==Early years==
Rentería was born on August 7, 1975, in Barranquilla, Colombia. As a youth, he attended Instituto Los Alpes High School in Barranquilla. After high school, he was signed by the Florida Marlins at the age of sixteen by scout Levy Ochoa.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Rentería started his professional career in 1992 with the Gulf Coast League Marlins. He had a .288 batting average and 47 hits in 43 games that year. However, his fielding percentage was only .897, and he made 24 errors. In 1993, he played for the Kane County Cougars of the Midwest League. He only batted .203 in 116 games with them, but he only committed 34 errors that year, and his fielding percentage increased to .934.

In 1994, Rentería was promoted to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League. His average went up to .253 and his fielding percentage climbed to .959. 1995 saw Rentería have a breakout season with the Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League. He batted .289 with the team, and he hit seven home runs and stole thirty bases. Entering the 1996 season, Baseball America ranked Rentería as the best prospect in the Marlins&#x27; organization. He started the season with the Charlotte Knights of the International League, and he batted .278 with two home runs and fifteen runs batted in in 28 games with them.

===Florida Marlins (1996–1998)===
====1996====
On May 9, Rentería was called up to the Marlins following an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4–2 win over the Colorado Rockies, when he entered the game in the ninth inning as part of a double switch. He did not have any at bats in that game, though, and he was just a backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Rentería replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3–2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game for the first time on June 10 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3–2 loss. 

Rentería did so well as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Rentería strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in . Rentería finished the season with a .309 batting average, 68 runs scored, and sixteen stolen bases in 106 games. He was second behind Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award balloting.

====1997====
In 1997, Rentería hit the first inside-the-park home run of his career to tie a game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 5, and he won the game 4–3 with an RBI single in the eleventh inning. On April 27, he had a game–winning single in the ninth inning that gave the Marlins a 4–3 win over the Dodgers. From May 13 to 29, he had a thirteen-game hitting streak. From July 16 through July 18, he had three hits in three straight games. On August 15, his RBI single in the ninth inning gave the Marlins a 6–5 victory over Pittsburgh. Rentería finished the season with a .277 batting average, 171 hits, and 32 stolen bases in 154 games. That year, the Florida Marlins won the wild card to advance to the playoffs for the first time in their history. 

In Game 1 of the 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), Rentería&#x27;s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth off Roberto Hernández gave the Marlins a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The Marlins swept the Giants in the series and defeated the Atlanta Braves in the 1997 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to face the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. In Game 7, with the score tied at two and two out in the eleventh inning, Rentería hit a walk-off RBI single off Charles Nagy to score Craig Counsell. The hit won the game 3–2 and won the first World Series in Marlins&#x27; history.

====1998====
In 1998, Rentería had a .302 batting average by the All-Star break, and he was the only Marlin selected to the MLB All-Star Game. His RBI single in the eleventh inning on May 1 gave the Marlins a 6–5 victory over the San Diego Padres. He had a fourteen-game hitting streak from June 8 to 22, which was the longest by a Marlin in 1998. During the streak, on June 9, he had his first career pinch hit when he singled home Dave Berg in the ninth inning to give the Marlins a 5–4 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. Also, on June 14, he scored the winning run in a 5–4 win over the New York Mets. For his contributions from June 8 through 14, he won the NL Player of the Week Award. 

On July 13, he scored four runs (which tied a Florida record) in an 8–7 win over the Expos. On August 24, he sprained his right knee sliding into second base in the third inning of a 7–4 loss to San Francisco. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he was reactivated on September 9. He finished the year with a .282 batting average and 146 hits in 133 games, along with a career-high 41 stolen bases. On December 14, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Armando Almanza, Braden Looper, and Pablo Ozuna.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1999–2004)===

====1999====
On May 16, Rentería hit his first home run as a Cardinal off Ismael Valdes of the Dodgers in a 5–4 victory. He had three RBI, including the game-winner, on May 23 in an 8–3 victory over Los Angeles. He had two home runs on May 31 in a 5–2 win over Florida. On June 12, he had three hits, including a game–winning single in the fourteenth inning, in an 8–7 victory over the Detroit Tigers. From June 21 to July 1 he had a ten-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. On July 9, he had four hits in a 5–4 loss to the Giants. He had four hits again on August 31 in an 8–1 victory over the Marlins. On September 5, he stole four bases in a 13–9 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit ten home runs in a season for the first time when he homered on September 10 in an 11–5 win over Pittsburgh. Rentería finished the season with a .275 batting average. He led the Cardinals with 154 games, 585 at-bats, 161 hits, 36 doubles, and 37 stolen bases (which was also the seventh most in the National League).

====2000====
In 2000, Rentería had a .273 average by the All–Star break, and he was selected to the All-Star Game to replace teammate Mark McGwire, who was injured. He homered in three straight games from April 9–11, and he set a new career high on the eleventh with four RBI in a 10–6 victory over the Houston Astros. On April 16, he reached base five times in a 14–13 loss to Colorado. On August 29, he hit his sixteenth home run of the year in a 3–1 loss to the Marlins. The home run broke Solly Hemus&#x27;s record for most home runs by a Cardinals&#x27; shortstop. On September 4, his three-run triple gave the Cardinals a 4–2 win over the Expos. 

He finished the season with a .278 batting average and 156 hits in 150 games. He led the Cardinals with 21 stolen bases, and his 76 RBI were the second most by a Cardinals&#x27; shortstop (in 1921 Doc Lavan had 82). His 76 RBI were also second only to Jim Edmonds&#x27;s 108 that season, and he led the team with 32 doubles. He also won the National League&#x27;s Silver Slugger Award for a shortstop. The Cardinals made the playoffs and swept the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, but they were defeated in five games by the New York Mets in the NLCS.

====2001====
On April 4, 2001, Rentería went three-for-five and hit a 432-foot home run off Denny Neagle in a 13–9 loss to Colorado at Coors Field. On April 18, he walked and scored the winning run on a wild pitch by Randy Johnson in a 3–1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had a pinch hit single on May 10 against Pittsburgh that provided the winning run in an 11–5 victory. His RBI single off John Rocker of Cleveland on July 8 gave the Cardinals a 4–3 victory. However, his batting average was only .226 by July 26. Rentería batted .299 in his last 58 games, though, to raise his batting average to .260 by the end of the season. During those games, Rentería had a ten-game hitting streak from August 8 to 17. Rentería finished the season with seventeen stolen bases, which led the Cardinals. In Game 3 of the 2001 NLDS, Rentería hit his first playoff home run, off Brian Anderson of Arizona, in a 5–3 loss. However, the Diamondbacks defeated the Cardinals in five games on their way to winning the World Series.

====2002====
Rentería enjoyed a better season in 2002. On April 10, he had three hits (including a game-tying single in the ninth inning) in a 6–5 win over Milwaukee. On May 6, he hit his first home run since August 20 of the previous year in a 6–5 loss to the Cubs. Four days later, he hit a game-winning home run off Cincinnati&#x27;s closer Danny Graves in a 4–2 victory. On June 27, he hit his nineteenth double, which tied his 2001 season total. He got his one thousandth hit on July 26 off Jon Lieber of the Cubs in an 8–4 victory. Two nights later against the Cubs, he hit a three-run game-winning home run to cap off a six-run ninth inning by the Cardinals that won the game 10–9. Two nights after that, he hit two home runs in a 5–0 victory over the Marlins. On August 18, he hit his first career grand slam to lift the Cardinals to a 5–1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit another grand slam on September 4 and had a career-high five RBI in a 10–5 victory over Cincinnati. He finished the season with a .305 batting average and 166 hits, and he won his second Silver Slugger Award. By the time Rentería reached the age of 25, he had accumulated 1,061 hits, the 17th highest total for a 25-year-old in MLB history. He also won his first Gold Glove Award, and he became the first Cardinals&#x27; shortstop to win a Gold Glove Award since Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith won one in 1992. Rentería only batted .194 in the playoffs, but the Cardinals made it all the way to the NLCS, where they were beaten by San Francisco in five games.

====2003====
On April 13, 2003, Rentería hit two home runs and had five RBI in an 11–8 victory over Houston. He had four RBI on April 29, in a 13–3 victory over the New York Mets. He got five hits in a game for the first time on June 12, in an 8–7 victory over the Boston Red Sox. The next day, Roger Clemens of the New York Yankees struck out Rentería for his four thousandth strikeout on the way to winning his three hundredth game as the Yankees beat the Cardinals 5–2. Rentería was selected to the All–Star Game after he had a .331 batting average by the break, and he became the first Cardinals&#x27; player since Delino DeShields in 1997 to have twenty stolen bases before the All–Star break. On September 18, he had four hits and five RBI in a 13–0 win over Milwaukee. He won his second Player of the Week Award after he had twelve runs batted in from September 15 to 21. On September 27, the final game of the season, Rentería became the first NL shortstop since Hubie Brooks in 1985 (and the first Cardinals&#x27; shortstop) to have one hundred RBI in a season when he had the game-winning RBI in a 3–2 win over Arizona. He finished the year fourth in the NL in stolen bases (34) and batting average (a career-high .330), and he won a Silver Slugger Award after setting career highs in hits (194) and doubles (47, which set a Cardinal single-season record for doubles by a shortstop, besting Dick Groat&#x27;s 43 in 1963). He also won a Gold Glove Award, and he became the first Cardinals&#x27; shortstop to win Silver Slugger Awards and Gold Glove Awards in back-to-back years.

====2004====
On April 10, 2004, Rentería had four hits in a 10–2 victory over Arizona. On June 9, against Mark Prior, he hit his third career grand slam in a 12–4 victory over the Cubs. He had a ten-game hitting streak, his best of the year, from June 22 to July 3. During the streak, on June 26 against the Kansas City Royals, his RBI single in the tenth inning gave the Cardinals a 3–1 victory. Also, on July 2, he scored four runs in an 11–2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. He was one of three Cardinals selected to the All-Star Game. He had four hits again on July 15 in a 7–2 win over Cincinnati. On August 8, he had five hits in a 6–2 win over the Mets. He had five RBI on August 22 in an 11–4 victory over Pittsburgh. Rentería finished the year with a .287 batting average, and he had ten home runs, 72 RBI, and 84 runs. The Cardinals made the World Series that year, but they were swept by Boston. Rentería was the final batter of a World Series for the second time in his career, when he grounded out against Keith Foulke to end Game 4 as the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, ending the Curse of the Bambino. Fox commentator Joe Buck famously called Rentería&#x27;s grounder with:

However, he was one of only three Cardinals position players to bat above .250 in the Series as he batted .333. Following the year, he became a free agent.

===Boston Red Sox (2005)===
On December 19, 2004, the Boston Red Sox signed Rentería to a four-year, $40 million contract with an option for 2009 to replace free agent Orlando Cabrera at shortstop. On April 14, 2005, he hit his first home run with the Red Sox off Randy Johnson of the Yankees. His double in the eighth inning of that game was the game winner in an 8–5 victory for Boston. From May 26 to 29, he had four straight games with at least three hits, the longest streak since George Brett had six (the record) in 1976. During that stretch, on May 28, 2005, he went three for three with a grand slam and five RBI in a 17–1 victory over the Yankees. The next day, he had four hits, including a home run, in a 7–2 victory over New York. For his efforts that week, he won his third career Player of the Week Award. He set a new career high for hits in a month when he had forty hits in August, second in the major leagues. He had a game-winning single on September 24, 2005 off B. J. Ryan of the Baltimore Orioles in a 4–3 victory. The win moved the Red Sox into a tie with the Yankees for the AL East lead. He scored one hundred runs in a season for the first time when he scored both runs in a 7–2 loss to Toronto on September 28. He finished the year with a .276 batting average and 172 hits. He struggled defensively, though, as he led the major leagues with a career-high 30 errors, and Red Sox fans soon began booing him after he only batted .228 in April. Rentería batted only .231 in the 2005 ALDS as the Red Sox would lose the division series to the Chicago White Sox in just three games. The Red Sox were also disappointed with his performance, and on December 8 he was traded to the Atlanta Braves for prospect Andy Marte.

===Atlanta Braves (2006–2007)===
Rentería started 2006 with a 23-game hitting streak (counting the final game of 2005, it was 24 games). The 23-game streak in 2006 was the second longest that year and the longest to open the season since Ron LeFlore started 1976 with a thirty-game streak. He missed nine games after straining his rib cage on April 15 against San Diego, but he was not placed on the disabled list. On May 8, he had four hits and hit two home runs for the first time since 2003 in a 13–12 win over the Cubs. On July 3, he hit his one hundredth career home run off Anthony Reyes in a 6–3 victory over St. Louis. He was selected to the 2006 All-Star Game after he batted .318 with nine home runs in the first half of the season. On August 17, he had his first hit in 24 at-bats in a 5–0 win over the Washington Nationals. He finished the year with a .293 batting average, fourteen home runs, and seventy RBI. His defense also flourished, as he only committed thirteen errors.

On Opening Day (April 2) in 2007, Rentería hit two home runs (including the game-winning one in the tenth) in a 5–3 victory over Philadelphia. He became the third Atlanta Brave to hit two home runs on Opening Day, joining Fred McGriff and Joe Torre. From April 20 to May 12, he had an eighteen-game hitting streak, which was the longest by a Brave in 2007. During the streak, he had four hits for the twentieth time in his career on April 27 in a 9–7 victory over Colorado. On May 15, he hit two home runs in a 6–2 win over the Nationals. He had four hits on May 30 in a 9–3 win over the Brewers. He had five hits for the first time since 2004 on June 16 in a 6–2 victory over the Indians. On August 3, he was placed on the disabled list for the first time since 1998 after he sprained his ankle the previous day. Rentería returned on August 22, but he returned to the DL a day later when he re-injured his ankle after facing only one pitch. He was activated again on September 7, and he returned to the Braves&#x27; lineup the next day. He finished the year with a .332 batting average (tied for third in the NL and a new career high), twelve home runs, and 57 RBI. He was one of only four major league shortstops in 2007 to bat over .300 with over ten home runs and fifty RBI (the others were Derek Jeter, Hanley Ramírez, and Miguel Tejada). However, because of the emergence of shortstop prospect Yunel Escobar, Rentería was traded to the Detroit Tigers on October 29 for Jair Jurrjens and Gorkys Hernández.

===Detroit Tigers (2008)===

On April 16, 2008, Rentería hit his fifth career grand slam and had five RBI in a 13–2 victory over the Indians. He had four hits on April 22 in a 10–2 win over the Rangers. He had four hits again and five RBI in a 12–8 victory over Seattle on May 20. He hit his sixth career grand slam on June 7 in an 8–4 victory over the Indians. On June 17, he had his two thousandth hit (off Jonathan Sánchez) in a 5–1 victory over San Francisco. He finished the year with a .270 batting average, 136 hits, and ten home runs. After the season, the Tigers declined his option on October 30, and they chose not to offer arbitration on December 1, which made him a free agent.

===San Francisco Giants (2009-2010)===

====2009====
On December 4, 2008, Rentería signed a two-year, $18.5 million deal with the San Francisco Giants with an option for 2011. He had five RBIs and became the first player to hit a grand slam off Jake Peavy in an 8–3 victory over San Diego on April 21, 2009. On April 29, he had four hits in a 9–4 victory over the Dodgers. He tied an eventual 7–4 loss to the Mets on May 14 with a single in the eighth inning, but he strained a hamstring advancing to first base and had to leave the game with an injury. He missed six games with the injury before he returned to the lineup on May 22. From May 8 through June 6, despite batting only .250, he reached base safely in twenty straight games. He had a game-winning grand slam on August 30, which gave the Giants a 9–5 win over Colorado. He missed nineteen of the final twenty games of the season with biceps tendonitis and a sprained AC joint, and on September 26 he had surgery to remove bone spurs and chips from his right elbow. Dealing with injuries all year, Rentería finished the season with a career-low .250 batting average and only 115 hits and 48 RBI.

====2010====
On April 7, 2010, Rentería had five hits (in five at-bats) in a 10–4 victory over Houston. He started the season well, as he was batting .320 through April 30. However, on April 30, he was forced to leave a game against Colorado after two innings with an injured groin. After missing four games, he returned to the lineup on May 6, but he left that game after two innings when he reinjured the groin. He was placed on the disabled list the next day. He was activated from the DL on May 22, but, after three games, he strained a hamstring on May 25 and was placed on the disabled list again the next day. He returned to the Giants on June 19. However, he returned to the disabled list on August 11 with a biceps injury received the previous night. He returned to the Giants on September 1, but Giants&#x27; manager Bruce Bochy announced that Juan Uribe, who had been playing well while substituting for Rentería at short, would remain the starting shortstop, which made Rentería a reserve player. He had four hits on September 16, in a 10–2 win over the Dodgers. On September 23, with the Giants trailing San Diego in the NL West, Rentería delivered a speech during a team meeting in which he told his teammates it could be his last year, and he wanted the Giants to make the playoffs. The Giants managed to overtake San Diego, and they did make the playoffs. Rentería finished the year with career-lows in games (72), hits (67), home runs (three, tied with his 1998 total), and RBI (22). During the season, he also began contemplating retirement.

====2010 postseason====
In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería reclaimed a starting role when he started four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants&#x27; 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single in the eighth inning as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres that he was going to hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit a three-run home run off Rangers&#x27; pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, $1 million contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.

===Cincinnati Reds (2011)===
On January 7, 2011, Rentería signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds worth $2.1 million plus another $900,000 in performance bonuses. He began the season as a utility player, since Paul Janish began the year at shortstop. Through 2011, he led all active major league shortstops in career errors, with 272.

In 2012, he received interest and offers from multiple teams, including the Milwaukee Brewers, but teams were told that he &quot;intends to remain retired.&quot;

===Retirement===
On March 22, 2013, Rentería formally retired from Major League Baseball.

===Career Statistics===
In 2,152 games over 16 seasons, Rentería posted a .286 batting average (2,327-for-8,142) with 1,200 runs, 436 doubles, 29 triples, 140 home runs, 923 RBI, 294 stolen bases, 718 bases on balls, .343 on-base percentage and .398 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .970 fielding percentage. In 66 postseason games, he hit .252 (61-for-242) with 37 runs, 12 doubles, 3 home runs, 23 RBI, 9 stolen bases and 24 walks.

Rentería has two brothers, Edinson and Evert, who played minor league baseball. In 1998, Edgar and his brother Edinson created Team Rentería to help Colombian baseball by giving professional instruction to Colombian professional baseball players and holding youth clinics for amateurs. In 1999, Team Rentería founded the Colombian Professional Baseball League. The league is still in existence today, although the 2010–11 season was cancelled due to harsh weather. In 1997, Colombian president Ernesto Samper presented Rentería with Colombia&#x27;s highest honor, the &quot;San Carlos Cross of the Order of the Great Knight&quot;.

In 2010, it was announced that the baseball stadium replacing the former Estadio Tomás Arrieta in his hometown of Barranquilla would be renamed in Rentería&#x27;s honor. The Estadio Édgar Rentería opened in 2018, and currently houses the Caimanes de Barranquilla of the Colombian Professional Baseball League.

<text>Valery Abisalovich Gergiev (, ; ; born 2 May 1953) is a Russian conductor and opera company director. He is currently general director and artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre and of the Bolshoi Theatre and artistic director of the White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg. He was formerly chief conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and of the Munich Philharmonic.

==Early life==
Gergiev was born in Moscow. He is the son of Tamara Timofeevna (Tatarkanovna) Lagkueva and Abisal Zaurbekovich Gergiev, both of Ossetian origin. He and his siblings were raised in Vladikavkaz in North Ossetia in the Caucasus. He had his first piano lessons in secondary school before going on to study at the Leningrad Conservatory from 1972 to 1977.

His principal conducting teacher was Ilya Musin. His sister, Larissa, is a pianist and director of the Mariinsky&#x27;s singers&#x27; academy.

==Career==

In 1978, Gergiev became assistant conductor at the Kirov Opera, now the Mariinsky Opera, under Yuri Temirkanov, where he made his debut conducting Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. He was chief conductor of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra from 1981 until 1985. He became chief conductor and artistic director of the Mariinsky in 1988, and overall director of the company, appointed by the Russian government, in 1996.

After the 2004 Beslan school massacre, Gergiev appealed on television for calm and against revenge. He conducted concerts to commemorate the victims of the massacre.
During the 2008 South Ossetia war, Gergiev, who is of partial Ossetian heritage himself, accused the Georgian government of massacring ethnic Ossetians, triggering the conflict with Russia. He came to Tskhinvali and conducted a concert near the ruined building of the South Ossetian Parliament as tribute to the victims of the war.

In June 2011, Gergiev joined the International Tchaikovsky Competition and introduced reforms to the organisation. On 5 May 2016, Gergiev performed at the Roman Theatre of Palmyra at a concert event called &quot;Praying for Palmyra – Music revives ancient ruins&quot;, devoted to casualties of the March 2016 Palmyra offensive.

In December 2023, Gergiev was appointed artistic director of the Bolshoi Theatre, with immediate effect, with an initial contract of 5 years. Gergiev is the first person to hold the directorships of the Mariinsky Theatre and the Bolshoi Theatre simultaneously.

===Career outside of Russia===
In 1985, Gergiev made his debut in the United Kingdom, along with pianist Evgeny Kissin and violinists Maxim Vengerov and Vadim Repin at the Lichfield Festival. In 1988, Gergiev guest-conducted the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) for the first time. In 1991, Gergiev conducted a western European opera company for the first time, leading the Bavarian State Opera in a performance of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in Munich. In the same year, he made his American début, performing &quot;War and Peace&quot; with the San Francisco Opera. From 1995 until 2008 Gergiev was principal conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. Gergiev returned to the LSO in 2004, in concerts with the seven symphonies of Sergei Prokofiev. This engagement led to his appointment in 2005 as the Orchestra&#x27;s fifteenth principal conductor, as of 1 January 2007, with an initial contract of 3 years. In April 2007, Gergiev was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the ten-year classical music outreach manifesto, &quot;Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st century&quot;, to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. Gergiev stood down as LSO principal conductor in 2015.

In 2015, Gergiev became chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, In March 2022, Gergiev was dismissed from Munich Philharmonic after he refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Political involvement==
Gergiev has been, according to Alex Ross in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;a prominent supporter of the current Russian regime&quot; of Vladimir Putin. In 2012, in a television ad for Putin&#x27;s third Presidential campaign, he said: &quot;One needs to be able to hold oneself presidentially, so that people reckon with the country. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fear? Respect? Reckoning.&quot;

In December 2012, Gergiev sided with the Putin administration against the members of Russian band Pussy Riot and suggested that their motivation was commercial.

In New York City in 2013, the LGBT activist group Queer Nation interrupted performances by orchestras conducted by Gergiev at the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall. The activists cited Gergiev&#x27;s support for Vladimir Putin, whose government had recently enacted a law that bans the distribution of &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&quot; to minors, as the reason for their actions. In London, the veteran activist Peter Tatchell led anti-Gergiev demonstrations. In a public statement Gergiev replied: &quot;It is wrong to suggest that I have ever supported anti-gay legislation and in all my work I have upheld equal rights for all people. I am an artist and have for over three decades worked with tens of thousands of people and many of them are indeed my friends.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mark Brown wrote: &quot;Gergiev&#x27;s case was not helped by comments he made to the Dutch newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; on 10 September [2013]: &#x27;In Russia we do everything we can to protect children from paedophiles. This law is not about homosexuality, it targets paedophilia. But I have too busy a schedule to explore this matter in detail. On 26 December 2013, the city of Munich made public a letter from Gergiev assuring them that he fully supports the city&#x27;s anti-discrimination law and adding: &quot;In my entire professional career as an artist, I have always and everywhere adhered to these principles and will do so in the future... All other allegations hurt me very much.&quot;

In March 2014 he joined a host of other Russian arts and cultural figures in signing an open letter in support of the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The letter was posted on the website of Russia&#x27;s culture ministry on 12 March 2014. In the letter signatories stated that they &quot;firmly declare our support for the position of the president of the Russian Federation&quot; in the region. However, in September 2015, as he became chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, Gergiev said that he did not really sign the letter to Putin, but only had a phone conversation about it with Vladimir Medinsky. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Russian artists may have been pushed by the Russian government to endorse the annexation of Crimea. The article specifically mentioned Gergiev, who faced protests in New York City while performing. After a public outcry in the country, the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture blacklisted Gergiev from performing in Ukraine.

===Terminations after 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra said that it would drop Gergiev from its September festival if he did not stop supporting Putin. Milan&#x27;s La Scala also sent a letter to Gergiev asking him to declare his support for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine or he would not be permitted to complete his engagement conducting Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. This followed an announcement by New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall that it had canceled two May performances by the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra that were to be conducted by Gergiev, and the Vienna Philharmonic dropping Gergiev from a five-concert tour in the U.S. that was to start on 25 February.

On 28 February, the Verbier Festival requested and accepted Gergiev&#x27;s resignation as Music Director of the Verbier Festival Orchestra. On 1 March, Munich&#x27;s mayor Dieter Reiter announced the termination of Gergiev&#x27;s contract as conductor of the Munich Philharmonic for failing to respond to a demand that he condemn the &quot;brutal war of aggression that Putin is waging against Ukraine and now, in particular, against our sister city of Kyiv&quot;. On 13 October, Gergiev was expelled from his position as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music for his reluctance to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

==Personal life==
In 1999, Gergiev married musician Natalya Dzebisova, herself of Ossetian descent and 27 years his junior. They have three children together: two boys and a girl. From time to time, Gergiev has been reported to be a friend of Putin; they have been said to be godfathers to each other&#x27;s children, but in a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Gergiev rejected this notion. From a past relationship with the language teacher Lena Ostovich, he has another daughter, Natasha.

In April 2022, the Anti-Corruption Foundation of Russian Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny released a video revealing the immense wealth of Gergiev, including various properties in Italy (among others Palazzo Barbarigo in Venice), the U.S. and Russia. A significant part of his wealth is said to stem from the inheritance of Yoko Nagae Ceschina.

==Recordings==
Gergiev has focused on recording Russian composers&#x27; works, both operatic and symphonic, including Mikhail Glinka, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Alexander Borodin, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Igor Stravinsky and Rodion Shchedrin. Most of his recordings, on the Philips label, are with the Kirov Orchestra, but he has also recorded with the Vienna Philharmonic. Recent undertaking such as the complete Prokofiev symphonies (from the live concerts of 2004) and a Berlioz cycle, are with the London Symphony Orchestra.

Gergiev&#x27;s recording of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with London Symphony Orchestra on LSO Live in 2010 was voted the winner of the Orchestral category and the Disc of the Year for the 2011 BBC Music Magazine Awards.

<text>Soyuz T-2 (, &quot;Union T-2&quot;) was a 1980 Soviet crewed space flight to the Salyut 6 space station. It was the 12th mission to and 10th successful docking at the orbiting facility. The Soyuz T-2 crew were the second to visit the long-duration Soyuz 35 resident crew.

Soyuz T-2 carried Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov into space. A mission lasting under four days, its primary purpose was to perform a crewed test of the new Soyuz-T spacecraft.

==Crew==
===Backup crew===
==Mission highlights==

When the visiting Soyuz 36 Intercosmos crew departed Salyut 6 on 3 June 1980 and the remaining resident crew almost immediately redocked the Soyuz craft left behind, observers speculated the secretive Soviets were possibly planning a second Intercosmos mission. The failure of Soyuz 33 the year before had forced the Soviets to juggle their launch schedule.

A launch indeed was soon in the offing, but not the predicted mission. Soyuz T-2 was launched 5 June with Yury Malyshev and Vladimir Aksyonov on what turned out to be the first crewed mission of the new Soyuz T variant. The craft had new engine systems and could launch three cosmonauts. Additionally, the Soyuz was equipped with a new Argon computer which controlled docking and reentry procedures.

As the craft approached Salyut 6, solar cells, re-introduced to the Soyuz, were tested. The approach was completed automatically, while the final 180 metres were achieved manually on 6 June. The Argon docking computer had failed, leaving the craft perpendicular to the station. The computer failure was later explained as being caused by the crew and controllers failing to have practiced the particular approach the computer chose. The crew had therefore chosen to dock manually to be safe; the computer would have successfully docked if allowed to, said the Soviets. However, failures during the automatic approach was a recurring problem in future Soyuz T missions.

During their short stay, Malyshev and Aksyonov seemed to have carried out a minimum of experiments, including participating in some medical tests and using the Salyut&#x27;s MKF-6M camera. They undocked in the craft they arrived on only two days after first greeting the resident crew. As they left, the Salyut turned around and the Soyuz T-2 crew photographed and visually inspected the space station. The Soyuz then departed and landed about three hours later.

<doc id="849638" wikidata="Q3820721" url="?curid=849638" title="Rodízio">
<text>Rodízio (, ) is an all-you-can-eat style of restaurant service in Brazilian restaurants where waiters bring a variety of foods repeatedly throughout the meal, until the customer signals that they have had enough. Traditionally, refers to a fare of grilled meats, but there are many other options – pizza, pasta, hamburgers and Asian cuisine are among some other offers by existing and popular -style restaurants.

==Description==

In most areas of the world outside of Brazil, a &quot;rodízio&quot; restaurant refers to a Brazilian-style steakhouse restaurant, where customers pay a fixed price (&quot;preço fixo&quot;). 

In &quot;churrascarias&quot; or the traditional Brazilian-style steakhouse restaurants, servers come to the table with knives and a vertically-held skewer, on which are speared various kinds of premium cuts of meat, most commonly local cuts of beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and sometimes atypical or exotic meats. The exact origin of the &quot;rodízio&quot; style of service is unknown, but the traditional story is that this serving style was created when a waiter delivered a meat skewer to the wrong table by mistake but let the guest take a small piece of the meat anyway. 

&quot;Rodízio&quot; became increasingly popular in Brazil in the mid-20th century and spread around the world as experienced servers moved to open their own restaurants. In Brazil, the &quot;rodízio&quot; style is sometimes also found in Italian (Italian restaurants serving pizza are especially common) or more recently Japanese restaurants. Rodízio of crepes are also common in Brazil, as also rodízios of other types of foods.

In a &quot;churrascaria&quot;, the &quot;rodízio&quot; courses are served right off the cooking spit and are sliced or plated right at the table. Thin slices are carved from the roasted outside layer of large cuts; the diners may use a pair of small stainless-steel tongs to grab the slices as they are cut, and then place them on their plate. Alternatively, the server will push smaller kebab-style chunks off the end of the skewer onto a serving plate.

Often, the meat servings are accompanied with fried potatoes, fried polenta, fried bananas, collard greens, black beans, rice, salads, or other side dishes (usually self-served buffet style).

In many restaurants, the diner is provided with a colored card or token. One colored side indicates to servers to bring more meat. The other side, with a different color, indicates that the diners have enough for the moment. This does not necessarily signal that the diner is finished eating, but only indicates that no more meat servings are desired at that moment.

== History ==
According to ACHUESP – the Association of Steakhouses in the State of São Paulo – the most widely accepted version of the origin of the &quot;rodízio&quot; dates back to the mid-1960s at Churrascaria 477 in Jacupiranga, SP, which was run by Albino Ongaratto.

As the story goes, on a day when the steakhouse was packed with pilgrims coming from the Bom Jesus de Iguape festival, a flustered waiter mixed up orders across several tables, creating quite a commotion. In response, Albino decided it would be best to serve all the skewers to all the tables. The idea was well received and quickly became a routine at the restaurant, delighting customers and eventually gaining worldwide recognition.

Churrascaria 477 still operates in the same location.

==Fare==
The following foods are often seen at a &quot;churrascaria&quot; served &quot;rodízio&quot; style:

* Filet mignon chunks wrapped in bacon
* Turkey chunks wrapped in bacon (these two are usually two-bite sized)
* Sirloin steak (cut semicircular and served in slices)
* Roast beef (served like sirloin steak)
* Rump cover (called &quot;picanha&quot; in Portuguese)
* Flap steak (called &quot;fraldinha&quot; in Portuguese)
* Beef short ribs
* Lamb
* Pork ribs
* &quot;Chouriço&quot; or some other spicy Iberian pork sausage
* Chicken hearts
* Grilled dark-meat chicken
* Grilled pineapple or banana (meant as a palate cleanser between courses)

<text>The PC Weenies is a webcomic with a special focus on technology humor and geek culture, as experienced through the lives of the fictitious Weiner family. &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; was created and launched on the web in October 1998 by Krishna M. Sadasivam, a former electrical engineer. The series has enjoyed success in web and print media. Most notably, &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; was the first webcomic to appear regularly on CNET. &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; currently appear in print within Tau Beta Pi&#x27;s The BENT publication. The comic has also appeared within print in EE Times, the largest electronic engineering publication in the world. The PC Weenies webcomic also appears regularly on BBspot.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The PC Weenies&quot; follows the life of the Weiner family, a household of technology geeks. The main character is the 40-year old Bob Weiner who loses his job in the tech industry and searches for a new one, all the while dealing with his family and the rapidly advancing computer industry.

==Development==
In 1998, Sadasivam first considered the idea of creating a webcomic about a family of computer geeks while taking a shower; less than a week later, he uploaded the first page of &quot;The PC Weenies&quot;. Sadasivam initially worked with a multi-panel layout for his webcomic, but switched over to single-panel cartoons after a few weeks and stuck with this format for eight years. According to Sadasivam, creating &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; involves doing research, as he reads technology news websites and blogs in order to comment on the latest developments.

Sadasivam released a print collection of his webcomic under the title &quot;PC Weenies: Rebootus Maximus&quot; in 2009. Sadasivam announced the end of &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; in May 2011. Among the reasons for the webcomic&#x27;s conclusion, Sadasivam cited that he desired to focus on illustration, that his audience had been plateauing, and that he had to deal with several large emergency bills at the time. On his website, he wrote that &quot;the time I spend on making the comic could be better spent on other income-generating areas, and right now I have to do what’s best for my family.&quot; The webcomic has since resumed.

<text>Richard A. Cohen (born 1952) is a Christian psychotherapist and author associated with the ex-gay movement. He is a co-founder of Positive Approaches to Healthy Sexuality (previously Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality) which offers discredited conversion therapy practices purporting to change a person from homosexual to heterosexual. In 2002, Cohen was expelled from the American Counseling Association for multiple violations. 

He is author of &quot;Alfie&#x27;s Home&quot;, a children&#x27;s book which depicts homosexuality as a reversible condition. He gained media attention after demonstrating his ex-gay touch therapy on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, which included cuddling with men and beating a pillow.

==Biography==
Cohen was born into a Jewish family in Philadelphia. During adolescence, Cohen reportedly spent &quot;years in intensive psychiatric treatment unsuccessfully trying to become straight&quot;.

Cohen identified as gay during his undergraduate years at Boston University. He sought counseling for his unwanted same-sex attractions. He became an evangelical Christian, and later joined the Unification Church.

In 1980, Cohen married Jae Sook, a South Korean woman, and in 1995, Cohen and his family left the Unification Church. Cohen had affairs with men, often leaving his wife and children for long periods of time.

According to The Washington Post, Cohen he &quot;overcame homosexuality&quot; in 1987 through an &quot;intense but platonic relationship&quot; with a straight man who &quot;gave me the warmth of my daddy&#x27;s love.&quot; 

Cohen received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Boston University and a Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology from Antioch University.

He is author of &quot;Alfie&#x27;s Home&quot;, a children&#x27;s book which depicts homosexuality as a reversible condition. He served as the president of Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX), a group which promoted reparative therapy.

===Expulsion from the ACA===
In 2002, Cohen was expelled from the American Counseling Association (ACA) for violating its policies on advertising, engaging in dual relationships involving clients and counselors, and compromising client welfare. He did not appeal the ACA decision.

===Media appearances===
Cohen was interviewed by Jason Jones on the March 19, 2007, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. He gained media attention for demonstrating cuddling with men and hitting pillows as a method for curing homosexuality. After the appearance, PFOX scrubbed mention of Cohen&#x27;s name from its website.

Cohen was on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on June 28, 2006, was interviewed on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; on December 8, 2009, and was on &quot;The Michelangelo Signorile Show&quot; on the Sirius radio network on April 17, 2010.

<text>Brewers Retail Inc., doing business as The Beer Store, is a privately owned chain of retail outlets selling beer and other malt beverages in the province of Ontario, Canada.

Founded in 1927 as Brewers Retail, it was owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers. It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by three brewing companies: Molson, Labatt, and Sleeman, which are owned by multinational corporations. It is also partially owned (under 0.02%) by 30 Ontario-based brewers. Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices, subject to Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.

Under Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Liquor Control Act&quot;, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned LCBO, and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities. The act and the company&#x27;s articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell &quot;hard liquor&quot; (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries). Brewers Retail adopted the current name in 1985.

Amendments made to the &quot;Liquor Control Act&quot; have since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at select supermarkets in Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of &quot;beer commons.&quot; A 2013 Angus Reid survey commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Stores Association found that only 13% of Ontario residents were aware that &quot;The Beer Store monopoly is not a government-owned enterprise.&quot; The Beer Store operates approximately 450 outlets in Ontario and made a gross profit of about $396-million in 2016.
In early June 2019, the provincial government passed legislation to terminate its 10-year contract with the company, six years prior to expiry; continued negotiations with TBS were underway prior to actual enactment of the legislation. This step was a prelude to making beer widely available in variety stores in Ontario.

In May 2024, the Ontario government announced an agreement with Brewers Retail allowing beer, wine, cider, and ready-to-mix alcoholic beverages to be sold, before the scheduled end of the master contract, in 8,000 corner stores, grocery stores, gas stations and eventually big box chains in exchange for $225 million in compensation being paid to The Beer Store. Sales in grocery and corner stores began in September 2024. As a result, The Beer Store&#x27; s market share is expected to fall from 41% in 2024 to 15% by 2026-27.

==Company==
The Beer Store follows an open ownership model whereby any qualifying brewer is allowed the opportunity to become a Beer Store shareholder, but three multi-nationals own the vast majority of shares: Molson-Coors, Labatt (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) and Sleeman (owned by Japan&#x27;s Sapporo). Some smaller brewers also own shares, making the company a consortium of 30 Ontario based brewers. In order to qualify, the brewer must operate at least one facility in Ontario, conduct the full brewing process and sell beer through the corporation. Valid Ontario and Canadian manufacturing licences are required and the brewer must not produce beer in any other jurisdiction, or else meet minimum annual capacity and production goals.

The Beer Store is governed by the Liquor Control Act (LCA) and is therefore regulated by the LCBO. 

As of December 2016, the company operated over 450 retail stores which sell beer to the general public. TThe Beer Store (TBS) is the largest distributor of domestic beer in Ontario, selling to over 20,723 licensed customers. Although many imported beers are available at the Beer Store, the LCBO serves as the primary importer. Once imported, the product is then sold to the Beer Store for further distribution. As the primary retailer of Ontario, The Beer Store sells more than 720 brands of beer and over 1,000 home consumer beer selling units from 180 different brewers around the world. Larger Beer Store outlets typically stock around 600 beer selling units with the smallest Beer Stores stocking around 200 units.

TBS has a policy of accepting any brewer in the world to sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO. Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in. Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies. Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectolitres a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectolitres of beer produced that year. Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectolitres a year are now provided with 2 free guaranteed product listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores.

TBS employees have long been unionized and represented by United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 12R24.

==History==
The company began in 1927, with the end of prohibition in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be unsuccessful, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other Canadian provinces), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail, which was then using The Beer Store brand as early as 1985 by the Bill Davis government.

==The Beer Store today==
===Operating Model &amp; Pricing Market===
The Beer Store claims that it operates on a self-sustaining basis as an efficient distributor and retailer of beer in the Province of Ontario. Operations take place on a fee for service basis, requiring brewers to pay a fee to sell their products through the Beer Store. The Beer Store publishes an annual rate sheet outlining their necessary financial requirements and consistency with annual budget and business plans.

The open nature of the Beer Store combined with pricing freedom for individual brewers is claimed to have created a highly competitive beer pricing market. The Beer Store processes hundreds of price changes every month and the average retail selling price in the system has only increased 2.8% from 2003 to 2014 while the general rate of Ontario inflation over the same period was approximately 20%. Ontario&#x27;s uniform pricing regulation precludes price competition between beer retailers such as the LCBO and the Beer Store. Price competition between individual brewers and brands within the Beer Store system is claimed to be significant, but there is little real competition as there is little variance in price both over time and between brands of similar quality. The system does benefit remote areas in that lower-priced products are not restricted to larger outlets in urban centers, but are available at all Beer Store locations throughout the province. Hence rural consumers benefit as much (or as little) as urban consumers.

===Estimated profits===
The Beer Store states it operates as a not-for-profit entity. While this may be true, critics have argued that the TBS system is structured to support relatively high prices and profits of the breweries to the detriment of consumers. A series of studies, authored or co-authored by professor Anindya Sen of the University of Waterloo, estimated that the near-monopoly the Beer Store has in Ontario allows its owners to capture between $450 and $630 million in “additional profits” each year.

The first of the Sen studies was commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Store Association and surveyed six 24-pack domestic brands from IGA and Metro Quebec flyers compared to the same brands at The Beer Store in Ontario over a 22-week period in 2013. Sen corrected tax analysis associated with the original study and added three import brands from a Costco in Quebec in subsequent analysis. Correcting for tax differentials between the two provinces, positive price differences of $1.3 - $3.3 were found to exist between their average price of 24-bottle packs of brands including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Coors Light, Budweiser and Bud Light. Using Molson Canadian as an example, the adjusted 24 pack price from Quebec IGA and Metro flyers was found to be $26.81 versus $28.12 for Ontario TBS locations.

In response to Sen&#x27;s analysis, The Beer Store commissioned a survey of Quebec – Ontario beer pricing by Debra Aron, an economist with Navigant Economics, which reviewed average TBS home consumer beer prices for all of 2013 in comparison to all beer sales at Quebecs seven largest grocery chains, utilizing Neilsen data, for the same period. Aron&#x27;s study concluded that the average TBS beer prices, excluding all taxes, were 18% less than those at Quebec grocery stores in 2013 or on a per case basis approximately $4.40 less per case of 24 cans.

Reports from 2015 indicated that 80% of beer sales in Ontario were made at the 450 outlets of The Beer Store. An estimate published in 2017, provided this summary as to profitability, &quot;Add the cost savings together with the extra market share and you get $396-million. That is how valuable The Beer Store is to its owners.&quot;

===Green policies===
Since 1927, the Beer Store has refunded deposits on all empty beer containers purchased in Ontario. In February 2007 the Ontario Deposit Return Program (ODRP) was launched by the Government of Ontario. The ODRP&#x27;s goal is to ensure that 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled. All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario&#x27;s waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher-end recycling supporting Ontario&#x27;s green economy and generating environmental benefits. “This success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,” said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement. As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality glass cullet for Ontario glass manufacturing – previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source glass cullet from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013–2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads. Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil).

Between 2013 and 2014, the Beer Store achieved a system-wide recovery and re-use rate of 99 per cent for the industry standard bottles, which are reused 12 to 15 times. The Beer Store has received praise from local and national organizations including the Conservation Council of Ontario, Environmental Defence Canada, The Recycling Council of Ontario, and Toronto Environmental Alliance.

TBS’ recycling efforts translate into cost savings for municipal governments as municipalities need not spend tax revenue on recycling packaging that TBS sells. In 2008, TBS estimated that its return program has saved taxpayers $38 million in avoided waste management and recycling program costs per year. In 2012, the TBS estimated that savings had increased to $40 million with 94% of beer containers and 81% of LCBO containers recycled.

The Beer Store also is actively engaged in reducing its carbon footprint by finding innovative ways to reduce its energy consumption, a key input for any retail organization, especially one with a need to constantly refrigerate its product. A notable initiative is the use of outside air to cool beer when outside temperatures provide for such a tactic.

Pierre Sadik, Senior Policy Adviser at the David Suzuki Foundation has stated, &quot;Ontarians should be proud of The Beer Store&#x27;s environmental achievements. It&#x27;s time businesses across the province follow The Beer Store&#x27;s lead and turn their talk about waste diversion into real action.&quot;

===Corporate responsibility===

TBS maintains a strict policy of “ID 30” and the right to refuse any customer who appears intoxicated or who is underage. Furthermore, TBS empowers its retail management to actively monitor and track every employee&#x27;s refusal rate to ensure proper conformance to company policy. In 2017, TBS employee challenge and refusal rates are the following:

RETAIL BEER CHALLENGES AND REFUSALS CY17 | Jan 2017 – Dec 2017

# Minors Challenged/asked to produce I.D: 3,388,975 
# Minors Refused service: 31,983
# Intoxicants Challenged/suspected for being impaired (alcohol/drugs): 13,583
# Intoxicants Refused service for impairment: 10,390

The Beer Store works closely with Police agencies across Ontario to report suspected impaired driving. Also Retail employees will work with the customer in finding other means of transportation(cab/transit/call a friend) home if suspected they are impaired and refused service, they go the extra step to make sure the customer will arrive alive and not just let them find a way home.

===Returns for Leukemia===
Since 2006 The Beer Store, UFCW Local 12R24 (the union representing its employees), and the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada have partnered together to help raise awareness and funds for blood cancer research through the collection of empty bottles.
The bottle drive is formally called &quot;Returns for Leukemia&quot; but many refer to it as the &quot;Leukemia Bottle Drive&quot;. It is held on the last Saturday of May and is also the world&#x27;s largest bottle drive. Over the last 13 years, through donations of cash and empties, the event has raised over $15 million for the cause.

==Cancellation of contract==
The Ontario government&#x27;s plan to cancel the contract with The Beer Store as the sole seller of beer in packages exceeding six units, began with legislation tabled in late May 2019. (The ten year &quot;Master Framework Agreement&quot; was signed in 2015 by the government in power at the time.) The plan has led to some concern, with certain industry sources suggesting that the company will be entitled to significant damages, up to one billion dollars according to some estimates; if so, that would be costly for the taxpayer. The government believes that the cancellation is important but has not addressed the concerns raised by the industry. Finance Minister Vic Fedeli told the news media that the current monopoly on beer sales in bulk &quot;is a bad deal for consumers and businesses and is deeply unfair to the people of Ontario&quot;.

TBS president Ted Moroz issued this statement: &quot;The government cannot extinguish our right to damages as outlined in the Master Framework Agreement. It is critical to understand that The Beer Store has, in good faith, based on a legally-negotiated 10-year operating agreement with the Province of Ontario, invested more than $100 million to modernize its stores and to continue to upgrade the consumer experience. [We] will fight this legislation vigorously through the courts...&quot;. John Nock of the United Food and Commercial Workers union made this statement, &quot;We will fight this government and this premier to keep our jobs and to save the taxpayers the billions Ford is willing to pay to put beer in corner stores&quot;.

Ontario Chamber of Commerce President Rocco Rossi wrote to Fedeli stating that the plan to cancel the contract with TBS was a &quot;short-sighted approach&quot; that could lead to other corporations refusing to contract with the Province. Fedeli dismissed suggestions that the government might be required to pay up to $1 billion as a result of cancelling the contract at this time.

The previous government had approved the sale of beer in six packs or less in a limited number of supermarkets in 2018 but the plan to cancel the contract with TBS would provide greater &quot;choice and convenience&quot; according to Fedeli. The government passed legislation to cancel the contract in early June but did not immediately proclaim it into law, because negotiations were continuing with TBS about the cancellation process. TBS Board chair Charlie Angelakos believed that negotiations could lead to a &quot;mutually acceptable&quot; method of increasing the availability of beer in retail locations and could prevent a &quot;protracted legal battle and the significant damages to which the government would be exposed&quot;.

In May 2024, the Ford government announced an agreement to terminate its contract with the Beer Store a year early at a cost of at least $225 million in payments to the Beer Store as part of a plan to expand beer sales, and sales of some alcohol products, in grocery stores, corner stores, gas stations, and big box retailers. The Opposition Liberals claimed the plan would cost taxpayers in excess of $1 billion in fees, incentive payments to grocery stores, and lost tax revenue.

Initially, expanded beer and alcohol sales were to start in January 2026, but in August 2024 it was announced that corner stores would begin being able to sell alcohol in September 2024. According to the government&#x27;s Fall Economic Statement released at the end of October 2024, the Beer Store&#x27;s share of provincial alcohol sales is projected to fall from a 41% market share in 2024 to a 15% share by 2026-27. At its peak, the Beer Store/Brewers&#x27; Retail had been responsible for 90% of Ontario&#x27;s beer market.

===Closures===
Following the cancellation of the Master Framework Agreement, 23 Beer Store locations closed between May 2024 and the end of February 2025, with more closures expected as TBS&#x27; market share drops. Up to 100 stores are expected to close by the end of 2025 with more closures expected in 2026 as the number of convenience stores lisenced to sell beer expands.

==Criticism==
===Brewer neutrality===
The Beer Store employees are not allowed to recommend one brand over another. Staff can tell customers about the products but cannot encourage customers to choose a specific brand. This policy is known as brewer neutrality.
The Beer Store is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries listing fees, for each beer carried in stock, that many critics perceive as substantial.

===Consumer prices===
Critics say TBS constitutes a foreign-owned monopoly over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer more in the long run in terms of convenience and price. Critics also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the price of beer will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled “Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario” by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta&#x27;s deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol price rises have since tripled Ontario&#x27;s (28.2% vs 9.2%). By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost of beer between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model.

===Political controversy===
The Beer Store has been subject to criticism following the Molson-Coors merger, whose 49% stake in TBS was the last 100% Canadian-owned share of the venture under the pre-merger Molson Breweries. In 2005, Ontario&#x27;s alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. A report called the Beverage Alcohol System Review was released on March 24, 2005, by the Ontario Government. However, the report&#x27;s findings dealt centrally with the LCBO and the economic and social impact of its privatization.

An online petition was started by a private citizen, Derek Forward, to ask the provincial government to end the monopoly enjoyed by the Beer Store. The petition has received coverage in the Toronto Star, and has generated enough support to allow it to be formally presented to the provincial legislature in the fall of 2008 for consideration (petition No. P–146: &quot;Practice and arrangement of retailing beer&quot;). However, on December 9, 2008, the Ontario government dismissed the petition citing the effectiveness of the TBS system.

At the start of the 2007 provincial election campaign, The Brick Brewing Company of Waterloo (later renamed Waterloo Brewing Company and purchased by Carlsberg Group) made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company&#x27;s statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests. Additionally, Brick claimed that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force the brewer to stop offering beer in &quot;stubbies&quot; by withholding supplies of industry standard &quot;long-necked&quot; bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry-standard bottle and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed. Brick has since stopped selling beer in &quot;stubbies&quot; because the cost was too high.

A July 2008 Toronto Star article attributed an industry analyst as estimating the three foreign entities that owned TBS earned $1 billion in profit per year in Canada.

Ontario Craft Brewers is the main lobby group for Ontario&#x27;s smaller brewers, and has been increasingly critical of BRI/TBS. The 29 OCB members currently employ several thousand Ontarians. OCB wants to either acquire shares in TBS or be permitted to set up their own competing chain. Premier McGuinty responded by saying that his government would not consider any application to form a competing chain, and that his government would not consider compelling TBS shareholders to sell any shares, although some Liberal and Conservative backbenchers have said they would expect BRI to at least negotiate in good faith with craft brewers who made a serious offer. BRI responded by saying that it was not considering and would not consider selling shares at any price, and that they do more than enough to accommodate non-shareholding brewers already. Canada&#x27;s National Brewers (the lobby group that represents the BRI shareholders) further said that in the event OCB did get to set up a competing chain, they would refuse to stock their products there.

In February 2012, the website &quot;Canadian Beer News&quot; reported that The Beer Store has made thousands of dollars worth of political donations to the British Columbia Liberal Party and British Columbia New Democratic Party. The report noted that it was odd for an Ontario-based company to be making such large donations to political parties in another province, and suggested that the co-owning breweries were funnelling this money through The Beer Store in an attempt to put pressure on the BC government to give their brands favourable placements in BC Liquor stores.

In 2015, it signed a contract &quot;Master Framework Agreement&quot; with the Government of Ontario which required the company to &quot;improve the customer experience&quot; in its retail outlets. The contract expires in 2025, limits the number of retail outlets permitted to sell beer, and specifies the company will receive a monetary award
for breach of contract even if the breach results from a change in government legislation.

===Non-competitive business practices===

On December 9, 2014, Toronto Star investigative journalist Martin Regg Cohn exposed an agreement between The Beer Store and the LCBO to limit competition, by ensuring that the LCBO would not offer beer products in 12 or 24-pack cases, it would not sell major brands to restaurants or bars, and would inform the Beer Store of any store it was planning to open in a new community. The document, dated, June 1, 2000, and provided to him by a whistleblower, was signed by then head of the LCBO Andy Brandt and head of BRI Daver Perkins, of which a copy was sent to Ministry of Consumer &amp; Commercial Relations Deputy Minister Sandra Lang.

In a 2014 report to the government on maximizing assets, former TD Bank CEO Ed Clark stated that the LCBO (and the Government of Ontario) forgoes $515 million of revenue by not allowing sales of larger format beer packages and forgoes $500 million of revenue by not selling major brands to restaurants. Andy Brandt, former highly successful head of the LCBO, was very critical of the agreement, and says it was forced upon him by the then Mike Harris Progressive Conservative government. When Regg Cohn questioned the Beer Store representatives about the agreement, suggesting it is collusion, the reply from the BRI lawyer Michael A. Eizenga of Bennett Jones LLP stated the &quot;use of the term &#x27;collusion&#x27; which has significant legal meaning,&quot; and &quot;This is an inaccurate and inappropriate characterization, to which my client objects.&quot;

Liberal Finance Minister Charles Sousa, in response to these revelations, says he has &quot;got the investigation underway&quot; and that &quot;I&#x27;m trying to ensure that what you’re suggesting doesn’t happen any further ... You&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s a monopoly, a duopoly, oligopoly — call it what you will.&quot;

On December 10, 2014, Restaurants Canada filed an official complaint with the Competition Bureau. &quot;&#x27;We did not know the depth of the complicity,&#x27; it said, pointing to &#x27;new and disturbing information&#x27; in the Star that detailed price gouging of restaurants and bars forced to buy from The Beer Store ... A Competition Bureau spokesperson said it is &#x27;reviewing it to determine whether the conduct in question could raise concerns under the criminal or civil provisions in the Competition Act.&#x27;&quot;

On April 15, 2015, Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne announced the Master Framework Agreement—a 10-year agreement with The Beer Store allowing changes to provincial liquor laws that would, among other changes, allow up to 450 supermarkets in &quot;urban population centres&quot; (roughly equating the number of Beer Store locations) to be authorized to sell beer subject to conditions, require The Beer Store to improve the placement and marketing of Ontario craft brews, and allow LCBO locations to trial carrying 12-packs. Wynne stated that The Beer Store had become a &quot;de-facto monopoly controlled by a small number of companies&quot;. The new regulations took effect on December 15, 2015, with 58 designated supermarkets, and additional locations to be added in the future; all products must be below 7.1% alcohol by volume, and at least 20% of a store&#x27;s stock must be Ontario craft brews. Loblaw Companies elected to go beyond the minimum quota and committed to stock 50% Ontario craft brews at its participating stores, in an effort to provide a wider array of options.

Current premier Doug Ford is a supporter of private liquor sales. On May 27, 2019, Minister of Finance Vic Fedeli tabled legislation proposing the unwinding of the Master Framework Agreement. Fedeli described the MFA as a &quot;sweetheart deal by the previous government&quot; for &quot;three global giants&quot; who were &quot;more interested in protecting profits than providing convenience or choice for average people.&quot;

==In popular culture==

In the film &quot;Strange Brew&quot; the McKenzie Brothers visit a Brewers Retail store demanding a refund after they attempt to return a bottle of beer that contained a mouse (the mouse was however placed in the bottle by the brothers). Due to the nature of the scene, Brewers Retail refused to allow the use of one of their actual stores for the filming, and also refused to allow the use of the name &quot;Brewers Retail&quot;. In response, the filmmakers built their own replica store, and called it &quot;The Beer Store&quot;. Coincidentally, several years later, Brewers Retail changed the name of its stores to &quot;The Beer Store&quot;, and they continue to operate under this name.

The Beer Store was also showcased in episodes of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s week-long tenure in Toronto during the week of February 10, 2004.

==Related companies==

Brewers&#x27; Distributor Ltd. (BDL) operates in Western Canada and is owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev and Molson-Coors (Sleeman has its own distribution operation in the West). Unlike BRI, BDL only warehouses and distributes beer and is not in the retail business.

<doc id="849647" wikidata="Q7798023" url="?curid=849647" title="Three wishes">
<text>Three wishes is a literary motif, often encountered in the joke format, in which a character is given three wishes by a supernatural being, and dramatically, horrifically, or comedically fails to make the best use of them. Common scenarios include releasing a genie from a lamp, catching and agreeing to release a mermaid or magical fish, or crossing paths with the devil. In some uses, the first two wishes go as expected, with the third wish being misinterpreted, or granted in an unexpected fashion that doesn&#x27;t reflect the intent of the wish. In others, the first wish causes things to go awry, and the second wish only makes things worse, with the third wish being used to return things to the way they were before the first two wishes. Alternatively, the wishes are split between three people, with the last person&#x27;s wish inadvertently or intentionally thwarting or undoing the wishes of the other characters.

The three wishes motif has an Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index tale number of 750A.

The motif has been described as &quot;common in oral tradition for centuries (particularly in Arabian fantasy), with wishes granted by genies freed from a bottle)&quot;. 
==Examples and variations==
An early example of this is found in Charles Perrault&#x27;s 1697 story &quot;The Ridiculous Wishes&quot;:

In some versions of this tale, black pudding is used instead of sausages, and in some versions, it is the woodcutter himself that gets the sausage stuck on his nose. It has also been asserted that the motif was &quot;first written down as &#x27;The Three Wishes&#x27; (1757 &quot;Le Magasin des Enfants&quot;) by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont&quot;.

An example of the three wishes motif as a joke runs as follows:

An early version of the joke is found in an 1875 book of Scottish anecdotes. There, a Scottish highlander is asked what his three wishes would be. He first wishes for a lake full of whisky. His second wish is for a similar quantity of good food. When asked for his third wish, after a moment of indecision, he asks for a &quot;second&quot; lake full of whisky.

===Horrific consequences===
The format is not always used for humor. In &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;, a 1902 horror short story by author W. W. Jacobs, the paw of a dead monkey is a talisman that grants its possessor three wishes, but the wishes come with an enormous price. In the story, the recipient of the monkey&#x27;s paw wishes for £200, only to learn that his son has been killed in a terrible work accident, for which the employer makes a goodwill payment of £200. Later, the mother asks that the dead son be wished back to life. Upon hearing strange sounds and a knock at the door, the father realizes that the thing outside would be a horribly mutilated body, and wishes it away with the paw&#x27;s final wish.

<doc id="849651" wikidata="Q6984037" url="?curid=849651" title="Neal A. Maxwell">
<text>Neal Ash Maxwell (July 6, 1926 – July 21, 2004) was an American scholar, educator, and religious leader who served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1981 until his death in 2004.

==Life and career==
Maxwell was born on July 6, 1926, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Clarence Maxwell and Emma Ash. After graduating from Granite High School in 1944 at the height of World War II, Maxwell enlisted in the United States Army. He served in the 77th Division and saw action in the Battle of Okinawa. After the war, Maxwell served for two years as an LDS Church missionary in Canada.

While pursuing an undergraduate education at the University of Utah before leaving on his mission, Maxwell met Colleen Hinckley (1928–2016). After Maxwell returned from his mission, he resumed courting Colleen, and they were married in the Salt Lake Temple on November 22, 1950. They became the parents of four children and had twenty-four grandchildren.

Maxwell earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in political science from the University of Utah. From 1952 to 1956 he worked in Washington, D.C. for the government and then as a legislative assistant to Senator Wallace F. Bennett.

Maxwell was a professor of political science at the University of Utah. He also held many administrative roles at the university. He first joined the university staff as assistant director of public relations in 1956. In 1958, he became Assistant to the President. In 1961, he was secretary to the Board of Trustees, followed by dean of students in 1962, and later vice president for planning and public affairs. In 1967, he became Executive Vice-president of the University of Utah.

==LDS Church service==
From 1959 to 1962, Maxwell served as bishop of Salt Lake City&#x27;s University Sixth Ward. He was a member of the General Board of the YMMIA and a member of the Adult Correlation Committee for the next five years.

In 1967, Maxwell was called to be one of the first 69 regional representatives. From 1970 to 1976, he served as the tenth Commissioner of Church Education overseeing the Church Educational System. Under his direction, the system received its current name.

Maxwell began serving as an LDS general authority in 1974, when he was called as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1976, Maxwell became one of the seven presidents of the seventy, when the calling of Assistant to the Twelve was eliminated.

Maxwell was ordained an apostle by N. Eldon Tanner on July 23, 1981, after Gordon B. Hinckley became a counselor in the First Presidency. He was sustained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on October 3, 1981.

Among his assignments was to preside over the organization of new stakes of the church. One of the more notable was the Aba Nigeria Stake in 1988, with David W. Eka called as president. This was the first stake in the church staffed entirely by people of African descent.

Maxwell wrote approximately 30 books concerning religion and authored numerous articles on politics and government for local, professional and national publications. He was well known for his extensive vocabulary and elegant style of speaking and writing. His highly alliterative talks have always presented a great challenge to translators. During one LDS general conference, the translators had categorized each of the talks to be given into five levels of difficulty. All of the talks were assigned to levels one to four, except Maxwell&#x27;s. His talk was alone at level five. Commenting on his speaking and writing styles at Maxwell&#x27;s funeral, church president Gordon B. Hinckley said,

Maxwell received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Utah; an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Westminster College, Salt Lake City; an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, Utah; an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree from Utah State University, Logan, Utah; an Honorary Degree from Ricks College, Rexburg, Idaho; and an Honorary Degree from Salt Lake Community College.

The University of Utah established the Neal A. Maxwell Presidential Endowed Chair in Political Theory, Public Policy and Public Service in the fall of 1998.

Maxwell&#x27;s business career included serving as a director of several business firms, including Questar Corporation, Questar Pipeline, and Deseret News Publishing Company. He also was active in public service, including service as chairman of the Utah Constitutional Revision Commission.

Maxwell received the Liberty Bell award from the Utah State Bar in 1967 for public service. In 1973, the Institute of Government Service at BYU named him Public Administrator of the Year.

==Death==
Maxwell died in Salt Lake City, from leukemia. He was originally diagnosed with leukemia in 1996, eight years before his death.

An estimated 4,000 people attended the funeral in the Tabernacle or via video in the Salt Lake Assembly Hall or the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. According to Hinckley, Maxwell &quot;accomplished more in these last eight years than most men do in a lifetime.&quot; With the death ten days later of fellow apostle David B. Haight, the vacancies created in the Quorum of the Twelve were filled by Dieter F. Uchtdorf and David A. Bednar.

Maxwell was survived by his wife, Colleen, four children, 24 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

The BYU Institute for the Study and Preservation of Ancient Religious Texts was renamed the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship after Maxwell&#x27;s death.

==Mission highlights==

Pham Tuan of Vietnam arrived with Commander Viktor Gorbatko aboard Salyut 6 in Soyuz 37; they both returned to Earth in the Soyuz 36 spacecraft approximately eight days later. Tuan&#x27;s 30 experiments involved observing Vietnam from space, life sciences (including tests of growth of Vietnamese azolla water ferns, with application to future closed-loop life support systems), and materials processing. The long-duration crew launched in Soyuz 35 returned to Earth in the Soyuz 37 spacecraft at the end of their 186-day mission.

<text>Cesar Epitácio Maia (born June 18, 1945) is a Brazilian politician, notable for having been elected three times for mayor of Rio de Janeiro.

A native of Rio, born in 1945, Maia was forced to leave Brazil in exile during the 1960s on account of his affiliation with the Brazilian Communist Party. Exiled in Chile, he obtained a degree in economics, but the 1973 coup in the country saw him return to his native land. After becoming Professor of Macroeconomics at the Fluminense Federal University in the neighbouring city of Niterói, Maia became active in the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), founded by Leonel Brizola. Maia supported Brizola&#x27;s campaign to become Governor of Rio de Janeiro state in 1983, as Brazil was emerging from the military-led regime towards full democracy, and was subsequently appointed Treasury Secretary for the state.

A trusted personal adviser to Brizola, who was instrumental in uncovering and denouncing the allegedly electoral fraud that threatened Brizola&#x27;s gubernatorial election in 1982, the so-called Proconsult scheme, Maia was to be elected to the national Chamber of Deputies in 1986, and saw re-election in 1990. Meanwhile, having achieved personal political prominence in the late 1980s, Maia broke with Brizola and the PDT, affiliating with the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) in 1991, being elected mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro for the first time in 1992, defeating the Workers&#x27; Party candidate, Afro-Brazilian Benedita da Silva in a run-off election, in a campaign that was regarded by some as being driven by racist ideology. Maia subsequently left the PMDB and joined the Liberal Front Party (PFL).

==Mayoral career==
Maia began his first term as mayor in the wake of an episode that mirrored the strained relationship between the social classes in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called &quot;arrastão&quot; (looting-rampage, or &quot;dragnet&quot;) on October the 18th, which saw rival groups of youths from different shanty towns (&quot;galeras&quot;) and associated with various funk bands (&quot;funkeiros&quot;) sorting out their differences and going on a looting-spree at Ipanema beach. Maia ran as a law and order candidate, and after his inauguration tried a &quot;no-nonsense&quot; attitude, focused on new directions on public administration and urban intervention. He frequently courted media attention through the use of so-called factoids; small antics that went from the eccentric to the ridiculous, for example his proposed special monetary unit, legal tender only in Rio de Janeiro. Given the bizarre character of some of these antics, some say that Maia from the start &quot;wanted to build an image purposely intended to appear as surprising as well as strange&quot;.

In his first term, Maia focused on projects such as &quot;&quot;, an urban renewal initiative targeting the city&#x27;s commercial districts. The renewal would involve sidewalk repair and replacements, urban furnishings, street lights, landscaping, as well as aesthetic redesigning of each neighbourhood to give each its own specific visual identity. Rio-Cidade, however, was from the outset criticised perceived poor architectural choices, such as a giant cast iron obelisk built in Ipanema, together with an elevated causeway across a street that never opened to the public and was eventually razed in 2009 at the locals&#x27; behest. Rio-Cidade intended to provide infrastructure for the expansion of cable TV networks in wealthy districts. Other programs included the construction of a major urban highway called Linha Amarela, as well as the most important urbanization project in the favelas as recognized by UNESCO, Favela-Bairro, a project started with a credit of 180 million US$ from the Inter-American Development Bank.

Favela-Bairro was a programme concerned mostly with providing basic utilities and public services (sewage systems, sidewalks, etc.) to a number of existing shanty towns, while renovating housing and its surroundings in aesthetical terms, as in Rio-Cidade. Favela-Bairro, however, as much as it was presented as a plan for drastic improvement of actual living conditions, was seen as having failed in one of its chief concerns, that of blurring the boundaries between the &quot;formal&quot; city and the shantytown: in the words of scholar Janice Perlman, &quot;there&#x27;s still no doubt about where the &quot;asfalto&quot; ends and the &quot;morro&quot; begins&quot;. At the same time, by stating that &quot;favela&quot; residents could have access to proper urbanism if they behaved in an &quot;orderly&quot; fashion, Favela-Bairro perpetuated the stigma long associated to shantytown dwellers. Finally, Favela-Bairro was also seem as very limited in scope, as it concerned itself with only 27% of all Rio shanty-towns.

After his first mayoral term, which was succeeded by one of his associates, architect Luiz Paulo Conde, Maia chose to distance himself from the legacy of Favela Bairro, and the programme came to be fostered by Conde, who had meanwhile distanced himself from Maia. In the end, Favela Bairro achieved what was called by some as &quot;anecdotal success at best&quot;.
Similar criticism met many of Maia&#x27;s other projects, as in the case of Linha Amarela, an express highway that displaced some 10,000 people to foster private automobile traffic between the Barra da Tijuca district and downtown Rio.

Reelected in 2000 in a runoff election against his former protégé Conde - for which he had meanwhile joined the Brazilian Labour Party - Maia embarked on a project to set a branch of the Guggenheim Museum on the Rio waterfront, a US$200 million project - in partnership with Guggenheim director Thomas Krens - which included a building designed by French architect Jean Nouvel and whose cost would be borne entirely by the city in return for the prestige associated with the Guggenheim brand. The scheme was eventually shelved as a court decision declared the contract between the Rio City Hall and the Guggenheim Foundation to be against Brazilian law, the project being described as &quot;a piece of hubris and folly worthy of Maia&#x27;s Roman namesake&quot;. In his second term, however, Maia embarked in various building schemes, such as &quot;Cidade do Samba&quot; (Samba City) a complex of workshops in Rio&#x27;s docking district to be used by samba schools to prepare for Carnival parades, inaugurated in 2005 - and was partially destroyed by a fire on 7 February 2011; the Luiz Gonzaga Center for Northeastern Traditions, an old pavilion in downtown Rio long used for selling Northeastern traditional foods and wares, refurbished to function both as a market and a showhouse - in what was seem as a &quot;commodification&quot; of traditional culture.

Easily reelected in 2004,this time again on the Democratas party ticket, Maia embarked in a whole gamut of public works linked to the successful Rio candidature for hosting the 2007 Pan American Games, including many works that were hotly contested as authoritarian, environmentally unfriendly, and in collusion with private building interests, such as the proposed works for the Gloria Marina, which included the construction of a huge garage for yachts - as well as a shopping mall - in the landmark protected Aterro do Flamengo area, works which were shelved after being questioned by a public attorney. Works actually concluded, such as the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and others, were regarded by many as simply an embarrassing legacy of &quot;white elephants&quot; - a Brazilian idiom for costly, only-for-show works and without any actual counterpart in urban infrastructure - a result reached after cost overruns that were actually six to ten times the original US$177 million budget. As he finished his term of office in early 2009, Maia also left a legacy of an unfinished and huge (1 million square feet) concert hall in Barra da Tijuca, the Cidade da Música (City of Music), designed by French architect 
Christian de Portzamparc, that had cost some US$220 million and was left unused after it was declared as unsafe by the State&#x27;s Fire Brigade. Finishing work on the City of Music premises continues, with actual inauguration lastly being set tentatively in July 2010, at a grand total cost of R$481.3 million (US$818.2 million); although most of the future activities are to be conceded to private contractors, it&#x27;s forecast that the complex&#x27;s operations will generate public spending in the order of R$247 million (US$420 million) for the next twenty-five years.

During Maia&#x27;s third term, management of the city&#x27;s public hospitals was deemed as so poor that in March 2005 the federal Ministry of Health decreed an intervention in health facilities jointly administered by the federal government and the city, two military field hospitals being set in order to deal with the ongoing jam. In early 2008, a dengue fever epidemic hit Rio, taking 54 lives at the three first months of the year, despite Maia&#x27;s declaring it to be a purely local occurrence at the same time charging the Minister of Health of &quot;criminal neglect&quot; for supposedly having failed to forewarn Rio of the coming disease outbreak. In late March 2008, Maia traveled to Salvador and declared that he had &quot;prayed to the Senhor do Bonfim to blow away the Rio mosquitos to the sea&quot; and that he had travelled to Bahia &quot;in order to bring Rio the strong spiritual vibes we have here&quot;.

Also in early 2008, Maia had to face a citizens&#x27; boycott on the property tax on real state assets (IPTU).

==2008 and 2010 Political setbacks==
The poor evaluation of his third term eventually made Maia unable to exert a meaningful influence in the 2008 mayoral elections, in which his party&#x27;s candidate, Maia&#x27;s Secretary of Housing Solange Amaral fared a poor sixth in the elections&#x27; first round, with 3.92% of the valid ballots. In 2010 Maia ran for the Senate and, in the race for two senatorial seats, came fourth, with 11% of the State&#x27;s voting, in what was described as the worst defeat of his whole career.

<doc id="849675" wikidata="Q22847" url="?curid=849675" title="Rotisserie">
<text>Rotisserie, also known as spit-roasting, is a style of roasting where meat is skewered on a spit – a long, solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire, or roasted in an oven. This method is generally used for cooking large joints of meat or entire animals, such as pigs or turkeys. The rotation cooks the meat evenly in its own juices and allows easy access for continuous basting.

==History==

In medieval cuisine and early modern kitchens, the spit was the preferred way of cooking meat in a large household. A servant, preferably a boy, sat near the spit turning the metal rod slowly and cooking the food; he was known as the &quot;spit boy&quot; or &quot;spit jack&quot;. Mechanical turnspits (&quot;roasting jacks&quot;) were later invented, first powered by dogs on treadmills, and then by steam power and mechanical clockwork mechanisms. The spit could also be powered by a turbine mounted in the chimney with a worm transmission for torque and speed conversion. Spits are now usually driven by electric motors.

Rotisserie can also refer to a mechanical device used for rotisserie cooking, or to a restaurant specializing in spit-roasted meat. The word comes from French where it first appeared in Paris shops around 1450. Additionally, in restaurants employing the Escoffierian &quot;brigade de cuisine&quot;, the rotisseur is the chef responsible for all spit-roasted, oven roasted, grilled and in some cases fried foods.

==Horizontal rotisserie==
This style mounts the spit horizontally. They are often used to cook whole chickens or roasts of various meats including beef and pork. The design may include a single spit mounted over an open broiler or grill, a single spit mounted within an otherwise-conventional oven, or many spits mounted within a large industrial oven. The latter are commonly used to mass-produce roasted meats for sale to consumers.

In this style of rotisserie, balance is important. If the object to be cooked is far out of balance, it will impose a heavy load on the drive mechanism or cause the mechanism to fail to turn. Loose chicken legs or wings can also cause the mechanism to jam. For these two reasons, some skewering skill is required.
High-end consumer ovens commonly come with a rotisserie (or allow the installation of a rotisserie as an option). In these cases, the motor drive mechanism is usually concealed within the oven. The rotisserie is used by removing the normal cooking racks; a special carrier may be needed to provide one or both bearing points for the spit.

The speed of rotation can vary, depending on the type of food being cooked and proximity to the heat source. Large animals, such as whole pigs, are often cooked at speeds ranging from 3 rpm to 1 rpm. Ron Popeil, inventor of the Ronco &quot;Showtime&quot; rotisserie oven, claims that 6 rpm is an ideal speed for cooking a variety of food.

Generally speaking, when a whole animal is being spit roasted, it is best rotated faster in the early part of the roasting, to help interior temperature rise without burning the exterior. Once the exterior has started to crust, then the rate of rotation is adjusted down so as to minimize dripping. This allows juices and drippings to stay on, thus maximizing flavor. The latter is particularly important if using a horizontal spit and coals or an open fire, in which case the drippings cannot be salvaged for basting. For a horizontal spit, it is also preferable to keep the roast further away from the heat source in the beginning, which minimizes infrared heating while preserving air convection heating. Later on, the roast is brought closer, thus combining intense convection and radiation heating.

Supermarkets commonly mass-produce rotisserie chickens using a horizontal rotisserie that has metal bars to hold the chicken in place through the weakest part of the breast (also which hardly affects the meat itself from the impaling, but still holds the chicken firmly in place) and the densest part of the chicken (located just below the drumstick of the chicken).

==Vertical rotisserie==

Another style of rotisserie is the vertical rotisserie in which the heat is applied directly from the side or, less commonly, convected up from below. In this style of rotisserie, balance of the load is less important than with a horizontal rotisserie; this feature is useful, as the meat is typically shaved off a bit at a time.

Some dishes that are commonly cooked on a vertical rotisserie include:

* Döner kebab from Turkey
* Gyros, from Greece
* Shawarma, from the Middle East and the Arab World
* Taco al pastor, from Mexico

<text>Orlando Ramírez Leal (born December 18, 1951), nicknamed as &quot;El Ñato&quot; (Snub Nose), is a Colombian former Major League Baseball shortstop who played for the California Angels between 1974 and 1979. He was the first recognized Colombian-born player in major league history, following Luis Castro, who played 42 games for the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1902 season.

In his 143-game major league career, Ramírez batted .189 with 16 RBI, 24 runs, five doubles, one triple and 16 stolen bases. On the international stage, he led the Colombian national team at the Baseball World Cup and Pan American Games.

== Professional career ==
Ramírez began his career with the Willard club from Barranquilla, Colombia in 1966 which was recognized as the top level of Colombian baseball.

Ramírez first played for the Shreveport Captains in the Texas League, the Double-A affiliate of the California Angels. He excelled and was transferred to the Idaho Falls Angels in the Pioneer Rookie League. From Idaho Falls, he was sent to the minors in 1973, playing for the Quad Cities Angels where he soon played Double-A again in 1974. A short time after playing Double-A, Ramírez was promoted to the majors.

==International career==
At the age of 17, Ramírez made the Colombian national team and debuted in his first game in the 1969 Amateur World Series held in Santo Domingo. He batted third and played third base on the Colombian national team. In the 1970 and 1971 Amateur World Series, Ramírez played shortstop and led all players in stolen bases. He led the Colombian national team to a silver medal in the 1971 tournament, held in Havana. He also won a bronze medal at the 1971 Pan American Games.

==Colombian significance==
Ramírez was inducted in the Colombian Baseball Hall of Fame in September 2009. He was the first Colombian to play in the Major Leagues. The Colombian Professional Baseball League Most Valuable Player award has been in his name since the winter of 2005-06.

<doc id="849683" wikidata="Q79961" url="?curid=849683" title="Christ the Redeemer (statue)">
<text>Christ the Redeemer (, ) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is high, excluding its pedestal. The arms stretch wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.

The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. This statue is the largest Art Deco–style sculpture in the world. A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.

== History ==

Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid-1850s to honor Princess Isabel, regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was not approved. In 1889, the country became a republic, and owing to the separation of church and state, the proposed statue was dismissed.

The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a landmark statue on the mountain in 1920. The group organized an event called &quot;Semana do Monumento&quot; (&quot;Monument Week&quot;) to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The organization was motivated by what they perceived as &quot;Godlessness&quot; in the society. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the &quot;Statue of the Christ&quot; included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. Eventually, the statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms, a symbol of peace, was chosen.

Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and artist Carlos Oswald designed the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work.

In 1922, Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in Bucharest and in Italy. A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski&#x27;s submissions, and they felt building the structure out of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931, and cost the equivalent of and the monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed away in Rome but because of bad weather, the lights were activated on site.

In October 2006, on the 75th anniversary of the statue&#x27;s completion, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid, Archbishop of Rio, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil&#x27;s patron saint—Our Lady of the Apparition—under the statue, allowing Catholics to hold baptisms and weddings there.

Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February 10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the statue. Lightning damaged it again on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on the right hand.In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior, restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the monument. Vandals attacked the statue during renovation, spraying paint along the arm. Mayor Eduardo Paes called the act &quot;a crime against the nation&quot;. The culprits later apologized and presented themselves to the police.

In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo&#x27;s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, the Pirelli tyre company ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the statue while in an Inter Milan strip. The commercial was controversial with the Catholic Church.

==Restoration==

In 1990, several organizations, including the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, media company Grupo Globo, oil company Shell do Brasil, environmental regulator 
of IBAMA, National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, and the city government of Rio de Janeiro entered into an agreement to conduct restoration work.

More work on the statue and its environs was conducted in 2003 and early 2010. In 2003, a set of escalators, walkways, and elevators were installed to facilitate access to the platform surrounding the statue. The four-month restoration in 2010 focused on the statue itself. The statue&#x27;s internal structure was renovated and its soapstone mosaic covering was restored by removing a crust of fungi and other microorganisms and repairing small cracks. The lightning rods located in the statue&#x27;s head and arms were also repaired, and new lighting fixtures were installed at the foot of the statue.

The restoration involved one hundred people and used more than 60,000 pieces of stone taken from the same quarry as the original statue. During the unveiling of the restored statue, it was illuminated with green-and-yellow lighting in support of the Brazil national football team playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Maintenance work needs to be conducted periodically because of the strong winds and erosion to which the statue is exposed, as well as lightning strikes. The original pale stone is no longer available in sufficient quantity, and replacement stones are increasingly darker in hue.

<text>Against the Dying of the Light is a 2001 documentary film about the work of the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales.

==Film history==
Consisting of interviews with Welsh directors, actors and public figures about the significance that film (particularly amateur film) has played in their lives, it achieved a limited UK cinema release in 2001.

The film was also shown at a handful of festivals and special screenings around the world, including two at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in London. An intriguing gem, it is still occasionally to be seen at cinemas and film societies in the UK.

The film was directed by Jack Jewers, produced by Jack Jewers, Leo Brend and the (then) head of the archive, Iola Baines. It features interviews with William Lloyd-George, (grandson of David Lloyd George); the actors Rhys Ifans, Donna Edwards and Sue Rodderick; the directors Marc Evans and Karl Francis; and the author Kevin Brownlow.

Jewers described the commissioning of the film as follows:
Jewers recorded that he was struck by &quot;the sheer power and historical value&quot; of the Welsh Film Archive, and &quot;astonished to discover&quot; 8mm film of Hitler meeting David Lloyd George.

Jewers described his approach to the film as:
==Title==

The title of the film comes from a villanelle written for his dying father by the twentieth century Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, &quot;Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night&quot;.

<text>Ludwigsburg Palace, nicknamed the &quot;Versailles of Swabia&quot;, is a 452-room palace complex of 18 buildings located in Ludwigsburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Its total area, including the gardens, is the largest palatial estate in the country. The palace has four wings: the northern wing, the Alter Hauptbau, is the oldest and was used as a residence of the Duke of Württemberg; the east and west wings were used for court purposes and housing guests and courtiers; the southern wing, the Neuer Hauptbau, was built to house more court functions and was later used as a residence.

Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg, appointed Philipp Joseph Jenisch to direct the work, and construction began in 1704. In 1707, Jenisch was replaced by Johann Friedrich Nette, who completed most of the palace and surrounding gardens. Nette died in 1714, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni finished much of the palace façades. In the final year of construction, Eberhard Louis died, and the Neue Hauptbau&#x27;s interiors were left incomplete. Charles Eugene&#x27;s court architect, Philippe de La Guêpière, completed and refurbished parts of the New Hauptbau in the Rococo style, especially the palace theatre. Charles Eugene abandoned the palace for Stuttgart in 1775. Duke Frederick II, later King Frederick I, began using Ludwigsburg as his summer residence in the last years of Charles Eugene&#x27;s reign. Frederick and his wife Charlotte, Princess Royal, resided at Ludwigsburg and employed Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret to renovate the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret converted much of Ludwigsburg&#x27;s interiors over the reign of Frederick and the later life of Charlotte. As a result of each architect&#x27;s work, Ludwigsburg is a combination of Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, and Empire style architecture.

The constitutions of the Kingdom and Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg were ratified at Ludwigsburg Palace, in 1819 and 1919 respectively. It was the residence for four of Württemberg&#x27;s monarchs and some other members of the House of Württemberg and their families. The palace was opened to the public in 1918 and survived World War II intact. It underwent periods of restoration in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1990s and again for the palace&#x27;s 300th anniversary in 2004. The palace had more than 350,000 visitors in 2017 and has hosted the Ludwigsburg Festival every year since 1947.

Surrounding the palace are the Blooming Baroque (&quot;Blühendes Barock&quot;) gardens, arranged in 1954 as they might have appeared in 1800. Nearby is Schloss Favorite, a hunting lodge built in 1717 by Frisoni. Within the palace are two museums operated by the Landesmuseum Württemberg dedicated to fashion and porcelain respectively.

== History ==

&quot;Ludwigsburg&quot;, meaning &quot;Louis&#x27;s castle&quot;, was named after its builder, Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg, in 1705. It was built on the site of a hunting estate and lodge owned by the dukes of Württemberg. This was destroyed by invading French troops in 1692, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, and replaced by another lodge built from 1697 to 1701. The beginning in 1701 of another war, the War of the Spanish Succession, against France and Bavaria, interrupted construction of this lodge, though Württemberg deferred entering the war until late 1702. Württemberg was subsequently invaded by France and Bavaria, but in 1704, the Bavarian elector was defeated at the Battle of Blenheim and exiled, and Bavaria was occupied. Eberhard Louis, a participant of Blenheim and the subsequent occupation, spent the winter of 1705–06 at the elector&#x27;s residence, Nymphenburg Palace. Eberhard Louis used these developments to press claims to Bavarian lands, but illegally occupied the claimed lands. He was further undone by another French invasion of Württemberg in 1707 that resulted in the destruction of his capital and the flight of his family to Switzerland. Eberhard Louis&#x27;s designs were at last defeated by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which restored the territory and title of the Bavarian elector. Unable to compete with Bavaria militarily or politically, and desiring to sideline the influence of the Estates of Württemberg, Eberhard Louis decided instead to compete culturally and build a new palace and town inspired by Versailles, which would be the center of his domestic society and diplomacy. Located from Stuttgart, Eberhard Louis could set up a court with his mistress, Wilhelmine von Grävenitz, and demonstrate his absolutist status as a monarch.

Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace had officially begun in May 1704 with the laying of the Alter Hauptbau&#x27;s cornerstone by Eberhard Louis. The year before, he sent to study architecture abroad, and himself studied architecture while staying at Nymphenburg. Upon Jenisch&#x27;s return the next year, Eberhard Louis appointed him director of construction. Jenisch, however, only managed to finish the Alter Hauptbau&#x27;s (Old main building) first floor and some of the southern garden before falling out of the duke&#x27;s favor in 1707. Jenisch was replaced in 1707 with Johann Friedrich Nette, an engineer. By 1709, it had become apparent that the massive undertaking of the palace&#x27;s construction eventually necessitated the building of a town, also known as Ludwigsburg. That cost of construction provoked financial consequences, opposition at court, and criticism from the populace.

=== Construction ===
Nette was now charged with building a complete Baroque palace from Jenisch&#x27;s central &quot;corps de logis&quot;, to which an east wing and a west wing were to be added, aligned at 11°. Nette based his plans on those of Jenisch, enabling him to complete his design for a three-wing palace in the same year as his appointment. The galleries of the Alter Hauptbau were completed in 1707, then the &quot;corps de logis&quot; the next year. The Ordensbau and Riesenbau were constructed from 1709 to 1713, and their interiors were completed in 1714. Nette began the interior of the Alter Hauptbau, which he would never finish. Construction of the building&#x27;s pavilions dragged on into 1722. Nette made two trips to Prague and his native Brandenburg to expand his pool of talent. He hired , Tomasso Soldati, and Donato Giuseppe Frisoni in 1708, Andreas Quitainner in 1709, and then Luca Antonio Colomba, Riccardo Retti and Diego Francesco Carlone. Nette fled to Paris from an accusation of embezzlement from Jenisch&#x27;s allies but was ordered back to Ludwigsburg by Eberhard Louis. On his return trip, he died suddenly of a stroke on 9 December 1714 in Nancy at the age of 41. At the time of his death, most of the northern section of the modern palace and its northern garden was complete.

Eberhard Louis thwarted an attempt by Jenisch to get the director job again and replaced Nette in 1715 with Frisoni. Frisoni, although having no formal training in architecture, enjoyed the support of the court chamberlain and impressed the duke with his stucco work in the Alter Hauptbau. Frisoni resumed construction with the palace&#x27;s churches, beginning the Schlosskapelle in 1716 and the Ordenskapelle in 1720, then finished the Kavalierbauten in 1722. Frisoni also added the mansard roof to the top of the Alter Hauptbau, as its flat roof was prone to water damage. This had become a common issue with Nette&#x27;s work because of the pressure the duke placed on him to finish the palace as soon as possible. Frisoni&#x27;s work thus far led him to believe that he did not have a large enough talent pool to satisfy the duke&#x27;s desires for the palace and town, so Frisoni brought in Giacomo Antonio Corbellini and Paolo Retti, his brother and son-in-law respectively, who were followed by Diego Francesco Carlone in 1718.

In 1721, the duke began to run out of room in the Alter Hauptbau for the functions of his court and Frisoni began planning to enlarge it. The duke dismissed the idea in 1724 and ordered Frisoni to construct the Neuer Hauptbau. Frisoni designed a four-story structure, double the height of the existing palace, but plans changed several times after construction began in 1725 atop the first terrace of the south garden. Frisoni settled on a three-story building that still afforded Eberhard Louis six rooms for his suite to the three in the Alter Hauptbau. To connect the Neuer Hauptbau to the existing palace, Frisoni built the Bildergalerie and Festinbau on the west side, and the Ahnengalerie and Schlosstheater (Palace theater) on the east. The Bildergalerie and Ahnengalerie were decorated from 1731 to 1733. With the exception of the interiors of the Neuer Hauptbau and Schlosstheater, all work was finished in 1733, but Eberhard Louis died that same year. Only a few rooms in the west end of the Neuer Hauptbau had been completed when he died. Construction of the Neuer Hauptbau and its connecting galleries cost 465,000 guilders and was managed by Paolo Retti, who at times had more than 650 stone masons, cutters, and basic laborers working on the facades between 1726 and 1728. Construction of Ludwigsburg Palace cost the Duchy of Württemberg 3,000,000 florins.

=== Residence ===
Eberhard Louis left no heirs and was succeeded by Charles Alexander. Charles Alexander ended funding for the palace, dismissed its staff, and moved the capital back to Stuttgart in 1733 to modernize Württemberg&#x27;s army and fortifications. As central figures in the construction of what was now decried as the &quot;sin palace&quot;, Frisoni and Paolo Retti were arrested in 1733 on fraudulent charges of embezzlement. The two men were acquitted in 1735 after they paid a hefty fine to the ducal treasury, despite attempted intervention by Charles William Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach to free them earlier. Frisoni died in Ludwigsburg on 29 November 1735. Charles Alexander himself died suddenly two years later on 12 March 1737 as he prepared to leave Ludwigsburg Palace to inspect the duchy&#x27;s fortresses. After his death, the nine-year-old Charles Eugene became Duke, beginning a regency that lasted until 1744.

Charles Eugene began the construction of a new palace in Stuttgart in 1746 but unofficially used Ludwigsburg as his residence until 1775. The function of certain rooms at Ludwigsburg changed frequently; converted the Ordenskapelle to a Lutheran church from 1746 to 1748 for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie. Beginning in 1757 and lasting into the next year, the suites of the beletage were extensively modified by Philippe de La Guêpière. La Guêpière completed the Schlosstheater in 1758–59, adding a stage, machinery, and the auditorium. A wooden opera house, adorned with mirrors, was constructed in 1764–65, located east of the Alter Hauptbau. Although Charles Eugene officially declared Ludwigsburg Palace his residence in 1764, he made no further modifications after 1770. The palace that had hosted a court that Giacomo Casanova called &quot;the most magnificent in Europe&quot; began a steady decline. Charles Eugene died without a legitimate heir in 1793 and was succeeded by his brother, Frederick II Eugene, who was succeeded by his son Frederick II in 1797. Ludwigsburg Palace had already been Frederick II&#x27;s summer residence since 1795, and he continued to use it as such with Duchess Charlotte after marrying her on 18 May 1797.

Napoleon&#x27;s armies occupied Württemberg from 1800 to 1801, forcing the duke and duchess to flee to Vienna. The royals returned when Frederick II agreed in 1803 to pledge allegiance to Napoleon and part with Württemberg&#x27;s territory on the Left Bank of the Rhine, an area of . In exchange, according to the Treaty of Lunéville, Frederick II was named a Prince-elector and given of mediatised Right Bank territory. Frederick II, now Elector Frederick I, tasked his court architect Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret with renovating the palace in the Neoclassical style. Thouret started in the Ahengalerie and the Ordensbau, working there from 1803 to 1806. For two days in October 1805, Napoleon visited Ludwigsburg to coerce Frederick I into joining the Confederation of the Rhine and thus becoming his ally, compensating Württemberg with neighboring territories in the Holy Roman Empire and Frederick I with the title of king. Frederick I again tasked Thouret with a remodeling, from 1808 to 1811, of the Ordenskapelle and the king&#x27;s apartment. The final modernizations ordered by the king took place from 1812 to 1816 in the Schlosstheater and Marble Hall. During this time, the ceiling frescoes of the Guard Room and the main staircases of the Neuer Hauptbau were repainted. By the time Frederick I died in 1816, the majority of the palace had been converted to reflect the latest style.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Charlotte continued to reside at Ludwigsburg, receiving visitors such as her siblings. She tasked Thouret with the renovation of her own apartment, which was carried out between 1816 and 1824. The dowager queen died at the palace on 5 October 1828 following a bout of apoplexy. Charlotte was the last ruler of Württemberg to reside at Ludwigsburg, as Frederick&#x27;s son and successor, William I, and future kings did not show any interest in the palace. Members of the House of Württemberg continued to reside at the palace into the early 20th century, while the Württembergs moved to Bebenhausen Abbey after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.

=== Later history ===
In 1817, ownership of Ludwigsburg Palace passed from the House of Württemberg to the government of the Kingdom of Württemberg, which established offices there the next year. King William I chose the Order Hall, the throne room of his father, for the ratification of the kingdom&#x27;s constitution in 1819. The palace&#x27;s first restoration took place at the Alter Hauptbau in 1865.

On 9 November 1918, the Kingdom of Württemberg was dissolved with the abdication of King William II. Ludwigsburg Palace was opened to the public that same year and a new constitution was ratified for the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg on 12 January 1919. At this time, two apartments at Ludwigsburg Palace were still occupied by members of the House of Württemberg, Duke Ulrich and Princess Olga. The new state ordered them vacated until 1 April for the ratification. Ulrich moved out of Ludwigsburg in January, but Olga rented a new suite in the Neuer Hauptbau in February. She continued to reside at Ludwigsburg in her apartment with her family until her death in 1932.

The Schlosstheater hosted the Württemberg State Theatre for a production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rodelinda&quot; in 1923, the first musical performance at the palace since 1853. In the early 1930s, began hosting the Ludwigsburger Schloßkonzerte (Ludwigsburg Palace Concerts), which comprised six to ten concerts annually from 1933 to 1939. The palace survived World War II unscathed, though its furnishings were removed in 1944–45 and held at the monasteries at Alpirsbach and Lorch. It was chosen as the site of the Borkum Island war crimes trial in 1946. The concerts resumed in 1947 with 34 performances, a record that would not be broken until 1979. In 1952, the concerts were packed into a single week as the Ludwigsburger Schloßtage (&quot;Palace Days&quot;). They gained national significance when President Theodor Heuss attended a production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Titus&quot; two years later. The concerts were named Ludwigsburger Schloßfestspiele in 1966, and were internationally known as the Ludwigsburg Festival. In 1980, the state of Baden-Württemberg made the festival an official state event. On 9 September 1962, French President Charles de Gaulle delivered his &quot;speech to the German youth&quot; in the courtyard of Ludwigsburg Palace to 20,000 people.

Restorations were undertaken in the 1950s and 1960s and again in the 1990s, in time for the palace&#x27;s tricentenary in 2004. The anniversary was commemorated by the state government with three new museums. On 19 October 2011, Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann hosted a reception for the U.S. Army&#x27;s 21st Theater Sustainment Command at the palace, which was attended by John D. Gardner, former deputy commander of EUCOM, and , commander of all German troops in Baden-Württemberg. Ludwigsburg appeared again on Federal postage stamps in the series. The 50th anniversary of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s speech at Ludwigsburg was celebrated on 22 September 2012 and included appearances by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Minister-President Kretschmann, and French President François Hollande. Merkel and Hollande both spoke at the event, the former directly referencing de Gaulle&#x27;s speech in French. A painting of Frederick the Great on display was found to be a rare original by Antoine Pesne in November 2017. Michael Hörrmann – the director of the – valued the portrait at a minimum of €1 million. Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Edith Sitzmann visited Ludwigsburg to see the painting and attend a press conference, where she spoke about the cultural importance of Ludwigsburg Palace.

In 2017, 350,642 people visited Ludwigsburg Palace. By March 2020, Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Baden-Württemberg plans to have spent €4 million to furnish the Neuer Hauptbau as it would have been during the reign of King Frederick I. To this end, about 500 paintings, 400 pieces of furniture, and 500 lamps, clocks, and sculptures – will be sourced, sorted, and restored.

As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, Staatliche Schlösser und Garten announced on 17 March 2020 the closure of all its monuments and cancellation of all events until 3 May. Monuments began reopening in early May, from 1 May to 17 May.

== Architecture ==
Ludwigsburg Palace&#x27;s Baroque architecture was built under Eberhard Louis from 1704 to 1733 and is characterized by a great deal of Austrian and Czech Baroque influence. This is most evident in the two churches, which resemble the of Kuks and the of Steyr. The palace&#x27;s two Baroque architects, Johann Friedrich Nette and Donato Frisoni, were educated and worked in Bohemia and hired staff experienced in the Bohemian style. Frisoni even knew or was related to some of the artisans who worked at the Steyr church. French influence is also present, for example in the mirror halls in both the &quot;corps de logis&quot; and the palace&#x27;s many mansard roofs. The combination of work by Germans (Philipp Jenisch and Nette) and Italians (Frisoni, Diego and Carlo Carlone, , Scotti and Luca Antonio Colomba) produced a strong resemblance to late 17th century works in Prague and Vienna. Charles Eugene brought the Rococo style to Ludwigsburg in 1747 and his court architect, Philippe de La Guêpière, worked in that style until 1775.

Nikolaus Friedrich von Thouret, working with Antonio Isopi, renovated much of Ludwigsburg Palace for Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde from 1797 to 1824. Thouret&#x27;s work was heavily influenced by the French Imperial and Renaissance styles, the work of Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, and Egyptian motifs that became popular in Europe with Napoleon&#x27;s three-year Egyptian campaign. Isopi would simplify Thouret&#x27;s plans, which were then carried out by the Biedermeier woodworker Johannes Klinckerfuß and court painter Jean Pernaux. As a result, the palace&#x27;s Neoclassical architecture does not reflect a single style or correspond to any one designer.

=== North wing (Alter Hauptbau) ===
The north wing, referred to as the Alter Hauptbau (Old Main building), is the oldest portion of the palace. It was originally built to house the apartments of Eberhard Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. Its facade was built from 1705 to 1708 and its interiors were mostly completed by 1715, although work inside its pavilions lasted into 1722. In 1809, and from 1826 to 1828, the rooms facing the courtyard in the &quot;beletage&quot; (main floor) were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but their Baroque frescoes were revealed in 1865. The &quot;corps de logis&quot; opens with a wide vestibule, decorated by Frisoni in 1712, that terminates in an unadorned staircase. At the top of the stairs is a guard room and the four suites on the &quot;beletage&quot;. These follow the French Baroque model of a living room, audience chamber, and bedroom. Eberhard Louis&#x27;s apartment features a hall of mirrors decorated with stucco by Frisoni and a hidden staircase, since removed, into the room of his mistress Wilhelmine von Grävenitz. The third floor, finished in 1708, houses two galleries. The first takes up most of the south wall and served as a portrait gallery and &quot;ahnentafel&quot; (table of ancestors), with stucco portraits of Eberhard Louis and his ancestors created by Frisoni and Soldati in 1713. The ceiling frescoes were lost in the 1808 renovation that divided into smaller rooms. The gallery was restored between 2000 and 2004. Above the third floor is a mansard roof that now houses Zwiefalten Abbey&#x27;s original clockwork, taken by King Frederick I in 1809.

The two pavilions to the west and east of the &quot;corps de logis&quot; are connected to it by arcaded galleries, completed in 1713 and 1715 respectively, that close off the northern edge of the &quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;. The western gallery celebrates peace with stucco statuary, medallions, and reliefs of the Judgement of Paris, Aeneas fleeing Troy, Hercules and Omphale, and Apollo and Daphne. Its terminus, the Jagdpavillon (Hunting pavilion), contains the &quot;Marmorsaletta&quot; (Little marble hall) decorated with scagliola by Riccardo Retti and frescoes by Luca Antonio Colomba. Adjoined to the hall are three cabinet rooms, the first and third of which are decorated with Turkish and Chinese imagery respectively. The eastern gallery celebrates war with stucco trophy captives and weapons, reliefs of Eberhard Louis&#x27;s monogram, and depictions of the cardinal virtues and the classical elements. Spanning the entire gallery is Colomba&#x27;s ceiling fresco of the war between the Olympian gods and the giants. At the end of the gallery is the Spielpavillon, completed in 1716, whose center is a rounded, cruciform hall with four corner rooms that contain imitation Delftware images of Jacques Callot&#x27;s &quot;Grotesque Dwarves&quot;. The dome fresco by Colomba and depicts the four seasons and their corresponding zodiac signs.

=== East wing ===
The first structure of the eastern wing is the Riesenbau (Giants&#x27; building), built by Johann Friedrich Nette in 1712–13. The vestibule, decorated by Andreas Quittainer and Colomba, prominently features two sphinxes and four giants as the atlases under the staircase to the &quot;beletage&quot;. Originally, these stairs led up to a room for the Hunting Order, which was segregated into residences from 1720 to 1723. Ahead of the giants is a statue of Minerva, and the frescoes on the ceiling above the staircase show Justitia and Fortitudo, the four seasons, and the four classical elements. In 1810, the rooms on the &quot;beletage&quot; were remodeled in the Neoclassical style, but they were restored to the Baroque style and opened as a museum in the 1950s. The apartments of Frederick Louis and Charles Alexander were decorated by Frisoni and Colomba, but Charles Alexander&#x27;s apartment also features a landscape painting by Adolf Friedrich Harper.

Directly south of the Riesenbau is the Östlicher Kavalierbau (East Cavaliers&#x27; Building), built from 1715 to 1719 for housing courtiers. It contains four apartments on both floors, decorated with stucco ornament by Riccardo Retti and an original fresco on the ceiling of the &quot;beletage&quot; by Leopoldo Retti. The southwestern apartment on the second floor contains a museum dedicated to the Schlosstheater (Palace theater), attached by a gallery to the Östlicher Kavalierbau and the Schlosskapelle. Europe&#x27;s oldest theater was constructed by Frisoni from 1729 to 1733 but was first furnished in 1758–59 by La Guêpière, who added the stage, auditorium, and machinery. Thouret remodeled the Schlosstheater in Neoclassical in 1811–12. Casanova is known to have visited the Schlosstheater, making notes on the performances held there.

The Schlosskapelle (Palace chapel) was built from 1716 to 1724. The chapel is made up of a rotunda with three semi-domes and a private box for the duke and his family, accessed from the second floor. The box was painted around 1731 with the story of David and given its red velvet wallpaper and a ceiling fresco by Livio Retti. The chapel was painted by Frisoni, Colomba, and Carlo Carlone, who were restricted by Protestant doctrine to illustrations of biblical topics, such as the Apostles and scenes from the Old Testament. A crypt under the chapel is the burial site of all rulers of Württemberg from Duke Eberhard Louis to King Frederick I. The Schlosskapelle did not receive any major remodeling in the 19th century.

The southernmost part of the east wing is the Ahnengalerie, built in 1729 and long. The original ceiling frescoes by Carlo Carlone, which illustrate the story of Achilles, were moved to the Bildergalerie after their completion in 1732. Instead, Carlone painted an homage to Eberhard Louis from 1731 to 1733, glorifying his reign with depictions of Alexander the Great, Apelles, Venus, Mars, Apollo, Phobos, and the Muses, among others. Frederick I had Thouret remodel the Ahnengalerie in 1805–06, retaining Carlone&#x27;s frescoes and adding stucco to the two antechambers. The portraits in the Ahnengalerie trace the lineage of the rulers of Württemberg from Eberhard I the Bearded, the first Duke of Württemberg, to Wilhelm II, the last King of Württemberg.

=== West wing ===
The first building of the west wing is the Ordensbau (Order building, in reference to the ducal Order of the Golden Eagle), containing three apartments on the ground floor and the banquet hall. The vestibule features a ceiling fresco of Pheme with a genius. Pictures of Hercules adorn its walls and continue into the stairwell. The antechamber of the Order Hall is decorated with stucco reliefs of cherubs, masks, birds, and weapons by Tomasso Soldati and Frisoni. The Order Hall&#x27;s stucco was also by Soldati and Frisoni, but the ceiling fresco is a later repainting by Scotti and Baroffio in 1731, as the original by Colomba was damaged by water and removed. King Frederick I had the Hall renovated into a throne room in 1805–06 and moved the ceremonies of the Order to the Ordenskapelle. Thouret designed the king&#x27;s throne and baldachin, opposite &#x27;s 1808 portrait of the king. It was in the Order Hall that the constitutions of the Kingdom and the Free People&#x27;s State of Württemberg were ratified in 1819 and 1919, respectively.

Immediately southwest of the Ordensbau is the oval Ordenskapelle (Order chapel), built from 1715 to 1723. The Ordenskapelle was remodeled from 1746 to 1748 by on behalf of Duke Charles Eugene for Duchess Elisabeth Fredericka. Leger removed the floor between the chapel and a second-floor Order hall and reused existing pilasters for new Rococo decor by Pietro Brilli. Retti painted scenes from the life of Jesus on the ceiling. On the second floor is the duchess&#x27;s box, decorated in 1747–48 with stucco and frescoes of the birth of Christ and allegories of faith, hope, and love. In 1798, Frederick I moved the Ordenskapelle&#x27;s church functions to the Schlosskapelle. Nine years later, he designated it for use by the Order of the Golden Eagle and tasked Thouret with remodeling it in the Empire style. Thouret walled up the first-floor windows in 1807–08 for additional seating room and for the king&#x27;s canopied throne under its star-studded semidome.

The Westlicher Kavalierbau (West Cavaliers&#x27; building) is attached to the Ordenskapelle, identical in layout and design to its eastern counterpart. It was built in 1719–20, and retains some original stucco and ceiling frescoes by Riccardo and Retti. The Festinbau, attached to the Westlicher Kavalierbau, was originally designed as a kitchen built from 1729 to 1733, and used from 1770 to 1775 as a theater. Since 2004, the Westlicher Kavalierbau and Festinbau have housed a fashion museum. The actual kitchen, the Küchenbau, was built separate from the palace to its west, to keep odors and possible fires at bay. Inside are seven hearths, a bakery, a butcher&#x27;s shop, several pantries, and the quarters for the servant staff in the attic and on the first floor.

The Bildergalerie (Picture gallery), the southernmost part of the west wing, was built by Frisoni in 1731–32. The only remaining Baroque decor is Scotti&#x27;s ceiling fresco depicting the life of Achilles, which first adorned the ceiling of the Ahnengalerie. Thouret renovated the Bildergalerie in Tuscan Neoclassicism from 1803 to 1805, adding a fireplace by Isopi and a statue of Apollo opposite it. The frescoes in the Bildergalerie&#x27;s antechambers were painted in 1730 by either Scotti or Carlo Carlone.

=== South wing (Neuer Hauptbau) ===
The south wing, the Neuer Hauptbau (New Main building), was designed and constructed by Frisoni on the order of Duke Eberhard Louis, who found that the Alter Hauptbau was too small to serve the needs of his court. Frisoni planned for a four-story building in 1725 but wound up building three stories. Eberhard Louis died before he could move into the Neuer Hauptbau, leaving its interiors unfinished until Duke Charles Eugene finished them in 1747, but abandoned the palace in 1775. The next royals to reside there were Württemberg&#x27;s first King and Queen, Frederick I and Charlotte Mathilde, who extensively remodeled parts of the palace in the Neoclassical style from 1802 to 1824. The building was used in 1944–45 to store furnishings recovered from the recently destroyed New Palace in Stuttgart.

The Neuer Hauptbau opens with an oval vestibule decorated by Carlo Carlone. It houses a statue of Duke Eberhard Louis, surrounded by terms supporting the ceiling. In the niches behind the columns are statues of Apollo, a woman and a sphinx, and two maenads with a satyr. A vaulted passageway decorated with two figures of Hercules leads into a salon, featuring a ceiling fresco by Diego Carlone and statues of Roman deities in niches. The King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Staircases bookend the vestibule and lead up to the Neuer Hauptbau&#x27;s &quot;beletage&quot;. The King&#x27;s Staircase has statuary themed after unhappy romances, and the cavettos above are adorned with stucco depictions of the seasons personified and medals bearing Eberhard Louis&#x27;s initials. The Queen&#x27;s Staircase is a mirror of the King&#x27;s, but the statuary depicts virtues and the ribbonwork above displays Apollo, Artemis, and the four classical elements.

Two galleries lead from the stairs to a guardroom decorated by Diego Carlone in 1730 with stucco weapon trophies and fresco. Thouret covered over Carlone&#x27;s work with Neoclassical ornamentation in 1815. The guardroom leads into the Marble Hall (&quot;Marmorsaal&quot;), the palatial dining hall once used to receive Francis II of Austria and Alexander I of Russia. Thouret began work here in 1813–14 by installing a new, curved ceiling and finished two years later with the Marble Hall&#x27;s scagliola walls. Pilasters and windows form the lower wall, decorated with stucco garlands and candelabras by Antonio Isopi. Reproductions of the &quot;Medusa Rondanini&quot;, &quot;Hermes Ludovisi&quot;, and the Medici Vase are present around the doors. Above the hall is a walkway in the attica, divided by pillars clad with caryatids holding plates and pitchers designed by Johann Heinrich von Dannecker. The ceiling fresco, by Pernaux, is of a partly cloudy blue sky that contains an eagle and four smaller birds that each hoist a chandelier. The roof above the Marble Hall, though curved, has no visible supports. This was achieved by cantilevering its weight upon the entablatures at the top of the walls of the Marble Hall.

To the east of the Marble Hall is Queen Charlotte&#x27;s apartment, originally the suites intended to house Prince Frederick Louis and Princess Henrietta Maria. When Charlotte joined Frederick I in residence at Ludwigsburg in 1798, the separating walls were removed to form one suite. Thouret only made small changes to the queen&#x27;s suite from 1802 to 1806, principally adding damask to the primary antechamber and to the assembly and audience rooms. Extensive renovations, lasting from 1816 to 1824, came after the queen fully established herself at Ludwigsburg. Charlotte&#x27;s audience chamber contains her throne, red silk walls, and paintings of Cybele, Minerva, and personified virtues by over the doors and in the lunettes of the mirrors. The adjacent bedroom was remodeled in 1824 with marbled green pilasters and an alcove containing red silk from 1760. The study is unusual for a Neoclassical interior because of its large mirrors. Finally, there is the summer study and the queen&#x27;s library, remodeled in 1818 with blue damask and Rococo overdoors that carry over into the library to the west. The entire apartment is furnished in the Biedermeier style by Johannes Klinckerfuß, whose work Charlotte herself covered with embroidery.

The king&#x27;s apartment, to the west of Charlotte&#x27;s, was to house Duke Eberhard Louis and Wilhelmine von Grävenitz, and later Johanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach. Charles Eugene became the first to reside here in 1744 with his wife. When Frederick I took up residence, he had Thouret remodel his 12-room suite from 1802 to 1811. The suite opens with the antechamber, containing decorations dated to 1785, likely taken from Hohenheim Palace, and an original ceiling fresco by Carlo Carlone of Bacchus and Venus. Adjacent to it is the audience chamber, decorated with Baroque red damask and Neoclassical borders. The room contains Frederick&#x27;s throne and furniture by Isopi, embellished with griffins in relief. Past the conference room and its Rococo overdoors by Heideloff are the king&#x27;s bedchambers. The Baroque wooden wall paneling and overdoors survived the room&#x27;s 1811 remodeling. The walls and furnishings of the king&#x27;s office are Neoclassical, decorated with the heads of Greek gods and cornucopias, but the ceiling fresco is a Guibal original from 1779 of Chronos and Clio.

Duke Charles Eugene moved into the Neuer Hauptbau in 1757 and tasked La Guêpière with the apartment&#x27;s decoration. Two years later, La Guêpière completed the entire suite except for the bedchamber, as the Duke occupied his wife&#x27;s former suite in 1760 for his actual residence. The rest of the suite was used for social functions until it was emptied of furnishings in the next decade. A staircase and antechamber lead to the entrance of today&#x27;s apartment, a gallery decorated by Ludovico Bossi. The initial rooms are the first and second antechambers, clad in green damask with portraits by Antoine Pesne and paneling by Michel Fressancourt, overdoors by Matthäus Günther, boiserie flooring, and furniture by Jacques-Philippe Carel and Jean-Baptiste Hédouin that Charles Eugene acquired around 1750. The Assembly Room, restored in 2003, prominently features overdoors by Adolf Friedrich Harper and trophies of musical instruments above the windows. Charles Eugene&#x27;s third-floor residence begins with the Corner Room, again painted by Harper, which feeds into a cabinet room and then finally the bedchamber, completed in 1770. Bossi created the ceiling&#x27;s stucco in 1759–60, but the room and its two closets took another decade to complete. Additional rooms on the third floor housed relatives of the rulers of Württemberg and these have been occupied by the Ceramics Museum since 2004.

== Grounds and gardens ==
The gardens were to be centered in the north with an Italian terraced garden and were largely completed when Eberhard Louis turned his attention to the south garden. There he laid out a large symmetrical French garden. Charles Eugene filled in the terraces in 1749 to replace them with a large &quot;broderie&quot;. He then reorganized and expanded the south garden over the next decade. Frederick I again reorganized the south garden in 1797 in a Neoclassical style and Mediterranean theme. He retained the original pathways, but added a canal and fountain to the garden&#x27;s center. The south garden was divided into four equally sized lawns, with hillocks in their center topped with a large vase crafted by Antonio Isopi. Frederick also expanded the garden east to form an English landscape garden (Lower east) and demolished Charles Eugene&#x27;s opera house to form a medieval-themed landscape garden (Upper east). Two additional gardens, for Frederick and Charlotte, were laid out adjacent to their palace suites. Also in the fantasy garden is the Emichsburg, a folly built from 1798 to 1802 and named after the fabled ancestor of the House of Württemberg, a knight of the House of Hohenstaufen. William I abandoned Ludwigsburg for Rosenstein Palace in Stuttgart and opened the south garden to the public in 1828. The canal was filled in and an orchard planted on the southern lawns, later used to grow potatoes.

In 1947, , Director of the State Parks and Gardens Authority, was charged with maintaining the gardens. After visiting the 1951 Bundesgartenschau in Hanover, he decided to restore the gardens. Schöchle convinced Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s Minister of Finance to help fund the venture in 1952 on the condition that the town of Ludwigsburg also assisted. Ludwigsburg&#x27;s mayor, , and the town council agreed to this stipulation. Frank approved the start of work on 23 March 1953, but it lasted late into the year. The restoration of the garden required the moving of of earth by bulldozers supplied and operated by American soldiers and the planting of tens of thousands of trees and hedges, 22,000 roses, and 400,000 other flowers. The Blooming Baroque (&quot;Blühendes Barock&quot;) gardens were opened on 23 April 1954 as a special horticultural show and attracted more than 500,000 visitors by the end of May, among them President Theodor Heuss. When the show closed in the fall of 1954, it had recouped all but 150,000 Deutsche Marks of the investment in the restoration of the gardens and became a permanent landmark. The opening of the Fairy-Tale Garden and its recreations of fairy-tales in 1959 was also an immediate success and increased revenue by 50% for that year. The Blooming Baroque gardens, covering an area of , attract 520,000 to 550,000 visitors annually.

=== Schloss Favorite ===

By 1710 Eberhard Louis had decided to use Ludwigsburg as his main residence, but he still desired a hunting retreat. Inspired by a garden palace he had seen in Vienna, he tasked Frisoni with the design of a new Rococo palace on a hill to the north of Ludwigsburg. Frisoni largely completed Favorite within that year but was unable to complete his extensive plans for its grounds. Only the roads to the main palace and to Monrepos Palace were laid out. In 1800, the interior was remodeled by Thouret for Frederick I. Only one room, in the western half of the building, retains its original baroque appearance. When Frederick was appointed an elector in 1803 and then a king in 1806, he chose both times to celebrate the occasion at Schloss Favorite. Favorite fell into disrepair in the 20th century but was extensively restored from 1972 to 1982.

=== Museums ===
On the first and third floors of the Alter Hauptbau is the Baroque Gallery (&quot;Barockgalerie&quot;), a subsidiary museum of the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart opened in 2004. It displays 120 paintings, some of which are originals from a purchase Duke Charles Alexander made in 1736 of about 400 paintings from . Examples of German and Italian Baroque paintings on display include Martin van Meytens&#x27;s portrait of Charles Alexander, works by Johann Heinrich Schönfeld, Carl Borromäus Andreas Ruthart, Johann Heiss, and Katharina Treu, as well as works that formerly were in the collection of Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

The Landesmuseum Württemberg maintains two subsidiary museums at Ludwigsburg Palace, the Ceramics Museum and Fashion Museum (&quot;Keramikmuseum&quot; and &quot;Modemuseum&quot;, respectively), both opened in 2004. The first of these takes up all of the third floor of the Neuer Hauptbau except the apartment of Duke Charles Eugene, a space of containing more than 4,500 exhibits of porcelain, ceramics, faience and pottery, and of their history, making it one of the largest collections of ceramics in Europe. It includes 2,000 pieces of original Ludwigsburg porcelain and 800 pieces of maiolica, purchased by Charles Eugene from dealers in Augsburg and Nuremberg. It also includes porcelain from the manufactories at Meissen, Berlin, Sèvres, and Vienna, and 20th century Art Nouveau pieces purchased from six countries since 1950. The Fashion Museum, housed in the Festinbau and West Kavalierbau, displays about 700 pieces of clothing and accessories from the 1750s to the 1960s, including works by Charles Frederick Worth, Paul Poiret, Christian Dior, and Issey Miyake.

On the ground floor of the Neuer Hauptbau is a lapidarium, housing original Baroque statuary by Andreas Quittainer, Johann Wilhelm Beyer and Pierre François Lejeune. Charles Eugene&#x27;s apartment houses the Princess Olga Cabinet Exhibition, exploring the lives of Princess Olga and her family at Ludwigsburg from 1901 to 1932.

&quot;Kinderreich&quot; (Children&#x27;s Kingdom) is an interactive museum that educates children four years and older about life at the court of the Duke of Württemberg. In the Palace Theatre, about 140 original set pieces and props from the 18th and 19th centuries are preserved that were discovered during restoration of the theatre, such as oil lamps used for stage lighting. These items were extensively restored to their original condition from 1987 to 1995, and since 1995 one of the original stage pieces, a winter background, has been used for the &quot;Junge Bühne&quot; (Young stage).

<doc id="849700" wikidata="Q1089959" url="?curid=849700" title="Churrasco">
<text>Churrasco (, ) is the Portuguese and Spanish name for grilled beef prominent in South American and Iberian cuisines, and in particular in Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. The term is also used in other Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries for a variety of different meat products.

The related Brazilian term &quot;churrascaria&quot; (or &quot;churrasquería&quot;) is mostly understood to be a steakhouse restaurant serving grilled meat, many offering as much as one can eat: servers move around the restaurant with skewers, slicing meat onto the customer&#x27;s plate. This serving style is called &quot;espeto corrido&quot; or &quot;rodízio&quot;, and is quite popular in Brazil, especially in southern states like Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Santa Catarina.

==&quot;Churrasco&quot; by country==

In Brazil, &quot;churrasco&quot; is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine and Uruguayan &quot;asado&quot;) which originated in southern Brazil. It uses a variety of meats, pork, sausage and chicken which may be cooked on a purpose-built &quot;churrasqueira&quot;, a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. A home equipped with a churrasqueira is a main selling point for properties in Southern Brazil. Portable &quot;churrasqueiras&quot; are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan &quot;asado&quot;, with a grill support, but many Brazilian &quot;churrasqueiras&quot; do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul).

In Nicaragua, the first immigrant group to introduce the term for this cut of beef to the United States restaurant scene in Miami, Florida as early as the 1950s, it refers to a skirt steak prepared grilled and served with a traditional &quot;chimichurri&quot; sauce made with macerated parsley, garlic, peppers, and olive oil sauce.

In Argentina and Uruguay, a &quot;churrasco&quot; refers to any boneless cut of beef that is sliced slightly thin as a steak and grilled over hot coals or on a very hot skillet.

In the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, it always refers to skirt steak, cooked on a barbecue grill. The &quot;chimichurri&quot; sauce is optional, since the meat is very savory with just a slight hint of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking. In Puerto Rico, it is also customary to replace &quot;chimichurri&quot; sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or &quot;Ajilimójili&quot; sauce.

In Ecuador &quot;churrasco&quot; is a staple food of the Coast Region, especially Guayaquil. The dish&#x27;s main ingredient is the grilled steak that is seasoned with &quot;chimichurri&quot;, it is served with plantains, white rice, French fries, a fried egg, and slices of avocado.

In Guatemala, &quot;churrasco&quot; is regarded as a typical dish, often eaten in familiar gatherings and festive occasions. It is usually served topped with &quot;chirmol&quot;, a red sauce containing chopped tomatoes and onions, and accompanied by corn, guacamole, grilled potatoes, stewed black beans, rice, and tortillas.

In Chile, &quot;churrasco&quot; refers to a thin cut of steak which varies depending on the desired quality of the sandwich. The slices are grilled and served in a -sometimes warmed-local bun (called &quot;marraqueta&quot;, or &quot;pan batido&quot; in Valparaíso), usually accompanied with tomato, avocado, and mayonnaise, in the case of a &quot;churrasco italiano&quot;. Another popular dish, &quot;churrasco a lo pobre&quot; (&quot;poor man&#x27;s churrasco&quot;), consists of a &quot;churrasco&quot; served with French fries, fried egg, and caramelized onions.

In Portugal, &quot;frango de churrasco&quot; with &quot;piri piri&quot; (a kind of salty roasted chicken cooked on the &quot;churrasqueira&quot;, spiced with hot red chili sauce, garlic, and paprika) is very popular. Portuguese &quot;churrasco&quot; and chicken dishes are very popular in countries with Portuguese communities, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South Africa, Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) and Venezuela. The term &quot;churrasco&quot; is also used in former Portuguese colonies; a &quot;churrasco moçambicano&quot; is a grilled meat dish from Mozambique, for instance.

In Galicia, &quot;churrasco&quot; refers almost exclusively to grilled pork or beef spare ribs. Galicians who emigrated to America in the 20th century took with them the recipe for &quot;churrasco&quot;. Nowadays, many Galicians of all social classes prepare a &quot;churrascada&quot;.

In the mainland United States, &quot;churrasco&quot;-style restaurants have grown in popularity since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonon, 10/15/2019&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; fueled by the success of various chains, including Rodizio Grill, Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chão, and Tucanos, as well as stand-alone Brazilian barbecue restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonon, 10/6/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mainland United States, &quot;Churrasco&quot; is a registered trademark for rotisserie/grills manufactured by Hickory Industries, Inc. of Fort Lee, New Jersey.

<doc id="849703" wikidata="Q1545386" url="?curid=849703" title="Gregory Mcdonald">
<text>Gregory Mcdonald (February 15, 1937 – September 7, 2008) was an American writer best known for his mystery adventures featuring investigative reporter Irwin Maurice &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher.

Two of the Fletch books earned Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America: &quot;Fletch&quot; was named Best First Novel in 1975, and &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; won for Best Paperback Original in 1977. This is the only time a novel and its sequel won back-to-back Edgars. Mcdonald would go on to write seven more novels in the &quot;Fletch&quot; series, as well as spinoffs and other standalone novels. The original book became a 1985 movie of the same name starring Chevy Chase.

==Career==

Mcdonald was born in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts and attended Harvard. While working as a high school teacher, he wrote and published his first novel, &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1964), a dramatic story of a college student&#x27;s suicide. His credential as a published novelist helped him get a job as a journalist for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in the late 1960s. 

His first mystery novel, &quot;Fletch&quot;, published in 1974, introduced the titular character, an ex-Marine who becomes a wisecracking, womanizing California-based investigative reporter adept at undercover work. In the second Fletch novel, &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; (1976), Mcdonald introduced his second signature protagonist, Inspector Francis Xavier Flynn, a brilliant but eccentric Boston Police homicide detective, who would go on to appear in four of his own spin-off novels. The Fletch series also spawned the &quot;Son of Fletch&quot; series, in which Mcdonald introduced the character of Jack Faoni, the illegitimate son of Irwin Maurice Fletcher. In addition, Mcdonald wrote two mysteries set in Tennessee in the &quot;Skylar&quot; series and a number of non-series (and non-mystery) novels.

Most of Mcdonald&#x27;s mysteries mixed doses of humor and satire alongside the adventure and whodunit plots. Three of the later Fletch novels, &quot;Fletch and the Widow Bradley&quot;, &quot;Fletch Won&quot; and &quot;Fletch Too&quot; were prequels set in a period in which Fletch was still a struggling young journalist, rather than the wealthy adventurer/troubleshooter he became after the events of &quot;Fletch&quot;.

==Adaptations==

A 1972 British film co-written and directed by David Hemmings was adapted from Mcdonald&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Running Scared&quot;.

In 1985, the first novel in the Fletch series was adapted into a movie with Chevy Chase playing the irreverent investigative reporter. Although Mcdonald had never seen Chevy Chase perform in anything substantial, he readily agreed to the casting of the actor in the role, and had nothing but praise for his performance. Chase would reprise his role in the 1989 sequel &quot;Fletch Lives&quot; (based on the Fletch character, but not adapted from any Mcdonald novel). There were no further Fletch films until the series was rebooted years after Mcdonald&#x27;s death with &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; (2022) starring Jon Hamm. 

His 1991 neo-western novel &quot;The Brave&quot; was adapted into an unsuccessful 1997 film directed by and starring Johnny Depp.

==Personal life==
In the mid-1980s, he moved to Pulaski, Tennessee, where he bought an antebellum farm and became involved in local politics, specifically anti-Klan work. (Pulaski was the birthplace of the KKK.) 

He died at his home from prostate cancer in 2008. Aside from his wife, Cheryle Higgins, whom he married in 2001, Mcdonald was survived by a sister, two children, three stepsons and grandchildren. His first marriage ended in divorce.

<text>Marc Evans (born 1960) is a Welsh director of film and television, whose credits include the films &quot;House of America&quot;, &quot;Resurrection Man&quot; and &quot;My Little Eye&quot;.

==Biography==
Evans was born in 1960 in Cardiff, Wales. He studied for a history of art degree at the University of Cambridge, and then took a year out before taking a one-year course in film at the University of Bristol, where one of his contemporaries was Michael Winterbottom.

===Career===
Evans worked as a runner for a commercials company in London, before beginning directing on TV dramas, starting out with Welsh-medium productions for S4C, and worked on episodes of &quot;The Ruth Rendell Mysteries&quot;.

He then switched to film, with &quot;House of America&quot; (1997) about a young immigrant coming from Wales to the United States, who falls foul of the American dream. In 1998 controversy started over his &quot;Resurrection Man&quot;, an extreme horror period drama set amid sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.

The later films of Marc Evans show a shift from an exploration of the relationships between national identity and myth, to an innovative reworking of the horror genre in the critically acclaimed &quot;My Little Eye&quot;, which tapped into the Zeitgeist via its embedded critique of the extremities of reality television and the internet. His first box office hit was the &quot;Big Brother&quot;-inspired horror film &quot;My Little Eye&quot;. In 2004 he directed &quot;Trauma&quot; starring Colin Firth, Mena Suvari and Brenda Fricker; script written by Richard Smith, which reprised the darker elements of &quot;My Little Eye&quot; via a chilling psychological study of amnesia and despair.

In 2006, he directed the Canadian feature film &quot;Snow Cake&quot;, starring Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman. His documentary &quot;In Prison My Whole Life&quot;, about death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal, premiered at the 2007 London Film Festival and was selected for the Sundance Film Festival in 2008.

Evans, in an interview at Cineworld Cinema in Cardiff, declared that he is working on a musical set in Swansea of the year 1976, with Catherine Zeta-Jones attached, which then changed to become Minnie Driver. The film, &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, premiered at the 55th BFI London Film Festival and was released on 2 March 2012, in the UK and Ireland. The film also stars Kimberley Nixon and Aneurin Barnard, the West End Actor of Spring Awakening .

He appeared in &quot;A Life in the Death of Joe Meek&quot;, an independent documentary about the British record producer Joe Meek, which he was initially slated to direct.

Also in 2012, Marc Evans directed the ITV produced &quot;Doors Open&quot;, a television adaptation of a book by the crime novelist Ian Rankin. The film tells the story of a self-made millionaire, an art professor and a banker, who come together to undertake an audacious art heist. The TV movie is starring Douglas Henshall and Stephen Fry.

Evans also directed the upcoming documentary feature titled &quot;Jack to a King – The Swansea Story&quot;, about the rise of Swansea City Football Club to the Premier League for the past decade. It is produced by YJB Films and was released on 12 September 2014. During the documentary production, Evans admitted that, “The thing that appealed to me the most was that it was something totally outside my experience and a story I’d not heard before. It was a film without any adult supervision – it was there for the taking as no one said how it had to be made. We were free to make the kind of film we felt we could make.”

Evans directed &quot;Cassy and Jude&quot;, a romantic comedy film based on the novel &quot;Cassandra at the Wedding&quot; by Dorothy Baker. The film is produced by Sam Taylor and Mike Downey of Film &amp; Music Entertainment Ltd, and is executive produced by Stephen Daldry.

It is rumoured, that Marc Evans will direct another musical film, entitled &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wigan&quot;, about the northern soul scene in Wigan Casino set in the 1970s. However, he is said to direct the Israeli-Palestinian comedy &quot;Birthright&quot;, produced by New York-based BoomGen Studios. The film tells the story of a shy Jewish-American boy, who follows the girl of his dreams on a trip to Israel, only to wind up lost in Palestine. The script for this movie was written by Ari Issler and Ben Snyder, after they had been on a trip to Israel.

Evans is a visiting professor at the University of Glamorgan&#x27;s creative arts school ATRiuM.

===Personal life===
Marc Evans is married to actress Nia Roberts; the couple lives in Cardiff, and have a daughter, Edith.

<doc id="849709" wikidata="Q7459801" url="?curid=849709" title="Sgùrr Choinnich">
<text>Sgùrr Choinnich is a mountain with a height of in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland. Classed as a Munro, it is in the Achnashellach Forest area between Glen Carron and Loch Monar. It has mostly steep, grassy slopes, with a narrow summit ridge that runs east–west. There are crags on the northern side of this ridge, looking down into the corrie of Coire Choinnich.

From the summit there are fine views of the Coulin and Torridon peaks to the north, whilst southward lies a large expanse of wilderness around Loch Monar.

The hill is often climbed along with the neighbouring Sgùrr a&#x27; Chaorachain, to the east, as the pair are linked by a high bealach at the head of Coire Choinnich. The most normal route of ascent starts from the north, near Craig, a small village in Glen Carron. A good track leads up the side of the Allt a&#x27; Chonais burn, and once across the burn one possible route of ascent is the north ridge of Sgùrr a&#x27; Chaorachain. From the summit of this peak one may continue west onto the summit of Sgùrr Choinnich. From the east, a well defined ridge leads to the bealach of Bealach Bhearnais; here a stalkers track leads from the glen of Allt a&#x27; Chonais is met, thus a circular route is possible. Alternatively from Bealach Bhearnais one may choose to ascend the neighbouring peaks of Beinn Tharsuinn and Sgùrr nan Feartaig.

<text>Courvoisier () is a brand of cognac, with production based in the town of Jarnac in the Charente region of France. It is the youngest and smallest of the &quot;big four&quot; cognac houses (the others are Hennessy, Rémy Martin, and Martell).

Courvoisier has also been described as the most untypical of the big four. It controls every step of its production process but does no distilling of its own, changes the process for different vintages and regional variations in &quot;eaux-de-vie&quot;, and has never owned vines. In 2019, it exported approximately 1.4 million nine-litre cases of its cognacs.

The brand has been owned by several companies in recent years from Allied Domecq in the 1990s, Beam Global (later Suntory Global Spirits) thereafter, and most recently Campari Group since May 2024.

== History ==

In 1835, Emmanuel Courvoisier started a wine and spirit company in the Parisian suburb of Bercy with Louis Gallois, then the mayor of Bercy. Originally, the pair would act as traders for the best cognacs of the region. Eventually they decided that the only way they could guarantee the very finest cognac was relocate to the region and become producers themselves. The 200-year-old crafting process has not changed since Courvoisier&#x27;s establishment in Bercy.

Emperor of the French Napoleon Bonaparte visited Bercy in 1811 as documented in a historic painting by Etienne Bouhot, and later was credited with saying he wanted his artillery companies to have a ration of cognac during the Napoleonic Wars. Legend has it that Napoleon I later took several barrels of cognac with him to St Helena, a treat much appreciated by the English officers on the ship, who named it &quot;the Cognac of Napoleon&quot;. In 1869, Napoleon&#x27;s heir Napoleon III personally requested Courvoisier and bestowed the honourable title of &quot;Official Supplier to the Imperial Court&quot; which is still displayed at the Courvoisier museum in Jarnac.

In 1828, Felix Courvoisier and Jules Gallois, the sons of Emmanuel and Louis, wanted to improve the quality of cognac, moving the company to the heart of the Cognac region in the town of Jarnac. After Felix&#x27;s passing in 1866, his nephews, the Curlier brothers, took over the management of the business. By 1909, the business was sold to the Simon family from England, but still maintained its production and headquarters in the Jarnac region.

Located ten minutes from the town of Cognac, the main Courvoisier business operations still operate from the Château on the banks of the Charente river which was established in the 1870s. Courvoisier sources eaux-de-vie from the following crus to create its blends: Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies and Fin Bois. The harvest season begins in October, followed up by distillation from November to March. Courvoisier cognac is aged in barrels handmade from 200-year-old oak sourced from the Tronçais forest in France.

Courvoisier headquarters are still stationed in Jarnac, about ten minutes from the Cognac region. Courvoisier is run from the original Château Felix Courvoisier and Jules Gallois moved to in 1828. Today, the Courvoisier Château has a boutique and museum, offering private tastings and exclusive tours. The museum features several items linked to Napoleon I.

In December 2023, Campari Group made an agreement to acquire the company that owned the brand. On 1 May 2024, it was announced that this transaction had been completed.

== Marketing ==
Courvoisier launched the Joséphine bottle in 1951, named after Napoleon&#x27;s first wife. The shape of the bottle, with a thin neck and wide base, has become synonymous with Courvoisier, and speculation still exists whether the shape is meant to mimic Josephine&#x27;s love of corsets or an inverted replica of early brandy glasses.

Courvoisier was the first cognac brand to appear on TV with an advertisement on UK television broadcast to nine million viewers. In 2009, Courvoisier was the first alcohol brand to release a 3D advertisement, titled &quot;Cognac With Another Dimension&quot;, on TV and in cinemas, ahead of the viewing of the biggest-grossing film of all time, &quot;Avatar&quot;. A special iPod app was created to teach consumers how to use Courvoisier as an ingredient in cocktails as part of the &quot;Mixability&quot; promotion.

In 2009 Courvoisier created an &quot;Architectural Punchbowl&quot; in conjunction with Bompas &amp; Parr. It was intended as immersive brand experience, featuring cocktails served from a structure filled with 4,000 litres of a punch containing Courvoisier. The event was a homage to Admiral Edward Russell, who in 1694 created a large punchbowl that had to be served by a boy rowing across it.

In 1988, famed Art Deco designer Erté was commissioned to create limited edition Courvoisier bottles containing Grande Champagne cognac dating back to the year of his birth, 1892. The seven unique designs represented various stages of the cognac distillation process interpreted by Erté&#x27;s unique designs.

Courvoisier&#x27;s next fashion partnership was in 2005 with English designer Vivienne Westwood. Sold exclusively at Harvey Nichols, The Courvoisier XO dressed by Vivienne Westwood only released 150 limited edition bottles.

The oldest bottle of Courvoisier, with liquid dating back to 1789, was unveiled at Harrod&#x27;s for the Alchimie L&#x27;Atelier event. Discovered in Dutch collector Bay van der Bunt&#x27;s vault, the bottle went on sale for €90,000.

<text>Joaquín Fernando &quot;Jackie&quot; Gutiérrez (born June 27, 1960) is a Colombian former professional baseball 
shortstop. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Philadelphia Phillies, and was the first Colombian MLB player to play for these teams. Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed.

==Biography==
Gutiérrez began his professional baseball career in 1978 with the Elmira Pioneers, a farm team of the Boston Red Sox. He reached the Triple-A level in 1983.

Gutiérrez reached the major leagues with Boston in 1983, playing in parts of three seasons with the Red Sox, including a career-high 151 games in 1984. The third native Colombian to play in MLB, he was the Red Sox&#x27;s starting shortstop in 1984 and into the first two months of the following campaign. A knee injury sustained in a 10–3 loss to the Texas Rangers at Arlington Stadium on May 25, 1985 led to him being supplanted by Glenn Hoffman and unable to reclaim the position as he ended 1985 with 23 errors and a .218 batting average that was 45 points lower than from the previous year.

He was traded from the Red Sox to the Orioles for Sammy Stewart on December 17, 1985. Upon hearing reports that Gutiérrez was released by two winter ball teams in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela because of erratic behavior which involved frequent fights, the Orioles attempted to have the transaction restructured or voided, alleging that the Red Sox had prior knowledge of any such issues. American League president Bobby Brown upheld the deal on March 11, 1986, ruling that it was made in &quot;good faith, with neither club knowingly misrepresenting the facts&quot; and that &quot;the Orioles&#x27; request to rescind the trade has been denied.&quot;

Entering the 1986 season, the Orioles&#x27; expectations for Gutiérrez was for him to become the starting third baseman, allowing Floyd Rayford to replace Rick Dempsey as catcher. Gutiérrez&#x27;s fWAR of -1.7 was the lowest among all MLB players in the 1986 season.

Gutiérrez last played in MLB with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1988.

In parts of six major league seasons, Gutiérrez batted .237 with four home runs, 63 RBI, 106 runs, 24 doubles, five triples and 25 stolen bases in 356 games.

Gutiérrez continued his minor league career through 1990, last playing with the unaffiliated Miami Miracle. His final season playing professionally was 1993, when he played for the China Times Eagles in the Chinese Professional Baseball League.

During his time with the Boston Red Sox he was known as &quot;The Whistler&quot; for his constant whistling between pitches which could be heard all around every ballpark.

Gutiérrez&#x27;s father, Elias Gutiérrez, represented Colombia at the 1936 Summer Olympics as a sprinter and javelin thrower.

<doc id="849724" wikidata="Q852486" url="?curid=849724" title="Rapa Nui people">
<text>The Rapa Nui (Rapa Nui: , Spanish: ) are the indigenous Polynesian peoples of Easter Island. The easternmost Polynesian culture, the descendants of the original people of Easter Island make up about 60% of the current Easter Island population and have a significant portion of their population residing in mainland Chile. They speak both the traditional Rapa Nui language and the primary language of Chile, Spanish. At the 2017 census there were 7,750 island inhabitants—almost all living in the village of Hanga Roa on the sheltered west coast.

As of 2011, Rapa Nui&#x27;s main source of income derived from tourism, which focuses on the giant sculptures called moai.

Over the past decade, Rapa Nui activists have been fighting for self-determination and sovereignty over their lands. Protests in 2010 and 2011 by the indigenous Rapa Nui on Easter Island, objecting to the creation of a marine park and reserve, have led to clashes with Chilean police.

==History==
===Pre-European contact (300–1722 CE)===
Rapa Nui are believed to have settled Easter Island between 300 and 1200 CE. Previously, the date of arrival was estimated to be around 700–800 CE, but more-recent evidence from radiocarbon dating supports an arrival date as late as 1200 CE. The Rapa Nui People have been found to be of Polynesian origin through genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA of pre-historic skeletons. Genetic analysis performed by Erik Thorsby and other geneticists in 2007 revealed genetic markers of European and Amerindian origin that suggest that the Rapa Nui had European and Amerindian contributions to their DNA during or before the early 1800s.

===Early European contact (1722–1870 CE)===
Jacob Roggeveen was the first European to record contact with the Rapa Nui. Roggeveen allegedly set sail either in search of Juan Fernández Islands or David&#x27;s Island but instead arrived at Easter Island on April 5, 1722 (Easter Sunday). He remained on the island for about a week. Felipe González de Ahedo visited the Rapa Nui in 1770 and claimed the island for Spain on a document which the islanders wrote on in rongorongo, the now undecipherable Rapa Nui script. James Cook and Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, visited the island for a few days in 1774 and 1786, respectively.

==Culture==

=== Language ===

The Rapa Nui currently speak Spanish and the traditional Rapa Nui language. The Rapa Nui language, also known as Pascuan, is classified as an Eastern Polynesian language and is currently written in the Latin script. Rapa Nui is a minority language, as most Rapa Nui people speak Spanish as their first language. Spanish is the most widely spoken language on Easter Island and the primary language of education and administration. It is believed that Rapa Nui is currently undergoing a shift toward more Spanish sentence structure. Rongorongo, a system of glyphs discovered in the 1800s, is believed to represent an older version of the Rapa Nui language. However, the decipherment of rongorongo is an ongoing process and it is not yet clear whether Rongorongo is a form of writing or some other form of cultural expression.

=== Mythology ===

The main stories of Rapa Nui mythology are that of Hotu Matu&#x27;a, believed to be the first settler of Easter Island, and the Tangata manu. The Tangata manu is the mythology of the Birdman religion and cult which had creator god Makemake and competition with eggs to choose the birdman who would remain sacred for five months. More recent Rapa Nui mythology includes the story of the epic battle between the Hanau Epe and the Hanau Momoko.

The trans-Neptunian dwarf planet Makemake is named after this creator deity.

===Moai===

The best-known aspect of the Rapa Nui culture is the &quot;moai&quot;, the 887 human figures carved from rock between 1250 and 1500 CE and transported throughout Easter Island. The moai were believed to be the living faces of ancestors and had all been toppled by 1868. The moai rest on large stone platforms called &quot;ahu&quot;, the most famous of which are Ahu Tongariki, the largest ahu, and Ahu Vinapu. Some moai have hats of red volcanic stone known as &quot;Pukao&quot;. Currently, the Rapa Nui and the Chilean government are focused on preserving and restoring the statues. Rapa Nui National Park, which includes many of the statues, is a World Heritage site.

===Art===
The Rapa Nui have historically made feather headdresses, bark cloth, wood carvings, and stone carvings. Adzes, blunt round stones, were used to complete stone images and wood carvings. A distinguishing characteristic of Rapa Nui statues is the use of shell or coral inlaid with obsidian to represent eyes.

===Music===

Rapa Nui traditional music consists of choral singing and chanting accompanied by instruments including conch shell trumpets, percussive dancers, accordions, and kauaha, a percussion instrument created from the jaw bone of a horse. Modern Rapanui music has had Latin American influences creating new genres such as the Rapa Nui style of tango. Matato&#x27;a, one of the most famous musical groups on the island, promotes traditional styles of dance and music.

=== Tattoos ===

Like in other Polynesian islands, tattoos and body paintings had a fundamentally spiritual connotation. In some cases the tattoos were considered a receptor for divine strength or mana. They were manifestations of the Rapa Nui culture. Priests, warriors and chiefs had more tattoos than the rest of the population, as a symbol of their hierarchy. Both men and women were tattooed to represent their social class. Tattoos, as well as other forms of art in Rapa Nui, blends anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. Nowadays, young people are bringing back Rapa Nui tattoos as an important part of their culture and local artists base their creations on traditional motifs.

The tattooing process was performed with bone needles and combs called Uhi made out of bird or fish bones. The ink was made out of natural products, primarily from the burning of Ti leaves (&quot;Cordyline terminalis&quot;) and sugar cane.

=== Cuisine ===
Pascuense cuisine, otherwise known as Easter Island cuisine or Rapa Nui cuisine incorporates the influences of the indigenous Rapa Nui people and Latin America. Notable ingredients include seafood such as fish, octopus (heke), eel, sea snails (pipi) and crustaceans (lobster), as well as sweet potato, taro, banana, pineapple, coconut, pumpkin, and poultry, pork and lamb meat.[1]
Traditional foods include umu, meat, fish, vegetables and fruit wrapped in banana leaves and roasted in umu pae – an earth oven. Po&#x27;e, pudding made of mashed bananas, pumpkin and flour is baked in the umu pae as well.[1] Other favorite dishes are tunu ahi, fish grilled on hot stones, or ceviche. Pascuense cuisine also includes meat dishes, such as pork or mutton ribs.[2]

==Interaction with the environment==
A common hypothesis is held that the apparent decline of Rapa Nui culture and society before European arrival in 1722 was caused by the over-exploitation of the island&#x27;s environment, most notably through deforestation of almost all the island&#x27;s trees. The most prominent proponent of this explanation is Jared Diamond who proposes a scenario for the &quot;ecocide&quot; on Easter Island in his 2005 book &quot;Collapse&quot;.

This idea that Rapa Nui society collapsed came out of the imbalance between general resources present on the island, mainly population, timber and food sources, and the energy- and resource-intensive feat of transporting and raising the moai. Food resources may have been scarcer than in other areas of Polynesia because of factors like the cooler climate, lack of rainfall in comparison to other islands in the area, high winds and a lack of biodiversity, leading to common Polynesian crops not faring as well as they would in other areas of the Pacific. A source of good timber is also currently noticeably absent from the island, the tallest extant plant life averaging around 7 feet.

Although Easter Island currently has only 48 different kinds of plants as evidenced by botanical surveys of the island, it once possessed many more, shown through pollen analysis conducted on sediment layers from swamps or ponds. From these samples, 22 no longer present on the island were shown to have existed at some time there. These plants included a giant palm, the Rapa Nui Palm, that showed signs of being the largest palm species in the world, eclipsing the size of the Chilean Wine Palm if it were not extinct. There are also signs of Easter Island&#x27;s once possessing a far more diverse collection of fauna. The skeletal remains of 25 different species of nesting bird have been located on the island, but have since been reduced to 16. This trend of extinction and extirpation is a common occurrence when humans populate a new area, because of tendencies to overhunt and overexploit resources.

Deforestation would have caused a decrease in crop yields due to soil erosion, loss of wood as a resource to construct fishing boats, among other things, and would have necessitated a halt to the construction of the moai erected around the island. Diamond hypothesizes that resource scarcity may have led to brutal civil war, creating a drop in population. He further hypothesizes that there were about 7,000 individuals pre-war, a number which fell to the 2,000 whom missionaries met when they showed up in the 19th century and conducted the first census of the island.

In recent years, this decline has been increasingly implicated not upon environmental destruction caused by the Rapa Nui people but instead upon the arrival of Europeans to the island and the diseases that commonly came with them like smallpox, with several researchers having instead noted that pre-colonial Rapa Nui society was rather stable.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture on Easter Island shows signs of intensification before European arrival, necessary because of its climate which had an excess of wind and a low amount of rainfall for the area. Archaeological finds show a multitude of composting pits and irrigation systems. Large boulders were also stacked to serve as barriers against the wind. In the fields, a system of agriculture called mulch was employed. In this method, farmers would lay rocks out in patterns in their fields, forcing the plants to grow in certain areas. This method is known to increase soil moisture while decreasing soil erosion from wind, effectively combating the climate conditions.

Crops grown on Easter Island included sweet potatoes, yams, taro, bananas and sugarcane. Chickens were the sole domestic animal, though the &quot;chicken coops&quot; carved of stone which still dot the fields of the island were most likely tombs from which the chickens obtained calcium and phosphorus in the form of bone meal.

<doc id="849738" wikidata="Q5421988" url="?curid=849738" title="Exterior covariant derivative">
<text>In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the exterior covariant derivative is an extension of the notion of exterior derivative to the setting of a differentiable principal bundle or vector bundle with a connection.

==Definition==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a Lie group and be a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle on a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;. Suppose there is a connection on &quot;P&quot;; this yields a natural direct sum decomposition formula_1 of each tangent space into the horizontal and vertical subspaces. Let formula_2 be the projection to the horizontal subspace.

If &quot;ϕ&quot; is a &quot;k&quot;-form on &quot;P&quot; with values in a vector space &quot;V&quot;, then its exterior covariant derivative &quot;Dϕ&quot; is a form defined by
:formula_3
where &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; are tangent vectors to &quot;P&quot; at &quot;u&quot;.

Suppose that is a representation of &quot;G&quot; on a vector space &quot;V&quot;. If &quot;ϕ&quot; is equivariant in the sense that

:formula_4

where formula_5, then &quot;Dϕ&quot; is a tensorial -form on &quot;P&quot; of the type &quot;ρ&quot;: it is equivariant and horizontal (a form &quot;ψ&quot; is horizontal if .)

By abuse of notation, the differential of &quot;ρ&quot; at the identity element may again be denoted by &quot;ρ&quot;:

:formula_6

Let formula_7 be the connection one-form and formula_8 the representation of the connection in formula_9 That is, formula_8 is a formula_11-valued form, vanishing on the horizontal subspace. If &quot;ϕ&quot; is a tensorial &quot;k&quot;-form of type &quot;ρ&quot;, then
:formula_12

where, following the notation in &quot;&quot;, we wrote

:formula_13
Unlike the usual exterior derivative, which squares to 0, the exterior covariant derivative does not. In general, one has, for a tensorial zero-form &quot;ϕ&quot;,

:formula_14

where is the representation in formula_11 of the curvature two-form Ω. The form F is sometimes referred to as the field strength tensor, in analogy to the role it plays in electromagnetism. Note that &quot;D&quot;2 vanishes for a flat connection (i.e. when ).

If , then one can write
:formula_16
where formula_17 is the matrix with 1 at the -th entry and zero on the other entries. The matrix formula_18 whose entries are 2-forms on &quot;P&quot; is called the curvature matrix.

== For vector bundles ==
Given a smooth real vector bundle with a connection and rank , the exterior covariant derivative is a real-linear map on the vector-valued differential forms that are valued in :
:formula_19
The covariant derivative is such a map for . The exterior covariant derivatives extends this map to general . There are several equivalent ways to define this object:
* Suppose that a vector-valued differential 2-form is regarded as assigning to each a multilinear map which is completely anti-symmetric. Then the exterior covariant derivative assigns to each a multilinear map given by the formula
::formula_20
:where are arbitrary tangent vectors at which are extended to smooth locally-defined vector fields . The legitimacy of this definition depends on the fact that the above expression depends only on , and not on the choice of extension. This can be verified by the Leibniz rule for covariant differentiation and for the Lie bracket of vector fields. The pattern established in the above formula in the case can be directly extended to define the exterior covariant derivative for arbitrary .
* The exterior covariant derivative may be characterized by the axiomatic property of defining for each a real-linear map which for is the covariant derivative and in general satisfies the Leibniz rule
::formula_21
:for any differential -form and any vector-valued form . This may also be viewed as a direct inductive definition. For instance, for any vector-valued differential 1-form and any local frame of the vector bundle, the coordinates of are locally-defined differential 1-forms . The above inductive formula then says that
::formula_22
:In order for this to be a legitimate definition of , it must be verified that the choice of local frame is irrelevant. This can be checked by considering a second local frame obtained by an arbitrary change-of-basis matrix; the inverse matrix provides the change-of-basis matrix for the 1-forms . When substituted into the above formula, the Leibniz rule as applied for the standard exterior derivative and for the covariant derivative cancel out the arbitrary choice.
* A vector-valued differential 2-form may be regarded as a certain collection of functions assigned to an arbitrary local frame of over a local coordinate chart of . The exterior covariant derivative is then defined as being given by the functions
::formula_23
:The fact that this defines a tensor field valued in is a direct consequence of the same fact for the covariant derivative. The further fact that it is a differential 3-form valued in asserts the full anti-symmetry in and is directly verified from the above formula and the contextual assumption that is a vector-valued differential 2-form, so that . The pattern in this definition of the exterior covariant derivative for can be directly extended to larger values of .This definition may alternatively be expressed in terms of an arbitrary local frame of but without considering coordinates on . Then a vector-valued differential 2-form is expressed by differential 2-forms and the connection is expressed by the connection 1-forms, a skew-symmetric matrix of differential 1-forms . The exterior covariant derivative of , as a vector-valued differential 3-form, is expressed relative to the local frame by many differential 3-forms, defined by
::formula_24

In the case of the trivial real line bundle with its standard connection, vector-valued differential forms and differential forms can be naturally identified with one another, and each of the above definitions coincides with the standard exterior derivative.

Given a principal bundle, any linear representation of the structure group defines an associated bundle, and any connection on the principal bundle induces a connection on the associated vector bundle. Differential forms valued in the vector bundle may be naturally identified with fully anti-symmetric tensorial forms on the total space of the principal bundle. Under this identification, the notions of exterior covariant derivative for the principal bundle and for the vector bundle coincide with one another.

The curvature of a connection on a vector bundle may be defined as the composition of the two exterior covariant derivatives and , so that it is defined as a real-linear map . It is a fundamental but not immediately apparent fact that only depends on , and does so linearly. As such, the curvature may be regarded as an element of . Depending on how the exterior covariant derivative is formulated, various alternative but equivalent definitions of curvature (some without the language of exterior differentiation) can be obtained.

It is a well-known fact that the composition of the standard exterior derivative with itself is zero: . In the present context, this can be regarded as saying that the standard connection on the trivial line bundle has zero curvature.

== Example ==
* Bianchi&#x27;s second identity, which says that the exterior covariant derivative of Ω is zero (that is, ) can be stated as: formula_25.

<text>Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church (, October 1520) was the second of the three major treatises published by Martin Luther in 1520, coming after the &quot;Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot; (August 1520) and before &quot;On the Freedom of a Christian&quot; (November 1520). The book-length work was theological, and as such was published in Latin as well as German, the language in which the treatises were written.

== Context ==
The book was circulating in print not quite a week when the papal bull against Luther arrived in Wittenberg in October 1520. The bull and the book were being prepared simultaneously.

Luther accuses the Catholic Church and the papacy of keeping the church in captivity, equating Rome with the biblical Babylon that exiled the Israelites from their homeland, holding them captive in Babylon. According to Luther, the pope was holding the church in captivity through the use of the sacramental system and Catholic theology.

In 1521, Luther was requested to either confess or recant his books, including his treatise &quot;The Babylonian Captivity of the Church.&quot; It still defines the Confessional Lutheran relationship to the number of sacraments.

==Content==
In this work Luther examines the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church in the light of his interpretation of the Bible. With regard to the Eucharist, he advocates restoring the cup to the laity, dismisses the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation but affirms the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist, and rejects the teaching that the Mass is a sacrifice offered to God.

With regard to baptism, he writes that it brings justification only if conjoined with saving faith in the recipient; however, it remains the foundation of salvation even for those who might later fall and be reclaimed.

As for penance, its essence consists in the words of promise (absolution) received by faith. Only these three can be regarded as sacraments because of their divine institution and the divine promises of salvation connected with them; but strictly speaking, only Baptism and the Eucharist are sacraments, since only they have &quot;divinely instituted visible sign[s]&quot;: water in Baptism and bread and wine in the Eucharist. Luther claimed that Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, and Extreme Unction are not sacraments.

Luther wrote that marriage was not a sacrament because God the Father gave marriage to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and Jesus did not give humans the ability to marry. He also defended the marriages of Muslims and Jews, and thought they were valid under God just as much as Christian marriages.

The titular &quot;captivity&quot; is firstly the withholding the cup in the Lord&#x27;s Supper from the laity, the second the doctrine of transubstantiation, and the third, the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching that the Mass &quot;was&quot; a sacrifice and a good work.

The work is angry in tone, attacking the papacy, and at some points, even defending some practices of Muslims and Jews. Although Luther had made a link tentatively in the address &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot;, this was the first time he forthrightly accused the pope of being the Antichrist. For the clerical audience whose offices were justified by the performance of sacraments, Luther&#x27;s reassessment of the whole sacramental system made &quot;The Babylonian Captivity&quot; one of his most controversial works.

Although published in Latin, a translation of this work was quickly published in German by Luther’s opponent, the Strasbourg Franciscan Thomas Murner. He hoped that by making people aware of the radical nature of Luther’s beliefs, they would realise their foolishness in supporting him. In fact, the opposite proved true, and Murner’s translation helped to spread Luther’s views across Germany. The virulence of Luther&#x27;s language however, was off-putting to some. After the publication of this work, with its harsh condemnation of the papacy, the renowned humanist Erasmus, who had previously been cautiously supportive of Luther&#x27;s activities, became convinced that he should not support Luther&#x27;s calls for reform.
