==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
====Golden Age====
Professor Hugo Strange first appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #36 (February 1940) as a scientist and criminal mastermind who uses a stolen &quot;concentrated lightning&quot; machine to generate a dense fog every night so his gang can rob banks unseen, though he knows that Batman poses a threat to him. Batman, who already knows of Strange&#x27;s experiments, begins investigating him after one of his henchmen commits a murder. When the robbers are apprehended, Strange vows to set a trap for Batman and deal with him personally. He has a dozen of his men ambush the vigilante, and one of them knocks him out with a blackjack. Batman wakes up in Strange&#x27;s lair, where Strange hangs him from his wrists and lashes him with a whip. Batman breaks the ropes, gasses the room, and defeats Strange, who is jailed but quickly begins planning his escape.

In &quot;Batman&quot; #1 (spring 1940), Strange carries out his escape plan, recruits a new gang of criminals, then breaks out five patients from Arkham Asylum and uses them as test subjects, turning them into monsters using an artificial growth hormone. He outfits them with bulletproof clothing, and uses them to rampage through Gotham City and distract the police while his men commit robberies. Strange administers the serum to Batman after the giants capture him, saying it will work in 18 hours. Batman tricks two of the monsters into killing each other, and then formulates a drug that prevents any abnormal secretions from the pituitary gland, preventing the transformation. He is then able to kill all the other monsters, and sends Strange to his apparent death in a fall from a cliff, although he suspects that the mad scientist has survived.

In &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #46 (December 1940), Strange returns and starts spreading a fear-inducing powder around the city until a punch from Batman again sends him falling off a cliff to his apparent death.

====Earth-One====
He returned years later in the 1970s in the &quot;Strange Apparitions&quot; story arc in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #469-479 (May 1977-September–October 1978). Having survived his earlier &quot;death&quot;, Strange left Gotham City and went to Europe for several years, where his criminal career prospered with no one to challenge him. Bored and hoping to pit his wits against Batman again, Strange, now using the alias of Dr. Todhunter, opens a private hospital, Graytowers Clinic, for Gotham&#x27;s wealthiest citizens, where he holds them for ransom before mutating them into mindless monsters. When Bruce Wayne checks into the hospital to recover discreetly from radiation burns he sustained while fighting Doctor Phosphorus, Strange finds out that Wayne is Batman and uses this information to wreak havoc on his personal life. Strange then attempts to auction the identity of Batman to Rupert Thorne, Penguin, and Joker. Not wanting to lose, Thorne has Strange abducted and beaten by his men to reveal Batman&#x27;s identity, but Strange apparently dies without ever telling him. Strange&#x27;s ghost returns to haunt Thorne, driving him insane. Thorne confesses his corruption and is sent to Arkham Asylum.

Strange&#x27;s ghost returns again to haunt Thorne in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #513 (April 1982), #516 (July 1982), #518 (September 1982), and #520 (November 1982) and &quot;Batman&quot; #354 (December 1982), leading up to the appearance of the &quot;real&quot; Hugo Strange in the last panel of the last page of the fifth issue mentioned here. As revealed two issues later in &quot;Batman&quot; #356 (February 1983), Strange had indeed survived the beating from Thorne&#x27;s men by using yoga techniques to slow his heartbeat to an undetectable level. It is also revealed that Strange also artificially created the &quot;ghost&quot; of himself that haunted Thorne by using strategically-placed devices that simulated the appearance of a spirit. Upon his return, Strange used the devices again to bring back the &quot;ghost&quot; so he could punish Thorne for double-crossing him. Subsequently, Strange attempts to weaken Bruce Wayne through the use of drugs and lifelike robots called Mandroids, with the ultimate goal of destroying Wayne completely so that Strange could take his place as Batman. The plan fails, and Strange apparently dies once more when he attempts to kill Batman by blowing up a replica of Wayne Manor with himself in it, stating that if &quot;he&quot; cannot be Batman, then &quot;no&quot; one can. Batman survives the explosion, but no trace of Strange is found.

Later, Strange returns yet again (the Hugo Strange that &quot;died&quot; in the explosion was revealed by the real Strange to be a Mandroid) in &quot;Batman Annual&quot; #10 (1986), in another attempt to destroy Batman and Bruce Wayne, this time attempting to financially bankrupt Wayne by using various tricks to force three Wayne Enterprises shareholders to sell their stock holdings to him so he could bankrupt the company. He also attempts to frame Batman as a criminal. However, Strange is defeated and sent to prison. Batman is able to stop Strange from further exploiting his knowledge of his secret identity by falsely claiming that he hypnotized Strange to give him a fake idea of Batman&#x27;s true identity just before Commissioner Gordon shows up to arrest him; his explanation is so convincing that Strange begins to wonder if Batman is attempting a complex double-bluff by letting him think that Bruce Wayne is Batman and thus doubts whether his original conclusion was correct.

====Earth-Two====
The Earth-Two version of Strange has a similar early history to the Earth-One version and also survives the fall that he experienced in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #46. In &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #182 (January 1982), it is revealed that he is left paralyzed by the fall but, after years of physical therapy, he regains enough movement to write out the surgical techniques needed to repair the damage to his body - and bribes a surgeon to perform the operation. The surgeon lacks Strange&#x27;s skill, and the operation leaves Strange deformed. Strange uses one of his devices to capture Starman&#x27;s Cosmic Rod to use its power to attack everyone and everything that Batman holds dear. He generates a storm in Gotham to obtain the device, which creates a dimensional doorway to Earth-One, bringing that universe&#x27;s Batman over to Earth-Two, which allows him and Earth-Two&#x27;s Robin to join with Earth-Two&#x27;s Batwoman in defeating Strange. Strange realizes that he is, in fact, angry at his own wasted life and deformed body, so he uses the Cosmic Rod to commit suicide.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
In the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Strange was reintroduced in the &quot;&quot; storyline as an eccentric private psychiatrist enlisted to help a task force assigned to capture Batman by providing them with a psychological profile of the vigilante. While brilliant at his work, Strange is depicted as being equally unbalanced: he becomes so obsessed with the case, he starts wearing a replica Batman costume in private, convinced that he alone understands the darkness that drives Batman.

According to Commissioner Gordon, Strange was &quot;abandoned as a child, grew up in state homes. A bright kid, but he apparently had a hell of a temper. Nobody knows how he put himself through college and medical school.&quot; Strange was raised in an orphanage on the lower East Side of Gotham City, in a neighborhood known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Crucible&quot;. As an adult, he became a professor of psychiatry at Gotham State University, but had his tenure suspended after using his position to promote a series of increasingly bizarre genetic engineering theories. He is approached by an Indian man named Sanjay, who seeks Strange&#x27;s aid in curing his sick brother. Strange agrees to help, and Sanjay works loyally by his side from that point onward. Borrowing money from Sal Maroni, who is in the employ of Carmine Falcone, Strange sets up a private laboratory to test his theories. He then bribes a corrupt orderly to supply him with ideal test subjects: inmates from Arkham Asylum who have been institutionalized for so long that they will not be missed.

Strange&#x27;s experiments have literally monstrous results, with his test subjects turning into gigantic, mindless &quot;Monster Men&quot;, possessing superhuman strength and cannibalistic instincts. Strange uses the Monster Men to commit crimes so he can put together the money needed to pay back his Mafia connections. Batman becomes involved after discovering some of the gruesome remains of the Monster&#x27;s Men&#x27;s cannibalistic rampages. When Strange sets his creations free at an illegal poker game, helping himself to the victims&#x27; money after the slaughter, the Gotham Mafia begins to grow suspicious. Batman tracks Strange down, but is captured by Sanjay and thrown to the Monster Men as an intended meal. Batman not only holds off the creatures, but uses them as part of an inventive escape. Strange is enthralled by Batman, believing that he has found a genetically perfect man. He creates one final Monster Man using a drop of Batman&#x27;s blood, and while his creation still has many of the flaws of its &quot;brothers&quot;, it lacks most of the grotesque disfigurements that had plagued Strange&#x27;s earlier creations. Strange is subsequently forced to destroy his lab to evade capture. Soon after, he turns the Monster Men loose, including Sanjay&#x27;s brother (who had also been mutated as a result of Strange&#x27;s &quot;treatments&quot;), at Falcone&#x27;s private estate in a bid to wipe out the Mob&#x27;s leaders, erasing his debt and covering up their ties to his work. In the battle that follows, all of the Monster Men are killed, along with Sanjay, who abandons Strange and dies trying to avenge his brother. Strange escapes amid the chaos, and succeeds in eradicating all links between himself and his experiments. Confident that his criminal past is buried, he begins to appear on TV by reinventing himself as a &quot;psychological expert&quot; on Batman.

It is possible that the events of Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy&#x27;s &quot;Prey&quot; storyline take place at this point. Partly due to Strange&#x27;s appearances on TV claiming to understand Batman&#x27;s motives, Captain James Gordon is ordered to assemble a task force to apprehend the vigilante, with Strange assisting him as a consultant to deduce Batman&#x27;s secret identity. As the task force&#x27;s investigation progresses, Strange grows increasingly maniacal in his obsession with Batman, going so far as expressing a desire to become Batman and dressing up in a replica Batsuit. To that end, Strange attempts to kill the Caped Crusader. However, Strange repeatedly underestimates the level of physical conditioning that is needed to be Batman. Strange also diagnoses Batman with various mental illnesses, such as explaining Batman&#x27;s use of a costume as symptomatic of dissociative identity disorder, whereas Gordon more accurately explains the Batsuit&#x27;s intended purpose as scaring criminals. Strange eventually concludes that Bruce Wayne is most likely Batman, brainwashes the task force&#x27;s commander to impersonate Batman to turn the public against him and sends him to kidnap the Mayor&#x27;s daughter while dressed as the Dark Knight. Despite Strange&#x27;s attempt to psychologically &quot;break&quot; Batman by creating recordings and setting up mannequins of Thomas and Martha Wayne blaming Bruce for their deaths, using Wayne Manor to enhance his illusions, Bruce is able to collect himself and focus in the Batcave. The following day, he confronts Strange and tricks him into doubting his own hypothesis about Batman&#x27;s secret identity, claiming that his parents are alive and living in Paraguay. Strange is ultimately exposed and shot by the task force when he attempts to escape, before falling into a river and being presumed dead.

In Doug Moench&#x27;s &quot;Terror&quot; storyline, Strange mysteriously returns. He decides to work with another of Batman&#x27;s enemies, the Scarecrow, and use him as a tool to help him capture Batman, while simultaneously having fallen into a further delusional state, as he engages in a &quot;relationship&quot; with a female mannequin dressed in Batman&#x27;s cowl, reflecting his warped dual admiration and loathing of Batman. The Scarecrow turns on Strange when the professor&#x27;s therapy proves effective enough to turn the Scarecrow against his &quot;benefactor&quot;, tricking Strange into falling into the cellar of his mansion base where the twisted psychiatrist is impaled on a weather vane that the Scarecrow had left in the cellar earlier. The Scarecrow then uses Strange&#x27;s mansion as a trap for Batman, but his attempt to use Strange&#x27;s plan fails when he tries to use Crime Alley as the scene of a trap while ignorant of the reasons &quot;why&quot; that alley is so significant to Batman, with his &quot;trap&quot; merely consisting of luring Batman into the alley and decapitating a former classmate of Crane&#x27;s in front of the hero. With Catwoman&#x27;s help, Batman locates the Scarecrow&#x27;s hideout and catches the Scarecrow in the cellar with Strange&#x27;s body before the house is destroyed in a fire, but loses sight of Strange, with it being unclear whether Strange had actually survived the fall onto the weather vanehe claimed that he lured rats to himself by using his sweat so that he could eat themor if the Scarecrow and Batman were hallucinating from exposure to Crane&#x27;s fear gas, although Batman concludes that the subsequent explosion of the house has definitely killed Strange.

&quot;Dark Moon Rising: Batman and the Monster Men&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot; all take place during Batman&#x27;s early years. In the modern timeline, Strange returns in a four-part storyline called &quot;Transference&quot;. Initially appearing in his own Batsuit, he captures Catwoman with the aid of his henchwoman Doraa former patient whom he has subjected to extensive mental conditioning by Strange to act as a new &quot;Catwoman&quot;and attempts to interrogate her about Batman&#x27;s current status, Strange dismissing the existence of Batman&#x27;s new allies by proclaiming them to be &quot;parasites&quot;, as he cannot accept that Batman would share his &quot;power&quot; with anyone. He is then shown posing as a psychiatrist doing standard stress evaluations at Wayne Enterprises. While Bruce Wayne is on the couch, Strange drugs him with a powerful hallucinogen to coax Wayne into admitting that he is Batman. Wayne is able to escape by using cleaning fluid to start a fire, fakes Batman&#x27;s death by destroying the Batmobile with him supposedly in it, and triggers a post-hypnotic suggestion in himself, forcing him to completely repress the Batman aspect of his mind until Robin and Nightwing can defeat Strange. Faced with Nightwing and Robin each denying that Wayne is Batman and witnessing Wayne&#x27;s complete lack of combat reflexes and training, Strange becomes concerned that his theory that Bruce Wayne is Batman has been disproved and realizes that he will never be able to learn the truth now that he &quot;killed&quot; the Dark Knight. Faced with this conflicting situation, Strange has a mental breakdown and voluntarily turns himself in at Arkham Asylum.

Strange next reappears as the head of a gang of supervillains attempting to take control of Gotham&#x27;s East Side, then controlled by Catwoman. Catwoman joins Strange&#x27;s gang, then allows its members to &quot;find out&quot; that she intends to betray them, faking her death when they attempt to eliminate her. Although she defeats and imprisons most of the gang, and even convinces Strange to leave the East Side alone, Strange still mocks her by pointing out that he had faked his own death far more often than she had.

In &quot;Batman&quot; #665, Batman tells Tim Drake that a huge man dressed like a combination of Bane and Batman had beaten him up and he suspects that the impostor had used &quot;Hugo Strange&#x27;s monster serum and daily Venom shots&quot; to gain his size and strength.

In &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, Strange is associating with other supervillains such as the Mad Hatter, Doctor Death, and Two-Face. Strange and the others are rounded up by the Suicide Squad.

Strange takes part in the miniseries &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. He is among the supervillains imprisoned on another planet.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In the continuity of &quot;The New 52&quot;, the 2011 reboot of the DC Universe, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) introduces the reader to Hugo Strange&#x27;s son, Eli Strange, for the first time. Eli is first seen playing a game of poker with members of the Russian Mob, betting a valuable bracelet, winning big and cleaning house. Before he can walk away with his winnings, one of the mobsters forces him to play another hand, then discovers Eli&#x27;s sleeve is loaded with cards. Before he can have him killed, the criminals realize that their bracelet (Eli&#x27;s was a fake replica) had been stolen. Catwoman then pounces from the ceiling and takes out the entire group. She thanks Eli for being her distraction (the two having been working together the entire time) and tells him to run home to his father, which he is last seen doing.

Later, Strange tasks his son with overseeing an operation to dose Gotham with fear gas. The Scarecrow led Batman to believe that a small boy in a picture would be harmed unless he put a stop to it. Arriving at the scene, Batman realizes that the small boy was actually Eli. He manages to avert the disaster and Eli is arrested. Later, Batman reveals that &quot;Eli Strange&quot; is actually an alias and that the boy&#x27;s real name is Elliot Montrose.

In &quot;Forever Evil&quot;, Hugo Strange is among the supervillains recruited by the Crime Syndicate to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In the continuity of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, DC Comics&#x27; 2016 relaunch of its monthly superhero books, Hugo Strange appears during the &quot;Night of the Monster Men&quot; crossover story line. Although apparently now ignorant of Batman&#x27;s identity, he is now determined to prove his superiority by attacking Gotham with a group of &quot;Monster Men&quot; created from the corpses of his former patients as representations of what Strange perceives as Batman&#x27;s greatest flaws - his ego, grief, and fear - which ultimately provokes Batman into a confrontation at Strange&#x27;s office penthouse headquarters. Strange wears what he terms a &quot;suicide suit&quot; - a near-replica of the Batsuit without the cape and cowl that is rigged to detonate if its wearer is subjected to any physical attack - on the assumption that Batman will have no choice but to surrender the cowl to him as the &quot;true&quot; Batman since he cannot take a life. Nightwing is able to defeat the final monster - an amalgamation of the previous ones - by literally leaping inside it to inject it with a prepared antidote, while Batman outwits Strange by having his ally Clayface cover the penthouse in an airtight seal prior to the confrontation. Strange, delirious and running out of oxygen, loses consciousness while Batman is still standing, Nightwing musing that Strange failed to realize that Batman&#x27;s flaws were actually his motivation in protecting Gotham.

Hugo Strange later appears as a member of the Cabal alongside Doctor Psycho, Per Degaton, Queen Bee, and Amazo. 

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Hugo Strange appears in &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot;. This version is a eugenicist who seeks to improve the gene pool by removing those he considers &quot;unclean&quot;. In pursuit of this goal, he allies with the Penguin and Harvey Dent, using the latter for his access to Gotham City&#x27;s citizens&#x27; genes and control their future generations. However, Dent later betrays Strange and the Penguin to help the Batgirls. Strange flees and later receives funding from the Soviets to research and create clones of Supergirl. Chief among them are Power Girl, who became the Soviet Union&#x27;s secret weapon, and Superman, who he considered a failure. A year later, Strange captured Supergirl and Steve Trevor, intending to use her as a guinea pig to create an army to purge the world, only for Supergirl to turn Power Girl against him before the Reaper and Lois Lane find his lab and rescue his captives.

Hugo Strange appears several times throughout the Batman &#x27;66 comic book series as the chief psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum before being exposed as a villian and defeated in Batman &#x27;66 meets the Mam from U.N.C.L.E.

<text>Cranfield Point () is the southernmost point of Northern Ireland. It is located at the mouth of Carlingford Lough in the townland of Cranfield, County Down.

It was once the site of the Cranfield Point lighthouse, marking the entrance to the lough. Its poor position led to the construction of the Haulbowline Lighthouse situated in the middle of the entrance to Carlingford Lough. Cranfield Point Lighthouse subsequently fell victim to coastal erosion and collapsed into the sea during the 1860s. The lighthouse keeper&#x27;s cottage remained and was later converted into a private residence that can still be seen as of 2007, identified by its characteristic tall black chimneys.

<doc id="864595" wikidata="Q5452926" url="?curid=864595" title="First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC">
<text>The First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC (commonly shortened to First Draft) is an incomplete 101-page document written by John von Neumann and distributed on June 30, 1945 by Herman Goldstine, security officer on the classified ENIAC project. It contains the first published description of the logical design of a computer using the stored-program concept, which has come to be known as the von Neumann architecture; the name has become controversial due to von Neumann&#x27;s failure to name other contributors.

==History==

Von Neumann wrote the report by hand while commuting by train to Los Alamos, New Mexico and mailed the handwritten notes back to Philadelphia. Goldstine had the report typed and duplicated. While the date on the typed report is June 30, 24 copies of the &quot;First Draft&quot; were distributed to persons closely connected with the EDVAC project five days earlier on June 25. Interest in the report caused it to be sent all over the world; Maurice Wilkes of Cambridge University cited his excitement over the report&#x27;s content as the impetus for his decision to travel to the United States for the Moore School Lectures in Summer 1946.

==Synopsis==
Von Neumann describes a detailed design of a &quot;very high speed automatic digital computing system.&quot; He divides it into six major subdivisions: a central arithmetic part, CA; a central control part, CC; memory, M; input, I; output, O; and (slow) external memory, R, such as punched cards, Teletype tape, or magnetic wire or steel tape.

The CA will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Other mathematical operations, such as logarithms and trigonometric functions are to be done with table look up and interpolation, possibly biquadratic. He notes that multiplication and division could be done with logarithm tables, but to keep the tables small enough, interpolation would be needed and this in turn requires multiplication, though perhaps with less precision.

Numbers are to be represented in binary notation. He estimates 27 binary digits (he did not use the term &quot;bit,&quot; which was coined by Claude Shannon in 1948) would be sufficient (yielding 8 decimal place accuracy) but rounds up to 30-bit numbers with a sign bit and a bit to distinguish numbers from orders, resulting in a 32-bit word he calls a &quot;minor cycle.&quot; Two&#x27;s complement arithmetic is to be used, simplifying subtraction. For multiplication and division, he proposes placing the binary point after the sign bit, which means all numbers are treated as being between −1 and +1 and therefore computation problems must be scaled accordingly.

===Circuit design===
Vacuum tubes are to be used rather than relays due to tubes&#x27; ability to operate in one microsecond vs. 10 milliseconds for relays.

Von Neumann suggests (Sec. 5.6) keeping the computer as simple as possible, avoiding any attempt at improving performance by overlapping operations. Arithmetic operations are to be performed one binary digit at a time. He estimates addition of two binary digits as taking one microsecond and that therefore a 30-bit multiplication should take about 302 microseconds or about one millisecond, much faster than any computing device available at the time.

Von Neumann&#x27;s design is built up using what he call &quot;E elements,&quot; which are based on the biological neuron as model, but are digital devices which he says can be constructed using one or two vacuum tubes. In modern terms his simplest E element is a two-input AND gate with one input inverted (the inhibit input). E elements with more inputs have an associated threshold and produce an output when the number of positive input signals meets or exceed the threshold, so long as the (only) inhibit line is not pulsed. He states that E elements with more inputs can be constructed from the simplest version, but suggests they be built directly as vacuum tube circuits as fewer tubes will be needed.

More complex function blocks are to be built from these E elements. He shows how to use these E elements to build circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root, as well as two state memory blocks and control circuits. He does not use Boolean logic terminology.

Circuits are to be synchronous with a master system clock derived from a vacuum tube oscillator, possibly crystal controlled. His logic diagrams include an arrowhead symbol to denote a unit time delay, as time delays must be accounted for in a synchronous design. He points out that in one microsecond an electric pulse moves 300 meters so that until much higher clock speeds, e.g. 108 cycles per second (100 MHz), wire length would not be an issue.

The need for error detection and correction is mentioned but not elaborated.

===Memory design===
A key design concept enunciated, and later named the Von Neumann architecture, is a uniform memory containing both numbers (data) and orders (instructions).
&quot;The device requires a considerable memory. While it appeared that various parts of this memory have to perform functions which differ somewhat in their nature and considerably in their purpose, it is nevertheless tempting to treat the entire memory as one organ, and to have its parts even as interchangeable as possible for the various functions enumerated above.&quot; (Sec. 2.5)

&quot;The orders which are received by CC come from M, i.e. from the same place where the numerical material is stored.&quot; (Sec. 14.0)
Von Neumann estimates the amount of memory required based on several classes of mathematical problems, including ordinary and partial differential equations, sorting and probability experiments. Of these, partial differential equations in two dimensions plus time will require the most memory, with three dimensions plus time being beyond what can be done using technology that was then available. He concludes that memory will be the largest subdivision of the system and he proposes 8,192 minor cycles (words) of 32-bits as a design goal, with 2,048 minor cycles still being useful. He estimates a few hundred minor cycles will suffice for storing the program.

He proposes two kinds of fast memory, delay line and iconoscope tube. Each minor cycle is to be addressed as a unit (word addressing, Sec. 12.8).
Instructions are to be executed sequentially, with a special instruction to switch to a different point in memory (i.e. a jump instruction).

Binary digits in a delay line memory pass through the line and are fed back to the beginning. Accessing data in a delay line imposes a time penalty while waiting for the desired data to come around again. After analyzing these timing issues, he proposes organizing the delay line memory into 256 delay line &quot;organs&quot; (DLAs) each storing 1024 bits, or 32 minor cycles, called a &quot;major cycle.&quot; A memory access first selects the DLA (8 bits) and then the minor cycle within the DLA (5 bits), for a total of 13 address bits.

For the iconoscope memory, he recognizes that each scan point on the tube face is a capacitor and that a capacitor can store one bit. Very high precision scanning will be needed and the memory will only last a short time, perhaps as little as a second, and therefore will need to be periodically recopied (refreshed).

===Orders (instructions)===
In Sec 14.1 von Neumann proposes the format for orders, which he calls a code. Order types include the basic arithmetic operations, moving minor cycles between CA and M (word load and store in modern terms), an order (&quot;s&quot;) that selects one of two numbers based on the sign of the previous operation, input and output and transferring CC to a memory location elsewhere (a jump). He determines the number of bits needed for the different order types, suggests &quot;immediate orders&quot; where the following word is the operand and discusses the desirability of leaving spare bits in the order format to allow for more addressable memory in the future, as well as other unspecified purposes. The possibility of storing more than one order in a minor cycle is discussed, with little enthusiasm for that approach. A table of orders is provided, but no discussion of input and output instructions was included in the First Draft.

==Controversy==
The issuance and distribution of the report was the source of bitter acrimony between factions of the EDVAC design team for two reasons. First, the report was later ruled a public disclosure that occurred more than a year before the EDVAC patent application was filed, thereby rendering the eventual patent unenforceable; second, some on the EDVAC design team contended that the stored-program concept had evolved out of meetings at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering predating von Neumann&#x27;s activity as a consultant there, and that much of the work represented in the &quot;First Draft&quot; was no more than a translation of the discussed concepts into the language of formal logic in which von Neumann was fluent. Hence, failure of von Neumann and Goldstine to list others as authors on the &quot;First Draft&quot; led credit to be attributed to von Neumann alone. (See Matthew effect and Stigler&#x27;s law.)

<text>HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, official symbol HMGCR) is the rate-controlling enzyme (NADH-dependent, ; NADPH-dependent, ) of the mevalonate pathway, the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids. HMGCR catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is competitively suppressed so that its effect is controlled. This enzyme is the target of the widely available cholesterol-lowering drugs known collectively as the statins, which help treat dyslipidemia.

HMG-CoA reductase is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, and was long regarded as having seven transmembrane domains, with the active site located in a long carboxyl terminal domain in the cytosol. More recent evidence shows it to contain eight transmembrane domains.

In humans, the gene for HMG-CoA reductase (NADPH) is located on the long arm of the fifth chromosome (5q13.3-14). Related enzymes having the same function are also present in other animals, plants and bacteria.

== Structure ==
The main isoform (isoform 1) of HMG-CoA reductase in humans is 888 amino acids long. It is a polytopic transmembrane protein (meaning it possesses many alpha helical transmembrane segments). It contains two main domains:
*a conserved N-terminal sterol-sensing domain (SSD, amino acid interval: 88–218). The related SSD of SCAP has been shown to bind cholesterol.
*a C-terminal catalytic domain (amino acid interval: 489-871), namely the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase domain. This domain is required for the proper enzymatic activity of the protein.

Isoform 2 is 835 amino acids long. This variant is shorter because it lacks an exon in the middle region (amino acids 522–574). This does not affect any of the aforementioned domains.

== Function ==
HMGCR catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, a necessary step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol:
Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is competitively suppressed by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor as well as oxidized species of cholesterol. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, which is considered, by those who accept the standard lipid hypothesis, an important determinant of atherosclerosis. This enzyme is thus the target of the widely available cholesterol-lowering drugs known collectively as the statins (see &quot;Drugs&quot; section for more).

In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, Hmgcr is the homolog of Human HMGCR, and plays crucial roles in regulating energy metabolism and food intake but also sleep homeostasis through the central mechanisms according to these studies

===Interactive pathway map===
== Inhibitors ==

=== Drugs ===
Drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, known collectively as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or &quot;statins&quot;), are used to lower serum cholesterol as a means of reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease.

These drugs include rosuvastatin (CRESTOR), lovastatin (Mevacor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), pravastatin (Pravachol), fluvastatin (Lescol), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor). Red yeast rice extract, one of the fungal sources from which the statins were discovered, contains several naturally occurring cholesterol-lowering molecules known as monacolins. The most active of these is monacolin K, or lovastatin (previously sold under the trade name Mevacor, and now available as generic lovastatin).

Vytorin is drug that combines the use simvastatin and ezetimibe, which slows the formation of cholesterol by every cell in the body, along with ezetimibe reducing absorption of cholesterol, typically by about 53%, from the intestines.

Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are competent in lowering cholesterol levels and reducing cardiac-related diseases. However, there have been controversies surrounding the potential of statins increasing the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD). Experiments have demonstrated that glucose and cholesterol homeostasis are regulated by statins. The HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), converts HMG-CoA into mevalonic acid. Thus, when HMGCR activities are reduced, the cell associated cholesterols are also reduced. This results in the activation of SREBP-2-mediated signaling pathways. SREBP-2 activation for cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for the upregulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR). The removal of LDL particles from blood circulation is enhanced when the number of LDLR on hepatocytes increases. Due to the removal of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, such as LDLs and intermediate density lipoproteins, HMGCR inhibitors have been proven to be efficient in reducing cardiovascular diseases from the blood circulation, which is represented by the reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels. In many studies, lipophilic statins are shown as more diabetogenic, possibly due to the fact that they can easily diffuse into cells and inhibit the production of isoprenoids which become more potent. Additionally, statins have been shown to change glucose levels as well.

=== Hormones ===
HMG-CoA reductase is active when blood glucose is high. The basic functions of insulin and glucagon are to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, in controlling blood sugar levels, they indirectly affect the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, but a decrease in activity of the enzyme is caused by AMP-activated protein kinase, which responds to an increase in AMP concentration, and also to leptin.

== Clinical significance ==
Since the reaction catalysed by HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, this enzyme represents the sole major drug target for contemporary cholesterol-lowering drugs in humans. The medical significance of HMG-CoA reductase has continued to expand beyond its direct role in cholesterol synthesis following the discovery that statins can offer cardiovascular health benefits independent of cholesterol reduction. Statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, most likely as a result of their ability to limit production of key downstream isoprenoids that are required for portions of the inflammatory response. It can be noted that blocking of isoprenoid synthesis by statins has shown promise in treating a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory autoimmune disease.

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins is lessened in patients with type 2 diabetes, which results in lessened inhibition of coronary atheromatous plaque, development.

HMG-CoA reductase is an important developmental enzyme. Inhibition of its activity and the concomitant lack of isoprenoids that yields can lead to germ cell migration defects as well as intracerebral hemorrhage.

Homozygous mutation of HMGCR can lead to a form of limb girdle myopathy that may share features with mild statin-induced myopathy. The clinical syndrome was partially reversed in a model system by supplementation with the downstream metabolite mevalonolactone.

The presence of anti HMG-CoA reductase antibodies is seen in people with statin-associated autoimmune myopathy, which is a very rare form of muscle damage caused by the immune system in people who take statin medications. The exact mechanism is unclear. A combination of consistent findings on physical examination, the presence of anti HMG-CoA reductase antibodies in a person with myopathy, evidence of muscle breakdown, and muscle biopsy diagnose SAAM.

== Regulation ==

Regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is achieved at several levels: transcription, translation, degradation and phosphorylation.

=== Transcription ===
Transcription of the reductase gene is enhanced by the &quot;sterol regulatory element binding protein&quot; (SREBP). This protein binds to the &quot;sterol regulatory element&quot; (SRE), located on the 5&#x27; end of the reductase gene after controlled proteolytic processing. When SREBP is inactive, it is bound to the ER or nuclear membrane with another protein called SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). SCAP senses low cholesterol concentration and transports SREBP to the Golgi membrane where a consecutive proteolysis by S1P and S2P cleaves SREBP into an active nuclear form, nSREBP. nSREBPs migrate to the nucleus and activate transcription of SRE-containing genes. The nSREBP transcription factor is short-lived. When cholesterol levels rise, Insigs retains the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER membrane by preventing its incorporation into COPII vesicles.

=== Translation ===
Translation of mRNA is inhibited by a mevalonate derivative, which has been reported to be the isoprenoid farnesol, although this role has been disputed.

=== Degradation ===
Rising levels of sterols increase the susceptibility of the reductase enzyme to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and proteolysis. Helices 2-6 (total of 8) of the HMG-CoA reductase transmembrane domain are thought to sense increased cholesterol levels (direct sterol binding to the SSD of HMG-CoA reductase has not been demonstrated). Lysine residues 89 and 248 can become ubiquinated by ER-resident E3 ligases. The identity of the multiple E3 ligases involved in HMG-CoA degradation is controversial, with suggested candidates being AMFR, Trc8, and RNF145 The involvement of AMFR and Trc8 has been contested.

=== Phosphorylation ===
Short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is achieved by inhibition by phosphorylation (of Serine 872, in humans). Decades ago it was believed that a cascade of enzymes controls the activity of HMG-CoA reductase: an HMG-CoA reductase kinase was thought to inactivate the enzyme, and the kinase in turn was held to be activated via phosphorylation by HMG-CoA reductase kinase kinase. An excellent review on regulation of the mevalonate pathway by Nobel Laureates Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown adds specifics: HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated and inactivated by an AMP-activated protein kinase, which also phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis. Thus, both pathways utilizing acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis are inactivated when energy charge is low in the cell, and concentrations of AMP rise. There has been a great deal of research on the identity of upstream kinases that phosphorylate and activate the AMP-activated protein kinase.

Fairly recently, LKB1 has been identified as a likely AMP kinase kinase, which appears to involve calcium/calmodulin signaling. This pathway likely transduces signals from leptin, adiponectin, and other signaling molecules.

<doc id="864603" wikidata="Q974160" url="?curid=864603" title="Cudgel War">
<text>The Cudgel War (also known as the Club War; ; ) was a 1596–1597 peasant uprising in Finland, which was then part of the Kingdom of Sweden. The name of the uprising derives from the fact that the peasants armed themselves with various blunt weapons, such as cudgels, flails, and maces, since they were seen as the most efficient weapons against their heavily-armoured enemies. The yeomen also had swords, some firearms, and two cannons at their disposal. Their opponents, the troops of Clas Eriksson Fleming, were professional, heavily-armed and armoured men-at-arms.

Modern Finnish historiography sees the uprising in the context of the conflict between Duke Charles and Sigismund, King of Sweden and Poland (War against Sigismund). Charles agitated the peasants to revolt against the nobility of Finland, which supported Sigismund during the conflict.

==Background==
The 25-year war between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Tsardom of Russia had increased the tax burden, the most hated of which was the &quot;castle camp&quot;, i.e. the accommodation, subsistence and payment of wages at the expense of the peasants. The peasants found it intolerable, in particular, that noble and inferior squires who equipped cavalry soldiers for the army were allowed to collect castle camp dues even when the soldiers were not at war, and that Klaus Fleming kept the army in the castle camp for many years after the war to keep it available for his use. There were many abuses and illegalities towards the peasants committed by the nobles and their armies in collecting castle camp dues. Other key explanations for the outbreak of cudgel warfare have included &quot;the burdens of wartime and severe failed harvests, the chaos caused by war fatigue, political provocations, and the exploitation of peasants by a nobility who grew in number and wealth&quot;.

==War==
An uprising began on Christmas Eve 1595 and was initially successful, but shortly thereafter was crushed by cavalry. Officially, the Cudgel War began in Ostrobothnia with an attack by peasants on Isokyrö&#x27;s church on 25 November 1596. The peasants won a number of encounters with infantry. Klaus Fleming began negotiating a truce that required the surrender of peasant leader Jaakko Ilkka. Ilkka, along with his wife and some of his men, fled to avoid being handed over and the peasant army scattered, pursued by the soldiers. At least 1,500 were killed within the next two months. Along with Ilkka, five other rebellion leaders were executed on 27 January 1597.
Israel Larsson was named as the new governor of central and northern Ostrobothnia, and planned to support the rebellion until he fled, rather than face Fleming. Leaderless, the peasants attacked on 24 February 1597, and fought their last battle on the Santavuori Hill in Ilmajoki. Over 1,000 were killed and 500 captured.

The insurgents were mostly Finnish peasants from Ostrobothnia, Northern Tavastia, and Savo. The events can also be seen as a part of a larger power struggle between King Sigismund and Duke Charles.

==Legacy==
In his work &quot;Nuijasota, sen syyt ja tapaukset&quot; (1857–1859) (), historian and fennoman Yrjö Koskinen (né Forsman) saw the peasants as fighting for freedom and justice. Fredrika Runeberg&#x27;s &quot;Sigrid Liljeholm&quot; (1862), one of the first Finnish historical novels, depicts women&#x27;s fates during the war. Albert Edelfelt&#x27;s painting &quot;Burned Village&quot; (1879) depicts a woman, a child, and an old man hiding behind a rock as a village burns in the background. The poet Kaarlo Kramsu praised the insurgents and lamented their defeat in patriotic poems such as &quot;Ilkka&quot;, &quot;Hannu Krankka&quot;, and &quot;Santavuoren tappelu&quot;, published in &quot;Runoelmia&quot; (1887). After the Finnish Civil War, the debate has centered on an interpretation that emphasizes Duke Charles&#x27;s role in inciting the revolt, as found in Pentti Renvall&#x27;s &quot;Kuninkaanmiehiä ja kapinoitsijoita Vaasa-kauden Suomessa&quot; (1949); and an explanation that stresses the roots of the rebellion in social injustice and class conflict, as argued by Heikki Ylikangas in &quot;Nuijasota&quot; (1977). A historical reenactment of the Cudgel War is conducted yearly in the Kavalahti scout camp. Jaakko Ilkka took the 75th place in the &quot;Great Finns&quot; TV show. A commemorative silver coin was also minted to mark the occasion.

<text>Domitia Lepida (c. 5 BC – AD 54) was a Roman aristocrat, related to the imperial family. She was mother of Valeria Messalina, wife of the Emperor Claudius. Lepida was a beautiful and influential figure. Like her sister, she was also very wealthy. She had holdings in Calabria and owned the &quot;praedia Lepidiana&quot;.

==Biography==
Lepida was the daughter of Antonia Major and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and granddaughter to triumvir Mark Antony by Octavia Minor, a great-niece of the Roman Emperor Augustus. She had two siblings: Domitia and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul AD 32).

Lepida was married three times. Her first husband was her cousin, Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus. Lepida married Barbatus probably around AD 15, suggesting that she was born in approximately 4 BC. It was standard for princesses in the imperial family to marry before their 18th birthday. They had a daughter, Valeria Messalina (c. AD 17/20-48), who became Empress and third wife to the Emperor Claudius. Barbatus most likely died around AD 20 or 21, shortly after Messalina was born. It is extremely unlikely that Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus was their son, since Lepida&#x27;s son by her second husband reached the consulship earlier than Messalla. Lepida&#x27;s second husband was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, consul in AD 31, a descendant of the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Their son, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix was born c. AD 22 and married Claudia Antonia, the daughter of Claudius through his second marriage to Aelia Paetina. Faustus Cornelius Sulla died in 62.

At the beginning of the reign of her son-in-law, Claudius, Lepida, now a widow, married Appius Junius Silanus, (cos. AD 28). In the following year (AD 42), Silanus was put to death by Claudius, allegedly because he had plotted to assassinate Claudius, but the rumor circulated that Messalina had framed him after he resisted her advances.

Lepida was the maternal grandmother to Messalina&#x27;s children Claudia Octavia (step-sister and first wife of Nero) and Britannicus. In AD 48, Messalina was executed on the orders of Claudius, due to Messalina&#x27;s mock marriage with her lover Gaius Silius which swiftly evolved into a failed coup d&#x27;état. During Messalina&#x27;s heyday, Lepida argued with Messalina and they became estranged (this likely followed Appius Silanus&#x27; execution). In Messalina&#x27;s last hour in the Gardens of Lucullus, Lepida was at her side and encouraged her to end her own life. After Messalina was stabbed with a dagger by an officer, her body was given up to Lepida.

Lepida&#x27;s former sister-in-law, Agrippina the Younger, became Claudius&#x27; new wife in AD 49. Out of jealousy, Agrippina arranged the execution of Lepida sometime before the poisoning of Claudius, after which Nero became the new emperor. Agrippina charged Lepida with attempting to take her life by magic, disturbing Roman peace, and failing to control her Calabrian slave-gangs. Agrippina thought that Lepida would use her &#x27;kind&#x27; influence on Nero to turn him against his mother.

==Cultural depictions==
She was played by Moira Redmond in the 1976 BBC TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

<text>Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears () is a 1980 Soviet romantic drama film made by Mosfilm. It was written by Valentin Chernykh and directed by Vladimir Menshov. The leading roles were played by Vera Alentova and Aleksey Batalov. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1981.

==Plot==

Part One

In 1958, three young women, Katerina, Lyudmila, and Antonina, live in Moscow in a workers&#x27; dormitory, having arrived from province.

Katerina, serious and hardworking, works in a factory while studying at night to get admitted to a college. Antonina, a construction worker, dates her fellow co-worker Nikolay, a reserved but kind young man. Lyudmila, dynamic and vivacious, works in a bakery, but spends time in a university library in a search for the opportunity to marry up.

When asked to house-sit for her well-to-do Moscow relatives, Lyudmila, flirty and impetuous, invites herself along and convinces Katerina to throw a dinner party as a ploy to meet successful men. At the party, Lyudmila talks with Sergei, a rising ice hockey star, while Katerina meets Rudolf, a smooth talker who works as a cameraman for a national TV channel.

During Antonina and Nikolai&#x27;s wedding, Lyudmila and Antonina learn that Katerina is pregnant. Rudolf refuses to marry Katerina and is not willing to help with finding an abortion clinic. His mother offers Katerina money, while telling her that they will not have her as a part of the family. Katerina rejects the money, telling her that she plans to have an abortion. In the next scene, her friends greet her with a new born daughter, Aleksandra. Three friends and their guests celebrate the arrival of the baby in their dormitory room.

In the last scene of Part One, Katerina, exhausted, studies at night, with Aleksandra sleeping by her side. Going to bed, Katerina changes the alarm clock from 6am to 5:30am, and cries.

Part Two

Twenty years later, in 1978, Katerina is a newly appointed CEO of a large factory. She drives a car, a sign of privileged status in the Soviet Union, and lives with her teen-age daughter in a nice apartment. She, Lyudmila and Antonina are still close. Lyudmila has divorced Sergei, who has quit playing hockey because of problems with alcohol; she works at a dry-cleaning and still looks for a bridegroom (preferably a general). Antonina is still married to Nikolai; with three teen-age children, they are a loving and harmonious family. Katerina dates a married man, but her private life is not happy.

Returning home on a local train, Katerina meets Gosha, who starts a conversation with her after she notices his dirty shoes. Gosha is an intelligent tool-and-die maker in a research institute, where his instrument maintenance skills are an enormously valued help to his scientist coworkers. Katerina starts dating him, yet she does not tell him that she is a factory CEO as Gosha believes that a woman should not make more money than her husband.

As their romance progresses, Rudolf, who changed his westernized name for a now-fashionable russified Rodion, but still works as a TV cameraman, unexpectedly reenters Katerina&#x27;s life, and tells her he wants to meet his daughter. Katerina curtly tells him that she does not want to see him again, but he shows up uninvited at her apartment and tells Gosha and Aleksandra about the interview, revealing Katerina&#x27;s executive position (and high salary) to Gosha. Gosha&#x27;s pride is hurt, and he leaves the apartment. Unable to stop him, Katerina reveals to Aleksandra that Rudolf is her father.

Gosha disappears from Katerina&#x27;s life, and she becomes frantic. A week later, Lyudmila, Antonina, and Nikolai come to her apartment to comfort her. Nikolai gathers what little information Katerina knows about Gosha (which does not even include his last name) and finds him drinking alone, still stung by Katerina&#x27;s &quot;betrayal&quot;. Nikolai convinces Gosha to return home, and, alone with Katerina and Aleksandra, Gosha asks for a dinner. As he eats, Katerina watches him, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been looking for you for such a long time.&quot; &quot;Eight days&quot;, Gosha replies, to which Katerina, with tears in her eyes, repeats, &quot;I&#x27;ve been looking for you for such a long time.&quot;

==Reception==
===Response===
Over 93 million Soviet viewers saw the film in the cinema, making it one of the most successful films in Soviet history. In 2021, a poll conducted by Russian Public Opinion Research Center voted it as the best Soviet film of all time among Russian viewers. &quot;Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears&quot; has an approval rating of 40% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 5 reviews, and an average rating of 4.8/10.
The film currently holds a rating of 8.1/10 on IMDb.

Then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan watched the film several times before his meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in order to gain a better understanding of the &quot;Russian soul&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
== Background ==
* &quot;Moskva slezam ne verit&quot;, translated officially as &quot;Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears&quot;, is a Russian proverb meaning &quot;don&#x27;t complain, solve your problems by yourself&quot;.
* Valentin Chernykh admitted that he received many proposals from Hollywood at that time, but he rejected all of them, since he thought that any remakes of the movie would fail.
* Vitaly Solomin, Vyacheslav Tikhonov, Oleg Yefremov, and Leonid Dyachkov auditioned for the part of Gosha. However, none of them convinced the director to take them, and he even wanted to play the main character himself, until he saw Aleksey Batalov in the film &quot;My Dear Man&quot; on television.
* It was also difficult to find someone apt for the part of Katerina. Many well known actresses such as Anastasiya Vertinskaya, Zhanna Bolotova, Irina Kupchenko, Natalya Sayko, Valentina Telichkina and Margarita Terekhova auditioned for the part, but most of them did not like the script, so the part eventually went to the director’s wife, Vera Alentova.

<text>Kursk (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Kursk Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Kur, Tuskar, and Seym rivers. It has a population of 

Kursk is the oldest city in the oblast, recorded in 1032 as part of the Kievan Rus&#x27;. It became the seat of a small eponymous principality in the 13th century, before passing to Lithuanian rule in the late medieval period, and then to Moscow in the early modern period. Kursk has served as the seat of regional administration since 1779. The area around Kursk was the site of a turning point in the Soviet–German struggle during World War II and the site of the single largest battle in history.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
Kursk was originally built as a fortress city on a hill dominating the plain. The settlement was surrounded on three sides by the Kur River (Amur basin) to the west and the Tuskar river to the south and east. Forest thickets approached it from the north. By 1603, Kursk had become the military, administrative, and economic centre of a vast territory in the south of the country. The new fortress was built under the leadership of governors Ivan Polev and Nelyub Ogaryov. The Kursk fortress was given a particularly important role, since in these places the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate, who made regular slave raids on Russia, traditionally crossed the Seym river, and their main road, the Muravsky Trail, passed east of the city. In this regard, Kursk, despite not being part of the Belgorod Protection Line, became one of the most important fortresses in the southern region. In 1616, there were 1600 people in the Kursk garrison.

By 1782, the buildings of Kursk were located on the heights of two hills and in the valley of the Kur River. There were meadows and pastures on the banks of the river. The city streets that laid on the slopes of the hills had steep ascents and descents in many places, and travel in the city was made uphill almost everywhere. The presence of six ravines that cut through the hill of the Nagornaya part significantly hampered the development of Kursk. Heavy rains sometimes eroded the soil of the hillsides and formed ditches and gullies. The plan of Kursk in 1782 was to be implemented in the conditions of the existing buildings of the city. In the 1880s, Kursk was already a significant settlement. It housed 14 churches, not including the churches of the Znamensky Monastery. Most of them were of stone and built around the time period of 1730 to 1786. By 1782, Kursk was composed almost entirely of wooden houses. Fences and services went out in the direction of the streets, and houses were hidden in the depths of the courtyards. Many streets and lanes were no wider than 2.5 to 3 metres. The only stone mansion that has survived in present time after redevelopment is located at the corner of Pionerov (former Troitskaya) and Gaidar (former Zolotarevskaya) streets.

There were powerful fortifications and natural obstacles in the center of Kursk. Settlements were located around the city. Cossack and Pushkarnaya were on the slopes of the hills and in the valley of the Kur River, Yamskaya – away from the city, on the plain. At that time, Yamskaya was a small village concentrated around the Vvedenskaya church. The settlements Streletskaya and Kozhevenny were located in the lowlands and were often flooded by the Tuskar river.

The principle of regularity was applied in the structure of the general layout of Kursk. On the plan of 1782, Kursk is shown as consisting of two parts: the cities of Nagornaya and Zakurnaya. They are separated from each other by the Kura river valley. Each of these parts is divided into regular rectangular blocks located on both sides of the planned main streets – Bolshaya Moskovskaya (Lenina) and Kherson (Dzerzhinsky). In the city Nagornaya part, 19 streets were planned, and in the Zakurnaya part, 24 streets. At the entrance to the city, at the beginning of both Moskovskaya and Kherson streets, it was planned to arrange the entrance squares. The remains of the former prison were destroyed, and the moat was buried according to the plan of the city, which was most confirmed in 1782. A square called “red ” was made in its place. The construction of small areas was also envisaged for a number of churches throughout the city. The territory of both parts of the city, where it was not limited by rivers and deep ravines, was planned to be surrounded by a ditch and a rampart. The area occupied by the city according to the new plan totalled approximately 3060 thousand square fathoms, which corresponds to 12 square kilometres. The main drawback of the project was that it did not take into account the complex relief of the Kursk area. The structure of the plan, correct and orderly on paper, required significant revision, additions and even minor changes. The numerous proposals of the Kursk governors A.A. Prozorovsky, F.N. Nicknames, A.B. Debalmena, and A.A. Bekleshov, included in the city planning, made it possible to bring the scheme closer to reality.

The purpose of the redevelopment was complete accounting and control of residents. For this, the city was divided under the governor Alexander Bekleshov into 4 parts, each of which was managed by a private bailiff. The redevelopment of the city was begun by the provincial surveyor Ivan Fedorovich Bashilov, the district surveyor Ivan Shoshin, the provincial architects Vasily Yakovlev, Lavrenty Kalinovsky. Since 1783, decisions on redevelopment issues were made by a commission in the amount of 3 officials, namely the provincial land surveyor, the mayor and the city magistrate&#x27;s ratman. The new urban structure – a rectangular quarter with residents of the same income, one estate – greatly facilitated the accounting and control of the inhabitants by the authorities. The center of the city, built up with stone buildings, was to take on a new, &quot;ceremonial&quot; appearance. These requirements were met by the resettlement of residents on the basis of class. The most significant government buildings erected in Kursk by the end of the 18th century. In accordance with the plan confirmed by Catherine II, these were public places, a prison, a guest house, the main public school, and a house of a noble assembly. The construction of the bank office, magistrate and post office was located along the red lines of the development of Florovskaya and Moskovskaya streets. The general plan for the development of Kursk was adopted in 1782. It was built according to a regular plan with a clear rectangular grid of streets. It was based on the two main streets Moskovskaya and Khersonskaya (now Lenin and Dzerzhinsky), converging at right angles on Red Square.

A city hospital, a regimental infirmary, an almshouse, and salt shops were built. The most notable private houses of the late 18th century that have survived to this day are the houses of the landowner Denisiev (corner of Sadovaya and Semyonovskaya) and the official Puzanov (Dzerzhinsky, 70), as well as the &quot;house of the treasurer&quot; (corner of Radishcheva and Marata). The main significance of the general city plan of 1782 is that for about 150 years it remained the only document that determined the development of the city of Kursk. The next master plan appeared only in 1947, after the Second World War. The number of residential buildings from 1786 to 1836 increased insignificantly, from 1989 houses to 2782 houses. If any building did not correspond to the confirmed plan, it was demolished.

The bulk of government buildings (offices, post office, magistrate, prison, drinking houses, pharmacies, hospital) were built at the end of the 18th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, construction was carried out: offices were repaired, a new prison was built, and storm sewer grooves were laid along stone pavements, which almost half of Kursk&#x27;s streets had. The streets were named Sergievskaya, Tuskarnaya Naberezhnaya, Staraya, Novaya Preobrazhensky, General&#x27;s line, Soldier&#x27;s, Druzhininskaya, Pastukhovskaya. Zolotarevskaya, Avraamovskaya, and so on. On 10 July 1808, five settlements (Sloboda) of Kursk (Podyacheskaya, Soldatskaya, Gorodovy Sluzhby, Malyrossiyskaya, Rassylnaya) became part of the city. The settlements surrounding Kursk (Kazatskaya, Pushkarskaya, Yamskaya, Streletskaya) became part of the city only after 1917. The Kozhevennaya Sloboda disappeared from the city plan by the 1940s. The layout of the settlements was as regular as in the provincial center. Urban pasture land was located between the Seim River, on the border of the 3rd district of Kursk and the Big Post Road from Kursk to Oboyan.

==History==

===Medieval period===
The first written record of Kursk dates back to 1032. It was mentioned as one of Severian towns by Prince Igor in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;:

Saddle, brother, your swift steeds. As to mine, they are ready, saddled ahead, near Kursk; as to my Kurskers, they are famous knights—swaddled under war-horns, nursed under helmets, fed from the point of the lance; to them the trails are familiar, to them the ravines are known, the bows they have are strung tight, the quivers, unclosed, the sabers, sharpened; themselves, like gray wolves, they lope in the field, seeking for themselves honor, and for their prince, glory.

The seat of the minor principality of Kievan Rus&#x27;, Kursk was raided by the Turkic-speaking Polovtsians in the 12th and 13th centuries. Destroyed by the Mongols under Batu Khan during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; around 1237, the city was rebuilt no later than 1283. Between 1360 and 1508, it was ruled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Kursk joined the centralized Russian state in 1508, becoming its southern border province.

===Modern period===
However, a century later the city re-emerged in a new place; date of re-considered grounds Kursk 1586 [9]. In 1596 a new fortress was built, which was garrisoned by over 1,300 soldiers in 1616. At the beginning of the 17th century, Kursk was repeatedly attacked by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth forces during the Polish–Russian Wars (in 1612, 1616, 1617, and 1634), and was also attacked by the Crimean Khanate and the Nogai Horde during the Crimean–Nogai slave raids on Russia, but the Kursk fortress was never taken.

Residents of Oryol and other southern Russian cities were resettled in Kursk (by 1678, 2,800 had been resettled). The city developed due to its advantageous geographical position on the shortest route from Moscow to the Crimea and from Moscow to Kiev. It was an important center of the corn trade with Ukraine and hosted an important fair, which took place annually under the walls of the monastery of Our Lady of Kursk.

During the period of the Russian Empire, it was successively part of the Kiev Governorate (1708–1727), Belgorod Governorate (1727–1779), and Kursk Viceroyalty (1779–1797). The town status was granted to Kursk in 1779, and it became the administrative center of Kursk Governorate in 1797.

After a fire in 1781 devastated Kursk, a new plan for the city was developed in which a market center would be placed in the central square, known as the Red Square. In 1768, the Voskresensko-Ilinskaya Church was built (). In 1778 both the baroque Sergiev Cathedral and Trinity-Sergius Cathedral were completed. The city opened its first school for nobility in 1783. A men&#x27;s gymnasium was opened in 1808 and a seminary in 1817. A women&#x27;s gymnasium was opened in 1872.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Kursk played a dominant role in the food industry (Kvilitsu AK, one of the largest breweries in Russia, operated in Kursk) and in other industries; in the 1900s, the city had 4 sitoproboynye shops (of which the largest was the Tikhonov works, whose products were exported to Germany, Austria-Hungary, etc.). There were several engineering enterprises operating in Kursk (in 1914 there were seven, including a railroad one). The working conditions in the factories of Kursk were harsh, and workers&#x27; strikes were frequent (for instance, the workers at the sugar mill went on strike in 1901–1903). The Kursk workers also participated in the general political strike during the 1905 Russian Revolution.

After the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the Soviets took power in Kursk on 26 November (9 December – new style) 1917. On 28 November 1918, the Provisional Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Government of Ukraine was established in Kursk. On 20 September 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the city was taken over by the anti-Bolshevik troops under the command of General Denikin; however, on 19 November 1919, Kursk was retaken by the Red Army.
The Soviet government valued Kursk for its rich deposits of iron ore and developed it into one of the major railroad hubs in the Russian southwest. In 1932, Yamskaya Sloboda was incorporated into the city. In 1935, Kursk got its first tram system. Sometime in the 1930s, the area of the city of Kursk was divided into Leninsky District (the left bank of the Kura River), Dzerzhinsky District (the right bank of the Kura River) and Kirov District (Yamskaya Sloboda). In 1937 Stalinsky District was formed at the southern outskirts of the city.

During World War II, Kursk was occupied by Germany between . The occupiers operated a Jewish forced labour battalion in the city. In July 1943, the Germans launched Operation Citadel in an attempt to recapture Kursk. During the resulting Battle of Kursk, the village of Prokhorovka near Kursk became the center of a major armoured engagement – the Battle of Prokhorovka – between Soviet and German forces: one of the largest tank battles in history. Operation Citadel was the last major German offensive against the Soviet Union.
Rebuilding efforts in the city began in February 1944. The cultural life recovered as well: on 19 February a cinema was reopened, and on 27 February a drama theatre. By 1950 the urban economy had been completely restored. In 1953 the tram system began operating again. On 17 August 1956, Stalinsky District was renamed Promishlenost District, and Dzerzhinsky District was abolished and its territory divided between Promishlenost and Leninsky Districts.

===Recent history===
In 2009, for the first time in 90 years at the site of Theotokos of Kursk, the most revered icon in the Russian Orthodox Church, received the name Hodigitria Russian diaspora.

Until 2010, Kursk had the status of historical settlement, but the Russian Ministry of Culture deprived the city of this status on 29 July 2010 in resolution No. 418/339.

On 29 October 2011, for the first time in 30 years, the city opened a new firehouse for the protection of the Central District, with modern equipment. In 2012, Kursk celebrated its 980th anniversary.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Kursk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Kursky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Kursk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Kursk is incorporated as Kursk Urban Okrug.

==Economy and infrastructure==

In addition to its importance as an administrative hub, Kursk is important as an industrial centre. Activity focuses on iron-based industry, the chemical sector and a large food processing industry, reflecting the richness of agriculture in the surrounding &quot;Black Earth&quot; region.

Particularly noteworthy is the so-called Kursk Magnetic Anomaly &quot;(Russian: Курская магнитная аномалия)&quot;, the world&#x27;s largest known iron-ore reserve, where the iron content of the ore ranges from 35% up to 60%.

In Kurchatov, some to the south-west, is the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, incorporating four RBMK-1000 (&quot;High Power Channel-type Reactor&quot;) &quot;(Russian: Реактор Большой Мощности Канальный)&quot; reactors similar to those implicated in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The oldest of the Kursk reactors has been operational since 1977, and the newest of them since 1986.

==Attractions==

The oldest building in Kursk is the upper church of the Trinity Monastery, a good example of the transition style characteristic of Peter the Great&#x27;s early reign. The oldest lay building is the so-called Romodanovsky Chamber, although it was erected in all probability in the mid-18th century, when the Romodanovsky family had ceased to exist.

The city cathedral was built between 1752 and 1778 in the splendid Baroque style and was decorated so sumptuously that many art historians attributed it to Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Although Rastrelli&#x27;s authorship is out of the question, the cathedral is indeed the most impressive monument of Elizabethan Baroque not to be commissioned by the imperial family or built in the imperial capital.

The cathedral has two stories, with the lower church consecrated to St. Sergius of Radonezh and the upper one to the Theotokos of Kazan. The upper church is noted for an intricate icon screen which took sixteen years to complete. The three-story cathedral bell tower derives peculiar interest from the fact that Seraphim of Sarov, whose father took part in construction works, survived an accidental fall from its top floor at the age of seven. The Resurrection Church is also shown, where St. Seraphim was baptized.

The monastery cathedral of the Sign (1816–26) is another imposing edifice, rigorously formulated in the purest Neoclassical style, with a cupola measuring in diameter and rising high. The interior was formerly as rich as colored marbles, gilding, and frescoes could make it. During the Soviet period, the cathedral was desecrated, and four lateral domes and twin belltowers over the entrance were pulled down. There are plans to restore the church to its former glory.

The modern city is a home for several universities: Kursk State Medical University, State Technical University, Kursk State University (former Pedagogical University) and Agricultural Academy, as well as the private Regional Open Social Institute (ROSI). There are also modern shrines and memorials commemorating the Battle of Kursk, both in the city and in Prokhorovka.

The Command Station Bunker &amp; Museum was specifically built in memory of the courageous Russian T-34 tank units that fought in the Battle of Kursk, where a T-34 tank is on display. Over 6,000 armored vehicles fought in close range over the open territory near Kursk in 1943. This battle stopped the German advance into the Kursk Salient, and was a turning point of World War II on the Eastern Front.

Kursk played a role in the Cold War as host to Khalino air base.

Nearby is Tsentralno-Chernozemny Zapovednik, a large section of steppe soil that has never been plowed. It is used for a variety of research purposes.

==Education==
==Transportation==
Since 1868 there has been a railway connection between Kursk and Moscow. Kursk is located on a major railway line between Moscow and Kharkiv, with trains also linking the city to Voronezh and Kyiv.

Long-distance buses arrive and depart from the bus station &quot;Kursk&quot;, located in the North-West part of the city.

On 5 September 2011 an automated fare monitoring system was commissioned in Kursk. Implementation of the system in operation is carried out by Kursk Integrated Ticket System was to take place in three stages: At the initial stage is implemented partially open version of the system, in which the sale of tickets and travel control social cards carried in the cabin of public transport conductors with handheld validators, the second stage involves the installation of stationary validators, third – commissioning turnstiles. After completion of the implementation, the automated monitoring system drive will operate in &quot;closed&quot; mode: turnstiles will be installed at the entrance and exit of passengers. As of September 2011 turnstiles installed on 44 buses, 10 trolley buses and trams 5.

<text>In Islam, a mahram () is a family member with whom marriage would be considered permanently unlawful (&quot;haram&quot;). A woman does not need to wear hijab around her mahram or spouse, and an adult male mahram or husband may escort a woman on a journey, although an escort may not be obligatory.

==Overview==
===People with whom marriage is prohibited===
* permanent or blood &quot;mahrams&quot; include:
** all direct ancestors
** all direct descendants
** siblings
** siblings of parents, grandparents, and further antecedents
** children and further descendants of siblings
* in-law &quot;mahrams&quot; with whom one becomes &quot;mahram&quot; by marrying someone:
** all the ancestors of one&#x27;s spouse
** all the descendants of one&#x27;s spouse
** all who marry a direct ancestor 
** all who marry a direct descendant (A woman may marry her stepfather, but only if the stepfather has not consummated his marriage to her mother.) 
* &quot;Rada&quot; or &quot;milk-suckling &quot;mahrams&quot;&quot; with whom one becomes &quot;mahram&quot; because of being nursed by the same woman:
** foster mother 
** foster sibling

When a woman acts as a wetnurse (that is she breast feeds an infant that is not her own child for a certain amount of time under certain conditions), she becomes the child&#x27;s &quot;rada&quot; mother. In English these can be referred to as milk brother, milk-mother, and so on. For a man, &quot;mahram&quot; women include his mother, grandmother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, aunt, grandaunt, niece, grandniece, his father&#x27;s wife, his wife&#x27;s daughter (step-daughter), his daughter-in-law (if previously married to his biological son. She is not &quot;mahram&quot; if she was married to his adopted son), his mother-in-law, his &quot;rada&quot; mother and &quot;rada&quot; sister. According to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, &quot;What is forbidden by reason of kinship is forbidden by reason of suckling.&quot;

These are considered &quot;mahram&quot; because they are mentioned in the Quran (An-Nisa 22–23):

All of the man&#x27;s female relatives mentioned in these two verses are considered his &quot;maharim&quot;, because it is unlawful (&quot;haram&quot;) for him to marry them, except the wife&#x27;s sister, whom he can marry if he divorces her sister, or if his wife dies. The notion of &quot;mahram&quot; is reciprocal. All other relatives are considered non-&quot;maharim&quot;.

===Legal escorts of women during journey===

A woman may be legally escorted during a journey by her husband, or by any sane, adult male &quot;mahram&quot; by blood, although an escort may not be required, including:
* her father, grandfather or other male ancestor
* her son, grandson or other male descendant
* her brother
* her uncle, great uncle, or uncle from a previous generation
* the son, grandson, or other descendant of her sibling

==Rules==
===Mahram===
A Muslim woman&#x27;s &quot;mahrams&quot; form the group of allowable escorts when she travels.

For a spouse, being &quot;mahram&quot; is a permanent condition. That means, for example, that a man will remain &quot;mahram&quot; to his ex-mother-in-law after divorcing her daughter.

<text>The International Paneuropean Union, also referred to as the Pan-European Movement and the Pan-Europa Movement, is an international organisation and the oldest European unification movement. It began with the publishing of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Paneuropa&quot; (1923), which presented the idea of a unified European State. The Union&#x27;s General Secretariat is located in Munich, but maintains branches across Europe.

Since 2004, the President of the Union is Alain Terrenoire, former Member of Parliament in France and MEP and Director of the French Paneuropa-Union. Otto Habsburg became the International Honorary President of the International Paneuropean Union in 2004. The current vice president is Walburga Habsburg Douglas, a former member of the Swedish Parliament.

==History==

Coudenhove-Kalergi, a member of the Bohemian Coudenhove-Kalergi family and the son of an Austro-Hungarian diplomat and a Japanese mother, was the organisation&#x27;s central figure and President until his death in 1972.

As French prime minister and follower of the Paneuropean Union Aristide Briand delivered a widely recognized speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German enmity.

The organisation was prohibited by Nazi Germany in 1933, and was founded again after the Second World War. Winston Churchill lauded the movement&#x27;s work for a unified Europe prior to the war in his famous Zurich speech in 1946. The French branch was founded by Georges Pompidou and Louis Terrenoire, subsequently French President and Minister for Information respectively, with the support of Charles de Gaulle. Otto von Habsburg, the head of the Habsburg dynasty and former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, became involved with the Paneuropean Union in the 1930s, was elected its Vice President in 1957 and became its International President in 1973, after Coudenhove&#x27;s death. 

The organisation was much reviled by the communist regimes of the Eastern Bloc. The organisation became renowned for its role in organising the Pan-European Picnic, an important event during the Revolutions of 1989.

As of 2023, the Paneuropean Union Parliamentary Group in the European Parliament consists of over 120 members from nearly all of the EU Member States and meets regularly during the sessions of the Parliament in Strasbourg.

==Ideology==

The organisation believes in a strong, politically and militarily, united Europe while supporting humanist and Christian values. The EPU is committed to uniting the diverse peoples of Europe, promoting peace, liberty, and rule of law, and for developing stronger democracy and human rights across Europe. The organisation supports the enlargement of the European Union and encourages all European countries to gain full EU membership. The EPU advocates the EU to become an independent, self-sufficient, and peaceful superpower. The EPU also believes in maintaining a European Common Security and Defence Policy, and establishing a European army alongside strong cooperation with NATO.

<doc id="864629" wikidata="Q1343262" url="?curid=864629" title="Baby sling">
<text>A baby sling or baby carrier is a cloth device, usually of adjustable length, used to carry a baby securely against the wearer&#x27;s body. Slings have been used for millennia. They are usually made of soft fabric, and wrap around the carrier&#x27;s chest. Slings provide comfort and support for the baby and allow the parent or carer to keep their hands free as they go about their everyday tasks.

There are a wide variety of carriers available from wraps and ring slings to soft structured carriers and mei tais.

The use of a baby sling has been called babywearing.

==Types==

=== Ring slings ===
These are baby carriers that use dynamic tension, a length of cloth and metal (such as aluminum) or nylon rings. One end of the cloth is sewn to two rings. The cloth wraps around the wearer&#x27;s body from shoulder to opposite hip and back up to the shoulder, and the end is threaded through the rings to create a buckle effect. The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling is threaded, it can be taken off and put back on without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can put one arm and the head through the loop of cloth to put the sling back on.

When the baby is in the carrier, the baby&#x27;s weight puts tension on the fabric, and the combination of fabric tension, friction of fabric surfaces against each other and the rings combine to &quot;lock&quot; the sling in position. This type of sling can adjust to different wearers&#x27; sizes and accommodate different wearing positions easily. The wearer supports the baby&#x27;s weight with one hand and uses the other hand to pull more fabric through the rings to tighten or loosen the sling.

Ring slings may be padded or unpadded at the shoulder, have padded or unpadded edges or &quot;rails&quot;, and the &quot;tail&quot; of the sling may be open or closed. Some &quot;hybrid&quot; ring slings have curved seats sewn into the body, similar to the seam in a pouch. Ring slings are most closely related in use to the Mexican rebozo, the rings take the place of the knot.

Variation is also found in how the rings attach to the cloth, commonly referred to as &quot;shoulder style&quot;. Basic shoulder styles include gathered, pleated, &quot;hot dog&quot; or &quot;center fold&quot;, pouch-style (folded in half) and many variations.

Ring slings are highly adaptable and most care givers can wear a &quot;one size fits most&quot; size. As long as the tail is about 8&quot; long a ring sling is still considered safe. Tail length is decided by personal preference with most preferring the tail to hit about hip or mid thigh.

The recommended maximum weight limit for wearing baby in a ring sling is up to 35lbs.

=== Pouch slings ===
Sometimes called &quot;tube&quot;, &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;ringless&quot; slings, these are generally formed by a wide piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, Velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent&#x27;s body and hold the baby more securely than a simple straight tube. The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many paediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby&#x27;s chin is collapsed against his or her chest, constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent&#x27;s view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should be sure to keep the baby&#x27;s face elevated and clearly visible.

=== Wraps ===
Wraps (sometimes called &quot;wraparounds&quot; or &quot;wraparound slings&quot;) are lengths of fabric (usually between 2 metres and 6 metres, or 2.5–7 yards long, and 15–30 inches wide, 38-76 cm), which are wrapped around both the baby and the wearer and then tied. There are different carrying positions possible with a wrap, depending on the length of the fabric. A baby or toddler can be carried on the wearer&#x27;s front, back or hip. With shorter wraps it is possible to do a one-shouldered carry, similar to those done with a pouch or a ring sling, although most carries involve the fabric going over both shoulders of the wearer and often around the waist to offer maximum support.

There are two main types of wrap—stretchy and woven. Stretchy wraps are generally made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies in and out of a stretchy wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very stretchy, carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch. Woven wraps are pieces of woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton being the most common, but hemp, linen, silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are homespun or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and jacquards. Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.

=== Simple pieces of cloth ===
Pieces of cloth can be turned into slings by wrapping the fabric around the carrier and the baby and either tying it with knots or using a twist and tuck method to secure the ends. &quot;Rebozos&quot; (Mexico), &quot;mantas&quot; (Peru), &quot;kangas&quot; (Africa) and &quot;selendangs&quot; (Indonesia) are all rectangular pieces of cloth but are tied or wrapped in many different ways. Wraps are also simple pieces of cloth.

=== The podaegi and other Asian-style baby carriers ===
The podaegi (, also spelled podegi) is a Korean carrier with a medium to large rectangle of fabric hanging from a very long strap. Traditionally the rectangle is quilted for warmth and wraps around the mother&#x27;s torso, while the straps are wrapped snug under the baby&#x27;s bottom and tied around to the front to support and secure the baby on the mother&#x27;s back. Western interest in the podaegi style has led to new wrapping methods which do go over the shoulders, and to narrower &quot;blankets&quot;. Variants of this shape include the Iu-Mienh/Hmong carrier and the Chinese bei bei. Iu-Mienh/Hmong carriers and bei beis are both customarily used with over-the-shoulder wrapping and often have stiff sections which help provide head support or block wind.

The Chinese Mei-tai (, Cantonese pronunciation) - meaning mei: to carry on the shoulders / tai: strap, band - is a square or nearly square piece of cloth with parallel unpadded straps emerging from the sides of each corner. It was traditionally secured by bringing all the straps together in a twist with the ends tucked. A variation on the traditional mei tai was popularized in Australia in the 1960s. There are now hundreds of different brands of mei tai available with a variety of features, but the longer straps, taller body and wrap-style tying method are found in almost all of them. Mei tais are suitable for front or back carries with children ranging from birth to as heavy as a parent can support.

Traditional babywearing in Japan was done with a wrap carry, using an obi. In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has long top straps and a rectangular body. But at the bottom of the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while the straps are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body.

Variations of these basic shapes can be found elsewhere in the world. Mei-tai-like carriers were used in places as diverse as Sweden and Africa.

=== Other types of slings and baby carriers ===
Modern structured hip carriers, soft structured carriers (known as SSC) which can be used on front or back, structured front packs and hard-framed backpacks are also used. Hip carriers may be closely related to ring slings or they may be more closely related to a mei tai, and several different types of fasteners are used in different models. Most soft structured carriers are loosely based on the traditional mei tai with a main flat panels and four straps which are shortened and fitted with buckles for added convenience.

== History ==
Traditionally, baby slings and carriers were simply adaptations of whatever a culture normally used to carry anything heavy. Baskets, calabashes, animal skins, and wooden carrying structures have all been adapted to carry infants and children. Korean mothers continue to use Podaegi to carry children. Inuit mothers continue to use the packing parka or amauti to carry children. In the west, this phenomenon has resulted in a variety of carriers based on camping backpacks. One design, used in New Guinea, resembles a small Mayan-style hammock, in which an infant or child is either carried in a net on the back of an adult, or hung on a tree branch or house beam. Historical photographs of indigenous peoples show babies worn in sashes, baskets and nets hung from the parent&#x27;s forehead. Cradleboards and carriers hung from one shoulder like a purse have also been documented in several cultures. 

== Positions ==
A baby can be placed in various positions while being carried in a baby sling or carrier. These include the vertical position, kangaroo carry, front carry, hip carry, and back carry. Cradle hold, previously considered a carry position, has been proven unsafe and unsuitable for use.

== Risks==
There have been incidents of babies suffocating while in carriers, particularly &quot;bag sling&quot; styles, and Consumer Reports urged a recall of all slings of this type in 2009. Consumer Reports recommends soft infant carriers (mei tai or soft structured carriers) and backpack baby carriers over these styles. Advocates argue that other types of slings are safe, especially when the baby&#x27;s face, nose, and mouth are visible at all times.

After a six-week-old baby died while being breastfed &quot;hands-free&quot; in a sling as the mother moved around the house, an inquest heard that the baby was in an unsafe position too far down the sling, and collapsed after five minutes. Despite immediate resuscitation attempts he died three days later. The coroner called for industry standards promoting the safe use of slings, and said that there did not appear to be helpful images, or guidance or advice, of safe and unsafe sling postures. There was no advice that breastfeeding a young baby hands-free risked suffocation.

<text>:For the Louisiana civil rights pioneer, see &quot;E. Edward Jones&quot;.

Edward Ellsworth &quot;Ned&quot; Jones (August 11, 1926 – July 30, 1993) was an influential American social psychologist, he is known as father of Ingratiation due to his major works in the area. He worked at Duke University and from 1977 at Princeton University. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Jones as the 39th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

Along with Keith E. Davis, he is known for developing correspondent inference theory within the field of psychological attribution.

==Biography==
He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Harvard University.

In the classic text &quot;Fundamentals of Social Psychology&quot;, which he co-wrote with Harold B. Gerard and published in 1967, they explain:

Our aim has been to write a systematic presentation of social psychology that emphasizes the experimental approach...Social psychology is a subdiscipline of psychology that especially involves &quot;the scientific study of the behavior of individuals as a function of social stimuli&quot;. This definition seems to say something important and to say it with pedantic precision...By the end of World War II, the way was paved for an outpouring of experimental research involving the manipulation of experimental subjects&#x27; temporary social environment and an examination of the effects of this manipulation on attitudes, behavior, and various emotional states. Questions of behavioral causation could now be examined with closer scrutiny than was possible through questionnaires and interviews. The outlines of an empirical, and especially an experimental, social psychology have clearly emerged.
Jones&#x27;s work is centered on the attribution process, co-developing his &quot;theory of correspondent inferences&quot; with Keith Davis. Jones noted, &quot;I have a candidate for the most robust and repeatable finding in social psychology: the tendency to see behavior as caused by a stable personal disposition of the actor when it can be just as easily explained as a natural response to more than adequate situational pressures.&quot; One of the best-known single papers co-authored with Victor Harris in 1967 tested this theory and led to the development of the fundamental attribution error. He also developed the Actor-observer bias with Richard E. Nisbett.

He focused on the history and the advancement of the field of person perception in order to explore how perceivers and targets interact. One form of interaction that he examined closely resulted in a book on the psychology of ingratiation. In his book on ingratiation, he utilized the models of Goffman, Homans, Thibaut, and Kelley to arrive at the following working definition:
&quot;Combining these contributions, we may conclude that ingratiation is an illegitimate member of the social exchange family because the ingratiator presents himself as a party to one kind of exchange—with one set of terms and conditions—while in fact he is primarily engaged in another kind.&quot;

He further noted the importance of studying ingratiation, writing: &quot;A more valid reason for studying ingratiation is that light might be shed on other common social phenomena such as the antecedents of group cohesiveness, the conditions of social influence and conformity, and the significance of social reinforcement in sequences of social interaction.&quot; He was also an opponent of behaviorism.

In 2004, a book of his selected works was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, edited by former student Daniel Gilbert.

==Notable contributions==

* Work on Fritz Heider&#x27;s &quot;attribution error&quot;, termed &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; by Lee Ross, which is also known as &quot;correspondence bias&quot;. As Gilbert noted, &quot;As geometry was to architecture, so attribution theories were to person perception. Experiments revealed that people&#x27;s attributional inferences looked very much like the attributional inferences that a thinking system would generate if it was relying on formal attributional rules such as the calculus of non-common effects, the covariation and discounting principles and so on. But no one knew whether people were actually using those rules, and if they were, certainly no one knew how.&quot;
* outgroup homogeneity bias
* self-handicapping

<text>&quot;Bésame Mucho&quot; (; &quot;Kiss Me A Lot&quot;) is a bolero song written in 1932 by Mexican songwriter Consuelo Velázquez. It is one of the most popular songs of the 20th century and one of the most important songs in the history of Latin music. It was recognized in 1999 as the most recorded and covered song in Spanish of all time. Famous versions were sung by Trio Los Panchos and female vocalist Gigliola Cinquetti in 1968, and by Dalida in 1976. English lyrics to it were written by Sunny Skylar. It inspired the cult Indian song, Yeh Samaa Samaa Hai Pyar Ka, sung by Lata Mangeshkar in the film Jab Jab Phool Khile.

The song appeared in the film &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (May 5, 1944) when it was played by Charlie Spivak and his Orchestra and in &quot;Cowboy and the Senorita&quot; (May 13, 1944) with vocal by Dale Evans. It was also sung by Chris Isaak in the 2003 movie &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;. 

==Inspiration==
According to Velázquez, she wrote this song even though she had never been kissed yet at the time, and kissing, as she heard, was considered a sin.

She was inspired by the piano piece &quot;Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor&quot;, from the 1911 suite &quot;Goyescas&quot; by Spanish composer Enrique Granados, which he later also included as &quot;Aria of the Nightingale&quot; in his 1916 opera of the same name.

==In politics==

In 1990, a hitherto clandestine affair between two Brazilian government ministers, Bernardo Cabral (Minister of Justice) and Zélia Cardoso de Mello (Minister for Economy, Finance &amp; Planning), was revealed to public knowledge as the couple danced cheek to cheek to &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot; during a birthday party held for Cardoso de Mello. A married father of three, Cabral was forced to resign as a result.

A few days later, at a ceremony in which Cardoso de Mello was due to receive her country&#x27;s Order of Military Merit, the regimental band of the presidential guard, Os Dragões da Independência, struck up &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot; as she was presented with her medal. Its musical director, Lt. Geraldo Mendonça da Lima, was subsequently given 3 days&#x27; detention for insubordination.

==Notable versions==
* Bob Eberly and Kitty Kallen with Jimmy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra (reached number one in the United States in 1944)
* Andy Russell (reached No. 8 in the US in 1944)
* Frank Sinatra had a U.S. top 10 hit in 1954.
* Velázquez herself recorded the song as piano instrumental on her album &quot;Piano Interpretations&quot; (1955).

<doc id="864652" wikidata="Q930053" url="?curid=864652" title="Model Railroader">
<text>Model Railroader (MR) is an American magazine about the hobby of model railroading. Founded in 1934 by Al C. Kalmbach, it is published monthly by Firecrown Media of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Commonly found on newsstands and in libraries, it promotes itself as the oldest magazine of its type in the United States, although it is the long-standing competitor to &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman,&quot; which - originally named &quot;The Model Craftsman&quot; - predates MR by one year.

&quot;MR&quot; is considered to be a general-interest hobby magazine, appealing to a wide range of hobbyists, rather than specializing in a particular scale, or facet of the hobby (such as prototype operations or scratch building and kitbashing). &quot;Model Railroader&quot; covers a variety of scales and modeling techniques for engines, rolling stock, right-of-way, structures, and scenery. It reviews products including ready-to-run models as well as kits, tools and supplies. The magazine presents blueprints and photographs of prototype equipment, as well as photographs of models and layouts.

A longstanding philosophy of modeling is manifest in its editorial features of layout design and operation, in which the model is viewed as a three-dimensional and temporal compression of the real world, so that, for example, the motive power, freight, trackage and scenery of a real-world railroad are formed into a layout which captures the spirit of not only the equipment and region of the railroad but also its purpose and how it operates.

The magazine is published under . Individual issues use the UPC 074820085486.

== History ==
&quot;The Model Railroader&quot; began publication in the summer of 1933, with a cover date of January 1934. A press release announcing the magazine appeared in August 1933, but did not receive much interest. The bank refused to loan Kalmbach any money, many felt sorry for him, and a few told him he was crazy.

His first wife, Bernice, herself a journalist, encouraged and helped Al put &quot;The Model Railroader&quot; together. Though they originally saw it as a sideline business to their commercial printing operations, soon they were devoting seven days a week to the venture.

The magazine was well received by model railroaders, and the young publisher carried the entire first press run (272 copies) by streetcar to be mailed. By July 1934, paid circulation exceeded 1,000 copies. Growth continued, but the magazine was not an immediate success. The magazine became profitable after three years. It took Kalmbach seven years to pay off the loans used to launch the magazine.

World War II introduced paper rationing, which dampened the growth of the Kalmbach Publishing Company. At the end of the war, MR&#x27;s circulation was 18,000. 1949, MR&#x27;s circulation had grown to 82,000. 1950, MR&#x27;s circulation had grown to 104,000, thanks in part to a boom in interest in model railroading. As of 2007, the magazine had a monthly paid circulation of more than 160,000. 2017 the year&#x27;s final issue garnered a reported circulation figure that fell below 100,000.

The magazine, and Kalmbach Publishing (now Kalmbach Media), celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2019.

The magazine had to relocate 4 times, the original location was on 545 S. 84th Street (now a car wash) and later relocated to 1027 N. 7th Street (now part of Milwaukee Public Television and Milwaukee Area Technical College), from 1989 to 2024, they moved to 21027 Crossroads Circle in nearby Waukesha and in 2024, Kalmbach recently sold their building to Silgan Containers and the staff moving to nearby Brookfield, Wisconsin.

Another thing &quot;Model Railroader &quot;had was their own model railroad layout, the Milwaukee, Racine and Troy, which was located on the second floor of the Kalmbach Media offices in Waukesha (the original was located on the 3rd floor of the old offices at 1027 N. 7th Street which was in operation from 1975 to 1989). 

In May 2024, longtime publisher Kalmbach Media divested of Model Railroader and other railroad interest magazines to publisher Firecrown Media. The Milwaukee, Racine and Troy model railroad was demolished when Kalmbach sold their building at 21027 Crossroads Circle and moved to Brookfield, Wisconsin, following the magazine&#x27;s purchase by Firecrown media.

== Features ==

Typical feature articles in each month&#x27;s issue include:
* Layout tours - A layout story with a detailed track plan and behind-the-scenes modeling and construction tips.
* How-to projects - Tips and techniques for modeling scenery, structures, rolling stock, and electronics.
* Prototype information - Detailed drawings historical and technical information on how real railroads and lineside industries function.
* Track plans - Sample designs for model railroads the average hobbyist could build.

Regular monthly columns and departments include:
* News and Products - Quick looks at new products available in the hobby.
* Railway Post Office - Letters from readers.
* Step-by-Step - Tackles a different project each month to help you build a better layout.
* Ask MR - Q&amp;A about prototype railroading and model railroading. Also includes tips by readers. This department was created by merging workshop and Information Desk.
* DCC Corner - Get to know model train operation using Digital Command Control.
* Product reviews - A look at new models on the market and how well they perform.
* Trackside Photos - Inspirational photos featuring the work of fellow hobbyists.
* Trains of Thought - Every month model railroad expert Tony Koester looks at the philosophical side of model railroading.
* On Operation - How to reproduce prototype operations on a model railroad.
* N Scale Insight - From March 2011, former editor Jim Kelly began a column looking at N scale modelling.

== Special issues and other media ==

&quot;Model Railroader&quot; publishes two annual special issues:
* &quot;Great Model Railroads&quot; showcases 10-12 spectacular model railroads, including large, inspirational photographs, detailed track plans, and how-to information.
* &quot;Model Railroad Planning&quot; deals with aspects of designing and constructing a model railroad. Typical articles focus on reproducing prototype track arrangements, overcoming modeling obstacles, and researching prototype railroads.

Other special issues on various aspects of the hobby are released on an irregular basis. Titles have included &quot;102 Track Plans for Model Railroaders,&quot; &quot;How to Build Realistic Layouts,&quot; and &quot;How to Build More Layout in Less Space.&quot;

A bi-monthly web video show, &quot;Modeler&#x27;s Spotlight Video - Inside Cody&#x27;s Office,&quot; is available to magazine subscribers via MR&#x27;s website. The show introduces new products, offers modeling tips, and a viewer mail segment (along with the occasional blooper at the end).

Many of the blueprints, layout plans, articles on operation and signaling, and methods of construction of bridges, structures and scenery are also collected in books published by Kalmbach Books. These are useful to modelers in general, railroad historians, and are valuable references on the steam and diesel eras.

Past MR articles are also collected in PDF form and distributed via the magazine&#x27;s website and available through their digital archive.

&quot;Model Railroader&quot; staff members participated in the production of the &quot;Dream-Plan-Build&quot; video series, which was offered by subscription. The DVDs focused on prototype railroading information, layout visits, and modeling techniques.

&quot;Model Railroader&quot; also produced Model Railroader Video Plus (MRVP) which does layout tours, tips and tricks, and shows like: &quot;Cody&#x27;s Workshop&quot; with Cody Grivno, &quot;Drew&#x27;s Trackside Adventures&quot; with Drew Halverson, &quot;Off The Rails&quot; with Gerry Leone, &quot;Ask MRVP&quot; with David Popp (now called &quot;Ask Trains&quot;), &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Scene&quot; with Kathy Millatt, &quot;It&#x27;s My Railroad&quot; with Steve Brown, &quot;Rehab My Railroad&quot;, &quot;History According to Hediger&quot; with Jim Hediger, &quot;The Hills Line&quot; with James McNabb, &quot;Tuck&#x27;s Toy Trains&quot; with John Truckenbrod and many more. &quot;MRVP&quot; made its debut back in 2013 and is available to magazine subscribers as part of trains.com.

== Cultural impact ==
The model train hobbyists the magazine has profiled over the years include a number of celebrities, including Michael Gross and Rod Stewart.

Model Railroader also has several other &quot;sister&quot; magazines, also published by Kalmbach, including such titles as &quot;Trains magazine&quot;, &quot;Classic Trains,&quot; &quot;Garden Railways,&quot; and &quot;Classic Toy Trains&quot;. They are often advertised in &quot;Model Railroader&quot;, and on occasion, an article will refer to these other magazines.

<doc id="864657" wikidata="Q7406274" url="?curid=864657" title="Saluda Grade">
<text>Saluda Grade was the steepest standard-gauge mainline railway grade in the United States. Owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway as part of its W Line, Saluda Grade in Polk County, North Carolina, gained in elevation in fewer than between Melrose and Saluda, North Carolina. Average grade was 4.24 percent for and maximum was 4.9% for about . In December 2001, Norfolk Southern took the line containing the grade out of service for economic reasons. In a contract signed August 5, 2024, Saluda Grade was sold to the Saluda Grade Trail Conversancy, with plans to convert to a rail trail.

==History==
Captain Charles W. Pearson was assigned to select a route for the Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad (A&amp;SRR) to ascend the Blue Ridge front; the area where the rolling hills of the Piedmont end at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Despite numerous surveys, no route was found for a railroad to traverse the mountains at a tolerable grade; the best route followed the Pacolet River valley and gorge. The line began its climb at the bottom of Melrose Mountain, where Tryon is today, at , and continued on the south side of the Pacolet valley. At Melrose, the Saluda Grade began and climbed to the town of Saluda, cresting in the center of town at an elevation of .
Because of accidents involving downgrade runaway trains in the late 1880s, A&amp;SRR&#x27;s successor, the Southern Railway built two runaway safety spur tracks, which were covered with piles of earth that could stop downgrade runaway trains. These were originally staffed junctions that were always switched to the spurs; only upon hearing a whistle signal from a downgrade train would the signaller staffing a spur junction throw the switch to keep the train on the main line. In later years, CTC signaling was installed along with automated switches and timer circuits for the one remaining runaway safety track at the bottom of the grade at Melrose. Trains running downgrade were required to travel no faster than when approaching the runaway track switch. This would allow a timer circuit to determine if the train was under control, in which case the switch from the runaway track at Melrose would be aligned to the mainline. But for speeds greater than the switch would remain aligned for the runaway track. Saluda Grade was one of the few grades in the country where uphill trains could travel faster than their downhill counterparts. However, most uphill trains had to double or triple the grade, splitting the train into sections to be taken up to Saluda one at a time and reassembled there for the rest of the trip to Asheville.

Norfolk Southern suspended freight traffic between East Flat Rock, North Carolina and Landrum, South Carolina in December 2001, thus ceasing operations on the Saluda Grade. In April 2003, Norfolk Southern severed the line from the rest of its system by placing mounds of dirt over the tracks and disconnecting the rails at mile posts 26 and 45. The signal system was not in use, and grade crossings had their arms removed and signals covered. Norfolk Southern continued to inspect and maintain the right-of-way after placing the segment out of service, removing fallen trees and spraying herbicide on encroaching vegetation, but multiple washouts of the roadbed have occurred between Zirconia and the South Carolina border, rendering the line impassable.

Talks in recent years of a passenger train excursion and a rail-to-trail conversion made no headway. Norfolk Southern stated it did not intend to abandon the line. However, in 2014 Norfolk Southern sold a portion of the W Line south of Asheville between mileposts 1 and 26 to Watco, a Class III shortline railroad operator. Watco operates this segment as the Blue Ridge Southern Railroad. Norfolk Southern still retains ownership of the out-of-service segment over the Saluda Grade.

On July 20, 2022, Upstate Forever announced its desire to turn the portions of the abandoned Saluda Grade into a rail trail. In February 2023, Norfolk Southern agreed to sell 31 miles of the Saluda Grade to another group planning a trail, The Saluda Grade Trail Conservancy. Terms were not disclosed. As of August 2023, &quot;a coalition of three nonprofits is spearheading the Saluda Grade Trail. Conserving Carolina is leading efforts in North Carolina, while PAL: Play. Advocate. Live Well. and Upstate Forever are leading efforts in South Carolina.&quot; On October 3, 2023, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a law funding the acquisition of the corridor from the state line to Zirconia, and it authorized the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to add the corridor to the State Trail System. The contract was signed August 7, 2024.

<text>is a fixed shooter arcade video game released by Konami in Japan in 1982. It was manufactured in North America by Stern Electronics. The player controls &quot;Mama&quot;, a pig whose babies have been kidnapped by a group of wolves.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls Mama Pig, whose babies have been kidnapped by a pack of wolves and who must rescue them using a bow and arrow and slabs of meat. Controls consist of a two-position up/down joystick, which moves an elevator in which Mama Pig rides; and a button, which fires arrows and throws meat.

Each level consists of two rounds. In the first, wolves descend slowly from a high ledge using balloons, which the player must shoot in order to drop them to the ground. Any wolves who reach the ground safely will climb up a set of ladders behind the elevator and try to eat Mama Pig if she moves in front of them. During the second round, the wolves start on the ground and inflate balloons in order to ascend to a cliff on which a boulder is resting so they can push it toward the edge. Airborne wolves throw rocks in both rounds, trying to hit Mama Pig. In addition, the balloon carrying the last &quot;boss&quot; wolf of the second round must be shot several times in order to defeat him; if he reaches the cliff, the player must defeat additional enemies before facing the boss again.

A slab of meat occasionally appears at the top of the elevator&#x27;s range of motion. Picking it up allows the player to throw it, distracting any wolves on/near its trajectory and causing them to let go of their balloons and crash to the ground for bonus points. Stray balloons and dropped fruits can also be shot for extra points.

After every second round, a bonus screen is played. The first such screen requires the player to defeat a group of wolves using only meat, while the second awards points for shooting fruits thrown by the wolves. These two screens alternate after each level.

The player loses one life if Mama Pig is hit by a rock, eaten by a wolf on the ladders (first round only), or crushed by the boulder if too many wolves reach the cliff and push it over the edge (second round only). When all lives are lost, the game ends.

When the game starts, &quot;The Other Day I Met a Bear&quot; can be heard during the opening scene (in which the wolves kidnap Mama&#x27;s babies). The first stage theme bears a very slight resemblance to the main theme music from &quot;Frogger&quot;, another Konami arcade game. The song is a part of the Desecration Rag (An Operatic Nightmare) by Felix Arndt, the portion that mimics the beginning of Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Humoresque Opus 101 Number 7. After the second stage is cleared a second time, a part of &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; can be heard.

==Ports==

Datasoft released &quot;Pooyan&quot; programmed by Scott Spanburg for the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64 and Dragon 32/64 in 1983. It was also ported to the Atari 2600, TRS-80 Color Computer, Sord M5, MSX, Apple II, TRS-80, Tomy Tutor, PV-1000, and Famicom. The arcade version of the game was released as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series in 2019.

==Reception==
&quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited &quot;Pooyan&quot; as a good Atari arcade game.

==Legacy==
&quot;Pooyan&quot; is included on a compilation title &quot;Konami Arcade Classics&quot;, released on the PlayStation and in arcades with the title Konami 80&#x27;s AC Special. An emulated version of the game was released in 2006 for PlayStation 2 in Japan as part of the &quot;Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono&quot;-series.

The Famicom port was released for the Virtual Console in Japan.

Hamster Corporation released the Japanese arcade version of &quot;Pooyan&quot; on Nintendo Switch and PS4 as part of its &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series. The game was released in June 2019 for the Switch in all regions, and for the PS4 in North America and Japan. It was released on July 29 for the PS4 in all other regions. Both the Switch and PS4 versions have on-screen language support for the English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish languages.

There is a series of extra ops in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; known as the &quot;Pooyan Missions&quot;, which involves shooting Fulton surface-to-air recovery balloons carrying abducted soldiers off into the air. Sound effects and music from the arcade game are used throughout the mission.

In 2022, Konami organised a contest encouraging indie developers to make games based on some of its classic series, including &quot;Pooyan&quot;. During the &quot;Konami Action &amp; Shooting Contest&quot; hosted by the Shueisha Game Creator&#x27;s Camp and Tokyo Game Show, Yanagi Bashi won the rights from Konami to develop the game through the competition, and a remake game titled Re:Pooyan is in development.

===Clones===
A largely identical bootleg was sold under the name &quot;Pootan&quot;.

==Highest score==
David Hanzman of Rochester, NY, USA, scored a world record 1,609,250 points on the arcade version of Pooyan on December 16, 1983.

<doc id="864662" wikidata="Q232750" url="?curid=864662" title="Consuelo Velázquez">
<text>Consuelo Velázquez Torres (August 21, 1916, in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco – January 22, 2005, Mexico City), also popularly known as Consuelito Velázquez, was a Mexican concert pianist and composer. She was the composer of famous Mexican ballads such as &quot;Bésame mucho&quot;, &quot;Amar y vivir&quot;, and &quot;Cachito&quot;.

==Beginning Years==
Originally from Ciudad Guzmán, Mexico, she was the youngest of five daughters born to the soldier and poet Isaac Velázquez de Valle and his wife, María de Jesús Torres Ortíz. At four years old she started to demonstrate a good ear and an aptitude for music, and at barely six years old she began studying music and piano at the Academia de Música Serratos in Guadalajara, Mexico. After several years of study, when she was 11, she moved to Mexico City, where she continued her studies and obtained a degree in teaching music and concert piano at the National Conservatory of Music. Her first public concert was held in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the capital, and soon after she began as a composer of popular music. As a concert pianist, she was a soloist of Mexico&#x27;s National Symphony Orchestra and of the Philharmonic Orchestra of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

As performing on the radio for a young woman of a wealthy family was risky, she used a male pseudonym in her first years. Mariano Rivera Conde, who was the artistic director of the station, pushed her to admit she was the author of the songs. Velázquez married him six years later.

== Composer ==
As a composer her legacy has been more well known. Her first compositions, &quot;No me pidas nunca&quot;, &quot;Pasional&quot; and &quot;Déjame quererte&quot;, were from the genre &quot;naturaleza romántica&quot;, which emphasizes nature&#x27;s beauty and strength. Later, songs like &quot;Bésame mucho&quot;, &quot;Amar y vivir&quot;, &quot;Verdad Amarga&quot;, &quot;Franqueza&quot;, &quot;Chiqui&quot;, &quot;Cachito&quot;, &quot;Que seas feliz&quot;, &quot;Enamorada&quot;, &quot;Orgullosa y bonita&quot; and &quot;Yo no fui&quot; (a danceable song initially popularized by Pedro Infante and, in recent years, by Pedro Fernández) emerged among others. Velázquez&#x27;s work as an actress in the 1938 Argentinian movie &quot;Noches de Carnaval&quot; directed by filmmaker Julio Saraceni was unique for her career. As a pianist she was also involved in the Mexican movies directed by Julián Soler &quot;Se le pasó la mano&quot; made in 1952 and &quot;Mis padres se divorcian&quot; made in 1959. Additionally, she appeared in the documentary about her life, &quot;Consuelo Velázquez&quot;, made in 1992. Throughout her life she composed music for several Mexican movies.

== Bésame mucho ==

Her best-known piece is the iconic song &quot;Bésame mucho&quot;, which she composed in the Cuban music genre bolero when she was only 16 years old. This piece gained Velázquez the most recognition and brought the most pleasure to her, and was created before Consuelo received her first kiss from someone she loves. After its recording by the Spanish-Mexican baritone Emilio Tuero, the famous American pianist and singer Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole made the first adaptation of the song in English in 1944. From then on, it was interpreted and performed by hundreds of artists around the world, such as Pedro Infante, Javier Solís, The Beatles, Plácido Domingo, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Luis Mariano (who popularized it France), Dalida, Sonora Santanera, Xavier Cugat and his Orchestra, The Ventures, Antonio Machín, Lucho Gatica, Vera Lynn, Andrea Bocelli, Filippa Giordano, Luis Miguel, Sara Montiel, José Carreras, Ray Conniff and his Orchestra, Diana Krall, Zoé, Susana Zabaleta and Mónica Naranjo among others. &quot;Bésame mucho&quot; is also known as &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Much&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me a Lot&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Again and Again&quot;, &quot;Embrasse-Moi&quot; and &quot;Stále ma bozkávaj&quot;. Translated into more than 20 languages, the song has become an icon of popular music. Part of its great success in the United States was the contextualization of the song towards women who waited for their husbands during World War II.

==Personal life==
Years after the beginning of her career, Velázquez married the media owner and artist promoter Mariano Rivera Conde (died in 1977), and they had two sons, Mariano and Sergio Rivera Velázquez. In the period between 1979 and 1982 she was a part of the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union, which was her only contribution in politics of her country. She was winner of the National Prize for Science and Arts in the field of Popular Art and Traditions in 1989.

=== Death ===
Affected by cardiovascular sickness, Velázquez died on January 22, 2005, at the age of 88. Her body was moved to the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the stage of her first show, in tribute to the known artists of the town. Her ashes later were buried in the Santo Tomas Moro church, where she went every Sunday for mass. As her last artistic contribution, she performed piano in the most recent album of the Mexican singer Cecilia Toussaint titled &quot;Para mi... Consuelo&quot;, which contains songs by Velázquez.

In 1977 the concert pianist also received the Award of Peace of the United Nations, together with her colleague the teacher Ramon Inclan Aguilar and the journalist and singer Wilbert Alonzo Cabrera, Lola Beltrán and Maria Medina. This award was presented to them by the General Clerk of the UN due to this artistic participation and organization of a lavish Mexican festival for the &quot;día del personal&quot; of the United Nations, a day that celebrates the contributions of people in uniform and civilians to the work of the organization.

Recently, it has been discovered that the composer left seven unedited songs in her last wishes, among them &quot;Donde siempre&quot; (dedicated to Cecilia Toussaint), &quot;Mi bello Mazatlán&quot; (that the Banda El Recodo will record) and &quot;Por el camino&quot;, that Velázquez left to the Mexican singer Luis Miguel.

<doc id="864664" wikidata="Q1151504" url="?curid=864664" title="Time Pilot">
<text>is a multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto and released by Konami in 1982. It was distributed in the United States by Centuri, and by Atari Ireland in Europe and the Middle East. While engaging in aerial combat, the player-controlled jet flies across open airspace that scrolls indefinitely in all directions. Each level is themed to a different time period. Home ports for the Atari 2600, MSX, and ColecoVision were released in 1983.

A top-down sequel, &quot;Time Pilot &#x27;84&quot;, was released in arcades in 1984. It drops the time travel motif and instead takes place over a futuristic landscape.

==Gameplay==
Players assume the role of a pilot of a futuristic fighter jet trying to rescue fellow pilots trapped in different time eras. The player&#x27;s jet remains in the center of the screen at all times, and the eight-direction joystick causes their jet to rotate to face in that direction, causing the screen to scroll in that direction to present forward motion.

In each level, players battle many enemy aircraft and the occasional stronger aircraft. After a fixed number of these aircraft are destroyed, as displayed on a bar at the bottom right of the screen, a mothership appears. Once the mothership is defeated, they move onto the next time period. Parachuting pilots will occasionally appear and award players points if collected.

There are five levels: 1910, 1940, 1970, 1982/1983 and 2001. After the fifth level is finished, the game repeats thereafter.

Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 50,000 scored up to 960,000; thereafter, the game goes to &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mode.

Fighters are destroyed if they collide into bullets, enemy ships, bombs or missiles. Game ends when their last fighter is destroyed.

==Development==
According to his account, Yoshiki Okamoto&#x27;s proposal for &quot;Time Pilot&quot; was initially rejected by his boss at Konami, who assigned Okamoto to work on a driving game instead. Okamoto secretly gave instructions to his programmer to work on his idea, while pretending to be working on a driving game in front of his boss.

== Reception ==
In Japan, the annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; chart listed &quot;Time Pilot&quot; as the fifth highest-grossing arcade video game of 1982. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed &quot;Time Pilot&quot; on their June 1, 1983 issue as being the eighteenth most popular arcade title of the month.

In the United States, the game topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade earnings chart in February 1983. The Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) later listed it among the thirteen highest-earning arcade games of 1983.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a generally favorable review upon release.

<doc id="864666" wikidata="Q3539366" url="?curid=864666" title="Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)">
<text>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Trio in A minor, Op. 50, was written in Rome between December 1881 and late January 1882. It is subtitled [In memory of a great artist], in reference to Nikolai Rubinstein, his close friend and mentor, who had died on 23 March 1881. It is scored for piano, violin, and cello.

The work&#x27;s first version was completed by late January 1882. Private performances were held in March and April. The work underwent considerable revision before its premiere on 30 October at a quartet concert of the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. The players at the performance were Sergei Taneyev (piano), Jan Hřímalý (violin), and Wilhelm Fitzenhagen (cello).

==Structure==
The piece is marked by a tragic perspective and is in two movements:

:I. Pezzo elegiaco (Moderato assai – Allegro giusto) (in A minor) (approx 20:00)
:II. (A) Tema con variazioni: Andante con moto (in E major) – (B) Variazione finale e coda (in A major – A minor) (approx 27:00)
Total timing: approx. 47:00

The variations are as follows:
:Var I
:Var II: Più mosso
:Var III: Allegro moderato
:Var IV: L&#x27;istesso tempo (Allegro moderato)
:Var V: L&#x27;istesso tempo
:Var VI: Tempo di Valse
:Var VII: Allegro moderato
:Var VIII: Fuga (Allegro moderato)
:Var IX: Andante flebile, ma non tanto
:Var X: Tempo di mazurka
:Var XI: Moderato
:Variazioni finale e coda: Allegro risoluto e con fuoco
:Coda: Andante con moto – Lugubre (L&#x27;istesso tempo)

The &quot;Pezzo elegiaco&quot; is a darkly brooding and rather conventional romantic first movement with a beautiful opening cello solo with a theme that returns for a final funeral march.

The second movement is rather more unusual: it opens with an almost classical melody, much like Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Rococo Theme&quot; for cello, and then proceeds with an assured set of variations, also like the &quot;Rococo Variations&quot;. After working itself into more and more ecstatic heights culminating with the final variation, it suddenly goes through a surprising modulation to the original minor key, and the theme from the first movement returns with an even greater gravity, and the entire piece concludes with yet another death march.

==Background==
This was the only work Tchaikovsky ever wrote for the combination of piano, violin, and cello. In 1880, his benefactress Nadezhda von Meck, had asked for such a piece, but he refused, saying in his letter to her of 5 November 1880:
You ask why I have never written a trio. Forgive me, dear friend; I would do anything to give you pleasure, but this is beyond me ... I simply cannot endure the combination of piano with violin or cello. To my mind the timbre of these instruments will not blend ... it is torture for me to have to listen to a string trio or a sonata of any kind for piano and strings. To my mind, the piano can be effective in only three situations: alone, in context with the orchestra, or as accompaniment, i.e., the background of a picture.

A year later, he composed the piano trio without being asked to do so, when any number of other genres or instrumental combinations were also available to him.

In a letter to von Meck of 27 December 1881, he again referred to his &quot;antipathy for this combination of instruments&quot;. He wrote: &quot;... in spite of this antipathy, I am thinking of experimenting with this sort of music, which so far I have not touched. I have already written the start of a trio. Whether I shall finish it and whether it will come out successfully I do not know, but I would like very much to bring what I have begun to a successful conclusion ... I won&#x27;t hide from you the great effort of will required to set down my musical ideas in this new and unusual form. But I should like to overcome all these difficulties ...

He completed his rough sketches on 20 January 1882, and completed the scoring by 25 January. On that day he wrote to von Meck again: &quot;The Trio is finished ... now I can say with some conviction that my work is not all bad. But I am afraid, having written all my life for orchestra, and only taken late in life to chamber music, I may have failed to adapt the instrumental combinations to my musical thoughts. In short, I fear I may have arranged music of a symphonic character as a trio, instead of writing directly for the instruments. I have tried to avoid this, but I am not sure whether I have been successful.&quot;

He put the finishing touches to the Trio by 9 February (the score is annotated &quot;Rome 28 January – 9 February 1882&quot;), and sent it to his publishers on 11 February, asking that Sergei Taneyev appear as piano soloist at the first performance. Taneyev, the cellist Wilhelm Fitzenhagen and the violinist Jan Hřímalý were given access to the score, and they made a number of suggestions for improvement, which Tchaikovsky accepted.

A private performance with the above-named soloists was held at the Moscow Conservatory on 23 March, the first anniversary of Nikolai Rubinstein&#x27;s death, while Tchaikovsky was in Italy. He returned to Russia in April and heard the Trio for the first time, at another private performance, after which he made revisions. These included inserting a break before the &quot;Andante&quot; coda and rewriting the piano part in the Finale. Taneyev also rewrote Variation VIII, a change Tchaikovsky approved.

==Notable performances==
The work was performed during Tchaikovsky&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1891, at a reception for the composer at the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C.

==Other uses==
Music from the second movement was used for John Taras&#x27; 1948 ballet &quot;Designs with Strings&quot;.

<text>The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Sources cite at least 118 identified &quot;Egyptian&quot; pyramids. Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt, most were built as tombs for the country&#x27;s pharaohs and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.

The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of Memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others. The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of Djoser built   during the Third Dynasty. This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world&#x27;s oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.

The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built. The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid and the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence, despite being the oldest by about 2,000 years.

==Name==

The name for a pyramid in Egyptian is &quot;myr&quot;, written with the symbol (O24 in the Gardner Sign List). &quot;Myr&quot; is preceded by three other signs used as phonetics. The meaning of &quot;myr&quot; is unclear, as it only self-references the built object itself. By comparison, some similar architectural terms become compound words, such as the word for &#x27;temple&#x27; (&quot;per-ka&quot;) becoming a compound of the words for &#x27;house&#x27; and &#x27;soul&#x27;. By graphical analysis, &quot;myr&quot; uses the same sign, O24, as &quot;benben&quot;. The &quot;benben&quot; is the mound of existence that arose out of the abyss, known as &quot;nun&quot; in the Egyptian creation myth. The relationship between &quot;myr&quot; and &quot;benben&quot; is further linked by the capstone architectural element of pyramids and obelisks, which was named &quot;benbenet&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;benben&quot;.
==Historical development==
Preceded by assumed earlier sites in the Eastern Sahara, tumuli with megalithic monuments developed as early as 4700 BCE in the Saharan region of Niger. Fekri Hassan (2002) indicates that the megalithic monuments in the Saharan region of Niger and the Eastern Sahara may have served as antecedents for the mastabas and pyramids of ancient Egypt. During Predynastic Egypt, tumuli were present at various locations (e.g., Naqada, Helwan).

From the time of the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150–2686 BCE), Egyptians with sufficient means were buried in bench-like structures known as mastabas. At Saqqara, Mastaba 3808, dating from the latter part of the 1st Dynasty, was discovered to contain a large, independently built step-pyramid-like structure enclosed within the outer palace facade mastaba. Archaeological remains and inscriptions suggest there may have been other similar structures dating to this period.

The first historically documented Egyptian pyramid is attributed by Egyptologists to the 3rd Dynasty pharaoh Djoser. Although Egyptologists often credit his vizier Imhotep as its architect, the dynastic Egyptians themselves, contemporaneously or in numerous later dynastic writings about the character, did not credit him with either designing Djoser&#x27;s pyramid or the invention of stone architecture. The Pyramid of Djoser was first built as a square mastaba-like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and was expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers, to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today. Egyptologists believe this design served as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens.

Though other pyramids were attempted in the 3rd Dynasty after Djoser, it was the 4th Dynasty, transitioning from the step pyramid to true pyramid shape, which gave rise to the great pyramids of Meidum, Dahshur, and Giza. The last pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty, Shepseskaf, did not build a pyramid and beginning in the 5th Dynasty; for various reasons, the massive scale and precision of construction decreased significantly leaving these later pyramids smaller, less well-built, and often hastily constructed. By the end of the 6th Dynasty, pyramid building had largely ended and it was not until the Middle Kingdom that large pyramids were built again, though instead of stone, mudbrick was the main construction material.

Long after the end of Egypt&#x27;s own pyramid-building period, a burst of pyramid-building occurred in what is present-day Sudan, after much of Egypt came under the rule of the Kingdom of Kush, which was then based at Napata. Napatan rule, known as the 25th Dynasty, lasted from 750 BCE to 664 BCE. The Meroitic period of Kushite history, when the kingdom was centered on Meroë, (approximately in the period between 300 BCE and 300 CE), experienced a full-blown pyramid-building revival, which saw about 180 Egyptian-inspired indigenous royal pyramid-tombs constructed in the vicinity of the kingdom&#x27;s capital cities.

Al-Aziz Uthman (1171–1198), the second Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt, tried to destroy the Giza pyramid complex. He gave up after only damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too large.

==Pyramid symbolism==

The shape of Egyptian pyramids is thought to represent the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid is also thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was &quot;The Southern Shining Pyramid&quot;, and that of Senusret II at El Lahun was &quot;Senusret Shines&quot;.

While it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them. One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of &quot;resurrection machine.&quot;

The Egyptians believed the dark area of the night sky around which the stars appear to revolve was the physical gateway into the heavens. One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky. This suggests the pyramid may have been designed to serve as a means to magically launch the deceased pharaoh&#x27;s soul directly into the abode of the gods.

All Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the setting sun, was associated with the realm of the dead in Egyptian mythology.

==Number and location of pyramids==
In 1842, Karl Richard Lepsius produced the first modern list of pyramids—now known as the Lepsius list of pyramids—in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. At least 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identified. The location of Pyramid 29 which Lepsius called the &quot;Headless Pyramid&quot;, was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands after Lepsius&#x27;s survey. It was found again only during an archaeological dig conducted in 2008.

Many pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.

The most recent pyramid to be discovered was that of Neith, a wife of Teti.

All of Egypt&#x27;s pyramids, except the small Third Dynasty pyramid at Zawyet el-Maiyitin, are sited on the west bank of the Nile, and most are grouped together in a number of pyramid fields. The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below.

===Abu Rawash===

Abu Rawash is the site of Egypt&#x27;s most northerly pyramid (other than the ruins of Lepsius pyramid number one), the mostly ruined Pyramid of Djedefre, son and successor of Khufu. Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt.

Its location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone. Quarrying, which began in Roman times, has left little apart from about fifteen courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid&#x27;s core. A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.

===Giza===


The Giza Plateau is the location of the Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the &quot;Great Pyramid&quot; and the &quot;Pyramid of Cheops&quot;), the somewhat smaller Pyramid of Khafre (or Chephren), the relatively modest-sized Pyramid of Menkaure (or Mykerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices known as &quot;Queen&#x27;s pyramids&quot;, and the Great Sphinx of Giza. Of the three, only Khafre&#x27;s pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex. This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction—it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume.

The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.

===Zawyet el-Aryan===
This site, halfway between Giza and Abusir, is the location for two unfinished Old Kingdom pyramids. The northern structure&#x27;s owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet. If this attribution is correct, Khaba&#x27;s short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid. Today it stands around high; had it been completed, it is likely to have exceeded .

===Abusir===

There are a total of fourteen pyramids at this site, which served as the main royal necropolis during the Fifth Dynasty. The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty—perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy. They are smaller than their predecessors and are built of low-quality local limestone.

The three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best-preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure. The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre. Most of the major pyramids at Abusir were built using similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mudbricks with a limestone outer casing. The largest of these Fifth Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some high and then later transformed into a &quot;true&quot; pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry.

===Saqqara===

Major pyramids located here include the Pyramid of Djoser—generally identified as the world&#x27;s oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone—the Pyramid of Userkaf, the Pyramid of Teti and the Pyramid of Merikare, dating to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt. Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II. Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser&#x27;s successor Sekhemkhet, known as the Buried Pyramid. Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser&#x27;s.

South of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Djedkare Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi. Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.

The Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors. His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex. It is commonly known as the Mastabat al-Fir’aun.

A previously unknown pyramid was discovered in north Saqqara in late 2008. Believed to be the tomb of Teti&#x27;s mother, it currently stands approximately high, although the original height was closer to .

===Dahshur===

This area is arguably the most important pyramid field in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was inaccessible due to its location within a military base and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.

The southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a &quot;true&quot; smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smooth sides in its finished state, but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone. As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success—albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look. Several kilometres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last—and most successful—of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the world&#x27;s first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid. The structure is also the third-largest pyramid in Egypt, after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza.

Also at Dahshur is one of two pyramids built by Amenemhat III, known as the Black Pyramid, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids.

===Mazghuna===
Located to the south of Dahshur, several mudbrick pyramids were built in this area in the late Middle Kingdom, perhaps for Amenemhat IV and Sobekneferu.

===Lisht===
Two major pyramids are known to have been built at Lisht: those of Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I. The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids. One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat&#x27;s cousin, Khaba II. The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of the ancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty.

===Meidum===
The pyramid at Meidum is one of three constructed during the reign of Sneferu, and is believed by some to have been started by that pharaoh&#x27;s father and predecessor, Huni. However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni&#x27;s name has been found at the site. It was constructed as a step pyramid and then later converted into the first &quot;true&quot; smooth-sided pyramid, when the steps were filled in and an outer casing added. The pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times. Medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps, although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance. The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature, it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way.

===Hawara===

Amenemhat III was the last powerful ruler of the Twelfth Dynasty, and the pyramid he built at Hawara, near the Faiyum, is believed to post-date the so-called &quot;Black Pyramid&quot; built by the same ruler at Dahshur. It is the Hawara pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet&#x27;s final resting place.

===El Lahun===

The Pyramid of Senusret II at El Lahun is the southernmost royal-tomb pyramid structure in Egypt. Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.

===El-Kurru===

Piye, the king of Kush who became the first ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, built a pyramid at El-Kurru. He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.

===Nuri===

Taharqa, a Kushite ruler of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, built his pyramid at Nuri. It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).

===Construction dates and heights===
The following table lays out the chronology of the construction of most of the major pyramids mentioned here. Each pyramid is identified through the pharaoh who ordered it built, his approximate reign, and its location.
==Construction techniques==
Constructing the pyramids involved moving huge quantities of stone. While most blocks came from nearby quarries, special stones were transported on great barges from distant locations, for instance white limestone from Tura and granite from Aswan. 

In 2013, papyri, named Diary of Merer, were discovered at an ancient Egyptian harbor at the Red Sea coast. They are logbooks written over 4,500 years ago by an official with the title &quot;inspector&quot;, who documented the transport of white limestone from the Tura quarries, along the Nile River, to the Great Pyramid of Giza, the tomb of the Pharaoh Khufu.

It is possible that quarried blocks were then transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction. Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together. Workers cut the stones close to the construction site, as indicated by the numerous finds of cutting tools. The finished blocks were placed on the pre-prepared foundations. The foundations were levelled using a rough square level, water trenches and experienced surveyors.

<text>The Lexington Herald-Leader is a newspaper owned by the McClatchy Company and based in Lexington, Kentucky. According to the &quot;1999 Editor &amp; Publisher International Yearbook&quot;, the paid circulation of the &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; is the second largest in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

The newspaper has won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing, and the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning. It had also been a finalist in six other Pulitzer awards in the 22-year period up until its sale in 2006, a record that was unsurpassed by any mid-sized newspaper in the United States during the same time frame.

==History==
The &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; was created by a 1983 merger of the Lexington Herald and the Lexington Leader. The story of the &quot;Herald&quot; begins in 1870 with a paper known as the &quot;Lexington Daily Press&quot;. In 1895, a descendant of that paper was first published as the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, later to be renamed the &quot;Lexington Herald&quot; in 1905. Meanwhile, in 1888 a group of Fayette County Republicans began publication of a competing afternoon paper named the &quot;Kentucky Leader&quot;, which became known as the &quot;Lexington Leader&quot; in 1901.

In 1937, the owner of the &quot;Leader&quot;, John Stoll, purchased the &quot;Herald&quot;. The papers continued as independent entities for 46 years. Despite the common ownership, the two papers had different editorial stances; the &quot;Herald&quot; was moderately liberal while the &quot;Leader&quot; was conservative. The two newspapers published a combined Sunday edition. In 1973, both were purchased by &quot;Knight Newspapers&quot;, which merged with &quot;Ridder Publications&quot; to form Knight Ridder the following year. A decade later, in 1983, the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Leader&quot; merged to form today&#x27;s &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;. In 1985, publisher Creed Black allowed reporters to publish a series of articles which exposed widespread corruption within the University of Kentucky&#x27;s Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team. From 1979 to 1991, the paper was edited by John Carroll, who went on to edit &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

On July 11, 2001, the paper reduced four positions due to declining advertising revenue and higher newsprint costs. Long-time columnists Don Edwards and Dick Burdette took voluntary early retirements but are still published occasionally as contributing writers. The job eliminations were a cumulation of efforts that started in May when the workforce was reduced by 15 positions.

On July 4, 2004, the newspaper, in an effort to apologize for failing to cover the civil rights movement, published a front-page package of stories and archive photos documenting Lexingtonians involved in the movement. The stories, written by Linda B. Blackford and Linda Minch, received international attention, including a story on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It also received an annual professional award by the Kentucky chapter of the Special Libraries Association.

On June 27, 2006, the McClatchy Company purchased Knight Ridder for approximately $4 billion in cash and stock. It also assumed Knight Ridder debt of $2 billion. McClatchy sold 12 Knight Ridder papers, but the &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; was one of 20 retained.
==Office and production plant==
The &quot;Herald-Leader&quot;″s new office and production plant facility was completed in September 1980 at a cost of $23 million. It was a structure that featured 14 Goss Metro offset presses that had the capacity to produce 600,000 newspapers in a typical week.

The plant is on a lot at the corner of East Main Street and Midland. The $23 million cost was divided into $7,804,000 for architecture, $750,000 for interiors and $8,500,000 for production equipment and presses.

In June 2016, it was announced that the &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; would cease its printing operations in Lexington, contracting them out to Gannett from the Louisville facilities for the &quot;Courier Journal&quot;. As a result of the move, 25 full-time and 4 part-time employees would be laid-off. It was also announced that the plant would be put up for sale, with the Fayette County property valuation administrator assessing the property at $6.84 million for tax purposes. The first issue of the Louisville-printed &quot;Herald-Leader&quot; published on August 1, 2016. The last issue of the Lexington Herald-Leader to be printed in Lexington was printed on July 31, 2016. It marked the end of 229 years of newspaper printing in Lexington. In turn, the Louisville facility was shut down in 2021 as part of Gannett&#x27;s own consolidation of its printing facilities, and like the &quot;Courier Journal&quot;, the paper is now printed out-of-state in Tennessee from the &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot;″s facility, meaning that stories and sports scores occurring in the early evening are not within the print edition.

The Herald-Leader building has been proposed as a new city hall for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. Remaining staff will be relocated to a smaller office space upon the sale of the building.

On August 5, 2024, the print edition was reduced to being printed on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, with carrier delivery being discontinued for mail delivery exclusively.

<text>Admiral of the Red James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez (11 March 1757 – 9 October 1836) was a Royal Navy officer known for his victory at the Second Battle of Algeciras.

==Early life==
Saumarez was born at Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, to an old island family, the eldest son of Matthew de Sausmarez (1718–1778) and his second wife Carteret, daughter of James Le Marchant. He was a nephew of Captain Philip Saumarez and John de Sausmarez (1706–1774) of Sausmarez Manor. He was also the elder brother of General Sir Thomas Saumarez (1760–1845), Equerry and Groom of the Chamber to the Duke of Kent, and afterwards Commander-in-Chief of New Brunswick and of Richard Saumarez (1764–1835), a surgeon and medical author. Their sister married Henry Brock, the uncle of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock and Daniel de Lisle Brock. Many of de Sausmarez&#x27;s ancestors had distinguished themselves in the naval service, and he entered it as midshipman at the age of thirteen. Upon joining the Navy, he dropped the second &#x27;s&#x27; to become &quot;de Saumarez&quot;.

==Naval service==

===Early service in the Mediterranean and American Revolutionary War===
In 1767, Saumarez was entered as a volunteer on the books of although he never set foot in the ship, studying at a school near London until in 1770, Saumarez joined the in the Mediterranean. Placed on board , he was rated midshipman in November 1770. A transfer to in February 1772 until she returned to Spithead in 1775 gave an opportunity to take his examination for lieutenant.

In 1775, at the age of 18, Saumarez was ordered to Sir Peter Parker&#x27;s flagship in North America. Saumarez distinguished himself under Parker, showing courage and being promoted to acting lieutenant at the July 1776 Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island which required the &quot;Bristol&quot; to fire broadsides at Fort Sullivan. The engagement lasted 13 hours and 111 men were killed in the &quot;Bristol&quot;.

Saumarez moved to as temporary 5th lieutenant. He received his first command, the tender &quot;Lady Parker&quot;. On promotion to lieutenant in 1778 he received his second command, the 8-gun galley . After forty-seven engagements, unfortunately he had to run &quot;Spitfire&quot; ashore and burn her on 30 July 1778 when a French fleet under Admiral d&#x27;Estaing arrived at Narrangansett Bay. Saumarez then served on land at the Battle of Rhode Island before returning to Portsmouth.

Saumarez next served as third lieutenant in , under various admirals until it became Vice Admiral Hyde Parker&#x27;s flagship, by which time he had moved up to 1st lieutenant. He moved with the Admiral to , in which he was present at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, when he was wounded. He was promoted commander and appointed to the fireship &quot;Tisiphone&quot;. In 1782, Saumarez sailed his ship to the West Indies with despatches for Samuel Hood and arrived in time to witness the closing stages of Hood&#x27;s operations at St Kitts on 25 January 1782.

===Battle of the Saintes===
While commanding (74 guns), Saumarez contributed to Rodney&#x27;s victory over de Grasse at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782. During the battle and on his own initiative, Saumarez took his ship out of line to assist in the capture of de Grasse&#x27;s flagship, . This action prompted Admiral Rodney to remark that, &quot;The &quot;Russell&quot;″s captain is a fine fellow, whoever he is.&quot;

When the war in America was finished, Saumarez went ashore and did not go to sea again until 1793 when he was given command of the frigate , a 36-gun fifth rate frigate.

===Action of 20 October 1793===
It was in &quot;Crescent&quot; that Saumarez was involved in one of the first major single-ship actions of the war when he captured the , in the action of 20 October 1793. British casualties were exceptionally light, with only one man wounded during the engagement. In reward, Saumarez was knighted by King George III and given a presentation plate by the City of London, although he later received a bill for £103 6s 8d (equivalent to £ in ), from a Mr. Cooke for &quot;the honour of a knighthood&quot;. Saumarez refused to pay, telling Cooke to charge whoever had paid for Edward Pellew&#x27;s knighthood after his successful action. Saumarez later wrote to his brother that &quot;I think it hard to pay so much for an honour which my services have been thought to deserve&quot;.
===Channel Islands Station (1794)===

While in command of a Guernsey-based squadron consisting of three frigates, , , and , and some smaller vessels a planned invasion by 20,000 French soldiers of the Channel Islands scheduled for February 1794 was frustrated and cancelled due to Saumarez&#x27;s vigilant eye. On 8 June 1794 on the way from Plymouth to Guernsey, the squadron, which included six smaller vessels, including hired armed lugger and , encountered a superior French force of two razees, three frigates, and a cutter. The French squadron outgunned the British by 192 guns to 92, but Saumarez succeeded in getting his frigates to safety by sailing between rocks on the west coast of Guernsey and around the island to the St Peter Port anchorage. The British luggers and cutters had returned to Plymouth before the start of the action. The British threat to any invasion force stayed intact.

===Battle of Cape St Vincent===
After being promoted in 1795, Saumarez was appointed to the 74-gun in the Channel fleet, where he took part in the defeat of the French fleet at the Battle of Groix off Lorient on 22 June. &quot;Orion&quot; was one of the ships sent to reinforce Sir John Jervis in February 1797, when Saumarez distinguished himself in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. During the early stages he helped repel a sustained attack on the British line and covered the retreat of when she was forced to retire from the action. &quot;Colossus&quot; had sustained serious damage, her sails being virtually shot away and it looked as though she would be raked by Spanish warships, until &quot;Orion&quot; intervened. Later, when the engagement had turned to a general melee, Saumarez forced the &quot;Salvador del Mundo&quot; to surrender before attacking the &quot;Santissima Trinidad&quot; with the help of . Saumarez was certain he had forced her surrender too when the arrival of the remainder of the Spanish fleet forced Jervis to break off the engagement.

===Blockade of Cadiz and the Battle of the Nile===
Saumarez remained with Jervis&#x27;s fleet and was present at the blockade of Cadiz from February 1797 to April 1798. In May 1798, the &quot;Orion&quot; joined the squadron under Nelson&#x27;s command that was sent into the Mediterranean to seek and destroy the French. Saumarez was Nelson&#x27;s second in command at the Battle of the Nile where he distinguished himself once more, forcing the surrender of the &quot;Peuple Souverain&quot; and the 80-gun &quot;Franklin&quot;.

===Battle of Algeciras and Gut of Gibraltar===

On his return from Egypt Saumarez received the command of , of 80 guns, with orders to watch the French fleet off Brest during the winters of 1799 and 1800. In 1801 he was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue, was created a baronet, and received the command of a small squadron which was to watch the movements of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz. Between 6 and 12 July he performed an excellent piece of service in the Algeciras campaign. In the first battle of Algeciras he launched an attack on a French squadron anchored under the protection of shore batteries in Algeciras Bay. Extensive shoals and a fickle breeze hindered his chances of success and HMS &quot;Hannibal&quot; was lost. Where he showed true merit was in refusing to accept this first defeat and in repairing his ships and regrouping for a further attack. When the French squadron, reinforced by Spanish ships sent from Cádiz, made to leave the bay, Saumarez, although substantially outnumbered, went in pursuit. He sent , Captain Richard Keats, ahead and that ship almost singlehandedly brought about the destruction of two Spanish three-deckers and the capture of a French 74 in the Second Battle of Algeciras, also known as Battle of the Gut of Gibraltar. For his services, Saumarez received the Order of the Bath and the Freedom of the City of London. In 1803, the United Kingdom Parliament bestowed upon him an annuity of £1,200 a year (Annuity to Admiral Saumarez Act 1803).

On 30 April, 1802 HMS Ceasar, under his command, made contact with USS Constellation near Gibraltar. During the Peace of Amiens, 1802–3, Saumarez remained at home with his family in Guernsey, and when war broke out again he was given command of the naval forces defending the Channel Islands. He therefore was not present at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. On 23 April 1804 he was promoted to Rear-Admiral of the White.

===Channel Islands Station (1806–08)===
On 9 November 1805 he was advanced to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Red. In 1806 he took command of the Channel Islands squadron on that station for the second time, his flagship was . While in command he was promoted Vice-Admiral in April 1807, his flagship was . He remained in command of the station until February 1808.

===The Baltic Campaign===
In March 1808 Saumarez was given command of the Baltic fleet with his flag in . Saumarez&#x27;s mission was to protect the British trade which was of vital importance for Royal Navy supplies and to blockade enemy ports such as those under French control in northern Germany. The Russian fleet was also kept under blockade until Alexander I reopened Russian ports. On 13 July 1810 he was promoted to the rank of Vice-Admiral of the Red. Sweden, under pressure from France, declared war on Britain in November 1810 but Saumarez showed conspicuous tact towards the government of Sweden and her shipping, correctly guessing that the Swedes, like their Russian neighbours, would eventually defy Napoleon. Charles XIII later bestowed on him the Grand Cross of the military Order of the Sword. Denmark, a French satellite, also needed to be kept under observation until it was invaded by the Swedish Army in 1814. In 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia with half a million troops and Saumarez&#x27;s fleet was instrumental in hampering French operations.

===Latter years and Plymouth Station===

At the Peace of 1814, Saumarez attained the rank of Admiral of the Blue, On 18 July 1819 he was made Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom. On 12 August 1819 he was advanced to the rank of Admiral of the White. On 21 November 1821 he was appointed Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom. From 1824 to 1827 he was Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. On 22 July 1830 he was promoted to the rank of Admiral of the Red. He was raised to the peerage as Baron de Saumarez in 1831 and died in Guernsey in 1836. In memory of Saumarez&#x27;s achievements, there is a statue of him by John Steell in the National Maritime Museum in London. The public bar at the Duke of Normandie Hotel in Saint Peter Port was named after Saumarez and features a portrait of him.

===Relationship with Nelson===
Saumarez and Nelson served together in 1797 and 1798, but their relationship was not a close one. In fact on a number of occasions it became quite strained. They first clashed after the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Saumarez had forced the surrender of the &quot;Santissima Trinidad&quot; but was unable to capture her because Jervis was forced to break off the engagement. Nelson attempted to console Saumarez by telling him that the Spanish had confirmed that the Trinidad had indeed surrendered. Saumarez tersely replied &quot;Whoever doubted it, sir? I hope there is no need for such evidence to establish the truth of a report of a British officer.&quot;

In May 1798, when Saumarez was appointed to Nelson&#x27;s squadron in the Mediterranean, Nelson preferred to confer with Troubridge and even though, as the senior captain, Saumarez was technically second in command, he was often left out of their conversations.

After the Battle of the Nile, while in conversation with Nelson, on the quarterdeck of HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;, Saumarez suggested that the tactic of doubling the French line had been a dangerous one as it exposed British ships to &#x27;friendly fire&#x27;. Before he had a chance to explain, Nelson cut him short and angrily went below. Nelson decided that Saumarez should escort the prizes home, and they never served together again.

Later Nelson wrote a letter saying, &quot;I could have formed no opinion of &quot;Orion&quot; that was not favourable to her gallant and excellent commander [Saumarez] and crew&quot;. However, the awkwardness between them remained.

==Family==

In 1788, Saumarez married Martha le Marchant (d. 1849) of a wealthy Guernsey family, who brought the estate now known as Saumarez Park into the marriage. They had three sons and four daughters: The eldest, James (1789–1863), succeeded to the peerage, was a clergyman and died without children; he was succeeded in the peerage by his brother, John St. Vincent Saumarez (1806–1891).

==Appearances in naval fiction==
Saumarez appears as a minor character in C. S. Forester&#x27;s Hornblower novel &quot;The Happy Return&quot; as a rear-admiral and is mentioned again in the later Hornblower novel &quot;The Commodore&quot; as the admiral soon to be commanding in the Baltic.

Saumarez appears as admiral of the Gibraltar Squadron in &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and also as admiral of the Baltic Fleet in &quot;The Surgeon&#x27;s Mate&quot;, books from Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey–Maturin series.

In &quot;Treachery&quot; (2008) (US title &quot;The Privateer&#x27;s Revenge&quot;) by Julian Stockwin, Saumerez&#x27;s purported orders (actually a forgery) result in the disgrace of Thomas Kydd. Saumarez returns as commander of the Baltic Fleet in &quot;The Baltic Prize&quot; (2017).

<text>The Florida East Coast Railway is a Class II railroad operating in the U.S. state of Florida, currently owned by Grupo México.

Built primarily in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, the FEC was a project of Standard Oil principal Henry Flagler. He originally visited Florida with his first wife, Mary; they sought assistance with the health issues she faced. A key strategist who worked closely with John D. Rockefeller building the Standard Oil Trust, Flagler noted both great potential and a lack of services during his stay at St. Augustine. He subsequently began what amounted to his second career, developing resorts, industries, and communities all along Florida&#x27;s shores abutting the Atlantic Ocean.

The FEC is possibly best known for building the railroad to Key West, completed in 1912. When the FEC&#x27;s line from the mainland to Key West was heavily damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the State of Florida purchased the remaining right-of-way and bridges south of Dade County, and they were rebuilt into road bridges for vehicle traffic and became known as the Overseas Highway. However, a greater and lasting Flagler legacy was the developments along Florida&#x27;s eastern coast.

During the Great Depression, control was purchased by heirs of the du Pont family. After 30 years of fragile financial condition, the FEC, under leadership of a new president, Ed Ball, took on the labor unions. Ball claimed the company could not afford the same costs as larger Class 1 railroads and needed to invest saved funds in its infrastructure, the condition of which was fast becoming a safety issue. The company—using replacement workers—and some of its employees engaged from 1963 until 1977 in one of the longest and more violent labor conflicts of the 20th century. Ultimately, federal authorities had to intervene to stop the violence, which included bombings, shootings and vandalism. However, the courts ruled in the FEC&#x27;s favor with regard to the right to employ strikebreakers. During this time Ball invested heavily in numerous steps to improve the railroad&#x27;s physical plant, and installed various forms of automation. The FEC was the first US railroad to operate two-man train crews, eliminate cabooses, and end all of its passenger services (which were unprofitable) by 1968.

Today, the company&#x27;s primary rail revenues come from its intermodal and rock trains. Brightline, an inter-city rail route, uses FEC tracks between Cocoa and Miami.

The FEC was historically a Class I railroad owned by Florida East Coast Industries (FECI) from 2000 to 2016, FOXX Holdings between 1983 and 2000, and the St. Joe Company prior to 1983.

==History==
===Henry Flagler: developing Florida&#x27;s east coast===

The Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) was developed by Henry Morrison Flagler, an American tycoon, real estate promoter, railroad developer and John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s partner in Standard Oil. Formed at Cleveland, Ohio, as Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler in 1867, Standard Oil moved its headquarters in 1877 to New York City. Flagler and his family relocated there as well. He was joined by Henry H. Rogers, another leader of Standard Oil who also became involved in the development of America&#x27;s railroads, including those on nearby Staten Island, the Union Pacific, and later in West Virginia, where he eventually built the remarkable Virginian Railway to transport coal to Hampton Roads, Virginia.

Flagler&#x27;s non-Standard Oil interests went in a different direction, however, when in 1878, on the advice of his physician, he traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, for the winter with his first wife, Mary, who was quite ill. Two years after she died in 1881, he married Mary&#x27;s former caregiver, Ida Alice Shourds. After their wedding, the couple traveled to St. Augustine, Florida, in 1883. Flagler found the city charming, but the hotel facilities and transportation systems inadequate. He recognized Florida&#x27;s potential to attract out-of-state visitors. Though Flagler remained on the Board of Directors of Standard Oil, he gave up his day-to-day involvement in the firm in order to pursue his Florida interests.

When Flagler returned to Florida, in 1885 he began building a grand St. Augustine hotel, the Ponce de Leon Hotel. Flagler realized that the key to developing Florida was a solid transportation system. At the time, St. Augustine was served by the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Halifax River Railway (JStA&amp;HR), a narrow gauge railway that began service in 1883 between South Jacksonville and St. Augustine. While the JStA&amp;HR was used to transport building materials for the hotel&#x27;s construction, Flagler found it was poorly constructed and its passenger services would be inadequate for patrons to reach his hotel. Flagler joined the board of the JStA&amp;HR on December 10, 1885, before fully purchasing the line three weeks later. Flagler then rehabilitated the line to his standards, purchased new rolling stock, and converting the track to standard gauge. He built a modern depot facility as well as schools, hospitals and churches, systematically revitalizing the largely abandoned historic city.

The Ponce de Leon Hotel opened on January 10, 1888. By April of that year, Flagler acquired a second hotel in St. Augustine, the Casa Monica Hotel, which he renamed Cordova. He then built a third hotel, the Hotel Alcazar, which opened in 1898. With the success of his three St. Augustine hotels, Flagler incorporated the Jacksonville Bridge Company to build a bridge across the St. Johns River and connect the JStA&amp;HR to the rest of Jacksonville&#x27;s railroads. Passengers needed to be ferried across the St. Johns River in Jacksonville to access the line at the time, which was a time-consuming process. Construction began in 1889 and the bridge opened on January 5, 1890, allowing a direct connection for private railcars and Pullman coaches to reach St. Augustine.

By 1888, Flagler was interested in expanding his network beyond St. Augustine. He acquired three additional railroads that year to expand further south. He acquired the St. Johns Railway, which ran from St. Augustine west to the St. Johns River at Tocoi Landing. The St. Johns Railway first opened in 1858 and Flagler purchased the line from New York millionaire William Astor. Flagler also acquired another railroad from Astor, the St. Augustine and Palatka Railway which ran from Tocoi Junction (about halfway between St. Augustine and Tocoi Landing) on the St. Johns Railway and ran southwest to East Palatka. Finally, Flagler acquired the St. Johns and Halifax River Railroad which opened in the early 1880s from East Palatka southeast to Ormond Beach and Daytona. It was extended west into Palatka after the completion of a bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888. In addition to expanding the network, the acquired railroads gave Flagler two additional accesses to the St. Johns River at Tocoi Landing and East Palatka, as well as additional connections to other railroads in Palatka. Continuing to develop hotel facilities to entice northern tourists to visit Florida, Flagler bought and expanded the Ormond Hotel in Ormond Beach.

Flagler created the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company in 1892 as a holding company for his railroad network.

===Expanding further south===

Beginning in 1892, when landowners south of Daytona petitioned him to extend the railroad south, Flagler began laying new railroad tracks; no longer did he follow his traditional practice of purchasing existing railroads and merging them into his growing rail system. Under Florida&#x27;s generous land-grant laws passed in 1893, could be claimed from the state for every mile (1.6 km) built. Flagler would eventually claim in excess of for building his railroad, and land development and trading would become one of his most profitable endeavors. Flagler obtained a charter from the state of Florida authorizing him to build a railroad along the Indian River to Miami, and as the railroad progressed southward, cities such as New Smyrna and Titusville began to develop along the tracks.

The railroad reached Fort Pierce January 29, 1894. By March 22 of the same year, the railroad system reached what is today known as West Palm Beach. Flagler constructed the Royal Poinciana Hotel in Palm Beach overlooking the Lake Worth Lagoon. He also built the Breakers Hotel on the ocean side of Palm Beach, and &quot;Whitehall&quot;, his private 55-room, 60,000 square foot (5,600 m2) winter home. The development of these three structures, coupled with railroad access to them, established Palm Beach as a winter resort for the wealthy members of America&#x27;s Gilded Age.
Palm Beach was to be the terminus of the Flagler railroad, but during 1894 and 1895, severe freezes hit all of Central Florida, whereas the Miami area remained unaffected, causing Flagler to rethink his original decision not to move the railroad south of Palm Beach. The fable that Julia Tuttle, one of two main landowners in the Miami area along with the Brickell family, sent orange blossoms to Flagler to prove to him that Miami, unlike the rest of the state, was unaffected by the frost, is untrue. The truth is that she wired him to advise him that &quot;the region around the shores of Biscayne Bay is untouched by the freezes.&quot; He sent his two lieutenants, James E. Ingraham and Joseph R. Parrott—now famous in Florida history—to investigate; they brought boxes of truck (produce) and citrus back to Flagler, who then wired Tuttle, asking, &quot;Madam, what is it that you propose?&quot; To convince Flagler to continue the railroad to Miami, both Tuttle and William Brickell offered half of their holdings north and south of the Miami River to him. Tuttle added for shops and yards if Flagler would extend his railroad to the shores of Biscayne Bay and build one of his great hotels. An agreement was made and contracts were signed. On September 7, 1895, the name of Flagler&#x27;s system was officially changed from the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company to the Florida East Coast Railway Company and incorporated. The Florida East Coast Railway reached Fort Lauderdale on March 3, 1896. On April 15, 1896, track reached Biscayne Bay, the site of present-day downtown Miami. At the time, it was a small settlement of less than 50 inhabitants. When the town incorporated, on July 28, 1896, its citizens wanted to honor the man responsible for the city&#x27;s development by naming it Flagler. He declined the honor, persuading them to retain its old Indian name, &quot;Miami.&quot; The area was actually previously known as Fort Dallas after the fort built there in 1836 during the Second Seminole War. To further develop the area surrounding the Miami railroad station, Flagler dredged a channel, built streets and The Royal Palm Hotel, instituted the first water and power systems, and financed the town&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

In 1903, Flagler extended the main line an additional 12 miles from Downtown Miami southwest to access much of the unsettled lowlands near Cutler Ridge which he felt could generate agricultural traffic. This proved successful and the following year, the line was extended to Homestead.

===Labor issues===
Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, the fledgling rail empire extensively employed convict labor from largely African-American convicts. While most Southern states employed a form of convict lease at the time, renting prisoners&#x27; labor to various businesses, Florida&#x27;s version of convict lease was considered &quot;especially violent&quot; compared to the others.

According to historian Joe Knetsch, reformers and muckrakers exaggerated charges of peonage regarding construction of the Florida East Coast Railway in 1893 to 1909. Flager and his lawyers defeated all legal challenges and neither the company or its employees were ever convicted in court. However, there were many reports of harsh working conditions and forced indebtedness to the company, and malfeasance by labor agents who hired men for the railway. Knetsch concludes that &quot;Flagler in fact provided health care for his employees and was a far better employer than the press alleged.&quot;

===Key West extension===

Once the railroad reached Homestead in 1904, Flagler then sought perhaps his greatest challenge: the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to Key West, a city of almost 20,000 inhabitants located beyond the end of the Florida peninsula. He became particularly interested in linking Key West to the mainland after the construction of the Panama Canal was announced by the United States in 1905. As the closest deep-water port in the United States to the canal, Key West was positioned to take advantage of significant new trade with the west that would be enabled by the opening of the canalthis, in addition to the city&#x27;s existing involvement with Cuban and Latin American trade. Key West was a major coaling station for ship traffic between South America and New York. Flagler thought it would be profitable for coal to be brought by railroad to Key West for coaling those ships. Though, by the time the extension was finished, the range of ships had been extended to such a degree that they no longer stopped in Key West for coal.
The construction of the Overseas Railroad required many engineering innovations as well as vast amounts of labor and monetary resources. Many considered the Key West extension a folly as it was one of the most daring infrastructure ever built exclusively with private funds. At one time during construction, four thousand men were employed. During the seven years of construction, three hurricanes threatened to halt the project. This included the 1906 Florida Keys hurricane, which killed 135 of Flagler&#x27;s workers.

The Key West extension cost $50 million and the lives of hundreds of workmen. Workers toiled under conditions sufficiently cruel and harsh that the US Justice Department prosecuted the FECR under a federal slave-kidnapping law. Journalists also chronicled conditions of debt peonage wherein immigrant labor was threatened with prohibitive transportation fees to leave Key West after seeing the unsafe and disease-ridden conditions, essentially forcing them to stay.

Despite the hardships, the final link of the Florida East Coast Railway to Trumbo Point in Key West was completed in 1912. The first train, a construction engineers&#x27; train, arrived in Key West on January 21, 1912. The next day, which is considered the first day of service on the new route, a proud Henry Flagler rode the first passenger train into Key West, marking the completion of the railroad&#x27;s oversea connection to Key West and the linkage by railway of the entire east coast of Florida. The completed extension was widely known as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;. Upon his arrival in Key West, Flagler stated &quot;Now I can die in peace&quot; with pride in his achievement. Flagler died 16 months later in May 1913.

==FEC through the years==
===Effect of the Florida land boom and Great Depression===
The Florida East Coast Railway benefitted greatly from the Florida land boom of the 1920s, which led to increased traffic. By 1923, the FEC was running five daily passenger trains roundtrip between Jacksonville and Miami. Two of these trains, the &quot;Havana Special&quot; and the &quot;Key West Express&quot; continued to Key West. The following year, the number of passenger trains between Jacksonville and Miami increased to eight with two continuing to Key West. In response to the land boom, the FEC made investments to their network to increase capacity. Within the decade, FEC built Bowden Yard in Jacksonville and the Miller Shops in St. Augustine. In 1923, the FEC built the Miami Belt Line, a freight route that ran from Little River through Hialeah that reconnected with the main line in Larkin (near Kendall), bypassing downtown Miami. A yard was also built in Hialeah. In 1925, the Moultrie Cutoff was built to shorten the distance between St. Augustine and Bunnell (just north of Ormond Beach) on the main line by bypassing its turn towards Palatka. The main line was also expanded to double track from Jacksonville to Miami in 1926, along with the installation of automatic block signaling. Many of the bridges were rebuilt when the main line was expanded to double track, including the original bridge over the St. Johns River in Jacksonville which was replaced by the current Strauss Trunnion Bascule Bridge. By the end of 1926, the number of passenger trains from Jacksonville to Miami increased to 12, with some continuing to Key West.

Due to the prosperity of South Florida during the land boom, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad brought competition to the region by building a line from Central Florida to West Palm Beach in 1925. This line was extended to Miami and Homestead on a route nearly parallel to the FEC two years later.

The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and Great Depression were harsh on the FEC. The railroad declared bankruptcy and was in receivership by September 1931, 18 years after Flagler&#x27;s death. Bus service began to be substituted for trains on the branches in 1932. Streamliners plied the rails between 1939 and 1963, including &quot;The East Coast Champion&quot; (from New York), &quot;The Florida Special&quot; (from New York), &quot;City of Miami&quot; (from Chicago), &quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; (from Chicago) and &quot;South Wind&quot; (from Chicago), all of which were jointly operated with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

===Labor Day Hurricane of 1935===
The Key West extension was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. An FEC rescue train, with the exception of steam locomotive 447, was overturned by the storm surge at Islamorada. of track were washed away by the hurricane, two miles of which ended up washing ashore on the mainland at Cape Sable. The FEC&#x27;s Long Key Fishing Camp was also destroyed in the storm. Traffic was immediately embargoed south of Florida City after the storm while the Florida East Coast Railway decided whether or not to restore the line.

The Florida East Coast Railway quickly determined that it was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections. The roadbed and remaining bridges south of Florida City were then sold to the state of Florida, which built the Overseas Highway to Key West, using much of the remaining railway infrastructure. A rebuilt Overseas Highway (U.S. Route 1), taking an alignment that closely follows the Overseas Railroad&#x27;s original routing, continues to provide the only highway link to Key West, ending near the southernmost point in the continental United States. The remaining Long Key Viaduct, Seven Mile Bridge, and Bahia Honda Rail Bridge that once carried the Key West extension still stand and are on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Change in ownership===
In the early 1960s, Edward Ball, who controlled the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust, bought a majority ownership of FEC, buying its bonds on the open market, allowing the FEC to emerge from bankruptcy following protracted litigation with a group of the company&#x27;s other bondholders, led by S.A. Lynch and associated with the Atlantic Coast Line which had proposed an alternate plan of reorganization. That same year, a labor contract negotiation turned sour. Ball was determined to save the railroad from the bankruptcy that had continued for more than a decade. Ball was certain that if the company didn&#x27;t become profitable, the equipment and track would deteriorate to the point where some lines would become unsafe or unusable and require partial abandonment. Later, in 1962, the expanded Cuban embargo added to the woes.

===Labor conflict===
Having gained total control of the FEC by 1960, Ball sought to make the railroad profitable again by holding down wages. Despite the recommendation of a National Mediation Board convened by President Kennedy in 1962, Ball refused to grant FEC workers a 10-cents-an-hour raise, accepted by 192 other railroads, claiming that the FEC could not afford to raise wages. This led to a prolonged work stoppage by non-operating unions, beginning January 23, 1963, and whose picket lines were honored by the operating unions (the train crews).

Because the strike was by the non-operating unions, a federal judge ordered the railroad to continue observing their work rules, while the railroad was free to change the work rules for the operating unions, who were technically not on strike and thus had no standing in the federal court regarding the strike.

Ball&#x27;s use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings; a number of freight trains were derailed or blown up. Eventually, federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad&#x27;s right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. The FEC continued operation with heavily reduced non-union crews (often former strikers), at the cost of a high turnover rate, low morale, and deteriorating infrastructure.

Most of the unions struck an agreement with the FEC in 1971; the United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers remained on strike until March 1, 1974, until the courts forced a settlement. According to historian Burton Altman:
After the settlement, workers were earning at least one dollar an hour less than their counterparts on other railroads. Wages were well below the industry&#x27;s scale and the work force had been cut in half. When the strike began, 1,600 walked out. In time, 900 went back to work on the company&#x27;s terms; others found employment elsewhere. Only about 100 stayed out until the end, and many of them could not return to work because they could no longer pass the required physical examinations or were too old to work. The end of the strike also ended their meager benefits that had enabled members to survive.
After Ball&#x27;s death in 1981, Raymond Wyckoff took the helm of the company on May 30, 1984.

===Strike&#x27;s impacts on passenger service===
From the beginning of the strike, the long-distance named passenger trains rerouted over an Atlantic Coast Line Railroad route through the central interior of the peninsula south from Jacksonville to Auburndale, and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad route south from Auburndale completed the trip to West Palm Beach and Miami. The strike and the resulting interior rerouting marked the end of long-distance coastal service between Jacksonville and West Palm Beach. Any resumed service later, in 1965, was strictly intrastate trains operated by the FEC.

Passenger service became a political issue in Florida during the early years of the labor strike, which essentially lasted 14 years, from 1963 to 1977. At the insistence of the City of Miami—which had long fought to get rid of the tracks in the downtown section just north of the county courthouse—Miami&#x27;s wooden-constructed downtown passenger terminal was demolished by November 1963. Although a new station was planned at NE 36th Street and NE 2nd Avenue, it was never built.

Further, while freight trains were operated with non-union and supervisory crews, passenger runs were not reinstated until August 2, 1965, after the City of Miami sued and the Florida courts ruled that the FEC corporate charter required both coach and first class passenger services to be offered. In response, FEC sold &quot;parlor car seating&quot; for first class accommodations in the rear lounge section of a tavern-lounge-observation car. Train service operated daily, except Sunday. This new state-mandated passenger service consisted of a single diesel locomotive and two streamlined passenger cars, which, in addition to the operating crew, were staffed by a passenger service agent and a coach attendant, who were &quot;non-operating&quot;. The mini-streamliner operated all of the way across three previously observed crew districts (Jacksonville to New Smyrna Beach to Fort Pierce to Miami). Following the letter of the law, the passenger service was bare bones. The trains carried no baggage, remains, mail or express and honored no inter-line tickets or passes. The only food service was a box lunch (at Cocoa-Rockledge in 1966). On-board beverage service was limited to soft drinks and coffee. Without a station in Miami, the 1950s-era station in North Miami became the southern terminus. This stripped-down service operated six days a week until it was finally discontinued on July 31, 1968.

==FEC in the 21st century==

===Routing===
The Florida East Coast Railway has operated from its relocated headquarters in Jacksonville since it sold the original General Office Building in St. Augustine to Flagler College in late 2006. Its trains run over nearly the same route developed by Henry Flagler, with the addition of the Moultrie Cutoff (St. Augustine to Bunnell), which was built in 1925 to shorten the main line south of St. Augustine.

===Leadership===
In March 2005, Robert Anestis stepped down as CEO of Florida East Coast Industries after a four-year stint, allowing Adolfo Henriquez to assume that position, with John D. McPherson, a long-time railroad man, continuing as president of the railway itself. By this time, the railroad had long since made peace with its workers.

In late 2007, in a move surprising to many employees and railroad industry observers alike, the FEC was purchased for over US$3 billion (including non-rail assets) by Fortress Investment Group, the principal investors who also control short line railroad operator RailAmerica. John Giles was named chairman, and David Rohal was named president. Both men were also principals with major responsibilities at RailAmerica as well, although the ownership of FEC and RailAmerica were not linked corporately, and the spinoff of RailAmerica as a publicly traded company did not include FEC.

In May 2010, James Hertwig was named as president and chief executive officer of the company effective July 1, 2010. Hertwig had recently retired from CSX, most recently having served as president of CSX Intermodal, one of CSX&#x27;s major operating units.

James Hertwig retired as president and chief executive officer of the company effective December 31, 2017, and was replaced by Nathan Asplund as the railway was purchased by Grupo México and now manages it along with its other transport interests.

===Operations===
The FEC operations today are dominated by &quot;intermodal&quot; trains and unit rock (limestone) trains. Passenger service was discontinued in 1968 after labor unrest but later resumed (under a different operator) with the introduction of Brightline in 2018.

The company&#x27;s major income-earning sources are its rock trains, transporting primarily limestone, and intermodal trains. FEC freight trains operate on precise schedules. Trains are not held for missed connections or late loadings. Most of the trains are paired so that they leave simultaneously from their starting points and meet halfway through the run and swap crews, so they are back home at the end of their runs. The FEC pioneered operation with 2 man crews with no crew districts, which they were able to start doing after the 1963 strike. The entire railroad adopted automatic train control (ATC) after a fatal 1987 collision caused by a crew not obeying signaling. .

FEC has what is called by some a &quot;prime&quot; railroad right-of-way. The heavy weight of the rock trains required very good trackage and bridges. The railroad has mostly 136 pound-per-yard (66 kg/m) continuous-welded rail attached to concrete ties, which sits on a high quality granite roadbed. The entire railroad is controlled by centralized traffic control with constant radio communication. Because the railroad has only minor grades, it takes very little horsepower to pull very long trains at speed. trains are a normal FEC operating standard.

====Passenger service====
The FEC was already in the freight-only business when Amtrak was created and assumed passenger operations of nearly all U.S. railroads&#x27; passenger services in 1971. Periodically, there has been speculation that the southern end of the FEC line might be used for a commuter rail service to complement the existing Tri-Rail line (which follows former CSX tracks to the west). There has also been some discussion about Amtrak or the State of Florida using FEC lines for a more direct route between Jacksonville and Miami. The company has more recently indicated that it is open to allowing commuter rail services along its lines, with potential service areas in Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Jacksonville&#x27;s First Coast Commuter Rail.

In March 2012 FEC Industries (not FEC Railway) proposed a privately owned and operated service between Miami and Orlando along its route, to be named &quot;All Aboard Florida.&quot; New high speed trackage would be built between Brevard County (the oceanside county east of Orlando) and Orlando International Airport. In addition to the new track, the main line is once again being expanded to double track from Brevard County to Miami (some of the bridges still have adequate width from the previous double track). In 2014 the very first beginnings of All Aboard Florida commenced with studies and actual construction of the first phase, and construction began in November 2014. In 2015, AAF announced they would operate the service under the name &quot;Brightline.&quot; Since 2018, Brightline has had service on an initial stretch between West Palm Beach and Miami, with a station in Fort Lauderdale in between. In 2022, two additional stations in Boca Raton and Aventura were added. A new railway extension to Orlando International Airport started service in 2023, and a future rail expansion to Tampa is currently in the planning stages.

====Rock trains====
A lifeblood of the FEC is its transportation of high-grade limestone, which is used in the formulation for concrete and other construction purposes. The limestone is quarried near Miami in the &quot;Lake Belt&quot; area of Dade County and Broward County just west of Hialeah. The rock trains come out of the FEC yard at Medley in Miami-Dade County and the southern end of the FEC service area. Shipments currently are principally for materials dealers Titan and Rinker.

Rinker has since been sold and is now part of the multi-national Cemex. Rock train traffic dropped dramatically in 2008 with the elimination of all but one dedicated rock train. Other rock loads are now added onto other regular trains. Up until mid 2017, only one rock train remained, which is called the &quot;unit train&quot; and operates between Miami and City Point. Since then, rock traffic has rebounded, and the railroad has since added a second unit rock train which handles Ft. Pierce bound rock.

====Intermodal services====
The intermodal traffic includes interchanged shipments with CSX and Norfolk Southern, participation in EMP container service operated by UP and Norfolk Southern, United Parcel Service (UPS) piggyback trailers, trailers going to the Wal-Mart distribution center at Fort Pierce, and intermodal shipping container traffic through the ports of Miami, Port Everglades (adjacent to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and the principal source of imports), Port of Palm Beach/Lake Worth Inlet, and Port Canaveral.

Additionally FEC offers &quot;Hurricane Service&quot; offering trucking companies the opportunity of having their trailers piggybacked out of Jacksonville to save the expensive cost of back-hauling empty trailers.

Starting in 2012 the FEC began an aggressive project to reopen direct rail service to the ports of Miami, and Port Everglades. This is in anticipation of the expansion of the Panama Canal and the expected increase of intermodal traffic. In 2013 the drawbridge at the Port of Miami was repaired and reactivated and trains began to roll. In 2014 a new container shuttle was put into operation between Hialeah Yard and the Port of Miami. Also in 2014, the new rail lines into Port Everglades were opened, allowing direct access for FEC trains into the port. Further, a new transfer facility in Hialeah Yard will add additional intermodal transfer between trains, trucks, and planes. This facility opened in 2015. Additional capacity improvements are planned at other ports as well as the FEC&#x27;s mainline.

====Other freight====

The FEC also hauls normal &quot;manifest&quot; freight to and from points along its right of way. These cars are hauled on whatever train is going that way, so intermodal and rock trains routinely have some manifest cars in their consists.

Additionally, the FEC currently transports Tropicana Products &quot;Juice Train&quot; cars to and from one of the company&#x27;s processing facilities located on the &quot;K&quot; Line. The Juice Train concept was developed by Tropicana founder Anthony T. Rossi in conjunction with Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (a CSX predecessor) beginning in 1970.

====Motive power====
The FEC completed its &quot;second generation&quot; dieselization with the purchase of 49 GP40s and GP40-2s and 11 GP38-2s, ranging in the 400&#x27;s. Most of these locomotives were extensively rebuilt, with others being retired. In 2002, the FEC acquired 20 ex-UP SD40-2s, which were numbered in the 700s. These ex-UP locomotives remained in their original colors with FEC markings; however, as of 2014 seven of them had been repainted into the &quot;retro&quot; Champion scheme. As of 2015 most of these were leased to CSXT.

In 2006 the FEC leased four SD70M-2&#x27;s numbered in the 100 series (100-103), in a blue and yellow livery known by fans as the &quot;Classic&quot; or the &quot;Alaskan&quot; schemes. In 2009 when RailAmerica came into the picture, they added four more SD70M-2&#x27;s (104-107) in the red, pearl, and blue scheme, which was the standard RailAmerica scheme. That brought the total SD70M-2 count to eight.

Seeking further power improvements, in 2009, the FEC leased three CITX SD70M-2&#x27;s, making the count now of 11 of the big EMD&#x27;s. These locomotives were numbered 140, 141 and 142; all were blue and white striped units. All of the SD70M-2&#x27;s served on the railway until the end of 2014, when they were replaced with new power. The fleet GP38-2s were used principally for yard and road switching as well as the occasional local. The others were used as available in road service. Some test runs were made to observe the effect on fuel consumption of dynamic braking and combinations of new and old power.

In 2014 the railway purchased 24 GE ES44C4s, its first General Electric and AC powered locomotives. All of the GE&#x27;s were delivered by the end of 2014, with the first arriving on November 21, 2014. In 2015 the railway began to experiment with LNG fuel that will help with costs and efficiency. With the arrival of the GE&#x27;s the majority of the FEC&#x27;s SD40-2&#x27;s and a number of the SD70M-2&#x27;s were temporarily leased to CSXT. As of year end 2017, all SD70M-2&#x27;s had been returned to their respective leasing companies. Most of the SD40-2&#x27;s remained on the FEC with the exception of leases to other companies.

=====LNG fuel=====
FEC is the only US railroad actively using liquefied natural gas, a much cleaner fuel than diesel, to power its 24 dual fuel GE ES44C4 locomotives. The locomotives are used in pairs with an LNG fuel tender between them.

===Statistics===
In 1925 FEC carried 979 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 261 million passenger miles on (at year-end) 849 miles of road and 1411 miles of track; corresponding numbers for 1970 were 1345, 0, 554 and 1058.

In 2005 FEC owned and operated:
* of mainline track between Jacksonville and Miami, Florida
* of branch, switching, and other secondary track
* of yard track

Flagler Development owned and operated:
* 64 buildings
* 7.4 million rentable square feet

==Awards and recognition==
On May 16, 2006, FEC was the recipient of the Gold E. H. Harriman Award for safety in Group C (line-haul railroad companies with fewer than 4 million employee hours per year).

==Corporate history==

The Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway Company was incorporated under the general incorporation laws of Florida to own and operate a railroad from Jacksonville in Duval county, through the counties of Duval, St. Johns, Putnam, Volusia, Brevard, Orange, Osceola, Dade, Polk and Hillsborough.

Florida state law chapter 4260, approved May 31, 1893, granted land to the railroad. At that time, it was already in operation from Jacksonville to Rockledge, the part south of Daytona having been constructed by them. The company had just filed a certificate changing and extending its lines on and across the Florida Keys to Key West in Monroe County.

The name was changed to the Florida East Coast Railway Company on September 7, 1895.

Florida East Coast Industries (FECI) incorporated in 1983 and was made the holding company for the Railway and the Commercial Realty/Flagler Development Company in 1984. The other subsidiaries are Orlando-based carrier, &quot;EPIK Communication&quot; and the logistics firm, &quot;International Transit&quot;.

FECI began operating independently of the St. Joe Company on October 9, 2000 when St. Joe shareholders were given FECI stock.

On May 8, 2007, Florida East Coast Railway Company&#x27;s parent, FECI, announced that FECI would be purchased with private equity funds managed by Fortress Investment Group in a transaction valued at $3.5 billion. Fortress Investment acquired Florida East Coast Railway from Florida East Coast Industries in March 2008.

On July 7, 2017, Grupo México Transportes, subsidiary of Grupo México, completed the acquisition of Florida East Coast Railway. FECI retained their passenger trackage rights, which are now used for Brightline.

==Lines==
===Main line===
At its greatest extent, Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s Main Line ran from Jacksonville via Miami to Key West, a distance of over 500 miles. Today, the Main Line continues to run from Jacksonville to Miami.

Prior to 1925, the main line deviated from its current route between St. Augustine and Bunnell. From St. Augustine, it ran southwest to East Palatka on the St. Johns River before turning back southeast to Bunnell. In 1925, the Moultrie Cutoff was built to reroute the main line on to a more direct route from St. Augustine to Bunnell, bypassing the inland swing to East Palatka. The original main line remained in service after the Moultrie Cutoff was complete, but it was downgraded to branch status (Palatka Branch) and is now mostly abandoned. The milepost numbers on the main line still reflect the original route, causing the mileposts to abruptly jump from 67 to 86.4 in Bunnell today.

In 1926, the main line was double-tracked between Jacksonville and Miami in response to the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Bridges were rebuilt and Automatic Block Signals were also installed at the same time.

The Key West Extension was destroyed by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and was not rebuilt with Florida City subsequently becoming the new southern terminus. The Overseas Highway (US 1) largely runs along the former Key West Extension right of way today.

In 1972, four years after the discontinuation of FEC&#x27;s passenger services, work began to restore the main line to single track with passing sidings every 10 miles and Centralized traffic control. Also in 1972, FEC abandoned the main line from Miami south to Kendall, which included the demolition of the swing bridge over the Miami River in downtown Miami. The FEC sold the right of way of this abandoned segment to Miami-Dade Transit in 1979, who then built the southern half of Miami&#x27;s Metrorail on the former right of way. Main line track from Kendall to Florida City remained in service at this time since it could still be accessed through the Little River Branch. By 1989, the remaining main line track from Kendall to Florida City (which had been the southern terminus since the abandonment of the Key West Extension in 1935) was abandoned. Today, the South Miami Dade Busway and South Dade Rail Trail run on the former right of way from Kendall to Florida City.

With the reintroduction of passenger service on the FEC via Brightline in the 2010s, most of the main line has once again been expanded to double track. Double track from Miami to West Palm Beach was completed in late 2017. Double track from West Palm Beach to Titusville has been completed as part of Brightline&#x27;s second phase. Many bridges have been rebuilt along this segment as part of the project, despite the fact that many of the older bridges still have adequate width from the previous double track.

===Kissimmee Valley Line===
The Kissimmee Valley Line, also known as the Okeechobee Branch, ran from just south of New Smyrna Beach through the Kissimmee Valley roughly paralleling the main line.  Branching off the Main Line at Edgewater, it headed southwest to Maytown, where it crossed the Enterprise Branch.  From Maytown, it turned south and headed through largely rural agricultural land to Okeechobee, a small town on the north side of Lake Okeechobee. South of Holopaw, the line roughly parallels US 441.

Construction began at Maytown on February 25, 1911, and was completed to Okeechobee in 1915. The line was extended north from Maytown to Edgewater (just south of New Smyrna Beach) in 1916 to have its own connection to the Main Line.

By 1923, the branch was extended from Okeechobee southeast and around the eastern side of Lake Okeechobee to Belle Glade. The Interstate Commerce Commission had authorized the FEC to extend the line as far as Hialeah to connect with the South Florida network, but it was never built south of Belle Glade. The line was instead extended from Belle Glade west to South Bay and Lake Harbor on the south side of the lake at the Miami Canal in 1929.  Here, it connected with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s Haines City Branch.

In 1947, the Kissimmee Valley Line was abandoned from Maytown to Marcy since it ended up not generating the agricultural traffic it had hoped to.  At the same time, the remaining line south of Marcy to Lake Harbor was connected to the Main Line at Fort Pierce and is now part of the Lake Harbor Branch.

===Lake Harbor Branch===

The Lake Harbor Branch (K Branch) runs from Fort Pierce in St. Lucie County to Lake Harbor in Palm Beach County. It basically serves the sugar farms in Palm Beach and Hendry Counties. It branches off the main line in Fort Pierce and heads southwest to Marcy, where it turns south along Lake Okeechobee. At Lake Harbor, it connects to the South Central Florida Express&#x27;s main line (a former CSX branch). South Central Florida Express began leasing the line from FEC in 1998 and now fully operates the line from milepost K 15 south. FEC serves local customers on the line from milepost K 15 north, with South Central Florida Express having trackage rights from there into Fort Pierce Yard on the main line. They also have a car haulage arrangement with FEC to Jacksonville to interchange with CSX and Norfolk Southern.

The Lake Harbor Branch was originally built in the 1920s and was the southernmost segment of the Kissimmee Valley Line until 1947, when the Glades Cutoff from Marcy to Fort Pierce was built and the rest of the Kissimmee Valley Line to the north was abandoned.

===Little River Branch (Miami Belt Line)===
The Little River Branch connects to the main line near Little River and heads south west toward Hialeah, where it turns south towards Hialeah Yard and Miami International Airport. The line sees significant freight traffic since Hialeah Yard has been FEC&#x27;s main yard for the Miami area since the closure of Buena Vista Yard on the main line. The branch currently ends just south of the airport at Oleander Junction, where it connects with CSX&#x27;s Homestead Subdivision and the South Florida Rail Corridor. An industrial spur also runs northwest from the line near Medley. The line was realigned in the 1980s to accommodate the extension of Runway 9/27 at Miami International Airport.

Built in 1923, the Little River Branch (also known as the Miami Belt Line) was historically a freight bypass around downtown Miami when the FEC main line continued south to Homestead and Florida City. The branch continued south past its current terminus at the airport and reconnected with the main line at Larkin, just north of Kendall. The line was double-tracked north of Hialeah Yard in 1925. When construction of the line was authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1923, the line from Little River to Hialeah was intended to be part of the extension of the Kissimmee Valley Line with track south to Larkin authorized as a branch line. The southern extension of the Kissimmee Valley Line was never built.

The branch was abandoned south of Oleander Junction in 2002. This abandoned segment is currently planned to become the Ludlam Trail linear park.

===Palm Beach Branch===
The Palm Beach branch was built to serve Flagler&#x27;s hotels on Palm Beach island. When first built in 1895, the Palm Beach Branch ran from the main line east through West Palm Beach between Banyan Boulevard and Second Street (known then as Althea Street). It crossed the Lake Worth Lagoon and on to Palm Beach Island just south of Flagler&#x27;s Royal Poinciana Hotel. The branch had passenger stations at both the Royal Poinciana and The Breakers, Flagler&#x27;s other hotel on Palm Beach Island. The original branch was essentially the end of the FEC before the main line was extended south to Miami in 1896.

In 1902, Flagler&#x27;s built his estate Whitehall for his wife Mary. Whitehall was across the branch&#x27;s tracks from the Royal Poinciana Hotel. The estate&#x27;s proximity to the branch prompted Mary to complain about the noise and smoke coming from trains at Whitehall. In response, Flagler promptly had the branch removed and relocated with a new trestle over Lake Worth Lagoon four blocks north. The branch then connected to the hotels on their north side and the bridge also included a pedestrian walkway for hotel patrons. The branch would remain service until 1935 when it was abandoned, a year after the closure of the Royal Poinciana Hotel.

After its removal, the former trestle became a toll bridge, which was replaced by the Flagler Memorial Bridge in 1938 (which carried State Road A1A until 2017 when a new bridge replaced the 1938 span). Much of the former right of way of this branch is still owned by the Town of Palm Beach.

===Palatka Branch===
The Palatka Branch (P Branch) ran from Moultrie Junction (just outside of St. Augustine) southwest to East Palatka before turning back southeast and reconnecting with the main line at Bunnell. There was also a spur with a bridge across the St. Johns River into Palatka, where there was a junction with the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway and the Florida Southern Railway (which would both become part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad&#x27;s network).

The Palatka Branch was built by predecessors St. Johns Railway, the St. Augustine and Palatka Railway, and the St. Johns and Halifax River Railroad which all became the Florida East Coast Railway in 1895. The line was the Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s main line until the construction of the Moultrie Cutoff in 1925. After the completion of the Moultrie Cutoff between St. Augustine and Bunnell, the original main line though East Palatka remained in service and became the Palatka Branch.

The connection to Palatka and the bridge over the St. Johns River was removed in 1950, and track from East Palatka to Bunnell was abandoned in 1972. In 1983, track was abandoned from East Palatka to Hastings. The rest of the branch from Hastings was later abandoned in 1988 and all rail was removed to a point just west of I-95 near Vermont Heights. In 2001, rail service resumed up to this point and track was rehabilitated when new industries were located there. A daily local serves the eastern end of the line today known as the Wilber Wright Industrial Lead. Some of the right-of-way is now the Palatka-to-St. Augustine State Trail.

===Enterprise Branch===
The former Enterprise Branch (E Branch) was built in 1885 by the Atlantic Coast, St. Johns and Indian River Railroad and leased to the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad (JT&amp;KW), one of the Plant System railroads. Initially, the westernmost five miles (8 km) served as a connection from the JT&amp;KW main line at Benson Junction (known then as Enterprise Junction) to Enterprise, a port for steamboat traffic down the St. Johns River. Later, the line was extended southeast from Enterprise through Osteen, Kalamazoo, and Mims to Titusville. In Titusville, it connected to the St. Johns and Halifax River Railway, which would become the Florida East Coast Railway main line. The Enterprise Branch would also cross the Kissimmee Valley Line at Maytown, which was built in 1911.

A steam locomotive pulled the first train over the line onto the wharf on the Indian River at Titusville on the afternoon of December 30, 1885, and greatly accelerated the transportation of passengers, produce, seafood, and supplies to and from central Florida. While Titusville thrived thanks to this new transportation connection, Enterprise lost stature as a steamboat port, since Henry Plant&#x27;s railroad paralleled the St. Johns River and greatly reduced travel times to Jacksonville.

During the winter of 1894–95, a widespread freeze hit twice, decimating the citrus crop and ruining that part of Florida&#x27;s economy. This allowed Henry Flagler to acquire the line at a discount to piece together what became the Florida East Coast Railway.

The track of the E Branch was removed from Benson Junction to Aurantia in 1972, ending directly under the Interstate 95 overpass. The crossing gates and signals between Titusville and Aurantia were removed before the summer 2004 hurricanes and track was later removed by a steel salvage company. By 2008, all remaining track of the E Branch had been removed.

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection took ownership of the rail bed on December 31, 2007. East Central Regional Rail Trail and the Florida Coast to Coast Trail now run along the former right of way.

===Cape Canaveral Branch===

In 1963, FEC built a branch from the main line from just north of Titusville east to Cape Canaveral. The branch included a causeway and drawbridge over the Indian River and ran to a point known as Wilson&#x27;s Corner. The branch was built to serve the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and what would become Kennedy Space Center.

FEC built two yards along the branch: Jay Jay Yard at the junction with the FEC main line, and Wilson Yard at Wilson&#x27;s Corner. The US Army Corps of Engineers then built the NASA Railroad beyond Wilson&#x27;s Corner with a line to the Vehicle Assembly Building and another line to the launch pads. The FEC would use the branch to deliver equipment to NASA for the Apollo program.

In 1984, FEC sold its portion of the branch to the NASA Railroad. The NASA Railroad has since been used to deliver segments of the Solid rocket boosters for the Space Shuttle and the Artemis program.

===Ormond Beach Branch===
The Ormond Beach Branch was a short branch that ran from the main line in Ormond Beach. It ran east from the main line over the Halifax River to the Ormond Hotel, which opened in 1888. Flagler acquired the Ormond Hotel in 1888 and expanded it to 600 rooms. The Ormond Beach Branch was built by the Ormond Bridge Company as a branch of the St. Johns and Halifax River Railroad (the original builder of the main line from East Palatka to Daytona) in 1887. The branch would also run past The Casements, which would be the winter home of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil and Flagler&#x27;s former business partner. The Ormond Beach Branch was abandoned in 1932.

===Fellsmere Branch===
The former Fellsmere Branch ran from the main line at Sebastian west to Fellsmere. It was originally built by the Sebastian &amp; Cincinnatus Railroad in 1896. In 1909, it was run by the Fellsmere Farms Company. In 1924, the line was taken over by the Trans-Florida Central Railroad. It was abandoned in 1952.

===Orange City Branch===
The former Orange City Branch (also known as the Atlantic and Western Branch) ran from New Smyrna Beach west to Orange City and Blue Spring on the St. Johns River. The branch was built by the Blue Spring, Orange City and Atlantic Railroad. In 1888, it became the Atlantic and Western Railroad. It later became part of the Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway, which changed its name to the Florida East Coast Railway in 1895. The line was in use until 1930.

===Tocoi Branch===
The railroad from Tocoi to Tocoi Junction (just west of St. Augustine), was built by the St. Johns Railway, an FEC predecessor (the original main line from Tocoi Junction to St. Augustine was also part of this line). The St. Johns Railway was built in 1858, making it the first FEC predecessor to be constructed. The Jacksonville, St. Augustine and Indian River Railway took it over by 1894, and changed its name to the Florida East Coast Railway in 1895. The Tocoi Branch was abandoned in April 1896, a year after the network was named the Florida East Coast Railway. This made the Tocoi Branch the first track to be abandoned by FEC. The right of way was later used for SR 95, which became State Road 214 at some time after the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering, and is now County Road 214.

===Flagler Beach Branch===
The railroad from Flagler Beach to Dorena, north of Bunnell, was built by the Lehigh Portland Cement Company in 1953. The line connected to the Lehigh Portland Cement Company Plant located near Flagler Beach. The line was abandoned in 1963, after a deadly strike erupted in that year that closed the massive plant. The site of the old plant was where some of the monorail beams were assembled for Walt Disney World Monorail System in the early 1970s. The route is now part of the rails to trails system. The plant has been demolished outside of one smokestack that will become a &quot;lighthouse&quot; for a new development. Some remains of the yard can be found in the woods near the eastern end of the Lehigh Greenway Rail Trail, which runs along the former right of way.

===San Mateo Branch===
The former San Mateo Branch ran from the main line just southeast of East Palatka south to San Mateo. It was built as a branch of the St. Johns and Halifax River Railroad (who built the original main line from East Palatka to Daytona) in 1892. The San Mateo Branch was abandoned in 1942.

===Mayport Branch===

This was originally built by the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad, a narrow gauge line from Jacksonville to Pablo Beach (now Jacksonville Beach). In late 1899 it was bought by Henry Flagler, who had the line converted to and extended it north along the coast to Mayport. The new branch opened in March 1900 and was abandoned in October 1932.

<text>Four ships of the British Royal Navy have been named HMS &quot;Caesar&quot;, after the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar.

<text>The New Year is an American indie rock band that formed in 1999. The band was started by former Bedhead members Matt and Bubba Kadane. They released their first album in 2001, &quot;Newness Ends&quot;, which like their following albums was recorded with Steve Albini. &quot;The End Is Near&quot; (2004) and &quot;The New Year&quot; (2008) followed, with both being received positively by music critics at Pitchfork Media and AllMusic. In February 2017, the band announced their first album in nine years, &quot;Snow&quot;, which was released on April 28, 2017.

==History==
===Background===
The band was formed in 1999, a year after the demise of the band Bedhead by former Bedhead members Matt and Bubba Kadane. The New Year was originally intended to be a two-person project made up of only the Kadane brothers. Four musicians, all longtime friends of the Kadanes, were slowly recruited for live performances and the lineup solidified.

Like Bedhead in its later years, The New Year started with no real base of operations. Early on Matt and Bubba Kadane were located respectively in Boston and Dallas. The band soon added bassist Mike Donofrio (of the band Saturnine, located in New York City), drummer Chris Brokaw (in Boston, formerly of the bands Codeine and Come), and guitarist Peter Schmidt (located in Dallas, formerly of the bands Three on a Hill, Funland, Legendary Crystal Chandelier, and part-time member of Bedhead).

===Recording and touring===
;&quot;Newness Ends&quot; (2001)
In 2000, The New Year recorded their first album, &quot;Newness Ends&quot;, in Chicago, with Steve Albini. Albini had previously recorded the final Bedhead album &quot;Transaction De Novo&quot;. &quot;Newness Ends&quot; was released in February 2001 on Touch &amp; Go Records. Because the lineup wasn&#x27;t complete at the time of its recording, not everyone credited on the album (namely Schmidt) actually played on it. The album garnered critical praise and comparison to the Kadanes&#x27; previous work. The Kadanes said in interviews at the time that they felt the only real difference between Bedhead and The New Year was the name, and that if Bedhead had not disbanded that their next album would have sounded very similar to &quot;Newness Ends&quot;.

For a time in 2003 their friend Josh McKay (of the Athens, Georgia band Macha) joined on keyboards, guitar, and random percussion. the members separated again with most working on other projects. The Kadanes recorded a score for the documentary film &quot;Hell House,&quot; the soundtrack of which wasn&#x27;t released until 2004, though the film first appeared in 2001. Brokaw released solo recordings, played on recordings by Evan Dando and Consonant and collaborated on a project with playwright Rinde Eckert. Peter Schmidt played with the Legendary Crystal Chandelier, whose second and final album, &quot;Beyond Indifference&quot;, was released at about the same time as &quot;Newness Ends&quot;.

;&quot;The End Is Near&quot; (2004)
In 2003 the members regrouped as The New Year to record the material that would become their album &quot;The End Is Near&quot;. The album, released by Touch &amp; Go Records in May 2004, was again recorded by Steve Albini. Positively received in publications such as the &quot;Dusted Magazine,&quot; the band filmed a music video (a first for the Kadanes) for the song &quot;Disease&quot; to accompany the album. The album yielded the band&#x27;s most popular single, &quot;The End&#x27;s Not Near,&quot; which quickly garnered over two hundred thousand views on YouTube.

;&quot;The New Year&quot; (2008)
A third album by The New Year, &quot;The New Year&quot;, was released on September 9, 2008. The material is described by Touch and Go Records in a press release stating, &quot;Lyrically, these ten songs address the interlocked themes of lost time, frustrated desire, and the need for others.&quot; Like with their other albums, the songs have three guitars. &quot;The New Year,&quot; however, was new in that almost half the songs are built around the piano.

The album was well-received, earning 4.5/5 stars from Allmusic and 7.5 from Pitchfork Media. A generally positive review by Pitchfork praised the album&#x27;s more cheerful melodies and hopeful lyrics, while noting the melancholy sound of the band&#x27;s previous releases was intact on many of the songs.

Will Johnson from the band Centro-matic accompanied the band on the US leg of its autumn 2008 tour.

;Overseas and &quot;Snow&quot; (2017) 

In June 2012 drummer Chris Brokaw posted on his website that &quot;The New Year has begun work on a new LP in Chicago, again with Mr. Steve Albini at the controls.&quot;

In early 2012 Bubba and Matt Kadane formed Overseas with David Bazan of Pedro The Lion and Will Johnson of Centro-matic. Their debut album was officially announced on April 4, 2013 and was released on June 11, 2013.

The New Year announced in early 2017 that their fourth album, titled &quot;Snow&quot;, would be released through the Undertow Music Collective. &quot;Snow&quot; is the first album by the group to not be issued through Touch and Go Records, and the first album by them since their 9-year absence. Four videos were released for the songs &quot;Myths,&quot; &quot;Snow,&quot; &quot;The Last Fall,&quot; and &quot;The Beast.&quot;

<doc id="864702" wikidata="Q311791" url="?curid=864702" title="Nikolai Rubinstein">
<text>Nikolai Grigoryevich Rubinstein (; – ) was a Russian pianist, conductor, and composer. He was the younger brother of Anton Rubinstein and a close friend of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

==Life==
Born to Jewish parents in Moscow, where his father had just opened a small factory, Rubinstein showed talent at the keyboard early on. He studied piano first with his mother, and while the family was in Berlin between 1844 and 1846, he studied piano with Theodor Kullak and harmony and counterpoint with Siegfried Dehn; during this time both he and his brother Anton attracted the interest and support of Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer. When the family returned to Moscow, Nikolai studied with Alexander Villoing, who also toured with him. He studied medicine to avoid army conscription, graduating from Moscow University in 1855.

As a result of his playing, Rubinstein was welcomed in all the fashionable artistocratic houses in Moscow. He co-founded the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society in 1859 and the Moscow Conservatory in 1866 with Prince Nikolai Petrovitch Troubetzkoy, serving as director of the latter until his death in 1881. He hired Tchaikovsky, then newly graduated from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, to teach harmony at Moscow Conservatory. He actively encouraged Tchaikovsky&#x27;s creative efforts and performed his compositions. Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky had a well-known falling-out over the latter&#x27;s First Piano Concerto, but Rubinstein later revised his position and became an ardent champion of the work. Rubinstein conducted the premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in 1879. Tchaikovsky wrote his Piano Trio in A minor in Rubinstein&#x27;s memory after he died from tuberculosis in Paris.

Rubinstein also conducted and performed music of the nationalistic music group &quot;The Five&quot; to a much greater degree than his brother. In 1869, when the group&#x27;s leader, Mily Balakirev, was forced to resign as conductor of the St. Petersburg branch of the Russian Musical Society, Rubinstein gave Balakirev his support, playing at concerts of the Free Music School as Balakirev&#x27;s guest. He also gave the first performance of Balakirev&#x27;s piano work &quot;&quot;, the work for which he is best known today.

==Pianism==
Nikolai Rubinstein was generally regarded as one of the greatest pianists of his time, although now his reputation is overshadowed by that of his brother Anton. His pianistic style was quite at odds with that of his fiery brother. He instead opted for a restrained classicism more in line with the musical values of Clara Schumann than Franz Liszt. Edward Garden writes in the &quot;New Grove&quot; (2001), &quot;His performances emphasized salient details of the structure of a piece and revealed great clarity of detail.&quot;

According to Harold C. Schonberg, Anton Rubinstein is reported to have said that &quot;if Nikolai had really worked on it, he could have been the better pianist of the two.&quot; One of Nikolai&#x27;s pupils, Emil von Sauer, wrote a comparison of the two brothers&#x27; playing styles in 1895:

It is difficult to say which was the better pianist. In every way as different as the brothers were in personal appearance—the one dark, almost to blackness; the other very fair — so different was their playing. The playing of Nicholas was more like that of Tausig, only warmer and more impulsive. Perhaps Anton Rubinstein was the more inspired player of the two, but he was unequal. Nicholas never varied; his playing both in private and in public was always the same, and he kept up the same standard of excellence.

==Students==
Nikolai Rubinstein&#x27;s best-known piano students were Sergei Taneyev, Emil von Sauer and Alexander Siloti. Sauer and Siloti went on to study under Franz Liszt. His other notable pupils included Ina Lange, Ernst Jedliczka and Henryk Pachulski.

==As a composer==

Rubinstein was also a composer of some note, though Garden dismisses his music as &quot;unimportant. Among his most popular works is his &quot;Tarantella&quot; in G minor and his Fantasia on a Theme by Schumann, both for piano solo. When asked why he did not compose more than he did, he replied that his brother Anton &quot;composed enough for three.&quot;

==Worklist (incomplete)==
* Op. 11 - Two mazurkas
* Op. 13 - Bolero
* Op. 14 - Tarentelle in G minor (pub. 1861 for solo piano; pub. 1877 for piano duet; also arranged for 2 pianos)
* Op. 15 - Polka for piano in E-flat major
* Op. 16 - Valse in A-flat major (later arranged for 2 pianos)
* Op. 17 - Scene de Bal (later arranged for 2 pianos)
* WoO - Two Feuilles d&#x27;Album

<text>The Furneaux Group is a group of approximately 100 islands located at the eastern end of Bass Strait, between Victoria and Tasmania, Australia. The islands were named after British navigator Tobias Furneaux, who sighted the eastern side of these islands after leaving Adventure Bay in 1773 on his way to New Zealand to rejoin Captain James Cook. Navigator Matthew Flinders was the first European to explore the Furneaux Islands group, in the in 1798, and later that year in the .

The largest islands in the group are Flinders Island, Cape Barren Island, and Clarke Island. The group contains five settlements:
Killiecrankie, Emita, Lady Barron, Cape Barren Island, and Whitemark on Flinders Island, which serves as the administrative centre of the Flinders Council. There are also some small farming properties on the remote islands.

After seals were discovered there in 1798, the Furneaux Group of islands became the most intensively exploited sealing ground in Bass Strait. A total of 29 islands in the Furneaux Group have been found to have some tangible link with sealing in the 19th century.

The Aboriginal matriarch, Dolly Dalrymple, was born on the Furneaux Islands. Her mother was one of two Aboriginal women who had been kidnapped from northern Tasmania by the sealer George Briggs.

King Island, at the western end of Bass Strait, is not a part of the group.

==Geology==
The islands contain granite from the Devonian period, as well as unconsolidated limestone and sand from Cenozoic periods. During the last ice age, a land bridge joined Tasmania to the Australian mainland through this group of islands.

<doc id="864711" wikidata="Q3640308" url="?curid=864711" title="Birdwell, South Yorkshire">
<text>Birdwell is a village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England and is located approximately south of Barnsley, north-east of Sheffield. Birdwell currently falls within the Rockingham Ward of the Barnsley Metropolitan Council, although plans to add most of Birdwell to the Worsbrough Ward were proposed again in 2024.

Neighbouring areas of Birdwell include Worsbrough Village, Tankersley and Hoyland Common.

The A61 (Sheffield Road) passes north–south through the length of Birdwell, and at the southern end is Birdwell Roundabout which is the junction between the M1 motorway at Junction 36 and the A61. The roundabout also marks the start of the Dearne Valley Parkway, a relatively new dual carriageway which links the M1 at Junction 36 to the A1 at Marr (near Doncaster).

== History ==
Although Birdwell was a hamlet in the Worsbrough area, the origins of Birdwell date back to the time of the English Civil War, around 1642, when the name of the small settlement is thought to be first mentioned.

Birdwell is part of the Parish of Worsbrough St Mary&#x27;s. The 11th century church is situated less than ½ mile away in nearby Worsbrough Village.

Birdwell was until 1974 part of the Worsbrough Urban District, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. 

In the years following the Second World War, open cast mining took place on much of the land to the northern end of Birdwell, and in some areas the remains of the quarries can still be found. Much of the land was subsequently restored to agriculture, mainly pasture with a little low key arable production and since the 1970s was owned by a local farming company. A small pocket of woodland called &quot;Parkinson Spring&quot; survived the mining activity and whilst little is known of its history, the name &#x27;spring&#x27; could infer it was coppiced for the production of spring wood. The predominantly ancient woodlands of Miller Hill and Wigfield Wood are thought to be remnants of the once extensive woodland of the Wortley Park estate, an area through which the M1 motorway was subsequently built.

Hangmanstone Depot was the site of Allan Finlay&#x27;s diesel engine export company Hartwood Exports, where a great number of UK buses and other commercial vehicles ended their lives.

Birdwell &amp; Hoyland Common railway station, was a railway station on the South Yorkshire Railway&#x27;s Blackburn Valley Line between Westwood and High Royds. The station was intended to serve Birdwell, Pilley and Hoyland Common, although the original chosen site was moved half a mile nearer towards Barnsley to serve the purposes of the Earl of Wharncliffe who was, at that time, sinking Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery in nearby Tankersley. The station was opened in February 1855, the building having an ornate canopy over its entrance and containing a private waiting room for use by the Earl of Wharncliffe. The station was closed on 7 December 1953.

Nearby coal mines including Barrow Colliery and Rockingham Colliery.

The obelisk was struck by lightning on 6 June 1906.
*St Mary&#x27;s Church, Worsbrough Village.

== Education ==
Birdwell has its own primary school(formerly Worsbrough Birdwell Primary) and private day-nursery called &quot;Chatterbox&quot;. Worsbrough St. Mary&#x27;s Primary closed in 2007, it was situated on the northern edge of Birdwell, near to Worsbrough Village.

==Sport==
Two football teams from the village have played in the FA Cup: Birdwell F.C. and Birdwell Primitive Methodists F.C.

Birdwell played in 11 FA Cup competitions between 1907 and 1928 whereas Birdwell Primitive Methodists played in just the one FA Cup competition, losing their one and only FA Cup game. The game on 11 September 1909 was against Atlas and Norfolk Works. The Sheffield side had originally been drawn at home but the game was played at Birdwell. The &#x27;Primitives&#x27;, as they were often known, took the lead and were level with the visitors at half-time but the latter proved too strong and ran out 4-1 winners, Nuttall scoring all four goals.

<text>Town ball, townball, or Philadelphia town ball, is a bat-and-ball, safe haven game played in North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, which was similar to rounders and was a precursor to modern baseball. In some areas, including Philadelphia and along the Ohio River and Mississippi River—the local game was called Town Ball. In other regions the local game was named &quot;base&quot;, &quot;round ball&quot;, &quot;base ball&quot;, or just &quot;ball&quot;; after the development of the &quot;New York game&quot; in the 1840s it was sometimes distinguished as the &quot;New England game&quot; or &quot;Massachusetts baseball&quot;. The players might be schoolboys in a pasture with improvised balls and bats, or young men in organized clubs. As baseball became dominant, town ball became a casual term to describe old fashioned or rural games similar to baseball.

==Rules==
The rules of town ball varied, but distinguishing characteristics most often cited were:
* The number of players on a team was usually more than nine.
* There was no foul territory; all struck balls were in play.
* In many versions, base runners could be put out by hitting them with the ball—a practice known as &quot;soaking&quot; or &quot;plugging.&quot;

Generally the infield was a square or rectangular shape, with four bases or pegs. Similarly to baseball, the fourth base was called home base, as it was the final goal of a runner. However, differently from baseball—and more like English rounders—the striker would stand between first and fourth base, at a kind of fifth base called the striker&#x27;s stand. The thrower stood in the middle of the square and delivered the ball to be hit by the striker. If the struck ball were caught in mid-air or on the first bounce, the striker was called out. If no one caught it, the striker became a runner and advanced as many bases as possible, with the option to stop at any base as a safe haven.

In most varieties of the game, fielders could hit the runner with the ball and if he were not on a base he would be called out. But in some, the cross-out was used: the fielder threw the ball so as to cross the runner&#x27;s path, between him and the next base. A runner who reached fourth base safely was said to have achieved a round or tally.

The concept of innings was used: the team with the bat was &quot;in&quot;, until put &quot;out&quot; by the opposing side. If &quot;one-out, all-out&quot; was the rule, the defensive team only needed to retire one man to end the inning. However, the game might also be played as &quot;all-out, all-out&quot;, meaning that every player had to be retired (as in cricket) before sides were changed. Matches might be played for an agreed-upon number of innings, or until one side had achieved a requisite number of tallies.

==Town ball and the Doubleday myth==
Townball&#x27;s role in the origins of baseball has been debated since the early 1900s, and the two sides of the debate stem from a friendly quarrel between an editor and his publisher. In the 1903 edition of &quot;Spalding&#x27;s Official Base Ball Guide&quot;, editor Henry Chadwick, who was born in England, wrote &quot;Just as the New York game was improved townball, so was townball an improved form of the two-centuries-old English game of rounders.&quot;

Albert Goodwill Spalding, star player, sports equipment entrepreneur, and publisher of the &quot;Spalding Guide&quot;, asserted that baseball&#x27;s origins were American. Spalding wrote an article titled &quot;The Origin and Early History of Baseball&quot; for the January 15, 1905 &quot;Washington Post&quot;. He described the game of Four Old Cat, in which four throwers and four batsmen stand in four corners. &quot;Some ingenious American lad&quot; got the idea of placing one thrower in the center of the square, wrote Spalding. &quot;This was for many years known as the old game of Town Ball, from which the present game of baseball no doubt had its origin, and not from the English children&#x27;s picnic game of &#x27;Rounders&#x27;.&quot;

Later, in 1905, Spalding organized a panel of experts known as the Mills Commission to investigate the issue. Abner Graves, whose testimony was the basis of the Mills Commission claim that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, named townball as the &quot;old&quot; game that the boys of Cooperstown, New York played before baseball. In the townball game that Graves described, the batsman struck the tossed ball with a flat bat, and ran toward a goal fifty feet away, and back again. Graves said there were generally twenty to fifty boys in the field, which generated many collisions among those trying to catch the ball.

==Philadelphia town ball==
Most accounts of a game called town ball were recorded many years later as reminiscences or memoirs. It is more difficult to find contemporary descriptions. One of the earliest was a &quot;New York Clipper&quot; article dated September 19, 1857, reporting a &quot;Game of Town Ball&quot; at Germantown (now a neighborhood of Philadelphia). Reporting another game, the Clipper for August 11, 1860, commented, &quot;The Olympic Club dates its existence back to 1832, so that properly speaking it is the parent Town Ball organization in the city of Philadelphia.&quot;

Informal groups were playing town ball at Market Street in Philadelphia and across the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey, in 1831 and 1832. Irving Leitner quotes a 19th-century source: &quot;All the players were over 25 years of age, and to see them playing a game like this caused much merriment among the friends of the players. It required &#x27;sand&#x27; in those days to go out on the field and play, as the prejudice against the game was very great.&quot;

The two groups merged in 1833 to form the Olympic Ball Club. In the introduction to his book &quot;Baseball&quot;, John Montgomery Ward wrote of the Philadelphia game:
A copy of the Olympic Ball Club&#x27;s constitution exists, but it contains only rules for governing the club, and no rules for playing ball. Contemporary accounts describe Philadelphia town ball as played with eleven men on a side, with four bases and the batter standing between fourth and first bases. They played two innings of &quot;all-out, all-out&quot; or eleven innings of &quot;one-out, all-out&quot;. Typical games were high-scoring with the victorious side often topping 75 runs. The players are said to have made their own bats and balls. They were adept with two types of bats. For a two-handed swing, a flat cricket-type bat was used. For a one-handed swing, a smaller round model, called a delill, was chosen. There is evidence that over the course of three decades the Olympics played varieties of baseball, wicket, and old cat, as well as town ball.

In Philadelphia Town Ball, &quot;every at bat resulted in a home run or an out&quot;. The bases were very close together, and were not safe havens, serving merely to mark the circuit the batter-runner must take. &quot;Soaking&quot; was permitted but rare.

In 1860 the Olympics converted to the modern &quot;New York game&quot;, but the old style was still being played in rural areas. That year, members of Athletic of Philadelphia, originally formed as a town ball club, traveled to Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, for two contests, one of New York-style baseball and the other of town ball. The Mauch Chunk team defeated the A&#x27;s, 45–43, at town ball. But playing New York rules, the A&#x27;s defeated the country players, 34–2. The Athletics were soon to be a national baseball powerhouse. The Olympic Club, after a bitterly publicized rivalry with the A&#x27;s, dropped out of major match play in 1864, and many of the members went back to playing town ball.

==Town ball in the west==
* In Cincinnati, Ohio the informal Excelsior Townball Club was formed in 1860; the players were young schoolteachers and their friends, and hospital interns. Reportedly they used a small bat which was swung with one hand, in games of four innings, with 10 to 15 players on a side. The more formal Cincinnati Buckeye Townball Club was established in 1863.
* Indiana Author Edward Eggleston remembers a pre-Civil War schoolyard game:
* The town of Canton, Illinois was incorporated in 1837. At the first meeting of the town trustees (aldermen), March 27, 1837, Section 36 of the Ordinances was enacted: &quot;any person who shall on the Sabbath day play at bandy, cricket, cat, town-ball, corner-ball, over-ball, fives, or any other game of ball, within the limits of the corporation, or shall engage in pitching dollars or quarters, or any other game, in any public place, shall, on conviction thereof, be fined the sum of one dollar.&quot;
* Henry J. Philpott described himself as &quot;a pupil and teacher in country schools within twenty miles of the Mississippi River, and about half-way between St. Louis and St. Paul.&quot; He wrote a story called &quot;A Little Boys&#x27; Game with a Ball&quot; for &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; in 1890. Philpott writes that the boys played Old Cat until they had more than eight players; then they switched to town-ball. &quot;In &#x27;town-ball&#x27; there was as yet no distinction between base-men [infielders] and fielders. After the pitcher and catcher had been selected, the others on that side went where they pleased; and they did not get to bat until they had put all the batters out.&quot; He writes that after baseball was introduced, town-ball &quot;was so different that for some years the two games were played side by side, each retaining its own name.&quot;

==The Massachusetts Game==

New Englanders usually called their game &quot;base&quot; or &quot;round ball&quot; (from running &#x27;round the bases). The &quot;Massachusetts game&quot; or &quot;New England game&quot; was a formalized version with many clubs active in the Boston area. A set of rules was drawn up by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at Dedham, Massachusetts in 1858. This game was played by ten to fourteen players with four bases 60 feet apart and no foul territory. The ball was considerably smaller and lighter than a modern baseball, and runners were put out by &quot;soaking&quot;—hitting them with the thrown ball. Innings were &quot;one-out, all-out&quot; and the first club to reach 100 runs was the winner. Although it had its adherents until the 1860s, the Massachusetts game was superseded by the &quot;three-out, all-out&quot; &quot;New York game&quot; of baseball, with its Knickerbocker Rules which formed the basis of the modern game of baseball.

==Old-fashioned base ball==

Another term applied retroactively to precursor baseball games was &quot;old-fashioned base ball&quot;. This game was generally identified as a type of baseball with large numbers on each side, where the fielders threw the ball at the runner. The Knickerbocker Antiquarian Base Ball Club of Newark, New Jersey continued to play old-fashioned baseball at least until 1865. After the Civil War, old-timers still put on exhibitions of traditional baseball at picnics and charity events. For instance, in Mauston, Wisconsin in 1888, the festivities at The Old Settlers Jubilee included &quot;an old-fashioned base ball game.&quot; Ironically, the only mention of baseball in &quot;&quot; describes an old-fashioned game:

1877. A famous game of old-fashioned base ball was played here, in August—Judge Sturges heading the &quot;Reds&quot; and Judge Edick the &quot;Blues&quot;—16 on a side. The victory was with the &quot;Blues.&quot; It called together a large concourse of people.

Many articles were written waxing nostalgically for the old game. This nostalgia was satirized by Robert J. Burdette in his story &quot;Rollo Learning to Play&quot;:

Varieties of town ball remained a popular schoolyard activity, especially in rural areas, well into the 20th century. In recent times the Massachusetts Rules have occasionally been used by &quot;vintage&quot; baseball clubs, such as the Leatherstocking Base Ball Club of Cooperstown, New York.

==Famous town ball players==

===Abraham Lincoln===
Project Protoball lists Abraham Lincoln as a player in the 1840s. According to biographer Albert Beveridge, &quot;He joined with gusto in outdoor sports—foot-races, jumping and hopping contests, town ball, wrestling.&quot;

In another Protoball reference, Henry C. Whitney, in &quot;Lincoln the Citizen&quot; writes of the future President in 1860: &quot;During the settling on the convention Lincoln had been trying, in one way and another, to keep down the excitement ... playing billiards a little, town ball a little, and story-telling a little.&quot;

Irving Leitner quotes a story by Frank Blair, grandson of Francis P. Blair, one of Lincoln&#x27;s political confidants:

There were eight or ten of us, our ages ranging from eight to twelve years. Although I was but seven or eight years of age, Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s visits were of such importance to us boys as to leave a clear impression on my memory. He drove out to the place quite frequently. We boys, for hours at a time played &#x27;town ball&#x27; on the vast lawn, and Mr. Lincoln would join ardently in the sport. I remember vividly how he ran with the children; how long were his strides, and how far his coat-tails stuck out behind, and how we tried to hit him with the ball, as he ran the bases. He entered into the spirit of the play as completely as any of us, and we invariably hailed his coming with delight.
===Ty Cobb===
In his book &quot;My Life in Baseball&quot;, Ty Cobb wrote about ballplaying in Georgia around 1898: &quot;At eleven and twelve, I liked to play cow-pasture baseball—what we called town ball.&quot; He wrote of whacking a string ball and &quot;then chasing madly about the bases while an opponent tried to retrieve said pill and sock you with it.&quot; In this version of town ball, a home run entitled the hitter to another turn at bat.

<doc id="864716" wikidata="Q716144" url="?curid=864716" title="Sook Ching">
<text>Sook Ching was a mass killing that occurred from 18 February to 4 March 1942 in Singapore after it fell to the Japanese. It was a systematic purge and massacre of &#x27;anti-Japanese&#x27; elements in Singapore, with the Singaporean Chinese particularly targeted by the Japanese military during the occupation. However, Japanese soldiers engaged in indiscriminate killing and did not try to identify who was &#x27;anti-Japanese.&#x27; 

Singapore was a crucial strategic point in World War II. From 8 February to 15 February, the Japanese fought for control of the city. The combined British and Commonwealth forces surrendered in a stunning defeat to the outnumbered Japanese on 15 February which led to its fall. The loss of Singapore was and still is Britain&#x27;s largest surrender in history.

Three days later after the fall on 18 February, the occupying Japanese military began mass killings of a wide range of &quot;undesirables&quot;, who were mostly ethnic Chinese, influenced by the events of the Second Sino-Japanese War that was raging simultaneously as far back as 1937. The operation was overseen by the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Kempeitai, its secret police. Along with Singapore, the Sook Ching was subsequently also extended to include the Chinese population in Malaya, which was also under occupation by the Japanese. Concurrently, non-Chinese individuals were also not completely spared in other parts of Asia under Japanese occupation. The Japanese also brutally subjugated civilians in Burma and Thailand, with estimates of up to 90,000 additional deaths. Many of these victims were also forced to work on the Siam–Burma Railway, infamously known as the Death Railway.

The aim for such a purge was to intimidate the Chinese community, which was considered by the Japanese to be potentially the main centre of resistance to Japanese aims of territorial expansion throughout the Asia-Pacific. The Japanese had also thought of it as a &quot;revenge&quot; for their perceived anti-Japanese activity in the Sinophone regions, such as procuring financial aid for China after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As a consequence, Sook Ching was aimed primarily at Chinese political and social activists, volunteers fighting on the side of the Allies, as well as representatives of Chinese triads. In practice, however, the arrests and executions were carried out by the Japanese in a completely arbitrary manner, with many civilians randomly killed in summary executions even if they took no part in any organised resistance.

After the war, the Japanese authorities acknowledged that the massacre took place, but disagreed about the number of deaths that Japan had caused. Japan alleged that no more &quot;than 6,000 deaths&quot; had occurred, while Singapore&#x27;s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was himself almost a victim to Sook Ching, stated that verifiable numbers would put it at &quot;about 70,000&quot;, including the figures in Malaya. When mass graves were discovered in 1962, Singaporeans heavily lobbied for their government to demand compensation as well as an official apology from the Japanese government. On 25 October 1966, the Japanese government ultimately agreed to reimburse S$50 million in reparations, half of which constituting as a grant and the rest as a loan. However, the wording used for this reimbursement was classified as a &quot;gesture of atonement&quot;, with words such as &quot;damages&quot; or &quot;reparations&quot; being avoided by the Japanese. Furthermore, the Japanese government continued to refuse to accept legal responsibility for the massacre, which would include carrying out an official investigation or inquiry of the deaths. No official apology was made. Remains of Sook Ching victims would subsequently continue to be unearthed by Singaporeans for decades after the massacre. In 1963, the Civilian War Memorial was constructed in memory of the civilians killed during the occupation, including Sook Ching. Remains belonging to some of the victims were also placed in a tomb under the memorial. In 1992, the various Sook Ching massacre sites around the country such as Changi Beach, Katong, Punggol Point, Tanah Merah and Sentosa were designated with historic plaque markers as heritage sites by the Singaporean government&#x27;s National Heritage Board, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the occupation.

== Etymology ==
===Japan===
The Japanese referred to the &quot;Sook Ching&quot; as the &quot;Kakyō Shukusei&quot; (, &#x27;purging of Overseas Chinese&#x27;) or as the &quot;Shingapōru Daikenshō&quot; (, &#x27;great inspection of Singapore&#x27;). The current Japanese term for the massacre is &quot;Shingapōru Kakyō Gyakusatsu Jiken&quot; (, &#x27;Singapore Overseas Chinese Massacre&#x27;).

===Singapore===
Singapore&#x27;s National Heritage Board (NHB) uses the term &quot;Sook Ching&quot; in its publications. In Chinese languages, the term (肅清, Hokkien siok-chheng/sok-chheng, Teochew sog4 cêng1, Cantonese suk1 cing1, Mandarin sùqīng) means, among other things, &quot;eradication&quot; or &quot;purge&quot;.

==Planning of the massacre==
According to postwar testimony taken from a war correspondent embedded with the 25th army, Colonel Hishakari Takafumi, an order to kill 50,000 Chinese, 20 percent of the total, was issued by senior officials on Yamashita&#x27;s operations staff, either from Lieutenant Colonel Tsuji Masanobu, Chief of Planning and Operations, or Major Hayashi Tadahiko, Chief of Staff.

Hirofumi Hayashi, a professor of politics at a university and the co-director of the Center for Research and Documentation on Japan&#x27;s War Responsibility, writes that the massacre was premeditated, and that &quot;the Chinese in Singapore were regarded as anti-Japanese even before the Japanese military landed&quot;. It is also clear from the passage below that the massacre was to be extended to the Chinese in Malaya as well.

==Purge==

===Screening===

After the fall of Singapore, Masayuki Oishi, commander of No. 2 Field Kenpeitai, set up his headquarters in the YMCA Building at Stamford Road as the Kenpeitai East District Branch. The Kenpeitai prison was in Outram with branches in Stamford Road, Chinatown and the Central Police Station. A residence at the intersection of Smith Street and New Bridge Road formed the Kenpeitai West District Branch.

Under Oishi&#x27;s command were 200 regular Kenpeitai officers and another 1000 auxiliaries, who were mostly young and rough peasant soldiers. Singapore was divided into sectors with each sector under the control of an officer. The Japanese set up designated &quot;screening centres&quot; all over Singapore to gather and &quot;screen&quot; Chinese males between the ages of 18 and 50. Those who were thought to be &quot;anti-Japanese&quot; would be eliminated. Sometimes, women and children were also sent for inspection as well.

According to Kevin Blackburn, associate professor at Nanyang Technological University:

The following passage is from an article from the National Heritage Board:

According to the &quot;A Country Study: Singapore&quot; published by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress:

The ones who passed the &quot;screening&quot; received a piece of paper bearing the word &quot;examined&quot; or have a square ink mark stamped on their arms or shirts. Those who failed were stamped with triangular marks instead. They were separated from the others and packed into trucks near the centres and sent to the killing sites.

===Execution===
There were several sites for the killings, the most notable ones being Changi Beach, Punggol Point and Sentosa (or Pulau Belakang Mati).

In a quarterly newsletter, the National Heritage Board published the account of the life story of a survivor named Chia Chew Soo, whose father, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters were bayoneted one by one by Japanese soldiers in Simpang Village.

===Extension to Chinese community of Malaya===
At the behest of Masanobu Tsuji, the Japanese High Command&#x27;s Chief of Planning and Operations, Sook Ching was extended to the rest of Malaya. However, due to a far wider population distribution across urban centres and vast rural regions, the Chinese population in Malaya was less concentrated and more difficult to survey. Lacking sufficient time and manpower to organise a full &quot;screening&quot;, the Japanese opted instead to conduct widespread and indiscriminate massacres of the Chinese population. The primary bulk of the killings were conducted between February and March, and were largely concentrated in the southern states of Malaya, closer to Singapore.

====Targeted locations====
Specific incidents were Kota Tinggi, Johore (28 February 1942) – 2,000 killed; Gelang Patah, Johor (4 March) – 300 killed; Benut, Johor (6 March) – number unknown; Johore Bahru, Senai, Kulai, Sedenak, Pulai, Renggam, Kluang, Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Senggarang, Parit Bakau, and Muar (February–March) – estimated up to 25,000 Chinese were killed in Johor; Tanjung Kling, Malacca (16 March) – 142 killed; Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan (15 March) – 76 killed; Parit Tinggi, Negeri Sembilan (16 March) – more than 100 killed (the entire village); Joo Loong Loong (near the present village of Titi) on 18 March (1474 killed, entire village eliminated by Major Yokokoji Kyomi and his troops); and Penang (April) – several thousand killed by Major Higashigawa Yoshimura. Further massacres were instigated as a result of increased guerilla activity in Malaya, most notably at Sungei Lui, a village of 400 in Jempol District, Negeri Sembilan, which was wiped out on 31 July 1942 by troops under a Corporal Hashimoto.

===Mass murder of Tamils of Malaya and Singapore===
The Japanese also killed about 150,000 Tamil Indians in Thailand and Myanmar during the war, although it is believed that the true number of deaths is much higher for the Tamil Indians. It excludes the death toll of the Malayali Indians. The Indians came from Singapore or Malaya under Japanese supervision.

Japanese camp guards frequently killed entire Indian families or the entire Indian population of whole camps. They also killed Indian families or camps that were infected with typhus, sometimes for sadistic reasons. Aside from killing the Indians, Japanese soldiers often gang raped Tamil women after which they would force other Indian coolies to rape the Indian women.

==Death toll==
Due to the lack of concrete written records by the Japanese when orchestrating the massacre as well as many of the deaths being the result of random summary executions, the official death toll remains unknown. Japan acknowledged the massacre after the war, but alleged a death toll of about 6,000, whereas the Singaporean Chinese community as well as prime minister Lee Kuan Yew alleged a death toll of about 70,000 to 100,000. Retrospective analysis by historians as well as the scale of mass graves that was discovered decades after the massacre ranges the death toll at about 25,000 to 50,000.

According to Lieutenant Colonel Hishakari Takafumi, a newspaper correspondent at the time, the plan was to ultimately kill about 50,000 Chinese, and half that (25,000) had already been achieved when the order was received to scale down the operation. He said Major Hayashi Tadahiko told him that &quot;it had been found to be impossible to kill the whole of the 50,000 people, as after half that number had been killed an order was received &#x27;to stop the massacre.

Japanese historian Hirofumi Hayashi wrote in another paper:

Having witnessed the brutality of the Japanese, Lee made the following comments:

===Prominent victims===
Chinese film pioneer Hou Yao had emigrated to Singapore in 1940 to work for the Shaw brothers as well as to largely avoid the Japanese invasion of China. Because Hou had directed and written a number of patriotic Chinese &quot;national defence&quot; films against that invasion, he was targeted by the Japanese immediately after Singapore fell and killed at the beginning of the massacre.

==Aftermath==


===Trial===
In 1947, after the Japanese surrender, British authorities in Singapore held a war crimes trial for the perpetrators of the Sook Ching. Seven Japanese officers: Takuma Nishimura, Saburo Kawamura, Masayuki Oishi, Yoshitaka Yokata, Tomotatsu Jo, Satoru Onishi, and Haruji Hisamatsu, were charged with conducting the massacre. Staff officer Masanobu Tsuji was the mastermind behind the massacre, and personally planned and carried it out, but at the time of the war crimes trials he had not been arrested. As soon as the war ended, Tsuji escaped from Thailand to China. The accused seven persons who followed Tsuji&#x27;s commands were on trial.

During the trial, one major problem was that the Japanese commanders did not pass down any formal written orders for the massacre. Documentation of the screening process or disposal procedures had also been destroyed. Besides, the Japanese military headquarters&#x27; order for the speedy execution of the operation, combined with ambiguous instructions from the commanders, led to suspicions being cast on the accused, and it became difficult to accurately establish their culpability.

====Verdict====
Saburo Kawamura and Masayuki Oishi received the death penalty while the other five received life sentences, though Takuma Nishimura was later executed in 1951 following conviction by an Australian military court for his role in the Parit Sulong Massacre. The court accepted the defence statement of &quot;just following orders&quot; by those put on trial. The condemned were hanged on 26 June 1947. The British authorities allowed only six members of the victims&#x27; families to witness the executions of Kawamura and Oishi, despite calls for the hangings to be made public.

The mastermind behind the massacre, Masanobu Tsuji, escaped. Tsuji, later after the trial and the execution, appeared in Japan and became a politician there. Tsuji evaded trial, but later disappeared, presumedly killed in Laos in 1961. Tomoyuki Yamashita, the general from whose headquarters the order seems to have been issued, was put on another trial in the Philippines and executed in 1946. Other staff officers, who planned the massacre, were and Sōsaku Suzuki. But, as Asaeda was captured in Russia after the war, and Suzuki killed in action in 1945 before the end of the war, they were not put on trial.

The reminiscences of Saburo Kawamura were published in 1952 (after his death) and, in the book, he expressed his condolences to the victims of Singapore and prayed for the repose of their souls.

Mamoru Shinozaki (February 1908 – 1991), a former Japanese diplomat, has been described as instrumental as key prosecution witness during the Singapore War Crimes Trial between 1946 and 1948. Shinozaki remains a controversial figure, with some blaming him for saying positive things about the accused (despite being a prosecuting witness); views on him continue to vary, with opinions ranging from calling him the &quot;wire-puller&quot; of the massacre or criticizing him for &quot;self-praise&quot; in his autobiography to calling him a life-saving &quot;Schindler&quot; of Singapore.

===Post-war sentiment===
====Reparations====
When Singapore gained full self-government from the British colonial government in 1959, waves of anti-Japanese sentiments arose within the Chinese community and they demanded reparations and an apology from Japan. Prior to self-governance, the British colonial government had only demanded war reparations for damage caused to British property during the war, but not the ones suffered by the Chinese, Malays, and Indians. Actions such as these, among others, was what resulted in many of the local populace of all ethnic groups feeling that the British were no longer competent in Singapore&#x27;s administration and defence after the war.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry declined Singapore&#x27;s request for an apology and reparations in 1963, stating that the issue of war reparations with the British had already been settled in the San Francisco Treaty in 1951 and hence with Singapore as well, which was then still a British colony. Singapore&#x27;s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew responded by saying that the British colonial government did not represent the voice of Singaporeans. In September 1963, the Chinese community staged a boycott of Japanese imports by refusing to unload aircraft and ships from Japan, which lasted for a week.

Lee, however, was also a pragmatist, and was actually somewhat concerned by the boycott. He felt that the tenacious emphasis on the martyrdom of the Sook Ching victims would disrupt the fragile ethnic balance and destroy his efforts to build a united Singaporean national identity, in addition to obstructing Singapore&#x27;s &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic policy at the Port of Singapore. As a result, he took the position that the commemoration activities must be aimed at paying tribute to all civilian victims of the Japanese occupation, irrespective of their ethnic origin. After all, he added that the Japanese were brutal to all ethnic groups. Lee also wanted Japan&#x27;s compensation to the families of Sook Ching victims to also complement contributing to the development of Singapore.

===Acknowledgement===
According to Hirofumi Hayashi, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs &quot;accepted that the Japanese military had carried out mass killings in Singapore ... During negotiations with Singapore, the Japanese government rejected demands for reparations but agreed to make a &#x27;gesture of atonement&#x27; by providing funds in other ways.&quot;

Nevertheless, the Japanese government was motivated to provide compensation to Singapore because of the potential economic damage to Japan as a result of a boycott or sabotage by the local Chinese should Singapore&#x27;s demands be rejected. They also saw the potential for Singapore&#x27;s post-war ensuing success and was keen on repairing their relations.

With Singapore&#x27;s full independence from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, the Singapore government made another request to Japan for reparations and an apology. On 25 October 1966, Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. However, Japan did not make an official apology. These payments were also classified as a &quot;gesture of atonement&quot;, and not &quot;damages&quot; or &quot;reparations&quot;. Also, the Japanese government refused legal responsibility for the massacre and an investigation into the death toll.
==Remains and commemoration==

Due to the fact that only a few remains of Sook Ching victims were found during the occupation and in the first post-war years, the families of the murdered did not have the opportunity to commemorate their relatives while respecting Chinese traditions. For this reason, a Taoist ceremony was held in early 1948 in the neighbourhood of Siglap in the eastern part of Singapore, in what is known as the &quot;Valley Of Tears&quot; – where mass graves from the Japanese occupation period were suspected to be, a Taoist ceremony was held to &quot;soothe hungry ghosts.&quot;

Thousands of Singaporean Chinese – mostly family members of the victims – took part in it. In the same year, a special committee was established, chaired by local businessman Tay Koh Yat. His task was to find the remains of Sook Ching victims. For the first dozen or so years, the effects of the committee&#x27;s work were, however, extremely modest.

===Discovery of mass graves===
It was not until 1962 that the mass graves of Sook Ching victims were accidentally discovered at the &quot;Valley Of Tears&quot; in Siglap. On the initiative of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, search and exhumation work began – also in other alleged Japanese crime scenes. In the years 1962 to 1966, nearly 100 graves were discovered. The Chinese community called for the construction of a cemetery in Siglap and a monument to the victims of the massacre. The remains of the victims of the Sook Ching would continue to be unearthed by locals for decades after the massacre.

===Heritage sites===
A memorial to the victims of the Japanese occupation, known as the Civilian War Memorial, was erected at Beach Road in central Singapore. It was unveiled on 15 February 1967, 25 years after the fall, during a ceremony attended by prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. The monument consists of four pillars, 67.4 meters high, symbolizing the four largest ethnic groups in the country. The pedestal of the memorial also has inscriptions written in Singapore&#x27;s four official languages, English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. Under the monument, there is a tomb containing the remains of Sook Ching victims, which were found from 1962 to 1966. Every year on 15 February, on the anniversary of Singapore&#x27;s surrender, ceremonies are held at the Civilian War Memorial in honor of the victims of the war.

The massacre sites of Changi Beach, Katong, Punggol Point, Tanah Merah and Sentosa were marked as heritage sites in 1992 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Japanese occupation.

Among other sites, this specific war monument plaque was erected at the Changi Beach Park (near Camp Site 2) in the eastern part of Singapore. The inscription on the monument plaque, which was also repeated in Singapore&#x27;s three other official languages of Chinese, Malay and Tamil, as well as in Japanese, reads:


==Legacy==
The massacre and its post-war judicial handling by the colonial British administration incensed the Chinese community. The Discovery Channel programme commented about its historic impact on local Chinese: &quot;They felt the Japanese spilling of so much Chinese blood on Singapore soil has given them the moral claim to the island that hasn&#x27;t existed before the war&quot;. Lee Kuan Yew said on the Discovery Channel programme, &quot;It was the catastrophic consequences of the war that changed the mindset, that my generation decided that, &#x27;No ... this doesn&#x27;t make sense. We should be able to run this [island] as well as the British did, if not better. &quot;The Asiatics had looked to them for leadership, and they had failed them.&quot;

Germaine Foo-Tan writes in an article carried on the Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) website:

The memories of those who lived through that period have been captured at exhibition galleries in the Old Ford Motor Factory at Bukit Timah, the site of the factory where the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942.

<doc id="864718" wikidata="Q2315147" url="?curid=864718" title="Sredni Vashtar">
<text>&quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; is a short story by Saki (Hector Hugh Munro), written between 1900 and 1911 and first published in his 1911 short story collection &quot;The Chronicles of Clovis&quot;. It has been adapted for opera, film, radio and television.

==Plot==

Conradin, a sickly 10-year-old boy, lives in the care of his despised, overbearing and controlling cousin Mrs De Ropp. He relies on his vivid imagination not only to keep him strong enough to survive, but also to serve as his escape from the real world. Rebelling against Mrs De Ropp&#x27;s oppressive care, Conradin secretly keeps two animals in an unused garden shed: a hen, which he adores, and a polecat-ferret, which he fears and keeps locked in a hutch. Gradually, Conradin begins to venerate the ferret as a god, naming it Sredni Vashtar. He worships it weekly, bringing offerings of flowers and berries, and stolen nutmeg for special occasions.

Mrs De Ropp grows concerned over Conradin&#x27;s visits to the shed. She discovers the hen, and sells it. She announces the sale to Conradin, expecting a protest, but to her surprise the boy does not respond. But in secret, he changes his worshipping rituals and asks of his god an unnamed boon: &quot;Do one thing for me, Sredni Vashtar&quot;.

When Conradin&#x27;s visits to the shed do not cease, Mrs De Ropp investigates further, and discovers the locked hutch. Suspecting guinea pigs, she ransacks his room, finds the key, and goes down to the shed, forbidding Conradin to leave the house. While she is gone, Conradin slowly begins to accept defeat, knowing that his god was not real and that his cousin will come out of the shed in triumph. But when Mrs De Ropp fails to reappear after some time, Conradin begins to chant a song of victory. Eventually he sees the ferret emerge from the shed, with dark wet stains around its jaws and throat. It passes out into the garden.

A sour-faced maid announces tea and asks for Mrs De Ropp. Conradin tells her that she has gone to the shed, and makes himself a piece of buttered toast. As he enjoys his toast, there are screams from the maid, calls for help from the kitchen staff, and later the sound of something heavy being carried into the house. As voices discuss fervently who should break the news to the boy, Conradin calmly makes himself another piece of toast.

==Adaptations==
On September 15, 1941, an adaptation of &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; began the premiere episode of the CBS Radio series &quot;The Orson Welles Show&quot;. Blanche Yurka portrayed Mrs. De Ropp, with Conrad Binyon as Conradin and Brenda Forbes as Matilda.

&quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; has been adapted as a chamber opera three times. In 1988 the composer Robert Steadman and the author Richard Adams wrote the 75-minute &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;. In 1996 Cuban-born composer Jorge Martin and librettist Andrew Joffe with the American Chamber Orchestra produced &quot;Beast and Superbeast&quot;, a group of four chamber operas based on stories by Saki, including &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot;. Martin also composed a &quot;Piano Fantasy on Sredni Vashtar&quot; In 2010 the story was again adapted by Nicholas Pavkovic and Jim Coughenour and performed at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.

This story was adapted for American television and aired on a ghost anthology series called &quot;Great Ghost Tales&quot; on August 24, 1961. &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; was the basis of the 1979 horror film &quot;The Orphan&quot;, also known as &quot;Friday the 13th: The Orphan&quot;, by the director John Ballard. In 1980 it was adapted for &quot;Spine Chillers&quot;. In 1981, the short film &quot;Sredni Vashtar&quot; by British director Andrew Birkin won a BAFTA award and was nominated for an Oscar. In 2003 Angela M. Murray produced a version of the story in the &quot;Tartan Shorts&quot; series for the BBC, set in Scotland and including shadow puppetry.

The story has inspired film directors of the Czech Republic three times: Vaclav Bedrich&#x27;s cartoon film of 1981, Martin Faltyn&#x27;s 1981 graduation film from the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, and Pavel Marek&#x27;s 1995 graduation film from the FAMU. It has even been the inspiration for a Czech rock band, who named themselves after the story.

<text>Everett Transit is the public transit authority of Everett, Washington, the only city in Snohomish County not to belong to Community Transit. As of 2017, Everett Transit operates 42 buses within Everett on ten routes. Its annual ridership in 2016 was about 2 million.

Everett Transit became a department of the City of Everett in 1969, though it traces its roots back to the first public transit service to operate in the city, Everett City Lines, which began in 1893. The system has several hubs, including Everett Station, Everett Community College, Seaway Transit Center, and Everett Mall Station.

A budget crisis in the late 2010s had led to discussions about merging the system with Community Transit. , Everett Transit has a fleet of 42 buses, of which 19 are battery electric models from Proterra and Gillig.

<text>The &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue is published annually by American magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and features female fashion models, celebrities and athletes wearing swimwear in various locales around the world. The highly coveted cover photograph has been considered as the arbiter of supermodel succession. The issue carries advertising that, in 2005, amounted to in value. First published in 1964, it is credited with making the bikini, invented in 1946, a legitimate piece of apparel.

Since 1964, the issue had been published every February, but starting in 2019, the issue was made available in May.

==History==
The swimsuit issue was invented by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; editor Andre Laguerre to fill the winter months, a typically slow point in the sporting calendar. He asked fashion reporter Jule Campbell to go on a shoot to fill space, including the cover, with a beautiful model. The first issue, released in 1964, entailed a cover featuring Babette March and a five-page layout. Campbell soon became a powerful figure in modeling and molded the issue into a media phenomenon by featuring &quot;bigger and healthier&quot; California women and printing the names of the models with their photos, beginning a new supermodel era. In the 1950s, a few women appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, but the 1964 issue is considered to be the beginning of the current format known as the Swimsuit Issue. The issue that got the most letters was the 1978 edition. In 1997, Tyra Banks was the first black woman on the cover. Since 1997, the swimsuit issue has been a stand-alone edition, separate from the regular weekly magazine. Its best selling issue was the 25th Anniversary Issue with Kathy Ireland on the cover in 1989.

Through the years, many models, such as Cheryl Tiegs, Christie Brinkley, Paulina Porizkova, Elle Macpherson, Rachel Hunter, Rebecca Romijn, Petra Nemcova, Valeria Mazza, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Marisa Miller, Brooks Nader, and Irina Shayk have been featured on the cover. Other models within its pages, but not on its cover, include Cindy Crawford, Stephanie Seymour, Ella Halikas, Niki Taylor, Angie Everhart, and Naomi Campbell. The eight models featured on the cover of the 2006 issue were featured in a coffee-table book called &quot;Sports Illustrated: Exposure&quot;. Photographed by Raphael Mazzucco and produced by Diane Smith, the unprecedented &quot;reunion shoot&quot; featured 139 pages of previously-unpublished images. In 2006, the issue expanded publishing to handheld devices. In 2007, the swimsuit issue first became available in China.

The 2008–2013 covergirls were announced on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The 2014 and 2017 covergirls were announced on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The 2015 cover model was announced on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. MJ Day became the issue&#x27;s top editor in 2014.

The 2019 covers were exclusively announced on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; with Tyra Banks and Camille Kostek both appearing on the show on May 8, 2019. The 2019 issue leaned towards diversity and inclusivity with models representing different body types. It also tackled ageism, body image and the Me Too movement.

The 2020 issue was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was released on July 13, 2020. Valentina Sampaio became the swimsuit issue’s first openly transgender model in 2020. The first openly transgender covergirl for the magazine was Leyna Bloom in 2021.

In May 2022, Yumi Nu became the first plus-size model of Asian descent to be featured on the cover of the magazine. Also in May, Maye Musk became the oldest model to feature on the Swimsuit cover, appearing at 74 years old.

==Non-models in the magazine==
Female athletes have appeared in swimsuit shoots. Steffi Graf appeared in 1997. In the 2003 issue, tennis player Serena Williams and figure skater Ekaterina Gordeeva were featured inside the magazine. In 2016, UFC fighter Ronda Rousey became the first female athlete to appear on the cover. However, Anna Kournikova appeared in an inset on the 2004 cover, and had a photo spread within its pages.

In 2005, Olympic gold medalists Amanda Beard and Jennie Finch, along with Lauren Jackson and Venus Williams, were featured. Maria Sharapova appeared in an inset on the 2006 cover and had a spread inside. In spring 2006, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; chose music as the theme for the 2007 issue. Swimsuit editor Diane Smith wanted Grammy-winner Beyoncé Knowles to pose. In 2006, Beyoncé launched a swimsuit line under her House of Deréon clothing label. Beyoncé Knowles became the first singer, and first non-model non-athlete, to appear on the cover in 2007.

In 2008, NFL cheerleaders appeared for the first time. Teams include the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers, Dallas Cowboys, Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles, Atlanta Falcons, Jacksonville Jaguars, New England Patriots, Oakland Raiders, Washington Commanders and Houston Texans.

Race car driver Danica Patrick appeared in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, she was featured in a four-page spread set in Singer Island, Florida.

For the 2010 issue, four female Winter Olympians appeared in swimsuits: Clair Bidez, Lacy Schnoor, Hannah Teter, and Lindsey Vonn. They were joined by tennis player Ana Ivanovic. Australian hurdler Michelle Jenneke appeared in the 2013 issue after having gained notoriety for her warm-up dance routine, which went viral on YouTube.

In 2012, Alex Morgan first appeared in a body paint swimsuit. In 2014, she made her second appearance this time in an actual swimsuit. In 2019, she appeared for her third appearance alongside her USWNT teammates, Megan Rapinoe, Crystal Dunn and Abby Dahlkemper all joined her in two-piece swimsuits.

Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki appeared in the 2015 issue. She is an active player, formerly world number one, and was photographed at Captiva Island in the Gulf of Mexico by Walter Iooss, Jr. Top ranked Canadian tennis player Eugenie Bouchard appeared for the first time in the 2017 issue. She is an active player who has achieved a top five rank in tennis in 2014.

In 2021, Naomi Osaka became the first black athlete to appear not only inside but also on the cover of the SI swimsuit Issue.

In 2023, Martha Stewart, at the age of 81, succeeded Maye Musk as the oldest model on the cover of the SI swimsuit Issue. Also in 2023, Kim Petras became the second openly transgender woman to appear on the cover.

Olivia Dunne, the NCAA gymnast, appeared in the ‘23 edition. Also, Olympic medallists Simone Biles and Aly Raisman in ‘17 and ‘18.

The 2024 60th Anniversary publication included reappearances by athletes Paige Spiranac, Sue Bird, Megan Rapinoe, Olivia Dunne, and Brenna Huckaby. Olympian rugby player Ilona Maher, collegiate diver Alexa Massari, collegiate softball player Jas Williams, and collegiate basketball player Jillian Hayes all made their debut in the issue as well.

==Reception==

To some people, the magazine is an acceptable exhibition of female sexuality not out of place on a coffee table. The swimsuit edition is controversial both with moralists who subscribe for sports news content as well as with those who feel that the focus on fashion and swimsuit modeling is inappropriate for a sports magazine. Feminists have expressed that &quot;the Swimsuit Issue promotes the harmful and dehumanizing concept that women are a product for male consumption&quot;.

In 1997, sports sociologist Laurel R. Davis published &quot;The Swimsuit Issue and Sport: Hegemonic Masculinity&quot; in Sports Illustrated, examining the societal implications of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Davis analyzed editions of the magazine from its inception in 1964 through the 1990s and conducted interviews with producers and readers. Her research suggested that the swimsuit issues reinforced traditional gender roles and perpetuated a &quot;climate of hegemonic masculinity.&quot; Davis also argued that the magazine marginalized people of color, non-heterosexual individuals, and residents of lower-income countries. Additionally, Davis critiqued the magazine’s portrayal of models, suggesting it emphasized notions of femininity over athleticism by depicting them as dependent, emotionally vulnerable, and disconnected from the sporting context. 

At times, subscriptions have been cancelled by subscribers. The 1978 edition, remembered for its fishnet bathing suit made famous by Cheryl Tiegs, resulted in 340 cancellations. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; makes the controversy a form of entertainment with the issue two weeks after the swimsuit edition packed with complainants such as shocked parents and troubled librarians. As of 2005, the number of cancellations has reportedly declined. Nonetheless, to avoid controversy, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has, since 2007, offered its subscribers the option of skipping the swimsuit edition for a one issue credit to extend their subscription.

<text>Belfast South was a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons.

Further to the completion of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat would be replaced by Belfast South and Mid Down, to be first contested at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

==Boundaries==

1885–1918: In the Borough of Belfast, that part of Cromac ward not in the constituency of Belfast East, that part of St. George&#x27;s ward not in the constituency of Belfast West, and the townlands of Malone Lower and that part of Malone Upper within the parliamentary borough in the parish of Shankill.

1922–1974: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Cromac, Ormeau, and Windsor.

1974–1983: The County Borough of Belfast wards of Cromac, Ormeau, and Windsor, the District of Lisburn electoral divisions of Ardmore, Dunmurry, Finaghy, and Upper Malone, and the Rural District of Hillsborough electoral divisions of Breda and Edenderry.

1983–1997: The District of Belfast wards of Ballynafeigh, Cromac, Donegall, Finaghy, Malone, Ormeau, Rosetta, St George&#x27;s, Stranmillis, University, Upper Malone, Willowfield, and Windsor.

1997–2010: The District of Belfast wards of Ballynafeigh, Blackstaff, Botanic, Finaghy, Malone, Musgrave, Ravenhill, Rosetta, Shaftesbury, Stranmillis, Upper Malone, Windsor, and Woodstock, and the District of Castlereagh wards of Beechill, Cairnshill, Galwally, Knockbracken, Minnowburn, and Newtownbreda.

2010–2024: The District of Belfast wards above and the District of Castlereagh wards as above plus Carryduff East, Carryduff West, Hillfoot, and Wynchurch.

The seat was created in 1922 when, as part of the establishment of the devolved Stormont Parliament for Northern Ireland, the number of MPs in the Westminster Parliament was drastically cut. The seat is centred on the Belfast City Council districts of Balmoral, Laganbank and Pottinger and also contains part of the district of Castlereagh.

Prior to the 2010 general election, the Boundary Commission proposed expanding Belfast South further into Castlereagh, taking in areas currently contained in both Strangford and Belfast East. This was strongly opposed by the DUP but supported by the Ulster Unionists. It was also one of the issues that generated the most negative comments in the written submissions with a petition representing half of Cregagh&#x27;s residents opposing its move.

Following the local enquiries, the Boundary Commission proposed retaining the Cregagh ward in East Belfast while transferring instead the Hillfoot ward. These proposals were submitted as final recommendations and were put into force through the passing of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order in 2008.

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Belfast South tended to elect &#x27;rebel unionists&#x27; such as William Johnston, who famously defied a ban on Orange marches, and Thomas Sloan, founder of the Independent Orange Order.

Belfast South contains some of Belfast&#x27;s most expensive residential districts as well as Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. The overall tenor of the constituency is middle-class – young, trendy and cosmopolitan towards the city centre, with Northern Ireland&#x27;s biggest concentrations of both students and ethnic minorities, and further out from the city centre it is settled and prosperous. Despite this, significant pockets of inner-city working class areas such as the Markets and a number of isolated suburban estates exist in the constituency.

There has been particularly rapid demographic change in Belfast South since around the year 2000. The 2011 census revealed that Belfast South consists of a slightly larger Catholic population than Protestant and while the constituency traditionally has had a unionist majority, the nationalist vote has now surpassed this in more recent elections. There have also been strong votes for other parties such as the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, Green Party, the Conservatives and the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition. The constituency has witnessed a steady series of candidates backed by groups who aspire to support the British Labour Party despite its prior ban on membership and organisation in Northern Ireland, though their results have been minimal. Until the 1990s the main focus of attention had been on contests between unionist candidates.

In the February 1974 general election the seat was won by Robert Bradford of the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party on a united anti-Sunningdale Agreement slate with the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party. He defeated Rafton Pounder, the sitting Unionist MP who defended his seat as a Pro-Assembly Unionist. Bradford held the seat for the next seven years, though in February 1978 he and the rump of Vanguard reunited with the Ulster Unionists. At the end of 1981 Bradford was assassinated by the IRA in a Belfast community centre while hosting a political surgery.

The subsequent by-election garnered much interest as it was expected that the Democratic Unionist Party would take the seat, building on their steady rise which had seen them gain both Belfast North and Belfast East at the previous general election. However, the DUP came third, behind the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and the UUP&#x27;s candidate Martin Smyth won the seat, holding it until 2005. The by-election was extremely significant at the time in that it was the first at which the DUP tide ebbed.

In January 2005 Smyth announced that he would be retiring at the 2005 general election, raising speculation both as to whom the Ulster Unionists would field in succession to him and what effect a different candidate would have upon their share of the vote. The UUP selected Assembly member Michael McGimpsey, albeit with a highly controversial and bitter selection. McGimpsey was repudiated by many prominent Unionists, including both Smyth and former UUP leader James Molyneaux. The DUP selected Jimmy Spratt and offered an electoral pact to the UUP that would give each party a free run at one out of South Belfast and Fermanagh and South Tyrone. This offer was rejected by the UUP.

In the event, the DUP and UUP both fielded candidates which split the vote. The nationalist vote mainly went for the SDLP over Sinn Féin, with the result that the SDLP took the seat despite a majority of votes cast for unionist candidates.

In 2010, Sinn Féin opted not to stand against the SDLP to avoid splitting the nationalist vote. The SDLP won the seat with a majority of 6,000. This was the seat in which the Alliance Party had their second-best showing, polling 15% of the votes. Alasdair McDonnell retained the seat in May 2015, with only 24.5% of the vote, as Sinn Féin opted to stand. This is the smallest proportion of the vote a winning candidate has ever achieved in a UK general election.

In 2017 the seat was won by Emma Little-Pengelly of the DUP with Alasdair McDonnell losing his seat along with all other SDLP MPs in Northern Ireland. This was won back for the SDLP by Claire Hanna in 2019, with Sinn Féin again opting not to stand. This was the first time since 1987 that the winning candidate in the constituency had a majority of the vote.

==Members of parliament==
The member of parliament since the 2019 general election is Claire Hanna of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, succeeding Emma Little-Pengelly of the Democratic Unionist Party.

==Election results==
===Elections in the 2010s===

<text>Eise Jeltes Eisinga (21 February 1744 – 27 August 1828) was a Frisian amateur astronomer who built the Eise Eisinga Planetarium in his house in Franeker, Dutch Republic. The orrery still exists and is the oldest functioning planetarium in the world.

==Biography==
Eise Jeltes Eisinga was born on 21 February 1744 in Dronryp in the Dutch Republic. He was the son of Jelte Eises from Easterlittens, a wool carder, and Hitje Steffens from Winsum.

Although Eisinga was intellectually gifted, he was not allowed to go to school. When he was only 17 years old, he wrote a book about mathematics and another about the principles of astronomy. Additional books about special subjects within the field of astronomy followed. Eisinga became a wool carder in Franeker, Netherlands. Through self-education he mastered mathematics and astronomy, which he also studied at the University of Franeker. At the age of 24, he married Pietje Jacobs (1748 – 18 July 1788) and they had three children, one girl and two boys.
* Trijntje (April 1773 – 26 April 1773)
* Jelte (29 May 1774 – 31 March 1809)
* Jacobus (17 March 1784 – 24 March 1858)

Due to a political crisis in 1787, Eisinga had to leave Friesland and went to Germany. Later he moved to Visvliet where he worked as a wool carder. He was banned from Friesland for five years and therefore stayed in Visvliet just across the border in Groningen. Meanwhile, his wife died, and on 27 May 1792, he married Trijntje Eelkes Sikkema (21 February 1764) in Visvliet. They had one son and two daughters.
* Eelke (14 October 1793 – 28 May 1795)
* Hittje (16 February 1796 – 8 May 1843)
* Minke (4 June 1798 – 17 July 1870)
In 1795 he returned to Franeker.

Eisinga remained a wool carder throughout his life, while running his planetarium with the help of public support, and occasionally guest lecturing at the University of Franeker, which Napoleon ordered closed in 1811.

Eisinga died on 27 August 1828, at age 84, in Franeker.

==Orrery==

On 8 May 1774 a conjunction of the moon and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter was forecast to appear. Reverend Eelco Alta, from Boazum, Netherlands, published a book in which he interpreted this as a return to the state of the planets at the day of creation and a likely occasion for Armageddon. Alta predicted that the planets and the moon would collide, with the result that the earth would be pushed out of its orbit and burned by the sun. Due to this prediction there was a lot of panic in Friesland.

The canonical view holds that Eisinga decided to build an orrery in his living room to prove that there was no reason for panic. He expected to finish it within six months and eventually finished it in 1781, seven years after he started. During the same year, Uranus was discovered, but there was no room for this planet on the ceiling of his living room, where the orrery was located. However, recent research indicates that this chain of causality is dubious, not least because Eijsinga appears to have commenced construction &quot;before&quot; the publication of Alta&#x27;s book. The construction of the orrery saved Eijsinga a lot of time, however, because he no longer needed to calculate the planets&#x27; respective positions by hand.

On 30 June 1818, King William I of the Netherlands and Prince Frederik visited the orrery. King William I bought the orrery for the Dutch state. In 1859, the orrery was donated by the Dutch state to the city of Franeker.

==Recognition==
Eisinga was rewarded by becoming an honorary citizen of Franeker. The street of his planetarium was renamed &quot;Eise Eisingastraat&quot;. On 5 May 1994 an 80-cent stamp was issued by the post office to celebrate his 250th birthday. In 2006 the planetarium was given permission to use the title &quot;royal&quot;. Eisinga was also included in the Canon of the Netherlands and the Canon of Friesland, which are taught in schools in the Netherlands and the province of Friesland, respectively.

<text>A beef tenderloin (US English), known as an eye fillet in Australasia, nautalund in Iceland, filetto in Italy, filet in France, filet mignon in Brazil, and fillet in the United Kingdom and South Africa, is cut from the loin of beef.

==Description==
As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the psoas major muscle ventral to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, near the kidneys.

The tenderloin is an oblong shape spanning two primal cuts: the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries) and the sirloin (called the rump in Commonwealth countries). The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the &quot;tail&quot;. The smaller, pointed end—the &quot;tail&quot;—starts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the &quot;sirloin&quot; primal cut, which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the tenderest part of the beef.

==Processing and preparation==

Whole tenderloins are sold as either &quot;unpeeled&quot; (meaning the fat and silver skin remain), &quot;peeled&quot; (meaning that the fat is removed, but silver skin remains), or as PSMOs (&quot;pismos&quot;), which is short for &quot;peeled, side muscle on&quot; (side muscle refers to the &quot;chain&quot;). Since it is the most tender part of the animal, beef dishes requiring exceptionally tender meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin.

==Cuts==
The three main &quot;cuts&quot; of the tenderloin are the butt, the center cut, and the tail. 

The butt end is usually suitable for carpaccio, as the eye can be quite large; cutting a whole tenderloin into steaks of equal weight will yield proportionally very thin steaks from the butt end. 

The center cut is suitable for portion-controlled steaks, as the diameter of the eye remains relatively consistent. The center cut can yield the traditional filet mignon or tenderloin steak, as well as the Chateaubriand and Beef Wellington. 

The tail, which is generally unsuitable for steaks due to size inconsistency, can be used for Tournedos, rounds too small to serve as an individual filet mignon-sized entre, typically plated as a pair and often cooked with bacon or lard for added richness, or used in recipes where small pieces of a tender cut are called for.

<text>Frederick Hanley Seares (May 17, 1873 – July 20, 1964) was an American astronomer. He worked at Mount Wilson Observatory and won the Bruce Medal in 1940. 

Seares was born in Michigan in 1873 and grew up in Iowa and southern California. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of California and later studied in Paris and Berlin. Later Seares taught and researched comets and variable stars for eight years at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri (where Harlow Shapley studied under him). In 1909, Seares joined the Mount Wilson Observatory, where he remained for 36 years, 15 of them as assistant director.

Seares was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1917 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1919. He served as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1929.

Seares used astrophotography as part of Jacobus Kapteyn&#x27;s effort to uncover the structure of the sidereal universe through research of &quot;selected areas.&quot; Seares standardized the stellar magnitude system and extended it beyond the 18th magnitude, using absorbing wire gauze screens and reduced apertures to compare stars of varying brightnesses. Seares also made contributions to the measurement and interpretation of stellar color indices and wrote on the brightness of the Milky Way compared to spiral nebulae, which were hypothesized (but not yet fully established) to be other galaxies.

Seares also studied interstellar absorption and reddening of starlight.

Seares died in 1964. The crater Seares on the Moon is named after him.

<text>Birdwell, makers of Birdwell Beach Britches, is an American surf clothing company headquartered in Santa Ana, California. Founded by Carrie Birdwell Mann in 1961, the company manufactures and sells customized heavy-duty swimsuits, which are sold internationally. With four basic models, various fabrics, including Surfnyl, Tactel, heavy nylon, sailcloth, and canvas, more than 40 colors, and various other options, the combinations that can be created are nearly endless. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Quality is our Gimmick.&quot; The motto was coined by Surfer Magazine publisher, Steve Pezman.

The swimsuits themselves, which resemble board shorts, are paneled swimsuits, with waistbands resembling those of boxing trunks, always double-stitched, always with two layers of fabric. These shorts are known and favored among surfers, lifeguards, and paddleboarders, because of their quick-drying design and extreme durability; with an estimated 10 years for average use, and 2–5 for more strenuous use. Their core nylon shorts made from their &quot;Surfnyl™&quot; blend are made in USA and have been since 1961.

On all of the trunks there is a logo, of a stylized anthropomorphic surfboard, wearing, of course, Birdwell Beach Britches, nicknamed &quot;Birdie&quot;.

The company has grown to develop a full line of apparel for four seasons, including pants, shorts, sweatshirts, and its iconic jackets made from Surfnyl™, its proprietary nylon blend.

<text>Alfred Harrison Joy (September 23, 1882 in Greenville, Illinois – April 18, 1973 in Pasadena, California) was an astronomer best known for his work on stellar distances, the radial motion of stars, and variable stars.

A crater on the Moon has been named in his honor.

==Early years==
He was born in Greenville, Illinois, the son of F.P. Joy, a prominent clothing merchant in Greenville and one-time mayor of the town. He received a BA from Greenville College in 1903 and an MA from Oberlin College the next year.

==Career==
After graduating, Joy went on to work at the American University of Beirut in the Syrian Protestant College as a professor of astronomy and the director of the observatory. He was forced to return to the U.S. in 1915 because of World War I.

In the United States, he worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory from 1915 to 1952. There, he and his colleagues ascertained the spectral type, absolute magnitude, and stellar distance of over 5,000 stars. Joy also initially defined the T-Tauri type star. He studied the Doppler displacement of the spectral lines of stars to determine their radial velocities deducing a star&#x27;s absolute dimensions, masses, and the orbital elements of some specific stars. He won the Bruce Medal in 1950.

He was president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1931 and 1939.

Born in Vienna to a Jewish family, Salpeter emigrated from Austria to Australia while in his teens to escape the Nazis. He attended Sydney Boys High School (1939–40) and Sydney University, where he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1944 and his master&#x27;s degree in 1945. In the same year he was awarded an overseas scholarship and attended the University of Birmingham, England, where he earned his doctorate in 1948 under the supervision of Sir Rudolf Peierls. He spent the remainder of his career at Cornell University, where he was the James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor of the Physical Sciences. Salpeter died of leukemia at his home in Ithaca, New York on 26 November 2008.

==Scientific contributions==
In 1951 Salpeter suggested that stars could burn helium-4 into carbon-12 with the Triple-alpha process not directly, but through an intermediate metastable state of beryllium-8, which helped to explain the carbon production in stars. He later derived the initial mass function for the formation rates of stars of different mass in the Galaxy.

Salpeter wrote with Hans Bethe two articles in 1951 which introduced the equation bearing their names, the Bethe–Salpeter equation which describes the interactions between a pair of fundamental particles under a quantum field theory.

In 1955 he found the Salpeter function or the initial mass function (IMF). It shows that the number of stars in each mass range decreases rapidly with increasing mass.

In 1964 Salpeter and independently Yakov B. Zel&#x27;dovich were the first to suggest that accretion discs around massive black holes are responsible for the huge amounts of energy radiated by quasars (which are the brightest active galactic nuclei). This is currently the most accepted explanation for the physical origin of active galactic nuclei and the associated extragalactic relativistic jets.

In early 1970s, Salpeter discovered that molecular hydrogen and many other molecular species are formed in the interstellar medium not as much in the gas phase but primarily on the surfaces of dust particles.

==Family==
In 1950 he married Miriam (Mika) Mark (1929–2000), a neurobiologist born in Riga, Latvia; she was chairwoman of the department of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell from 1982 to 1988. The Society for Neuroscience created the Mika Salpeter award in her memory; it &quot;recognizes an individual with outstanding career achievements in neuroscience who has also significantly promoted the professional advancement of women in neuroscience.&quot; The Salpeters had two daughters, Judy Salpeter and Dr. Shelley Salpeter.
After Miriam&#x27;s death, Edwin married Antonia Shouse.

<text>Irish folklore () refers to the folktales, balladry, music, dance and mythology of Ireland. It is the study and appreciation of how people lived.

The folklore of Ireland includes banshees, fairies, leprechauns and other mythological creatures, and was typically shared orally by people gathering around, sharing stories. Many tales and legends were passed from generation to generation, so were the dances and song in the observing of important occasions such as weddings, wakes, birthdays and holidays or, handcraft traditions.

==Definition==
What constitutes Irish folklore may be rather fuzzy to those unfamiliar with Irish literature. Diarmuid Ó Giolláin, for one, declared that folklore was elusive to define clearly.

Bo Almqvist (c. 1977) gave an all-encompassing definition that folklore covered &quot;the totality of folk culture, spiritual and material&quot;, and included anything mentioned in Seán Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s &quot;A Handbook of Irish Folklore&quot; (1942).

It was not until 1846 that the word &quot;folklore&quot; was coined, by English writer William Thoms, to designate &quot;the manners, customs, observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, &amp;c of the olden time&quot;. The term was first translated into Irish as &quot;béaloideas&quot; (lit. &#x27;oral instruction&#x27;) in 1927.

===Folktales and songs===
Tales have been traditionally recounted in fireside gatherings, such social gatherings, in which traditional Irish music and dance are also performed, are labeled by some as the , though this is a term borrowed from Scottish Gaelic. The story-telling, songs and dance were also part of how special occasions were commemorated, on such days as Christmas, Halloween (, eve of Samhain), Bealtaine, held on the first day of May, or St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Irish folklore is closely tied with the pipe and fiddle, the traditional Irish music and folk dance.

The keening composed by Eileen Dubh Ní Chonaill in her husband&#x27;s wake is a piece of poetry passed down by folk tradition.

Other than folktales and legends, the folkloristic genres is complemented by memorates, beliefs, and belief statements.

===Handcraft and herb lore===
Also part of Irish folklore are the handed-down skills, such as basket-weaving or making Brigid&#x27;s crosses.

As an example, shallow wicker baskets called &quot;skeeoges&quot; as strainers (to empty the boiled potatoes and hot water on, to drain the liquid) were recorded in the Co. Wexford area by Patrick Kennedy in the 19th century. A later folklore collector was unable to ascertain whether this practice was carried out in the locality during the field work in the 1950s (or in the revisit in 1970&#x27;s). This basket&#x27;s name &quot;skeeoge&quot; supposedly derived from the Gaelic word for &quot;shield&quot; ().

The Irish Folklore Commission has accumulated a collection of crosses made on St. Bridget&#x27;s Day (1 February), and various craft objects made of plaited straw, etc., gathered from across the county.

Folklore can also include knowledge and skills such as , or to treat an illness, i.e., herb lore.

==Common themes==
There are certain stock motifs, often stereotypes, in Irish folklore.

===Fairies===
One commentator attributes to Andrew Lang the sweeping definition that Irish folklore is all about fairies. The belief in fairies () has been widespread.

Some, such as Irish poet W. B. Yeats, have divided the fairies into multiple categories and/or species (see Classifications of fairies). However, Irish fairies are typically divided into two main categories: the fairy race and the solitary fairies.

The race of fairy people () were thought to be descendants of the Tuatha Dé Danann, a godlike race who came to Ireland and conquered the people there. They are described as human sized, beautiful, powerful, and in tune with nature, similar to the modern day fantasy race of Elves.

Instead of living together like the elite fairy race, solitary fairies are secretive and isolated, often staying away from humans and coming out at night. The solitary fairies include a wide range of magical creatures in Irish folklore.

One type of Irish fairy is the female &quot;banshee&quot;, the death-messenger with her keening, or baleful crying over someone&#x27;s death, and known by many different names.

Another well-recognized Irish fairy is the leprechaun, which many have identified as the maker of shoes. The cluricaune is a sprite many treat as synonymous to the leprechaun, and Yeats muses on whether these and the far darrig (fear dearg, &quot;red man&quot;) are the one and the same. Mackillop says these three are the three kinds solitary fairies, but Yeats goes on to say &quot;there are other solitary fairies&quot;, naming the Dullahan (headless horsemen), Púca, and so forth.

The changeling is often ascribed to being perpetrated by fairies. The theme is assigned its own migratory legend type, &quot;The Changeling&quot; (ML 5085).

===Fairy land===
Fairies are also connected with the Irish traditional belief in the Otherworld ().

Fairy forts and hawthorn trees, also known as fairy trees, are places where fairies are thought to reside. Thus, to tamper with these sites is seen as hugely disrespectful to the fairies.

====Hawthorn tree====
There are several trees sacred to Ireland, but the lone hawthorn (aka the &quot;may&quot; tree) is particularly considered a fairy haunt, and patches underneath where the grass have worn down are reputed to be due to fairies dancing. Though literary fiction more than folklore, two consecutive poems by Samuel Ferguson, &quot;The Fairy Thorn&quot; and &quot;The Fairy Well of Lagnanay&quot; describes the lone Fairy Hawthorn (The Whitethorn).

====Fairy mounds====
The notion that Irish fairies live in fairy mounds (fairy forts, fairy hills) give rise to the names or (&#x27;people of the [fairy mound]&#x27;).

In the instance of &quot;The Legend of Knockgrafton&quot; (name of a hill), the protagonist named Lusmore is carried inside the fairy &quot;moat&quot; or rath by the fairy wind ().

===Heroic sagas===
Other classic themes in Irish folktale literature include Cú Chulainn, Children of Lir, Fionn Mac Cumhail, from medieval heroic and tragic sagas.

Folklore material in the &#x27;Pre-Croker period&#x27;, according to Bo Almqvist&#x27;s reckoning, do tentatively include various Medieval written texts (the heroic tales in the Ulster Cycle, Finn Cycle, the Cycle of the Kings, and the hagiography of St. Patrick and other saints, etc.), with the proviso that these works can no longer be considered intact folk legends, given the accrued literary layers of the &quot;fanciful and fantastic&quot;. However they are an excellent well-source of comparative study, as collected folktales are sometimes traceable to these medieval sagas. An example is the tale of Cú Chulainn&#x27;s horse remnant in the legend type of &quot;The Waterhorse as Workhorse&quot; (MLSIT 4086), or so argued by C. W. von Sydow.

In the 20th century, the Irish Folklore Commission collected a large corpus of such romantic heroic sagas, particularly the stories of Fionn Mac Cumhail and the Fianna.

==History of collecting==
===Early collectors===
For most of the 19th century, collection of Irish folklore was undertaken by English-speakers, and the material collected were recorded only in English.

Thomas Crofton Croker who compiled &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland&quot; (1825–28) is considered one of the earliest collectors. Croker is the first among the significant &quot;antiquary-folklorists&quot; (the label applied by Richard Dorson) to emerge from mere antiquarians.

=== Tales in the Irish language ===
The Irish-speaking West, the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; included for example the Aran Islands, where some folklore-collecting was performed by Danish linguist Holger Pedersen back in 1896, though the resulting collection was never published until a century later. The playwright J. M. Synge also included a couple of folktales in his &quot;The Aran Islands&quot; (1907).

===Irish Folklore Commission===

Séamus Ó Duilearga (James Hamilton Delargy), who founded the Folklore of Ireland Society and its &quot;Béaloideas&quot; magazine in 1927, was later appointed to head the Irish Folklore Commission (IFC) in established by the Irish government in 1935. Seán Ó Súilleabháin was the archivist for the IFC since its inception. After having undergone 3 month tutelage in Uppsala, Sweden under C. W. von Sydow on the methods of folklore archiving, the archivist became instrumental in establishing collecting policies for the IFC. One of Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s projects was the Schools&#x27; Scheme for primary school children to collect folklore (1937-1938). IFC established a network of 200 or 300 correspondents all over Ireland to whom long questionnaires were sent out to task them with particular areas of folklore collecting.

Ó Súilleabháin soon compiled a how-tow guidebook for folklore-collecting fieldwork, entitled &quot;Láimh-Leabhar Béaloideasa&quot; (1937) in Irish, later expanded and published in English as &quot;A Handbook of Irish Folklore&quot; (1942). The methodology was based on the Uppsala system he studied, and the books became the standard bible for any Irish folklore collector.

===Folktale classification===
An effort to catalogue all the known international folk tales in Ireland, either in print or in oral circulation (as of 1956) was mounted by Seán Ó Súilleabháin and Reidar Thoralf Christiansen, culminating in &quot;The Types of the Irish Folktale&quot; (1963), a compilation of some 43,000 versions under 700 international tales.

Christiansen was the creator of the index of Norwegian migratory legends (ML index), and Bo Almqvist adapted this for Irish legends, calling it MLSIT (for Migratory Legend Suggested Irish Type). Although &quot;The Types of the Irish Folktale&quot; purportedly deals with folktale but not folk legend, there are found to be some intersections between these comparative study apparatuses.

==Sociological trends==
Folklore is a part of national identity, and its meaning has evolved through time.

===Irish identity===
In Ireland the word &quot;folklore&quot; has deep meaning to its people and brings societies together, it is a word that has ideological significance in the country. To put it succinctly, folklore is an important part of the national identity.

===Effects of Christianity on Irish folklore===
When Christianity was first brought in Ireland during the 5th century by missionaries, they were not able to totally wipe out the pre-existing folklore and beliefs in God-like fairies. But folklore did not remain untouched, and the myths and Christian beliefs were combined such that Irish folklore would &quot;enforce Christian ideals but still remain as a concession to early fairy belief systems&quot;. Christianity altered the importance of some beliefs and define a new place for them in folklore. For example, fairies, who were previously perceived as God, became merely magical, and of much lesser importance. Along with it, a fusion of folklore legends and Christianity was witnessed. One of the major example of this is the existence of legends featuring both Saint Patrick, a central figure in the Irish church, and fairies (for example, &quot;The Colloquy of the Ancients&quot; is a dialogue between Saint Patrick and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, an ancient clan of Celtic warriors).

All in all, the current Irish folklore shows a strong absorption of Christianity, including its lesson of morality and spiritual beliefs, creating a &quot;singular brand of fairy tale tradition&quot;.

===English colonization===
During the 16th century, the English conquest overthrew the traditional political and religious autonomy of the country.

===Great Famine===
The Great famine of the 1840s, and the deaths and emigration it brought, weakened a still powerful Gaelic culture, especially within the rural proletariat, which was at the time the most traditional social grouping. At the time, intellectuals such as Sir William Wilde expressed concerns on the decay of traditional beliefs:

===Modern society===
Moreover, global migration has helped overcoming special spatial barriers making it easier for cultures to merge into one another (such as the amalgam between Samhain and Halloween).

All those events have led to a massive decline of native learned Gaelic traditions and Irish language, and with Irish tradition being mainly an oral tradition, this has led to a loss of identity and historical continuity, in a similar nature to Durkheim&#x27;s anomie.

==Folk history==
Irish folklore is replete with oral traditions that pertain to historical subjects. This was recognised in Seán Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s A &quot;Handbook of Irish Folklore&quot;, which includes a chapter specifically dedicated to collecting &quot;Historical Tradition&quot;. Irish folk history was commonly known by the name , a term defined by Séamus Ó Duilearga as &quot;orally preserved social-historical tradition.&quot; When conducting fieldwork in county Fermanagh, the American folklorist Henry Glassie, a pioneer in the study of folk history, observed that in Irish storytelling &quot;history is a topic for conversation&quot;. In his prize-winning works on the memory of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, the Israeli historian Guy Beiner has written in-depth case studies of folk history, powerfully demonstrating the value of folklore for the study of social and cultural history. Beiner has advocated for use of the term &quot;vernacular historiography&quot;, which he argues &quot;consciously steers clear of the artificial divides between oral and literary cultures that lie at the heart of conceptualizations of oral tradition&quot; and also allows for the inclusion of folklife sources found in ethnological studies of material and visual culture.

==In popular culture==
Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko has referred to the re-contexted exploitation of folklore as its &quot;second life&quot;. Irish folklore material is now being used in marketing (with strategies suggesting tradition and authenticity for goods), movies and TV shows (&quot;The Secret of Kells&quot;, mention of the Banshee are found in TV shows such as &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; or &quot;Charmed&quot;), books (the book series &quot;The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel,&quot; the novel &quot;American Gods&quot;...), contributing to the creation of a new body of Irish folklore.

<text>Shenwa, also spelt Chenoua (native name: &quot;Haqbaylit̠&quot;), is a Zenati Berber language spoken on Mount Chenoua (Jebel Chenoua) in Algeria, just west of Algiers, and in the provinces of Tipaza (including the town of Cherchell) and Chlef. The speech of Jebel Chenoua proper is mutually comprehensible with that of the nearby Beni Menacer and Beni Haoua, and they are thus treated as a single language. There are some 76,000 speakers.

==Phonology==
Judging by Laoust (whose work on the language predates systematic phonology), Shenwa has the following sounds, which are given below in the International Phonetic Alphabet along with differing representations in the Algerian standard Latin orthography for Berber languages in angle brackets :

===Consonants===
Comparison with other Berber languages suggests that Laoust&#x27;s transcription may have failed to distinguish certain sounds, notably pharyngealized .

===Vowels===

 . Laoust&#x27;s appears to variously indicate labialization () or an allophone of /u/.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

Masculine nouns start with &quot;a-, i-, u-&quot; (in the singular) – like all Berber languages – or more rarely with a consonant (often corresponding to &quot;a-&quot; in other languages.) Examples: &quot;ayḏi&quot; &quot;dog&quot;; &quot;fus&quot; &quot;hand&quot;; &quot;iri&quot; &quot;neck&quot;; &quot;urṯu&quot; &quot;garden&quot;. Their plural is usually in &quot;i-...-en&quot; (e.g. &quot;ameţin&quot; &quot;death&quot; → &quot;imeţinen&quot;), but a variety of other plural forms (e.g. &quot;i-...-an&quot;, &quot;i-...-wen&quot;, &quot;i-...awen&quot;, &quot;i-...-en&quot;, &quot;i-...-a-&quot;), sometimes accompanied by internal ablaut, are also found: e.g. &quot;ijiḏer&quot; &quot;eagle&quot; → &quot;ijuḏar&quot;, &quot;iṯri&quot; &quot;star&quot; → &quot;iṯran&quot;, &quot;afer&quot; &quot;wing&quot; → &quot;ifrawen&quot;, &quot;icer&quot; &quot;fingernail&quot; → &quot;icaren&quot;.

Feminine nouns start with &quot;h-&quot; (originally &quot;t-&quot;), and usually end with &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-ṯ&quot;: &quot;hagmarṯ&quot; &quot;mare&quot;, &quot;hesa&quot; &quot;liver&quot;. A few feminine nouns have lost the &quot;h-&quot;: &quot;malla&quot; &quot;turtledove&quot;. A masculine noun can be made diminutive by adding the feminine affixes: &quot;afus&quot; &quot;hand&quot; → &quot;hafust&quot; &quot;little hand&quot;. The plurals of feminine nouns fall into much the same types as masculine ones, but adding &quot;h-&quot; at the beginning and using &quot;-in&quot; rather than &quot;-en&quot;: &quot;hakṯemţ&quot; &quot;female&quot; → &quot;hikṯemin&quot;, &quot;harract&quot; &quot;girl&quot; → &quot;harracin&quot;, &quot;huqiṯ&quot; &quot;stone&quot; → &quot;huqay&quot;, &quot;hawleliṯ&quot; &quot;spider&quot; → &quot;hiwlela&quot;.

Genitive constructions – English &quot;X of Y&quot; or &quot;Y&#x27;s X&quot; – are formed as &quot;X Y&quot;, in which the prefix of Y changes to &quot;u-&quot; (masc.) or &quot;n ţe-&quot; (fem.). Thus, for instance: &quot;aman n ţala&quot; &quot;the water of the fountain&quot;, &quot;aglim uγilas&quot; &quot;the skin of the panther&quot;. &quot;n&quot; &quot;of&quot; is also used with foreign words: &quot;hagmarṯ n elqayd̠&quot; &quot;the mare of the Caid&quot;.

===Adjectives===

Adjectives agree in number and gender with the noun, and are formed in the same way: e.g. &quot;amellal&quot; &quot;white&quot;, &quot;azegrar&quot; &quot;long&quot;, &quot;azaim&quot; &quot;good&quot;. The particle &quot;d̠&quot; is used before adjectives in certain contexts (including as a copula), in the same way as in the Kabyle language.

===Numbers===
As in Kabyle, only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, Arabic is used. They are &quot;iğ&quot; (f. &quot;ict&quot;) &quot;one&quot;, &quot;sen&quot; (f. &quot;senat̠&quot;) &quot;two&quot;. The noun being counted follows it in the genitive: &quot;senat̠ n ţuwura&quot; &quot;two doors&quot;.

&quot;First&quot; and &quot;last&quot; are respectively &quot;amezgaru&quot; and &quot;aneggaru&quot; (regular adjectives). Other ordinals are formed with the prefix &quot;wis&quot; (f. &quot;his&quot;): &quot;wis sen&quot; &quot;second (m.)&quot;, &quot;his t̠elat̠a&quot; &quot;third (f.)&quot;, etc.

===Pronouns===
The basic personal pronouns of Shenwa are as follows. Gender is distinguished in all cases except the first person.

The basic demonstrative adjectives are &quot;-a&quot; &quot;this&quot; (also &quot;-ay, -ad̠&quot;; &quot;-ax&quot; for middle distance), &quot;-in&quot; &quot;that&quot;, &quot;-enni&quot; &quot;the aforementioned&quot;. The demonstrative pronouns include:

*&quot;this&quot;: &quot;wa&quot; m. sg., &quot;hax&quot; f. sg., &quot;yid̠a&quot; m. pl., &quot;hid̠a&quot; f. pl.
*&quot;this&quot; (emphatic): &quot;wayek&quot;, &quot;hayek&quot;, &quot;id̠ad̠ik&quot;, &quot;hid̠ad̠ik&quot;
*&quot;this&quot; (in question): &quot;wenni&quot;, &quot;henni&quot;, &quot;id̠enni&quot;, &quot;hid̠enni&quot;
*&quot;that&quot;: &quot;win&quot;, &quot;hin&quot;, &quot;yid̠in&quot;, &quot;hid̠in&quot;

The standalone possessive pronouns (&quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, etc.) are formed by suffixing the possessive pronouns to &quot;this&quot; (except that &quot;ha-&quot; is used instead of &quot;hax&quot;.) Similarly, the adjective &quot;other&quot; (invariable &quot;enniḍen&quot;) combines with &quot;this&quot; to make forms meaning &quot;the other&quot;: &quot;unniḍen&quot;, &quot;henniḍen&quot;, &quot;id̠enniḍen&quot;, &quot;hid̠enniḍin&quot;.

The main interrogative pronouns are: &quot;maţa&quot; &quot;what?&quot;, &quot;manţ&quot; &quot;which&quot;, &quot;manay&quot; &quot;who?&quot;, &quot;mi lan&quot; &quot;whose?&quot;, &quot;miked̠&quot; &quot;with whom?&quot;, &quot;mid̠eg&quot; &quot;in what?&quot;, &quot;mizeg&quot; &quot;with what?&quot;, &quot;mifeg&quot; &quot;on what?&quot;, &quot;miγer&quot; &quot;at/for whom?&quot;

The relative pronoun is &quot;i&quot; &quot;which&quot;.

Indefinite pronouns include &quot;yeğ&quot; (f. &quot;yectenţ&quot;) &quot;one, someone&quot;, &quot;cra&quot; &quot;something&quot;. Negative forms are made using the Arabic loanword &quot;haţa&quot; (حتى); &quot;haţa d̠ yeğ&quot; &quot;no one&quot;, &quot;haţa d̠ elḥabb&quot; &quot;nothing&quot;.

===Verbs===

The declarative mood is divided into two tenses: preterite (past) and aorist (non-past, formed by the addition of &quot;a-&quot;.) There is also an imperative mood. The irregular imperative &quot;ia&quot; &quot;come&quot; is used with the aorist to form imperatives of the first person: &quot;iaw annaroḥet̠&quot; &quot;let&#x27;s go&quot;. The pronoun affixes for these are given under Pronouns. The declarative mood is also accompanied by ablaut:

* Verbs whose imperative consists of two consonants or less (e.g. &quot;eğ&quot; &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;eγr&quot; &quot;read&quot;, &quot;ezr&quot; &quot;see&quot;, &quot;enγ&quot; &quot;kill&quot;) add &quot;-a&quot; to the stem in the 3rd person singulars and 1st person plural, and &quot;-i&quot; in all other forms: &quot;enγiγ&quot; &quot;I killed&quot;, &quot;henγa&quot; &quot;she killed&quot;.
*Verbs whose imperative begins with &quot;a-&quot; (e.g. &quot;adef&quot; &quot;come in&quot;, &quot;ad̠er&quot; &quot;go down&quot;, &quot;azen&quot; &quot;send&quot;) change it to &quot;u-&quot;: thus &quot;ud̠efen&quot; &quot;they came in&quot;, &quot;hud̠efed&quot; &quot;you (sg.) came in. (Verbs such as &quot;af&quot; &quot;find&quot; belong to both this and the previous group.) &quot;awi&quot; &quot;bring&quot; and &quot;awd̠&quot; &quot;arrive&quot; are exceptions, changing &quot;a-&quot; to &quot;i-&quot;: &quot;yiwi&quot; &quot;he brought&quot;.
* Verbs with &quot;-a-&quot; in the middle (e.g. &quot;laz&quot; &quot;be hungry&quot;, &quot;nam&quot; &quot;have the habit of&quot;, &quot;ğal&quot; &quot;judge&quot;) change it to &quot;-u-&quot;: &quot;elluzeγ&quot; &quot;I was hungry&quot;.
* Verbs with a final vowel usually behave like the two-consonant ones: &quot;arji&quot; &quot;dream&quot; → &quot;ourjiγ&quot; &quot;I dreamt&quot;, &quot;yurja&quot; &quot;he dreamt&quot;; &quot;egmi&quot; &quot;teach&quot; → &quot;egmiγ&quot; &quot;I taught&quot;, &quot;igma&quot; &quot;he taught&quot;. But there are exceptions: &quot;erni&quot; &quot;be born&quot; → &quot;irni&quot; &quot;he was born&quot;.

The participle is formed by adding &quot;-n&quot; to the 3rd person m. sg., sometimes with ablaut of final vowels: &quot;inziz&quot; &quot;he sang&quot; → &quot;inzizen&quot;; &quot;ayenziz&quot; &quot;he will sing&quot; → &quot;ayenzizen&quot;, &quot;yut̠a&quot; &quot;he hit&quot; → &quot;yut̠in&quot;.

The verb is negated by adding &quot;u... c&quot; around it: &quot;u ţinziz ec&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t sing&quot;, &quot;u huwired̠ ec&quot; &quot;you didn&#x27;t walk&quot;. &quot;Not yet&quot; is &quot;u rt̠uci εad̠&quot; or &quot;ur uci&quot;, where &quot;rt̠uci&quot; and &quot;uci&quot; are verbs conjugated in the appropriate person: &quot;u rt̠uciγ εad̠ u d yuḍeγ ec&quot; &quot;I haven&#x27;t arrived yet&quot;, &quot;u hert̠ucid̠ εad̠ ...&quot; &quot;you haven&#x27;t yet...&quot;

Derived verb forms include:
* a causative in &quot;s-&quot;: &quot;azeg&quot; &quot;boil&quot; → &quot;sizeg&quot; &quot;make something boil&quot;.
* a &quot;reciprocal&quot; middle voice in &quot;m-&quot;: &quot;zer&quot; &quot;see&quot; → &quot;mzer&quot; &quot;be seen&quot;
* a passive voice in &quot;ţwa-&quot;: &quot;abba&quot; &quot;carry&quot; → &quot;ţwabba&quot; &quot;be carried&quot;.
* Various habitual forms.

Continuous forms can be formed with &quot;aql-&quot; &quot;see X&quot; in the present tense, &quot;ţuγa&quot; &quot;was&quot; in the past tense: &quot;aqlay ţeţeγ&quot; &quot;I am eating&quot;, &quot;ţuγay ţeţeγ&quot;&quot;I was eating&quot;.

===Prepositions===

Prepositions precede their objects: &quot;i medden&quot; &quot;to the people&quot;, &quot;sgi Bazar&quot; &quot;from Tipaza&quot;. Some of the main ones are: &quot;i&quot; &quot;to&quot; (dative), &quot;n&quot; &quot;of&quot;, &quot;d̠eg/d̠i/eg/i&quot; &quot;in(to)&quot;, &quot;seg/zeg-/si&quot; &quot;from&quot;, &quot;s&quot; &quot;using&quot; (instrumental), &quot;f/fell-&quot; &quot;on&quot;, &quot;γer/γ&quot; &quot;towards&quot;, &quot;akid̠/d̠&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;jar&quot; &quot;among&quot;, &quot;zat̠&quot; &quot;in front of&quot;, &quot;awr&quot; &quot;behind&quot;, &quot;i sawen/susawen&quot; &quot;under&quot;, &quot;addu&quot; &quot;over&quot;.

===Conjunctions===

Conjunctions precede the verb: &quot;ami yiwoḍ &quot;&quot;when he arrived&quot;, &quot;qabel ma ţaγen&quot; &quot;see if it&#x27;s raining&quot;. Some important ones include: &quot;melmi&quot; &quot;when?&quot;, &quot;ami&quot;, &quot;γassa(l)&quot;, &quot;assγa&quot;, &quot;γir&quot; &quot;when&quot;, &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;kagella&quot;, &quot;lukan&quot;, &quot;willa&quot; &quot;if&quot;, &quot;(an)neγ&quot; &quot;or&quot;.

==Sample text==

&quot;Qaren midden: Unni ayḥağen d̠ug ass, adeffeγen arraw ennes d̠iferd̠asen.&quot;

They say: he that tells stories in the daytime, his children will turn bald.

&quot;Ţḥağen γir d̠eg iḍ&quot;

They only tell stories at night.

===Uccen aked̠ waḥzaw/The jackal and the child===

&quot;Iğ wuccen iroḥ iggur lami g ufa iğ waḥzaw iţellem i hezra. Innas uccen i warrac enni: &quot;Maţa hellid̠ hegared̠.&quot; Arrac enni innas: &quot;Ţellemeγ d̠i hezra.&quot; Innas uccen: &quot;Ad̠el ay hirkasin.&quot; Arrac enni iţxiyeḍ as iḍaren nes. Lami iqaḍa innas: &quot;Roḥ, aεd̠el iḍaren ennek̠ γer fwit̠.&quot;&quot;

&quot;Iroḥ uccen yaεd̠el iman es γer fwit̠ lami eqqoren iḍaren u iğim ec ayuwr.&quot;

&quot;Ikk ed sin iğ wumcic; innas uccen: &quot;Sellek ay u c eţţγec.&quot; Iks as umcic hazra seg ḍarennes. Iroḥ uccen iwalla γer waḥzaw ič as elkul iγeṭṭen.&quot;

A jackal went and met a child plaiting a rope. The jackal asked the child: &quot;What are you doing?&quot; This child replied: &quot;I&#x27;m plaiting a rope.&quot; The jackal said: &quot;Make me some shoes.&quot; This child tied up his feet. When he was done he told him: &quot;Go show your feet in the sun.&quot;

The jackal went and showed his own feet in the sun, and his feet dried and he couldn&#x27;t walk.

A cat arrived and the jackal told it: &quot;Help me, I won&#x27;t eat you.&quot; The cat took the rope off his feet. The jackal went back to the child, and ate all his goats.

<text>Warlpiri Sign Language, also known as Rdaka-rdaka (&quot;lit. hand signs&quot;), is a sign language used by the Warlpiri, an Aboriginal community in the central desert region of Australia. It is one of the most elaborate, and certainly the most studied, of all Australian Aboriginal sign languages.

==Social context==
While many neighbouring language groups such as Arrernte and the Western Desert Language have auxiliary sign languages, Warlpiri Sign Language, along with Warumungu Sign Language, appears to be the most well developed and widely used — it is as complete a system of communication as spoken Warlpiri. This is possibly due to the tradition that widows should not speak during an extended mourning period which can last for months or even years; during this time they communicate solely by sign language.

In Warlpiri communities, widows also tend to live away from their families, with other widows or young single women. As a result, it is typical for Warlpiri women to have a better command of the sign language than men, and among older women at Yuendumu, Warlpiri Sign Language is in constant use, whether they are under a speech ban or not. However, all members of the community understand it, and may sign in situations where speech is undesirable, such as while hunting, in private communication, across distances, while ill, or for subjects that require a special reverence or respect. Many also use signs as an accompaniment to speech.

==Linguistics==
British linguist Adam Kendon (1988) argues that Warlpiri Sign Language is best understood as a manual representation of the spoken Warlpiri language (a manually coded language), rather than as a separate language; individual signs represent morphemes from spoken Warlpiri, which are expressed in the same word order as the oral language. However, &quot;markers of case relations, tense, and cliticised pronouns are not signed.&quot; Some spatial grammatical features are present which do not exist in spoken Warlpiri, though spoken Warlpiri incorporates directionals in its verbs, and in such cases sign corresponds to speech.

<text>Donald Edward Osterbrock (July 13, 1924 – January 11, 2007) was an American astronomer, best known for his work on star formation and on the history of astronomy.

== Biography ==
Osterbrock was born in Cincinnati. His father was an electrical engineer. He served with the US Army in the Second World War, making weather observations in the Pacific. He did undergraduate classes in physics at the University of Chicago as part of his weather training.

He was educated at the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in physics and a PhD in astronomy in 1952. He was a student of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar while working at University of Chicago&#x27;s Yerkes Observatory. His work there with William Wilson Morgan and Stewart Sharpless showed the existence of the Milky Way&#x27;s spiral arms.

He became a post-doctoral researcher, instructor and assistant professor at the California Institute of Technology until 1958. He was then appointed assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, received tenure there in 1959, and was promoted to full professor in 1961. He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1960–1961. In 1973 he moved from Madison to the University of California at Santa Cruz, as Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Director of Lick Observatory, a position he held until 1981. He remained on the faculty at UC Santa Cruz until his retirement in 1993. Thereafter, Emeritus Professor Osterbrock continued to make daily trips to his office on campus, to work on his research, to keep publishing, and to maintain an active role in the astronomical community.

At the time of his death he had authored 12 monographs on astronomy and the history of astronomy, including, in 1989 the influential textbook &quot;Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei,&quot; and the recently updated and revised 2nd edition (2006) written along with Gary Ferland of the University of Kentucky. Alongside his more than 150 articles on astronomy and astrophysics, he published 70 historical studies, biographical memoirs, and obituaries of major figures in nineteenth and twentieth century astronomy, and numerous book reviews.

Osterbrock&#x27;s research included work on the nature of ionized gases around hot stars and studying active galactic nuclei powered by black holes.

Osterbrock received lifetime achievement awards from the American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was President of the American Astronomical Society from 1988 to 1990.

He died following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife of 54 years, Irene Hansen (1926-2019), and their son and two daughters.

<doc id="864778" wikidata="Q728331" url="?curid=864778" title="Jim Peebles">
<text>Phillip James Edwin Peebles (born April 25, 1935) is a Canadian-American astrophysicist, astronomer, and theoretical cosmologist who was Albert Einstein Professor in Science, emeritus, at Princeton University. He is widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s leading theoretical cosmologists in the period since 1970, with major theoretical contributions to primordial nucleosynthesis, dark matter, the cosmic microwave background, and structure formation.

Peebles was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019 for his theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology. He shared the prize with Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for their discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star. While much of his work relates to the development of the universe from its first few seconds, he is more skeptical about what we can know about the very beginning, and stated, &quot;It&#x27;s very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning.&quot;

Peebles has described himself as a convinced agnostic.

== Early life ==
Peebles was born on April 25, 1935, in St. Vital in present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the son of Ada Marion (Green), a homemaker, and Andrew Charles Peebles, who worked for the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. He completed his Bachelor of Science at the University of Manitoba. He then went on to pursue graduate studies at Princeton University, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics in 1962, completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Observational Tests and Theoretical Problems Relating to the Conjecture That the Strength of the Electromagnetic Interaction May Be Variable&quot; under the supervision of Robert Dicke. He remained at Princeton for his whole career. Peebles was a Member in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study during the academic year 1977–78; he made subsequent visits during 1990–91 and 1998–99.

==Academic career==
Most of Peebles&#x27; work since 1964 has been in the field of physical cosmology to determine the origins of the universe. In 1964, there was very little interest in this field and it was considered a &quot;dead end&quot; but Peebles remained committed to studying it. Peebles has made many important contributions to the Big Bang model. With Dicke and others (nearly two decades after George Gamow, Ralph A. Alpher and Robert C. Herman), Peebles predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation. Along with making major contributions to Big Bang nucleosynthesis, dark matter, and dark energy, he was the leading pioneer in the theory of cosmic structure formation in the 1970s. Long before it was considered a serious, quantitative branch of physics, Peebles was studying physical cosmology and has done much to establish its respectability. Peebles said, &quot;It was not a single step, some critical discovery that suddenly made cosmology relevant but the field gradually emerged through a number of experimental observations. Clearly one of the most important during my career was the detection of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation that immediately attracted attention [...] both experimentalists interested in measuring the properties of this radiation and theorists, who joined in analyzing the implications&quot;. His Shaw Prize citation states &quot;He laid the foundations for almost all modern investigations in cosmology, both theoretical and observational, transforming a highly speculative field into a precision science.&quot;

Peebles has a long record of innovating the basic ideas, which would be extensively studied later by other scientists. For instance, in 1987, he proposed the primordial isocurvature baryon model for the development of the early universe. Similarly, Peebles contributed to establishing the dark matter problem in the early 1970s. Peebles is also known for the Ostriker–Peebles criterion, relating to the stability of galactic formation.

Peebles&#x27; body of work was recognized with him being named a 2019 Nobel Laureate in Physics, &quot;for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology&quot;; Peebles shared half the prize with Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz who had been the first to discover an exoplanet around a main sequence star.

Peebles was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988.

<text>Alfonso Wong Kar-Hei (; 27 May 1923 – 1 January 2017), also known by his pen name Wong Chak, was a Hong Kong manhua artist who created one of the longest-running comic strips, &quot;Old Master Q&quot;, that became popular across Asia.

==Biography==
Wong was born in Tianjin, Republic of China. He studied Western art at Fu Jen Catholic University, then based in Beijing and finished school by 1944. In 1956, he moved south to British Hong Kong. He was responsible for drawings in Bibles for a French Catholic missionary in the colony and also became the art editor for Hong Kong Catholic magazine, &quot;Lok Fung Pao&quot; ().

Wong became well known in 1961 when he made the manhua &quot;Old Master Q&quot;. The comic was one of the most influential pieces of work in Hong Kong under British rule before it was transferred back to China, and was popular across Asia. It voiced the opinions of the citizens in an exaggerated comical sense at a time when comics avoided controversial political issues. From integration with mainlanders to the education gap, there were few limitations being broached by the sensitive subjects which accompanied his stories. The comic became known for maintaining popularity for over 40 years against endless competition with other Hong Kong manhua and Japanese manga. Later adaptations into movies, Chinese animation and other works of fiction continued well after his retirement. He later emigrated to the United States and retired by the mid-1990s, leaving his son Joseph Wong in charge of the Old Master Q series since then.

In an exhibition showcasing Wong, the Hong Kong Arts Centre called his work, &quot;a collective memory of Chinese-speaking communities around the world.&quot; Original pieces of Wong&#x27;s work have been exhibited by both Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s auction houses.

==Personal life and Death==
Wong was ambidextrous (i.e. capable of drawing with both hands) and particularly enjoyed drawing fish. He used his eldest son&#x27;s name &quot;Wong Chak&quot; () as a pen-name and relinquished the comic to him in 1995. Wong died of organ failure on 1 January 2017, at the age of 93.

He was also the son of the ethnic-Manchu Chinese warlord Wang Chengbin.

<doc id="864789" wikidata="Q626690" url="?curid=864789" title="Aravalli Range">
<text>The Aravalli Range (also spelled &quot;Aravali&quot;) is a mountain range in Northern-Western India, running approximately in a south-west direction, starting near Delhi, passing through southern Haryana, Rajasthan, and ending in Ahmedabad Gujarat. The highest peak is Guru Shikhar on Mount Abu at . The Aravalli Range is one of the oldest geological features on Earth, having its origin in the Proterozoic era.

The Aravalli Range is rich in natural resources and serves as check to the growth of the western desert.

== Etymology ==
Aravalli, a composite Sanskrit word from the roots &quot;ara&quot; and &quot;vali&quot;, literally means the &quot;line of peaks&quot;.

== Natural history ==
=== Geology ===

The Aravalli Range, an eroded stub of ancient mountains, is believed to be the oldest range of fold mountains in India. The natural history of the Aravalli Range dates back to times when the Indian Plate was separated from the Eurasian Plate by an ocean. The Proterozoic Aravalli-Delhi orogenic belt in northwest India is similar to the younger Himalayan-type orogenic belts of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic era (of the Phanerozoic) in terms of component parts and appears to have passed through a near-orderly Wilson supercontinental cycle of events. The range rose in a Precambrian event called the Aravalli-Delhi Orogen. The Aravalli Range is a northeast–southwest trending orogenic belt located in the northwestern part of Indian Peninsula. It is part of the Indian Shield that formed from a series of cratonic collisions. In ancient times, Aravalli were extremely high but since have worn down almost completely from millions of years of weathering, whereas the Himalayas, young fold mountains, are still continuously rising. Aravalli have stopped growing higher due to the cessation of upward thrust caused by the tectonic plates in the Earth&#x27;s crust below them. The Aravalli Range joins two of the ancient Earth&#x27;s crust segments that make up the greater Indian craton, the Aravalli Craton which is the Marwar segment of Earth&#x27;s crust to the northwest of the Aravalli Range, and the Bundelkand Craton segment of the Earth&#x27;s crust to the southeast of the Aravalli Range. Cratons, generally found in the interiors of tectonic plates, are old and stable parts of the continental lithosphere that have remained relatively undeformed during the cycles of merging and rifting of continents.

It consists of two main sequences formed in the Proterozoic eon, metasedimentary rock (sedimentary rocks metamorphosed under pressure and heat without melting) and metavolcanic rock (metamorphosed volcanic rocks) sequences of the Aravalli Supergroup and Delhi Supergroup. These two supergroups rest over the Archean Bhilwara Gneissic Complex basement, which is a gneissic (high-grade metamorphism of sedimentary or igneous rocks) basement formed during the archean eon 4 Ga ago. It started as an inverted basin, that rifted and pulled apart into granitoid basement, initially during Aravalli passive rifting around 2.5 to 2.0 Ga years ago and then during Delhi active rifting around 1.9 to 1.6 Ga years ago. It started with rifting of a rigid Archaean continent banded gneissic complex around 2.2 Ga with the coexisting formation of the Bhilwara aulacogen in its eastern part and eventual rupturing and separation of the continent along a line parallel to the Rakhabdev (Rishabhdev) lineament to the west, simultaneous development of a passive continental margin with the undersea shelf rise sediments of the Aravalli-Jharol belts depositing on the attenuated crust on the eastern flank of the separated continent, subsequent destruction of the continental margin by accretion of the Delhi island arc (a type of archipelago composed of an arc-shaped chain of volcanoes closely situated parallel to a convergent boundary between two converging tectonic plates) from the west around 1.5 Ga. This tectonic plates collision event involved early thrusting with partial obduction (overthrusting of oceanic lithosphere onto continental lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary) of the oceanic crust along the Rakhabdev lineament, flattening and eventual wrenching (also called strike-slip plate fault, sideways horizontal movement of colliding plates with no vertical motion) parallel to the collision zone. Associated mafic igneous rocks show both continental and oceanic tholeiitic geochemistry (magnesium and iron-rich igneous rocks) from phanerozoic eon (541–0 million) with rift-related magmatic rock formations.

The Aravalli-Delhi Orogen is an orogen event that led to a large structural deformation of the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle, such as Aravalli and Himalayas fold mountains) due to the interaction between tectonic plates when a continental plate is crumpled and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges, and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis.

=== Minerals ===
The archean basement had served as a rigid indentor which controlled the overall wedge shaped geometry of the orogen. Lithology of area shows that the base rocks of Aravalli are of Mewar Gneiss formed by high-grade regional metamorphic processes from preexisting formations that were originally sedimentary rock with earliest life form that were formed during the archean eon, these contain fossils of unicellular organism such as green algae and cyanobacteria in stromatolitic carbonate ocean reefs formed during the paleoproterozoic era. Sedimentary exhalative deposits of base metal sulfide ores formed extensively along several, long, linear zones in the Bhilwara aulacogen or produced local concentration in the rifted Aravalli continental margin, where rich stromatolitic phosphorites also formed. Tectonic evolution of the Aravalli Mountains shows Mewar Gneiss rocks are overlain by Delhi Supergroup type of rocks that also have post-Aravalli intrusions. Metal sulfide ores were formed in two different epochs, lead and zinc sulfide ores were formed in the sedimentary rocks around 1.8 Ga years ago during Paleoproterozoic phase. The tectonic setting of zinc-lead-copper sulfides mineralisation in the Delhi supergroup rocks in Haryana-Delhi were formed by mantle plume volcanic action around one billion years ago covering Haryana and Rajasthan during the mesoproterozoic. In the southern part of the Aravalli supergroup arc base metal sulfides were generated near the subduction zone on the western fringe and in zones of back-arc extension to the south-east. Continued subduction produced tungsten-tin mineralisation in S-type (sedimentary unmetamorphosed rock), felsic (volcanic rock), and plutons (crystallised solidified magma). This includes commercially viable quantities of minerals, such as rock phosphate, lead-zinc-silver mineral deposits at Zawar, Rikahbdev serpentinite, talc, pyrophyllite, asbestos, apatite, kyanite and beryl.

=== Mining ===
Mining of copper and other metals in the Aravalli range dates back to at least the 5th century BCE, based on carbon dating. Recent research indicates that copper was already mined here during the Sothi-Siswal period going back to . Ancient Kalibangan and Kunal, Haryana settlements obtained copper here.

=== Geographical features ===


The Indian Craton includes five major cratons. Cratons are part of continental crust made up of upper layer called platforms and older bottom layer called basement rocks. shields are part of a craton where basement rock crops out at the surface and it is the relatively oldest and most stable part that are undeformed by the plate tectonics. The Aravalli Craton (Marwar-Mewar Craton or Western Indian Craton) covers Rajasthan as well as western and southern Haryana. It includes the Mewar Craton in the east and Marwar Craton in the west. It is limited by the Great Boundary Fault in the east, the Thar Desert in the west, Indo-gangetic alluvium in the north, and the Son River-Narmada River-Tapti River basins in the south. It mainly has quartzite, marble, pelite, greywacke and extinct volcanos exposed in the Aravalli-Delhi Orogen. Malani Igneous Suite is the largest in India and third largest igneous suit in the world. The uniqueness of the geological feature of Malani Igneous Suite at Jodhpur prompted the Geological Survey of India to declare the site as a National Geological Monument.

==== Tectonic-stratigraphic evolution ====
Tectonic-stratigraphic evolution of the Aravalli Range:
* Neoproterozoic: &quot;Marwar Group&quot;
* 500–550 Ma: &quot;Malani Igneous Suite&quot;
* 720–750 Ma: &quot;Sindhrath/Punagarh Group&quot;
* 800–850 Ma: &quot;Sirohi Group&quot;
* 900 Ma: Erinpura granite

* Mesoarchean (3300–3000 Ma): &quot;Mewar gneiss&quot; with &quot;Jagat Supergroup&quot;

==== Stratigraphic classification ====
The stratigraphic classification of the Aravalli Range can be divided into the following parts (north to south direction):

* The Archean basement is a banded gneissic complex with schists (medium grade metamorphic rock), gneisses (high grade regional metamorphic rock), composite gneiss and quartzites. It forms the basement rock for both the Delhi Supergroup and the Aravalli Supergroup.
* Aravalli Supergroup: The Aravalli supergroup passes through Rajasthan state, dividing it into two halves, with three-fifths of Rajasthan on the western side towards the Thar Desert and two-thirds on the eastern side consisting of the catchment area of Banas and Chambal rivers bordering the state of Madhya Pradesh. Guru Shikhar, the highest peak in the Aravalli Range at in Mount Abu of Rajasthan, lies near the south-western extremity of the Central Aravalli range, close to the border with Gujarat state. The southern &quot;Aravalli Supergroup&quot; enters the northeast of Gujarat near Modasa where it lends its name to the Aravalli district, and ends at the centre of the state at Palanpur near Ahmedabad.
** Champaner Group is a rectangular outcrop composed of subgreywacke, siliceous phyllite, pelitic schist, quartzite and pertomict conglomerate.
** Lunavada Group is a polygon area in the south of the Aravali Orogen composed of greywacke-phyllite
** Jharol Group is spread over 200 km2 area with average width of 40 km carbonate-free phyllite and arenite with turbidite facies and argillaceous rocks.
** Udaipur Group is a thick accumulation of greywacke-phyllite basement overlain by dolomite.
** Debari Group consists of Carbonates, Quartzite, and Pelitic rocks which are overlain by the Delwara group.
** Delwara Group is spread over a 500 km2 area with average thickness of 500 m and includes basement orthoquartzite overlain by volcanic conglomerate.
** Unconformities
*** Mangalwar/Sandmata Complex and Mewar Gneiss with enclaves of the Jagat group
* Delhi Supergroup
** Alwar Group with arenaceous and mafic volcanic rocks
*** Delhi Ridge, in the north
*** Haryana Aravalli ranges, in the west
**** Tosham Hill range basement rocks include quartzite with chiastolite, the upper layers of quartz porphyry ring dyke, felsite, welded tuff and muscovite biotite granite rocks which have commercially nonviable tin, tungsten and copper. The Tosham Hill range, west of Bhiwani in Haryana, is the northernmost end of the Aravalli range. A northeastern extension of the Aravalli extends to the national capital of India also. Locally known as a ridge it diagonally traverses to the South Delhi (hills of Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary), where at the hills of Bandhwari, it meets the HaryanaAravalli range consisting of various isolated hills and rocky ridges passing along the southern border of Haryana.
**** Madhogarh hill
**** Satnali hill
**** Nuh-Ferozepur Jhirka hill range, runs along Haryana-Rajasthan border from Nuh to the south of Ferozepur Jhirka.
*** Rajasthan Alwar range, in the east
** Ajabgarh Group – Kumbhalgarh Group with carbonate, mafic volcanic and argillaceous rocks
** Raialo Group with mafic volcanic and calcareous rocks

==Human history==

The Aravalli Range has been site of three broad stages of human history, early Stone Age saw the use of flint stones; mid-Stone Age starting from 20,000 BP saw the domestication of cattle for agriculture; and post Stone Age starting from 10,000 BP saw the development of the Kalibangan civilisation, 4,000 BP the Aahar civilisation and 2,800 BP the Gneshwar civilisation.
===Tosham Hills - Indus Civilisation mines===
The Tosham hills have several Indus Valley Civilisation sites in and around the hill range as the area falls under copper-bearing zone of Southwest Haryana and Northeast Rajasthan of Aravalli hill range.

Investigation of IVC network of mineral ore needs for metallurgical work and trade, shows that the most common type of grinding stone at Harappa is of Delhi quartzite type found only in the westernmost outliers of the Aravalli range in southern Haryana near Kaliana and Makanwas villages of Bhiwani district. The quartzite is red-pink to pinkish grey in colour and is crisscrossed with thin haematite and quartz filled fractures with sugary size grain texture.

Ravindra Nath Singh and his team of Banaras Hindu University carried out ASI-financed excavations of Indus Valley Civilisation site on the grounds of the Government School in Khanak, during 2014 and 2016. They found early to mature Harappan phase IVC materials, pottery, semiprecious beads of lapis lazuli, carnelian and others. They also found evidence of metallurgical activities, such as crucibles (used for pouring molten metal), furnace lining, burnt floor, ash and ore slugs. Ceramic petrography, metallography, scanning electron microscope (SEM, non-destructive, surface images of nanoscale resolution), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXA and EDXMA non-destructive, qualitative and quantitative elemental composition) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, destructive method) scientific studies of the material found prove that the Khanak site was inhabited by the IVC metal-workers who used the locally mined polymetallic tin, and they were also familiar with metallurgical work with copper and bronze. The lowest level of site dates back as far the pre-Harappan era to Sothi-Siswal culture (6600 BP) tentatively.

=== Ganeshwar Sunari Cultural Complex ===
The Ganeshwar Sunari Cultural Complex (GSCC) is a collection of third millennium BCE settlements in the area of the Aravalli Hill Range. Among them, there are similarities in material culture, and in the production of copper tools. They are located near the copper mines.
&quot;The GSCC is east of the Harappan culture, to the north-east of Ahar–Banas Complex, north/north west to the Kayatha Culture and at a later date, west of the OCP-Copper Hoard sites (Ochre Coloured Pottery culture–Copper Hoard culture). Located within the regions of the Aravalli Hill Range, primarily along the Kantli, Sabi, Sota, Dohan and Bondi rivers, the GJCC is the largest copper producing community in third millennium BCE South Asia, with 385 sites documented. Archaeological indicators of the GSCC were documented primarily in Jaipur, Jhunjhunu, and Sikar districts of Rajasthan, India ...&quot;
Pottery found in the area include incised ware, and reserved slipware.

There are two main type sites, Ganeshwar, and Sunari, in Tehsil Kot Putli, Jaipur district (Geo coordinates: N 27° 35&#x27; 51&quot;, 76° 06&#x27; 85&quot; E).

== Environment ==

=== Climate ===
The Northern Aravalli range in Delhi and Haryana has humid subtropical climate and hot semi-arid continental climate with very hot summers and relatively cool winters. The main characteristics of climate in Hisar are dryness, extremes of temperature, and scanty rainfall. The maximum daytime temperature during the summer varies between . During winter, its ranges between 1.5 and 4 °C.

The Central Aravalli range in Rajasthan has an arid and dry climate.
The Southern Aravalli range in Gujarat has a tropical wet and dry climate

=== Rivers ===
Three major rivers and their tributaries flow from the Aravalli, namely Banas and Sahibi rivers which are tributaries of Yamuna, as well as Luni River which flows into the Rann of Kutch.

* North-to-south flowing rivers originate from the western slopes of the Aravalli range in Rajasthan, pass through the southeastern portion of the Thar Desert, and end into Gujarat.
** Luni River, originates in the Pushkar valley near Ajmer, ends in the marshy lands of Rann of Kutch. It used to be one of the channel of the Saraswati River, as a result its banks have several Indus Valley Civilisation sites including Lothal.
** Sakhi River, ends in the marshy lands of Rann of Kutch.
** Sabarmati River, originates on the western slopes of Aravalli range of the Udaipur district, end into the Gulf of Khambhat of the Arabian Sea.
* West to north-west flowing rivers originate from the western slopes of the Aravalli range in Rajasthan, flow through semi-arid historical Shekhawati region and drain into southern Haryana. Several Ochre Coloured Pottery culture sites, also identified as late Harappan phase of Indus Valley Civilisation culture, have been found along the banks of these rivers.
** Sahibi River, originates near Manoharpur in Sikar district flows through Haryana and meets its confluence with the Yamuna in Delhi where it is called Najafgarh drain, along with its following tributaries: Masani barrage, is an important wildlife area.
*** Dohan river, tributary of the Sahibi River, originates near Neem Ka Thana in Sikar district).
*** Sota River, tributary of the Sahibi River with which it merges at Behror in Alwar district.
*** Krishnavati river, former tributary of Sahibi river, originates near Dariba copper mines in Rajsamand district of Rajasthan, flows through Patan in Dausa district and Mothooka in Alwar district, then disappears in Mahendragarh district in Haryana much before reaching Sahibi River. It previously was a tributary to the Sahibi and part of its present canalised channel is called the &quot;Outfall Drain No. 8&quot;. Many important wetlands lie in its paleochannel, including Matanhail, Chhuchhakwas-Godhari, Khaparwas Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Sarbashirpur, Sultanpur National Park, Basai and The Lost Lake (Gurugram).
* West to north-east flowing rivers, originating from the eastern slopes of Aravalli range in Rajasthan, flow northwards to Yamuna.
** Chambal River, a southern-side tributary of Yamuna River.
*** Banas River, a northern-side tributary of Chambal River.
**** Berach River, a southern-side tributary of Banas River, originates in the hills of Udaipur district.
***** Ahar River, a right-side (or eastern side) tributary of the Berach river, originates in the hills of Udaipur district, flows through Udaipur city forming the famous Lake Pichola.
***** Wagli River, a right-side tributary of the Berach River.
***** Wagon River, a right-side tributary of the Berach River.
***** Gambhiri River, a right-side tributary of the Berach River.
***** Orai River, a right-side tributary of the Berach River.

===Wildlife corridors===
====The Great Green Wall of India====

&quot;The Great Green Wall of Aravalli&quot; is a proposed 1,600 km long and 5 km wide green ecological corridor along Aravalli range from Gujarat to Delhi, it will be connected to Shivalik hill range and 1.35 billion (135 crore) new native trees will be planted over 10 years to rehabilitate the forest cover in this area. To be implemented on a concept similar to the Great Green Wall of Sahara in Africa, it will act as a buffer against pollution, 51% of which is caused by the industrial pollution, 27% by vehicles, 8% by crop burning and 5% by diwali fireworks. It was proposed several times form the 1990s, but as of 2024 the project is still in the planning stage.

==== Northern Aravalli leopard and wildlife corridor ====


The Sariska–Delhi leopard wildlife corridor or the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor is a 200 km long important biodiversity and wildlife corridor which runs from the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan to Delhi Ridge.

This corridor is an important habitat for the Indian leopards and jackals of Aravalli. In January 2019, the Wildlife Institute of India announced that they will undertake the survey of leopard and wildlife, using pugmarks and trap cameras, subsequently, leopards and jackals will be tracked via the radio collars. Urban development, especially the highways and railways bisecting the Aravalli range and wildlife corridor in several places pose a great risk. Large parts of Aravalli are legally and physically unprotected, with no wildlife passages and little or no wildlife conservation work resulting in deaths of over 10 leopards in 4 years between January 2015 to January 2019.

The Haryana side of the Gurugram-Faridabad Aravalli hill forests lack availability of water due to which wild animals are seldom seen there. The Government of Haryana used drones for aerial surveys and dug 22 ephemeral pits in 2018 to store the rainwater which became dry during the summer months. In January 2019, the government announced the plan to make the pit perennial by connecting those with pipelines from the nearby villages.

Human activity, such as unplanned urbanization and polluting industrial plants, also pose a great threat. There is often reluctance and denial on part of the government officials of the presence of wildlife such as leopard so that the forest land can be exploited and opened up for the intrusive human development.

This habitat is under serious threat from the wrong actions of the Government of Haryana which in 2019 passed the amendment to the Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900 (PLPA). Governor has given his assent for the act, but it has not yet been notified by the Haryana government, hence it is in limbo and has not officially become a law. This amendment will reduce the Haryana&#x27;s Natural Conservation Zones (NCZs) by 47% or 60,000 acres from 122,113.30 hectares to only 64,384.66 hectares. This is in violation of multiple guidelines of the Supreme Court of India as well as &quot;NCR Planning Board&quot; (NCRPB) notification which states the original 122,113.30 hectares ecologically sensitive forest of South Haryana is a forest, &quot;The major natural features, identified as environmentally sensitive areas, are the extension of Aravalli ridge in Rajasthan, Haryana and NCT-Delhi; forest areas; rivers and tributaries... major lakes and water bodies such as Badkhal lake, Suraj Kund and Damdama in Haryana sub-region&quot;. This area as part of Northern Aravalli leopard and wildlife corridor is an important habitat for the leopards in Haryana.

==== Southern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor ====
This corridor runs from Sariska and Ranthmbor to Rann of Kutch National Park and Gir National Park in Gujarat.

===Flora===
The Aravalli Range has several forests with a diversity of environment.

===Fauna===

The Aravalli Range is rich in wildlife. The first-ever 2017 wildlife survey of a 200 square kilometre area crossing five districts (Gurgaon, Faridabad, Mewat, Rewari and Mahendergarh) of Haryana by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found 14 species, including leopards, striped hyena (7 sightings), golden jackal (9 sightings, with 92% occupancy across the survey area), nilgai (55 sightings), palm civet (7 sightings), wild pig (14 sightings), rhesus macaque (55 sightings), peafowl (57 sightings) and Indian crested porcupine (12 sightings). Encouraged by the first survey, the wildlife department has prepared a plan for a comprehensive study and census of wildlife across the whole Aravalli Range, including radio collar tracking of the wild animals. Well known leopard and hyena habitat is along the Ferozpure Jhirka-Nuh Aravali range as well as Delhi South Ridge (Faridabad-Gurugram) to Farrukhnagar area on the Delhi–Haryana border, with reports of sightings in Saidpur, Lokri and Jhund Sarai Viran villages near the KMP expressway; Bhukarka 7 km from Pataudi; Pathkori, Bhond, Mandawar in Ferozepur Jirka region.

===Concerns===
In May 1992, some parts of the Aravalli hills in Rajasthan and Haryana were protected from mining through the Ecologically Sensitive Areas clauses of Indian laws. In 2003, the central government of India prohibited mining operations in these areas. In 2004, India&#x27;s Supreme Court banned mining in the notified areas of Aravalli Range. In May 2009, the Supreme Court extended the ban on mining in an area of 448 km2 across the Faridabad, Gurgaon and Mewat districts in Haryana, covering the Aravalli Range.

A 2013 report used high-resolution Cartosat-1 and LISS-IV satellite imaging to determine the existence and condition of mines in the Aravalli Range. In the Guru Gram district, the Aravalli hills occupy an area of 11,256 hectares, of which 491 (4.36%) hectares had mines, of which 16 hectares (0.14%) were abandoned flooded mines. In the Faridabad and Mewat districts, about 3610 hectares were part of mining industry, out of a total of 49,300 hectares. These mines were primarily granite and marble quarries for India&#x27;s residential and real estate construction applications. In the Central Rajasthan region, Sharma states that the presence of some mining has had both positive and negative effects on neighboring agriculture and the ecosystem. The rain-induced erosion brings nutrients as well as potential contaminants.

== Economy ==
The Aravali Range is the source area of many rivers, resulting in development of human settlements with sustainable economy since pre-historic times. The Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project, Western Dedicated Freight Corridor, Mumbai–Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor, North Western Railway network, Jaipur–Kishangarh Expressway and Delhi–Jaipur Expressway, all run parallel to the length of the Aravalli Range providing an economic boost.

== Tourism ==
The Aravalli Range is the home of forests, wildlife, protected areas, UNESCO heritage listed forts, rivers, and historical monuments which sustain a large tourism industry.

== Concerns ==
Damage to the environment and ecology from the unorganized urbanization, overexploitation of the natural resources including water and minerals, mining, untreated human waste and disposal, pollution, loss of forest cover and wildlife habitat, unprotected status of most of the Aravalli and the lack of an integrated Aravalli management agency are the major causes of concern.

<text>Samuel Lee Gravely Jr. (June 4, 1922 – October 22, 2004) was a United States Navy officer. He was the first African American in the U.S. Navy to serve aboard a fighting ship as an officer, the first to command a Navy ship, the first fleet commander, and the first to become a flag officer, retiring as a vice admiral.

== Early life and training ==
Gravely was born on June 4, 1922, in Richmond, Virginia, the oldest of five children of Mary George Gravely and postal worker Samuel L. Gravely Sr. He attended Virginia Union University but left before graduating to join the Naval Reserve in 1942. He had attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army in 1940 but was turned away due to a supposed heart murmur.

After receiving basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois, Gravely entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. Upon graduating from UCLA, he completed Midshipmen&#x27;s School at Columbia University and was commissioned an ensign on December 14, 1944. His commission came only eight months after the &quot;Golden Thirteen&quot; became the first African-American officers in the U.S. Navy.

== World War II and Korean War ==
Gravely began his seagoing career as the only black officer aboard the submarine chaser , which was one of two U.S. Navy ships (the other being ) with a predominantly black enlisted crew. Before June 1, 1942, African Americans could only enlist in the Navy as messmen; &quot;PC-1264&quot; and &quot;Mason&quot; were intended to test the ability of African Americans to perform general Navy service. For the remainder of World War II, &quot;PC-1264&quot; conducted patrols and escort missions along the east coast of the U.S. and south to the Caribbean.

In 1946, Gravely was released from active duty, remaining in the Naval Reserve. He married schoolteacher Alma Bernice Clark later that year; the couple went on to raise three children, Robert, David, and Tracey. He returned to his hometown of Richmond and re-enrolled at Virginia Union University, graduating in 1948 with a degree in history and then working as a railway postal clerk.

Gravely was recalled to active duty in 1949 and worked as a recruiter in Washington, D.C., before holding both shore and sea assignments during the Korean War. During that time he served on the USS &quot;Iowa&quot; as a communications officer. He transferred from the Reserve to the regular Navy in 1955 and began to specialize in naval communications.

== Vietnam War and later career ==
Many of Gravely&#x27;s later career achievements represented &quot;firsts&quot; for African Americans. From 15 February 1961 to 21 October 1961, he served as the first African-American officer to command a U.S. Navy ship, the (Robert Smalls had briefly commanded a Navy ship in the American Civil War, although he was a civilian, not a Navy officer). He also commanded the radar picket destroyer escort from January 1962 to June 1963. During the Vietnam War he commanded the destroyer as it performed plane guard duty and gunfire support off the coast of Vietnam in 1966, making him the first African American to lead a ship into combat. In 1967 he became the first African American to reach the rank of captain, and in 1971 the first to reach rear admiral.
At the time of his promotion to rear admiral, he was in command of the guided missile frigate . Gravely commanded Cruiser-Destroyer Group 2. He was later named the Director of Naval Communications. From 1976 to 1978, he commanded the Third Fleet based in Hawaii, then transferred to Virginia to direct the Defense Communications Agency until his retirement in 1980.

Gravely&#x27;s military decorations include the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal and Navy Commendation Medal. He was also awarded the World War II Victory Medal, the Korean Service Medal with two service stars, the United Nations Korea Medal, and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.

== Later years and legacy ==
Following his military retirement, Gravely settled in rural Haymarket, Virginia, and worked as a consultant. An elementary school in Haymarket, Virginia has been named the Samuel L. Gravely Jr. Elementary School in his honor.

After suffering a stroke, Gravely died at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 22, 2004. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

In Richmond, the street on which Gravely grew up was renamed &quot;Admiral Gravely Boulevard&quot; in 1977. Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. Elementary School in Haymarket, Virginia was named after him in 2008. The destroyer , commissioned in 2010, was named in his honor.

Vice Admiral Gravely is honored annually in San Pedro, California, aboard Battleship Iowa, at the Gravely Celebration Experience. Each year the organization honors trailblazers exemplifying VADM Gravely&#x27;s leadership and service with the Leadership &amp; Service Award. An essay competition for U.S. History high school students that explores VADM Gravely&#x27;s motto — “Education, Motivation, Perseverance” — is affiliated with the annual event.

<text>Łabiszyn is a small town in Żnin County, in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland, with 4,452 inhabitants (2010). It is located on the Noteć river near Żnin, on the border between the historic regions of Pałuki and Kuyavia.

== History ==

The first written mention of Łabiszyn comes from the 13th century as an estate owned by a knight, located within medieval Piast-ruled Poland. A document from 1247 mentions Dezydery of Łabiszyn, probably the owner of the settlement. In 1362 the village is mentioned as &quot;Labissino&quot; and &quot;Lambissiono.&quot; In the 14th century, Łabiszyn belonged to the Prawdzic family. Thanks to their efforts, the settlement and the castle were granted town rights in 1369. In 1407, the town already had its own wax seal with the coat of arms depicting the right, open and severed hand with the inscription &quot;Łabiszyn&quot;. King Władysław Jagiełło passed through Łabiszyn on November 2, 1410 , on his way from Inowrocław to Szubin after the victorious Battle of Koronowo. According to tradition, Jagiełło planted two oaks on the Łabiszyński Hill, one of which has survived to this day.

Łabiszyn was a private town, administratively located in the Kcynia County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In the years 1604-1610, the owner of the town with the castle and the surrounding villages was Andrzej Czarnkowski, the voivode of Kalisz. From the 16th to the 19th century, the town was owned by the Czarnkowski, Opaliński, Gembicki and Skórzewski families. In 1678, the castellan Paweł Gembicki confirmed the town rights for Łabiszyn. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was devastated by fires and plagues. With the annexation of the town by Prussia in the late 18th-century Partitions of Poland, Protestant clothiers from German states began to arrive. On September 30, 1794, during the Kościuszko Uprising, the troops of General Henryk Dąbrowski defeated the Prussian army near Łabiszyn and captured the town, which was defended by the Prussian garrison of Lieutenant Beyer. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and then re-annexed by Prussia after the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815. Another battle between Polish insurgents and the Prussian army near Łabiszyn took place in 1848, during the Greater Poland uprising, as part of the Revolutions of 1848.
Under Prussian rule, the town was part of Kreis Schubin in the Province of Posen until 1919. It was also part of the German Empire from 1871. According to the German census of 1890, the town had a population of 2,328, of which 900 (38.7%) were Poles. In the aftermath of World War I, the town&#x27;s inhabitants played an important role in the Greater Poland uprising (1918-1919). In 1919, the Łabiszyn insurgents won a decisive victory against the Germans and the town became part of the newly established Second Polish Republic. Within interwar Poland, the town was initially located in the Poznań Voivodeship and then in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany. Łabiszyn was one of the sites of executions of Poles carried out by Germany in 1939 as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. In 1940, the Germans renamed the town &quot;Lüderitz,&quot; in memory of Adolf Lüderitz, founder of the German South West Africa colony. Towards the end of World War II in 1945, the town was captured by the Red Army and restored to Poland.

<doc id="864805" wikidata="Q7455811" url="?curid=864805" title="Service stripe">
<text>A service stripe is an embroidered diagonal stripe worn on the sleeve(s) of some military and paramilitary uniforms. In the case of the United States military, service stripes are authorized for wear by enlisted personnel on the lower part of the sleeve of a uniform to denote length of service. Service stripes vary in size and in color.

==Criteria==
The United States Army authorizes one stripe for each three-year period of service, while the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, and United States Coast Guard authorize one stripe for each four-year period of duty.

In contrast to the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medals, a service stripe is authorized for wear by enlisted personnel upon completion of the specified term of service, regardless of the service member&#x27;s disciplinary history. For example, a sailor or marine with several non-judicial punishments and courts-martial would still be authorized a service stripe for each four-year period of service, although the Good Conduct Medal would be denied.

==History==
In 1777, the French &quot;ancien régime&quot;-era army had used &quot;Galons d&#x27;ancienneté&quot;, or &quot;Seniority Braid&quot; (cloth braid chevrons nicknamed &quot;brisures&quot; &gt; &quot;breaks&quot;) worn on the upper sleeves awarded for each seven years of enlistment. Soldiers who wore such emblems were called &quot;briscards&quot; (&quot;breakers&quot;). The practice was continued in Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s army in which they were awarded for 10, 15, and 20 years of service. The French Army later moved them to the lower sleeves and the rank stripes to the upper sleeves. Service chevrons were worn on the lower left sleeve and Wound Stripes were worn on the lower right sleeve (influencing the U.S. Wound Chevron device).

In the United States, the concept of a service stripe dates back to 1782 when, during the American Revolution, George Washington ordered that enlisted men who had served for three years &quot;with bravery, fidelity and good conduct&quot; should wear &quot;a narrow piece of white cloth, of angular form&quot; on the left sleeve of the uniform coat. In the U.S. Army, sleeve stripes denoted a successful completion of a standard enlistment. They were the same color as the enlisted rank stripes and were &quot;half-chevrons&quot; (angled strips of cloth). Service during the American Civil War was denoted by a red stripe bordered by the rank stripe color (called a &quot;Blood Stripe&quot;). The artillery corps, who wore red stripes on their uniforms, wore a white stripe bordered red instead.

==Wear and use==
===United States===
Sleeve stripes are worn only by enlisted personnel. U.S. Army soldiers, U.S. Navy sailors and U.S. Coast Guardsmen wear their stripes on the bottom cuff of the left sleeve, where U.S. Marines wear them at the bottom cuff of both sleeves. Since 1953 U.S. soldiers wear them on the left sleeve and Overseas Service Bars on the right one. Prior to 1953, Overseas Service Bars were worn on the left sleeve. Service stripes are only worn on formal uniforms, and are not seen on work uniforms.

Navy service stripes come in three colors and they are red, gold, and blue. They are 7 inches long and three-eighths of an inch wide for male chief petty officers; male sailors from rates seaman recruit to petty officer first class wear service stripes 5.25 inches long and three-eighths of an inch wide. Female navy sailors wear service stripes 5.25 inches long and a quarter-inch wide. They are worn two inches above the left sleeve cuff on jackets, and 1.5 inches above the cuff on service dress blue jumpers and the new summer white jumpers. On the old-style summer white jumpers they are worn two inches above the cuff. Multiple navy service stripes are worn a quarter-inch apart from each other.

====United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard====

For the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, service stripes are given to service members for every four years of service.

=====Color=====
The U.S. Navy authorizes gold service stripes for those sailors with over twelve cumulative years&#x27; of service. Until June 2019, the service had to have been free of disciplinary action in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Navy Reserve. During the period when that rule was in effect, in cases where a disciplinary infraction had occurred, the sailor was not denied a service stripe but simply was authorized the standard red stripe design only.

Like the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard authorizes gold and red service stripes, however the color in the case of the latter does not depend on time in service, but rather on rank: Junior enlisted personnel (i.e. those in paygrades E-1 to E-6) wear red service stripes, whereas chief petty officers (i.e. those in paygrades E-7 to E-9) wear gold service stripes.

====United States Military Academy====
These stripes are also used on the sleeves of the full dress uniform worn by cadets of the United States Military Academy at West Point, which denote the number of years a cadet has been at the academy. This is also done by cadets of other military colleges and prep schools.

====United States Air Force====
The United States Air Force is the only branch of service that does not authorize service stripes. The Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon is awarded instead. Historically, persons who were in the Army Air Forces and then became part of the Air Force when it was separated from the Army in 1947 could continue to wear their service stripes.

====U.S. law enforcement use====
In many civilian law enforcement agencies in the United States, policemen, troopers, constables, and sheriff&#x27;s deputies will often be awarded service stripes for wear on their long-sleeved uniforms, usually on the lower left sleeve. One stripe may be worn for varying lengths of time and differs by agency; for instance the Los Angeles Police Department issues one service stripe for every five years served.

<text>Ivan Stepanovich Konev (; 28 December 1897 – 21 May 1973) was a Soviet general and Marshal of the Soviet Union who led Red Army forces on the Eastern Front during World War II, responsible for taking much of Axis-occupied Eastern Europe.

Born to a peasant family, Konev was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1916 and fought in World War I. In 1919, he joined the Bolsheviks and served in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. After graduating from Frunze Military Academy in 1926, Konev gradually rose through the ranks of the Soviet military. By 1939, he had become a candidate to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Konev took part in a series of major campaigns, including the battles of Moscow and Rzhev. Konev further commanded forces in major Soviet offensives at Kursk, in the Dnieper–Carpathian and Vistula–Oder offensives. In February 1944, he was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. On the eve of German defeat, Konev&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front was pitted against the armies of Georgy Zhukov in the Race to Berlin. Konev was the first Allied commander to enter Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, after the Prague uprising.

He replaced Zhukov as commander of Soviet ground forces in 1946. In 1956, he was appointed commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces, and led the violent suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and Prague Spring. In 1961, as commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, he ordered the closing of West Berlin to East Berlin during the building of the Berlin Wall. Konev remained a popular military figure in the Soviet Union until his death in 1973.

==Early life==
Konev was born 28 December 1897 in the village of Lodeyno in the Nikolsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate to a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Konev graduated from a parish school in the village of Yakovlevskaya Gora in 1906, and later the Nikolo-Pushemsky Zemstvo School in the neighboring village of Schetkino in 1912. At the age of 15, he found work as a forester and lumberjack at Podosinovets and Arkhangelsk.

==Military career==

In the beginning of 1915, he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. Posted to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion (then part of the Southwestern Front) as a junior sergeant in 1917, he fought in the Kerensky Offensive in Galicia in July 1917.

When the October Revolution broke out in November 1917, he was demobilized and returned home; in 1918, he joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Red Army, serving as an artilleryman. During the Russian Civil War of 1917-1923, he served with the Red Army in the Russian Far Eastern Republic. His commander at one time was Kliment Voroshilov, a close colleague of Joseph Stalin, who later became People&#x27;s Commissar for Defense (in office: 1925-1940). (This connection was the key to Konev&#x27;s subsequent career and to his protection during the Great Purge of the late 1930s.) In his memoirs, he wrote: &quot;Together with a group of demobilized soldiers, I organized the overthrow of the land administration, the confiscation of agricultural land and the imprisonment of traders.&quot; He participated in the violent suppression of the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion.

In 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the Frunze Military Academy, and between then and 1941 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head first of the Transbaikal then of the North Caucasus Military Districts in 1940 and 1941, respectively. In 1934 he became commander and political commissar of the 37th Rifle Division. In July 1938, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Red Banner Army. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party Central Committee.

===World War II===
When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the 19th Army in the Vitebsk region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army&#x27;s retreat, first to Smolensk and then to the approaches to Moscow.

He commanded the Kalinin Front from October 1941 to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around Moscow and the Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941–42. For his role in the successful defense of the Soviet capital, Stalin promoted Konev to Colonel-General. In the summer of 1942 Konev led the Kalinin Front and later the Western Front in the battle on the Rzhev salient.

Konev held &quot;Front&quot; (army group) commands for the rest of the war. He commanded the Soviet Western Front until February 1943, the North-Western Front February–July 1943, and the 2nd Ukrainian Front from July 1943 (later further the 1st Ukrainian Front) until May 1945.
He participated in the Battle of Kursk, commanding the southern part of the Soviet counter-offensive, the Steppe Front, where he actively and energetically promoted &quot;maskirovka&quot; (the use of military camouflage and deception). Among the &quot;maskirovka&quot; measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defense lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air-defense network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army&#x27;s camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz&#x27;s view, Konev&#x27;s forces &quot;generated a major portion of the element of surprise&quot;.

As a result, the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defenses. The commander of the 19th Panzer division of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, General G. Schmidt, wrote that &quot;We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter&quot;.

After the Soviet victory (August 1943) at Kursk, Konev&#x27;s armies retook Belgorod, Odessa, Kharkiv and Kyiv. The subsequent Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by Nikolai Vatutin and by Konev, trapped German forces of Army Group South in a pocket or &quot;cauldron&quot; west of the Dnieper river. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent Korsun battle eliminated the cauldron. According to Milovan Djilas, Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands of German prisoners of war: &quot;The cavalry finally finished them off. &#x27;We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender&#x27; the Marshal recounted with a smile.&quot;

For Konev&#x27;s achievements in Ukraine, the Presidium promoted him to Marshal of the Soviet Union in February 1944. Konev was one of Stalin&#x27;s favorite generals and one of the few senior commanders whom even Stalin admired for his ruthlessness.

During 1944 Konev&#x27;s armies advanced from Ukraine and Belarus into Poland and later into Czechoslovakia. In May 1944 he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the Balkans, (the first Jassy–Kishinev Offensive) together with Generals Rodion Malinovsky and Fyodor Tolbukhin.

By July, he had advanced to the Vistula River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the Fourth Ukrainian Front, advanced into Slovakia and fought alongside the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.

In January 1945, Konev, together with Georgy Zhukov, commanded the Soviet armies which launched the massive winter offensive in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the Oder River. In southern Poland his armies seized Kraków (18 January 1945). Soviet historians, and generally Russian sources, claimed that Konev preserved Kraków from Nazi-planned destruction by ordering a lightning attack on the city. Konev&#x27;s January 1945 offensive also prevented planned destruction of the Silesian industry by the retreating Germans.

In April Konev&#x27;s troops, together with the 1st Belorussian Front under his competitor, Marshal Zhukov, forced the line of the Oder and advanced towards Berlin. Konev&#x27;s forces entered the city first, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honor of capturing Berlin and hoisting the Soviet flag over the Reichstag. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the United States Army at Torgau (25 April 1945) and also retook Prague (9 May 1945) shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.

===Post-war career===

After the war the Soviet Union appointed Konev as head of the Soviet occupation forces in Eastern Germany and also Allied High Commissioner for Austria. In 1946 he became Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Ground Forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the Carpathian Military District. He held this post until 1960, when he retired from active service. In 1961–62, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany, where he ordered the closing of West Berlin to East Berlin during the construction of the Berlin Wall. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.

Following the Prague Spring, Konev headed a delegation that visited Czechoslovakia in May 1968 to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet victory during World War II. After Stalin&#x27;s death, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new party leader Nikita Khrushchev, being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief Lavrenty Beria in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution. It has been claimed that Konev visited military units in Czechoslovakia in order to obtain first-hand information to better assess the situation in the country, but there is no documentary evidence to support this.

The British military historian John Erickson wrote that he was surprised with the extent of personal archives (&quot;lichnye arkhivy&quot;) held by former Red Army soldiers of many ranks, and that &quot;there is no substitute for having the late Marshal Koniev (sic) – spectacles perched on nose – read from his own personal notebook, detailing operational orders, his own personal instructions to select commanders and his tally of Soviet casualties. And while on the subject of casualties, Marshal Koniev made it plain that, though such figures did exist, he was not prepared on his own authority to allow certain figures to be released for publication while a number of commanders were still alive.&quot;

Konev remained one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most admired military figures until his death in 1973. He married twice, and his daughter Nataliya is Dean of the Department of Linguistics and Literature at the Military University of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.

In 1969, the Ministry of Defence of the USSR published Konev&#x27;s 285-page war memoir called &quot;Forty-Five&quot;. It was later translated into English in the same year and published by Progress Publishers, Moscow. This work discusses Konev&#x27;s taking of Berlin, Prague, his work with Zhukov, Stalin, his field meeting with General Omar Bradley and Jascha Heifetz. In English, the book was titled &quot;I. Konev – Year of Victory&quot;. It was also published in Spanish and French under the titles &quot;El Año 45&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;an 45&quot; respectively.

Konev died on 21 May 1973 at age 75 in Moscow. Following his cremation, his ashes were placed in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis with those of the greatest figures of the USSR, and can still be visited today.

==Monuments==
Konev has monuments, primarily in Russia. The places include Svidník, Patriot Park (Moscow region), Kirov, Belgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, and Vologda.

On 9 January 1991, his memorial sculpture in Kraków was dismantled less than just 4 years after it had been unveiled. The sculpture was given to the Russian city of Kirov. The memorial plaque in front of the apartment building where he lived (three blocks from the Kremlin) is still mounted on the brick wall.

The Konev monument erected by the communist government of Czechoslovakia in Prague 6 (náměstí Interbrigády) in 1980 became a subject of controversy that escalated in 2018, after which the city administration added explanatory text to the monument, noting the participation of its subject in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and the Prague Spring. The monument was removed on 3 April 2020, with the Czech president Miloš Zeman criticizing the removal as &quot;an abuse of the state of emergency&quot;. Within days, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation announced it would begin a symbolic investigation of the alleged &quot;defiling of symbols of Russia&#x27;s military glory&quot;.

<doc id="864826" wikidata="Q1411665" url="?curid=864826" title="Virtual Telecommunications Access Method">
<text>Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM) is the IBM subsystem that implements Systems Network Architecture (SNA) for mainframe environments. VTAM provides an application programming interface (API) for communication applications, and controls communication equipment such as adapters and controllers. In modern terminology, VTAM provides a communication stack and device drivers.

==History==
VTAM was introduced in 1974 after a series of delays as a major component of SNA along with the 370x Network Control Program (NCP) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC).

In IBM terminology, VTAM is an access method software allowing application programs to read and write data to and from external devices. It is called &#x27;virtual&#x27; because it was introduced at the time when IBM was introducing virtual storage by upgrading the operating systems of the System/360 series to virtual storage versions. VTAM was supposed to be the successor to the older telecommunications access methods, such as Basic Telecommunications Access Method (BTAM) and Telecommunications Access Method (TCAM), which were maintained for compatibility reasons. As such, VTAM is comparable with the Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM), which was at that time a new and supposedly converged access method for disk storage.

===ACF/VTAM===
Originally, VTAM was provided free of charge like most systems software of that time. However, VTAM 2 was the last version to be freely available. ACF/VTAM (Advanced Communication Function/Virtual Telecommunications Access Method) was introduced in 1976 and was provided for a licence fee. The major new feature of ACF/VTAM was the &quot;Multisystem Networking Facility&quot;, which introduced &quot;implementation of intersystem communication among multiple S/370s.&quot;.

A limited version of ACF/VTAM known as ACF/VTAME (Advanced Communications Function for the Virtual Telecommunications Access Method Entry) was made available for DOS/VSE systems running on the IBM 4300.

===SNA Services===
VTAM has been renamed to be the SNA Services feature of &quot;Communications Server for OS/390&quot;. This software package also provides TCP/IP functions. VTAM is used in multiple enterprises as of September 2019.

==Features==

VTAM supports several network protocols, including SDLC, Token Ring, start-stop, Bisync, local (channel attached) 3270 devices, and later TCP/IP.

In a VTAM network, communication took place through an integrated communication adapter in the mainframe itself, or by a separate programmable front-end processor, the IBM 3745/3746 Communications Processor, with its own operating system, the Network Control Program NCP. These machines are no longer actively marketed by IBM, but are still supported. IBM provides hardware maintenance and microcode updates for the estimated 20,000 installed 3745/3746 controllers. A robust third party industry of smaller 3745/3746 specialty companies provide such controllers, upgrades, features, and related support services. VTAM and SNA are still in use by many enterprises.

Initially, VTAM only allowed communication between mainframes and peripheral equipment such as terminals, distributed processors and minicomputers. Later, &#x27;cross-domain&#x27; resources were introduced (not to be confused with TCP/IP domains) allowing SNA networks with more than one mainframe. A subsequent development was SNA Network Interconnect (SNI), allowing networks of different organizational entities (firms) to be interconnected with a high degree of independence. Finally, Advanced Peer to Peer Networking functions (APPN) were added to VTAM. In APPN the mainframe is no longer the heart of the network, but all nodes in the network are considered as peers. One of the reasons why APPN was introduced was to act as a DECnet-killer, but by the time APPN was actually shipped the popularity of DECnet had already declined. APPN was considered overly complex and as of 2012 has been largely superseded by TCP/IP.

<text>Wilson Lowry FRS (24 January 1762 – 23 June 1824) was an English engraver.

==Life==
He was born at Whitehaven, Cumberland, the son of Strickland Lowry, a portrait painter. The family settled in Worcester, and Wilson Lowry, as a boy, left home to work as a house painter in London and Arundel, Sussex. On returning home is received some instruction in engraving from a local craftsman.

He went to London at the age of 18 with an introduction to the print seller John Boydell, who gave him work and introduced him to William Blizard, the surgeon. Blizard encouraged Lowry to become a surgeon and for four years he undertook training, but abandoned it.

Lowry studied under John Browne, the landscape engraver and also received training at the Royal Academy Schools. Lowry developed a number of special instruments to assist his work: about 1790 he devised a ruling machine; in 1801 a device for generating elliptical curves; in 1806 another for making perspective drawings. Lowry was the first engraver to use diamond points and to discover the composition of a corrosive fluid for biting the lines into steel plates.

Lowry specialised in making engraving of architectural and mechanical topics, and excelled in perspective views of machinery. His work appears in Tilloch&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of the Society of Arts&quot;, Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;Magna Graecia&quot; (1807), and &quot;Vitruvius&quot; (1812), Peter Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Architecture&quot; (1795–98), and &quot;Architectural Dictionary&quot; (1819), George Crabb&#x27;s &quot;Technological Dictionary&quot; (1823), and the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;. Lowry&#x27;s most famous work in this field was undoubtedly the work he did for &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; between 1802 and 1819, including contributing articles, but did work for other encyclopaedias including &quot;Pantologia&quot; and the &quot;British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot;.

Lowry was a founder member of the Geological Society and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1812. He died at his residence, Great Titchfield Street, London.

==Family==
He married firstly a Miss Porter: they had two daughters, one of whom, Matilda, (who became Mrs Hemming) was a portrait painter. He married secondly mineralogist Rebecca (1761–1848), daughter of Abraham Delvalle, of a Sephardic Jewish family of &quot;small but prosperous&quot; snuff and tobacco merchants settled in England and which had gained British citizenship, and sister of Abigail Delvalle, mother of the economist David Ricardo. They had a son Joseph Wilson Lowry and a daughter Delvalle Lowry, who married John Varley the landscape painter.

<text>Babywearing is the practice of wearing or carrying a baby in a sling or in another form of carrier. Babywearing has been practiced for millennia around the world. Babywearing is a form of baby transport which can be used for as long as mutually desired, often until toddlerhood and beyond. In the industrialized world, babywearing has gained popularity in recent decades. Part of the reason for this shift is due to the influence of advocates of attachment parenting. 

== History ==
An early example of skin-to-skin infant care is the traditional Inuit woman&#x27;s garment, the &quot;amauti&quot;, had a large pouch at the back where the baby would sit against the mother&#x27;s bare back.

The Dayak people of Borneo traditionally employed a wooden baby carrier called a bening.

==Benefits==

Pediatrician Dr. William Sears coined the phrase &quot;attachment parenting&quot; to describe an approach emphasizing the facilitation of strong bonds between a child and their parents. Sears attributes many benefits to babywearing and holding children generally.

The benefits of babywearing include:

* In the wearing of newborns in particular, the mothers&#x27; oxytocin levels are increased through the physical contact with the infant, leading to a more intimate maternal bond, easier breastfeeding and better care, thus lowering the incidence of postpartum depression and psychosomatic illness in the mother; similarly, the father carrying the baby has benefits for the paternal bond.
* Infants who are carried are generally calmer, as more of their primal/survival needs are met. The caregiver can be seen, heard, smelled, touched, tasted, provide feeding and the motion necessary for continuing neural development, gastrointestinal and respiratory health and to establish balance (inner ear development) and muscle tone is constant.
* Parental rhythms (walking, heartbeat, etc.) can have balancing and soothing effects on infants.
* Appropriate babywearing, particularly inward-facing babywearing can be beneficial to neck muscle development, and contribute positively to healthy hip development. 
* Infants are &quot;humanized&quot; earlier by developing socially. Babies are closer to people and can study facial expressions, learn languages faster and be familiar with body language.
* Independence is established earlier.
* Attachment between child and caregiver is more secure.
* Decreases risk of positional plagiocephaly (&quot;flat head syndrome&quot;) caused by extended time spent in a car seat and by sleeping on the back.
* It reduces DDH (developmental dysplasia of hip) which results due to longer durations spent in car seats or strollers. It allows wide base of support which supports ball and socket of hip which are not properly developed in babies or younger kids. Studies show it is less common in India due to their traditional way of carrying infants in their initial age.

Kangaroo care, in which the baby&#x27;s bare body rests against the parent&#x27;s bare chest, with or without a baby sling, has shown clear benefits to premature and ill infants.

Studies of parent-child attachment, parental satisfaction and infant crying point to babywearing as a satisfactory arrangement for both parents and baby. Baby carriers and slings help increase the number of hours a day an infant is held, and proponents believe that the more a baby is held, the less the baby cries. However, this experience is not universal; for example, the indigenous Munduruku people of Brazil use baby slings to carry their babies all day. The babies are allowed to nurse freely, and are passed from one woman or girl to another to be carried throughout the day. Yet, the Munduruku babies cry very frequently despite being carried all day.

== Practicality ==

Babywearing allows the wearer to have two free hands to accomplish two handed tasks while caring for the baby&#x27;s need to be held or be breastfed. Babywearing offers a safer alternative to placing a car seat on top of a shopping cart. It also allows children to be involved in social interactions and to see their surroundings as an adult would.

It follows that many sling and soft carrier users have found that carrying their infant is much easier on the back and shoulders than lugging them in a car seat. The weight of the child is spread more evenly across the upper body and they don&#x27;t have to struggle with a bulky, hard and awkward car seat.

There are many different types of carriers. They can be purchased or made by the parent or caregiver. Wraps, baby slings, mei tais, backpack carriers and soft structured carriers with buckles (also referred to as SSCs) make up the vast majority of carriers. In the western world, carriers can also be seen as a fashion statement and be worn as part of an outfit. They come in many different designs and colors and are available in many different types of fabrics from specialist manufacturers, including bamboo, silk, hemp, cotton, wool, fleece, flax/linen and more recently some synthetic blends such as Repreve and Tencel.

==Infant feeding and babywearing==
Breastfeeding and babywearing often go hand in hand. Many baby slings and other carriers offer mothers privacy and for many mothers, the option of nursing hands-free while tending to other activities or household chores. Not all mothers can nurse hands-free in a baby carrier. Large-breasted mothers and mothers of small or hypotonic infants may need to support the breast or help maintain proper positioning of the baby&#x27;s head or body. Even so, a properly adjusted baby carrier can help reduce an arm strain and allow a parent more freedom of movement while nursing, even if it does not allow her to be completely hands-free.
Babywearing can help premature babies and babies who are slow weight gainers to gain weight at a faster rate. Since the baby is held up close to the parent, the baby will be able to be nursed more often and often for longer intervals.

Breastfeeding with a sling or carrier is not simple for all parents. Before attempting to breastfeed in a carrier, it is critical to first master the technique of nursing without a carrier. Latch and position are critical, and they must be established before adding a carrier to the mix. In cases where nursing is problematic, babywearing can help to simplify other aspects of parenting by giving a parent free hands to deal with breastpumps, bottles, and other supplementation devices.

Some parents prefer, even with the best carriers, to take time out and sit down to nurse a baby. Some babies may reflexively clamp down when nursing while a parent moves around, so nursing while babywearing is not always entirely comfortable. Individual experience will vary radically not only from parent to parent, but also from baby to baby, even within the same family. Some babies nurse very well in slings and carriers, others do not.

Where breastfeeding is not possible, babywearing can aid attachment by encouraging closeness during bottle feeding. Daycare providers and foster parents often find that babywearing allows them to better meet the needs of multiple children by freeing hands during times when babies need to be held. It is possible to wear two children at once; this is known as tandem babywearing. This can be done with twins or with two children of different ages.

== Safety==
As with any physical activity, there are certain safety precautions which must be considered in babywearing. The guidelines are particularly important to remember when carrying a newborn baby that has limited head control. The acronym TICKS was created to assist with remembering the safety basics of babywearing:

* Tight
* In view
* Close enough to kiss
* Keep chin off the chest
* Supported back

In the case of a caregiver accidentally tripping or falling while wearing a baby, the wearer&#x27;s arms would likely be free to break the fall, while the child remained relatively safe close to the carer&#x27;s center of gravity. If the child was being carried in arms without a carrier, the likelihood of injury would be much higher due to the impossibility of the carer being able to both hold the child safely and protect themselves from injury.

Exercise with babies in slings and carriers is now a growing way of parents being able to undertake exercise and movement-based classes with their babies. It has been reported to increase mother-child bonding through physiological and neurological pathways. It is important to find a safe and qualified provider who can ensure the safety of the parent and the baby in the particular exercise class. Babywearing yoga is particularly popular as it does not involve bouncing and moving fast whilst carrying baby in slings.

<doc id="864834" wikidata="Q1500532" url="?curid=864834" title="Battle of Cravant">
<text>The Battle of Cravant was fought on 31 July 1423, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War between English and French forces at the village of Cravant in Burgundy, at a bridge and ford on the banks of the river Yonne, a left-bank tributary of the Seine, southeast of Auxerre. The battle ended in a victory for the English and their Burgundian allies.

==Background==
After the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, the English king was permitted to occupy all the country north of the Loire. In 1422, with Henry V suddenly dead and an infant King Henry VI of England assuming the throne, hostilities resumed.

In the early summer of 1423, the French Dauphin Charles assembled an army at Bourges intending to invade Burgundian territory. This French army contained a large number of Scots under John Stewart, Earl of Buchan, who was commanding the entire mixed force, as well as Spanish and Lombard mercenaries. This army besieged the town of Cravant. The garrison of Cravant requested help from the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy, who raised troops and in turn sought support from Burgundy&#x27;s English allies, which was forthcoming. The two allied armies, one English, one Burgundian, ed at Auxerre on 29 July.

==Allied preparations==
The allied commanders held a council of war in Auxerre Cathedral on the evening of 29 July. This led to the drafting of an order of battle, covering a mixture of tactical and disciplinary matters. The army was clearly intending to fight a dismounted action, with horses taken to the rear, and archers were to prepare anti-cavalry stakes. That night the army was ordered to pray for victory. The march was to begin at 10 o&#x27;clock the following morning.

==Armies==
===Allies===
The combined English and Burgundian forces were led by Jean de Toulongeon, Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury, with Lord Willoughby as second in command. The Anglo-Burgundian army mustered about 4,000 men (2,000 Burgundians and 2,000 English), including 1,500 men-at-arms (500 English and 1,000 Burgundian), 1,500 English archers, some Burgundian crossbowmen and pioneers and 40 &quot;veuglaires&quot; (light artillery), manned by the citizens of Auxerre.

===French===
The French army was commanded by Sir John Stewart of Darnley with Louis, Count of Vendôme, as second in command. There were about 4,000 Scots. A sizeable French force was present with smaller forces of Aragonese and Lombard mercenaries. The Dauphinist army was larger than the Anglo-Burgundian force perhaps by two to three times.

==Battle==

The allied army marched throughout 30 July and that evening, short of Cravant, sighted the enemy. The following day, having assessed the enemy position as too strong, they crossed the river Yonne and attempted to reach Cravant by another route. Approaching the town from across the river, the allies saw that the French army had changed position and was now waiting for them on the other bank. For three hours the forces watched each other, neither willing to attempt an opposed river crossing. Eventually, the Scots archers began shooting into the allied ranks. The allied artillery replied, supported by their own archers and crossbowmen.

Seeing the Dauphinists were suffering casualties and becoming disordered, Salisbury took the initiative and his army began to cross the waist-high river, some 50 metres wide, under a covering barrage of arrows from the English archers. Meanwhile, another force under Willoughby attacked the Scots across the narrow bridge and divided the Dauphin&#x27;s army. The French began to withdraw, but the Scots refused to flee and fought on, to be cut down by the hundreds. Perhaps 1,200–3,000 of them fell at the bridgehead or along the riverbanks, and over 2,000 prisoners were taken, including Darnley (who also lost an eye) and the Comte de Vendôme. While the Anglo-Burgundians were fighting, the Burgundian knights in Cravant came out from the fortress following the lord of Chastellux and launched a devastating cavalry charge against the Dauphinist forces which completely broke their lines. Being crushed from two sides the Dauphinist army fled the battlefield.

The Dauphin&#x27;s forces retreated to the Loire. On 2 August, the English and Burgundian armies withdrew separately from Cravant, the Burgundians marching to Dijon, the English to Montaiguillon.

==Aftermath==
The success at Cravant was the first for a joint English and Burgundian army. Despite this success, the allies would rarely fight together again, usually operating separately from one another. The Dauphinists would suffer an even greater defeat the following year at the Battle of Verneuil.

<text>Reynaldo Daluz Pagtakhan, (born 7 January 1935) is a Canadian physician, professor and politician. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin, and served as a Member of Parliament from 1988 until his defeat in the 2004 election. 

==Education==
Born at the Mary Johnston Hospital in Manila and raised in Bacoor, Cavite in the Philippines, Pagtakhan received his Doctor of Medicine from the University of the Philippines. He is a brother of the Mu Sigma Phi, the first, the largest, and the most acclaimed medical fraternity in Asia. He completed his pediatric residency and cardiology fellowship at the Washington University Medical Center/St. Louis Children&#x27;s Hospital and his Master of Science from the University of Manitoba and respirology fellowship at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Winnipeg. The degree of Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) was conferred on Pagtakhan by the University of the Philippines. In 2010, the degree of Doctor of Science (honoris causa) conferred by the University of Perpetual Help Rizal Jonelta Foundation-School of Medicine 

==Medical career and community involvement==

Prior to his political career, Pagtakhan was a Full Professor of Pediatrics and Child Health at the University of Manitoba Faculty of Medicine. He joined the medical faculty at the University of Manitoba in 1971 as a lecturer and became a professor in 1985. He also worked as a pediatric respirologist at the Winnipeg Children&#x27;s Hospital between 1971 and 1988.

In addition to the above responsibilities, Pagtakhan also served as Director of the Manitoba Cystic Fibrosis Centre, President of the Manitoba Pediatric Society, member of the Winnipeg Police Commission, the first chair of the Board of Presidents of the Canadian Ethnocultural Council, and National President of the United Council of Filipino Canadian Associations in Canada.

In 1986, he was elected as a Winnipeg school trustee in the St. Vital district and served in that capacity until 1988.

==Political career==
Pagtakhan was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 federal election in the riding of Winnipeg North, defeating incumbent New Democrat David Orlikow who had held the riding since 1962. He became the first Filipino-born Canadian to be elected to the House of Commons. He was easily re-elected in the 1993 election, defeating New Democratic challenger Judy Wasylycia-Leis. In the elections of 1997 and 2000, he was elected for the redistributed riding of Winnipeg North-St. Paul.

Pagtakhan served as parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien from 23 February 1996, to 15 July 1998. He was appointed to cabinet on 9 January 2001, and served as Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific) until 15 January 2002. His appointment to cabinet marked the first time in over 75 years that an M.P. from north Winnipeg became a member of the federal cabinet. As Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Pagtakhan took on a number of tasks including representing Canada as Head of its delegation to the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.

On 15 January 2002, he was promoted to Minister of Veterans Affairs and Minister responsible for Manitoba. In this capacity, he served on the Cabinet Committees on Economic Union, Social Union and Government Communications.

During his tenure as Minister responsible for Manitoba (also known as the Senior Minister for Manitoba), Pagtakhan was part of the government that funded major projects in Manitoba such as the expansion of the Red River Floodway and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Pagtakhan also served as Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development) from 26 May 2002, to 12 December 2003.

On 12 December 2003, new prime minister Paul Martin appointed him as Minister of Western Economic Diversification. In this capacity he served on the Cabinet Committees on Domestic Affairs and Aboriginal Affairs. During his tenure in this position, Pagtakhan, amongst other things, announced funding for the Winnipeg-based International Centre for Infectious Diseases.

Further redistribution pushed Pagtakhan back into the riding of Winnipeg North for the election of 2004. He lost to Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who had been elected for Winnipeg North Centre in 1997 and 2000.

==Life after politics==

Since returning to private life in 2004, Pagtakhan has been actively involved in numerous ventures. In 2005 and 2006, he served as the Founding Director of the Global College at the University of Winnipeg and Chair of the college&#x27;s advisory board. He is currently co-chair of its Global Advisors. In addition, Pagtakhan serves as a Public Adjudicator of the Prairie Regional Panel of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, Governor of the Canadian International Peace Project and Chair of the Manitoba Liberal Party&#x27;s Election Readiness Committee. In 2017, he was made a Member of the Order of Manitoba.

<text>Harry Walter Legge (1 June 1906 – 22 March 1979) was an English classical music record producer, most especially associated with EMI. His recordings include many sets later regarded as classics and reissued by EMI as &quot;Great Recordings of the Century&quot;. He worked in the recording industry from 1927, combining this with the post of junior music critic of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. He was assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and in World War II played a role in bringing music to the armed forces and civilians.

After the war, Legge founded the Philharmonia Orchestra and worked for EMI as a recording producer. In the 1960s, he quarrelled with EMI and resigned. He attempted to disband the Philharmonia in 1964, but it continued as an independent body without him. After this he had no permanent job, and confined himself to giving masterclasses with, and supervising the recordings of, his second wife, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.

==Life==
===Early years===
Legge was born in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London, where his father was a tailor. He was educated at the Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. He excelled in Latin and French, but received no musical training. He left school at 16 and had no further formal education. Encouraged by his father he developed a taste for music, and Richard Wagner in particular, in pursuit of which he taught himself to read music and to speak German.
Legge first joined HMV in 1927, writing album and analytical notes and copy for the company&#x27;s monthly retailing magazine, &quot;The Voice&quot;, but he caught the eye of the leading record producer, Fred Gaisberg, and was soon taking an active role in HMV recording procedures. Between 1933 and 1938, Legge also worked as a music critic for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;.

In the pre-war years, Legge pioneered &quot;subscription&quot; recordings, by which the public were invited to pay in advance for their copies of future recordings, thus making it economically possible for EMI to make such &quot;niche&quot; but classic recordings as the songs of Hugo Wolf and the complete piano works of Beethoven (played by Artur Schnabel). Another pre-war recording supervised by Legge, which has been reissued on LP and CD, was Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s set of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, made in Berlin in 1937. Beecham invited Legge to join him at the Opera as assistant artistic director. Given a free hand by Beecham he engaged Richard Tauber, Jussi Björling, Maria Reining, Hilde Konetzni, Julius Patzak and Helge Roswänge in their Covent Garden debuts.

During World War II, Legge&#x27;s poor eyesight prevented him from serving in the armed forces. At Beecham&#x27;s instigation he took on the musical side of ENSA, arranging concerts for British troops all over the world, and securing the services of musicians such as Solomon, Sir Adrian Boult and John Barbirolli. In 1941 Legge married the singer Nancy Evans; they divorced in 1948.

===EMI and the Philharmonia===
After the war Legge set to work to refresh EMI&#x27;s catalogue and its roster of star performers. He set up his base in Vienna, then still occupied by the Allies, and contracted German and Austrian artists who were then seriously short of work. These performers included Josef Krips, Irmgard Seefried, Ljuba Welitsch, Hans Hotter, Ludwig Weber, Herbert von Karajan and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (whom Legge married in 1953). Later he was among the first to spot the potential of Maria Callas, whose studio recordings he produced for EMI. The repertoire he chose to record was broad, though not extending much earlier than Handel and among modern composers concentrating on the approachable and diatonic. From the 1940s to the 1960s he supervised a long series of recordings of the works of William Walton.

Legge had promoted some Lieder recitals before the war, but in 1945, finding his influence at Covent Garden much diminished under the management of David Webster he again ventured into promoting concerts. For these, and for recordings, he founded a new orchestra, the Philharmonia. Beecham conducted its first concert (for the fee of one cigar) but was unwilling to be the employee of his former assistant and soon founded the Royal Philharmonic in competition with the Philharmonia. In its early years the Philharmonia became closely identified with Karajan, but when he turned his attentions to the Berlin Philharmonic, Legge worked more and more with Otto Klemperer, a prominent conductor in the 1920s and &#x27;30s whose career Legge revitalised. Other eminent musicians of the time whom Legge persuaded to conduct the Philharmonia were Wilhelm Furtwängler, Arturo Toscanini and Richard Strauss. At its peak in the 1950s the Philharmonia was widely rated as the finest British orchestra and one of the finest orchestras in the World. In 1964, concerned at what he saw as falling standards, Legge disbanded the orchestra, which at once re-formed as the New Philharmonia, without him but with Klemperer as chief conductor.

===Last years===
Legge&#x27;s employer, EMI, tolerated his independent ways for many years, but in the 1960s attempts were made to curtail his freedom of choice of repertoire, and finally in 1964 he resigned. His memoirs, edited by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and published in 1982, set out his disenchantment with EMI and its increasingly powerful internal committees: 
:I am convinced that in the arts, committees are useless. What is necessary are people like Karajan, Culshaw and me; we know not only how to achieve the best artistic results but how to attract the public and carry out the whole operation with carefully chosen collaborators. Democracy is fatal for the arts; it leads only to chaos or the achievement of new and lower common denominators of quality.
In retirement Legge, together with Schwarzkopf, gave many joint masterclasses for young singers but he failed to find a permanent job. He was offered, and accepted, the directorship of the Wexford Festival, but he suffered a disabling heart attack in 1967 before he could take up the post, and he withdrew. He continued to supervise the EMI recordings made by his wife, but the breach with the company was complete when in 1977 and 1979 he produced her last recordings not for EMI but for Decca, EMI&#x27;s great rival.

Legge attended Schwarzkopf&#x27;s final appearance, a recital at Zürich Opera House on 19 March 1979, despite having suffered a heart attack two days earlier. Three days after the recital, he died in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France, at the age of 72. He was cremated, and his ashes were initially placed near those of Hugo Wolf in Vienna, as he had requested. After Elisabeth Schwarzkopf&#x27;s death in 2006, their ashes were buried next to her parents in Zumikon near Zürich, where she had lived from 1982 to 2003.

==Musical legacy==
Legge&#x27;s artistic judgment was sometimes questioned. He was aesthetically conservative; he wrote to a friend, &quot;If producers and scenic designers are allowed to continue their writing of graffiti and vulgarity and stupidity on masterpieces … not to mention Chéreau at Bayreuth – we shall be forced to insist that they write the libretto and music to match the rubbish they put on the stage!&quot; Legge predicted to John Culshaw and Georg Solti that their Decca recording of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; would not sell; it became a classical best-seller. He was responsible for three recordings of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, conducted by Beecham, Karajan and Klemperer, each of which has incurred the disapproval of critics for omitting the spoken dialogue. His recording of &quot;Fidelio&quot; under Klemperer has been compared unfavourably with Klemperer&#x27;s contemporaneous live recording from Covent Garden, on the grounds that Legge&#x27;s chosen singers were less effective than their ROH rivals. He was suspicious of stereo recording, and resisted it for as long as he could.

Nevertheless Legge&#x27;s legacy is &quot;a vast number of outstanding recordings that set standards unlikely ever to be surpassed&quot;. His recordings of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; (Sargent), &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (Furtwängler), &quot;Tosca&quot; (De Sabata), &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and &quot;Falstaff&quot; (Karajan), &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Böhm) and the core German symphonic repertory (Klemperer, Furtwängler, Karajan…) have remained in the catalogue for decades, first on LP and then on CD.

<doc id="864847" wikidata="Q373058" url="?curid=864847" title="Azure (color)">
<text>Azure ( , ) is the color between cyan and blue on the spectrum of visible light. It is often described as the color of the sky on a clear day.

On the RGB color wheel, &quot;azure&quot; (hexadecimal #0080FF) is defined as the color at 210 degrees, i.e., the hue halfway between blue and cyan. In the RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a television or computer screen, azure is created by adding a 50% of green light to a 100% of blue light.

In the X11 color system, which became a model for early web colors, azure is depicted as a pale cyan or white cyan.

==Etymology and history==
The color azure ultimately takes its name from the vivid-blue gemstone lapis lazuli, a metamorphic rock. &#x27; is the Latin word for &quot;stone&quot; and &#x27; is the genitive form of the Medieval Latin &quot;&quot;, which is taken from the Arabic &quot;lāzaward&quot; (), itself from the Persian &quot;lāžaward&quot;, which is the name of the stone in Persian and also of a place where lapis lazuli was mined.

The name of the stone came to be associated with its color. The French &#x27;, the Italian &#x27;, the Polish &#x27;, Romanian &#x27; and &#x27;, the Portuguese and Spanish &#x27;, Hungarian &quot;&quot;, and the Catalan &quot;atzur&quot;, all come from the name and color of lapis lazuli. The dropping of the initial &quot;l&quot; in Romance languages may be a case of the linguistic phenomenon known as rebracketing, i.e. Romance speakers may have perceived the sound as the initial phoneme of the definitive article in their respective language.

The word was adopted into English from the French, and the first recorded use of it as a color name in English was in 1374 in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s work &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, where he refers to &quot;a broche, gold and &quot;asure&quot;&quot; (a brooch, gold and azure).

Some languages, such as Italian, generally consider azure to be a basic colour, separate and distinct from blue. Some sources even go to the point of defining blue as a darker shade of azure.

Azure also describes the color of the mineral azurite, both in its natural form and as a pigment in various paint formulations. In order to preserve its deep color, azurite was ground coarsely. Fine-ground azurite produces a lighter, washed-out color. Traditionally, the pigment was considered unstable in oil paints, and was sometimes isolated from other colors and not mixed.

The use of the term spread through the practice of heraldry, where &quot;azure&quot; represents a blue color in the system of tinctures. In engravings, it is represented as a region of parallel horizontal lines, or by the abbreviation &quot;az.&quot; or &quot;b.&quot; In practice, azure has been represented by any number of shades of blue. In later heraldic practice a lighter blue, called bleu celeste (&quot;sky blue&quot;), is sometimes specified.

==Distinction among indigo, azure, and cyan==

According to the logic of the RGB color wheel, indigo colors are those colors with hue codes between 255 and 225 (degrees), azure colors are those colors with hue codes between 195 and 225, and cyan colors are those colors with hue codes between 165 and 195. Another way of describing it could be that cyan is a mixture of blue and green light, azure is a mixture of blue and cyan light, and indigo is a mixture of blue and violet light.

All of the colors shown below in the section &quot;shades of azure&quot; are referenced as having a hue between 195 and 225 degrees, with the exception of the very pale X11 web color azure – RGB (240, 255, 255) – which, with a hue of 180 degrees, is a tone of cyan, but follows the artistic meaning of azure as sky blue.

* In Chinese mythology, the Azure Dragon is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations. It is sometimes called the &quot;Azure Dragon of the East&quot; (). Known as &quot;Seiryū&quot; () in Japan and &quot;Cheongryong&quot; (／) in Korea, it represents the east and the spring season.
* Savoy azure (&quot;azzurro Savoia&quot;) is a traditional national color for Italy, taken from the traditional colors of the House of Savoy, the ruling house of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia that established the first modern united Italian state. The association between azure and Italian nationalism led in the Italy national football team donning azure jerseys, giving them the nickname &quot;gli Azzurri&quot; (&quot;the Azures&quot;). It is also the color of the Italian state police (&quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;).
* Ken Nordine&#x27;s 1966 album &quot;Colors&quot; features the song &quot;Azures&quot;.
* Portuguese and Spanish tilework known as azulejo has the same etymology due to the color blue (&quot;azul&quot;) being used in its design.

* In Hebrew the azure color is called Tekhelet (&quot;תכלת&quot;). Tekhelet and white are sacred colors for the Jewish people. In the Torah there is a mitzva to put a Tekhelet thread in the tzitzit. The colors Tekhelet and white are the National colors of Israel and appear in the flag of Israel (where the Tekhelet resembles blue).

==Astronomy==

<doc id="864854" wikidata="Q4910788" url="?curid=864854" title="Bill Schonely">
<text>William W. Schonely (June 1, 1929 – January 21, 2023), nicknamed &quot;The Schonz&quot;, was an American sports broadcaster who was the play-by-play announcer for the Portland Trail Blazers for almost three decades, from the team&#x27;s launch in 1970 until 1998. A native of Pennsylvania, he worked in radio in Louisiana and Seattle before settling in Portland, Oregon. In addition to his work for the Blazers, he was a sportscaster for Major League Baseball games, several minor league baseball teams, college sports, National Hockey League games, and junior ice hockey.

==Background and military career==

Schonely was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, the second and first surviving child of Walter and Juanita Schonely (née Hoch). A stutterer as a child, Schonely worked on a weekly high school informational radio show on WNAR in Norristown, which led to opportunities at radio and television stations in Philadelphia. Upon graduation, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was sent to Guam. While stationed overseas, Schonely transferred to Armed Forces Radio, where he was a disc jockey as well as doing news, sports and interviews. He also did his first play-by-play, calling military football and baseball games. In 1951, Schonely was reassigned to Quantico, Virginia, where he worked on the weekly base newspaper and emceed military events and parades under the guidance of General Clifton B. Cates. Among his duties were escorting military celebrities to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia for radio and TV interviews.

==Early career==

===Baton Rouge===

Upon leaving the Marines, Schonely followed a job offer to WAFB radio and TV in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he served in a variety of on-air roles. He covered sports for the radio station, covering the minor league baseball team Baton Rouge Red Sticks and the LSU Tigers football and basketball teams as well as some rodeo events. WAFB promoted a weekly wrestling match, and Schonely became the ring announcer. Schonely filled in as a referee, which eventually led to participating in matches on a tag team.

===Seattle===

Schonely moved to Seattle in 1956 and joined KOMO radio and then moved over to KOMO-TV, where he worked with future ABC Sports broadcaster Keith Jackson. Once again, Schonely found work in professional wrestling, although he did not pursue it as a career. Schonely also called roller derby games for KTNT-TV.

In 1957, Schonely suggested to Keith Allen, then player-coach for the Seattle Totems of the Western Hockey League, that their games be televised and that he should call them. A skeptical Allen agreed, if Schonely could find sponsors. Schonely enlisted friends including a funeral home director, optometrist and restaurateur to sponsor, and KOMO-TV broadcast Totems games on Sunday nights. Schonely called Totems games for 11 years on television and radio, and the team became popular in Seattle for a time.

In one incident during a game against the San Francisco Seals at the Cow Palace, an obnoxious fan would hit a siren every time the Seals made a good play, and eventually held the siren up to Schonely&#x27;s ear. Going to a commercial, Schonely announced: &quot;By the time I get back on the air, this guy is going to have a knuckle sandwich.&quot; Schonely put his headset down, turned around and slugged him. Security took the man away, and Schonely returned to the air, saying: &quot;He got his knuckle sandwich, folks.&quot;

Schonely moved to KAYO radio in 1959, and the Totems came with him. However, the station switched to a country and western format, and Schonely left the station. Schonely worked as public relations director for Longacres Race Track before returning to broadcasting as sports director for KVI. Schonely brought the Totems to the station, called games for the Washington Huskies and baseball games for the Pacific Coast League Seattle Angels. At that time, the PCL stretched from Hawaii to Little Rock, and the station could not cover all games. Instead, Schonely would receive updates from a reporter at the game via teletype, play sound effects to simulate crowd noise, and call the game as if he were actually present. In 1967, Schonely did West Coast National Hockey League coverage for CBS. Schonely also called major league Seattle Pilots games for the one year they played before moving to Milwaukee.

In 1967, Schonely nearly became the radio voice for the Seattle SuperSonics, newly created by NBA expansion. Dick Vertlieb, the team&#x27;s first general manager, offered the job to Schonely, who was not an avid NBA fan then. Schonely accepted, but was pushed aside at the behest of Union Oil of California, a key sponsor who wanted Bob Blackburn, who was the Sonics&#x27; radio voice until the early 1990s.

==Portland Trail Blazers==

===Early years===

In April 1970, Schonely was approached by Blazers co-founder Harry Glickman, whom Schonely knew as a founder of the Portland Buckaroos. Schonely was the organization&#x27;s sixth hire. Said Glickman in a 2008 interview: &quot;The interview only lasted a few minutes; he opened his mouth and I knew I had the right guy.&quot;

Schonely moved to Portland to start with the team on July 1, 1970. Schonely&#x27;s first task was to assemble a radio network, starting with Portland&#x27;s KOIN as the flagship, and Blazer games were carried on six stations during the first year. Schonely was not as familiar with basketball as with other sports, and had to work hard to learn the game, attending every practice early on. 

Schonely called the play-by-play on 2,522 Blazers radio and television broadcasts, from Portland&#x27;s very first preseason outing (September 24, 1970) to the team&#x27;s appearance in the 1998 NBA Playoffs (April 30, 1998).

Schonely&#x27;s announcing streak was interrupted only once, when he missed the first 25 games of the 1982–83 season for heart bypass surgery following a heart attack.

In 2003, Schonely returned to the team to appear in radio and television segments and act as a team ambassador at charity and community events.

===Return to the Blazers===
In 2003, Schonely was rehired by the Trail Blazers&#x27; new management, a move aimed at reconnecting with Blazers fans disenchanted by the previous management and players&#x27; off-court troubles. Schonely&#x27;s role included hosting pre-game segments, &quot;Memorable Moments&quot; on television and &quot;Blazers Flashback&quot; on radio, plus appearances in advertisements and at community events. Team president Steve Patterson called the move &quot;smart business&quot; and intended to honor the team&#x27;s past.

The move followed general manager Bob Whitsitt&#x27;s resignation in May. Asked whether he would have responded had the call come from Whitsitt, Schonely said at the time, &quot;Probably not.&quot;

On October 14, 2009, at age 80, Schonely returned to the microphone for the second half of a &quot;throwback&quot; exhibition game held at Portland&#x27;s Memorial Coliseum, where the Blazers played from 1970 until 1995. The occasion was billed as a one-quarter tribute, but radio announcer Brian Wheeler let Schonely call the remainder of the game.

Schonely&#x27;s Trail Blazers business card reads, &quot;Ambassador&quot;.

==Portland Beavers==

In 2000, Schonely signed a five-year deal to be the play-by-play announcer with the newest incarnation of the Portland Beavers Triple-A franchise, relocated from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like the original Blazers job, the Beavers offer came from Harry Glickman, this time on behalf of then-Beavers owner Portland Family Entertainment, run by Glickman&#x27;s son. Schonely, who allowed that he was open to a future role with the Blazers, called games for the Beavers through the 2002 PCL season.

While announcing Beavers games, Schonely made use of his famous phrases. Adapted for baseball use, &quot;Lickety brindle up the middle&quot; meant a base hit going past the pitcher&#x27;s mound into center field, &quot;Bingo, bango, bongo&quot; was used on 5–4–3 double plays. More occasionally, Schonely deployed &quot;Rip City&quot; for an outstanding and important play.

==Other work==

Schonely has recorded television advertisements for Standard TV &amp; Appliance and other businesses in the Portland area and has served as emcee of the former Fred Meyer Challenge charity golf tournament.

==Popularity==

According to Oregon sportswriter Kerry Eggers, fans consider Schonely &quot;the one constant link with Oregon&#x27;s only major-league team.&quot;

NBA trainer Ron Culp said of Schonely in 1990, &quot;Bill Schonely is the symbol of the love affair the fans have with the Trail Blazers. ... He&#x27;s part of their immediate family. Everything else with the Blazers have changed over the past 20 years, but you just don&#x27;t mess with the Schonz.&quot;

Schonely is often compared to legendary announcers Chick Hearn and Johnny Most, of the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, respectively. At Schonely&#x27;s induction to the 2002 Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, former Blazers center Bill Walton said: &quot;Bill Schonely is as important to sports in the Northwest as Chick Hearn was to sports in Southern California. There are very few people in the history of Western Civilization who have had that kind of an impact.&quot; Walton also said: &quot;Bill Schonely is the most important figure in the history of Oregon sports, with all due respect to Phil Knight and Maurice Lucas. Bill Schonely is the man who convinced people that sports are worthwhile.&quot;

A restaurant in the Rose Garden is named in his honor, the Pyramid Taproom at Schonely&#x27;s Place.

The Trail Blazers organization retired Schonely&#x27;s microphone on November 3, 2003.

The 1992 Public Enemy album &quot;Greatest Misses&quot; features the voice of Schonely calling Trail Blazer games, on the track &quot;Air Hoodlum.&quot;

===Signature phrases===

Schonely coined or popularized numerous phrases and sayings during his radio career with the Blazers, which have become synonymous with the Blazermania phenomenon in Oregon, including &quot;Rip City&quot;, &quot;Bingo Bango Bongo&quot;, &quot;Climb the golden ladder&quot;, &quot;Lickety brindle up the middle&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve got to make your free throws.&quot;

Schonely&#x27;s best-known phrase, &quot;Rip City&quot;, debuted in a game against the Lakers in 1970. The Blazers had fallen behind by a significant margin, yet rallied back to a two-point deficit. When a long jump shot by guard Jim Barnett tied the game, Schonely blurted out, &quot;Rip City! All right!&quot; an exhortation for which Schonely had no literal explanation. The Blazers lost 136–114 but the phrase stuck, became synonymous with Blazers basketball and even became a nickname for Portland itself.

Schonely is also known for the opening line of each broadcast, &quot;Good evening basketball fans, wherever you may be...&quot; delivered in some variation since the beginning of his professional sportscasting career in Baton Rouge.

===Recognition===

In 1999, Schonely was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for Broadcasting.

In 2012, Schonely was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Basketball Hall of Fame.

===Personal life and death===
Schonely and his first wife Barbara had four children; they divorced in 1967. Their son Steven died of cancer in 2012. Schonely and his second wife, Dorothy &quot;Dottie&quot; Kehr, were childhood sweethearts, reconnecting at their 50th high school reunion years after his divorce and her husband&#x27;s death; they married on March 16, 1991. His philanthropic work included association with the American Heart Association, Life Flight, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Providence Child Center Foundation. He sang in his church choir, played golf and liked to listen to big-band music.

Schonely died in Portland on January 21, 2023, at the age of 93.

<doc id="864858" wikidata="Q751562" url="?curid=864858" title="Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Belfast East is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Gavin Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

==Boundaries==

The seat was created in 1922 when, under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the number of seats in Northern Ireland in the Westminster Parliament was cut from 30 to 13, following the establishment of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The seat is centred on the east section of Belfast and also contains part of the district of Lisburn and Castlereagh.

Prior to the 2010 general election the Northern Ireland Boundary Commission proposed expanding Belfast East further into Castlereagh, taking in areas currently contained in Strangford, however almost all of these areas were part of Belfast East until 1983. A small part of the constituency was proposed for transfer to Belfast South.

Following a public meeting and revised recommendations, the new boundaries of Belfast East were confirmed by the commission and passed through Parliament through the use of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order.

== History ==
Belfast East is an overwhelmingly unionist constituency with nationalist parties routinely failing to get more than 10% of the vote combined. The main interest has been the contest between unionist parties and the fortunes of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland.

Dominated by the giant Samson and Goliath cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the constituency is socially mixed. There are large expanses of small Victorian terraced housing near Belfast City Centre and around the shipyard in Ballymacarrett. These areas have seen significant refurbishment, and in some places demolition and redevelopment, in recent years sparking a sharp rise in house prices. This is contrasted by a large amount of solidly lower-middle class housing and some exclusive residential districts such as the much mocked Cherryvalley. This social polarisation is to a large degree reflected by the political polarisation, at least within the broader unionist family, in the seat. The small Catholic population is split between the largely working class Short Strand enclave and minorities in the more middle-class parts of the seat.

The seat was consistently held by the Ulster Unionist Party until the 1974 general election when the sitting MP, Stanley McMaster, defended it as a Pro-Assembly Unionist against a united anti-Sunningdale Agreement coalition which nominated William Craig of the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party. Craig won the seat and held it for five years, moving to the UUP in February 1978.

In the 1979 general election the constituency witnessed a very close three-way fight between Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party, William Craig for the UUP and Oliver Napier for the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. Less than 1000 votes separated the three candidates. Robinson beat Craig by the narrow margin of 64 votes. Also of note was that over 90% of votes went to parties that had not contested the seat at the previous election – in part due to realignments of the parties.

Robinson continued to hold the seat but the Alliance Party continued to poll well, and in 1987 John Alderdice polled 32.1% – the highest ever for Alliance in a Westminster election before 2010. However, their vote declined until 2010 and in 2005 they finished a distant third.

In the 2001 general election, Alliance proposed a pro-Good Friday Agreement pact with the Ulster Unionist Party in the hopes of getting UUP support in Belfast East. The UUP did not agree and so both parties stood. Robinson was re-elected with 42.5%, with the UUP, Alliance and Progressive Unionist Party carving up the pro-Agreement pro-union vote between them, but it is doubtful that an unopposed Alliance candidate could have consolidated all of that vote to beat Robinson.

In 2009 and 2010, Robinson became mired in a number of political scandals. In the 2010 general election, the Alliance Party candidate and sitting Lord Mayor of Belfast Naomi Long defeated Robinson in a shock result, more than tripling the Alliance vote and giving the Alliance their first seat in Westminster since 1974. Predictably, this was also the seat in which the Alliance gained the highest vote share, at 37.2%, more than double their best efforts elsewhere.

Of the 18 seats in the region, East Belfast has the highest percentage of Methodists. The 2019 winning vote share was the fourth-largest of the region, but just short of an absolute majority.

He was the son of Wilson Lowry and his second wife Rebecca Delvalle and was born on 7 October 1803. His mother&#x27;s sister, Abigail, was mother of the economist David Ricardo. He was trained by his father and from both parents inherited a taste for science and mathematics; in his work he specialised in scientific subjects. He died, unmarried, at his residence, 39 Robert Street, Hampstead Road, London, on 15 June 1879.

He engraved plates for the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; and for Sir John Rennie a series of drawings for London Bridge. Other work included John Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Geology of Yorkshire&quot;, 1835 and Scott Russell&#x27;s &quot;Naval Architecture&quot;, 1865, John Weale&#x27;s &#x27;Scientific Series&#x27; and the journals of the Institution of Naval Architects and the Royal Geographical Society.
