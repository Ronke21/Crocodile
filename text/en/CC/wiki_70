<text>A backlot is an area behind or adjoining a movie studio containing permanent exterior buildings for outdoor scenes in filmmaking or television productions, or space for temporary set construction.

==Uses==

Some movie studios build a wide variety of sets on the backlot, which can be modified for different purposes as need requires and &quot;dressed&quot; to resemble any time period or look. These sets include everything from mountains, forests, ships, to small-town settings from around the world, as well as streets from the Old West, to whole modern-day city blocks from New York City, Paris, Berlin, and London. There are streets that comprise an assortment of architectural styles, Victorian to suburban homes, and 19th century-style townhouses that encircle a central park with trees. An example of this is (the former) Warner Bros. Ranch in Burbank, California seen in the title sequence of &quot;Friends&quot; or, in the case of Universal Studios, the home of Norman Bates from the Hitchcock movie &quot;Psycho&quot;.

The shells, or façades, on a studio backlot are usually constructed with three sides and a roof, often missing the back wall and/or one of the side walls. The interior is an unfinished space, with no rooms, and from the back of the structure one can see the electrical wires, pipes, beams and scaffolding, which are fully exposed. Ladders are usually built into the structure, allowing performers to climb to an upper-floor window or the roof to perform scenes. Not all the buildings and houses are shells. Some are closed in with a fourth wall. When not otherwise in use, they serve as storage facilities for lighting and other production equipment. When in use, the structures are dressed by adding doors, window treatments and landscaping. L-shaped temporary walls are placed inside of doors to give the illusion of an interior. When not in use, the structures are usually stripped of this dressing.

Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; offers a rare look into the Warner Bros. backlot, with scenes spilling off the Laramie Street set into various stages and eventually out of Gate 3 onto Olive Avenue in Burbank, California. Television shows such as &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; also broke the fourth wall and gave audiences a peek at life on the other side of the camera.

All the sets on a studio backlot are built to appear large, as if covering miles of ground on the big or small screen, while actually occupying only a few acres of the backlot.

At their peak, some backlots covered hundreds of acres around existing studios, and filmmakers rarely left the lot, as they would intercut the backlot shots with a handful of establishing shots filmed on location by a second unit.

==Demise==
Today many studio backlots are gone or nearly gone. There are several reasons for this. Los Angeles, like the rest of the United States, went through an economic boom after World War II. This caused real estate prices (and property taxes linked to fair market value) to rise dramatically.

At the same time, during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (the period when Hollywood underwent the transition from the Golden Age to New Hollywood), global movie audiences were increasingly irritated by films which were supposedly set all over the world, but obviously had been filmed in California. The primitive special effects technology of the era made it difficult to remove clear signs that a film had been shot in California, such as chaparral-covered hills at the horizon line. Audiences wanted to see actors in locations which were both exotic and authentic, not cheap Hollywood facsimiles. The mediocre box office performance of the 1967 film &quot;Camelot&quot; was blamed in part on this issue, which in turn marked the end of large-scale backlot production in Southern California.

By the early 1970s, the industry had transitioned to location shooting for the majority of outdoor scenes, and backlots were widely viewed as an obsolete, unwanted capital expenditure and a tax burden on studios. Many were razed and the land was either sold to developers or repurposed for theme parks (e.g., Universal Studios Hollywood) or office buildings (e.g., Century City). Since the late 1990s, the increased use of CGI and blue/green screen effects in big budget movies has accelerated the decline in the use of studio backlots, as more films are shot completely indoors.

<doc id="864337" wikidata="Q5353701" url="?curid=864337" title="Elbert D. Thomas">
<text>Elbert Duncan Thomas (June 17, 1883February 11, 1953) was a Democratic Party politician from Utah. He represented Utah in the United States Senate from 1933 until 1951. He served as the Chair of the Senate Education Committee, and is the last Democrat to serve as Utah&#x27;s Class 3 Senator.

==Biography==
Thomas was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, on June 17, 1883, to Caroline Stockdale and Richard Kendall Thomas. He was the fifth of 12 children. His parents loved the arts, especially the theater. They built the first Children&#x27;s Playhouse west of the Mississippi River in a barn on their property, which they named the Barnacle. Elbert was involved in many plays held for the public in the Barnacle. His father was involved in local government and held conventions and political rallies at the Barnacle. His family later moved to a home across from what is now the Conference Center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). This home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While an undergraduate student at the University of Utah, Thomas helped found the Amici Fidissimi Society in 1902. The AF Society was a men&#x27;s fraternal organization which later affiliated with Phi Delta Theta fraternity, an international college fraternity, in 1914, becoming the Utah Alpha chapter of the Fraternity. Elbert was the first initiate into Phi Delta Theta at the University of Utah.

Thomas married Edna Harker on June 25, 1907, in the Salt Lake Temple and they had three daughters together. Edna died in 1942, and Elbert later married Ethel Evans in 1946 in the Salt Lake Temple.

==Church service==
Thomas served a mission to Japan for the LDS Church with his first wife, from 1907 to 1912. He was one of the first LDS missionaries sent to Japan, and his first daughter, Chiyo, was born there. Elbert developed a deep love for the Japanese people and learned to speak Japanese fluently. He was the author of &quot;Sukui No Michi&quot;, the Japanese translation of the Mormon tract &quot;Way of Salvation&quot;. For part of his five-year mission, Thomas was the president of the Japanese Mission. On his return from Japan, he became a Professor of Political Science and History at the University of Utah (where he had received his B.A. in 1906). He taught Latin, Greek and Japanese culture, as well as being a Political Science and History professor and eventually an Administrator on the Board of Regents at the University of Utah for many years.

==Political office==
Thomas was first elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1932, defeating Republican Reed Smoot. He served on the Committee on Education and Labor (of which he was the Chairman), the Committee on Military Affairs, the Mines and Mining Committee, and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.

In April 1943 a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by British scholar Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office characterized Thomas as:
Thomas was among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year. He served three terms before being defeated for reelection by Wallace F. Bennett in 1950. In 1951, he was appointed High Commissioner over the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Elbert died in Honolulu, Hawaii Territory, on February 11, 1953. He was buried in the Thomas family plot in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The Gibbs-Thomas House, in Salt Lake City, which was Thomas&#x27;s sole residence in Utah, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 in large part to recognize his association.

<text>Ian Kennedy Martin (born 23 May 1936) is a British television scriptwriter who created the action drama series &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975–78).

== Career ==
He began his television career in the 1960s, first as a script editor on the military police drama series &quot;Redcap&quot; (1964) and then later as a writer on series such as &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot; (1965). In 1971 he worked on the popular BBC drama series &quot;The Onedin Line&quot;, which ran for nine years until 1980.

He also wrote the 1974 drama series &quot;The Capone Investment&quot;. He is best known for creating the popular police action drama series &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, produced by Euston Films for Thames Television, which ran on the ITV network from 1975 to 1978. It also spawned two feature film spin-offs. He is also known for writing the 1975 action film &quot;Mitchell&quot;.

Since the end of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; in 1978, Kennedy Martin has continued to write for various police and detective dramas. These have included the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; and &quot;The Chinese Detective&quot; during the 1980s and ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Knock&quot; in the 1990s.

<doc id="864347" wikidata="Q361927" url="?curid=864347" title="Joshua Redman">
<text>Joshua Redman (born February 1, 1969) is an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He is the son of jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman (1931–2006).

==Life and career==
Joshua Redman was born in Berkeley, California, to jazz saxophonist Dewey Redman and dancer and librarian Renee Shedroff. He is Jewish. He was exposed to many kinds of music at the Center for World Music in Berkeley, where his mother studied South Indian dance. Some of his earliest lessons in music and improvisation were on recorder with gamelan player Jody Diamond. He was exposed at an early age to a variety of musics and instruments and began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to what became his primary instrument, the tenor saxophone, one year later. Redman has said he is self-taught on the saxophone and has cited John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Cannonball Adderley, his father Dewey Redman, as well as the Beatles, Aretha Franklin, The Temptations, Earth, Wind and Fire, Prince, The Police and Led Zeppelin as musical influences.

Redman graduated from Berkeley High School, class of 1986, after having been a part of the award-winning Berkeley High School Jazz Ensemble for all four years of high school. After graduation, Joshua frequented the classroom jam sessions of Bay Area pianist and professor of music (at Laney College in Oakland, California), Ed Kelly. It was there that he performed alongside saxophonist Robert Stewart.

In 1991, he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Social Studies from Harvard University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa Society. He had already been accepted by Yale Law School, but deferred entrance for what he believed was only going to be one year. Some of his friends had recently relocated to Brooklyn, and they were looking for another housemate to help with the rent. Redman accepted their invitation to move in, and almost immediately he found himself immersed in the New York jazz scene. He began jamming and gigging regularly with some of the leading jazz musicians of his generation and that of his father, including Brad Mehldau, Peter Martin, Mark Turner, Peter Bernstein, Roy Hargrove, Christian McBride, Kevin Hays, Jorge Rossy, Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins, among others.

Redman won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Saxophone Competition in 1991, and began focusing on his musical career. He was signed by Warner Bros. Records and issued his first self-titled album in the spring of 1993, which subsequently earned Redman his first Grammy nomination. He continued to develop his style throughout the 1990s, beginning with a sideman appearance on Elvin Jones&#x27; &quot;Youngblood&quot; alongside Javon Jackson, and following up with an appearance on his father Dewey&#x27;s 1992 record &quot;Choices&quot;. On his second album as a leader, &quot;Wish&quot;, he was joined by a notable lineup consisting of guitarist Pat Metheny, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins; this group then toured as &quot;The Joshua Redman Quartet&quot;, featuring Christian McBride in place of Charlie Haden. He continued to work with various quartets, including one with pianist Brad Mehldau until forming a new trio, &quot;Elastic&quot;, with keyboardist Sam Yahel and drummer Brian Blade. The trio debuted under the moniker &quot;Yaya3&quot;, producing one album under this name. The same group of musicians made up the core on Redman&#x27;s &quot;Elastic&quot; album, before becoming known as the &quot;Joshua Redman Elastic Band&quot;. Some of his works were featured on The Weather Channel&#x27;s &quot;Local on the 8s&quot;. Redman performed in a fictitious supergroup, &quot;The Louisiana Gator Boys&quot;, in the 1998 film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, performing on &quot;How Blue Can You Get?&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot;. Redman also appeared alongside Roy Hargrove and others on a series of albums released in the 1990s on RCA Novus by the Jazz Networks, an ensemble of American and Japanese musicians who focused on re-interpreting jazz standards primarily for the Japanese market. 

===2000s===
In 1999, Joshua Redman was immortalized in the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Arthur&quot; on PBS. He appeared in the tenth episode of the fourth season (&quot;My Music Rules&quot;), where it was rumored by the characters that he would get in a fight with famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who also appeared in the episode. Instead, when the two meet they are revealed to be fans of each other&#x27;s music and collaborate together on a song to entertain children.

In 2000, Redman was named Artistic Director for the Spring Season of the non-profit jazz-presenting organization SFJAZZ. Redman co-founded the SFJAZZ with Executive Director Randall Kline, as the SFJAZZ Collective, an ensemble distinguished by the creativity of its members and a primary emphasis on composition.
In 2004, Redman first sat in with Umphrey&#x27;s McGee at their performance in Boston, Massachusetts, at the Paradise Rock Club. Redman has collaborated with Umphrey&#x27;s McGee around 20 times since, including an all-improvised set in Madison, Wisconsin in January 2016.

In 2006, he performed with the New Zealand Symphony orchestra in composer John Psathas&#x27; concerto for saxophone and drumkit, Omnifenix, which was released in Rattle Records&#x27; album, View from Olympus. The album won Best Classical Album for 2007 in the New Zealand music awards.

In March 2007, Redman announced that he was taking a hiatus from both the SFJAZZ Artistic Directorship and the SFJAZZ Collective in order to focus on new projects. In April 2007, Nonesuch released Redman&#x27;s first ever piano-less trio record, &quot;Back East&quot;, featuring Joshua alongside three bass and drum rhythm sections (Larry Grenadier &amp; Ali Jackson, Christian McBride &amp; Brian Blade, Reuben Rogers &amp; Eric Harland) and three guest saxophonists (Chris Cheek, Joe Lovano and Dewey Redman). His January 2009 release, &quot;Compass&quot;, continued the trio tradition, and even included some tracks with a double-trio setup, featuring saxophone, two basses and two drummers.

===2010s===
Starting in late 2009, Redman began performing with a new collaborative band called James Farm, featuring pianist Aaron Parks, bassist Matt Penman and drummer Eric Harland. They released their first self-titled album on April 26, 2011 and their follow-up album, &quot;City Folk&quot; on October 27, 2014.

In 2011, Redman was also an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards&#x27; judging panel to support independent artists.

In early 2013, it was announced that Redman would release a new collection of vintage and contemporary ballads featuring a jazz quartet and an orchestral ensemble titled &quot;Walking Shadows.&quot; Produced by Redman&#x27;s friend and frequent collaborator Brad Mehldau, the album also features Larry Grenadier (bass) and Brian Blade (drums). It was released on May 7, 2013 on Nonesuch. About Walking Shadows, the New York Times says &quot;there hasn’t been a more sublimely lyrical gesture in his 20-year recording career.&quot;

On Sunday, December 8, 2013, Redman joined a group of jazz all-stars onstage at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., to pay tribute to honoree Herbie Hancock in performance. The event aired on December 29, 2013 on CBS.

In 2015, Redman received his third Grammy nomination for his solo on &quot;Friend or Foe&quot; from the album &quot;The Bad Plus Joshua Redman&quot;.

In addition to his own projects, Redman has recorded and performed with musicians including Joey Alexander, Brian Blade, Ray Brown, Dave Brubeck, Chick Corea, The Dave Matthews Band, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Frisell, Aaron Goldberg, Larry Goldings, Charlie Haden, Herbie Hancock, Roy Hargrove, Roy Haynes, Billie Higgins, Milt Jackson, Elvin Jones, Quincy Jones, Big Daddy Kane, Geoff Keezer, B.B.

<text>Herbert Horatio Nichols (January 3, 1919 – April 12, 1963) was an American jazz pianist and composer who wrote the jazz standard &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;. Obscure during his lifetime, he is now highly regarded by many musicians and critics.

==Life==
He was born in San Juan Hill, Manhattan, New York, United States, to parents from St. Kitts and Trinidad, and grew up in Harlem. During much of his career, he took work as a Dixieland musician while also pursuing the more adventurous kind of jazz he preferred. He is best known today for music that combines bop, Dixieland, and music from the Caribbean with harmonies from Erik Satie, Béla Bartók and other modernist composers.

His first known work as a musician was with the Royal Barons in 1937, but he did not find performing at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse a few years later a very happy experience, as the competitive environment did not suit him. However, he did become friends with pianist Thelonious Monk.

Nichols was drafted into the Army in 1941. After the war, he worked in various settings, beginning to achieve some recognition when Mary Lou Williams recorded some of his songs in 1952. From about 1947, he persisted in trying to persuade Alfred Lion at Blue Note Records to sign him up. He finally recorded some of his compositions for Blue Note in 1955 and 1956, some of which were not issued until the 1980s. His tune &quot;Serenade&quot; had lyrics added, and as &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; became identified with Billie Holiday. In 1957, he recorded his last album as leader for Bethlehem Records.

Nichols died of leukemia in New York City at the age of 44.

One of the four essays in A.B. Spellman&#x27;s &quot;Four Lives in the Bebop Business&quot; (also known as &quot;Four Jazz Lives&quot;, 1966) is about Nichols. A biography, &quot;Herbie Nichols: A Jazzist&#x27;s Life,&quot; written by Mark Miller, was published in 2009.

==Influence==
Nichols&#x27;s music was energetically promoted by Roswell Rudd, who worked with Nichols in the early 1960s. Rudd released three albums featuring Nichols&#x27;s compositions (Regeneration, issued in 1983 by Soul Note, and &quot;The Unheard Herbie Nichols&quot; (1997), issued by CIMP in two volumes), as well as a book &quot;The Unpublished Works&quot; (2000).

In 1984, the Steve Lacy quintet with George E. Lewis, Misha Mengelberg, Han Bennink, and Arjen Gorter performed the music of Nichols at the Ravenna Jazz Festival in Italy. That same year, they recorded an album titled &quot;Change of Season (Music of Herbie Nichols)&quot; (Soul Note, 1985).

A New York group, the Herbie Nichols Project (part of the Jazz Composers Collective) has recorded three albums largely dedicated to unrecorded Nichols&#x27; compositions, many of which Nichols had deposited in the Library of Congress.

In 2024, Sonic Camera Records released &quot;Tell the Birds I Said Hello: The Music of Herbie Nichols&quot;, an album by double bassist Ben Allison, guitarist Steve Cardenas, and saxophonist Ted Nash.

<text>Wallace Foster Bennett (November 13, 1898 – December 19, 1993) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a US Senator from Utah from 1951 to 1974. He was the father of Bob Bennett, who later held his father&#x27;s seat in the Senate.

==Early life and education==
Wallace Bennett was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to John Foster and Rosetta Elizabeth (née Wallace) Bennett. His grandparents were English immigrants who came to the United States in 1868. He received his early education at local public schools and graduated from LDS High School in 1916. He then enrolled at the University of Utah, where he majored in English and won a varsity letter in debate.

Bennett, a member of the university&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, interrupted his college education to serve in the US Army during World War I. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant of the Infantry in September 1918 and was assigned as an instructor in the Student Army Training Corps at Colorado College. He later returned to the University of Utah and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1919. For a year after his graduation, he served as principal of San Luis Stake Academy in Manassa, Colorado.

==Family==
In 1922, Bennett married Frances Marion Grant, the youngest daughter of Heber J. Grant (who served as President of the LDS Church from 1918 to 1945). The couple had three sons, Wallace, David, and Robert; and two daughters, Rosemary and Frances.

Frances served for a time as a member of the Primary General Board of the LDS Church.

==Business career==
In 1920, Bennett returned to Salt Lake City and became an office clerk at Bennett&#x27;s Paint and Glass Company, which his father had established. He was later advanced to cashier, production manager, and sales manager. He became secretary-treasurer of the company in 1929 and, after his father&#x27;s death in 1938, became president and general manager. He served in that position until 1950, when he became chairman of the board. In 1938, the company completed what Bennett described as the most modern paint manufacturing plant in the West.

In addition to his work in his family&#x27;s business, Bennett organized a Ford dealership, the Bennett Motor Company, and served as its president from 1939 to 1950. He also served as president of the Cardon Jewelry Company and of the National Glass Distributors Association; vice-president of Glayton Investment Company and of the National Paint, Varnish and Lacquer Association; and director of Zion&#x27;s Savings Bank and Trust Company, the Utah Oil Refining Company, and the Utah Home Fire Insurance Company. In 1949, he was elected president of the National Association of Manufacturers. He spent his year-long tenure as president traveling the country and preached &quot;the partnership of the men who put up the money, the men who do the work, and the men who tie the whole thing together.&quot;

He hosted a daily one-hour program, &quot;The Observatory Hour&quot;, on KSL (1932–1933), and was president of the Salt Lake Civic Opera Company (1938–1941) and the Salt Lake Community Chest (1944–1945). In 1935, he became treasurer of the Latter-day Saints Sunday School General Board. He directed the chorus of student nurses of LDS Hospital (1942–1948) and wrote the words to &quot;God of Power, God of Right&quot;, which is Hymn #20 in the 1985 Latter-day Saints Hymnal. He authored &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot; (1950) and &quot;Why I am a Mormon&quot; (1958).

==US Senate==
In March 1950, Bennett announced his candidacy for a seat in the US Senate from Utah. After receiving the Republican nomination, he faced three-term Democratic incumbent Elbert D. Thomas in the general election. During the campaign, he accused Thomas of having communist positions and circulated pamphlets associating Thomas with communist organizations and figures. In November, he defeated Thomas by a margin of 54%–46%. He was subsequently re-elected to three more terms.

===Silver problem===
In the late 1950s, the US Treasury became a begrudging supplier of silver at $0.905 an ounce. Bennett warned that the lack of supply for the high demand would cause the deficit to fall on the Treasury Stocks. By 1961, the Treasury Stocks had unnecessarily been depleted. In 1963, the government had only 30 million ounces of free silver, but the annual coinage requirement for the United States was more than 75 million ounces. The price of silver per ounce was now $1.2929, but if the United States bought extra silver, the price would go above $1.29. The Silver Purchase Act of 1963 was supported by Bennett and repealed &quot;existing silver purchase requirements and the transfer of tax of silver bullion.&quot; It also allowed the Federal Reserve to issue $1 and $2 notes to replace &quot;silver certificates or the denominations thus making 1.6 billion ounces of silver available to the United States Treasury.&quot;

Bennett spoke at the Convention of the American Mining Congress in 1963 that declared the coin and silver problem had reached a catastrophic level. His views were faced with much criticism. Two years later, to function properly, the Treasury proposed a new set of coins. Bennett joined forces with the administration and worked on a solution, the Coinage Act of 1965, which he got through Congress to be enacted into law.

===Leadership===
During his 23 years in the Senate, Bennett earned a reputation as a conservative and a pro-business advocate by opposing government regulations and supporting right-to-work laws. He served as a member of the Senate Finance and Banking and Currency Committees, as well as the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and Defense Production. Bennett was the vice chairman of Senate Ethics Committee. Bennett voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the US Supreme Court, but Bennett did not vote on the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He also supported a measure that prohibited federal aid to schools that practiced racial discrimination. He opposed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the creation of Medicare. He also voted against the Equal Rights Amendment. He was also instrumental in bringing the Central Utah Project and the defense and aerospace industries to Utah. By the end of his political career, Bennett was the ranking Republican on Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. He was &quot;recognized as one of the nations leading fiscal and monetary experts.&quot;

Bennett declined to seek re-election in 1974 and resigned on December 20 of that year to let his elected successor, Jake Garn, take office early and gain seniority.

==Later life==
After his departure from the Senate, Bennett returned to Salt Lake City, resumed his business pursuits, and served on a variety of boards. When his son Robert was elected to his former Senate seat in 1992, the elder Bennett said, &quot;Bob and I have made Utah history. We are the first father and son combination to be elected to the U.S. Senate in this state.&quot;

Bennett died at his home in Salt Lake City at the age of 95. He is buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

<doc id="864359" wikidata="Q169175" url="?curid=864359" title="Cabo da Roca">
<text>Cabo da Roca () or Cape Roca is a cape which forms the westernmost point of the Sintra Mountain Range, of mainland Portugal, of continental Europe, and of the Eurasian landmass. It is situated in the municipality of Sintra, near Azóia, in the south west of the Lisbon District. Notably, the point includes a lighthouse that started operation in 1772.

==History==
Cabo da Roca was known to the Romans as &quot;Promontorium Magnum&quot; and during the Age of Sail as the Rock of Lisbon.

=== Lighthouse ===
==Geography==


The cape is within the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, 42 kilometres west of the city of Lisbon and in the southwest of Sintra. A location () is inscribed on a stone plaque, located on a monument at the site.

The western coast is a mixture of sandy beaches and rocky cliff promontories: around Cabo da Roca, cliffs are more than 100 metres in height, and cut into crystalline rocks, composed of strongly folded and faulted sedimentary units. These forms are disturbed by dikes and small beaches. This promontory of &quot;high&quot; beaches is the extreme western immersion of the ancient eruptive Sintra massif, as evident from the rose-coloured granite in the north and syenite of the Ribeira do Louriçal in the south. In the vicinity of the Cape, there are geomorphological examples of gabbro-diorite, volcanic breccia, and granite.

Part of the granite formations show evidence of strong coastal erosion, while in other areas there are limestone deposits embedded in the granite.

Much of the vegetation on this cape is low-lying and adapted to saltwater and windy conditions. Once home to a variety of plant life, Cabo da Roca has been overrun with the invasive plant species &quot;Carpobrotus edulis&quot;. This creeping, mat-forming plant, a member of the Aizoaceae succulent family, was introduced as ground cover by local residents several decades ago, but now covers much of the arable land on Cabo da Roca.

Many migratory and marine birds roost temporarily along the cliffs and protected coves of the coastal area.

===Climate===
The climate present at Cape Roca is extremely moderated by the ocean. Due to seasonal upwelling, the area comprising the cape has cool, stable summers with little to no rainfall but very common occurrences of fog which boosts the humidity and decreases insolation. Summer is also the windiest season of the year with July and August averaging around . On the other hand, winters are rainy and have mild temperatures especially during the night, though the amount of precipitation received in this season is unparalleled with other places nearby such as the Sintra Mountains which can receive triple that precipitation. Due to the seasonal lag, September is the warmest month.

<text>In computing, dataflow is a broad concept, which has various meanings depending on the application and context. In the context of software architecture, data flow relates to stream processing or reactive programming.

==Software architecture==
Dataflow computing is a software paradigm based on the idea of representing computations as a directed graph, where nodes are computations and data flow along the edges. Dataflow can also be called stream processing or reactive programming.

There have been multiple data-flow/stream processing languages of various forms (see Stream processing). Data-flow hardware (see Dataflow architecture) is an alternative to the classic von Neumann architecture. The most obvious example of data-flow programming is the subset known as reactive programming with spreadsheets. As a user enters new values, they are instantly transmitted to the next logical &quot;actor&quot; or formula for calculation.

Distributed data flows have also been proposed as a programming abstraction that captures the dynamics of distributed multi-protocols. The data-centric perspective characteristic of data flow programming promotes high-level functional specifications and simplifies formal reasoning about system components.

==Hardware architecture==

Hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in computer architecture research in the 1970s and early 1980s. Jack Dennis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures. Designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines. These machines did not allow multiple instances of the same routines to be executed simultaneously because the simple tags could not differentiate between them. Designs that use content-addressable memory are called dynamic dataflow machines by Arvind. They use tags in memory to facilitate parallelism.
Data flows around the computer through the components of the computer. It gets entered from the input devices and can leave through output devices (printer etc.).

==Concurrency==
A dataflow network is a network of concurrently executing processes or automata that can communicate by sending data over &quot;channels&quot; (see message passing.)

In Kahn process networks, named after Gilles Kahn, the processes are &quot;determinate&quot;. This implies that each determinate process computes a continuous function from input streams to output streams, and that a network of determinate processes is itself determinate, thus computing a continuous function. This implies that the behavior of such networks can be described by a set of recursive equations, which can be solved using fixed point theory. The movement and transformation of the data is represented by a series of shapes and lines.

== Other meanings ==
Dataflow can also refer to:
* Power BI Dataflow, a Power Query implementation in the cloud used for transforming source data into cleansed Power BI Datasets to be used by Power BI report developers through the Microsoft Dataverse (formerly called Microsoft Common Data Service).
* Google Cloud Dataflow, a fully managed service for executing Apache Beam pipelines within the Google Cloud Platform ecosystem.

<text>The Chamber (1994) is a legal thriller written by American author John Grisham. It is Grisham&#x27;s fifth novel.

==Plot==

In 1967, in Greenville, Mississippi, the office of Jewish lawyer Marvin Kramer is bombed, injuring Kramer and killing his two young sons. Sam Cayhall, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, is identified, arrested and tried for their murders, committed in retaliation for Kramer&#x27;s involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. Sam&#x27;s first two trials, engineered by his Klan-connected lawyer, each end in a mistrial. Thirteen years later, the FBI pressures a suspected associate to testify against Sam at a third trial. Sam is convicted and sentenced to death by lethal gas. He is sent to the Mississippi State Penitentiary and placed on death row.

Now without a lawyer, Sam becomes a &quot;pro bono&quot; case for a team of anti-death penalty lawyers from the large—and Jewish—Chicago law firm of Kravitz and Bane. Representing Sam is his own grandson, Adam Hall, who travels to the firm&#x27;s Memphis office to aid Sam in the final month before his scheduled execution. Although lacking experience in death penalty cases, Adam is determined to argue a stay for his grandfather. Sam, despite his violent past, is one of the few living links to Adam&#x27;s family history. Sam&#x27;s alcoholic daughter, Lee Cayhall Booth, slowly reveals the family&#x27;s tragic past to her nephew, Adam.

Initially uncooperative, Sam eventually opens up to Adam and reveals a remarkable depth of hard-won legal knowledge, regularly preparing his own briefs and court motions. Despite his Klan past, he readily helps Black fellow prisoners as well as White ones. Adam interviews the FBI agent in charge of the original case and realizes that Sam almost certainly did not commit the actual crime for which he had been found guilty, although he was present. Nevertheless, Sam has a long and largely-secret history of Klan-related crimes, including several murders. Dogan, the associate who testified against Sam at his third trial, has apparently been murdered by the Klan. Sam himself will not reveal if another associate exists, thus not violating the Klan&#x27;s loyalty oath.

Adam desperately files motion after motion and argues some of them before judges. He seeks to persuade Mississippi&#x27;s governor to grant a reprieve, knowing full well that such a move is politically impossible; Sam forbids such a move, suspecting that the governor is using him for political gain. All appeals are finally exhausted. Sam is now repentant, but does not want Adam as a witness to the execution. He faces the last moment with courage and fortitude, publicly repudiating his past with the Klan, and dies proud of his grandson and happy to have forged a strong link with him during this last month. The sentence is carried out, Sam having ordered Adam to walk away and not watch him die.

With Sam and Dogan dead, no one knows that Roland, the third man who prepared and set off the bomb, is still free and living nearby under a false identity and observing the progress of the case—having graduated from Klan member to a full-fledged &quot;proud fascist&quot; and neo-Nazi. The reader knows—but Adam never does—that Roland stalked the young lawyer and considered killing him, but concluded it was not necessary and that Sam would take his secret to the grave. Meanwhile, Adam, sickened but fascinated by the experience—and disliking the idea of having a career as a corporate lawyer—quits Kravitz and Bane. Instead he accepts a poorly-paid position with a group of anti-death penalty lawyers.

==Lawsuit and dismissal==
Lawyer and author Polly Nelson sued Grisham in 1995, alleging &quot;The Chamber&quot; had striking similarities to &quot;Defending the Devil&quot;, her nonfiction book about her experiences as lawyer for serial killer Ted Bundy. After Grisham prevailed in a lower court ruling in 1996, the case was dismissed on appeal in 1997.

==Film adaptation==
In 1996, &quot;The Chamber&quot; was made into a feature film starring Gene Hackman and Chris O&#x27;Donnell.

<text>Punta de Tarifa (Tarifa Point) is the southernmost point of the Iberian Peninsula and Continental Europe. It is located in the province of Cádiz and the autonomous community of Andalusia on the Atlantic end of the Straits of Gibraltar. It is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Punta Marroquí&quot; (Moroccan Point), as the coast of Morocco can be seen from this point.

The point is the southeastern tip of the former island, known as Isla de Las Palomas, located offshore and now connected to the mainland by a causeway. The island had a military base between the 1930s and 2001.

The name of Tarifa, both for the island and for the municipality, originates from Tarif ibn Malik, who in 711 started here the Islamic conquest of Hispania.

<text>Arthur Frank Bergmann (born February 8, 1953, in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter who was one of the key figures in Canadian punk rock in the late 1970s. Bergmann was made a member of the Order of Canada in 2021.

==Punk bands==
Art Bergmann began his musical career with an Abbotsford band called the Mount Lehman Grease Band. After Mount Lehman folded, he founded his own band called the Notorious Smorg Brothers, which he stocked with a myriad of different support artists.

Bergmann was later the lead singer and songwriter for Vancouver punk stalwarts Young Canadians (formerly The K-Tels). Although the Young Canadians only recorded two independent EPs and a single before breaking up, their song &quot;Hawaii&quot; (co-written with Ross Carpenter) is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Although long out of print, the EPs, along with some unreleased live material, were reissued in 1995 as the album &quot;No Escape&quot;.

==Solo career==
In the 1980s, Bergmann played with Vancouver independent bands Los Popularos and Poisoned before the latter band signed to Duke Street Records in 1988. Due to confusion with the popular American band Poison which had marred the band&#x27;s most recent tour, however, the label decided to bill the band&#x27;s releases as solo albums by Bergmann.

He released his debut solo album, the John Cale-produced &quot;Crawl with Me&quot;, that year. He garnered a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1989, and James O&#x27;Mara and Kate Ryan were nominated for Best Music Video for Bergmann&#x27;s &quot;Our Little Secret&quot;.

1990&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Roulette&quot;, produced by Chris Wardman, became Bergmann&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough, spawning the rock radio hit &quot;Bound for Vegas&quot; and garnering him a deal with Polygram Records.

He followed up with a self-titled album on Polygram in 1991, again garnering significant radio airplay for the singles &quot;Faithlessly Yours&quot;, &quot;If She Could Sing&quot; and &quot;Message From Paul&quot;. Bergmann continued to tour extensively during this era. This included Big, Bad &amp; Groovy, a package tour of Canadian artists that included Bergmann, Sons of Freedom (band), Pure (Canadian band) and headliners Bootsauce.

In 1994 he collaborated with One Free Fall on a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Prisoners of Rock and Roll&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Borrowed Tunes&quot;, leading to a new deal with Sony Records for 1995&#x27;s &quot;What Fresh Hell Is This?&quot;. That album won the Juno Award for Best Alternative Rock Album at the Juno Awards of 1996, but the album was not a strong performer on the charts and he was then dropped from the label. Bergmann quit the music business for a period following his release by Sony, performing sporadically between 1995 and 1998.

The 1998 &quot;Design Flaw&quot;, produced by Peter J. Moore and released on the independent label Other People&#x27;s Music, was a reworking of tracks from his first three albums, plus a cover of Gram Parsons&#x27; &quot;Sin City&quot;. The songs featured Bergmann on acoustic guitar, with backing by Chris Spedding on electric. Bergmann then released &quot;Vultura Freeway&quot;, a compilation of unreleased demo recordings from the early 1980s, in 2000, with liner notes from Pointed Sticks front man Nick Jones.

Following &quot;Vultura Freeway&quot;, however, Bergmann withdrew from the music business for several years, due to health difficulties with degenerative arthritis.

In 2009 Bergmann&#x27;s bassist Ray Fulber compiled the CD &quot;Lost Art Bergmann&quot;, which featured early demo versions of most of the songs that appeared on the 1988 John Cale produced album. These demo recordings served as a tonic to many fans as they have a more guitar driven sound than the keyboard heavy Cale produced sessions.

On 26 August 2014, Bergmann released &quot;Songs for the Underclass&quot; on the independent label (weewerk).

On 13 May 2016, Bergmann released &quot;The Apostate&quot;, his first full-length album of new material since 1995, on weewerk Records.

On 12 May 2017, Bergmann released &quot;Remember Her Name&quot;, a remastered edition of his self-titled 1991 album.

On 30 December 2020, Bergmann was made a Member of the Order of Canada, for his &quot;indelible contributions to the Canadian punk music scene, and for his thought-provoking discourse on social, gender and racial inequalities.&quot;

On 21 May 2021, Bergmann released &quot;Late Stage Empire Dementia&quot; on (weewerk) Recordings. On 29 September 2023, he followed up with &quot;ShadowWalk: Legacy of Love&quot;, an album inspired by the death in 2022 of his wife Sherri Decembrini.

==Film appearances==
Art Bergmann has appeared in two Bruce McDonald films, &quot;Highway 61&quot; as Otto and &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; as himself, and as a musician in &quot;Conjurer of Monikers&quot;. Additionally, he was featured in &quot;Bloodied but Unbowed&quot;, a film featured at the 2010 Vancouver Documentary Film Festival.

<doc id="864375" wikidata="Q116219" url="?curid=864375" title="Alex Borstein">
<text>Alexandrea Borstein (born February 15, 1973) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and producer. She is best known for voicing Lois Griffin in the animated comedy series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (1999–present), for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award. She gained further acclaim for starring as Susie Myerson in the comedy-drama series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (2017–2023), which earned her two Primetime Emmy Awards.

Borstein also had lead roles as various characters on the sketch comedy series &quot;MADtv&quot; (1997–2009) and as Dawn Forchette in the medical comedy series &quot;Getting On&quot; (2013–2015). She had supporting roles in numerous films, including &quot;Showtime&quot; (2002), &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003), &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot; (2005), &quot;Little Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Killers&quot; (2010), &quot;Ted&quot; (2012), &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; (2014), &quot;Love the Coopers&quot; (2015), and &quot;Extinct&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Borstein was born in Highland Park, Illinois, a city north of Chicago. She was raised in Deerfield, Illinois, before her family moved to Northridge, California, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. She graduated from Chatsworth High School in 1989. She has two older brothers. Her parents, Irv and Judy Borstein, are both mental health professionals. She has stated that she is of Hungarian and Mongolian descent. She is Jewish.

Her father is from Atlanta. Her maternal grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, and immigrated to the United States after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Borstein is a graduate of San Francisco State University, where she studied rhetoric.

==Career==
===1993–1998: Career beginnings and &quot;MADtv&quot;===
Borstein trained in improvisational comedy at the ACME Comedy Theater, near Hollywood, where she met her writing partner and future husband Jackson Douglas. Shortly after they began working together on the animated series &quot;The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper&quot; and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, Borstein left her position at an ad agency – where she had written print ads for Barbie – to become a full-time writer. In 1996, while still writing for &quot;Casper&quot;, Borstein worked on the show &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; as the voice of Queen Machina, the queen of the Machine Empire.

In 1997, Borstein became a cast member on the third season of the sketch comedy show &quot;MADtv&quot; after being scouted by talent agents. She originally joined the cast as a featured player, but was upgraded to the repertory mid-season.

Borstein was best known on &quot;MADtv&quot; for her character Ms. Swan (owner of the &quot;Gorgeous Pretty Beauty Nail Salon&quot;); her other recurring characters included Eracist Anne, &quot;Stick Chick&quot; Echo, singer Jasmine Wayne-Wayne, child prodigy Karen Goddard, lounge singer Shaunda, &quot;News at Six&quot; outside-the-studio reporter Sue Napersville, and Cordo the GAP troll. When Seth Green made recurring appearances on the show as mean boss Mr. Brightling, Borstein would play his mother, Mama Brightling.

===1999–2009: Further success and &quot;Family Guy&quot;===

While working on &quot;MADtv&quot;, Borstein met Seth MacFarlane, who was then preparing to launch the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; on Fox. MacFarlane was originally supposed to create animated shorts for &quot;MADtv&quot;, but declined in favor of creating an independent series. MacFarlane cast Borstein as the voice of character Lois Griffin. After the show&#x27;s debut in January 1999, &quot;Family Guy&quot; was cancelled by the network twice in 2000 and 2002, but eventually returned in 2005. As well as her role as the voice performer for Lois and several other characters (including a brief appearance as Ms. Swan in a 2005 episode), she is also a producer and staff writer. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode &quot;Lois Comes Out of Her Shell&quot; in 2013.

In 2000, Borstein was cast as Sookie St. James in the WB drama &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She portrayed Sookie in the pilot but her &quot;MADtv&quot; contract prevented her from continuing in the role. Borstein made recurring appearances on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; throughout the show&#x27;s run, first as the harpist Drella and later as the stylist Miss Celine.

As a film actor, she played Ms. Ungermeyer the school principal in &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; (2003), the best friend of Halle Berry&#x27;s character in &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004), and an employee at CBS News in &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005). She also had a small role in the movie &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003) and an uncredited cameo as an obnoxious coffee shop patron in the Will Ferrell movie &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot; (2005). On some commercials, she sometimes voices Olive Oyl from Popeye and Betty Boop.

Borstein was a co-host of GSN&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Blackjack&quot; in 2004. She made at least three guest appearances, once as Lois Griffin, on the Comedy Central animated program &quot;Drawn Together&quot;.

Borstein was cast as a press secretary in the 2007 sitcom pilot &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, but the series was not picked up for broadcast. She was seen in the 2009 comedy &quot;For Christ&#x27;s Sake&quot;, which was directed by her then husband Jackson Douglas. 

Borstein&#x27;s production company is called Crackerpants, Inc. In 2007, it released the DVD &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous (in a Down-to-Earth Bombshell Sort of Way)&quot;, a recording of a live performance at the Alex Theatre with Teddy Towne as the opening act. The title comes from one of many female character breakdowns Borstein reads from to illustrate sexism in the industry.

===2010–present: &quot;Getting On&quot; and &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;===

Borstein has made several supporting appearances in such comedic films as &quot;Killers&quot; (2010), &quot;Dinner for Schmucks&quot; (2010), &quot;Ted&quot; (2012), &quot;ParaNorman&quot; (2012), &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Angry Birds Movie&quot; (2016).

In 2010, Borstein joined the first season staff of the Showtime comedy-drama series &quot;Shameless&quot;, as a writer and supervising producer. In its second season, she held the position of writer and consulting producer. She also guest-starred as Lou Deckner in numerous episodes of the series, beginning in the first-season episode &quot;But at Last Came a Knock.&quot;

She also appeared as a comedian contestant on IFC&#x27;s short-lived comedy-driven game show &quot;Bunk&quot; in 2012.

Borstein starred as Dawn Forchette on the HBO comedy series &quot;Getting On&quot;, which is a remake of a UK series with the same name. The series has gained positive reviews and earned multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It aired from 2013 to 2015.

From 2017 to 2023, Borstein starred as Susie Myerson in the Amazon Prime Video historical comedy-drama series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, for which she received significant critical acclaim and won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Personal life==
Borstein met actor and writer Jackson Douglas while she was studying improv at the ACME Comedy Theatre. Douglas proposed to her during the taping of a &quot;MADtv&quot; sketch and they were married in 1999. Douglas filed for divorce in October 2014 and it was finalized in 2017.

Borstein was pregnant while she recorded the DVD commentary for the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Stewie Kills Lois&quot;; she joked about naming her baby Stewie. She and Douglas have a son and a daughter.

Borstein, who is a carrier of hemophilia herself, is a longtime advocate for the National Hemophilia Foundation.

=== Religious beliefs ===
According to Borstein, &quot;We do Shabbat every Friday night. I&#x27;m not [someone] that goes to temple all the time—I&#x27;m a High Holidays temple goer, and that&#x27;s about it. But there are traditions,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;Having a mother and a grandmother who are Holocaust survivors, I feel a large responsibility to continue that culture and those traditions—not necessarily the dogma, but what it feels like to be Jewish. I want to instill that in my kids.&quot;

<doc id="864378" wikidata="Q169998" url="?curid=864378" title="Cape Nordkinn">
<text>Cape Nordkinn ( or ) at is the northernmost point on the Nordkinn Peninsula in county, Norway. It is notable for being the northernmost point of mainland Norway, and by extension the northernmost point of mainland Europe. The cape is located on the border of Gamvik Municipality and Lebesby Municipality.

==Geography==
Cape Nordkinn is the northern tip of the fractal peninsula within the northernmost part of the Nordkinn Peninsula, about in a straight line northwest from the village of Mehamn.

The famous North Cape ( or more precisely ) at , is about further north than Cape Nordkinn, and it is branded as Europe&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; northernmost point, although it is on an island that is just offshore of the mainland.

==Tourism==
In sharp contrast to North Cape with its extensive tourist infrastructure and busloads of visitors, Cape Nordkinn is a lonely but impressive place that can only be visited following at least a full-day hike from Mehamn and one day back. The terrain is sufficiently difficult for hiking, consisting largely of several kilometers long rock fields, that it is advisable to prepare for more than two days for the round trip, since it is one way. There is no actual trail, only erected poles and cairns at rather long distances apart.

It is advisable not to travel in rainy weather, as the slippery stones make the terrain very difficult, with sudden fogs and associated whiteout. In fog the orientation on the highland south of the cape can be impossible without a GPS. There is mobile phone coverage in the area, except on west facing slopes.

The cape can also be reached by boat tours. The tourist bureau of Gamvik Municipality provides tourist information. Hurtigruten ships call at Mehamn and Kjøllefjord to the southwest of the cape, providing a sighting opportunity for visitors on the way.

<text>Gahan Allen Wilson (February 18, 1930 – November 21, 2019) was an American author, cartoonist and illustrator known for his cartoons depicting horror-fantasy situations.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in Evanston, Illinois, and was inspired by the work of the satiric &quot;Mad&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot; cartoonists, and 1950s science fiction films. His cartoons and prose fiction appeared regularly in &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for nearly 50 years. He was a regular contributor to the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; humor magazine. He published cartoons and film reviews for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. From 1992 through end of publication, he prepared all the front covers for the annual book &quot;Passport to World Band Radio&quot;. Wilson was a movie review columnist for &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; and a book critic for &quot;Realms of Fantasy&quot; magazine.

Wilson wrote and illustrated a short story for Harlan Ellison&#x27;s anthology &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot; (1972). He also contributed short stories to other publications; including &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;The Zombie Butler&quot; both of which appeared in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; and were reprinted in &quot;Gahan Wilson&#x27;s Cracked Cosmos&quot; (1975).
In 1975 he designed a small trophy, a bust of H. P. Lovecraft, to be given to winners of the World Fantasy Award; the bust was retired following the 2015 awards amid complaints about Lovecraft&#x27;s history of racism. A new statuette designed by Vincent Villafranca depicting a tree in front of a full moon was released in 2017.

Wilson created a computer game, &quot;Gahan Wilson&#x27;s The Ultimate Haunted House&quot;, with Byron Preiss. He wrote the 1992 animated short &quot;Diner&quot;.

In 2009, Fantagraphics Books released &quot;Gahan Wilson: 50 Years of Playboy Cartoons&quot;, a slipcased, three-volume collection of Wilson&#x27;s cartoons and short stories for that magazine. A collection of his work, &quot;Fifty Years of Gahan Wilson&quot;, was published in 2010.

==Awards==
In 2005, Wilson was recognized with a lifetime achievement award from the World Fantasy Awards. He received the World Fantasy Convention Award (in the form of the bust of H. P. Lovecraft that he had designed as the award trophy in 1975) in 1981. He also received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005.

Wilson is the subject of a feature-length documentary film, &quot;Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird&quot;, directed by Steven-Charles Jaffe.

He was an influence on later alternative cartoonists, including Gary Larson, John Callahan and Bill Plympton.

==Personal life==
Wilson was married to author Nancy Winters (née Nancy Dee Midyette) from 1966 until her death in March 2019.

In 2019, Wilson&#x27;s stepson Paul Winters announced that Wilson was suffering from advanced dementia. Wilson died from complications of dementia on November 21, 2019, in Scottsdale, Arizona.

<text>Johann Georg Palitzsch (11 June 1723 in [modern Dresden], Electorate of Saxony, Holy Roman Empire) – 21 February 1788 in Prohlis) was a German astronomer who became famous for recovering Comet 1P/Halley (better known as Halley&#x27;s Comet) on Christmas Day, 1758. The periodic nature of this comet had been deduced by its namesake Edmond Halley in 1705, but Halley had died before seeing if his prediction would come true.
Raised to become a successful farmer under a strict stepfather, Palitzsch secretly studied as much astronomy as he could from the books he could afford. He learned contemporary astronomy from the book “Vorhof der Sternwissenschaft” (“The Forecourt of Astronomy”) by Christian Pescheck. He learned Latin and, at age 21, inherited the farm, which allowed him to construct his own botanical garden, library, laboratory, and museum.
He received support from various benefactors, including the future King. But the wars between Prussia and Austria interrupted his ambitions.

==Observation of Halley&#x27;s comet==
In his 1705 book &quot;Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets&quot;, Edmond Halley had calculated that a comet seen in 1682 was the same one seen in 1607 and 1531, which was orbiting the Sun due to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, and that it would therefore return in 1758. Both Halley and Newton had since died. Palitzsch kept a regular watch for the predicted comet and was able to see a new light in the sky in the appropriate position on December 25, 1758. He reported his finding to , who confirmed a new light in the sky on December 28 and sent in a short report to the &quot;Dresdner Anzeiger&quot;, without realizing (as Palitzsch did) that this was a crucial confirmation of the mechanical laws of physics.

Seeing Palitzsch&#x27;s and Hoffman&#x27;s report, Gottfried Heinsius published on January 18, 1759, that this confirmed Halley&#x27;s prediction and that it was thereby proven that the comet was a celestial body in regular motion, not a portent of dire fortune. Although Palitzsch had been the first to understand this, Heinsius was the first to announce it in print. Meanwhile, Charles Messier independently discovered the comet in Paris, announcing it on April 1. When it was much later realized the farmer Palitzsch had been the first to look for and find the comet, he received much admiration from Messier and the scientific community. 

Independent confirmations of the comet were later received from Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux in Pondicherry, Dirk Klinkenberg in Haarlem, Maximilian Hell in Vienna, Étienne-Hyacinthe de Ratte in Montpellier, in Leiden, and Jean Baptiste François de Lanux in Réunion among others. Another independent discovery was made by the black astronomer Francis Williams in Jamaica, but European scientists were never made aware of this.

==Legacy==

Upon his death on 21 February 1788 Palitzsch left behind a library of 3518 books, partly consisting of handwritten copies he had created from scientific works too expensive for him to purchase.

His house was destroyed in the 1813 Battle of Dresden, but a nearby farmhouse has been converted into a museum, which contains a mockup of his estate, a model of the town of Prohlis, excavations from the area, and reproductions of his scientific publications.

A crater and a &quot;vallis&quot; (valley) on the Moon are named after him.

The asteroid 11970 Palitzsch also is named after him.

<text>Thomas Henry Kuchel ( ; August 15, 1910 – November 21, 1994) was an American politician. A moderate Republican, he served as a US Senator from California from 1953 to 1969 and was the minority whip in the Senate, where he was the co-manager on the floor for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Kuchel voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court, while Kuchel did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1968.

==Early life==
Kuchel was born in Anaheim, Orange County, the son of Henry Kuchel, a newspaper editor and the former Letitia Bailey. Kuchel attended public school as a child. While he was at Anaheim High School, he was student body president, a yell leader and a member of the debate team. While there, he debated a team from Whittier High School, winning his own debate against his opponent and later intraparty rival, Richard Nixon.

Kuchel graduated from both the University of Southern California in 1932, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the University of Southern California Law School before he entered the state government.

==Career==
Kuchel served in the California State Assembly from 1937 to 1941, in the California State Senate from 1941 to 1945, and as California State Controller from 1946 to 1953. During World War II, Kuchel was a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve.

In 1953, Kuchel was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Earl Warren to fill the vacancy created after Republican Senator Richard Nixon was elected Vice President. Kuchel was elected to the remainder of Nixon&#x27;s term in 1954 and to full terms in 1956 and 1962.

As a U.S. Senator, Kuchel had first attempted to steer clear of the factional infighting within the California Republican Party, which took place in the 1950s between Vice President Nixon, U.S. Senate Republican Leader William F. Knowland, a conservative, and Republican Governor Goodwin J. Knight, a liberal. Known as a moderate, Kuchel eventually backed Knowland in his campaign to oust Knight in the Republican primary for governor in 1958. Knight withdrew his re-election bid and ran for Knowland&#x27;s Senate seat, but he and Knowland both lost that year.

While running for a second full term in 1962, Kuchel pointedly refused to endorse ticket-mate Nixon&#x27;s candidacy for governor in a heated race against incumbent Democrat Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown Sr. The 1962 election favored incumbents, as Brown beat Nixon by a comfortable margin and Kuchel coasted to victory. To date, Kuchel is the last senatorial candidate to win all 58 California counties in a single election.

However, Kuchel broke with Knowland in 1964 when the latter asked him to endorse Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president, and Kuchel instead endorsed Nelson Rockefeller, who narrowly lost the California presidential primary to Goldwater. During his campaign for Rockefeller, Kuchel warned in campaign ads that control by the right-wing movement of the California Republican party would lead to the destruction of the two-party system.

While Kuchel was campaigning against Goldwater, a &quot;vicious document&quot; circulated that purported to be an affidavit signed by a Los Angeles police officer, saying that in 1949, he had arrested Kuchel. The document said that the arrest was for drunkenness while Kuchel had been in the midst of a sex act with a man. Four men were indicted for the libel: Norman H. Krause, a bar owner and ex-Los Angeles policeman, who had actually arrested two people in 1950 who worked in Kuchel&#x27;s office for drunkenness; Jack D. Clemmons, a Los Angeles police sergeant until his resignation two weeks before his arrest; John F. Fergus, a public relations man for Eversharp, who was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and given a suspended sentence in 1947; and Francis A. Capell of Zarephath, New Jersey, the publisher of a right-wing newsletter.

During the 1966 California gubernatorial primary, Kuchel was urged by moderates to run against conservative actor Ronald Reagan. Citing the hostilities of the growing conservative movement, Kuchel decided not to run. He instead issued a negative statement about the conservatives: &quot;A fanatical neo-fascist political cult of right-wingers in the GOP, driven by a strange mixture of corrosive hatred and sickening fear that is recklessly determined to control our party or destroy it!&quot; In May 1963, Kuchel attacked the right-wing movement in the Senate in a speech, describing them as not conservatives, but &quot;radicals with a capital R&quot; and that the movement defiled conservatism.

Kuchel was one of thirteen Republican senators to vote in favor of Medicare. In 1981, he described himself as a progressive Republican, a type of Republican that governs for the many.

Kuchel was narrowly defeated in the Republican primary in 1968 by conservative state Superintendent of Public Instruction Max Rafferty, who went on to lose the general election to Alan Cranston, the former State Controller, a position that had once been held by Kuchel himself. Kuchel returned to California and moved to Beverly Hills, where he practiced law until his retirement in 1981.

He was appointed by the Supreme Court to represent the appellee in &quot;United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film.&quot;

==Death==
He died of lung cancer on November 21, 1994, in Beverly Hills.

==Legacy==
Secretary of Defense and former White House Chief of Staff and CIA Director Leon Panetta began in politics as a legislative assistant to Kuchel. Panetta would cite Kuchel as &quot;a tremendous role model.&quot;

On August 17, 2010, the Beverly Hills City Council paid tribute to Senator Kuchel on the 100th anniversary of his birth. His widow Betty Kuchel and daughter Karen Kuchel accepted a proclamation from then Councilman and now mayor William Warren Brien, a grandson of Governor Earl Warren, at the council meeting.

<text>Launceston Airport is a regional airport on the outskirts of Launceston, Tasmania. The airport is located in the industrial area of Western Junction, 15 kilometres from Launceston city centre. It is Tasmania&#x27;s second busiest after Hobart.

In the 2023/24 financial year, the airport recorded 1.4 million passenger movements. It is Australia&#x27;s 13th busiest airport.
==History==

After the formation of the Tasmanian Aero Club in 1927, the first air travel facility in Tasmania was built on the site. In July 1929 the Home Territories Department acquired land at the Western Junction, then also called Valley of Springs, for a £20,400 ($41,000) aerodrome. The Western Junction Aerodrome was officially opened in 1929, and opened for use in 1930. In February 1931, around 20,000 people crammed into Evandale Road to watch Colonel Brinsmead, Controller of Civil Aviation, officially open Western Junction as a government aerodrome. During 1932, small aircraft flew from Launceston to Flinders Island.

From August 1940 until late 1944, the airport was used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as a base for No. 7 Elementary Flying Training School. It was Tasmania&#x27;s only RAAF Base. Two of the Bellman hangars from this period are still located at the airport, on the southern Freight and General Aviation operations area.

In 1962, under the leadership of Tony John, a plan for major redevelopment of the airport was approved. This included strengthening of all pavements, a runway extension, and a new two storey terminal building built by Hansen Yuncken. The airport was officially reopened that same year as Launceston Airport. In October 1982 the runway was further upgraded to accommodate Boeing 767s. 

In 1998, the airport was privatised, and is now owned jointly by Launceston City Council and Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. The collapse of Ansett Australia in 2001, the introduction of Virgin Blue and Jetstar in 2001 and 2004; and the creation of the Australian low-cost airline market; have all contributed to a dramatic increase in aircraft movements at Launceston Airport. Tiger Airways Australia also introduced services, and withdrew again in July 2010 as did Bonza Airlines in 2024.

==Terminal==

In 2009 a A$20m expansion program commenced that included two new gate lounges and two new baggage carousels and a 1000m² expansion of the main landside passenger lounge, with views of the apron and runway. The redeveloped terminal was officially opened on 12 March 2010 by the Premier of Tasmania, David Bartlett.

In 2022 Launceston Airport commenced a A$100m redevelopment, the largest expansion in its history. The project includes expansion of the Check-in Hall, security area, new food and beverage outlets, expansion of the Launceston Store and a larger Arrivals Hall to be rolled out within five years.

The airport currently has a bar; Ben&#x27;s Bar; two café outlets; Arthur&#x27;s Cafe and Stack&#x27;s Spot; a temporary cafe in Arrivals, The Barrow and The Launceston Store which sells both convenience items and stocks the very best of Tasmanian artisan produce, wine, spirits, art, craft and gifts. 

In August 2023, the new check-in hall opened, commencing the first stage of the airport&#x27;s infrastructure development to improve the passenger experience.

Supported by the State and Federal governments, the project doubled the size of the airport’s check-in hall, with an additional 650 square metres offering space for self-check-in equipment and an easier security experience.

The 13th of December 2023 marked the completion of the first phase in the terminal expansion, with new state-of-the-art security screening technology becoming available for airport visitors. 

==Airlines and destinations==
The Qantas Group is the dominant operator at Launceston airport, with Jetstar operating up to six daily flights to/from Melbourne, up to two daily flights to/from Sydney and up to one daily flight to/from Brisbane throughout the year. QantasLink operates up to four flights daily to/from Melbourne, up to two daily flights to/from Sydney and seasonal services to/from Brisbane. Virgin Australia operates up to four daily flights to/from Melbourne, one daily flight to/from Sydney, between four and seven flights per week to/from Brisbane as well as a number of seasonal flights to/from Adelaide and Perth.

Sharp Airlines offer up to three flights a day to Flinders Island and up to two flights a day to King Island via Burnie.

Airlines of Tasmania provide twice weekly services to both Cape Barren Island and Hobart, in addition to light aircraft charter.

Bonza commenced flights to and from the Gold Coast in November 2023, with flights departing regularly all year round. Flights to and from the Sunshine Coast commenced in March 2024, before the airline ceased a month later.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 29 May 2003, Qantas Flight 1737 en route from Melbourne Airport was involved in an attempted hijacking shortly after takeoff. The would-be hijacker, a passenger named David Robinson, intended to fly the aircraft into the Walls of Jerusalem National Park located in central Tasmania. The flight attendants and passengers successfully subdued and restrained Robinson, and the aircraft returned to Melbourne, where it landed safely.

<text>Lotte World or Lotte World Adventure () is a major recreation complex in Seoul, South Korea. It consists of a large indoor theme park, an outdoor amusement park called &quot;Magic Island&quot;, an artificial island on a lake linked by monorail, shopping malls, a luxury hotel, an observation tower, a Korean folk museum, sports facilities, and movie theaters. Opened in July 1989, Lotte World receives approximately 7.3 million visitors each year. Lotte World&#x27;s sister theme park, Lotte World Adventure Busan, opened in March 2022.

<text>The Cap de Creus (Cabo de Creus in Spanish) is a peninsula and a headland located at the far northeast of Catalonia, some south from the French border. The cape lies in the municipal area of Cadaqués, and the nearest large town is Figueres, the capital of the Alt Empordà and the birthplace of Salvador Dalí. Cap de Creus is the easternmost point of Catalonia and therefore of mainland Spain and the Iberian Peninsula.

The area is now a Natural Park.

The peninsula has an area of of an extraordinary landscape value; a wind-beaten very rocky dry region, with almost no trees, in contrast with a seaside rich in minuscule creeks of deep blue sea to anchor. Mountains are the eastern foothills of the Pyrenees, the natural border between France and Spain. The region is frequently swept by the awful north wind &quot;tramontana&quot; (beyond mountains) which has caused many naval disasters. Cadaqués is the most well known village, home of artists and writers, with sophisticated atmosphere, near Port Lligat where Dalí built his home in a paradise small bay. (Dalí depicted the peninsula in his paintings &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; and &quot;The Great Masturbator&quot;.) El Port de la Selva, with a little fishing harbour, is less exploited, with good gastronomic resources and pleasant terraces.

Sant Pere de Rodes stands out at of altitude, with views of the Cap and the Pyrenees. It is an 11th-century monastery whose first structures date from about 750 AD.

One legend tells that the &quot;Cap de Creus&quot; was hewn by Hercules.

== Geology ==

The Cap de Creus offers many geological exposures of exceptional interest, especially for the study of Variscan intrusions and shear zones. It is rated as &quot;a worldwide reference place for structural geology&quot;.

<text>Punta da Estaca de Bares is the northernmost point of Spain and the Iberian Peninsula, at a latitude of 43° 47′ 38″ North. It is located in Galicia. Conventionally, it marks the western end of the Cantabrian Sea, or Bay of Biscay, in the North Atlantic ocean.

The peninsula of Estaca de Bares penetrates considerably into the Atlantic Ocean and the Cantabrian Sea, and as a result it is one of the rainiest places in Europe, with more than 2500 mm a year (a Temperate rain forest). 
These special weather conditions have created over the centuries a unique ecosystem and biodiversity which have made it possible for this area to be declared an Area of National Natural Interest.

The history of Estaca de Bares Point is very rich. The ruins of the Phoenician Salt Fish Factory and the Phoenician Port are open to visitors. There is a lighthouse that was constructed in 1850 and still works to this day, under the administration of the Captain of the Port of Ferrol, Spain. There is also a bird sanctuary, ruins of molinas (grain mills) and abandoned military bases located here.

There is currently an abandoned military site there. It was first operated by the US Coast Guard beginning in the early 1960s as a LORAN (Long Range Aid to Navigation) Station. The station at Estaca de Bares operated jointly with stations operated by the British Government in East Blockhouse, Wales and, until 1973, the French Government in Pospoder, France. In 1978, after the Coast Guard ended the LORAN operations, the US Air Force assumed control of the base. The US Air Force 2186 Communications Squadron, headquartered at Torrejón Air Base near Madrid, operated the site as a remote Radio Relay Link (RRL) communications site until 1991, and it now sits in ruins. While the site was open, many Americans met and married local citizens.

There are also a series of waterways that used to power mills for the local citizens. These mills are located between the abandoned military base and the bird sanctuary.

The other site used to be an old signaling station used by the Spanish Navy. It has been converted into a hotel/restaurant.

During World War II a German submarine was sunk off the coast there. One of the German officers who survived the sinking returned every year thereafter to mark the anniversary. After his death he had his ashes scattered over Estaca de Bares.

<doc id="864407" wikidata="Q9094297" url="?curid=864407" title="Violet Carson">
<text>Violet Helen Carson (1 September 1898 – 26 December 1983) was a British actress of radio, stage and television, and a singer and pianist, who had a long and celebrated career as an actress and performer during the early days of BBC Radio, and during the last two decades of her life as the matronly Christian widow, town gossip and elderly battle-axe Ena Sharples in the ITV television soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. She was one of the original characters from the series debut in 1960 and would feature in the role for twenty years.

== Early life and career ==
Carson was born on German Street in Ancoats, Lancashire. Her Scottish father, William Brown Carson, ran a flour mill and her mother, Mary Clarke Carson (&quot;&quot; Tordoff), was an amateur singer. As a child, she took piano lessons while attending a Church of England school and performed with her younger sister Nellie as a singing act called the Carson Sisters. In 1913, she became a cinema pianist providing the musical accompaniment for silent films. As silent films fell out of fashion following the arrival of &quot;talkies&quot;, Carson took up singing.

She married road contractor George Peploe on 1 September 1926, her 28th birthday. Peploe died in 1929 at the age of 31. They had no children and Carson never remarried.

==Radio and theatre career==
In 1935, Carson joined BBC Radio in Manchester, singing a range of material from comic musical hall style songs to light operatic arias. She began in a show called &quot;Songs at the Piano&quot; and was a regular member of &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; on the BBC Home Service. Carson was also the star of &quot;Nursery Sing Song&quot; from Manchester, in which she frequently sang with producer Trevor Hill, many years her junior. Contrary to popular opinion, she was never known as &quot;Auntie Vi&quot;, that epithet belonging only to Violet Fraser in the 1920s. &quot;I was never anyone&#x27;s aunt,&quot; Carson exclaimed when Hill produced a BBC Radio programme about her in 1981. 

In 1938, Carson provided piano accompaniment for two songs in an Al Bowlly recording session, which were released on a His Master&#x27;s Voice 78 with Carson being credited. She worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts during the Second World War, and was for six years the pianist for the Wilfred Pickles radio show &quot;Have A Go&quot;.

Her extensive radio career included a period as a presenter and interviewer on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; for five years, and she acted in numerous radio dramas. It was while recording a children&#x27;s programme in 1951 that she first worked with Tony Warren, who would later become the creator of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

== &quot;Coronation Street&quot; ==

Carson is best remembered for her role as Ena Sharples, the flint-faced and gruff moral voice of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role she played from 1960 to 1980. In 1962, she was named ITV Personality of the Year for her portrayal of Ena. 

For much of her time on the programme, Ena&#x27;s moralising caused her to spar regularly with Elsie Tanner (Patricia Phoenix). She appeared in the first episode, which aired on 9 December 1960. Long after her departure from the programme and after her own death, Carson continues to be synonymous with the hairnet that Ena chose to wear for almost every occasion. As a singer, Carson was in the soprano range and was a regular on the Christian hymnal programme &quot;Stars on Sunday&quot; during its ten-year run from 1969.

On 14 February 1968, Carson sailed from Southampton on the Orient Line&#x27;s liner &quot;Oriana&quot;, bound for Australia. She arrived in Fremantle on 6 March 1968 and Melbourne on 9 March. Thousands of Australians greeted her on the docks. On 22 March 1968, she attended the 10th Annual &quot;TV Week Logie Awards&quot; (named after John Logie Baird) at the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne, where she presented awards to some of the winners that year.

During the 1970s, Carson suffered from ill health, and only played Ena sporadically from 1972 onwards. She was absent from &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for most of 1974 after suffering a stroke.

In April 1980, Carson made what would ultimately be her final appearance on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. A storyline involving Ena moving to Lytham St. Annes to stay with a friend while her flat at the street&#x27;s community centre was being renovated, was aired. When the character returned, the flat was not ready and Ena announced on screen (to characters Ken Barlow and Albert Tatlock) that she would return to her flat — but only if she felt like doing so. It was at this point that Carson became ill with pernicious anaemia and was forced to leave the programme, although at the time it was anticipated that she would return at some stage. However, this did not happen and all subsequent storylines involving Ena were shelved due to Carson&#x27;s poor health, although Ena was not written out.

Carson lived in a bungalow in Bispham, Blackpool, with her sister Nellie, and refused to make any public appearances after her retirement. The year after she retired, Carson underwent surgery for an abscess from which she never fully recovered.

==Recordings==
Violet Carson released an EP &quot;Violet Carson Sings and Plays for You&quot; on the Columbia label in 1961. She later recorded an album &quot;Stars on Sunday: Miss Violet Carson&quot; for the York label.

==Death ==
Carson died of heart failure on Boxing Day 1983 at the age of 85. She was cremated in a private ceremony at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool, on 4 January 1984, and is commemorated at Bispham Parish Church in Blackpool.

A memorial service dedicated to Carson was held at Manchester Cathedral on 28 February 1984, the same Cathedral where she was baptised and married. The service was attended by 500 people, as well as many of her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; colleagues including William Roache (Ken Barlow) and Granada Television president Lord Bernstein. Sir Charles Groves conducted the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, including an arrangement of Carson&#x27;s favourite song, &quot;Cherry Ripe&quot;.

Carson left £193,190 in her will, with bequests including to the Grand Theatre Trust in Blackpool, the Sharp Street Ragged School in Manchester, for whom she was the former president, and Friends of Manchester Cathedral. The residue of her estate went to her sister, Nellie Kelly.

==Honours ==
Carson was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and had a rose cultivar named after her (&#x27;Violet Carson&#x27;, McGredy 1964). Wax statues of her are held at Madame Tussauds in London and Blackpool. She switched on the Blackpool Illuminations in 1961.

Carson is commemorated by a blue plaque outside Granada Studios in Manchester, where she filmed the majority of her work as Ena Sharples.

<doc id="864411" wikidata="Q2278283" url="?curid=864411" title="Sheridan Downey">
<text>Sheridan Downey (March 11, 1884 – October 25, 1961) was an American lawyer and a Democratic politician from Wyoming and California. In 1934, he ran for lieutenant governor of California as Upton Sinclair&#x27;s running mate in the &quot;End Poverty in California&quot; campaign. In 1938 he was elected U.S. Senator from California, and he served from 1939 to 1950.

==Early life==
He was born in Laramie, the seat of Albany County in southeastern Wyoming, the son of the former Evangeline Victoria Owen and Stephen Wheeler Downey. He was educated in public schools of Laramie, and attended the University of Wyoming. Downey attended the University of Michigan Law School, and attained admission to the bar in 1907. In 1914, the school awarded Downey his LL.B. degree as a member of the class of 1907. He practiced law in Laramie, and in 1908 he was elected prosecuting attorney of Albany County as a Republican. In 1910 he married Helen Symons; they had five children. In 1912, Downey split Wyoming&#x27;s Republican vote by heading the state&#x27;s &quot;Bull Moose&quot; revolt in support of Theodore Roosevelt, thus leading to a Democratic victory statewide.

==Politics==
In 1913, Downey moved to Sacramento, California, and continued to practice law with his brother, Stephen Wheeler Downey, Jr. During his first few years in California, he devoted most of his time and energy to his law practice and various real estate interests. In 1924 he supported Robert La Follette, Sr.&#x27;s Progressive party campaign for the presidency, and in 1932 he became a Democrat and campaigned for the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In October 1933, Downey announced that he was running for governor of California. After a series of meetings with the writer Upton Sinclair, who also had designs on the governorship, Downey agreed to run for lieutenant governor of California while Sinclair ran for governor. Their political platform was the End Poverty in California (EPIC) plan. Opponents called the ticket &quot;Uppie and Downey&quot;. EPIC began as a mass movement, calling for an economic revolution to lift California out of the depression. The EPIC platform called for state support for the creation of jobs, a massive program of public works, and an extensive system of state-sponsored pensions and radical changes in the tax structure.
Before long, more than 2,000 grassroots EPIC clubs sprouted throughout the state, and the most popular EPIC anthem, &quot;Campaign Chorus for Downey and Sinclair,&quot; was made into a phonograph record by Titan Records for mass distribution. It featured the speaking voice of Downey, announcer Jerry Wilford, and the singing of three men calling themselves the &quot;Epic Trio.&quot; While EPIC was defeated by Republican Frank Merriam in November 1934. Downey, who had been subjected to less vitriol than Sinclair during the campaign, remained a viable political force in the state. Downey actually garnered 123,000 votes more than his running mate. Downey gained a statewide reputation as a champion of progressive politics.

After Sinclair&#x27;s defeat, Downey became an attorney involved with Dr. Francis Townsend, the main advocate of the Townsend Plan for government old-age pensions. Townsend&#x27;s $200-a-month pension plan had won a large following in California, particularly among retirees. Downey&#x27;s support lead to him writing &quot;Why I Believe in the Townsend Plan (1936).&quot; In 1936, the two drifted apart, as Townsend supported Union Party presidential nominee William Lemke of North Dakota, and Downey remained a Democrat committed to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

In 1936, Christensen ran for Congress against incumbent Democrat Frank H. Buck, but was defeated in the primary 60% to 40%.

==U.S. Senate==

In 1938 Downey was elected to the United States Senate where he served until his resignation in November 1950. He ran as a supporter of the proposed &quot;Ham and Eggs&quot; government pension program and defeated incumbent Senator William Gibbs McAdoo in the Democratic primary by more than 135,000 votes. Despite the strong backing McAdoo received from the White House and a personal campaign appearance by President Franklin Roosevelt to endorse McAdoo, Downey won the primary and went on to win the general election, defeating Republican Philip Bancroft 54%-46%. On October 24, 1938, Downey appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Though he had been considered a staunch liberal, Downey as a senator became a conservative Democrat who won the support of California&#x27;s major oil interests. He supported the efforts of oil companies and agribusiness to procure state, rather than federal, control of California&#x27;s oil resources. He also worked to exempt the California Central Valley from the Reclamation Act of 1902 to assist corporate farms. In the Senate, Downey also introduced a series of pension bills, and in 1941, he was named chairman of a special Senate committee on old-age insurance.

He took an early stand supporting a military draft but opposed the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s plans to requisition industries in time of war. During World War II, he called for the creation of a committee to investigate the status of blacks and other minorities in the armed forces and advocated a postwar United Nations, international control of atomic energy, increased veterans&#x27; benefits, and federal pay raises. At the end of the war, he opposed continuation of the military draft.

During his years in the Senate, Downey often represented the interests of California&#x27;s powerful motion picture industry. His shift from a liberal New Dealer to a conservative Democrat would become officially recognized after the war ended.

==Re-election==

After his narrow reelection to the Senate in 1944, defeating Republican lieutenant governor Frederick F. Houser by 52 percent to 48 percent, Downey began a push for the California Central Valley project, which had been initiated during the 1930s as part of the New Deal&#x27;s vast array of public works projects, such as power dams and irrigation canals.

In a 1947 book entitled &quot;They Would Rule the Valley&quot;, Downey argued that the farmers of the Central Valley, who controlled water rights based on state law, would come into conflict with the federal Bureau of Reclamation. Downey acknowledged that Central Valley farmers were technically in violation of the Reclamation Act of 1902, but defended these violations of Federal law as necessary because, in the context of California agriculture the Federal limitation was impractical. Downey&#x27;s political views made him vulnerable. Helen Gahagan Douglas challenged him in a primary. In 1950 Downey dropped out of the race, citing ill health, and threw his support in the Democratic primary behind Manchester Boddy, the conservative and wealthy publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;. He even indicated that if Douglas won the primary, which she did, he would support Republican U.S. Representative Richard Nixon in the general election. In the ensuing Douglas-Nixon race, Nixon prevailed in what his critics called a smear campaign. From this race, Nixon emerged with the sobriquet &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;. Downey resigned from his Senate seat on November 30, 1950, enabling the governor to appoint Nixon, which gave him a seniority advantage over other new senators elected in 1950.

==Later life and achievements==
After he left the Senate, Downey practiced law in Washington, D.C., until his death in San Francisco in 1961. Downey also served as a lobbyist representing the city of Long Beach and the large petroleum concerns leasing its extensive waterfront. Upon his passing, he donated his body to the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. His papers are archived at the Bancroft Library in Berkeley.

During his years in the Senate, Downey was often described as slight, grayish, and strikingly handsome. His political career in many ways typified the transformation of millions of Republican progressives who supported Theodore Roosevelt and the &quot;Bull Moose&quot; movement of 1912 into Democratic supporters of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 1930s. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Downey was one of California&#x27;s most significant progressive politicians. While he was often overshadowed in state politics by Republican progressives like Hiram Johnson and Earl Warren, Downey left a significant mark because of his tireless advocacy of old-age pensions, organized labor, and racial justice. His conservative turn after his reelection in 1944, when he increasingly represented the interests of big business, large agribusiness concerns, and the oil industry, has obscured his historical reputation as a one-time liberal and progressive force in California politics.

<text>In the mathematical field of geometric topology, a Heegaard splitting () is a decomposition of a compact oriented 3-manifold that results from dividing it into two handlebodies.

==Definitions==
Let &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; be handlebodies of genus &quot;g&quot;, and let ƒ be an orientation reversing homeomorphism from the boundary of &quot;V&quot; to the boundary of &quot;W&quot;. By gluing &quot;V&quot; to &quot;W&quot; along ƒ we obtain the compact oriented 3-manifold

:formula_1

Every closed, orientable three-manifold may be so obtained; this follows from deep results on the triangulability of three-manifolds due to Moise. This contrasts strongly with higher-dimensional manifolds which need not admit smooth or piecewise linear structures. Assuming smoothness the existence of a Heegaard splitting also follows from the work of Smale about handle decompositions from Morse theory.

The decomposition of &quot;M&quot; into two handlebodies is called a Heegaard splitting, and their common boundary &quot;H&quot; is called the Heegaard surface of the splitting. Splittings are considered up to isotopy.

The gluing map ƒ need only be specified up to taking a double coset in the mapping class group of &quot;H&quot;. This connection with the mapping class group was first made by W. B. R. Lickorish.

Heegaard splittings can also be defined for compact 3-manifolds with boundary by replacing handlebodies with compression bodies. The gluing map is between the positive boundaries of the compression bodies.

A closed curve is called essential if it is not homotopic to a point, a puncture, or a boundary component.

A Heegaard splitting is reducible if there is an essential simple closed curve formula_2 on &quot;H&quot; which bounds a disk in both &quot;V&quot; and in &quot;W&quot;. A splitting is irreducible if it is not reducible. It follows from Haken&#x27;s Lemma that in a reducible manifold every splitting is reducible.

A Heegaard splitting is stabilized if there are essential simple closed curves formula_2 and formula_4 on &quot;H&quot; where formula_2 bounds a disk in &quot;V&quot;, formula_4 bounds a disk in &quot;W&quot;, and formula_2 and formula_4 intersect exactly once. It follows from Waldhausen&#x27;s Theorem that every reducible splitting of an irreducible manifold is stabilized.

A Heegaard splitting is weakly reducible if there are disjoint essential simple closed curves formula_2 and formula_4 on &quot;H&quot; where formula_2 bounds a disk in &quot;V&quot; and formula_4 bounds a disk in &quot;W&quot;. A splitting is strongly irreducible if it is not weakly reducible.

A Heegaard splitting is minimal or minimal genus if there is no other splitting of the ambient three-manifold of lower genus. The minimal value &quot;g&quot; of the splitting surface is the Heegaard genus of &quot;M&quot;.

===Generalized Heegaard splittings===

A generalized Heegaard splitting of &quot;M&quot; is a decomposition into compression bodies formula_13 and surfaces formula_14 such that formula_15 and formula_16. The interiors of the compression bodies must be pairwise disjoint and their union must be all of formula_17. The surface formula_18 forms a Heegaard surface for the submanifold formula_19 of formula_17. (Note that here each &quot;Vi&quot; and &quot;Wi&quot; is allowed to have more than one component.)

A generalized Heegaard splitting is called strongly irreducible if each formula_19 is strongly irreducible.

There is an analogous notion of thin position, defined for knots, for Heegaard splittings. The complexity of a connected surface &quot;S&quot;, &quot;c(S)&quot;, is defined to be formula_22; the complexity of a disconnected surface is the sum of complexities of its components. The complexity of a generalized Heegaard splitting is the multi-set formula_23, where the index runs over the Heegaard surfaces in the generalized splitting. These multi-sets can be well-ordered by lexicographical ordering (monotonically decreasing). A generalized Heegaard splitting is thin if its complexity is minimal.

==Examples==

; Three-sphere: The three-sphere formula_24 is the set of vectors in formula_25 with length one. Intersecting this with the formula_26 hyperplane gives a two-sphere. This is the standard genus zero splitting of formula_24. Conversely, by Alexander&#x27;s Trick, all manifolds admitting a genus zero splitting are homeomorphic to formula_24. Under the usual identification of formula_25 with formula_30 we may view formula_24 as living in formula_30. Then the set of points where each coordinate has norm formula_33 forms a Clifford torus, formula_34. This is the standard genus one splitting of formula_24. (See also the discussion at Hopf bundle.)
; Stabilization: Given a Heegaard splitting &quot;H&quot; in &quot;M&quot; the stabilization of &quot;H&quot; is formed by taking the connected sum of the pair formula_36 with the pair formula_37. It is easy to show that the stabilization procedure yields stabilized splittings. Inductively, a splitting is standard if it is the stabilization of a standard splitting.
; Lens spaces: All have a standard splitting of genus one. This is the image of the Clifford torus in formula_24 under the quotient map used to define the lens space in question. It follows from the structure of the mapping class group of the two-torus that only lens spaces have splittings of genus one.
; Three-torus: Recall that the three-torus formula_39 is the Cartesian product of three copies of formula_40 (circles). Let formula_41 be a point of formula_40 and consider the graph formula_43. It is an easy exercise to show that &quot;V&quot;, a regular neighborhood of formula_44, is a handlebody as is formula_45. Thus the boundary of &quot;V&quot; in formula_39 is a Heegaard splitting and this is the standard splitting of formula_39. It was proved by Charles Frohman and Joel Hass that any other genus 3 Heegaard splitting of the three-torus is topologically equivalent to this one. Michel Boileau and Jean-Pierre Otal proved that in general any Heegaard splitting of the three-torus is equivalent to the result of stabilizing this example.

==Theorems==
; Alexander&#x27;s lemma: Up to isotopy, there is a unique (piecewise linear) embedding of the two-sphere into the three-sphere. (In higher dimensions this is known as the Schoenflies theorem. In dimension two this is the Jordan curve theorem.) This may be restated as follows: the genus zero splitting of formula_24 is unique.
; Waldhausen&#x27;s theorem: Every splitting of formula_24 is obtained by stabilizing the unique splitting of genus zero.

Suppose now that &quot;M&quot; is a closed orientable three-manifold.
; Reidemeister–Singer theorem: For any pair of splittings formula_50 and formula_51 in &quot;M&quot; there is a third splitting formula_52 in &quot;M&quot; which is a stabilization of both.
; Haken&#x27;s lemma: Suppose that formula_53 is an essential two-sphere in &quot;M&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is a Heegaard splitting. Then there is an essential two-sphere formula_54 in &quot;M&quot; meeting &quot;H&quot; in a single curve.

==Classifications==

There are several classes of three-manifolds where the set of Heegaard splittings is completely known. For example, Waldhausen&#x27;s Theorem shows that all splittings of formula_24 are standard. The same holds for lens spaces (as proved by Francis Bonahon and Otal).

Splittings of Seifert fiber spaces are more subtle. Here, all splittings may be isotoped to be vertical or horizontal (as proved by Yoav Moriah and Jennifer Schultens).

 classified splittings of torus bundles (which includes all three-manifolds with Sol geometry). It follows from their work that all torus bundles have a unique splitting of minimal genus. All other splittings of the torus bundle are stabilizations of the minimal genus one.

A paper of classifies the Heegaard splittings of hyperbolic three-manifolds which are two-bridge knot complements.

Computational methods can be used to determine or approximate the Heegaard genus of a 3-manifold. John Berge&#x27;s software Heegaard studies Heegaard splittings generated by the fundamental group of a manifold.

==Applications and connections==

===Minimal surfaces===

Heegaard splittings appeared in the theory of minimal surfaces first in the work of Blaine Lawson who proved that embedded minimal surfaces in compact manifolds of positive sectional curvature are Heegaard splittings. This result was extended by William Meeks to flat manifolds, except he proves that an embedded minimal surface in a flat three-manifold is either a Heegaard surface or totally geodesic.
Meeks and Shing-Tung Yau went on to use results of Waldhausen to prove results about the topological uniqueness of minimal surfaces of finite genus in formula_56. The final topological classification of embedded minimal surfaces in formula_56 was given by Meeks and Frohman. The result relied heavily on techniques developed for studying the topology of Heegaard splittings.

===Heegaard Floer homology===
Heegaard diagrams, which are simple combinatorial descriptions of Heegaard splittings, have been used extensively to construct invariants of three-manifolds. The most recent example of this is the Heegaard Floer homology of Peter Ozsvath and Zoltán Szabó. The theory uses the formula_58 symmetric product of a Heegaard surface as the ambient space, and tori built from the boundaries of meridian disks for the two handlebodies as the Lagrangian submanifolds.

==History==

The idea of a Heegaard splitting was introduced by . While Heegaard splittings were studied extensively by mathematicians such as Wolfgang Haken and Friedhelm Waldhausen in the 1960s, it was not until a few decades later that the field was rejuvenated by , primarily through their concept of strong irreducibility.

<text>The Sombrero Galaxy (also known as Messier Object 104, M104 or NGC 4594) is a peculiar galaxy of unclear classification in the constellation borders of Virgo and Corvus, being about from the Milky Way galaxy. It is a member of the Virgo II Groups, a series of galaxies and galaxy clusters strung out from the southern edge of the Virgo Supercluster. It has an isophotal diameter of approximately , making it slightly bigger in size than the Milky Way. 

It has a bright nucleus, an unusually large central bulge, and a prominent dust lane in its outer disk, which from Earth is viewed almost edge-on. The dark dust lane and the bulge give it the appearance of a sombrero hat (thus the name). Astronomers initially thought the halo was small and light, indicative of a spiral galaxy; but the Spitzer Space Telescope found that the halo was significantly larger and more massive than previously thought, indicative of a giant elliptical galaxy. 

The galaxy has an apparent magnitude of +8.0, making it easily visible with amateur telescopes, and is considered by some authors to be the galaxy with the highest absolute magnitude within a radius of 10 megaparsecs of the Milky Way. Its large bulge, central supermassive black hole, and dust lane all attract the attention of professional astronomers.

==Observation history==
===Discovery===
The Sombrero Galaxy was discovered on May 11, 1781 by Pierre Méchain, who described the object in a May 1783 letter to J. Bernoulli that was later published in the &quot;Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch&quot;. Charles Messier made a handwritten note about this and five other objects (now collectively recognized as M104 – M109) to his personal list of objects now known as the Messier Catalogue, but it was not &quot;officially&quot; included until 1921. William Herschel independently discovered the object in 1784 and additionally noted the presence of a &quot;dark stratum&quot; in the galaxy&#x27;s disc, what is now called a dust lane. Later astronomers were able to connect Méchain&#x27;s and Herschel&#x27;s observations.

===Designation as a Messier object===
In 1921, Camille Flammarion found Messier&#x27;s personal list of the Messier objects including the hand-written notes about the Sombrero Galaxy. This was identified with object 4594 in the New General Catalogue, and Flammarion declared that it should be included in the Messier Catalogue. Since this time, the Sombrero Galaxy has been known as &quot;M104&quot;.

==Dust ring==
As noted above, this galaxy&#x27;s most striking feature is the dust lane that crosses in front of the bulge of the galaxy. This dust lane is actually a symmetrical ring that encloses the bulge of the galaxy. Most of the cold atomic hydrogen gas and the dust lie within this ring. The ring might also contain most of the Sombrero Galaxy&#x27;s cold molecular gas, although this is an inference based on observations with low resolution and weak detections. Additional observations are needed to confirm that the Sombrero galaxy&#x27;s molecular gas is constrained to the ring. Based on infrared spectroscopy, the dust ring is the primary site of star formation within this galaxy.

==Nucleus==
The nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). These are nuclear regions where ionized gas is present, but the ions are only weakly ionized (i.e. the atoms are missing relatively few electrons). The source of energy for ionizing the gas in LINERs has been debated extensively. Some LINER nuclei may be powered by hot, young stars found in star formation regions, whereas other LINER nuclei may be powered by active galactic nuclei (highly energetic regions that contain supermassive black holes). Infrared spectroscopy observations have demonstrated that the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy is probably devoid of any significant star formation activity. However, a supermassive black hole has been identified in the nucleus (as discussed in the subsection below), so this active galactic nucleus is probably the energy source that weakly ionizes the gas in the Sombrero Galaxy.

===Central supermassive black hole===
In the 1990s, a research group led by John Kormendy demonstrated that a supermassive black hole is present within the Sombrero Galaxy. Using spectroscopy data from both the CFHT and the Hubble Space Telescope, the group showed that the speed of revolution of the stars within the center of the galaxy could not be maintained unless a mass 1 billion times that of the Sun, , is present in the center. This is among the most massive black holes measured in any nearby galaxy, and is the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole to Earth.

===Synchrotron radiation===
At radio and X-ray wavelengths, the nucleus is a strong source of synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is produced when high-velocity electrons oscillate as they pass through regions with strong magnetic fields. This emission is quite common for active galactic nuclei. Although radio synchrotron radiation may vary over time for some active galactic nuclei, the luminosity of the radio emission from the Sombrero Galaxy varies only 10–20%.

===Unidentified terahertz radiation===
In 2006, two groups published measurements of the terahertz radiation from the nucleus of the Sombrero Galaxy at a wavelength of . This terahertz radiation was found not to originate from the thermal emission from dust (which is commonly seen at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths), synchrotron radiation (which is commonly seen at radio wavelengths), bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas (which is uncommonly seen at millimeter wavelengths), or molecular gas (which commonly produces submillimeter spectral lines). The source of the terahertz radiation remains unidentified.

==Globular clusters==
The Sombrero Galaxy has a relatively large number of globular clusters, observational studies of which have produced population estimates in the range of 1,200 to 2,000. The ratio of globular clusters to the galaxy&#x27;s total luminosity is high compared to the Milky Way and similar galaxies with small bulges, but comparable to other galaxies with large bulges. These results have often been used to demonstrate that the number of a galaxy&#x27;s globular clusters is thought to be related to the size of its bulge. The surface density of the globular clusters generally follows the bulge&#x27;s light profile, except near the galaxy&#x27;s center.

==Distance, mass and brightness==
At least two methods have been used to measure the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy.

The first method relies on comparing the measured fluxes from the galaxy&#x27;s planetary nebulae to the known luminosity of planetary nebulae in the Milky Way. This method gave the distance to the Sombrero Galaxy as .

The second method is the surface brightness fluctuations method, which uses the grainy appearance of the galaxy&#x27;s bulge to estimate the distance to it. Nearby galaxy bulges appear very grainy, while more distant bulges appear smooth. Early measurements using this technique gave distances of . Later, after some refinement of the technique, a distance of was measured. This was even further refined in 2003 to .

The average distance measured through these two techniques is .

The mass of M104 is estimated to be 800 billions solar masses

The galaxy&#x27;s absolute magnitude (in the blue) is estimated as −21.9 at (−21.8 at the average distance of above)—which, as stated above, makes it the brightest galaxy in a radius of around the Milky Way.

A 2016 report used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the distance to M104 based on the tip of the red-giant branch method, yielding 9.55 ± 0.13 ± 0.31 Mpc.

==Nearby galaxies and galaxy group information==
The Sombrero Galaxy lies within a complex, filament-like cloud of galaxies that extends to the south of the Virgo Cluster. However, it is unclear whether it is part of a formal galaxy group. Hierarchical methods for identifying groups, which determine group membership by considering whether individual galaxies belong to a larger aggregate of galaxies, typically produce results showing that the Sombrero Galaxy is part of a group that includes NGC 4487, NGC 4504, NGC 4802, UGCA 289, and possibly a few other galaxies. However, results that rely on the percolation method (also known as the friends-of-friends method), which links individual galaxies together to determine group membership, indicate that either the Sombrero Galaxy is not in a group or that it may be only part of a galaxy pair with UGCA 287.

Besides that, M104 is also accompanied by an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy, discovered in 2009, with an absolute magnitude of −12.3, an effective radius of just , and a mass of 3.3×

==Amateur astronomy==

The Sombrero Galaxy is 11.5° west of Spica and 5.5° north-east of Eta Corvi. Although it is visible with 7×35 binoculars or a amateur telescope, an telescope is needed to distinguish the bulge from the disk, and a 10- or 12-inch (250 or 300 mm) telescope to see the dark dust lane.

==In culture==
One artistic work referencing the Sombrero Galaxy is the song &quot;South of the Sombrero Galaxy&quot; by St. Louis folk metal band Ars Arcanum. The gritty sci-fi Western piece is told from the perspective of a man on the run, from both the law and his own troubled past. The Sombrero Galaxy serves as a backdrop for the song’s narrative, blending cosmic imagery with themes of pursuit and regret.

Shortridge was a presidential elector in 1888, 1900, and 1908. He lost the 1914 U.S. Senate Republican primary to veteran congressman Joseph R. Knowland, who was defeated in the general election by James D. Phelan. Shortridge was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1920, riding Warren G. Harding&#x27;s post World War I &quot;Return to Normalcy&quot; campaign. Defeating Phelan and strong candidates from the Prohibition Party and Socialist Party of America, Shortridge won the general election with 49% of the vote. He was reelected in 1926 with 63% of the vote over Democrat John B. Elliott. He served two full terms before being defeated in a primary in 1932.

Shortridge became a prominent voice for racist anti-Japanese forces in California, declaring that a child of Japanese immigrants would regard &quot;himself or herself as a native of Japan. His heart, his affections go out to the native land of the parent.&quot;. Shortridge&#x27;s claims in 1924 were remarkably similar to some of the justifications made for Japanese internment during World War II. Even some senators who wanted to favor northern and western European immigrants found Shortridge&#x27;s anti-Japanese position unnecessary.

Shortridge served as a special attorney for the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. from 1939 to 1943.

== Family ==
His sister, Clara S. Foltz, became the first female lawyer in California in 1878, and the first female deputy district attorney in the U.S. in 1910. She helped him campaign for the Senate.

His brother Charles M. Shortridge (1858–1918) was the owner of the San Jose newspaper The &quot;Daily Mercury&quot; and purchased &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; in 1895.

He was a member of the Bohemian Club. (Varied Types by Edward F. O&#x27;Day)

== Death ==
He died in Atherton, California.

<doc id="864436" wikidata="Q3054130" url="?curid=864436" title="Low frustration tolerance">
<text>Low frustration tolerance (LFT), or &quot;short-term hedonism,&quot; is a concept utilized to describe the inability to tolerate unpleasant feelings or stressful situations. It stems from the feeling that reality should be as wished, and that any frustration should be resolved quickly and easily. People with low frustration tolerance experience emotional disturbance when frustrations are not quickly resolved. Behaviors are then directed towards avoiding frustrating events which, paradoxically, leads to increased frustration and even greater mental stress.

In REBT, the opposite construct is &quot;high frustration tolerance&quot;.

== History ==
The concept was originally developed by psychologist Albert Ellis who theorized that low frustration tolerance is an evaluative component in dysfunctional and irrational beliefs. His theory of REBT proposes that irrational beliefs and the avoidance of stressful situations is the origin of behavioral and emotional problems. As humans, we tend to seek for instant gratification to avoid pain, ignoring the fact that evading a situation now, will make it more problematic later.

== Types of hedonism ==
* Inferential hedonism: People&#x27;s desires are regarding their own hedonic states of pleasure and pain.
* Reinforcement Hedonism: The content of a person&#x27;s desire, is reinforced because of the pleasure that imagining the specific desire brings.

== Stress ==
According to REBT, the way we perceive stressful situations plays a role in how we experience stress. Stress exists as part of the nervous system of humans, and it affects humans&#x27; well-being when the degree of stress exceeds their capacity of managing the situation either temporarily or permanently.

== Implications ==
LFT has been suggested as a main cause of procrastination. According to Dr. Sarah Edelman, LFT causes us to avoid difficult to endure situations and sometimes to avoid them altogether. This can be a problem because &#x27;achieving many of the things that are important and worthwhile requires us to take actions that involve some discomfort.&#x27; Avoiding difficult situations and tasks can also prevent us from dealing constructively with problems, such as ending unpleasant relationships, improving unhealthy lifestyles, and moving on from dissatisfying jobs. Moreover, tasks perceived as boring, difficult or demanding of greater effort, are said to make a person more likely to procrastinate.

== Reducing LFT ==
In REBT, reducing irrational beliefs and increasing rational beliefs can reduce LFT. This cognitive restructuring allows a modification of dysfunctional thinking and acting, and allows people to change thoughts of great distress like:

* &quot;Existing conditions must be changed to give me what I like, otherwise I can&#x27;t stand it and I can&#x27;t be happy at all!&quot;
* &quot;I must have immediate gratification and have to have it, or else I can&#x27;t stand it and my life is awful&quot;
* &quot;I can&#x27;t stand hassles&quot;

Into more rational and less exaggerated thoughts like:
* &quot;I don&#x27;t like existing conditions&quot;
* &quot;I would like immediate gratification&quot;
* &quot;I find hassles and frustrations inconvenient&quot;

== LFT Scale ==
The frustration discomfort scale (FDS), a multidimensional measure for LFT, was developed using REBT theories.
These dimensions were labelled in four categories:
# Emotional intolerance, involving intolerance of emotional distress.
# Entitlement, involving intolerance of unfairness and frustrated gratification.
# Discomfort intolerance, involving intolerance of difficulties and hassles.
# Achievement, involving intolerance of frustrated achievement goals.

==Increasing tolerance==

Ellis said the path to tolerance consisted of many roads, including unconditional self-acceptance, unconditional other-acceptance and unconditional life-acceptance.

<doc id="864438" wikidata="Q4795851" url="?curid=864438" title="Arrangement of hyperplanes">
<text>In geometry and combinatorics, an arrangement of hyperplanes is an arrangement of a finite set &quot;A&quot; of hyperplanes in a linear, affine, or projective space &quot;S&quot;. 
Questions about a hyperplane arrangement &quot;A&quot; generally concern geometrical, topological, or other properties of the complement, &quot;M&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), which is the set that remains when the hyperplanes are removed from the whole space. One may ask how these properties are related to the arrangement and its intersection semilattice.
The intersection [[semilattice]] of &quot;A&quot;, written &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), is the set of all subspaces that are obtained by intersecting some of the hyperplanes; among these subspaces are &quot;S&quot; itself, all the individual hyperplanes, all intersections of pairs of hyperplanes, etc. (excluding, in the affine case, the empty set). These intersection subspaces of &quot;A&quot; are also called the flats of &quot;A&quot;. The intersection semilattice &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is partially ordered by &quot;reverse inclusion&quot;. 

If the whole space &quot;S&quot; is 2-dimensional, the hyperplanes are lines; such an arrangement is often called an [[arrangement of lines]]. Historically, real arrangements of lines were the first arrangements investigated. If &quot;S&quot; is 3-dimensional one has an arrangement of planes.
== General theory ==

=== The intersection semilattice and the matroid ===

The intersection semilattice &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a meet semilattice and more specifically is a geometric semilattice. If the arrangement is linear or projective, or if the intersection of all hyperplanes is nonempty, the intersection lattice is a geometric lattice.
(This is why the semilattice must be ordered by reverse inclusion—rather than by inclusion, which might seem more natural but would not yield a geometric (semi)lattice.)

When &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a lattice, the matroid of &quot;A&quot;, written &quot;M&quot;(&quot;A&quot;), has &quot;A&quot; for its ground set and has rank function &quot;r&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) := codim(&quot;f(B)&quot;), where &quot;B&quot; is any subset of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;f(B)&quot; is the intersection of the hyperplanes in &quot;B&quot;. In general, when &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a semilattice, there is an analogous matroid-like structure called a semimatroid, which is a generalization of a matroid (and has the same relationship to the intersection semilattice as does the matroid to the lattice in the lattice case), but is not a matroid if &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is not a lattice.

=== Polynomials ===

For a subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot;, let us define &quot;f&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) := the intersection of the hyperplanes in &quot;B&quot;; this is &quot;S&quot; if &quot;B&quot; is empty. 
The characteristic polynomial of &quot;A&quot;, written &quot;pA&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), can be defined by 

:formula_1

summed over all subsets &quot;B&quot; of &quot;A&quot; except, in the affine case, subsets whose intersection is empty. (The dimension of the empty set is defined to be −1.) This polynomial helps to solve some basic questions; see below.
Another polynomial associated with &quot;A&quot; is the Whitney-number polynomial &quot;wA&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), defined by

:formula_2

summed over &quot;B&quot; ⊆ &quot;C&quot; ⊆ &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) is nonempty.

Being a geometric lattice or semilattice, &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) has a characteristic polynomial, &quot;p&quot;&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;), which has an extensive theory (see matroid). Thus it is good to know that &quot;p&quot;&quot;A&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; &quot;p&quot;&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;), where &quot;i&quot; is the smallest dimension of any flat, except that in the projective case it equals &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 1&quot;p&quot;&quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;). 
The Whitney-number polynomial of &quot;A&quot; is similarly related to that of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). 
(The empty set is excluded from the semilattice in the affine case specifically so that these relationships will be valid.)

=== The Orlik–Solomon algebra ===

The intersection semilattice determines another combinatorial invariant of the arrangement, the Orlik–Solomon algebra. To define it, fix a commutative subring &quot;K&quot; of the base field and form the exterior algebra &quot;E&quot; of the vector space
:formula_3
generated by the hyperplanes.
A chain complex structure is defined on &quot;E&quot; with the usual boundary operator formula_4.
The Orlik–Solomon algebra is then the quotient of &quot;E&quot; by the ideal generated by elements of the form formula_5 for which formula_6 have empty intersection, and by boundaries of elements of the same form for which formula_7 has codimension less than &quot;p&quot;.

== Real arrangements ==

In real affine space, the complement is disconnected: it is made up of separate pieces called cells or regions or chambers, each of which is either a bounded region that is a convex polytope, or an unbounded region that is a convex polyhedral region which goes off to infinity. 
Each flat of &quot;A&quot; is also divided into pieces by the hyperplanes that do not contain the flat; these pieces are called the faces of &quot;A&quot;. 
The regions are faces because the whole space is a flat. 
The faces of codimension 1 may be called the facets of &quot;A&quot;. 
The face semilattice of an arrangement is the set of all faces, ordered by &quot;inclusion&quot;. Adding an extra top element to the face semilattice gives the face lattice.

In two dimensions (i.e., in the real affine plane) each region is a convex polygon (if it is bounded) or a convex polygonal region which goes off to infinity. 
* As an example, if the arrangement consists of three parallel lines, the intersection semilattice consists of the plane and the three lines, but not the empty set. There are four regions, none of them bounded. 
* If we add a line crossing the three parallels, then the intersection semilattice consists of the plane, the four lines, and the three points of intersection. There are eight regions, still none of them bounded. 
* If we add one more line, parallel to the last, then there are 12 regions, of which two are bounded parallelograms.

Typical problems about an arrangement in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real space are to say how many regions there are, or how many faces of dimension 4, or how many bounded regions. These questions can be answered just from the intersection semilattice. For instance, two basic theorems, from Zaslavsky (1975), are that the number of regions of an affine arrangement equals (−1)&quot;n&quot;&quot;p&quot;&quot;A&quot;(−1) and the number of bounded regions equals (−1)&quot;n&quot;p&quot;A&quot;(1). Similarly, the number of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional faces or bounded faces can be read off as the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot; in (−1)&quot;n&quot; w&quot;A&quot; (−&quot;x&quot;, −1) or (−1)&quot;n&quot;&quot;w&quot;&quot;A&quot;(−&quot;x&quot;, 1).

 designed a fast algorithm to determine the face of an arrangement of hyperplanes containing an input point.

Another question about an arrangement in real space is to decide how many regions are simplices (the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional generalization of triangles and tetrahedra). This cannot be answered based solely on the intersection semilattice. The McMullen problem asks for the smallest arrangement of a given dimension in general position in real projective space for which there does not exist a cell touched by all hyperplanes.

A real linear arrangement has, besides its face semilattice, a poset of regions, a different one for each region. This poset is formed by choosing an arbitrary base region, &quot;B&quot;0, and associating with each region &quot;R&quot; the set &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) consisting of the hyperplanes that separate &quot;R&quot; from &quot;B&quot;. The regions are partially ordered so that &quot;R&quot;1 ≥ &quot;R&quot;2 if &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;1, &quot;R&quot;) contains &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;2, &quot;R&quot;). In the special case when the hyperplanes arise from a root system, the resulting poset is the corresponding Weyl group with the weak order. In general, the poset of regions is ranked by the number of separating hyperplanes and its Möbius function has been computed .

Vadim Schechtman and Alexander Varchenko introduced a matrix indexed by the regions. The matrix element for the region formula_8 and formula_9 is given by the product of indeterminate variables formula_10 for every hyperplane H that separates these two regions. If these variables are specialized to be all value q, then this is called the q-matrix (over the Euclidean domain formula_11) for the arrangement and much information is contained in its Smith normal form.

==Complex arrangements==

In complex affine space (which is hard to visualize because even the complex affine plane has four real dimensions), the complement is connected (all one piece) with holes where the hyperplanes were removed.

A typical problem about an arrangement in complex space is to describe the holes.

The basic theorem about complex arrangements is that the cohomology of the complement &quot;M&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is completely determined by the intersection semilattice. To be precise, the cohomology ring of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) (with integer coefficients) is isomorphic to the Orlik–Solomon algebra on Z.

The isomorphism can be described explicitly and gives a presentation of the cohomology in terms of generators and relations, where generators are represented (in the de Rham cohomology) as logarithmic differential forms

:formula_12

with formula_13 any linear form defining the generic hyperplane of the arrangement.

==Technicalities==

Sometimes it is convenient to allow the degenerate hyperplane, which is the whole space &quot;S&quot;, to belong to an arrangement. If &quot;A&quot; contains the degenerate hyperplane, then it has no regions because the complement is empty. However, it still has flats, an intersection semilattice, and faces. The preceding discussion assumes the degenerate hyperplane is not in the arrangement.

Sometimes one wants to allow repeated hyperplanes in the arrangement. We did not consider this possibility in the preceding discussion, but it makes no material difference.

<text>The organized system of Minnesota State Highways (typically abbreviated as MN or TH, and called Trunk Highways), the state highway system for the US state of Minnesota, was created in 1920 under the &quot;Babcock Amendment&quot; to the state constitution. No real pattern exists for the numbering of highways. Route commissioning beyond these routes was by legislative action, thus the term legislative route. This included additions and revisions that took place when US and Interstate Highway Systems were commissioned.

Minnesota state highway markers use Type D FHWA font for all route numbers and type C for three-digit route markers only if type D font cannot be used. All routes except interstates use or markers. Interstate markers for three-digit routes are wider shields, and respectively.

Although Minnesota state highways do not follow a distinctive pattern in numbering, they are numbered to avoid conflicting with Interstate Highways and US Highways. Any instance of a state number that matches one is often a &quot;continuation&quot; of the particular route (e.g., U.S. Route 169 and Trunk Highway 169). The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) does not consider this a violation of the rule.

Special routes

There are also routes officially numbered in the 805 and 905, but they do not have signage. Examples include part of the Sibley Memorial Highway that was bypassed in Mendota in the mid 1995 (MN 913A, numbered for former designation MN 13), and Robert Street between I-494 and University Avenue in St. Paul and West St. Paul (MN 952, numbered for former designation US 52).

Other roads under Minnesota jurisdiction include the MN 371 Business Route, which follows the former route of MN 371 through Brainerd. MN 23 also has a designated business route through the city of Willmar (as MN 23 is bypassed around the city), but unlike Business MN 371, Business MN 23 is under local jurisdiction.

Legislative routes defined in the Minnesota Constitution were signed until 1934, when many were renumbered. Several routes, like US Highway 208, were planned in the 1934 renumbering but eliminated before the final plan.

<text>Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara is a Canadian singer-songwriter, actress and composer. She is best known for the album &quot;Miss America&quot;, released in 1988. She released two albums and an EP under her own name, and remains active as a live performer, as a contributor to compilation albums and as a guest collaborator on other artists&#x27; albums.

==Music career==
===Early stages===
O&#x27;Hara was born in the late 1950s in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to a family of Irish Catholic descent. She is the sister of comedic actress Catherine O&#x27;Hara. 

Her early musical tastes included Van Morrison, Dinah Washington, and her father&#x27;s jazz records. She was a student at the Ontario College of Art and Design in the 1970s and was involved in the music scene as a member of Toronto bands Dollars, Songship and Go Deo Chorus.

On March 17, 1978, she and her brother, Marcus O&#x27;Hara, started the Martian Awareness Ball, an event that continues to this day every Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day at the Horseshoe Tavern.

In 1983, O&#x27;Hara left Go Deo and was signed by Virgin Records. Her contract with Virgin continued and eventually led to the 1988 release of &quot;Miss America&quot;. O&#x27;Hara later reflected on the production experience, noting &quot;I loved the Celtic crosses and the sheep rolling around the hills by the studio in Wales. But for Virgin to go from, &#x27;You can do whatever you want&#x27;, to &#x27;What have you done?&#x27;—that was tough.&quot;

In addition, she did some work as a graphic artist, including lettering for the cover of Dalbello&#x27;s album &quot;whomanfoursays&quot;.

===Debut album===

In 1987, Michael Brook saw O&#x27;Hara in performance and soon took on the job of producing O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s attempts at an album. He ultimately added new vocals to and remixed material that was originally recorded by Joe Boyd in 1984. At least one of the songs, &quot;To Cry About&quot;, had been written as early as 1980. According to the liner notes of a later reissue, six of the tracks were recorded in 1984, four in 1988, and one in 1983 and mixed later.

=== 1990s–2000s ===
On their 1990 album &quot;The Caution Horses&quot;, the Cowboy Junkies recorded a sparse, haunting version of O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s song &quot;You Will Be Loved Again&quot;. In 1991, O&#x27;Hara followed up with a four-song EP of Christmas material. Following the &quot;Christmas EP&quot;, O&#x27;Hara took on several acting roles and appeared as a vocalist on recordings by a variety of other artists, including Morrissey (&quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot;), John &amp; Mary, Bruce Cockburn, Holly Cole, Bob Wiseman, Meryn Cadell, The Henrys and Neko Case. She performed &quot;Dark, Dear Heart&quot; at John Candy&#x27;s funeral in March 1994. She also contributed songs to a number of compilation albums, including tributes to Vic Chesnutt and Kurt Weill, and participated in a 1994 Christmas concert with Holly Cole, Rebecca Jenkins, Jane Siberry and Victoria Williams, which was released as the album &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot;. As well, she has occasionally performed in musical theatre, most notably productions of Tom Waits&#x27; experimental rock opera &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, stealing the show according to Pitchfork.com.

During an R.E.M. concert in Toronto in 1999, Michael Stipe brought O&#x27;Hara on stage and declared her a &quot;national treasure&quot;. Other artists who are said to be fans include Kristin Hersh, Radiohead, Dave Matthews and Rickie Lee Jones. However, she did not release a new recording under her own name until 2001, when she and longtime guitarist Rusty McCarthy contributed to the soundtrack for the Canadian film &quot;Apartment Hunting&quot; (in which she also acted).

On October 4 and 5, 2006, O&#x27;Hara performed Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (with Gavin Friday) and &quot;The Window&quot; at &quot;Came So Far For Beauty&quot;, the Leonard Cohen Tribute organised by Hal Willner at The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. She performed at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Minehead, England, over the weekend of April 27 to 29, 2007, and with Howe Gelb and friends at the Barbican Centre in London on May 2, 2007.

O&#x27;Hara also performed at Toronto&#x27;s Canwest Cabaret Festival in both 2008 and 2009. In 2008, she performed at tribute shows to Cohen, Weill and Duke Ellington, and in 2009, she participated in a musical improvisation show with Michael Snow and Aidan Closs. She also gave a rare radio interview to promote the 2009 show, appearing on CBC Radio One&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; on October 28 — and performing an impromptu duet of &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; with host Jian Ghomeshi.

O&#x27;Hara sings the theme song for &quot;Someone Knows Something&quot;, a true-crime podcast from the CBC. The song was written by Bob Wiseman.

On November 12, 2017, O&#x27;Hara performed a rare live show at Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, The Netherlands. O&#x27;Hara was invited by artist Perfume Genius who curated a program for the festival.

==Work with other artists and acting==
She appeared in the 1985 film &quot;The Last Polka&quot; as Gerta Lemon, one half of the Lemon Sisters singing duo alongside Catherine as Sylvie Lemon.

In December 1989 she was featured in the Razorbacks&#x27; CBC Television Christmas special &quot;It&#x27;s a Razorbacks Christmas Barbeque&quot;, for which she received a Gemini Award nomination for Best Performance in a Variety or Performing Arts Program or Series at the 5th Gemini Awards in 1990.

O&#x27;Hara sang backup vocals for Morrissey on his song &quot;November Spawned a Monster&quot;. She contributed to four albums by Bob Wiseman: &quot;In Her Dream&quot;, &quot;Accidentally Acquired Beliefs&quot;, &quot;Theme and Variations&quot;, and &quot;Giulietta Masina At The Oscars Crying&quot;. She also contributed to Justin Rutledge&#x27;s album &quot;No Never Alone&quot;. She recorded a duet with Tindersticks called &quot;Peanuts&quot;, which appeared on their 2010 album &quot;Falling Down A Mountain&quot;. On May 15, 2009, in Toronto, Will Oldham brought her on stage to perform a cover of John Prine&#x27;s &quot;In Spite of Ourselves&quot;.

O&#x27;Hara has made several film appearances. She acts alongside Tom Waits in &quot;Candy Mountain&quot; (1986), directed by Robert Frank and Rudy Wurlitzer. O&#x27;Hara has a leading role in &quot;Museum Hours&quot; (2012), set in and around the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, directed by Jem Cohen.

In 2024 she performed the voice of classical violinist Kathleen Parlow in the film &quot;Measures for a Funeral&quot;.

==Tributes==
Musician Steve Adey recorded a song titled &quot;Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara&quot; on his 2006 LP &quot;All Things Real&quot;.

Adey also covered &quot;To Cry About&quot; on his 2017 LP &quot;Do Me a Kindness&quot;.

“Something To Cry About” in the short story collection &quot;Radium Girl&quot; by Sofi Papamarko was inspired by the song “To Cry About” and built around three prompts given to the author by the singer on request.

Bria Salmena recorded a cover of &quot;When You Know Why You&#x27;re Happy&quot; on her 2023 EP &quot;Cuntry Covers, Vol. 2&quot;.

<text>Jenny Offill (born November 14, 1968) is an American novelist and editor. Her novel &quot;Dept. of Speculation&quot; was named one of &quot;The 10 Best Books of 2014&quot; by &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.
==Early life==
Jenny Offill is the only child of two private-school English teachers. She spent her childhood years in various American states, including Massachusetts, California, Indiana, and North Carolina, where she attended high school and received a BA degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and later, at Stanford University, was a Stegner Fellow in Fiction. After graduating, she worked a number of odd jobs: waitress, bartender, caterer, cashier, medical transcriber, fact-checker, and ghost-writer.

&quot;I went to UNC-Chapel Hill as an undergraduate and I studied with Doris Betts, Jill McCorkle and Robert Kirkpatrick among others. All three were great mentors to me as a young writer. Later, I got a Stegner Fellowship at Stanford. My big influence there was Gilbert Sorrentino...&quot;&lt;br&gt;—Jenny Offill, to Ellen Birkett Morris

==Career==
===Writing===
Offill&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Last Things&quot;, was published in 1999 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and in the UK by Bloomsbury. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable book and a finalist for the &quot;L.A Times&quot; First Book Award. Offill&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Dept. of Speculation&quot;, was published in January 2014 and was named one of the 10 Best Books of 2014 by the &quot;New York Times&quot; Book Review. &quot;Dept. of Speculation&quot; has been shortlisted for the Folio Prize in the UK, the Pen/Faulkner Award and the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; Fiction Award. In 2016 Offill was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Her work has appeared in the &quot;Paris Review&quot;. She is also the co-editor with Elissa Schappell of two anthologies of essays and the author of several children&#x27;s books. Offill&#x27;s short fiction has appeared in Electric Literature and Significant Objects.

&quot;I have always liked compressed and fragmentary forms. I trace it back to my mind being blown by John Berryman when I was nineteen.&quot;&lt;br&gt;—Jenny Offill, about &quot;Dept. of Speculation&quot;
Her third novel, &quot;Weather&quot;, was shortlisted for the 2020 Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction, and in December 2020, Emily Temple of Literary Hub reported that the novel had made 13 lists of the best books of 2020.

=== Teaching ===
Offill has taught in the MFA programs at Brooklyn College, Syracuse University, Columbia University and Queens University of Charlotte. She served as Visiting Writer at Syracuse University and Sarah Lawrence College, and as Writer-in-Residence at Vassar College and Pratt University. She is currently the Writer-in-Residence at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, NY.

<doc id="864458" wikidata="Q2260732" url="?curid=864458" title="General Zod">
<text>General Zod is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Superman. The character, who first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #283 (April 1961), was created by Robert Bernstein and initially designed by George Papp. As a Kryptonian, he exhibits the same powers and abilities as Superman and is consequently viewed as one of his greatest enemies alongside Lex Luthor, Darkseid, and Brainiac. He is also well known for his catchphrase &quot;Kneel before Zod!&quot;

Originally bald and clean-shaven, Zod&#x27;s look in popular culture was defined by the character&#x27;s depiction by Terence Stamp in the films &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1981). Eventually, the character was reintroduced to the DC Multiverse with black hair and a goatee similar to Stamp&#x27;s portrayal. A different version of Zod was portrayed by Michael Shannon in the DC Extended Universe films &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), &quot;Batman v Superman&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023). 
==Fictional character biography==

===Silver Age===
Dru-Zod is a megalomaniacal Kryptonian and the leader of Krypton&#x27;s military forces. When Krypton&#x27;s space program was abolished after Jax-Ur&#x27;s destruction of the inhabited moon Wegthor, Zod tried to take over Krypton using an army of robotic duplicates of himself, all bearing a resemblance to Bizarro. He is sentenced to exile in the Phantom Zone for 40 years for his crimes. In the present, Superman releases Zod after learning that he has already served his sentence, but is forced to return him to the Zone after he attempts to conquer Earth.

During the remaining years before the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Zod and other Zone inmates such as Jax-Ur, Faora, and others, escape from the Phantom Zone and battle Superman and Supergirl numerous times, always being defeated in the end and returned to the Zone.

===Modern Age===

====Interim Zods: 1985–2005====

The first Zod to be introduced following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is the Zod of a so-called &quot;pocket universe&quot; resembling the universe in which the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; comics take place; this allowed for a &quot;Kryptonian&quot; Zod to be introduced while maintaining Superman&#x27;s status as the last of his race in the universe proper. This Zod&#x27;s universe is created by the Time Trapper. Zod (along with companions Quex-Ul and Zaora) devastates the Earth of that universe following the death of its Superboy, despite the best efforts of a Supergirl created by that world&#x27;s heroic Lex Luthor. Eventually, the survivors of this world manage to contact the Superman of the main universe to help them, and he is able to take away the powers of the three super-criminals with Gold Kryptonite; since he is not from that universe, the Kryptonite of that reality has no effect on him.

However, the three vow to some day regain their powers and return to Superman&#x27;s world to kill him. Acknowledging that he can neither afford to leave them on the now-dead pocket Earth to let them die alone nor imprison them on his world, Superman is forced to kill them with Green Kryptonite.

A second incarnation of General Zod is introduced in the 2001 storyline &quot;Return to Krypton&quot;; this Zod is portrayed as that of an alternate reality created by Brainiac 13. He is the head of the Kryptonian military in the alternate reality. Like the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version, Zod holds the Kryptonian equivalent of fascist beliefs. He sends aliens to the bottle city of Kandor and plans a military coup. Zod is defeated by Superman and the Jor-El of Zod&#x27;s alternate reality Krypton.

The third attempt to bring Zod to Modern Age comics is the &quot;Russian&quot; Zod, a Zod of human origin whose origin story is connected to Superman&#x27;s. This General Zod (born Avruiskin) is a Russian who was affected before his birth by his parents&#x27; exposure to Kryptonite radiation. As such, he is empowered by red sunlight and weakened by yellow, the opposite of Superman. After his parents die from radiation, he grows up in a KGB laboratory under the name Zed. Apparently spoken to by the spirit of the Pocket Universe Zod, Russian Zod creates armor which filters the sunlight, and declares himself ruler of Pokolistan. After several inconclusive encounters with Superman, he reveals his long-range plan to turn the sun red and take Superman&#x27;s place. This is temporarily successful until Lex Luthor rescues Superman, gives him a blast of yellow solar radiation to regain his powers, and works to restore the sun. Superman returns to battle Zod, but refuses to kill him. When the sun turns yellow again, the now-vulnerable Zod strikes Superman with all his power at super-speed and is killed due to Superman&#x27;s invulnerability.

The final Zod before the character was finally reintroduced, the Zod of an alternate Phantom Zone appears in the twelve-issue &quot;&quot; storyline, written by Brian Azzarello and penciled by Jim Lee. This Zod lives alone in an alternate Phantom Zone and resents Superman for tampering with it. By his own account he comes from the same Krypton as Superman and was exiled to the Phantom Zone by Superman&#x27;s father, Jor-El. This Zod wears large, spiked black armor and when unmasked, is a bald, white-bearded old man. This incarnation also uses a variation of &quot;Kneel before Zod&quot;. He appears in Metropia, a version of the Phantom Zone created by Superman to resemble a living world (including apparently-living beings). This version was superseded by the present storyline (which features a new Zod, freed from the Phantom Zone).

====General Zod returns: 2006–2011====
General Zod returns to post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; comics in &quot;Last Son&quot;, penned by Geoff Johns, Richard Donner, and Adam Kubert. Dru-Zod II, Ursa, and Non escape from the Phantom Zone and come to Earth to try to turn it into a &quot;New Krypton&quot;. This incarnation is the first Post-Crisis Zod who comes from Superman&#x27;s Krypton, and not from an alternate reality.
The backstory for the three Kryptonians was recounted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #10 (April 2007), and Zod&#x27;s origin was revealed in &quot;Countdown&quot; #30 (October 2007). Prior to the destruction of Krypton, Zod, his wife Ursa, and accomplice Non rebel against their planet&#x27;s oppressive government, but soon become lawless would-be tyrants who lust for power. After an ill-fated insurrection led by Zod, the government sentences the trio to death. However, Superman&#x27;s father Jor-El pleads for the government to mitigate their sentence to imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, accepted on the condition that he would assume responsibility as their jailer. While in the Phantom Zone, Zod and Ursa are able to have a child who is born immune to the Phantom Zone&#x27;s effects, ultimately facilitating their escape, and name him Lor-Zod. On Earth, the boy is discovered by Superman and his wife Lois Lane, who adopt him as their own son and name him Chris Kent.

Alongside Zod, Ursa and Non, 25 other Kryptonian criminals also escape the Zone and defeat a number of Earth&#x27;s heroes, beginning their quest to conquer the planet. Zod ambushes Superman in revenge for Jor-El&#x27;s actions and traps him in the Phantom Zone, which he later escapes with the help of the heroic Phantom Zone prisoner Mon-El. With assistance from his traditional enemies Lex Luthor, Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro, Superman takes on Zod&#x27;s army. Out of nearly thirty Kryptonians, Superman&#x27;s temporary allies successfully kill several, driving the rest back into the Phantom Zone alongside Zod and Ursa, who take Chris Kent with them.
In the later &quot;&quot; arc storyline however, Zod is freed from the Phantom Zone once again by Supergirl&#x27;s mother Alura. The &quot;bottled city of Kandor&quot; is transformed into a populated Kryptonian planet (&quot;New Krypton&quot;), and Zod is appointed the leader of its army. In the &quot;World of New Krypton&quot; &quot;Action Comics&quot; storyline, when Superman decides to see what life is like on New Krypton, he is drafted into the Military Guild under General Zod. Zod and Superman maintain a mistrustful professional relationship. Despite their past, neither seems prepared to behave with marked aggression toward the other. Later, during a Kryptonian ceremony, Zod is shot by the Kryptonian Ral-Dar (who is working with Lois&#x27;s father Sam Lane), leading Zod to appoint Superman as temporary General until his recovery. The two are involved in a Kryptonian political plot, but ultimately apprehend the planet&#x27;s traitor and see a reform of New Krypton&#x27;s Council.

Peace is short-lived, however, due to an attack by the alien Brainiac, who had been responsible for the bottling of Kandor in the first place. In &quot;Last Stand of New Krypton&quot;, New Krypton comes under attack by Brainiac, and Zod engineers a plan to defeat him; Zod is driven by an urge to avenge his prior defeat at the hands of the Coluan Brainiac, when Kandor was bottled from Old Krypton. The storyline ends with the planet&#x27;s destruction, leading Zod to declare war on Earth, sparking the &quot;War of the Supermen&quot; storyline. After a fierce conflict between Superman and Zod in defense of Earth, Zod is pushed back into the Phantom Zone by his son, Chris Kent, who had freed himself from the Phantom Zone and became active as an adult superhero on planet Earth.

====The New 52: 2011–2016====
In 2011, DC chose to revamp its continuity, rebooting many characters while retaining the histories for some others, as part of its The New 52 publishing event. Following this, Zod is hinted at several times. A character resembling Zod makes a cameo in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #5 (March 2012), as a prisoner in the Phantom Zone; and in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #13 (December 2012) a ghost in the Phantom Zone says &quot;Kneel before...&quot; multiple times while attacking Superman, a reference to Zod&#x27;s iconic saying. Zod makes his first full appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23.2: &quot;General Zod&quot; (September 2013), written by Greg Pak, with art by Ken Lashley.

A new origin for Zod is introduced. In it, Zod is born to scientist parents. When he is a young boy, Zod and his parents travel to Krypton&#x27;s wilderness to discover new creatures. Their ship is attacked by the creatures, leaving the family stranded in the jungle. While his parents are killed, Zod manages to survive for one year until Jor-El and his older brother Zor-El save him. After reaching adulthood, Zod becomes one of Krypton&#x27;s best soldiers, attaining the rank of general. Zod develops a hatred towards an alien species called the Char and secretly orders the creation of a Char-looking creature, unleashing it on Krypton&#x27;s population, so he can justify a war against the Char. Jor-El discovers the deception and turns Zod over to the authorities. The council finds Zod guilty of treason and banishes him and his closest followers, Faora and Non, to the Phantom Zone.

Many years later, a mysterious event causes the Phantom Zone to weaken, allowing some of its prisoners to escape. Zod travels to Earth, landing in the Sahara Desert. There, his Kryptonian powers begin to manifest for the first time, brutally slaughtering a group of travelers. Zod is soon attacked by the Justice League of America until Superman and Wonder Woman arrive, the latter restraining him with her magic lasso. Zod recognizes Superman as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El. Superman decides to keep Zod in the Fortress of Solitude&#x27;s alien zoo. While there, he reveals that Faora also traveled to Earth with him, and vows to track her down.

====DC Universe====
In June 2016, the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; event relaunched DC Comics&#x27; entire line of comic book titles, in which General Zod continues to appear within DC titles. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the &quot;Rebirth&quot; branding, opting to include everything under a larger &quot;DC Universe&quot; banner and naming. As part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, General Zod is once again imprisoned within the Phantom Zone. He is trapped within the boundaries of the Black Vault, a secret facility hidden in the Laptev Sea. Amanda Waller sends the Suicide Squad to steal the contents of the Black Vault and bring them back to her, but they unwittingly allow Zod to escape. She attempts to &#x27;recruit&#x27; Zod by implanting a kryptonite explosive in his head, but he finally proves too dangerous when he uses a mirror and his heat vision to literally cut the bomb out of his own skull, forcing Rick Flag to sacrifice himself to seal the Zone before Zod can release his army. Zod manages to retrieve his family from the Zone while fighting alongside the Superman Revenge Squad- Cyborg Superman, Eradicator, Mongul and Metallo- and escapes Earth to establish himself as a dictator on another planet with his family. He nearly kills Hal Jordan when the Green Lantern Corps discover his presence on the planet before both sides are forced to withdraw and recuperate.

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Kryptonians under a yellow sun, General Zod possesses high-level superhuman strength, speed and endurance sufficient to stand against Superman and other Kryptonians; super hearing; x-ray vision; telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; super-breath and freeze-breath; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing and flight. Due to his background as a Kryptonian general, Zod possesses a detailed knowledge of military tactics, battle strategy, and is a competent military leader. Because he was trained in fighting arts long before receiving his abilities, he typically has an edge over Superman&#x27;s brawling skills, over-reliance on superhuman strength, and basic knowledge of advanced human and Kryptonian hand-to-hand combat. However, Zod&#x27;s powers are often inferior to those of Superman, due to the latter being exposed to the yellow sun over the course of his entire life, while Zod typically only gets exposed for a short period of time before being defeated and returned to the Phantom Zone. This greater power combined with his superior control and experience with it gives Superman an edge over Zod&#x27;s superior fighting skills. Additionally, similar to Superman, his strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and his speed is inferior to Speedsters such as the Flash. Like all Kryptonians, he is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation.

This version is the husband of Ursa Zod and father of Lor-Zod who was paroled in the 31st century, but was re-imprisoned in the Phantom Zone by the Legion of Super-Heroes following a failed attempt to conquer the galaxy. In the 21st century, Dru manipulates the amnesiac Superboy into joining him before Lor travels back in time to free his family from the Phantom Zone.

====Live-action====

* A character based on General Zod named Lord Nor appears in the &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; episode &quot;Lord of the Flys&quot;, portrayed by Simon Templeman. He attempts to conquer Earth until he is betrayed by his cohorts and killed by Colonel Cash via a Kryptonite warhead while fighting Superman.
* Major Zod appears in &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed primarily by Callum Blue while an uncredited Sam Witwer provides his initial appearance. This version is a Kandorian as well as husband of Faora and father of Doomsday who was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. Brainiac releases Zod&#x27;s disembodied wraith into possessing Lex Luthor in the fifth season before he is exorcised in the sixth season. After the eighth season, where Tess Mercer uses a Kryptonian device called the &quot;Orb&quot;, the ninth season reveals clones of several Kryptonians, including Zod, were created. After restoring his fellow clones&#x27; powers to gain their loyalty and killing Faora&#x27;s traitorous clone, he begins plotting to fulfill the original Zod&#x27;s destiny by conquering Earth. However, Clark Kent exposes the truth of Faora&#x27;s death, turning the clones against him before sending them to an uninhabited planet where they can establish a colony. As of the tenth season episode &quot;Dominion&quot;, the clones banished Zod&#x27;s clone and his loyalists to the Phantom Zone, where he fused with the original Zod while maintaining both versions&#x27; memories. He lures Kent and Oliver Queen to the Phantom Zone, but the two escape and destroy the exit.
* A Silver Kryptonite-induced hallucination of General Zod appears in the &quot;Supergirl&quot; episode &quot;Nevertheless, She Persisted&quot;, portrayed by Mark Gibbon.
* A time-traveling General Dru-Zod appears in &quot;Krypton&quot;, portrayed by Colin Salmon. Similarly to the &quot;&quot; incarnation, this version is the son of Lyta-Zod and Seg-El, half-brother of Jor-El, and uncle of Kal-El.
* General Zod&#x27;s consciousness appears in the &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; episode &quot;Through the Valley of Death&quot;. Having been saved onto the Eradicator, Tal-Rho uses the device to infect Superman with Zod&#x27;s consciousness before John Henry Irons motivates him to expel it.

===Film===
====Original series (1978–2006)====

* General Zod makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), portrayed by Terence Stamp. Alongside Ursa and Non, he is convicted of crimes against Kryptonian society and sentenced by Jor-El of the Science Council to life imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, shortly before Krypton&#x27;s destruction.
* General Zod appears in &quot;Superman II&quot;, portrayed again by Terence Stamp. Zod and his cohorts escape and reach Earth, where they gain powers, and form an alliance with Lex Luthor to defeat Superman and rule Earth, but they are eventually depowered and defeated by the hero.
* During early development for &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Bryan Singer intended to include Zod, with Jude Law in the role. When Law declined, the character was omitted from the script. Zod was considered again, with Law wanted for the role once more, during early development for the sequel to &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, but the planned sequel never materialized past the development stage.

====DC Extended Universe====

General Zod appears in films set in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), portrayed by Michael Shannon.
* Introduced in &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, this version is the Kandorian head of Krypton&#x27;s Military Guild who initiated a rebellion and formed a battalion called the &quot;Sword of Rao&quot; after becoming dissatisfied with the Law Council&#x27;s decisions, only to be apprehended and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. In the present, following Krypton&#x27;s destruction, the Sword of Rao escape and travel to Earth to find Superman and the Codex, a device containing the genetic code for all future Kryptonians, so Zod can terraform Earth and repopulate the planet with genetically engineered Kryptonians. Ultimately, Superman and the United States military thwart Zod by sending his forces back to the Phantom Zone while Superman reluctantly kills Zod to save a family that he threatened to kill.
* Zod&#x27;s corpse appears in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;. LexCorp takes possession of it, ostensibly to study Kryptonian anatomy and its origins, while Lex Luthor secretly combines the body with his blood and knowledge he stole from an ancient Kryptonian scout ship to create Doomsday.
* An alternate timeline variant of Zod appears in &quot;The Flash&quot;. Due to the Flash creating the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline, Zod and the Sword of Rao killed an infant Kal-El and seek out his cousin Kara Zor-El for the Codex.

====Animation====
* An alternate reality variant of General Zod appears in flashbacks depicted in &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot;, voiced by Bruce Thomas. This version caused Krypton&#x27;s destruction while siphoning energy from its core to power his war machine and implanted his DNA into Lara Lor-Van&#x27;s egg to ensure his legacy&#x27;s survival, leading to the birth of his universe&#x27;s Superman, Hernan Guerra.

===Miscellaneous===
* General Zod, also known as Commissioner Dru-Zod, appears in the novel &quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;, by Kevin J. Anderson. This version is the son of Cor-Zod, former head of the Kryptonian Council, and initially a mid-level bureaucrat before he takes advantage of a major planetary cataclysm and the apparent decapitation of the government to seize absolute power as a militaristic despot and use the Phantom Zone to imprison his political enemies until he is overthrown by a resistance movement led by Jor-El and Zor-El, and banished to the Phantom Zone along with his followers. Afterward, Dru&#x27;s former prisoners, the planetary council, drop the Phantom Zone singularity into an active volcano to ensure he cannot escape, only to cause Krypton&#x27;s core to implode and bring about the planet&#x27;s destruction.
* While General Zod did not appear in series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) due to copyright issues at the time, he appears in the tie-in comics &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; #21 and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; #34 as an Argo City criminal and ally of Jax-Ur and Mala. In the tie-in comic &quot;Justice League Beyond 2.0&quot;, Zod is revealed to be the son of Justice Lord Superman and Wonder Woman.
* The &quot;Injustice&quot; incarnation of General Zod appears in issue #39 of the &quot;Injustice 2&quot; prequel comic. Amidst Batman&#x27;s Insurgency&#x27;s efforts to rescue the Teen Titans from the Phantom Zone, Zod takes advantage and escapes, killing Tim Drake in the process. An enraged Batman combats Zod before Ra&#x27;s al Ghul sends Amazo to kill him. Charles McNider later uses Zod&#x27;s heart in a procedure to save Superboy from the Phantom Zone.

<text>Eric Gerald Farr (né Froberg; January 19, 1968 – June 30, 2023) was an American musician and visual artist. In his musical career he was the singer and guitarist for the San Diego-area bands Pitchfork, Drive Like Jehu, and Hot Snakes, performing alongside fellow San Diego musician John Reis. Froberg also played with the Last of the Juanitas, Thingy, Obits, and Crash Worship.

==Life and career==
Eric Gerald Froberg was born on January 19, 1968, in Santa Monica, California. His family moved to Carlsbad in 1976. Froberg&#x27;s father changed his family&#x27;s name to &quot;Farr&quot; in 1979, but Froberg opted to use the original form as his stage name.

<doc id="864470" wikidata="Q1089650" url="?curid=864470" title="Drive Like Jehu">
<text>Drive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995 and later from 2014 to 2016. It was formed by rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rick Froberg and lead guitarist John Reis, ex-members of the band Pitchfork, along with bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer Mark Trombino, both from Night Soil Man, after their two bands disbanded in 1990. Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s music was characterized by passionate singing, unusual song structure, indirect melodic themes, intricate guitar playing, and calculated use of tension, resulting in a distinctive sound amongst other post-hardcore acts and helped to catalyze the evolution of hardcore punk into emo.

After releasing their eponymous debut in 1991 through local record labels Cargo Music and Headhunter Records, Drive Like Jehu signed to major label Interscope Records along with Reis&#x27; other band Rocket from the Crypt. Their second album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Yank Crime&quot;, gained a cult following, but the group disbanded shortly afterward. Reis continued with Rocket from the Crypt and Trombino became a successful record producer and audio engineer, while Froberg and Kennedy pursued careers outside of music. In 1999, Reis and Froberg began playing together again in Hot Snakes, which was active from 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 until Froberg&#x27;s death in 2023. Reis also re-released &quot;Yank Crime&quot; through his Swami Records label.

== History ==

=== Formation and debut album ===
Prior to forming Drive Like Jehu, vocalist Rick Froberg and guitarist John Reis had played together in Pitchfork from 1986 to 1990, while bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer Mark Trombino played in Night Soil Man from 1987 to 1990. Both bands performed several times together and respected each other. Pitchfork disbanded due to creative differences and their original bassist, Don Ankrom, relocating to San Francisco; shortly afterwards Night Soil Man broke up as well for undisclosed personal reasons. John Reis began hanging out with Kennedy and discovered their mutual admiration for Richmond, Virginia punk band Honor Role. Honor Role guitarist Pen Rollings influenced Reis deeply because his style was &quot;very soulful&quot; and had &quot;personality&quot; despite being a punk guitarist. Thus, he started playing guitar alone for many hours, trying to &quot;merge himself&quot; with the instrument. In 1990, Reis simultaneously formed the &quot;self-proclaimed party band&quot; Rocket from the Crypt and, around one month later, he recruited Froberg (who was also an Honor Role fan), Kennedy and drummer Chris Bratton to form Drive Like Jehu in August 1990. They had around five songs finished but the relationship with Bratton &quot;didn&#x27;t work out&quot; and he was replaced by former Night Soil Man drummer Mark Trombino. The band&#x27;s name was derived from the biblical story of Jehu in the Books of Kings:

While Froberg had sung in Pitchfork, in Drive Like Jehu he also played guitar, adding a rhythm guitar to Reis&#x27; lead. Most of the songs started with Reis&#x27; guitar ideas and the whole band developed them through jam sessions. Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s eponymous debut album was released in 1991 through Cargo Music and Headhunter Records, simultaneous with Rocket from the Crypt&#x27;s debut &quot;Paint as a Fragrance&quot;. Produced by Donnell Cameron and with artwork by Froberg, it was praised as &quot;a quantum leap forward&quot; from Reis and Froberg&#x27;s work in Pitchfork. In 1992 Drive Like Jehu released the single &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot;/&quot;Bullet Train to Vegas&quot; through Merge Records and the song &quot;Sinews&quot; on the Cargo/Headhunter compilation album &quot;Head Start to Purgatory&quot;.

=== &quot;Yank Crime&quot; and breakup ===
Interscope Records, interested in Drive Like Jehu, pursued the band and wound up signing both them and Rocket From the Crypt. Drive Like Jehu released an album first, putting out &quot;Yank Crime&quot; in 1994. Engineered and mixed by Trombino, and again with artwork by Froberg, it had some longer, more complex songs and was described by critics as an &quot;uncompromising maelstrom of technically intricate fury&quot; and &quot;as worthy and awesome as its predecessor&quot;.

In 1995 Drive Like Jehu disbanded, partly so that Reis could concentrate on Rocket from the Crypt, who put out three releases that year and continued until 2005. Drive Like Jehu never officially announced a breakup, but simply stopped playing together. Trombino became a successful record producer and audio engineer, working with bands such as Blink-182 and Jimmy Eat World, while Kennedy left music to become a chemist. Froberg briefly played in Thingy before moving to New York City to pursue a career as a visual artist and illustrator, later reuniting with Reis in the Hot Snakes from 1999 to 2005. In November 2002 Reis re-released &quot;Yank Crime&quot; through his Swami Records label, including on it the tracks from &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; / &quot;Bullet Train to Vegas&quot; and &quot;Sinews&quot; from &quot;Head Start to Purgatory&quot;. Reis currently performs in The Night Marchers, Froberg in Obits, and together they perform as Hot Snakes.

=== Reunions ===

On August 31, 2014, Drive Like Jehu reunited for a performance at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park, accompanied by San Diego Civic Organist Dr. Carol Williams. The collaboration was facilitated by Dang Nguyen, who co-owns Bar Pink in San Diego&#x27;s North Park neighborhood with Reis and sits on the Spreckels Organ Society board of directors. &quot;In February or March [2014], we discussed possibilities and the topic of Jehu came up; that&#x27;s where it started,&quot; said Nguyen. &quot;It was a project they wanted to bring back together. Because, after Hot Snakes and Rocket [from the Crypt] reunited in the last couple of years, I think John and Rick felt that to do something at the organ pavilion was worth getting back together for.&quot; Reis expressed enthusiasm for the organ&#x27;s sound, saying &quot;I especially love the way the low-end sound on the organ is so massive. When I go see organ concerts in the park, I want to collaborate with that sound and with Carol. It&#x27;s not necessarily a &#x27;good idea,&#x27; but it&#x27;s an idea I feel strongly about, and it&#x27;s such a San Diego thing.&quot; According to Williams, &quot;the point of the concert is to open up the (musical) boundaries, not to be narrow. The organ needs a future and any opportunities like this, I really look forward to.&quot;

The novelty of playing with the accompaniment of the organ was a key factor in bringing the band back together. &quot;The weird thing is that we are playing, and that it took something this weird for us to decide to play a couple of songs again,&quot; said Reis. &quot;Only two of us live in San Diego; [Rick] lives in New York and [Mark]&#x27;s in Los Angeles. [Mark and Mike] pretty much haven&#x27;t played music since Jehu or since shortly thereafter. Mark didn&#x27;t even have a drum set until earlier this year, and he bought one specifically for us to play with the organ.&quot; The band played a set of five songs: &quot;Do You Compute&quot;, &quot;Super Unison&quot;, &quot;Sinews&quot;, &quot;If It Kills You&quot;, and &quot;Luau&quot;. Rob Crow, who sang backing vocals on &quot;Luau&quot; on &quot;Yank Crime&quot;, joined them onstage during the song to sing his parts.

Drive Like Jehu scheduled a series of performances for 2015, including April 7 and 14 at The Casbah in San Diego, California, April 8 in Pomona, California; April 11 and 18 in Indio, California at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival; and July 3 in Keflavík, Iceland at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival. On October 18, 2015, Drive Like Jehu performed on the Tunnel Stage at the Treasure Island Music Festival in San Francisco. The band continued to tour in 2016, concluding their reunion tour and effectively ending the reunion in August 2016.

Rick Froberg died of natural causes on June 30, 2023.

== Musical style, influences and legacy ==
Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s music is often classified as punk, post-hardcore, and emo. Their initial biggest influence was punk band Honor Role, particularly its guitarist Pen Rollings. Other influences included Mission of Burma, the Gories, Bastro, Slint, Sonic Youth, the Wipers, and krautrock bands such as Neu! Steve Huey of Allmusic calls them &quot;arguably the most progressive of the leading post-hardcore bands: their lengthy, multisectioned compositions were filled with odd time signatures, orchestrated builds and releases, elliptical melodies, and other twists and turns that built on the innovations of the Dischord label. The result was one of the most distinctive and ferocious sounds in the loosely defined post-hardcore movement.&quot;

Next to contemporaries such as Fugazi and Quicksand, Drive Like Jehu was sometimes overlooked and their music was sometimes difficult for critics to place in a broader context. According to Huey, the band was influential to the development of emo even though the style&#x27;s later sound was quite different from Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s: &quot;The term &#x27;emo&#x27; hadn&#x27;t yet come into wider use, and while Drive Like Jehu didn&#x27;t much resemble the sound that word would later come to signify, they exerted a powerful pull on its development. Moreover, they did fit the earlier definition of emo: challenging, intricate guitar rock rooted in hardcore and performed with blistering intensity, especially the frenzied vocals.&quot; Allmusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett also commented on the emo connection in his review of &quot;Yank Crime&quot;: &quot;Perhaps even more than the debut, &quot;Yank Crime&quot; solidified Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s reputation as kings of emo. While use of that term rapidly degenerated to apply to sappy miserableness by the decade&#x27;s end, here the quartet capture its original sense: wired, frenetic, screaming passion, as first semi-created by the likes of Rites of Spring.&quot; Brendan Reid of Pitchfork Media also notes that &quot;It&#x27;s often easy to forget that DLJ were considered emo in their day; Froberg&#x27;s howls of &#x27;Ready, ready to let you in!&#x27; on &#x27;Super Unison&#x27; seem like a sick parody of stylish vulnerability. Then the song mutates into a gorgeous, snare-drum rolling open sea, and everything you&#x27;ve ever liked (and still like) about this genre in its purest form comes flooding back.&quot;

At the Drive-In frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala stated that &quot;there would be no &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; without Drive Like Jehu.&quot; He declared: &quot;I remember doing a lot of English press and people being like, &#x27;We think you guys are exotic, the names of the songs and flannel and look is exotic.&#x27; I definitely knew what school we came from, and that people like Hot Snakes and Drive Like Jehu were our strongest influences, but they weren’t exactly huge in Europe.&quot; Isaac Brock of the indie rock band Modest Mouse said in 2007: &quot;I love [Drive Like] Jehu. Jehu is one of my favorite all-time bands actually.&quot; Deftones covered their song &quot;Caress&quot; on their 2011 cover album. Brian Cook, bassist for the metalcore band Botch, stated that “Drive Like Jehu was a huge influence on Botch; their writing approach definitely mirrored what we did in terms of banging things out till we had a song.&quot; British hardcore punk group Gallows were also inspired by them and Laurent Barnard singled out John Reis as one of his five favorite guitarists. The Blood Brothers vocalist Jordan Blilie described Rick Froberg&#x27;s lyrics in the band as &quot;equal parts perplexing and relatable&quot; and called his voice &quot;one of my all-time favorites&quot;. He added that the early guitar playing of his own group can be mostly traced back to Jehu. Other artists who have cited them as an influence or expressed admiration for their work are Thursday, Jim Adkins of Jimmy Eat World, Justin Pearson of The Locust, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Matt Pryor of The Get Up Kids, J. Clark of Pretty Girls Make Graves, Violent Soho, Unbroken, Akimbo and Sandrider, KEN Mode, METZ, Matthew Bajda of Funeral Diner, Bryan Giles of Red Fang, Steven Roche of Off Minor and Genghis Tron. Bay Area hardcore band Super Unison named itself after the Drive Like Jehu song.

<doc id="864472" wikidata="Q1143042" url="?curid=864472" title="Handlebody">
<text>In the mathematical field of geometric topology, a handlebody is a decomposition of a manifold into standard pieces. Handlebodies play an important role in Morse theory, cobordism theory and the surgery theory of high-dimensional manifolds. Handles are used to particularly study 3-manifolds.

Handlebodies play a similar role in the study of manifolds as simplicial complexes and CW complexes play in homotopy theory, allowing one to analyze a space in terms of individual pieces and their interactions.

==&quot;n&quot;-dimensional handlebodies==
If formula_1 is an formula_2-dimensional manifold with boundary, and 
:formula_3

(where formula_4 represents an n-sphere and formula_5 is an n-ball) is an embedding, the formula_2-dimensional manifold with boundary
:formula_7

is said to be &quot;obtained from&quot; 
:formula_1

by attaching an &quot;formula_9-handle&quot;.
The boundary formula_10 is obtained from formula_11 by surgery. As trivial examples, note that attaching a 0-handle is just taking a disjoint union with a ball, and that attaching an n-handle 
to formula_1 is gluing in a ball along any sphere component of formula_11. Morse theory was used by Thom and Milnor to prove that every manifold (with or without boundary) is a handlebody, meaning that it has an expression as a union of handles. The expression is non-unique: the manipulation of handlebody decompositions is an essential ingredient of the proof of the Smale h-cobordism theorem, and its generalization to the s-cobordism theorem. A manifold is called a &quot;k-handlebody&quot; if it is the union of r-handles, for r at most k. This is not the same as the dimension of the manifold. For instance, a 4-dimensional 2-handlebody is a union of 0-handles, 1-handles and 2-handles. Any manifold is an n-handlebody, that is, any manifold is the union of handles. It isn&#x27;t too hard to see that a manifold is an (n-1)-handlebody if and only if it has non-empty boundary.
Any handlebody decomposition of a manifold defines a CW complex decomposition of the manifold, since attaching an r-handle is the same, up to homotopy equivalence, as attaching an r-cell. However, a handlebody decomposition gives more information than just the homotopy type of the manifold. For instance, a handlebody decomposition completely describes the manifold up to homeomorphism. In dimension four, they even describe the smooth structure, as long as the attaching maps are smooth. This is false in higher dimensions; any exotic sphere is the union of a 0-handle and an n-handle.

==3-dimensional handlebodies==
A handlebody can be defined as an orientable 3-manifold-with-boundary containing pairwise disjoint, properly embedded 2-discs such that the manifold resulting from cutting along the discs is a 3-ball. It&#x27;s instructive to imagine how to reverse this process to get a handlebody. (Sometimes the orientability hypothesis is dropped from this last definition, and one gets a more general kind of handlebody with a non-orientable handle.) 

The &quot;genus&quot; of a handlebody is the genus of its boundary surface. Up to homeomorphism, there is exactly one handlebody of any non-negative integer genus.

The importance of handlebodies in 3-manifold theory comes from their connection with Heegaard splittings. The importance of handlebodies in geometric group theory comes from the fact that their fundamental group is free.

A 3-dimensional handlebody is sometimes, particularly in older literature, referred to as a cube with handles.

==Examples==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a connected finite graph embedded in Euclidean space of dimension n. Let &quot;V&quot; be a closed regular neighborhood of &quot;G&quot; in the Euclidean space. Then &quot;V&quot; is an n-dimensional handlebody. The graph &quot;G&quot; is called a &quot;spine&quot; of &quot;V&quot;.

Any genus zero handlebody is homeomorphic to the three-ball B3. A genus one handlebody is homeomorphic to B2 × S1 (where S1 is the circle) and is called a &quot;solid torus&quot;. All other handlebodies may be obtained by taking the boundary-connected sum of a collection of solid tori.

<doc id="864489" wikidata="Q1058608" url="?curid=864489" title="Primary sclerosing cholangitis">
<text>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a long-term progressive disease of the liver and gallbladder characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which normally allow bile to drain from the gallbladder. Affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms of liver disease, such as yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes, itching, and abdominal pain.
The bile duct scarring that occurs in PSC narrows the ducts of the biliary tree and impedes the flow of bile to the intestines. Eventually, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver failure. PSC increases the risk of various cancers, including liver cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma. The underlying cause of PSC is unknown. Genetic susceptibility, immune system dysfunction, and abnormal composition of the gut flora may play a role. This is further suggested by the observation that around 75% of individuals with PSC also have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), most often ulcerative colitis.
No effective medical treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis is known. Its most definitive treatment is a liver transplant, but disease recurrence can occur in 25–30% of cases.
PSC is a rare disease and most commonly affects people with IBD. About 3.0 to 7.5% of people with ulcerative colitis have PSC, and 80% of people with PSC have some form of IBD. Diagnosis usually occurs in people in their 30s or 40s. Individuals of Northern European ancestry are affected more often than people of Southern European or Asian descent. Men are affected more often than women. The disease was initially described in the mid-1800s, but was not fully characterized until the 1970s with the advent of improved medical-imaging techniques such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

==Signs and symptoms==
Nearly half of people with PSC do not have symptoms, and are often incidentally discovered to have PSC due to abnormal liver function tests; however, a substantial proportion have debilitating signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms of PSC may include severe itching and nonspecific fatigue. Yellowing of the skin and white portion of the eyes may also be seen. Enlargement of the liver and spleen are seen in roughly 40% of affected individuals. Abdominal pain affects about 20% of people with PSC.

Multiple episodes of life-threatening acute cholangitis (infection within the bile ducts) can be seen due to impaired drainage of the bile ducts, which increases the risk of infection.
* Dark urine due to excess conjugated bilirubin, which is water-soluble and excreted by the kidneys (i.e. choluria)
* Malabsorption, especially of fat, and steatorrhea (fatty stool), due to an inadequate amount of bile reaching the small intestine, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E, and K.
* Portal hypertension, a complication of cirrhosis, which can manifest with esophageal and parastomal varices as well as hepatic encephalopathy (mental status alteration/disturbance caused by liver dysfunction and shunting of blood away from the scarred liver; such that ammonia detoxification is reduced with concomitant encephalopathy) or ascites.

==Cause==
The exact cause of primary sclerosing cholangitis is unknown, and its pathogenesis is improperly understood. Although PSC is thought to be caused by autoimmune disease, it does not demonstrate a clear response to immunosuppressants. Thus, many experts believe it to be a complex, multifactorial (including immune-mediated) disorder and perhaps one that encompasses several different hepatobiliary diseases.

Data have provided novel insights suggesting:
# an important association between the intestinal microbiota and PSC and
# a process referred to as cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in the pathogenesis of PSC.
In addition, longstanding, well-recognized associations are seen between PSC and human leukocyte antigen alleles (A1, B8, and DR3).

==Pathophysiology==
PSC is characterized by inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis) with consequent stricturing (i.e., narrowing) and hardening (sclerosis) of these ducts due to scar formation, be it inside and/or outside the liver. The resulting scarring of the bile ducts obstructs the flow of bile, which further perpetuates bile duct and liver injury. Chronic impairment of bile flow due to blockage and dysfunctional bile transport (cholestasis) causes progressive biliary fibrosis and ultimately biliary cirrhosis and liver failure.

The primary physiological function of bile is to assist in the breakdown and absorption of fat in the intestinal tract; a relative deficiency of bile can lead to fat malabsorption and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

Liver enlargement is seen due to portal hypertension caused by compression of portal veins by the proximate sclerosed intrahepatic bile ducts, and leads to right upper quadrant abdominal pain.

==Diagnosis==
PSC is generally diagnosed on the basis of having at least two of three clinical criteria after secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis have been ruled out:
* serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 1.5x the upper limit of normal for longer than 6 months
* cholangiography demonstrating biliary strictures or irregularity consistent with PSC
* liver biopsy consistent with PSC (if available)

Historically, a cholangiogram would be obtained via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which typically reveals &quot;beading&quot; (alternating strictures and dilation) of the bile ducts inside and/or outside the liver. Currently, the preferred option for diagnostic cholangiography, given its noninvasive yet highly accurate nature, is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), a magnetic resonance imaging technique. MRCP has unique strengths, including high spatial resolution, and can even be used to visualize the biliary tract of small animal models of PSC.

Most people with PSC have evidence of autoantibodies and abnormal immunoglobulin levels. For example, approximately 80% of people with PSC have perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA); however, this and other immunoglobulin findings are not specific to those with PSC and are of unclear clinical significance/consequence. Antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibody are found in 20–50% of PSC patients, and likewise are not specific for the disease, but may identify a subgroup of PSC patients who also have autoimmune hepatitis (i.e. PSC-AIH overlap syndrome).

The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cholangitis (formerly referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis), drug-induced cholestasis, cholangiocarcinoma, IgG4-related disease, post-liver transplantation nonanastomotic biliary strictures, and HIV-associated cholangiopathy. Primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cholangitis are distinct entities and exhibit important differences, including the site of tissue damage within the liver, associations with IBD, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#x27;s disease, response to treatment, and risks of disease progression.

===Classification===
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is typically classified into three subgroups based on whether the small and/or large bile ducts are affected. The subgroups of PSC include:
* Classic PSC
* Small-duct PSC
* PSC associated with autoimmune hepatitis

==Management==
No pharmacologic treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for PSC. Some experts recommend a trial of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid occurring naturally in small quantities in humans, as it has been shown to lower elevated liver enzyme numbers in patients with PSC and has proven effective in other cholestatic liver diseases. However, UDCA has yet to be shown to clearly lead to improved liver histology and survival. Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American College of Gastroenterology do not support the use of UDCA but guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver do endorse the use of moderate doses (13–15 milligrams per kilogram) of UDCA for PSC.

Supportive treatment for PSC symptoms is the cornerstone of management. These therapies are aimed at relieving symptoms such as itching with antipruritics (e.g. bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine); antibiotics to treat episodes of ascending cholangitis; and vitamin supplements, as people with PSC are often deficient in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).

ERCP and specialized techniques may also be needed to help distinguish between a benign PSC stricture and a bile-duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma).

Liver transplantation is the only proven long-term treatment of PSC. Indications for transplantation include recurrent bacterial ascending cholangitis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and complications of portal hypertension. Not all patients are candidates for liver transplantation, and some experience disease recurrence afterward. The reasons why some patients develop recurrent PSC remains largely obscure, but surprisingly, those without recurrence of disease (hence protected from recurrence) are characterized by an increased presence of the potentially pathogenic &quot; Shigella&quot; species.

==Prognosis==
Estimated median survival from diagnosis until liver transplant or PSC-related death is 21.3 years. Various models have been developed to help predict survival, but their use is generally best suited for research and not clinical purposes. A serum alkaline phosphatase less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal has been associated with better outcomes, but its use in predicting long-term outcomes is unclear. An IgA isotype autoantibody to the pancreatic GP2 protein (anti-GP2 IgA antibody) is the first verified prognostic biomarker in PSC. The role of anti-GP2 IgA in PSC was simultaneously investigated and reported by two research groups, and later confirmed by others. Association was demonstrated between anti-GP2 IgA and progressive liver fibrosis, cholangiocarcinoma development and shorter transplantation free survival in PSC patients.

Other markers which may be measured and monitored are a complete blood count, serum liver enzymes, bilirubin levels (usually grossly elevated), kidney function, and electrolytes. Fecal fat measurement is occasionally ordered when symptoms of malabsorption (e.g., gross steatorrhea) are prominent.

===Related diseases===
The development of any of the cancers associated with PSC predicts a poor prognosis. Complications from PSC-associated cancers account for 40% of deaths from PSC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is one of the major known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the biliary tree, for which the lifetime risk among patients with PSC is 10-15%. This represents a 400-fold greater risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma compared to the general population. Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC is encouraged, with some experts recommending annual surveillance with a specialized imaging study and serum markers, although consensus regarding the modality and interval has yet to be established. Similarly, a screening colonoscopy is recommended in people who receive a new diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis since their risk of colorectal cancer is 10 times higher than that of the general population.

PSC is strongly associated with IBD, in particular ulcerative colitis (UC) and to a lesser extent Crohn&#x27;s disease. As many as 5% of patients with IBD are co-diagnosed with PSC, and approximately 70% of people with PSC have IBD. Of note, the presence of colitis appears to be associated with a greater risk of liver disease progression and bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) development, although this relationship remains poorly understood. Close monitoring of PSC patients is vital.

Various forms of gallbladder disease such as gallstones and gallbladder polyps are also common in those with PSC. Approximately 25% of people with PSC have gallstones. Ultrasound surveillance of the gallbladder every year is recommended for people with PSC. Any person with PSC who is found to have a mass in the gallbladder should undergo surgical removal of the gallbladder due to the high risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Osteoporosis (hepatic osteodystrophy) and hypothyroidism are also associated with PSC.

A 2–3:1 male-to-female predilection occurs in primary sclerosing cholangitis. PSC can affect men and women at any age, although it is commonly diagnosed in the fourth decade of life, most often in the presence of IBD. PSC progresses slowly and is often asymptomatic, so it can be present for years before it is diagnosed and before it causes clinically significant consequences. Relatively few data are available on the prevalence and incidence of PSC, with studies in different countries showing annual incidence of 0.068–1.3 per 100,000 people and prevalence 0.22–8.5 per 100,000; given that PSC is closely linked with ulcerative colitis, the risk is likely higher in populations where UC is more common. In the United States, an estimated 29,000 individuals have PSC.

==Research==
Although no curative treatment is known, several clinical trials are underway that aim to slow progression of this liver disease. Obeticholic acid is being investigated as a possible treatment for PSC due to its antifibrotic effects. Simtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against the profibrotic enzyme LOXL2 that is being developed as a possible therapy for PSC.

<doc id="864490" wikidata="Q910130" url="?curid=864490" title="Chemiosmosis">
<text>Chemiosmosis is the movement of ions across a semipermeable membrane bound structure, down their electrochemical gradient. An important example is the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the movement of hydrogen ions (H+) across a membrane during cellular respiration or photosynthesis.

Hydrogen ions, or protons, will diffuse from a region of high proton concentration to a region of lower proton concentration, and an electrochemical concentration gradient of protons across a membrane can be harnessed to make ATP. This process is related to osmosis, the movement of water across a selective membrane, which is why it is called &quot;chemiosmosis&quot;.

ATP synthase is the enzyme that makes ATP by chemiosmosis. It allows protons to pass through the membrane and uses the free energy difference to convert phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP. The ATP synthase contains two parts: CF0 (present in thylakoid membrane) and CF1 (protrudes on the outer surface of thylakoid membrane). The breakdown of the proton gradient leads to conformational change in CF1—providing enough energy in the process to convert ADP to ATP. The generation of ATP by chemiosmosis occurs in mitochondria and chloroplasts, as well as in most bacteria and archaea. For instance, in chloroplasts during photosynthesis, an electron transport chain pumps H+ ions (protons) in the stroma (fluid) through the thylakoid membrane to the thylakoid spaces. The stored energy is used to photophosphorylate ADP, making ATP, as protons move through ATP synthase.

==The chemiosmotic hypothesis==
Peter D. Mitchell proposed the chemiosmotic hypothesis in 1961. In brief, the hypothesis was that most adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis in respiring cells comes from the electrochemical gradient across the inner membranes of mitochondria by using the energy of NADH and FADH2 formed during the oxidative breakdown of energy-rich molecules such as glucose.
Molecules such as glucose are metabolized to produce acetyl CoA as a fairly energy-rich intermediate. The oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the mitochondrial matrix is coupled to the reduction of a carrier molecule such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).
The carriers pass electrons to the electron transport chain (ETC) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which in turn pass them to other proteins in the ETC. The energy at every redox transfer step is used to pump protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, storing energy in the form of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The protons move back across the inner membrane through the enzyme ATP synthase. The flow of protons back into the matrix of the mitochondrion via ATP synthase provides enough energy for ADP to combine with inorganic phosphate to form ATP.

This was a radical proposal at the time, and was not well accepted. The prevailing view was that the energy of electron transfer was stored as a stable high potential intermediate, a chemically more conservative concept. The problem with the older paradigm is that no high energy intermediate was ever found, and the evidence for proton pumping by the complexes of the electron transfer chain grew too great to be ignored. Eventually the weight of evidence began to favor the chemiosmotic hypothesis, and in 1978 Peter D. Mitchell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Chemiosmotic coupling is important for ATP production in mitochondria, chloroplasts
and many bacteria and archaea.

==Proton-motive force==
The movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# Diffusion force caused by a concentration gradient - all particles tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient - cations like protons H+ tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, from the positive (P) side of the membrane to the negative (N) side. Anions diffuse spontaneously in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an electrochemical gradient.

Lipid bilayers of biological membranes, however, are barriers for ions. This is why energy can be stored as a combination of these two gradients across the membrane. Only special membrane proteins like ion channels can sometimes allow ions to move across the membrane (see also: Membrane transport). In the chemiosmotic hypothesis a transmembrane ATP synthase is central to convert energy of spontaneous flow of protons through them into chemical energy of ATP bonds.

Hence researchers created the term proton-motive force (PMF), derived from the electrochemical gradient mentioned earlier. It can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored (chemiosmotic potential) as a combination of proton and voltage (electrical potential) gradients across a membrane. The electrical gradient is a consequence of the charge separation across the membrane (when the protons H+ move without a counterion, such as chloride Cl−).

In most cases the proton-motive force is generated by an electron transport chain which acts as a proton pump, using the Gibbs free energy of redox reactions to pump protons (hydrogen ions) out across the membrane, separating the charge across the membrane. In mitochondria, energy released by the electron transport chain is used to move protons from the mitochondrial matrix (N side) to the intermembrane space (P side). Moving the protons out of the mitochondrion creates a lower concentration of positively charged protons inside it, resulting in excess negative charge on the inside of the membrane. The electrical potential gradient is about -170 mV , negative inside (N). These gradients - charge difference and the proton concentration difference both create a combined electrochemical gradient across the membrane, often expressed as the proton-motive force (PMF). In mitochondria, the PMF is almost entirely made up of the electrical component but in chloroplasts the PMF is made up mostly of the pH gradient because the charge of protons H+ is neutralized by the movement of Cl− and other anions. In either case, the PMF needs to be greater than about 460 mV (45 kJ/mol) for the ATP synthase to be able to make ATP.

===Equations===
The proton-motive force is derived from the Gibbs free energy. Let N denote the inside of a cell, and P denote the outside. Then

:formula_1
where
* formula_2 is the Gibbs free energy change per unit amount of cations transferred from P to N;
* formula_3 is the charge number of the cation formula_4;
* formula_5 is the electric potential of N relative to P;
* formula_6 and formula_7 are the cation concentrations at P and N, respectively;
* formula_8 is the Faraday constant;
* formula_9 is the gas constant; and
* formula_10 is the temperature.
The molar Gibbs free energy change formula_2 is frequently interpreted as a molar electrochemical ion potential formula_12.

For an electrochemical proton gradient formula_13 and as a consequence:
:formula_14 

where
:formula_15.

Mitchell defined the proton-motive force (PMF) as
:formula_16.
For example, formula_17 implies formula_18. At formula_19 this equation takes the form:

formula_20.

Note that for spontaneous proton import from the P side (relatively more positive and acidic) to the N side (relatively more negative and alkaline), formula_21 is negative (similar to formula_2) whereas PMF is positive (similar to redox cell potential formula_23).

It is worth noting that, as with any transmembrane transport process, the PMF is directional. The sign of the transmembrane electric potential difference formula_24 is chosen to represent the change in potential energy per unit charge flowing into the cell as above. Furthermore, due to redox-driven proton pumping by coupling sites, the proton gradient is always inside-alkaline. For both of these reasons, protons flow in spontaneously, from the P side to the N side; the available free energy is used to synthesize ATP (see below). For this reason, PMF is defined for proton import, which is spontaneous. PMF for proton export, i.e., proton pumping as catalyzed by the coupling sites, is simply the negative of PMF(import).

The spontaneity of proton import (from the P to the N side) is universal in all bioenergetic membranes. This fact was not recognized before the 1990s, because the chloroplast thylakoid lumen was interpreted as an interior phase, but in fact it is topologically equivalent to the exterior of the chloroplast. Azzone et al. stressed that the inside phase (N side of the membrane) is the bacterial cytoplasm, mitochondrial matrix, or chloroplast stroma; the outside (P) side is the bacterial periplasmic space, mitochondrial intermembrane space, or chloroplast lumen. Furthermore, 3D tomography of the mitochondrial inner membrane shows its extensive invaginations to be stacked, similar to thylakoid disks; hence the mitochondrial intermembrane space is topologically quite similar to the chloroplast lumen.:

The energy expressed here as Gibbs free energy, electrochemical proton gradient, or proton-motive force (PMF), is a combination of two gradients across the membrane:
# the concentration gradient (via formula_25) and
# electric potential gradient formula_24.
When a system reaches equilibrium, formula_27; nevertheless, the concentrations on either side of the membrane need not be equal. Spontaneous movement across the potential membrane is determined by both concentration and electric potential gradients.

The molar Gibbs free energy formula_28 of ATP synthesis
:formula_29
is also called phosphorylation potential. The equilibrium concentration ratio formula_30 can be calculated by comparing formula_31 and formula_28, for example in case of the mammalian mitochondrion:

H+ / ATP = ΔGp / (Δp / 10.4 kJ·mol−1/mV) = 40.2 kJ·mol−1 / (173.5 mV / 10.4 kJ·mol−1/mV) = 40.2 / 16.7 = 2.4. The actual ratio of the proton-binding c-subunit to the ATP-synthesizing beta-subunit copy numbers is 8/3 = 2.67, showing that under these conditions, the mitochondrion functions at 90% (2.4/2.67) efficiency.

In fact, the thermodynamic efficiency is mostly lower in eukaryotic cells because ATP must be exported from the matrix to the cytoplasm, and ADP and phosphate must be imported from the cytoplasm. This &quot;costs&quot; one &quot;extra&quot; proton import per ATP, hence the actual efficiency is only 65% (= 2.4/3.67).

==In mitochondria==
The complete breakdown of glucose releasing its energy is called cellular respiration. The last steps of this process occur in mitochondria. The reduced molecules NADH and FADH2 are generated by the Krebs cycle, glycolysis, and pyruvate processing. These molecules pass electrons to an electron transport chain, which releases the energy of oxygen to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. ATP synthase then uses the energy stored in this gradient to make ATP. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation because it uses energy released by the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 to phosphorylate ADP into ATP.

==In plants==
The light reactions of photosynthesis generate ATP by the action of chemiosmosis. The photons in sunlight are received by the antenna complex of Photosystem II, which excites electrons to a higher energy level. These electrons travel down an electron transport chain, causing protons to be actively pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid lumen. These protons then flow down their electrochemical potential gradient through an enzyme called ATP-synthase, creating ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The electrons from the initial light reaction reach Photosystem I, then are raised to a higher energy level by light energy and then received by an electron acceptor and reduce NADP+ to NADPH. The electrons lost from Photosystem II get replaced by the oxidation of water, which is &quot;split&quot; into protons and oxygen by the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC, also known as WOC, or the water-oxidizing complex). To generate one molecule of diatomic oxygen, 10 photons must be absorbed by Photosystems I and II, four electrons must move through the two photosystems, and 2 NADPH are generated (later used for carbon dioxide fixation in the Calvin Cycle).

==In prokaryotes==
Bacteria and archaea also can use chemiosmosis to generate ATP. Cyanobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and purple bacteria synthesize ATP by a process called photophosphorylation. These bacteria use the energy of light to create a proton gradient using a photosynthetic electron transport chain. Non-photosynthetic bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot; also contain ATP synthase. In fact, mitochondria and chloroplasts are the product of endosymbiosis and trace back to incorporated prokaryotes. This process is described in the endosymbiotic theory. The origin of the mitochondrion triggered the origin of eukaryotes, and the origin of the plastid the origin of the Archaeplastida, one of the major eukaryotic supergroups.

Chemiosmotic phosphorylation is the third pathway that produces ATP from inorganic phosphate and an ADP molecule. This process is part of oxidative phosphorylation.&#x27;

==Emergence of chemiosmosis==


=== Thermal cycling model ===
A stepwise model for the emergence of chemiosmosis, a key element in the origin of life on earth, proposes that primordial organisms used thermal cycling as an energy source (thermosynthesis), functioning essentially as a heat engine:

:self-organized convection in natural waters causing thermal cycling →
:: added β-subunit of F1 ATP Synthase 
:: (generated ATP by thermal cycling of subunit during suspension in convection cell: thermosynthesis) →
::: added membrane and Fo ATP Synthase moiety 
::: (generated ATP by change in electrical polarization of membrane during thermal cycling: thermosynthesis) →
:::: added metastable, light-induced electric dipoles in membrane 
:::: (primitive photosynthesis) →
::::: added quinones and membrane-spanning light-induced electric dipoles 
::::: (today&#x27;s bacterial photosynthesis, which makes use of chemiosmosis).

=== External proton gradient model ===

Biochemist Nick Lane has proposed the following hypothesis. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents, emitting hot acidic or alkaline water, would have created external proton gradients. These provided energy that primordial organisms could have exploited. To keep the flows separate, such an organism could have wedged itself in the rock of the hydrothermal vent, exposed to the hydrothermal flow on one side and the more alkaline water on the other. As long as the organism&#x27;s membrane (or passive ion channels within it) is permeable to protons, the mechanism can function without ion pumps. Such a proto-organism could then have evolved further mechanisms such as ion pumps and ATP synthase.

=== Meteoritic quinones ===
A proposed alternative source to chemiosmotic energy developing across membranous structures is if an electron acceptor, ferricyanide, is within a vesicle and the electron donor is outside, quinones transported by carbonaceous meteorites pick up electrons and protons from the donor. They would release electrons across the lipid membrane by diffusion to ferricyanide within the vesicles and release protons which produces gradients above pH 2, the process is conducive to the development of proton gradients.

<text>Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), sometimes referred to as &quot;quick codes&quot; or &quot;feature codes&quot;, is a communications protocol used by GSM cellular telephones to communicate with the mobile network operator&#x27;s computers. USSD can be used for WAP browsing, prepaid callback service, mobile-money services, location-based content services, menu-based information services, and as part of configuring the phone on the network. The service does not require a messaging app, and does not incur charges.

USSD messages are up to 182 alphanumeric characters long. Unlike short message service (SMS) messages, USSD messages create a real-time connection during a USSD session. The connection remains open, allowing a two-way exchange of a sequence of data. This makes USSD faster than services that use SMS.

While GSM is being phased out in the 2020s with 2G and 3G technologies, USSD services can be supported over LTE, 5G, and IMS.

== Uses ==
When a user sends a message to the phone company network, it is received by a computer dedicated to USSD. The computer&#x27;s response is sent back to the phone, generally in a basic format that can easily be seen on the phone display. Messages sent over USSD are not defined by any standardization body, so each network operator can implement whatever is most suitable for its customers.

USSD can be used to provide independent calling services such as a callback service (to reduce phone charges while roaming), enhance mobile marketing capabilities or interactive data services.

USSD is commonly used by prepaid GSM cellular phones to query the available balance. The vendor&#x27;s &quot;check balance&quot; application hides the details of the USSD protocol from the user. On some pay as you go networks, such as Tesco Mobile, once a user performs an action that costs money, the user sees a USSD message with their new balance. USSD can also be used to refill the balance on the user&#x27;s SIM card and to deliver one-time passwords or PIN codes.

Some operators use USSD to provide access to real-time updates from social-networking websites including Facebook and Twitter. Between 2012 and 2018, the Wikipedia Zero project provided access to Wikipedia articles via USSD.

USSD is sometimes used in conjunction with SMS. The user sends a request to the network via USSD, and the network replies with an acknowledgement of receipt:
:&quot;Thank you, your message is being processed. A message will be sent to your phone.&quot;

Subsequently, one or more mobile terminated SMS messages communicate the status and/or results of the initial request. In such cases, SMS is used to &quot;push&quot; a reply or updates to the handset when the network is ready to send them. In contrast, USSD is used for command-and-control only.

== Technical details ==
Most GSM phones have USSD capability. USSD is generally associated with real-time or instant messaging services. An SMSC is not present in the processing path, so that the store-and-forward capability supported by other short-message protocols such as SMS is not available.

USSD Phase 1, as specified in GSM 02.90, only supports mobile-initiated (&quot;pull&quot;) operations. In the core network, the message is delivered over MAP, USSD Phase 2, as specified in GSM 03.90. After entering a USSD code on a GSM handset, the reply from the GSM operator is displayed within a few seconds.

While GSM is being phased out in the 2020s with 2G and 3G, a solution is available for supporting USSD services directly from the LTE/5G/IMS network, providing a similar user experience as in GSM.

===Format===
A USSD message typically starts with an asterisk symbol (*) or a hash symbol (#) and is terminated with a hash symbol (#). A typical message comprises digits for commands or data; groups of digits may be separated by additional asterisks.

===USSD mode===
Mobile-initiated
* USSD/ PULL or USSD/ P2A
* when the user dials a code, e.g. *139# from a GSM mobile handset

Network-initiated
* USSD/ PUSH or USSD/A2P
* when the user receives a push message from the network; primarily used for promotional services
==Man-Machine Interface==
The codes below are not USSD codes, these are the related Man-Machine Interface (MMI); they are standardized so they are the same on every GSM phone. They are interpreted by the handset first before a corresponding command (not the code itself) is sent to the network. These codes might not always work when using an AT interface; there are standard AT commands defined for each of these actions instead.

BS is the type of bearer service, some valid values are:
* 11 for voice
* 13 for fax
* 16 for SMS (only valid for barring)
* 25 for data
* &lt;leave blank&gt; for all.

T is number of seconds for the No Reply Condition Timer, default is 20 seconds if not specified.

<text>Ivan Stepanovich Silayev (; 21 October 1930 – 8 February 2023) was a Soviet and Russian politician. He served as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union through the offices of chairman of the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet economy (28 August – 25 December 1991) and chairman of the Inter-republican Economic Committee (20 September – 14 November 1991). Responsible for overseeing the economy of the Soviet Union during the late Gorbachev era, he was the last head of government of the Soviet Union, succeeding Valentin Pavlov.

After graduating in the 1950s, Silayev began his political career in the Ministry of Aviation Industry in the 1970s. During the Brezhnev Era he became Minister of Aviation Industry, Minister of Machine-Tool and Tool Building Industry, and a Central Committee member. When Nikolai Tikhonov&#x27;s Second Government was dissolved, Mikhail Gorbachev appointed him in 1985 deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers in Nikolai Ryzhkov&#x27;s First Government. He left all posts in the central government in October 1990 to focus in his post as chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR, which he had been appointed to in June of that year. There he faced several cabinet difficulties during his tenure, and while he supported the majority of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s policies, he opposed the secessionist policies of Yeltsin, which led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, during his concurrent tenure as Soviet Premier, which he overtook in August 1991. Therefore, a month later, he was removed from the post of Prime Minister of the Russian SFSR and was replaced by acting Prime Minister Oleg Lobov.

Silayev de facto became Prime Minister of the Soviet Union on 28 August 1991 following the failed August coup and the abolishment of the Cabinet of Ministers, when no new cabinet could be formed and the new economic committee, chaired by him since 24 August, was granted the authority of the cabinet. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he continued to work for the Yeltsin administration as the Permanent Representative of Russia to the European Community (the European Union since 1992) until his resignation in 1994. During the 2007 legislative election, Silayev ran as a candidate for the Agrarian Party of Russia.

==Early life and career==
Silayev was born on 21 October 1930, in Baktyzino, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Kazan Aviation Institute in 1954 as a mechanical engineer. In 1959 Silayev became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). During his tenure at the Gorky Aviation Plant (Gorky is now Nizhny Novgorod), where he started in 1954, he advanced from the lowest level to become the plant&#x27;s foreman from 1971 to 1974.

Following this, Silayev served as Deputy Minister of Aviation Industry, and was later appointed Minister of Aviation Industry in 1981 in Nikolai Tikhonov&#x27;s first government. He served briefly as Minister of Machine-Tool and Tool Building Industry of the Soviet Union from 1980 to 1981. At the 26th Congress Silayev was elected to the Central Committee (CPSU). In 1985, during Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s rule, Silayev was appointed deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers and chairman of the Machine-Building Bureau of the Council of Ministers in Nikolai Ryzhkov&#x27;s first and second governments. He served in these posts until he was appointed Premier of the Russian SFSR in 1990. In 1986, he served as head of a government commission into the Chernobyl Disaster.

==Russian SFSR premiership==
===Appointment===
The election of a Chairman of the Council of Ministers – Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), literally Premier of the Russian SFSR, was not considered a very important event; the Premier was elected following the election of the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s deputy chairman, and after a debate on Russian agriculture. Boris Yeltsin, the chairman of the Russian SFSR Supreme Soviet, was ordered to select candidates for the post of Premier to the Supreme Soviet. Mikhail Bocharov, a successful businessman and leader of the cooperative movement, rector of the Moscow Aviation Institute Yuri Ryzhkov, and Silayev were chosen as the candidates. Ryzhkov withdrew his candidacy before the first round of voting was finished. During the election, Bocharov revealed his radical economic reform plan to the Supreme Soviet deputies; in it industry would be privatized, and subsidies to unprofitable enterprises would cease in a 100 Days reform package. Silayev did not have any similar economic reform plans but was widely considered to be Yeltsin&#x27;s favourite for the post.

In the first round of voting, Silayev earned 119 votes, while Bocharov earned 86 votes. To be elected to the post, a candidate needed to win over half of the vote; neither Silayev nor Bocharov succeeded in this. Seeing that Silayev was Yeltsin&#x27;s favourite, and had won more votes than Bocharov, Silayev ran unchallenged in the second election round, and was thus elected by 15 June a large margin. On June 18, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the RSFSR approved the appointment of Silayev as Prime Minister.

Gorbachev tried to break the Silayev–Yeltsin alliance but to no avail. In 1989, Valentin Pavlov, the Prime Minister of the Soviet Union from 14 January to 28 August 1991, had gathered together enough information on the errors and omissions of Silayev to weaken his position as Deputy Premier. Silayev never forgave Pavlov and relations between the two grew colder when Pavlov became the Prime Minister.

===Silayev&#x27;s government===
Silayev repeatedly opined that if he ever was given conflicting instructions by the Premier of the Soviet Union and Yeltsin, he would always &quot;observe the laws of the RSFSR&quot;, meaning he would obey Yeltsin. During his tenure as Premier, Silayev was never the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the government cabinet and was loyal to Yeltsin and the Supreme Soviet. In contrast to his predecessor, Aleksandr Vlasov, Silayev tried to modernise the Russian Government. Silayev decided to break with the old Soviet nomenklatura system of electing cabinet members by electing members using an &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;scientific&quot; basis. To accomplish this, Silayev asked professional psychologists to interview candidate cabinet members. Only 14 of the 200 cabinet candidates were recommended for a post in the government cabinet; even so, several of the candidates were given a post in the new government. All candidate members were selected by either Silayev, Yeltsin, or the Supreme Soviet.

Silayev&#x27;s government lacked ideological unity, and several conservative members were elected to the cabinet in July 1990, among them Oleg Lobov and Gennadii Kulik. In November 1990, Grigory Yavlinsky resigned from his cabinet post, citing the failure of the 500 Days Programme. However, some commentators believe Yavlinsky resigned because of frequent conflict between him and other cabinet members. RSFSR Minister of Finance Boris Fyodorov resigned on 5 December 1990, and accused the First Deputy Premiers of taking important financial decisions on behalf of the ministry and him as minister behind his back. Lobov, the First Deputy Premier in charge of regional development, had become a &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the cabinet. Lobov was Yeltsin&#x27;s favourite, and tried to weaken Silayev&#x27;s position within the cabinet. With the consent of the Supreme Soviet Silayev established a 16-member Presidium for the cabinet.

Another problem facing Silayev was that the Supreme Soviet was usurping the power of the executive branch by strengthening the legislative branch. To accomplish this, the Supreme Soviet established duplicated entities, such as the Committee for Mass Media, which duplicated the functions of the Ministry of Mass Media. Viktor Kisin, the Minister of Industry, told the press that the only employee of his ministry was in fact himself. In July 1990, Silayev agreed to create parallel executive-legislative administrative bodies.

In December 1990, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Russian SFSR entrusted Silayev and his government to create a new plan for economic reform. The plan was finished in April 1991, and was referred to as the &quot;Yeltsin–Silayev Plan&quot;. The plan was heavily influenced by the 500 Days Programme, and supported privatisation and the marketisation of the economy. The reform plan was criticised by an official from the State Committee on Economic Reform of the central government; he called the plan &quot;a statement of intents&quot;; instead of an economic reform, he called it a &quot;manifesto&quot;. A Supreme Soviet deputy noted the proposed reform lacked real statistical insight. Even so, the proposed reform received a majority in a Supreme Soviet vote; Yeltsin&#x27;s supporters knew that his economic reform proposal had to be accepted before the July presidential election. Following the July presidential election, the Russian government resigned, and the post of premier was once again up for election. Silayev had strong competitors for the post, such as Yurii Skokov, but won the election.

==Soviet premiership==

The State Committee for the State of Emergency failed to arrest Silayev or any other high-standing Russian state officials during the August Coup. Silayev was one of several leading Russian SFSR politicians who flew to Gorbachev&#x27;s summer house in the immediate aftermath of the failed coup. On 24 August, the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers issued a decree transferring central government authority over economic and communications ministries to the RSFSR Government, and took control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and KGB archives. With the central government&#x27;s authority greatly weakened, Gorbachev established a four-man committee, led by Silayev, that included Grigory Yavlinsky, Arkady Volsky, and Yuri Luzhkov, to elect a new Cabinet of Ministers. This committee was later transformed into the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet economy (COMSE), also chaired by Silayev, to manage the Soviet economy.

On 28 August 1991, a Supreme Soviet temporarily gave the COMSE the same authority as the Cabinet of Ministers, and Silayev became the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; Premier. The Russian-dominated COMSE was quickly surpassed in authority by the Inter-republican Economic Committee (IEC), which was better thought to work between the different member republics, as its function was to coordinate economic policy across the Soviet Union, and was created by law on 5 September, but members were not immediately selected. Silayev finally also became IEC&#x27;s chairman on 20 September (while other members were different from COMSE), formally strengthening his position in the union, but he presided over a quickly disintegrating Soviet Union and was dismissed as Russian Premier only a few days later. Further disintegration of the USSR, with several republics becoming independent states, led to the transformation of the IEC into the on 14 November, which was to coordinate relations between the union republics and the republics that seceded from the USSR. Silayev remained chairman of the new IEC and was considered &quot;Prime Minister of the Economic Community&quot;, although the office and the community had no future, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union coming only weeks later.

When he first took office, holding the Russian premiership under Boris Yeltsin at the same time, Silayev had wanted to reduce the powers of the central government and give more powers to the Soviet Republics. As he, however, saw Yeltsin&#x27;s rapid actions to undermine the institutions of the Soviet Union, his view changed and he demanded that Yeltsin give back much of the authority of the central government which he had usurped following the August Coup. In this he failed, and his position as Russian SFSR Premier was severely weakened as a result, with him being replaced only a month after his accession to the Soviet premiership. Oleg Lobov, Silayev&#x27;s First Deputy Premier, led the anti-Silayev faction in the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers and managed to oust him on 26 September 1991; Lobov succeeded him as acting Premier of the Russian SFSR. Silayev, as overseer of the economy, was given the task of initiating economic reforms in the Soviet Union in a way that suited both the central government and the Soviet republics. Silayev tried to maintain an integrated economy while initiating the marketisation of the economy. On 19 December 1991, Yeltsin declared the COMSE committee, which served as the Soviet Union&#x27;s last government, dissolved, and Silayev retired from his post, one day after he had been appointed to his new position as a diplomat for Russia. The legality of the dissolution was unclear, as Gorbachev had not concurred with it, and so most members remained in office and continued their work. Оn 25 December 1991, Gorbachev announced his resignation from the post of President of the USSR in connection with the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, meaning that the union government ceased to exist.

==Later career and death==
On 18 December 1991, Silayev was appointed by Yeltsin as the Permanent Representative of Russia to the European Community in Brussels; he resigned from this post on 7 February 1994. In late 1994, Silayev became the President of the Machine-Building Association of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which consisted of more than a hundred civilian and military enterprises and associations, mostly of Russian origin. He became a member of the Ecological Movement &quot;Cedar&quot; in 1995. From 1998, he was President of Industrial Machine, an industrial and financial group; he simultaneously headed the National Committee, which promotes economic cooperation with Latin America. On 26 September 2002, Silayev became Chairman of the Russian Union of Mechanical Engineers. During the 2007 legislative election, Silayev ran as a candidate for the Agrarian Party, but failed to get elected.

Silayev died on 8 February 2023, at the age of 92 in Nizhny Novgorod. He was buried on February 11, 2023, at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow next to his wife, who died on 18 March 2006. The farewell ceremony was attended by 30 to 40 people.

==Recognition==
Silayev was awarded an Order of Lenin on two different occasions—once in 1971, and another during a closed session of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1975, when he was also awarded a Hero of Socialist Labour. He was awarded a Lenin Prize in 1972. In 1981, he was awarded the Order of the October Revolution and in 2002, the National Prize of Peter the Great. On 19 October 2000 and on 21 October 2005, Silayev was awarded the Diploma of the Government of the Russian Federation.

<doc id="864497" wikidata="Q121027" url="?curid=864497" title="Hans A. Pestalozzi">
<text>Hans Adolf Pestalozzi (February 7, 1929 – July 14, 2004) was a Swiss social critic of late 20th century capitalism, which eventually led to his becoming a bestselling author (&quot;Nach uns die Zukunft&quot;, &quot;Auf die Bäume ihr Affen&quot;).

==Biography==
Pestalozzi was born in Zürich. After his university education at University of St. Gallen, he started working for Migros. In the 1960s he also built up the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institut, a think tank named after the Migros founder (who had died in 1962). The institute was established to investigate the range of possible shortcomings and negative effects of capitalism, in particular within Western consumer society, so that they could be combated more effectively.

Pestalozzi fulfilled that task very thoroughly, especially in his lectures, so much so that in 1977 he was fired by Migros. Rather than looking for a new job, he became a freelance writer and self-proclaimed &quot;autonomous agitator&quot; who sided with the fledgling European youth, peace and ecological movements. He preached &quot;positive subversion&quot; and, in a Kantian manner, tried to convince people that using their own intelligence was the right thing to do. Moreover, he demanded a guaranteed minimum income for everybody.

Hans A. Pestalozzi died a recluse by suicide in his home near Wattwil, Canton of St. Gallen.

<doc id="864502" wikidata="Q7621808" url="?curid=864502" title="Strategic National Stockpile">
<text>The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), originally called the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS), is the United States&#x27; national repository of antibiotics, vaccines, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, and other critical medical supplies. Its website states: &quot;The Strategic National Stockpile&#x27;s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.&quot;

In at least 10 government reports published from 2003 to 2015, federal officials predicted that the U.S. would experience a shortage of ventilators and other medical supplies if a large-scale infectious disease outbreak were to occur.

==Locations==
The actual supply of drugs and supplies that make up the SNS are located in 12 secret locations strategically placed throughout the US. The locations appear to look like ordinary commercial warehouses. Inside the warehouses, supplies are stacked on shelves that can measure five stories high. Armed personnel guard the warehouse contents and, according to NPR in 2020, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, &quot;rows of ventilators, which can support people who are having trouble breathing, are kept charged up and ready to roll at a moment&#x27;s notice.&quot;

==Composition==
The SNS holds a variety of items that would be helpful to the general population in the event of a widespread disease outbreak.

===12-hour push pack===
Each push pack weighs about . Its contents include broad-spectrum oral and intravenous antibiotics, emergency medicines, IV fluids and kits, airway equipment, bandages, vaccines, antitoxins, and ventilators. The material deploys by unmarked trucks and airplanes within 12 hours of the receipt of a request by the CDC. The U.S. Marshals Service provides armed security from these federal sites to local destinations. The SNS has adequate vaccines and countermeasures in its stockpile, including 300 million smallpox treatment courses and enough anthrax vaccines to handle a three-city incident.

===CHEMPACK===
CHEMPACKs contain nerve agent antidotes to help in the event of a nerve agent attack or industrial accident. As of 2015, 1,960 CHEMPACKs were forward-deployed in more than 1,340 locations across each state and territory of the United States.

==History==

===Cold War era===

During the first decade of the Cold War, the United States accumulated a civil defense medical stockpile at 32 storage facilities. The supplies began to degrade in the 1960s, and were disposed of and the stockpile program closed in 1974.

===Clinton administration===

In April 1998, President Bill Clinton read the Richard Preston novel &quot;The Cobra Event&quot;, a fiction book about a mad scientist spreading a virus throughout New York City. As a result, Clinton held a meeting with scientists and cabinet officials to discuss the threat of bioterrorism. He was so impressed that he asked the experts to meet with senior-level aides at the Department of Defense and in the Department of Health and Human Services. At that time, the government had stockpiles of medications for military personnel, but did not have them for civilians. Shortly after, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Clinton surprised many in Washington at how fast he and his National Security Council had moved to change that. By October, Clinton signed into law a new budget of $51 million for pharmaceutical and vaccine stockpiling to be carried out by the CDC.

The US Congress appropriated funds for the CDC to create a pharmaceutical and vaccine stockpile to handle biological and chemical threats from disease that could affect large numbers of the US civilian population, in Public Law 105–277 dated October 21, 1998. The original name was the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile (NPS) program, but additional materials have been added to the stockpile since the original authorization .

===Bush administration===

The federal government implemented a pandemic blueprint for distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (P.P.E.) from the Strategic National Stockpile, in coordination with public and private efforts.

On March 1, 2003, the NPS was renamed the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) program with joint management by Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services.

In 2005 and in preparation for a predictable pandemic influenza, the Bush administration called for the coordination of domestic production and stockpiling of protective personal equipment. In 2006, the US Congress funded the integration of protective equipment to a Strategic National Stockpile: 52 million surgical masks and 104 million N95 air-filtration masks were acquired and added.

Public Health Emergency lists large-scale deployments from the SNS in response to emergencies.

The SNS successfully deployed 12-hour &quot;push packages&quot; to New York City and Washington, D.C., in response to the September 11 attacks, and managed inventory (MI) to numerous locations in response to the anthrax terrorist attacks of 2001.

Following the landfall of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf coast of Mississippi and Louisiana in September 2005, the CDC deployed SNS assets, technical assistance and response units, plus the newly developed and rapidly deployable &quot;federal medical contingency stations&quot; to state-approved locations near or in the disaster areas. The contingency stations, later renamed Federal Medical Stations (FMS), are caches of equipment and supplies provided by the SNS, set up in local &quot;buildings of opportunity&quot; and staffed by local or federal medical personnel to provide triage, low acuity care, and temporary holding of displaced patients for whom local acute care systems are damaged or destroyed.

===Obama administration===
Since the original deployment following Hurricane Katrina, FMSs have been deployed to support other major disaster responses including Superstorm Sandy. The FMS program is a collaboration between CDC and the Office of Emergency Management under the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. In 2014, responding to stakeholder feedback, a 50-bed FMS cache was developed and made available in addition to the original 250-bed FMS.

The SNS released one-quarter of its antiviral drug inventory (Tamiflu and Relenza), personal protective equipment (PPE), and respiratory protection devices, to help every US state respond to the H1N1 Influenza 2009 swine influenza outbreak in the United States.

After the 2009 flu pandemic in which tens of millions of masks were distributed, fiscal constraints imposed by the agency&#x27;s $600 million annual budget led officials to decide that replenishing a large inventory of N95 face masks was of less priority than stockpiling other equipment and drugs for diseases and disasters.

===First Trump administration===

During the first Trump administration, Trump falsely claimed his administration inherited an ‘empty’ stockpile from the previous administration.

From 2017 to 2019, the Trump administration failed to replace masks and other supplies used in earlier disasters. In May 2020, in a House subcommittee meeting, whistle-blower Dr. Rick Bright, previous director of Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, explained that the Trump administration had ignored his early warnings to stock up on masks and other supplies to combat the coronavirus.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) of the Department of Health and Human Services has managed the Strategic National Stockpile since October 1, 2018. Prior to that, the stockpile was managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

====2020 COVID-19 pandemic====
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SNS was involved in providing supplies to the repatriation efforts of State Department employees from China and Japan. It also shipped thousands of N95 masks to the states of Washington, Massachusetts, and New York to respond to their surging infection rates. In March 2020, SNS director Steven Adams said it had stockpiled 13 million masks and had placed an order for 500 million more by September 2021. The SNS was criticized for containing over 5 million expired masks.

On March 29, 2020, HHS accepted a donation of 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate from Sandoz and one million doses of Resochin (chloroquine phosphate) from Bayer Pharmaceuticals for use in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients or in clinical trials. The SNS will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to deliver the doses to states. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later withdrew Emergency Use Authorization for these drugs after studies found they had no benefit for treating COVID-19.

On April 1, 2020, Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters that the cache of personal protective equipment stored by the SNS was almost depleted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This was later confirmed by President Donald Trump. PPE from the SNS was sent directly to health facilities across the country.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, states criticized the lack of availability of medical supplies from the federal stockpile. At a White House press conference on April 2, 2020, senior advisor Jared Kushner commented &quot;The notion of the federal stockpile was it&#x27;s supposed to be our stockpile. It&#x27;s not supposed to be states&#x27; stockpiles that they then use.&quot; The idea that the stockpile was not a backup for states that run out of supplies was disputed by Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, among others.

The description of the stockpile, as listed on its website, was changed the day after Kushner&#x27;s remarks to better align with them, from:
&quot;Strategic National Stockpile is the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out. When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency. Organized for scalable response to a variety of public health threats, this repository contains enough supplies to respond to multiple large-scale emergencies simultaneously.&quot;
to: &quot;The Strategic National Stockpile&#x27;s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available.&quot;

Washington State announced on April 5, 2020, that it would return more than 400 ventilators it had received from the Stockpile &quot;... to help states facing higher numbers of COVID-19 cases.&quot;

On April 8, 2020, HHS contracted with DuPont for 2.25 million Tyvek suits to be delivered to the SNS to be used as PPE for frontline healthcare workers. By April 13, 2020, HHS used the Defense Production Act (DPA) to contract for ventilator production with General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire. Additionally, they contracted with Hamilton and Zoll for ventilator production without using the DPA. The seven contracts were expected to produce 137,431 ventilators by the end of 2020 at a total cost of $1.435 billion.

===Biden administration===
In January 2022, amidst a surge in cases caused by the more contagious Omicron variant, the CDC updated its guidance to emphasize the greater protection from wearing N95 masks in indoor public spaces. The Biden administration announced it would distribute 400 million N95 masks from the SNS which started arriving in late January and early February.

====2022 monkeypox outbreak====
The stockpile was again used during the 2022 monkeypox outbreak. In May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed the United States released some of their Jynneos monkeypox vaccine supply from their Strategic National Stockpile for people who are &quot;high-risk&quot;. On May 27, 2022, the CDC specified the indications for the Jynneos vaccine: research laboratory personnel, clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for orthopoxviruses, designated response team members, and health care personnel who administer live smallpox Vaccine or care for patients infected with orthopoxviruses.

==Criticism==

In March of 2021, the &quot;New York Times&quot; alleged mismanagement involving the Strategic National Stockpile, stating, &quot;In one telling example, The Times found, the government approved a plan in 2015 to buy tens of millions of N95 respirators — lifesaving equipment for medical workers that has been in short supply because of Covid-19 — but the masks repeatedly lost out in the competition for funding over the years leading up to the pandemic, according to five former federal health officials involved in the effort. During the same period, Emergent sold the government nearly $1 billion in anthrax vaccines, financial disclosures show.&quot;

==Related legislation==

Section 403 of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 307; 113th Congress) reauthorized the Strategic National Stockpile for FY2014-FY2018. It required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: 
# submit to the appropriate congressional committees, to the extent that the disclosure of such information does not compromise national security, the annual review of the contents of the Stockpile; and 
# review and revise the contents of the Stockpile to ensure that the potential depletion of countermeasures currently in the Stockpile is identified and appropriately addressed, including through necessary replenishment.

<text>The SEC filing is a financial statement or other formal document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public companies, certain insiders, and broker-dealers are required to make regular SEC filings. Investors and financial professionals rely on these filings for information about companies they are evaluating for investment purposes. Many, but not all SEC filings are available online through the SEC&#x27;s EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database and as structured datasets in the Harvard Dataverse.

==Common filing types==
The most commonly filed SEC forms are the 10-K and the 10-Q. These forms are composed of four main sections: The business section, the F-pages, the Risk Factors, and the MD&amp;A. The business section provides an overview of the Company. The F-pages contain the financial statements which are either audited or reviewed by an independent auditor. 

The Risk Factors contain a list of all of the potential risks that exist for the company. While the MD&amp;A contains a narrative about the financial results of the company. This narrative is also accompanied by management&#x27;s expectations for the upcoming year.
Other filings are required with respect to offerings by private companies.

==All filing types==
The filings accepted by the SEC as of November 2011.
===See also===
*Form 10-K405

== Form suffixes ==
==Finding forms==
All forms are filed with the SEC, and many can be found for free in the SEC&#x27;s EDGAR database. There are also several other portals that specialize in sorting information found in individual forms, such as the financial search engine, AlphaSense. And new platforms leveraging AI, like stockinsights.ai, are emerging to provide advanced features to navigate these filings.

Forms which are not found in EDGAR include the Form PF, which is used for private funds and is kept confidential per the Dodd–Frank Act.

<doc id="864510" wikidata="Q5360275" url="?curid=864510" title="York Park">
<text>York Park is a sports ground in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct, Launceston, Australia. Holding 21,000 people, York Park is known commercially as University of Tasmania (UTAS) Stadium and was formerly known as Aurora Stadium under a previous naming rights agreement signed with Aurora Energy in 2004. Primarily used for Australian rules football, its record attendance of 20,971 was set in June 2006, when Hawthorn Football Club played Richmond Football Club in an Australian Football League (AFL) match.

The area was swampland before becoming Launceston&#x27;s showgrounds in 1873. In the following decades the grounds were increasingly used for sports, including cricket, bowls and tennis. In 1919, plans were prepared for the transformation of the area into a multi-sports venue. From 1923, the venue was principally used for Australian rules football by the Northern Tasmanian Football Association, and for occasional inter-state games. Visiting mainland football clubs regularly played mid-season or end-of-season matches at the ground. Other sports such as cricket, tennis, bowling, cycling and foot-racing have been played at the venue.

Hawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year between 2003 and 2006. In 2007, the Tasmanian Government signed a $16.4 million, five-year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn, under which the club will play four regular season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match at the venue each year. The venue hosted its first VFL/AFL finals during the 2021 AFL finals series.

Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events, and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $23.6 million. On 21 February 2009 York Park became home to the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame.

== History ==
The area now known as York Park was originally &quot;swampy, sour, and choked with weeds&quot;. After European settlement, it was used for landfill before becoming the Launceston showgrounds in 1874. By 1881, of land (now York and Invermay Parks) had been taken over by the Launceston City Council &quot;for the purpose of recreation, health and enjoyment&quot;. The area was ready to be used for two cricket games by the end of 1886. Cricketers were full of praise for the ground, but because winter rain caused it to become waterlogged, footballers (Australian rules) were often unable to use the facility.

At a council meeting in July 1901, one member, Alderman Storrer, proposed that Inveresk Park be renamed York Park in honour of the Duke of York (later King George V), who visited Tasmania during the Federation celebrations of 1901. The proposal was passed 4–2, although another member, Alderman Sadler, noted that &quot;Launceston was well known as a loyal community and did not need to change the park&#x27;s name&quot; to prove their fidelity to the monarchy. A bowling green and tennis courts were completed by 1910, along with the main oval which was used for state school sports.
In 1919, the council held a competition for the design of the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators. Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921. A cycling track surrounding the perimeter fence was in use by September of the same year.
On 4 May 1923 &quot;The Examiner&quot; reported on that &quot;Work on the grandstand was completed for the opening of the 1923 football season, when the game was transferred from the NTCA Ground to York Park. Work on the grandstand and the seating round the oval has been proceeded with at top speed, and spectators at the game tomorrow should have little to complain of.&quot; The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9,441. A reporter from &quot;The Examiner&quot; commented: &quot;The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower.&quot; When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: &quot;they&#x27;d line up a whole group of people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we&#x27;d go along with a container alongside each other and we&#x27;d pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player.&quot;

Heavy floods in 1929 caused substantial damage to the ground, destroying the cycling track, which was subsequently rebuilt. In the 1930s the Launceston Football Club, who played regularly at the ground, won six consecutive premierships before World War II intervened. As a consequence of the war NTFA matches were cancelled after the 1941 season, not to resume until May 1945. Three years later, 12 ornamental trees were planted at the ground, in memory of NTFA players who had lost their lives in the war.

In 1960, York Park was the venue of a football match in which Tasmania defeated Victoria for the first time. The match was attended by a record crowd of approximately 15,000. Four years later, the southern stand (demolished in 2004) was completed. In the 1970s another stand was added, capable of holding 650 spectators and incorporating sales kiosks and committee rooms.
Up to 1999 York Park had remained a sports ground used predominately for local events, generally attracting modest crowds; according to ground manager Robert Groenewegen, supporters were able to &quot;park [their] car[s] next to the boundary fence&quot;.
However, before the 1998 federal election the local member of parliament (MP) representing the Division of Bass, Warwick Smith—a minister from the ruling Liberal Party—promised public funding for the redevelopment of York Park. Although Smith lost his seat, the Liberals retained power and kept the promise. The $6.4 million redevelopment completed in 2000 was the first major phase in the process of raising the ground to Australian Football League (AFL) standard. Work included the construction of the Gunns Stand, a two-level grandstand originally holding 2,500 (now extended to 5,700) which incorporates corporate facilities. Other improvements added were five television standard light towers, a watering and drainage system able to disperse up to of rain an hour, and 85 in-ground sprinklers capable of rising .

In 2003, the Government of Tasmania allocated $2 million to erect a roof above 6,000 terrace seats, in readiness for the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup; this meant that almost all of the seating area was protected from the weather. In 2004, the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six-year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy.
During 2006, the state government supplied $150,000 for new gates and ticket boxes at the stadium entry. The gates were later named after recently deceased Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon. These gates, and the heritage-listed Northern Stand, have been placed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register as culturally significant to the state. The two-storey Cameron-Tyson stand was in 2005, replaced by an extension of the Gunns Stand.
In March 2008, an arson attack destroyed part of the Northern Stand, causing between $300,000 and $500,000 damage. In December 2008 the Launceston City Council proposed a $7 million development for a replacement Northern Stand. The project includes the relocation of the old Northern Stand&#x27;s heritage roof into part of the redevelopment of facilities at Invermay Park. The old structure at York Park will be replaced with a 2,125-seat grandstand which will include three AFL compliant changerooms, an AFL umpire changeroom, a corporate facility for 936 people in corporate boxes, suites and function rooms, coaches boxes, along with statistician, timekeepers and print media rooms. Post-match press conference, drug testing, and radio rooms will also be included. The stand has increased the ground&#x27;s capacity to 21,000 and the seating capacity to 13,825. These works were designed by Tasmania-based architects Philp Lighton Architects. The Australian Government was expected to contribute $4 million, the Tasmanian Government $2 million and Launceston City Council $500,000. The Hawthorn Football Club are currently asking for a &quot;sizeable&quot; contribution from the AFL towards the development, and Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has indicated that a contribution of $1 million was possible.

On 22 October 2016, the University of Tasmania bought the naming rights to the stadium for a five-year contract that would take effect on 1 January as the university campus would sit next to York Park, bringing an end to a 13-year partnership with Aurora Energy.

In March 2022 Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein announced the government intended to expand the seating capacity of the stadium to 27,500 and install retractable seating for rectangular sports. The development will occur within the following five years, provided the state government&#x27;s $65 million contribution is matched by the federal government and the stadium&#x27;s ownership is transferred from the Launceston City Council to the state government-run Stadiums Tasmania agency.

== Sports and events ==
=== Australian rules football ===
Australian rules football is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, it was estimated that the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1 million and $1.5 million into the Tasmanian economy.

The number of AFL matches peaked in 2006, when Hawthorn played three home games and one pre-season game, while St Kilda played two home games. The games drew an average crowd of 17,108, with a record attendance of 20,971 for the match between Hawthorn and Richmond.

Controversy occurred at York Park when, in a game between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was too quiet to be heard by any of the umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium&#x27;s sirens were replaced, and the old ones were put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.

In 2007 York Park benefitted from a five-year, $16.4 million sponsorship of Hawthorn by the state government. Under the sponsorship agreement the stadium is the venue for five of Hawthorn&#x27;s matches each year—one pre-season and four premiership games. Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett has expressed interest in his club playing higher profile teams, such as Collingwood, at the stadium.

As well as being an AFL venue, York Park is the long-term base of North Launceston, and thus hosts regular Tasmanian State League matches. The ground also hosted occasional Tasmanian Devils Football Club home games in the Victorian Football League, from 2001 until the club&#x27;s demise in 2008.

In 2021, due to COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns preventing matches from being played in Melbourne and Sydney, York Park hosted its first two AFL finals matches: both first-week elimination finals, the first a victory over , and the second a Greater Western Sydney Giants win over the Sydney Swans in Sydney Derby XXII.

=== Other uses ===
York Park hosted its first international sporting fixture in the group phase of the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup, when Romania and Namibia played in front of 15,457 spectators. As a soccer venue the stadium has hosted one National Soccer League match and three A-League pre-season games. Melbourne Knights and Perth Glory played a national league match at the stadium during the 2001–02 NSL season. In July 2006, after the A-League replaced the NSL, the stadium hosted Tasmania&#x27;s first A-League match when Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United played in the pre-season competition. In 2007, 8,061 attended the corresponding match, which has since become a regular fixture. In addition to pre-season matches, Aurora Stadium has also hosted regular season A-League matches: on 1 February 2012, Melbourne Victory played Gold Coast United FC in a regular season A-League game in front of a crowd of 5,268 people and on 12 January 2013, Melbourne Victory played against Central Coast Mariners in front of a crowd of 6,238 people. Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has stated that ground authorities are attempting to win hosting rights for Australian national soccer team matches. On 30 December 2017, the ground played host to its first ever Big Bash League match when the Hobart Hurricanes took a home game to York Park with the Sydney Thunder being their opponents. The Thunder won by 57 runs in front of 16,734 fans.
Western United FC has also played home games at the stadium.

Among non-sporting events, before its redevelopment the stadium hosted an Ike &amp; Tina Turner concert and a Billy Graham religious revival meeting. The Crusty Demons performed at the stadium during 2006 and March 2008.
Elton John performed at York Park during his &quot;Rocket Man: Greatest Hits Live&quot; Tour at the end of 2007; this remains his only appearance in Tasmania as of August 2009.

== Structures and facilities ==

York Park is an oval-shaped grassed arena surrounded by several different stands, the largest being the two-tier Gunns Stand on the ground&#x27;s western side. The stand originally had a capacity of 2,500, which was increased by an extension in 2005 to 5,700.
The stand has two corporate box areas, the Gunns Function Centre and the Corporate Function Centre.
Immediately north of the Stand is the Aurora Function Centre, which also houses coaches&#x27; boxes,
and is next to the heritage listed Northern Stand connecting the Northern, Southern and Eastern Terraces. The stands have a collective capacity of 6,000, bringing the ground&#x27;s total seating to 11,700.
The Railway Workers Hill is a small, uncovered stand located at the eastern side of the ground between the Northern and Eastern Terraces. The ground has a parking capacity of approximately 2,500, from the use of large grassy areas at the adjacent Inveresk site, with an option of street parking.

York Park has often been criticised for its large playing surface, which is blamed for producing unattractive low-scoring football. Prior to the start of 2009, only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points. For a pre-season match in 2009, 13 metres of width was removed from the outer wing &quot;in a bid to produce more attractive games.&quot; Before the match, Groenewegen said, &quot;Because that outer wing was so wide, once they [a team] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back because you were so far away from the goals.&quot; The ground is also known for its strong wind, which hinders the accuracy of long-distance kicks that are propelled high into the air.

A grant of $50,000 from the Tasmanian Community Fund in 2005 helped the Launceston City Council and AFL Tasmania construct a permanent Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame at York Park. The ground was chosen as the site because it is regarded as the home of Australian rules football in Tasmania. AFL Tasmania initiated the Hall of Fame nomination process, and since 2005 various clubs, players and grounds have been inducted. The Hall of Fame opened to the public on 21 February 2009. As of May 2009, $23.6 million had been spent re-developing the stadium.

== Crowds ==

The ground&#x27;s record attendance is 20,971, at an AFL match between Hawthorn and Richmond on 18 June 2006. This match occurred before the Northern Stand was damaged and the stadium&#x27;s capacity reduced. An AFL match between Hawthorn and St Kilda on 8 August 2009 saw a capacity crowd of 20,011, the largest crowd since the fire. The stadium&#x27;s lowest AFL attendance is 9,007 for the match between Hawthorn and on 23 June 2018.

The highest recorded attendance for an interstate match at York Park is 15,000 for the 1960 clash between Tasmania and Victoria.

The highest recorded attendance for a Tasmanian Football League match at York Park is 6,755 for the 1989 Second Semi Final played between North Launceston and North Hobart on 2 September 1989.

The highest recorded attendance for a soccer match is 8,061, when Melbourne Victory played Adelaide United on 16 July during a 2007 A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup match. The Billy Graham religious revival meeting on 17 March 1959 attracted 17,000 attendees, a record for a non-sporting event at the ground.

<text>This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb was a folk punk band from Pensacola, Florida, United States. Their first recording was released in 1997 on Ghostmeat Records. Their later releases have been on Plan It X Records and No Idea Records, but now appear on their own label Plan-It X South. This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb initially started as a new wave band, with folk singer David Dondero on drums. They quickly switched to playing country music, but their punk roots were evident enough in their music that they became one of the premiere bands at the forefront of the folk-punk genre. They did several US tours, including an Alaska tour 2003 played at Geekfest, and toured Europe.

On February 3, 2011, This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb announced that it was ending. Rymodee and Terry still write and play together in Zippers To Nowhere, based in Chattanooga.

Much of their music is politically oriented. This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb is staunchly pacifist and concerned with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and racial equality in general.

== Controversy over name ==
On March 2, 2006, at 5:30 am an Ohio University police officer spotted a bicycle attached to the Oasis restaurant bearing a promotional sticker for the band. The officer saw the words &quot;This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb&quot; and became concerned. The area was cordoned off, and part of the campus was closed for several hours. The bicycle was subsequently destroyed by the Athens bomb squad despite assurances from the bike&#x27;s owner that it was just a sticker. The owner, a graduate student, was initially charged with inducing panic, a misdemeanor. However, the charges were dropped a few days later. Later the student was awarded money for the damages to his bicycle. 
A similar incident occurred in 2001, when a police officer spotted and detained a woman at an Austin, Texas peace rally. Her bicycle was also labeled with the band&#x27;s sticker. The woman was released after the band&#x27;s existence was confirmed.

On March 14, 2006, Bellarmine Hall at Saint Joseph&#x27;s University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was evacuated because of another bicycle with the band&#x27;s name painted on it. No charges were filed.

On February 16, 2009, Terminal C at Memphis International Airport was evacuated because of a bicycle with the band&#x27;s sticker on it. A pilot notified police when he saw the bike, with the band&#x27;s sticker on it, parked outside of the terminal. Police evacuated the terminal and sent in K9 units; however, no explosive materials were found. Police arrested the owner of the bike but let the owner go a few hours later because he had not committed a crime. After hearing about the incident, the band&#x27;s lead singer urged fans to use caution when they applied the stickers.

<doc id="864522" wikidata="Q1000809" url="?curid=864522" title="Buddha in art">
<text>Much Buddhist art uses depictions of the historical Buddha, Gautama Buddha, which are known as  () in Sanskrit and Pali. These may be statues or other images such as paintings. The main figure in an image may be someone else who has obtained Buddhahood, or a boddhisattva, especially in the various traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. Other Buddhas and bodhisattvas in art have become increasingly common over the centuries, perhaps now outnumbering images of the historical Buddha.

In its first centuries Buddhism was largely or entirely aniconic, not showing the person of Buddha except by symbols and relics. This changed, and figures of the Buddha became very common in the art of Gandhara and Gupta art. As forms of esoteric Buddhism developed, other figures from the expanding array of Buddhist sacred persons became more prominent. In Theravada Buddhism this was much less the case, and figures of the historical Buddha remain the most common main images in temples and shrines to the present.

Early images were most often of Buddha standing, but seated meditating postures, essentially the lotus position of yoga, came to predominate. Often these represent a specific moment in the Buddha&#x27;s life, which is identified by the Buddha&#x27;s hand gesture (&quot;mudra&quot;), or attributes shown. There are also statues of the Reclining Buddha, lying down, usually showing the moment of his death. 

Sets of narrative scenes from the life of the Buddha tend to concentrate on standard groupings such as the Eight Great Events or other sets, but may be much larger. Originally common in reliefs, and probably paintings of which few have survived, they have more recently mostly been in painted form. Narrative scenes may show the Buddha in various poses, though they tend to show the Buddha in the same standing, seated or lying positions, with other figures or a &quot;mudra&quot; indicating what moment is being depicted. 

==Commonalities==
Despite cultural and regional differences in the interpretations of texts about the life of Gautama Buddha, there are some general guidelines to the attributes of a Buddharupa:

* Fingers and toes are elongated proportionately
* Long, aquiline nose
* Elongated earlobes
* Head protuberance
* Broad shoulders

The elongated earlobes are vestiges of his life as a prince, when he wore extravagant jewelry. The bump at the top of the head is the ushnisha and represents spirituality, wisdom, and awakening.

==Regional variations==
Depictions of the Buddha vary widely across cultures.

===Proportions===
The image of Buddhas started to emerge from the first century CE in North India, developed in Gandhara and Mathura. The art of Gandhara was influenced by Ancient Greek art, leading to the development of Greco-Buddhist art with anatomically well-proportioned and realistic figure of the Buddha. One of the most influential Buddhist art was Gupta art and the later Amaravati style. From India the depiction of Buddha spread to the rest of Asia. The Buddharupas of India, Sri Lanka, Javanese Sailendra and Cambodian art usually depict a well-proportioned figure, but sometimes he is shown emaciated, in recollection of the Buddha&#x27;s years of ascetic practices.

Many people may be familiar with the &quot;Happy&quot; or &quot;Laughing&quot; Buddha, a different historical figure, who should not be confused with the images of Gautama Buddha. Budai, a Chinese Buddhist monk also known as &quot;Hotei&quot;, is depicted as fat and happy, almost always shown smiling or laughing, and is associated with Maitreya, the future Buddha.

===Postures, gestures and artifacts===
A statue or a painting of Buddha always illustrates a mudra or gesture. There are large numbers of these, but a few are the oldest and most common. In Mahayana Buddhism, some of the most common have also become identified with the five transcendental Buddhas, also called &quot;Dhyani Buddhas&quot; or &quot;Pancha Buddhas&quot;, further complicating identification of the figure shown. These mudras are as follows:

* Dharmachakra Buddha Mudra – Vairochana: Dharmachakra mudra has two hands held against the chest with the tips of the thumbs and forefingers of each hand united. This mudra represents a gesture of teaching.
* Bhumisparsa Buddha Mudra – Akshobhya: This gesture, &quot;touching the earth&quot; (Bhumisparsa) mudra, became Buddha Akshobhya&#x27;s mudra. The Buddha called upon mother earth to bear witness to his attainment of Enlightenment. To indicate this, he touched the earth with his right hand as witness to his perfection. This mudra is related to the Maravijaya attitude.
* Varada Buddha Mudra – Ratna Sambhava: In this mudra right hand lies open near his right knee. His left hand is seen holding an alms bowl. In Sanskrit, Varada means &quot;granting a boon&quot;. The gesture shows the right palm turned towards the receiver of boons, with the fingers pointed downwards.
* Dhyana Buddha Mudra – Amitabha Buddha: This mudra has the left hand resting on the lap with the palm facing upwards, the right hand on the top of the left one (also with its palm facing upwards), and the two thumbs touching each other. Sometimes a bowl is placed above his palms. Here the meditating hand gesture represents a state of deep meditation and the unity of wisdom and compassion.
* Abhaya Buddha Mudra – Amoghsiddhi: Abhaya mudra represents the hand gesture of fearlessness and protection. The gesture of fearlessness and protection, usually shown as the left hand with palm turned outward and all fingers extended upwards. The symbolic meaning of the dispelling fear pose is an interpretation of the action of preaching. It is said that one gains fearlessness by following the Bodhisattva path.

Images of Buddha showing him reclining, represent his &quot;Parinirvana&quot; or departure into final nirvana at death.

Other times he is holding various symbolic objects, or making symbolic mudras (gestures).

The clothing also varies with national styles. In East Asia it tends to follow local monastic dress, with the arms covered. In India early depictions, especially from hotter regions, such as art of Mathura, Buddha is often shown with very thin robes or topless, with most of the body uncovered, or appearing so.

<text>Tearaght Island or Inishtearaght (, meaning &quot;the westerly&quot;) is an uninhabited steep rocky island west of the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland.

== Geography ==
At longitude 10° 39.7&#x27; Tearaght is the westernmost of the Blasket Islands, and thus the westernmost island of Ireland. It is also one of the westernmost points in Europe after Iceland, and Azores. However, there are some exposed rocks further west: Tearaght Rocks, Tearaght Rocks West (10° 41.0&#x27;), and Foze Rocks (10° 41.3&#x27;).

An Tiaracht is about a kilometre from east to west, and from north to south. The island is divided into two sections, a larger eastern part ( high) and a western part that rises to . A narrow neck of rock, with a natural tunnel through it, joins the two parts.

==Demographics==
== Nature ==
Like the other Blasket Islands, Tiaracht holds large numbers of seabirds, with internationally important populations of Manx shearwater and European storm-petrel. Leach&#x27;s storm-petrels have also been found there (but not proved to be breeding) in recent years. The number of auks, especially puffins, has apparently fluctuated greatly, though early records are not always reliable.

== Inishtearaght Lighthouse ==
A lighthouse was established on the island in 1870, and automated in 1988. The lighthouse, maintained by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, has a tower high and the focal height is at above sea level, it has a range of . The light was served by the steepest funicular rail track in Europe from 1913 until automation.

<text>Janet Corinne Brown (born June 23, 1947) is a former Canadian politician. She was first elected as a member of Parliament under the Reform Party of Canada ticket in the Alberta riding of Calgary Southeast in the 1993 federal election. Before entering politics, Brown was a schoolteacher and then agribusiness executive. She is of Croatian descent.

Brown rose to prominence as a well-spoken and moderate member of the Reform Party, becoming Canadian Heritage Critic in its shadow cabinet when it was second Opposition in the 35th Canadian Parliament. She and Stephen Harper were the only two MPs to speak out against the motion to deny same-sex couples the same rights as heterosexual ones at the 1994 Reform convention. She won much admiration for putting a yellow rose on the empty desk of rival Bloc Québécois party leader Lucien Bouchard, who was suffering from a life-threatening illness. The image of the solitary rose on his empty desk was broadcast around the nation. Brown was curious about gender roles within Canadian politics and subsequently wrote an article on the subject.

Later that year she was voted sexiest, best-dressed, and most generous MP by the &quot;Hill Times&quot; newspaper. Due to her success in questioning Canadian Heritage Minister Michel Dupuy, she was promoted to critic for Human Resources Development Canada.

Early in 1996, however, Brown, along with fellow Reform MP Jim Silye, spoke out openly against the right wing of the party. The remarks were motivated by Art Hanger&#x27;s planned trip to Singapore to look into the success of caning at deterring crime. While the party leaders acknowledged that Brown and Silye&#x27;s criticism had weight, they were attacked for publicly criticizing the party. Brown promised to deal with any future concerns within the party, and both she and Silye apologized. The next month, however, Reform MP Bob Ringma mentioned that store owners should be free to move gays and &quot;ethnics&quot; &quot;to the back of the shop&quot;, or even to fire them, if it helped their business. A few days later MP David Chatters aroused more controversy when he suggested it would be reasonable to ban homosexuals from teaching children. Party leader Preston Manning and the other top party officials did not censure the remarks or demand apologies from the MPs.

On May 7, 1996, the Reform executive voted to suspend Ringma and Chatters for their remarks but also voted to suspend Brown for speaking out against the party. Brown was disappointed and three days later announced she was quitting the party to sit as an independent. She was especially critical of Preston Manning and how he managed the party.

Brown remained an independent for the rest of the parliament but co-operated closely with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In the 1997 election, she ran as a Progressive Conservative, moving to contest the adjacent riding of Calgary Southwest, then represented by Reform leader Preston Manning.

Despite drawing much attention in the sometimes bitter campaign against her former party leader, Brown lost by a significant margin, and retired permanently from politics. In 2005, she completed a Ph.D. in education and women&#x27;s studies. She became a lifelong learning consultant and retired in 2013.

<text>Nuorgam () is a village in the Utsjoki municipality in the region of Lapland, Finland. It has approximately 200 inhabitants. It is the northernmost point of Finland and the northernmost point of the European Union. It is situated on the Deatnu river (, ), which is very popular for salmon fishing.

The Finnish WWII action film &quot;Sisu&quot;, directed by Jalmari Helander, was mainly filmed in Nuorgam in 2021.

== History ==
The origin of the name &quot;Njuorggán&quot; is unclear. &quot;Nuorgam&quot; is a Finnish adaptation of the original Northern Sámi name.

The first settler in the area originated from Buolbmát in Norway, arriving in the area in the late 18th century. The surname &quot;Nuorgam&quot;, used since the 1770s (&quot;Niorkam&quot;), originates from the village.

<doc id="864551" wikidata="Q895314" url="?curid=864551" title="French battleship Bouvet">
<text>Bouvet was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy that was built in the 1890s. She was a member of a group of five broadly similar battleships, along with , , , and , which were ordered in response to the British . &quot;Bouvet&quot; was the last vessel of the group to be built, and her design was based on that of &quot;Charles Martel&quot;. Like her half-sisters, she was armed with a main battery of two guns and two guns in individual turrets. She had a top speed of , which made her one of the fastest battleships in the world at the time. &quot;Bouvet&quot; proved to be the most successful design of the five, and she was used as the basis for the subsequent . Nevertheless, she suffered from design flaws that reduced her stability and contributed to her loss in 1915.

&quot;Bouvet&quot; spent the majority of her peacetime career in the Mediterranean Squadron conducting routine training exercises. This period was relatively uneventful, though she was involved in a collision with the battleship in 1903 that saw both ships&#x27; captains relieved of command. In 1906, she assisted in the response to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Italy. &quot;Bouvet&quot; was withdrawn from front-line service in 1907 and thereafter used as part of the training fleet. The ship was the only vessel of her group of five half-sisters still in service at the outbreak of World War I in July 1914.

A significant portion of the French Army was stationed in French North Africa, so at the start of the war, &quot;Bouvet&quot; and much of the rest of the fleet were used to escort troop convoys across to southern France. With this work done by late August, &quot;Bouvet&quot; and several other battleships were used to patrol for contraband shipments in the central Mediterranean. From November to late December, she was stationed as a guard ship at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal. The ship thereafter joined the naval operations off the Dardanelles, where she participated in a series of attacks on the Ottoman fortifications guarding the straits. These culminated in a major assault on 18 March 1915; during the attack, she was hit approximately eight times by shellfire but was not seriously damaged. While turning to withdraw, however, she struck a mine and sank within two minutes; only 75 men were rescued from a complement of 718. Two British battleships were also sunk by mines that day, and the disaster convinced the Allies to abandon the naval campaign in favor of an amphibious assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula.

==Design==
In 1889, the British Parliament passed the Naval Defence Act that resulted in the construction of the eight s; this major expansion of naval power led the French government to pass its reply, the (Naval Law) of 1890. The law called for a total of twenty-four &quot;&quot; (squadron battleships) and a host of other vessels, including coastal defense battleships, cruisers, and torpedo boats. The first stage of the program was to be a group of four squadron battleships that were built to different designs but met the same basic characteristics, including armor, armament, and displacement. The naval high command issued the basic requirements on 24 December 1889; displacement would not exceed , the primary armament was to consist of and guns, the belt armor should be thick, and the ships should maintain a top speed of . The secondary battery was to be either or caliber, with as many guns fitted as space would allow. The general similarity of the ships led some observers to group them together as a ship class, though the authors of &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; point out that the vessels had &quot;sufficient differences to prevent them from being considered as one class.&quot;

The basic design for the ships was based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. Although the navy had stipulated that displacement could be up to 14,000 t, political considerations, namely parliamentary objections to increases in naval expenditures, led the designers to limit displacement to around . Five naval architects submitted proposals to the competition; Charles Ernest Huin prepared the design for &quot;Bouvet&quot;. He had also designed her half-sister , upon which the design for &quot;Bouvet&quot; was based. Before work on &quot;Charles Martel&quot; had begun, the naval command asked Huin to design an improved version. He completed the plans for the ship, which was slightly larger than her half-sisters, on 20 May, and the Navy awarded the contract for the ship on 8 October 1892.

&quot;Bouvet&quot; proved to be the most successful of the five ships, and she was the only one still in active service at the outbreak of World War I. She also provided the basis for the next class of French battleships, the three s built in the mid-1890s. She and her half-sisters nevertheless were disappointments in service; &quot;Bouvet&quot; suffered from stability problems that ultimately contributed to her loss in 1915, and all five of the vessels compared poorly to their British counterparts, particularly their contemporaries of the . The ships suffered from a lack of uniformity of equipment, which made them hard to maintain in service, and their mixed gun batteries comprising several calibers made gunnery in combat conditions difficult, since shell splashes were hard to differentiate. Many of the problems that plagued the ships in service were a result of the limitation on their displacement, particularly their stability and seakeeping.

===General characteristics and machinery===

&quot;Bouvet&quot; was long between perpendiculars, long at the waterline, and long overall. She had a beam of and an average draft of . She had a displacement of as designed. Unlike her half-sisters, which had a cut down quarterdeck, &quot;Bouvet&quot; retained a full flush deck. Her superstructure was reduced in size compared to her half-sisters, and she had a pair of short military masts; these changes were made to reduce the top-heaviness experienced with the earlier vessels. She kept the pronounced tumblehome to give the 27 cm guns wide fields of fire. &quot;Bouvet&quot; had a standard crew of 31 officers and 591 enlisted men, though as a flagship her crew grew to 41 officers and 651 enlisted men.

She had three vertical triple-expansion steam engines each driving a single three-bladed screw; the outboard screws were wide, while the center shaft was slightly smaller, at in diameter. The engines were powered with steam supplied by thirty-two Belleville water-tube boilers that were license-built by Indret. The boilers were divided into four boiler rooms, which were placed in two pairs on either end of the magazines for the wing turrets, and divided by a central bulkhead. The boilers were ducted into a pair of funnels. Her three engines were placed side by side and also divided by longitudinal bulkheads.

Her propulsion system was rated at , which allowed the ship to steam at a maximum speed of on speed trials with a light loading, though while on a 24-hour test using normal displacement, she cruised at . Using forced draft, she reached from during the tests. &quot;Bouvet&quot; was fast by the standards of the day; the only British battleship that approached her in speed was the second-class battleship . As built, &quot;Bouvet&quot; could carry of coal, though additional space allowed for up to in total. At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for .

The ship&#x27;s electrical system consisted of four 400-ampere/80-volt dynamos that had a combined output of . The dynamos were placed on the platform deck between the ducting for the boilers. Several smaller electric motors, rated at , powered the ship&#x27;s ventilation system, and motors drove the ash hoists for the boiler rooms. &quot;Bouvet&quot; was fitted with six searchlights: four on the battery deck (two amidships and one each forward and aft) and the remaining two on the masts.

===Armament===

&quot;Bouvet&quot;″s main armament consisted of two Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft and two Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two single-gun turrets, one amidships on each side, sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship&#x27;s sides. Both types of guns were experimental 45 caliber variants of the guns fitted in her half-sister . The 305 mm guns had a muzzle velocity of , which allowed the shells to penetrate up to of iron armor at a range of . This was sufficiently powerful to allow &quot;Bouvet&quot;″s main guns to easily penetrate the armor of most contemporary battleships at the common battle ranges of the day. The 274 mm guns, which were also 45 calibers long, had the same muzzle velocity, but being significantly smaller than the 305 mm guns, produced of iron penetration. The gun turrets were hydraulically operated and required the guns to be depressed to −4° to be loaded. They both had a rate of fire of one shell per minute. Both types of mounts allowed elevation to 14°; for the 305 mm guns, this produced a maximum range of , and for the 274 mm guns, their maximum range was .

Her secondary armament consisted of eight Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1891 naval guns, which were mounted in single turrets in the hull; two were placed just aft of the forward 305 mm turret, four were placed on either sides of the 274 mm guns, and the remaining two were just aft of the rear 305 mm turret. These guns had a firing rate of 4 rounds per minute, with a maximum range of from up to 20° elevation. For defense against torpedo boats, &quot;Bouvet&quot; carried eight  quick-firing (QF) guns in individual pedestal mounts with gun shields on the upper deck. Four were located between the funnels, two were placed abreast of the forward bridge, and the remaining two were similarly arranged on either side of the aft bridge. They had a rate of fire of between 7 and 15 shots per minute and they could engage targets out to . She also had twelve 3-pounder guns, and eight 1-pounder guns, all in individual mounts. Of the 37 mm guns, three were five-barreled Hotchkiss revolver cannon and the remaining five were single-barrel QF guns. Four of the 47 mm guns were mounted on the lower platforms of the military masts and the remainder, along with the 37 mm guns, were distributed along the length of the superstructure.

As was customary for capital ships of the period, her armament suite was rounded out by four torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull; both were located on the broadside close to the bow; they were aimed directly perpendicular to the centerline. The other two tubes were mounted above water, in trainable launchers placed amidships. The fire of these tubes was directed either by armored sights located abreast of the conning tower or unprotected sights on the battery deck. &quot;Bouvet&quot; carried a total of ten torpedoes of the Modèle 1892 Toulon/Fiume type; six were allocated to the submerged tubes, with the other four for the deck launchers. &quot;Bouvet&quot; also carried twenty Modèle 1892 naval mines that could be laid by the ship&#x27;s pinnaces.

====Fire control====
In the early 1890s, before &quot;Bouvet&quot; had begun construction, the French Navy introduced a fire-control system that included rangefinders, observers in the masts, and electric order transmitters to communicate fire control instructions from the control center to the gun crews. &quot;Bouvet&quot; was the first battleship completed with the system; for the purposes of fire control, her gun battery was divided into either individual sections (the large and medium-caliber guns) or groups of two or more guns (the 100 mm, 47 mm, and 37 mm guns). All of the guns were controlled by the () that was located directly below the conning tower, below the armored deck. The central command post received the range and bearing information from the rangefinders and calculated firing solutions, which would then be sent via the electric order transmitters to direct the fire of individual guns or sections.

===Armor===
The ship&#x27;s armor was constructed with nickel steel manufactured by several firms, including Schneider-Creusot, Saint-Chamond, and Châtillon &amp; Commentry, which allowed the design staff to reduce the thickness of the steel without compromising its effectiveness. Thus, weight could be saved that could be used elsewhere in the displacement-limited ships. The main belt was thick amidships, and tapered down to at the lower edge. Forward of the central citadel, the belt was reduced to (also reduced to 200 mm on the lower edge) and aft of the citadel, it tapered to (reduced to on the bottom edge). The belt extended for the entire length of the hull, and it was backed with 200 mm of teak. Above the belt was thick strake of side armor that created a highly subdivided cofferdam to reduce the risk of flooding from battle damage. The side of the cofferdam was reinforced by two layers of plating. &quot;Bouvet&quot;″s main deck was protected with of mild steel, back with two layers of 10 mm plating. Mild steel was used here, as the deck was designed to bend rather than shatter when struck by an armor-piercing shell at an oblique angle. The lower platform deck was thick, with a single layer of 10 mm plating behind it; it was intended to catch splinters that penetrated the main deck.

The main battery guns (both the 305 mm and 274 mm guns) were protected with of cemented armor on the faces and sides, with thick roofs and thick floors. Both the floors and roofs were composed of mild steel. The turrets sat atop barbettes with thick sides. The 138 mm turrets had thick sides and faces, with roofs and floors. Gun shields that were thick protected the 100 mm guns. The conning tower had thick sides, a 20 mm thick roof, and a thick floor. The uptakes for the boilers were protected with coamings that were 300 mm thick.

The ship&#x27;s armor layout was not as effective as the designers had hoped; at the designed displacement, the belt armor was submerged with just a 3° heel, and training all of the main battery turrets to one side would produce a heel of 2°. Incremental increases in weight during the construction process, which Huin was unable to supervise, left little margin for the belt to remain above the water. These increases forced compromises elsewhere in the ship&#x27;s armor protection, most notably the barbettes, which were criticized at the time; nothing could be done, however, due to the strict limit placed on displacement. The cofferdam also proved to be highly susceptible to uncontrollable flooding, which would have serious effects on the vessel&#x27;s stability.

==Service history==

&quot;Bouvet&quot; was laid down at the French Navy shipyard in Lorient on 16 January 1893, and was launched on 27 April 1896. After completing fitting-out work, she began sea trials on 5 March 1898. The ship was intended to have conducted her trials from Brest, but she was sent to Toulon to reinforce the Mediterranean Squadron due to the Fashoda crisis with Britain. She was commissioned into the French Navy in June 1898. The ship was named in honor of Admiral François Joseph Bouvet.

Throughout the ship&#x27;s peacetime career, she was occupied with routine training exercises that included gunnery training, combined maneuvers with torpedo boats and submarines, and practicing attacking coastal fortifications. Since &quot;Bouvet&quot; was one of the most modern French battleships in the late 1890s and early 1900s, she spent this time in the Mediterranean Squadron, France&#x27;s primary fleet. One of the largest of these exercises was conducted between March and July 1900, and involved the Mediterranean Squadron and the Northern Squadron. On 6 March, &quot;Bouvet&quot; joined the battleships &quot;Brennus&quot;, , , &quot;Charles Martel&quot;, and and four protected cruisers for maneuvers off Golfe-Juan on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, including night firing training. Over the course of April, the ships visited numerous French ports along the Mediterranean coast, and on 31 May the fleet steamed to Corsica for a visit that lasted until 8 June. After completing its own exercises in the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean Squadron rendezvoused with the Northern Squadron off Lisbon, Portugal, in late June before proceeding to Quiberon Bay for joint maneuvers in July. The maneuvers concluded with a naval review in Cherbourg on 19 July for President Émile Loubet. On 1 August, the Mediterranean Fleet departed for Toulon, arriving on 14 August.

&quot;Bouvet&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Battle Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, along with &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; and the new battleship , the latter becoming the divisional flagship. &quot;Bouvet&quot; departed Toulon on 29 January 1903 in company with the battleships , &quot;Gaulois&quot;, and &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, four cruisers, and accompanying destroyers for gunnery training off Golfe-Juan. At the time, &quot;Bouvet&quot; and &quot;Gaulois&quot; were the 2nd Division, with &quot;Bouvet&quot; in the lead; the other two ships formed the 1st Division. Two days later, when the divisions were ordered to change from two columns to a single line ahead for shooting drills, &quot;Bouvet&quot; failed to take her prescribed position and instead turned too closely to &quot;Gaulois&quot;. The latter accidentally struck the former, with &quot;Bouvet&quot; losing a ladder and incurring damage to one of the deck-mounted torpedo tubes. &quot;Gaulois&quot; had two armor plates torn from her bow. Both ships&#x27; captains were relieved of command over the incident. In October, &quot;Bouvet&quot; and the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron battleships steamed to Palma de Mallorca, and on their return to Toulon they conducted training exercises.

The year 1904 saw the Mediterranean Squadron visit Souda Bay in Crete, Beirut, Smyrna, and Salonika in the Ottoman Empire, Messina in Sicily, and Piraeus, Greece, during a cruise of the eastern Mediterranean in the middle of the year. The following year passed uneventfully for &quot;Bouvet&quot;, and on 10 April 1906, she, &quot;Iéna&quot;, and &quot;Gaulois&quot; were sent to Italy in the aftermath of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The three ships carried some 9,000 rations and their crews assisted the victims to recover from the disaster. The division returned to France in time for a naval review on 16 September held in Marseilles that included detachments from Britain, Spain, and Italy. &quot;Bouvet&quot; and the other French ships then returned to Toulon. The following year, in January 1907, &quot;Bouvet&quot; was withdrawn from front-line service with the Mediterranean Squadron. Now part of the Second Squadron, she was retained on active service for the year, but with a reduced crew. In July 1908, the Mediterranean Fleet was reorganized and &quot;Bouvet&quot; was attached to the 3rd Battleship Division as its flagship, under the command of () Laurent Marin-Darbel, along with &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; and the battleship .

Beginning in January 1909, with the commissioning of the six and s, the Mediterranean Squadron was reorganized into two battle squadrons; &quot;Bouvet&quot; was at that time assigned to the 3rd Division, part of the 2nd Battle Squadron, still the flagship of Marin-Darbel. Her place was taken the following year by &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, and she remained out of service that year, with the exception of during the fleet maneuvers conducted in June, which she joined. In January 1911, she returned to service as the flagship of Adam in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. On 5 October, the fleet was again reorganized and her place in what was now the 3rd Battle Squadron was taken by &quot;Charles Martel&quot;. On 16 October 1912, &quot;Bouvet&quot;, &quot;Gaulois&quot;, &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, &quot;Carnot&quot;, &quot;Masséna&quot;, and &quot;Jauréguiberry&quot; were activated for training duties as the 3rd Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron; in July 1913, they were joined by &quot;Charlemagne&quot;. The squadron was dissolved on 11 November, and &quot;Bouvet&quot;, &quot;Saint Louis&quot;, and &quot;Gaulois&quot; were assigned to the (). Training activities continued into 1914, and in March, the division joined the rest of the Mediterranean Squadron, which was now re-designated as the () for gunnery training off Corsica. Additional maneuvers were conducted beginning on 13 May, during which the fleet visited Bizerte in French Tunisia, Algiers in French Algeria, and Ajaccio, Corsica.

===World War I===
Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, France announced general mobilization on 1 August. The next day, Admiral Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère ordered the entire French fleet to begin raising steam at 22:15 so the ships could sortie early the following morning. The bulk of the fleet, including the (designated as &quot;Group C&quot;), was sent to French North Africa, where they would escort the vital troop convoys carrying elements of the French Army from North Africa back to France to counter the expected German invasion. At the time, the division was commanded by Émile Paul Amable Guépratte, and it was tasked with guarding against a possible attack by the German battlecruiser , which instead fled to the Ottoman Empire. &quot;Bouvet&quot; and her division mates steamed first to Algiers and then Oran. There, they rendezvoused with one of the convoys and covered its voyage north to Sète on 6 August. From there, &quot;Bouvet&quot; and the battleships proceeded on to Toulon, before departing again for Algiers for another escort mission. Once the French Army units had completed their crossing by late August, the Group C ships were tasked with patrolling merchant traffic between Tunis and Sicily to prevent contraband shipments to the Central Powers.

In November, she and the armored cruiser were sent to relieve the British armored cruisers and as guard ships at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal. She remained there only briefly, however, before she was ordered north to the Dardanelles to relieve the battleship on 20 December. Over the coming months, the Triple Entente amassed a large fleet tasked with breaking through the Ottoman defenses that guarded the straits. During this period, before the start of major offensive operations, the Anglo-French fleet alternated between anchorages at Tenedos and Mudros Bay on the island of Lemnos, and it was tasked with patrolling the entrance to the straits to ensure that &quot;Goeben&quot;—which had by then been transferred to the Ottoman Navy as &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot;—did not attempt to sortie. On 1 February 1915, the ships sailed to Sigri on the island of Lesbos.

====Dardanelles campaign====

By mid-February 1915, the French and British had assembled a fleet of four French and twelve British battleships, including &quot;Bouvet&quot;, to lead the assault on the Dardanelles. The plan called for Ottoman defenses to be neutralized to allow the fleet to enter the Sea of Marmara and attack Constantinople directly. The first stage of the attack began on 19 February, which saw &quot;Bouvet&quot; and &quot;Suffren&quot;, together with the British battlecruiser and the pre-dreadnought battleships , , and , bombard the coastal defenses protecting the entrance of the straits. During the bombardment, &quot;Bouvet&quot; assisted the battleship &quot;Suffren&quot; by sending firing corrections via radio while &quot;Gaulois&quot; provided counter-battery fire to suppress the Ottoman coastal artillery. Another attempt was made six days later, with &quot;Bouvet&quot; again spotting for &quot;Gaulois&quot;; this attack was more successful, and the French and British battleships silenced the outer fortresses, allowing minesweepers to enter the area and begin clearing the minefields protecting the straits. The French division steamed into the Gulf of Saros on the Aegean coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula on 1 March to scout Ottoman positions in the area. They then covered the British battleships as they bombarded Ottoman positions in the straits on 5 March, before taking their turn the next day, when they attacked the fortification at Dardanus.

On 18 March, the French and British squadrons made another attack on the straits, directed at the inner ring of fortresses that guarded the narrowest part of the Dardanelles. The larger British contingent, commanded by Rear Admiral John de Robeck, was to make the initial attack at longer range, led by the powerful dreadnought battleship ; once the batteries were reduced, the French ships, under Guépratte, were to enter the straits and attack at closer range. &quot;Bouvet&quot; and &quot;Suffren&quot; were to attack the fortresses on the Asian side of the straits, while &quot;Gaulois&quot; and &quot;Charlemagne&quot; were to silence the batteries on the European side. Mistakenly believing the Ottoman guns to have been largely neutralized by the British bombardment, Guépratte led his ships to within of the inner fortresses and engaged in an artillery duel. &quot;Suffren&quot; and &quot;Bouvet&quot; operated as a pair, taking alternating passes at high speed to make it more difficult for the Ottoman gunners to score hits. Nevertheless, by 14:00, &quot;Bouvet&quot; had taken several hits and two of her casemate guns had been knocked out. A serious fire had also been started on her bridge, though she had succeeded in neutralizing the Hamidieh battery. In the course of the attack on the fortresses, &quot;Bouvet&quot; sustained eight hits from Turkish artillery fire. Her forward turret was disabled after the propellant gas extractor broke down.

At around 13:45, de Robeck had ordered Guépratte to withdraw his ships so their British counterparts could take their turn against the Ottoman fortifications. &quot;Bouvet&quot; was at that time battling the fort at Namazieh, and her commander, (Ship of the line captain) Rageot de la Touche, initially did not respond to Guépratte&#x27;s instruction to follow &quot;Suffren&quot; out of the narrows. After Guépratte again ordered him to break off contact, de la Touche turned &quot;Bouvet&quot; south to withdraw. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Bouvet&quot; was rocked by a major explosion, followed by a large cloud of red-black smoke; observers aboard the other ships could not immediately tell whether she had been hit by an Ottoman shell, torpedoed by a shore-mounted torpedo battery, or if she had struck a mine. The escorting destroyers and picket boats raced to the scene to pick up her crew, but in the span of just two minutes, &quot;Bouvet&quot; capsized and sank. A total of 75 of her crew were pulled from the water; 24 officers and 619 enlisted men died in the sinking. Most of the survivors were rescued by the British destroyer . The ship was in poor condition at the time due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. Guépratte himself remarked that &quot;that ship must have had poor stability.&quot; It was later determined that &quot;Bouvet&quot; had struck a mine, which was part of a field that had been freshly laid a week before the attack, and was unknown to the Allies.

Despite the sinking of &quot;Bouvet&quot;, the first such loss of the day, the British remained unaware of the minefield, thinking the explosion had been caused by a shell or torpedo. Subsequently, two British pre-dreadnoughts, and , were sunk and the battlecruiser &quot;Inflexible&quot; was damaged by the same minefield. &quot;Suffren&quot; and &quot;Gaulois&quot; were both badly damaged by coastal artillery during the engagement. The loss of &quot;Bouvet&quot; and the two British battleships during the 18 March attack was a major factor in the decision to abandon a naval strategy to take Constantinople, and instead opt for the Gallipoli land campaign. While the Franco-British forces began preparations for the attack, &quot;Bouvet&quot;″s place in the fleet was filled by .

==Wreck==
In the early 2010s, Turkish marine archaeologists conducted sonar surveys of many of the wrecks from the Dardanelles campaign, including &quot;Bouvet&quot;. Research on the wrecks had long been difficult, as the area&#x27;s status as a busy maritime artery and the strong current combine to make diving difficult. The survey of &quot;Bouvet&quot;, which lies upside down on the sea floor, revealed that a 305 mm shell from an Ottoman shore battery had struck the ship at the waterline amidships on the same side as she struck the mine, which contributed to the fatal flooding that caused her to rapidly capsize and sink.

<text>Banco Galliano was the oldest bank in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.

==History==
In 1855, Antonio Luis Galliano (1803–1866) and his family, immigrants from Genoa via Cádiz, established A.L. Galliano Bankers in Gibraltar, better known as &quot;Banco Galliano&quot; in Spanish, or &quot;Galliano&#x27;s Bank&quot; in English. This family-owned bank was Gibraltar&#x27;s oldest bank, though it did not incorporate until August 1978. (Before that it was a partnership.) In 1987 Jyske Bank acquired Banco Galliano renaming it Jyske Bank (Gibraltar) Limited.

From the latter half of the 19th century, Galliano&#x27;s bank started to face competition. The Anglo-Egyptian Bank (later Barclays) opened a branch in 1888, and Credit Foncier (later Crédit Agricole) entered in 1920. There were also, by the start of the 20th century, four other small, family-owned banks – Cuby Brothers, Benzecry (&quot;El Banquerito&quot;; established 1882), Rugeroni Brothers (established 1919), and Marrache and Sons – but by 1940 these had ceased operating.

A.L. Galliano Bankers survived the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, and both world wars, albeit with difficulty. Gibraltarian Francis (Paco) Galliano OBE, the last Galliano to own and run the bank, entered the bank in 1944 at the age of 17. He became a partner in 1953 and the senior partner in 1964. His son, Frank Galliano was General Manager until the takeover.

==Trivia==

In 1822, the spanish guitar-maker Joséf Pagés made a Spanish guitar that came to belong to members of the Galliano family. Paco Galliano sold it in 2008 for £6,600.

<doc id="864558" wikidata="Q229770" url="?curid=864558" title="Zumwalt-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer is a class of three United States Navy guided-missile destroyers designed as multi-mission stealth ships with a focus on land attack. The class was designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support and secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare. The class design emerged from the DD-21 &quot;land attack destroyer&quot; program as &quot;DD(X)&quot; and was intended to take the role of battleships in meeting a congressional mandate for naval fire support. The ship is designed around its two Advanced Gun Systems (AGS), turrets with 920 round magazines, and unique Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) ammunition. LRLAP procurement was canceled, rendering the guns unusable, so the Navy re-purposed the ships for surface warfare. Starting in 2023, the Navy will remove the AGS from the ships and replace them with hypersonic missiles.

The ships are classed as destroyers, but they are much larger than any other active destroyers or cruisers in the U.S. Navy. The vessels&#x27; distinctive appearance results from the design requirement for a low radar cross-section (RCS). The &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class has a wave-piercing tumblehome hull form whose sides slope inward above the waterline, dramatically reducing RCS by returning much less energy than a conventional flare hull form.

The class has an integrated electric propulsion (IEP) system that can send electricity from its turbo-generators to the electric drive motors or weapons, the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), automated fire-fighting systems, and automated piping rupture isolation. The class is designed to require a smaller crew and to be less expensive to operate than comparable warships.

The lead ship is named for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt and carries the hull number DDG 1000. Originally, 32 ships were planned, with $9.6 billion research and development costs spread across the class. As costs overran estimates, the number was reduced to 24, then to 7; finally, in July 2008, the Navy requested that Congress stop procuring &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s and revert to building more &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; destroyers. Only three &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s were ultimately built. The average costs of construction accordingly increased, to $4.24 billion, well exceeding the per-unit cost of a nuclear-powered ($2.688 billion), and with the program&#x27;s large development costs now attributable to only three ships, rather than the 32 originally planned, the total program cost per ship jumped. In April 2016 the total program cost was $22.5 billion, $7.5 billion per ship. The per-ship increases triggered a Nunn–McCurdy Amendment breach.

==History==

===Background and funding===
Many of the features were developed under the DD-21 program (&quot;21st Century Destroyer&quot;), which was originally designed around the Vertical Gun for Advanced Ships (VGAS). In 2001, Congress cut the DD-21 program by half as part of the SC21 program; to save it, the acquisition program was renamed DD(X) and heavily reworked.

Originally, the Navy had hoped to build 32 destroyers. That number was reduced to 24, then to 7, due to the high cost of new and experimental technologies. On 23 November 2005, the Defense Acquisition Board approved a plan for simultaneous construction of the first two ships at Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Ingalls yard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and General Dynamics&#x27; Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. However, at that date, funding had yet to be authorized by Congress.

In late December 2005, the House and Senate agreed to continue funding the program. The U.S. House of Representatives allotted the Navy only enough money to begin construction on one destroyer as a &quot;technology demonstrator&quot;. The initial funding allocation was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007. However, this was increased to two ships by the 2007 appropriations bill approved in September 2006, which allotted US$2.568 billion to the DDG 1000 program.

On 31 July 2008, U.S. Navy acquisition officials told Congress that the service needed to purchase more s and no longer needed the next-generation DDG 1000 class; only the two approved destroyers would be built. The Navy said the world threat picture had changed in such a way that it made more sense to build at least eight more &quot;Burke&quot;s rather than DDG 1000s. The Navy concluded from fifteen classified intelligence reports that the DDG 1000s would be vulnerable to forms of missile attacks. Many Congressional subcommittee members questioned that the Navy completed such a sweeping re-evaluation of the world threat picture in just a few weeks, after spending some 13 years and $10 billion on the development of the surface ship program known as DD-21, then DD(X), and finally DDG 1000. Subsequently, Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead cited the need to provide area air defense and specific new threats such as ballistic missiles and the possession of anti-ship missiles by groups such as Hezbollah. The mooted structural problems have not been discussed in public. Navy Secretary Donald Winter said on 4 September, &quot;Making certain that we have—I&#x27;ll just say, a destroyer—in the &#x27;09 budget is more important than whether that&#x27;s a DDG 1000 or a DDG 51&quot;.

On 19 August 2008, Secretary Winter said that a third &quot;Zumwalt&quot; would be built at Bath Iron Works, citing concerns about maintaining shipbuilding capacity. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman John Murtha said on 23 September 2008 that he had agreed to partial funding of the third DDG 1000 in the 2009 Defense authorization bill.
A 26 January 2009 memo from John Young, the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s (DoD) top acquisition official, stated that the per ship price for the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers had reached $5.964 billion, 81 percent over the Navy&#x27;s original estimate used in proposing the program, resulting in a breach of the Nunn–McCurdy Amendment, requiring the Navy to re-certify and re-justify the program to Congress or to cancel its production.

On 6 April 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that the DoD&#x27;s proposed 2010 budget would end the DDG 1000 program at a maximum of three ships. In April, the Pentagon awarded a fixed-price contract with General Dynamics to build the three destroyers, replacing a cost-plus-fee contract that had been awarded to Northrop Grumman. At that time, the first DDG 1000 destroyer was expected to cost $3.5 billion, the second approximately $2.5 billion, and the third even less.

What had once been seen as the backbone of the Navy&#x27;s future surface fleet with a planned production run of 32 has since been replaced by destroyer production reverting to the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class after ordering three &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s. In April 2016, the U.S. Naval Institute stated that the total cost of the three &quot;Zumwalt&quot; ships is about $22.5 billion with research and development costs, which is an average of $7.5 billion per ship.

===Construction===
In late 2005, the program entered the detailed design and integration phase, for which Raytheon was the Mission Systems Integrator. Both Northrop Grumman Ship Systems and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works shared dual-lead for the hull, mechanical, and electrical detailed design. BAE Systems Inc. had the advanced gun system and the Mk 57 Vertical Launching System (VLS). Almost every major defense contractor (including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine, and L-3 Communications) and subcontractors from nearly every state in the U.S. were involved to some extent in this project, which was the largest single line item in the Navy&#x27;s budget. During the previous contract, the development and testing of 11 Engineering Development Models (EDMs) took place: Advanced Gun System, Autonomic Fire Suppression System, Dual Band Radar [X-band and L-band], Infrared, Integrated Deckhouse &amp; Apertures, Integrated Power System, Integrated Undersea Warfare, Peripheral Vertical Launch System, Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), Tumblehome Hull Form. The decision in September 2006 to fund two ships meant that one could be built by the Bath Iron Works in Maine and one by Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi.

Northrop Grumman was awarded a $90M contract modification for materials and production planning on 13 November 2007. On 14 February 2008, Bath Iron Works was awarded a contract for the construction of , and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding was awarded a contract for the construction of at a cost of $1.4 billion each.
On 11 February 2009, full-rate production officially began on the first &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer. Construction on the second ship of the class, &quot;Michael Monsoor&quot;, began in March 2010. The keel for the first &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer was laid on 17 November 2011. This first vessel was launched from the shipyard at Bath, Maine, on 29 October 2013.

The construction timetable in July 2008 was:
* October 2008: DDG 1000 starts construction at Bath Iron Works
* September 2009: DDG 1001 starts construction at Bath Iron Works.
* April 2012: DDG 1002 starts construction at Bath Iron Works
* April 2013: DDG 1000 initial delivery
* May 2014: DDG 1001 delivery
* March 2015: Initial operating capability
* Fiscal 2018: DDG 1002 delivery

The Navy planned for &quot;Zumwalt&quot; to reach initial operating capability (IOC) in 2016. The second ship, &quot;Michael Monsoor&quot;, was commissioned in 2019, and the third ship, , was to have reached IOC in 2021.

== Ships in class ==
In April 2006, the Navy announced plans to name the first ship of the class &quot;Zumwalt&quot; after former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. &quot;Bud&quot; Zumwalt Jr. The vessel&#x27;s hull number would be DDG 1000, which abandoned the guided-missile destroyer sequence used by the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class destroyers (DDG 51–) and continued the previous &quot;gun destroyer&quot; sequence from the last of the , .

The Navy announced on 29 October 2008 that DDG 1001 would be named for Master-at-Arms 2nd Class Michael A. Monsoor, the second Navy SEAL to receive the Medal of Honor during the Battle of Ramadi (2006) in the Iraq War. Monsoor had deliberately fallen upon a grenade to reduce danger to his SEAL teammates.

On 16 April 2012, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that DDG 1002 would be named for former naval officer and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

The Navy chose to use an unusual two-part commissioning scheme for the ships. The initial commissioning was done prior to weapons systems integration, and the ships were placed in the status of &quot;in commission, special&quot; before sailing to San Diego for weapons installation and final acceptance. The first two ships used this approach, while the last one will use the more traditional approach with formal commissioning after final acceptance.

== Design ==
As of January 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that four out of 12 of the critical technologies in the ship&#x27;s design were fully mature. Six of the critical technologies were &quot;approaching maturity&quot;, but five of those would not be fully mature until after installation.

===Stealth===
According to a Naval Sea Systems Command spokesman, despite being 40% larger than an &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer, the radar cross-section (RCS) is more akin to that of a fishing boat. The tumblehome hull and composite deckhouse reduce radar return. Overall, the destroyer&#x27;s angular build makes it &quot;50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer.&quot;
The acoustic signature is comparable to that of the s. Water sleeting along the sides and passive cool air induction in the mack reduces infrared signature.

The composite deckhouse encloses many of the sensors and electronics. In 2008, &quot;Defense News&quot; reported there had been problems sealing the composite construction panels of this area; Northrop Grumman denied this.

The U.S. Navy solicited bids for a lower-cost steel deckhouse as an option for DDG 1002, the last &quot;Zumwalt&quot; destroyer, in January 2013. On 2 August 2013, the U.S. Navy announced it was awarding a $212 million contract to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works to build a steel deckhouse for destroyer &quot;Lyndon B. Johnson&quot; (DDG 1002). The U.S. Naval Institute stated, &quot;the original design of the ship would have had a much smaller RCS, but cost considerations prompted the Navy over the last several years to make the trades in increasing RCS to save money.&quot;

To improve detection in non-combat situations by other vessels, such as traversing busy shipping channels or operating in inclement weather, the Navy is testing adding onboard reflectors to improve the design&#x27;s radar visibility.

The usefulness of the stealth features has been questioned. The class&#x27;s role was to provide Naval Surface Fire Support, which requires the ship to be in typically crowded near-shore waters where such large and distinctive ships can be tracked visually, and any surface ship becomes non-stealthy when it begins firing guns or missiles.

===Tumblehome wave-piercing hull===
The &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer reintroduces the tumblehome hull form, a hull form not seen to this extent since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. The appearance has been compared to that of the historic USS &quot;Monitor&quot; and her famous antagonist CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;. The hull form was originally put forth in modern steel battleship designs by the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne, Toulon. French naval architects believed that tumblehome, in which the beam of the vessel narrowed from the waterline to the upper deck, would create better freeboard, greater seaworthiness, and, as Russian battleships were to find, would be ideal for navigating through narrow constraints (e.g., canals). On the downside, the tumblehome battleships leaked – partly due to their riveted construction – and could be unstable, especially when turning at high speed. The tumblehome has been reintroduced in the 21st century to reduce the radar return of the hull. The inverted bow is designed to cut through waves rather than ride over them. The stability of this hull form in high sea states has caused debate among naval architects, with some charging that &quot;with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water—and basically roll over.&quot;

===Advanced Gun System===

The Advanced Gun System is a 155 mm naval gun, two of which are installed in each ship. This system consists of an advanced 155 mm gun and its Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP). This projectile is a rocket with a warhead fired from the AGS gun; the warhead has an 11 kg / 24 lb bursting charge and has a circular error probable of 50 meters. This weapon system has a range of . The fully automated storage system has room for up to 750 rounds. The barrel is water-cooled to prevent overheating and allows a rate of fire of 10 rounds per minute per gun. Using a Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI) firing tactic, the combined firepower from a pair of turrets gives each &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer initial strike firepower equivalent to 12 conventional M198 field guns. The &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s use ballast tanks to lower themselves into the water for a reduced profile in combat. In November 2016, the Navy moved to cancel procurement of the LRLAP, citing per-shell cost increases to $800,000–$1 million resulting from trimming of total ship numbers of the class. Since the AGS was tailor-made to use the LRLAP, it was unable to fulfill the naval gunfire support role it was designed for.

&quot;Lyndon B. Johnson&quot;, the last &quot;Zumwalt&quot;, was being considered for the installation of a railgun in place of one of the 155 mm naval guns after the ship was built. This would be feasible because the installed Rolls-Royce turbine generators are capable of producing , enough for the electrically powered weapon. In 2021, U.S. Navy funding for railgun development ceased with no plans to continue the project. Both guns on all three ships were scheduled to be removed and replaced with hypersonic missiles starting in 2023.

=== Advanced Payload Module ===
In March 2021, the Navy solicited information from the industry on how to reconfigure the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class ships to host Long-Range Hypersonic Weapons (LRHW). Since they would be too large to fit in the VLS tubes, it has been suggested that the two AGS, having no use since the cancellation of their ammunition, could be replaced with three-pack advanced payload modules to fulfill a conventional prompt strike deterrence role. The Navy will request FY 2022 funding to replace the 155 mm AGS turrets with Advanced Payload Modules for the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) hypersonic missile. The conversion would be part of the DDG 1000 Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA) beginning FY 2024. The LRHW is also slated for Block V &quot;Virginia&quot;-class attack submarines (SSN). The larger tubes for the VLS will be based upon the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) used in the &quot;Virginia&quot; SSNs. The first &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer will be ready to test the CPS in 2025. In mid-August 2023 the lead vessel arrived at Pascagoula to have the AGS replaced by the Hypersonic missile tubes and the integration of the new weapons system.

===Peripheral Vertical Launch System===
The Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launch System (PVLS) is a missile launch system designed to avoid intrusions into the prized center space of the hull while reducing the risk of loss of the entire missile battery or the ship in a magazine explosion. The system consists of pods of VLS cells distributed around the ship&#x27;s outer shell, with a thin steel outer shell and a thick inner shell. The design of the PVLS directs the force of any explosion outward rather than into the ship. Additionally, this design reduces the loss of missile capacity to only the affected pod.

===Aircraft and boat features===
Two spots are available on a large aviation deck with a hangar capable of housing two full-size SH-60 helicopters. Boats are handled within a stern-mounted boat hangar with a ramp. The boat hangar&#x27;s stern location meets high sea state requirements for boat operations.

===Radar===
Originally, the primarily X band AN/SPY-3 active electronically scanned array radar was to be married with Lockheed Martin&#x27;s AN/SPY-4 S-band volume search radar. Raytheon&#x27;s X-band, active-array SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar (MFR) offers superior medium to high altitude performance over other radar bands, and its pencil beams give it an excellent ability to focus on targets. SPY-3 will be the primary radar used for missile engagements. A 2005 report by Congress&#x27; investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), questioned that the technology leap for the Dual Band Radar would be too much.

On 2 June 2010, Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter announced that they would be removing the SPY-4 S-band Volume Search Radar from the DDG 1000&#x27;s dual-band radar to reduce costs as part of the Nunn–McCurdy certification process. Due to the SPY-4 removal, the SPY-3 radar will have software modifications for volume search functionality. Shipboard operators will be able to optimize the SPY-3 for either horizon search or volume search. While optimized for volume search, the horizon search capability is limited. The DDG 1000 is still expected to perform local area air defense. This system is thought to provide high detection and excellent anti-jamming capabilities, particularly when used in conjunction with the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC). It is, however, not reported if the CEC system will be installed on the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers upon commissioning, but it is scheduled for eventual incorporation in the ship type.

In that the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class has no AN/SPG-62 fire-control radars, which are used for terminal guidance for Standard and Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) anti-aircraft engagements, the SPY-3 will generate Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination (ICWI) rather than the Continuous Wave Illumination of the AN/SPG-62 fire-control radars. Significant software modifications are required to support the ICWI and transmit and receive link messages to the missiles. Standard Missile (SM)-2 IIIA and the ESSM slated for &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class require modified missile receivers, transmitters, encoders, decoders, and a redesigned digital signal processor to work with the ship&#x27;s system. These modified missiles will not be able to be used on Aegis class ships.

The SPY-3 had to be reprogrammed to do the volume search that the SPY-4 was supposed to have performed. With the duties of volume and surface search and terminal illumination, there is concern that a large-scale missile attack could overwhelm a radar&#x27;s resource management capacity. In such a case, the radar may be unable to manage incoming threats properly or guide offensive missiles.

The Dual Band Radar in its entirety (SPY-3 &amp; SPY-4) is to be installed only on the . With the development of the AN/SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR), it seems unlikely the DBR will be installed on any other platforms, as it is on the DDG 1000 class, or in total, as it is on &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;. The Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar (EASR) is a new design surveillance radar that is to be installed in the second &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot;-class aircraft carrier, , instead of the Dual Band radar. The s starting with LHA-8 and the planned s will also have this radar.

The AN/SPY-6 AMDR was originally proposed to be installed in the hull of DDG 1000 type under the CG(X) program. However, the CG(X) program was canceled due to cost growth. The AMDR has continued in fully funded development for installation on the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class destroyer Flight III ships, with plans to be also installed on Flight IIA ships. However, a smaller than optimally planned aperture of , the AMDR for the Flight III ships is to be less sensitive than the variant that had been planned for CG(X).

A study to place the AN/SPY-6 on a DDG 1000 hull was done with the aperture primarily for Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) purposes. In that the DDG 1000 does not have an Aegis Combat System, as does the DDG 51 class ships, but rather the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), the Radar/Hull Study stated:

===Common Display System===
The ship&#x27;s Common Display System is nicknamed &quot;keds&quot;: Sailors operate keds via trackballs and specialized button panels, with touchscreens option to the interface. The technology array allows sailors to monitor multiple weapons systems or sensors, saving manpower, and allowing it to be steered from the ops center.

===Sonar===
A dual-band sonar controlled by a highly automated computer system will be used to detect mines and submarines. It is claimed that it is superior to the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class″s sonar in littoral ASW but less effective in blue water/deep sea areas.
* Hull-mounted mid-frequency sonar (AN/SQS-60)
* Hull-mounted high-frequency sonar (AN/SQS-61)
* Multi-function towed array sonar and handling system (AN/SQR-20)

Although &quot;Zumwalt&quot; ships have an integrated suite of undersea sensors and a multi-function towed array, they are not equipped with onboard torpedo tubes, so they rely on their helicopters or VL-ASROCs to destroy submarines that the sonar picks up.

===Propulsion and power system===
&quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class ships use an Integrated Power System (IPS), a modern version of a turbo-electric drive system. The IPS is a dual system, with each half consisting of a gas turbine prime mover directly coupled to an electrical generator, providing power for an electric motor that drives a propeller shaft. The system is &quot;integrated&quot; because the turbo-generators provide electrical power for all ship systems, not just the drive motors. The system provides much more available electrical power than is available in other types of ships.

The DDX proposed using permanent-magnet motors (PMMs) within the hull, which was abandoned in favor of a more conventional induction motor. An alternate twin pod arrangement was rejected as the ramifications of pod drives would require too much development and validation cost to the vessel. The PMM was considered to be another technology leap and was the cause of some concern (along with the radar system) from Congress. As part of the design phase, Northrop Grumman had the world&#x27;s largest permanent magnet motor designed and fabricated by DRS Technologies. This proposal was dropped when the PMM motor failed to demonstrate that it was ready to be installed in time.

&quot;Zumwalt&quot; has Converteam&#x27;s Advanced Induction Motors (AIM) rather than DRS Technologies&#x27; Permanent Magnet-Synchronous Motors (PMM).
The exact choice of engine systems remains somewhat controversial at this point. The concept was originally for an integrated power system (IPS) based on in-hull permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMMs), with Advanced Induction Motors (AIM) as a possible backup solution. The design was shifted to the AIM system in February 2005 in order to meet scheduled milestones; PMM technical issues were subsequently fixed, but the program has moved on. The downside is that AIM technology has a heavier motor, requires more space, requires a &quot;separate controller&quot; to be developed to meet noise requirements, and produces one-third the amount of voltage. On the other hand, these very differences will force time and cost penalties from design and construction changes if the program wishes to &quot;design AIM out&quot; …

The system reduces the ship&#x27;s thermal and sound signature. As noted by the GAO, the IPS has added to weight growth in the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer.

Electric power is provided by two Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines (35.4 MW ea.) driving Curtiss-Wright electric generators.

The second ship of the class, &quot;Michael Monsoor&quot;, will require a new gas turbine after she experienced problems during sea trials resulting in damaged turbine blades.

===Automation and fire protection===
Automation reduces crew size on these ships: the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer&#x27;s minimum complement is 130, less than half that of similar warships. Smaller crews reduce a significant component of operating costs. Ammunition, food, and other stores are all mounted in containers able to be struck below to magazine/storage areas by an automated cargo handling system.

Water spray or mist systems are proposed for deployment in the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer, but the electronic spaces remain problematic to the designers. Halon/nitrogen dump systems are preferred but do not work when space has been compromised by a hull breach. The GAO has noted this system as a potential problem yet to be addressed.

===Computer network===
The Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) is based on General Electric Fanuc Embedded Systems&#x27; PPC7A and PPC7D single-board computers&lt;ref name=&quot;TSCEI/GEFanuc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; running LynuxWorks&#x27; LynxOS Real-time operating system (RTOS). These are contained in 16 shock, vibration, and electromagnetic protected Electronic Modular Enclosures. &quot;Zumwalt&quot; carries 16 pre-assembled IBM blade servers. The network allows seamless integration of all onboard systems, e.g., sensor fusion and easing operation and mission planning.

==Criticism==
An April 2018 GAO report said the total cost of the three Zumwalt destroyers, including research and development, was $24.5 billion—an average of about $8 billion per ship.

Lawmakers and others questioned whether the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class costs too much and whether it provides the capabilities that the military needs. In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the acquisition cost of a DD(X) at $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2007 dollars, $1.1 billion more than the Navy&#x27;s estimate. The National Defense Authorization Act For the Fiscal Year 2007 (Report of the Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives on H.R. 5122 Together With Additional And Dissenting Views) stated:
Mike Fredenburg analyzed the program for National Review after &quot;Zumwalt&quot; broke down in the Panama Canal in November 2016. He concluded that the ship&#x27;s problems &quot;are emblematic of a defense procurement system that is rapidly losing its ability to meet our national security needs.&quot; Fredenburg went on to detail problems relating to the skyrocketing costs, lack of accountability, unrealistic goals, a flawed concept of operations, the perils of designing a warship around stealth, and the failure of the Advanced Gun System. He concludes: 
===Ballistic missile/air defense capability===
In January 2005, John Young, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition, was so confident of the DD(X)&#x27;s improved air defense over the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot; class that between its new radar and ability to fire SM-1, SM-2, and SM-6, &quot;I don&#x27;t see as much urgency for [moving to] CG(X)&quot; – a dedicated air defense cruiser.

On 31 July 2008, Vice Admiral Barry McCullough (Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Integration of Resources and Capabilities) and Allison Stiller (Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Ship Programs) stated that &quot;the DDG 1000 cannot perform area air defense; specifically, it cannot successfully employ the Standard Missile-2 (SM-2), SM-3 or SM-6 and is incapable of conducting Ballistic Missile Defense.&quot; Dan Smith, president of Raytheon&#x27;s Integrated Defense Systems division, has countered that the radar and combat system are essentially the same as other SM-2-capable ships, &quot;I can&#x27;t answer the question as to why the Navy is now asserting … that &quot;Zumwalt&quot; is not equipped with an SM-2 capability&quot;. The lack of anti-ballistic missile capability may represent a lack of compatibility with SM-2/SM-3. The &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class ships have BMD systems with their Lockheed-Martin AEGIS tracking and targeting software, unlike the DDG 1000&#x27;s Raytheon TSCE-I targeting and tracking software, which does not, as it is not yet complete, so while the DDG 1000, with its TSCE-I combat system, does have the SM-2/SM-3 missile system installed, it does not yet have the BMD/IAMD upgrade planned for the derived CG(X). The Aegis system, on the other hand, was used in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System. Since Aegis has been the Navy&#x27;s chief combat system for the past 30 years, when the Navy started a BMD program, the combat system it was tested on was the Aegis combat system. So while the DDG 51 platform and the DDG 1000 platform are both SM-2/SM-3 capable, as a legacy of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, only the DDG 51 with the Aegis combat system is BMD capable. However, the DDG 1000&#x27;s TSCE-I combat system had both BMD and IAMD upgrades planned. Combined with recent intelligence that China is developing targetable anti-ship ballistic missiles based on the DF-21, this may be considered a fatal flaw.

On 22 February 2009, James &quot;Ace&quot; Lyons, the former commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, stated that the DDG 1000&#x27;s technology was essential to a future &quot;boost phase anti-ballistic missile intercept capability.&quot;

In 2010, the Congressional Research Service reported that the DDG 1000 could not currently be used for BMD because the BMD role was deferred to the DDG 1000 derived CG(X) program (the DDGs had the strike role, the CG had the BMD role, but they shared both the SM3 missile and the TSCE-I), the proposed radar of the CG(X) was much larger (22&#x27;) and used much more energy and cooling capacity than the DDG 1000&#x27;s. Since then, the radar system has been canceled with the CG(X), and it has been determined that a radar could be used either on DDG 51 or DDG 1000, though it would not have the performance the Navy predicts would be needed &quot;to address the most challenging threats&quot;. Were the CG(X)&#x27;s BMD requirement adopted by the DDG 1000, the DDG 1000 would have to get the TSCE-I upgrade slated for the CG(X) to support that mission.

The study that showed a cost benefit to building Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer with enhanced radars instead of adding BMD to the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers assumed very few changes from the Flight II to III &quot;Burke&quot;s. However, costs for the Flight III &quot;Burke&quot;s have increased rapidly &quot;as the possible requirements and expectations continue to grow.&quot; While the Flight III design and costs have been studied by the Navy, there is very little reliable data available on the cost of modifying a DDG 1000–class ship to provide a BMD capability. However, if the Air Missile Defense Radar is adopted in common on both the Flight III &quot;Burke&quot;s and the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s, and if they were both upgraded to the same combat system, then the only limitation of the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;s in this role would be their limited missile magazines.

With the awarding of the development contract to the next generation Air and Missile Defense S-Band Radar to Raytheon, deliberation to put this radar on the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer is no longer being actively discussed.

It is possible for the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers to get the more limited BMD hardware and software modifications that would allow them to use their existing SPY-3 radar and Cooperative Engagement Capability to utilize the SM-3 missile and have a BMD capability similar to the BMD-capable s and &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class Flight IIA destroyers. Procurement of a BMD-specific version of the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer was also proposed.

&quot;Zumwalt&quot; PLAS cells can launch the SM-2 Standard missile, but the ships have no requirement for ballistic missile defense. The tubes are long and wide enough to incorporate future interceptors, and although the ship was designed primarily for littoral dominance and land attack, Raytheon contended that they could become BMD-capable with few modifications.

===Missile capacity===
The original DD-21 design would have accommodated between 117 and 128 VLS cells. However, the final DDG 1000 design provides only 80 cells. &quot;Zumwalt&quot; uses Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launching System (PVLS) cells, which are larger than the Mk 41 cells found on most American destroyers.

Each VLS cell can be quad packed with RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missiles (ESSM). This gives a maximum theoretical load of 320 ESSM missiles. The ESSM is considered a point defense weapon not generally used for fleet area defense.

The &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyer is not an Aegis system. It instead uses the class-unique Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) integrated mission system. The Mk 57 PVLS is capable of accommodating all Standard missile types. It has not been publicly stated if the TSCE will be modified to support the Standard missile or the ballistic missile defense mission.

===Naval fire support role===
The design concept for the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class developed from the &quot;Land Attack Destroyer (DD 21)&quot; development effort. A primary goal for DD 21 was to provide sea-based fire support for on-shore troops as part of the force mix that would replace the retiring s as mandated by Congress. There was considerable skepticism that the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class could succeed in this role.
The &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class was intended to provide naval surface fire support (NSFS) using the AGS and additional land attack using Tomahawk missiles from its PVLS launchers. As deployed, the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class cannot provide NSFS since there are only 90 rounds of ammunition available that are compatible with the AGS in total. The &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class were re-purposed as surface attack vessels and are no longer intended for use as land attack destroyers.

===Tumblehome design stability===
The stability of the DDG 1000 hull design in heavy seas has been a matter of controversy. In April 2007, naval architect Ken Brower said, &quot;As a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have tumblehome instead of a flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship come back up. On the DDG 1000, with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water – and basically, roll over.&quot; The Navy had decided not to use a tumblehome hull in the CG(X) cruiser before the program was canceled, which may suggest that there were concerns regarding &quot;Zumwalt&quot;″s seakeeping abilities. However, the tumblehome hull proved seaworthy in a 1/4-scale test of the hull design named &quot;Sea Jet&quot;.

The Advanced Electric Ship Demonstrator (AESD) &quot;Sea Jet&quot;, funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is a 133-foot (40-meter) vessel located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, Acoustic Research Detachment in Bayview, Idaho. &quot;Sea Jet&quot; was operated on Lake Pend Oreille, where it was used to test and demonstrate various technologies. Among the first technologies tested was an underwater discharge waterjet from Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, Inc. called AWJ-21.

While underway during the spring of 2019, USS &quot;Zumwalt&quot; sailed through a storm causing sea state six (maximum wave height between and ) conditions off the coast of Alaska. The test indicated that the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class possesses greater stability compared to typical hull forms. During an interview, Captain Andrew Carlson, the commanding officer of USS &quot;Zumwalt&quot; at the time, related, &quot;All told I&#x27;d rather be on that ship than any other ship I&#x27;ve been on.&quot; According to Captain Carlson, during the storm, he summoned his executive officer from his cabin to inform him of the sea state six conditions. Based on the rolls he had been experiencing in his cabin, the executive officer thought that, at most, they were at sea state three, where wave height only reaches a maximum of . A combination of the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class&#x27;s hull form, rudder stop locations, and propeller size contribute to its improved seakeeping.

===Secondary guns===
In 2005, a Critical Design Review (CDR) of the DDG 1000 led to the selection of the Mk 110 cannon to defend the destroyer against swarming attacks by small, fast boats; the Mk 110 has a rate of fire of 220 rpm and a range of . From then to 2010, various analysis efforts were conducted to assess potential cost-saving alternatives. Following a 2012 assessment using the latest gun and munition effectiveness information, it was concluded that the Mk 46 Gun System was more effective than the Mk 110 with increased capability, reduced weight, and significant cost avoidance. The Mk 46 has a rate of fire of 200 rpm and a range of .

Naval experts have questioned the decision to replace the close-in swarm defense guns of the &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers with ones of decreased size and range. The 57 mm can engage targets at two to three miles, while the 30 mm can only start to engage at around one mile. However, the DDG 1000 program manager said that the 57 mm round&#x27;s lethality was &quot;significantly over-modeled&quot; and &quot;not as effective as modeled&quot; in live test-firing, and &quot;nowhere near meeting the requirements&quot;; he admitted that the results were not what he expected to see. When the Naval Weapons Laboratory re-evaluated the Mk 46, it met or exceeded requirements and performed equal to or better than the 57 mm in multiple areas, even coming just ahead of the naval cannon. A 30 mm gun mount also weighs less, around 2 tons compared to 12–14 tons for the 57 mm, but the Navy is adamant that weight had nothing to do with the decision.

<text>Keith Inch (originally &quot;Keith Insche&quot;, &quot;Keithinche&quot; or &quot;Caikinche&quot;) is the easternmost point of mainland Scotland, having formerly been an island. It is located in Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, forming the north point of Peterhead Bay. It is now joined to Greenhill, another former island, previously separated from Keith Inch by the Poolmouth. Greenhill Road leads the motorist onto Greenhill from the town via Alexandra Parade.

It forms part of Peterhead Harbour. &quot;Inch&quot; is a common Scottish word for an island, such as Inchcolm, Inchkenneth and (Hebrides), and derives from the Scottish Gaelic .

It was used in the whaling industry, and boil yards were here; the remains of a whale bone arch can be seen.

==Castle of Keith Inch==

On the island of Keith Inch once stood a castle built by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, in the late 16th century. The castle is thought to have been modelled on the castle of Kronborg in Denmark. In 1644 about 500 of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s English soldiers rampaged in the Peterhead area. They were encamped on Keith Inch, with their headquarters in the castle.

After 1715, it was purchased by Thomas Arbuthnot, who built a modern house to the north of the island. When it was abandoned, it was converted into partly a fish-house and partly into boil yards. The final complete vestiges were removed in the late 19th century, although an occasional &quot;massive&quot; stone wall can be found.

<text>The [[Mull (geographical term)|Mull]] of Galloway (, ; ) is the southernmost point of Scotland. It is situated in Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway, at the end of the Rhins of Galloway peninsula.

The Mull has one of the last remaining sections of natural coastal habitat on the Galloway coast and as such supports a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is now a nature reserve managed by the RSPB. Mull means rounded headland or promontory.

The Mull of Galloway Trail, one of Scotland&#x27;s Great Trails, is a long-distance footpath that runs from the Mull of Galloway via Stranraer to Glenapp near Ballantrae, where the trail links with the Ayrshire Coastal Path.

==Lighthouse==

An active lighthouse is positioned at the point. Built in 1830 by engineer Robert Stevenson, the white-painted round tower is high. The light is above sea level and has a range of . The lighthouse and lighthouse keepers&#x27; houses are designated as a Category A listed building.

During World War II, on 8 June 1944 at 7.30 pm, a French member of the British Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), Cladius Echallier, died by striking the Lighthouse in a Beaufighter, while making a low landfall from the Irish Sea.

The lighthouse is now automatic, and an old outhouse has been converted into a visitor centre, run by the South Rhins Community Development Trust, a group of local people and businesses. In 2013 there was a community buyout and the Mull of Galloway Trust purchased land and buildings, with the exception of the tower, from Northern Lighthouse Board.

In 2004 a new café was built at the Mull of Galloway, called the &quot;Gallie Craig&quot;. Its design incorporates into the landscape with a turf roof, giving views across to Northern Ireland and southwards to the Isle of Man.

<doc id="864567" wikidata="Q1790876" url="?curid=864567" title="Cuban hip-hop">
<text>Hip hop music arrived in Cuba via radio and TV broadcasts from Miami. During the 1980s, hip hop culture in Cuba was mainly centered on breakdancing. By the 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the onset of the Special Period, young rappers, exposed to foreign tourists whose wealth highlighted their struggle, turned to rapping to affirm their heritage and advocate for further revolutionary reforms.

==Early days: Importation==
The importation of Cuban rap is debated, but many argue that it was brought from Miami. Rap hit Cuba approximately a quarter century ago, gaining popularity in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union. However it existed among young moneros, who had a tremendous oral ability and linguistic creativity. At the beginning of establishing Rap in Cuba rap like rock was perceived as a foreign import and while it was never forbidden, neither was it promoted or encouraged&quot; 
The Cuban government changed its perceptions about hip hop during 1999 when they declared it as an authentic expression of Cuban culture. In addition the government formed the Agencia Cubana de Rap (The Cuban Rap Agency) that provides state-run record label and hip hop magazine, and began supporting the annual Cuban Hip Hop festival. Cuban rappers injected a renovating energy into Cuban music that was taken from hip hop culture. Rap in Cuba began to emerge precisely during the gangsta rap period in the United States which included artists like 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G, Ice-T, Snoop Dogg and many more influential gangster rappers.

Gradually this began to change as &quot;raperos&quot; began to express their own reality and make use of traditional Cuban culture. One sentiment expressed involved how Cuban politics were not keeping pace with social reality. All Cubans are discouraged from visiting government-designated &#x27;tourist zones,&#x27; such as the fancy restaurants and night clubs in Old Havana, and police will ask most who show up there for ID. But statistics show that the police arrest Afrocubans all over the island more often than Whites. Many Afrocubans believed government assumes Blacks are more likely to be involved in criminal activity. 
This exclusion from night life led to the importance of house parties where &quot;raperos&quot; were able to establish their own &quot;underground&quot; hip hop scene. The financial constraints of tourist geared night clubs that only accept dollars or venues that cost up to the equivalent of a standard monthly Cuban salary for entry also aided in the significance of house parties in the Cuban hip hop scene.

In the mid-1990s, the music scene was one of the most promising for Cubans to meet tourists and gain possible access to much needed hard currency. Hip-hop developed new dance moves involving the &#x27;solo&#x27; female body: the &quot;despelote&quot; (all-over-the-place) and &quot;tembleque&quot; (shake-shudder) and the &quot;subasta de la cintura&quot; (waist auction). These moves define a solo female dance style which involves fast movement and turning/swirling of the area from below shoulders and chest to pelvis (as if one was hula hoop-ing or belly dancing). Often accompanied by hand and body gestures mimicking self-pleasuring, it constituted a noticeable change in dance style, of women dancing to be &#x27;looked at&#x27; both by their partners, by other prospective partners, and by other spectators, using their body as a major asset. This was in contrast to traditional dancing such as normative couple dancing.

==Birth of a Cuban scene==
=== American Influence ===
The change in both attitude towards hip hop and the move towards home grown expression was in part facilitated by the involvement of New Afrikan Revoluationay Nehanda Abiodun, a U.S. Black Liberation Army activist in political exile in Cuba. Upset with what she saw as blind imitation of commercial US rap culture with its depiction of thug life, violence, and misogyny, Abiodun began working with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement in the US to bring progressive US hip hop artists to Cuba. This led to the Black August benefit concerts held in New York City and Havana, which have featured artists such as Erykah Badu, David Banner, Common, dead prez, Fat Joe, the Roots, Jean Grae, Les Nubians, Chuck D, Gil Scott-Heron, Dave Chappelle, Tony Touch, Black Thought, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, La Bruha, and Imani Uzuri. 

The Black August Collective that was formed, and the concerts these progressive US artists gave in Cuba, played a key role in expanding and raising the profile of conscious, politicized rap within Cuba. Many Cuban rappers felt an affinity to the revolutionary aspects of the work these artists created. The Black August Hip Hop Collective Statement of Purpose offers that &quot;Our goal is to bring culture and politics together and allow them to naturally evolve into a unique hip hop consciousness that informs our collective struggle for a more just, equitable and human world&quot;. Despite the movement&#x27;s association with an identity other than Cuban, the government supported The Black August Collective and allowed the rappers to perform as they were supportive of the revolution. The youth of Cuba were fascinated not only by this style of music, but also by the Black Pride of the performers. This consciousness of struggle and achieving the goals of revolution are a key characteristic of a majority of Cuban hip hop today.

=== The Underground Scene ===
In the early stages of Cuban hip hop there was minimal technology to record their beloved hip hop. This made it virtually impossible to duplicate the exotic sounds in Cuba. This lack of technology led to the private gatherings of very devoted fans called, &quot;bonches&quot;. These bonches can be considered the seeds of today&#x27;s Cuban rap community. Only the most dedicated fans would be in attendance and they would receive an understanding of raps evolvement and fame outside of Cuba. Eventually, the gatherings attracted too many people and they were forced out of private homes. In 1994, rap entrepreneur, Adalberto Jímenez was able to get a public space for these amazing hip hop gatherings. This public space was known as, el local de la Moña. This place would be a spot to find beautiful women, great drinks, and innovative Cuban hip hop. Moñas were so popular that it became the Cuban word for rap and Moñeros for rappers or rap enthusiasts. This is not a place for tourists, but mostly for young, black Cubans. La Moña moved around a great deal and became a sort of traveling party in Old Havana. La Moña charged a 5-peso admission charge, which would have translated to about 20 cents. In January 1999, La Moña moved to a tiny club called La Pampa and they had raised the price of admission to 20 pesos. This price is too high for a lot of the destitute Cubans in Havana. La Moña still remains the only place for moñeros to hear the latest underground rap in Cuba.

In the underground scene of Cuba, freestyle becomes a manifestation of a communal establishment (usually the community of rappers and audience come to form a cycle) where those who are not rapping provide vocalized &quot;backing track&quot;, opened for anyone to jump it for a freestyle. Cuban scholar Geoffrey Baker argues that those music-making circles &quot;enable a community to generate (rather than simply embody) a different social order and a distinct set of moral values.&quot;

=== Government Support ===
Hip-hop arrived in the public eye with the launch of the &quot;Festival de Rap Cubano&quot; in 1995, a joint effort by Grupo Uno and the state-run &quot;Asociación de Hermanos Sais&quot; (AHS). Despite poor promotion and the remote location, it became a huge success. &quot;Rap cubano&quot; emerged as a distinct genre when Amenaza (now known internationally as the Orishas) incorporated Afro-Cuban bata percussion into their performance at the 1996 festival, winning them first place in the competition. The same year, Cuba&#x27;s first all-female rap group, , secured second place for their energetically charged rap flow and performance. By 1999, through the aid of the &quot;Hip Hop Manifesto&quot; (written by DJ Ariel Fernandez), &quot;rap cubano&quot; and rock music (another marginalized musical genre in Cuba) was declared &quot;an authentic expression of Cuban culture&quot; by Abel Prieto, Cuba&#x27;s Minister of Culture. Fidel Castro deemed hip hop music to be at the &quot;vanguard of the Revolution&quot; because of its revolutionary message. This resulted in the formation of the Agencia Cubana de Rap (Cuban Rap Agency), the state&#x27;s organization that runs a record label and hip hop magazine, &quot;Movimiento&quot;.

In 2002 the government formed the Agencia Cubana de Rap (Cuban Rap Agency) with its own record label and hip hop magazine to help promote the art form on the island. Weekly radio and TV shows were launched. With the creation of the Cuban Rap Agency by the Cuban government, this group encouraged and endorsed various rappers and created their albums. However, there was a down-side to this agency that affected the popularity of the CRA. Getting artists and bands radio time and fame, came at a slight price; there were limits as to how artists could express themselves. Thus, the CRA would only endorse groups that were willing to change their lyrics and music styles to those that were accepted by the government and community. As a result, not many groups or artists were willing to give into the CRA expectations.

However, that early support waned in the mid 2000s, drawing criticism from &quot;raperos&quot; who felt robbed of their platform to address social problems. In 2006, after ten years of hosting popular Cuban &quot;raperos&quot;, the AHS disbanded the &quot;Festival Cubano de Rap.&quot; This inspired a renewed interest in independent concerts and festivals and a revival of the underground scene at events like Project Almendares in the Vedado district of Havana, hosted by prominent local DJ Alexis &quot;D&#x27;Boys&quot; Rodriguez and financed by international backers.

=== Nightlife ===
Hip hop and rap clubs, while scarce today in Cuba, emerged as an open and affordable gathering space for lower and middle-class Cubans who are increasingly excluded from other forms of Havana nightlife due to rising prices, dollarization of popular clubs and increasing segregation on behalf of tourists and the wealthy Cuban elite. Under these divisive socio-economic conditions, hip hop and rap concerts have now come to represent a space of open debate and social and political discussion for many young Cubans. Topics such as racism, tourism and police harassment are often addressed openly in these spaces through music and performance as well as through participatory discussion.

==Criticism of Cuban hip hop==
Many have criticized the new movement of Cuban Reggaeton and hip hop artists for their recent change in meaning of the music. Cuban rappers attack social and political issues concerning Cuba such as racism, class struggles and police harassment etc. But as pressure for commercial success increases, some artists have toned down their political or socially conscious content, and instead have focused on tropes common in commercial rap. Many of the grass roots artists do not understand the recent change of rapping about partying, cars, and women. &quot;Hip-hop in the United States started out as a voice of protest, an alternative voice for urban, inner-city youth to voice their grievances, to talk about their living conditions, their hopes and aspirations,&quot; said Abiodun, a member of the Black Liberation Party before fleeing to Cuba 14 years ago as a U.S. fugitive facing racketeering charges. &quot;But now what we see in terms of rap in the United States, for the most part, it&#x27;s really not talking about anything.&quot; Also many criticize the objectification of females in the dancing and in videos. Some see it as dominant if the women dance in front of the men in a &quot;doggy style&quot; position, but critics see it as a way of letting the male take initial control over the female. Also many argue that the females in those music videos are objectifying themselves to seem lower than men.

Music videos are becoming more explicit. To gain a following of their music, Cuban hip hop artists are continuously using provocatively dressed females. This sexual image in their videos is taking away from the audiences ability to actually listen to the lyrics and understand them. The lyrics being addressed recently by Cuban hip hop artists stand as a rebellion against the many downfalls, such as poverty and racism, that their nation is currently fighting. It would benefit all of Cuba to take the time to understand the lyrics and not just watch the images of the videos.

Sexually charged dancing (like grinding and &quot;doggy style&quot;) often associated with hip hop, are not the only things criticized. In recent years, Hip-hop has merged with Cuban culture to the point it can be heard in parades, school dances, and clubs. This has given rise to the problem of children, 16 or younger, hearing and singing the lyrics found in Cuban hip hop and reggaeton, which often make reference to sexual activities.

Cuban hip hop that addresses political issues, however, are not widely commercialized. These types of music that can be listen to by all Cubans of any age, tend to stay underground and are suppressed by the government, leaving a majority of Cubans no choice but to listen to salsa, reggaeton, or mainstream rap.

==Clash with Reggaetón==
Most recently, the term &quot;underground&quot; has become more appropriate for rap. The most popular urban music in the country is now reggaeton. Recently, there has been an explosion in popularity of reggaeton, particularly among Cuba&#x27;s 5 million people under the age of thirty. &quot;Reggaetœn&quot; –whose lyrics emphasize sensuality, individualism and sex, in graphic and sexually explicit terms– stands in sharp contrast to the tradition of Cuban underground rap, the content of which is more often characterized by social commentary on inequality and injustice. &quot;Reggaetón&quot; versus Cuban rap has become a contentious debate in Cuba. It&#x27;s driven many within the socially conscious rap scene to paint &quot;reggaetón&quot; as the &quot;enemy&quot; due to its focus on mindless dancing rather than community reflection. Furthermore, its critics condemn the genre as lyrically and musically deficient, morally questionable, and too commercially oriented. Nehanda Abiodun, an American living in Cuba to avoid charges of racketeering, who has advocated strongly for Cuban hip hop and rap, said of &quot;reggaetón&quot; &quot;There is an element of commercialism that&#x27;s creeping in...You cannot blame these young people for wanting to see the fruits of their labor, but will they be able to maintain that responsible, intellectual rap and still get paid?&quot; 

According to Geoff Baker, rap promotes social awareness better than &quot;reggaetón&quot;. Since rap is verbally expressed with a lesser focus on dancing the artists can more easily convey their messages. In contrast &quot;reggaetón&quot; places a larger emphasis on movement expression than vocal expression. Furthermore, Baker attributes a lack of originality to &quot;reggaetón&quot; because only a single unchanging beat may be heard throughout a whole track. An article from a major Cuban social change news source, &quot;Cubanet,&quot; reinforces the opinion that rap motivates change while &quot;reggaetón&quot; inspires merely dancing. The article 
quotes Cuban rapper Cabera, aka Papa Humbertico explaining that rap talks &quot;about the reality of a Cuban&#x27;s life in our songs, what happens to us in the street.&quot; In contrast Cabera believes &quot;&quot;All reggaeton does is make people stupid.&quot; The author of the article assumes that Cabera&#x27;s statement derives from the &quot;preoccupation&quot; with dance of &quot;reggaetón&quot;. In summary, some believe that rap is more easily expressive while &quot;reggaetón&quot; conveys its message less understandably through dance.

The dissemination of &quot;reggaetón&quot; in Cuba is altogether peculiar and familiar. The guerilla marketing of &quot;reggaetón&quot; with its homespun production value, bicycle taxi advertising
and the informal mass distribution in urban areas has led to its accessibility to the Cuban community at large. This rings familiar with US music industry marketing strategies. The peculiarity of &quot;reggaetón&quot;&#x27;s dissemination is raised when contextualized within the nationalistic Cuban hip hop scene. Socially conscious hip hop was nationalized into Cuba &quot;as a process of engagement between artists and audiences mediated by the state, rather than by the music industry or by recording technology.&quot; This stark contrast between the sources of support and means of dissemination is just one of several reasons of conflict between the two genres in Cuban popular music.

==Themes in Cuban Hip-Hop==
A search for identity is characteristic of the genre. The challenge of situating themselves within the Revolution, which in its early days professed to eliminate racial and class distinctions, defines the artistry of most &quot;raperos&quot;. Many Cuban rappers use their music as an opportunity to speak out against problems within Cuba or on global issues including war, racism, and pollution. Many Cuban rappers refer to the subjects of their rap as &quot;temas sociales&quot; or &quot;social themes.&quot; By involving these social and political themes, they try to make their music constructive and influential to their listeners. Two important themes that are manifested in many of the songs involves the global issue of AIDS and the destructiveness of war. Although these themes may be useful to the listeners in Cuba, many people speak against the governments use of music to influence people.
Politics is so deeply rooted in the hip hop scene in Cuba that the revolutionary image of Che Guevara is frequently seen, as the late figure represents the early stage in the Revolution and embodies youthful idealism. According to Geoffrey Baker, the history and legend of Che allows artists to practice &quot;safe radicalism.&quot;

There are many ways in which Cuban hip hop artists achieve a sense of nationalism through their music. Many Cuban hip hop artists attempt through the musical backing track arrangements and sounds. Rhythms borrowing from traditional Cuban music style have been incorporated in hip hop music. Native instruments such as bata drums, maracas, and guaguanco have been part of the indigenization hip hop music in Cuba.

In addition to musical instrumentation, language also plays a large part in the shaping and nationalization of Cuban hip hop. Language barriers between the US and Cuba allowed for Cuban hip hoppers to embrace the musical aesthetic of the music, but leave behind the lyrical content. This can be seen through similarity between Cuban and US hip hop beats; and the differences between lyrical content performed over the US songs and Cuban songs. Additionally, the distinct (Cuban) Spanish dialect used to deliver the lyrics contributes to the nationalistic value of Cuban hip hop, and is viewed as characteristic which sets it apart from other Spanish-speaking countries and the US alike.

The lyrical content, in and of itself, also speaks to the struggles and hardships experienced by Cubans in impoverished inner city areas of Havana. The harsh Cuban reality, in this way, provides a lens into the unique inner-city experience of Cubans suffering from socio-economic hardships. According to Marc Ramirez, hip hop has acted as tool for youth in Cuba to speak out. Here, Ramirez pinpoints the importance of hip hop in Cuban culture—even more so than other native musical styles: &quot;In Cuba, where teenagers and young adults see their world torn by social ills including street hustling and racism, there are worse things to worry about than power outages. And it&#x27;s hip-hop - not salsa or rumba or the Buena Vista Social Club - that sustains the disillusioned&quot; (Ramirez). Additionally, political and historical events are resonant in the music making, it a unique expression of Cuban culture. For instance, the group Instisto incorporates texts about the Afro-Cuban deity Obatala. Additionally, the rap duo Anónimo consejo frequently expresses their love for Cuba through their politically and socially conscious lyrics.

At the same time that Cuban rappers have used the genre to speak out about the realities of their daily lives and issues that are often politely overlooked in Cuban culture, they also walk a fine line since so much of the hip hop scene is supported by the government. When the state and its nationalist perspective plays such a large role in the production and promotion of Cuban hip hop, artists must make careful decisions about how much criticism they really want to offer of the regime. When they rap about the realities of race or the sense that poverty and economic hardship are not being alleviated by the state, they risk breaking the close ties they have to the government and thus put their success on the line. Some groups have gone too far and faced sanctions or censorship However, many Cuban artists seem to have reached a consensus with the state&#x27;s involvement in rap, accepting that the government&#x27;s role may lead to better production, more support, and more commercial exposure. On the other hand, the government seems to accept and respect the revolutionary nature of hip hop and embrace that it is a means for the marginalized or downtrodden to speak up. In fact, many Cuban rap groups openly criticize the government, and many others openly assimilate to the government&#x27;s nationalist ideals. The relationship can be characterized as encompassing both censorship and assimilation

Although rap Cubano clearly adopted many musical techniques and stylistics characterized by rap in the US, the artists do not take such an adversarial role against the Cuban government for several reasons. First, the state supports hip hop culture as a vehicle of progressive revolution which is openly accepted in the midst of a polarized socio-political shift from Communism to Market Capitalism. Secondly, young Havana artists realize that their government provides free health care and education, as well as a generally more equitable distribution of resources. In contrast to US rap, rap Cubano&#x27;s economic, and socio-political support elucidates a stark discrepancy in the motivation and ethos of the genres. While the foundation of gangsta rap is rooted in histories of state abandonment and discrimination, rap Cubano formulates a less polarized musical expression that lyrically portrays the realities of a new generation of Cuban artists searching for identity.

== Women in Cuban Hip-Hop ==
Like men, women were distinctly affected by the introduction of capitalism into Cuba. &quot;Jineterismo&quot;, a form of prostitution for tourists, affords poor Cuban women access to American dollars that they cannot earn working for the state. Despite the sacrifice of their bodies to earn money, &quot;raperas&quot; assert that equality is impossible without showing them respect, too.

While many female rappers exist, the lesbian trio, Krudas Cubensi, otherwise known as &quot;Las Krudas&quot;, have received a lot of attention in numerous documentaries and dissertations for their open homosexual identity. Las Krudas went on to form Omega Kilay (a female rap collective) in 1999 with fellow female rappers (&quot;raperas&quot;), I-n-I, DJ Leidis, DJ Yary. The majority of these women have left Cuba, however, along with many other male rappers due to ongoing censorship and lack of performance opportunities. The female group &quot;Explosion Femenina&quot; (or &quot;Oye Habana&quot;) combines sex appeal with wit to captivate its audience. Other female rappers like Mariana and Telmary have broken out of all-male crews to establish their own voice and talents. Rather than identify as Cuban first and foremost, members of &quot;Las Krudas&quot; call themselves other things as well: feminists, Afro-Cubans, and poor. The group speaks out against &quot;machismo&quot;, the dominance of men in Latin American cultures like Cuba. For &quot;Las Krudas&quot;, it is important to acknowledge social and economic differences among Cubans in order to re-imagine the gender roles that restrict many Cuban women in domestic roles like housekeeping.

Without widespread commercialization of music throughout Cuba, female hip-hop groups depend on public performances to express their identity and struggles. As Afro-Cuban men attempt to re-insert race into public conversations, their female counterparts simultaneously advocate racial and feminist discourses. Contrary to American hip-hop&#x27;s reputation for outspoken misogyny, Cuban hip-hop has developed spaces for feminist thought due to &quot;Las Krudas&quot; and other female groups.

Still, state control of the industry has limited their popularity and success. Concerts organized by the Cuban Agency of Rap often fail to pay female performers. In one instance, eleven performances combined to feature one woman, Magía Lopez of the husband-wife duo &quot;Obsesión&quot;, who was under contract with the Agency. On one hand, female &quot;raperas&quot; identify many flaws within Cuba that reflect failures of the Revolution to achieve equality. On the other, they assert that their brand of hip-hop is as Cuban, and therefore revolutionary, as any cultural production on the island. This is seen in &quot;Vamos a Vence,&quot; a &quot;Las Krudas&quot; song which incorporates rhetoric first used by Fidel Castro to inspire community, pride, and a revolutionary spirit within the Cuban people. In a 21st-century context, this defines a struggle for gender equality as well as the persistence of other social inequities that Cuban &quot;raperos&quot; first tackled.

Today, current and former members of &quot;Las Krudas&quot; live in the United States, where they continue to advocate for gender and sexual equality through North American tours, Internet campaigns, and trips to Cuba to support up and coming artists.

== Distribution ==
From the 1980s onward, Cubans have shared their love of music in private circles. The first sounds of American hip-hop came from Miami through radio waves in homes throughout Havana and elsewhere on the island. As &quot;raperos&quot; toured internationally during the 1990s, they brought back new records and mixtapes on CDs which exposed them to a greater diversity of music. Very few albums were actually sold in Cuba, however.

As the Internet became widely used worldwide, Cubans were left out of an explosion of cultural production and transmission. By the turn of the 21st century, international travel had become less restrictive for artists and more and more CDs came back. &quot;Quemadores&quot;, literally &quot;burners,&quot; decided to copy CDs onto USB flash drives to be shared person-to-person. This practice continues today alongside the &quot;pakete&quot;, a curated collection of entertainment including international rap music drawn from YouTube and other Internet sources.

==Cuban slang==
&quot;Yuma&quot; is a Cuban street slang word for foreigners in general. Originally this word meant &quot;Yankee&quot;, a person from the United States. Cubans use this word only for people from the U.S., but U.S. people are not the only visitors to Cuba. A song was made named &quot;A ti te gustan los yumas.&quot; There were a couple reasons why this song was made, including the thought that Cuban women prefer foreign men for money. 

==Notable Groups==
As of 2016, there were over 500 signed hip-hop artists in Cuba. However, whilst there has been much academic and media interest in Cuban hip hop, few Cuban groups have managed to be heard outside of the island.

Probably the most successful rap group to come out of Cuba was the Orishas. Starting off under the name &quot;Amenaza&quot; or &quot;Threat,&quot; the group was the first to deal with issues of race and challenge Castro&#x27;s idea of colorless, or &quot;color-blind,&quot; society. However, the Orishas relocated to Paris in 1998. There, they produced rap and hip hop with the classic Cuban sounds of salsa and rumba.

In 2003 Europe based female Cuban singer Addys Mercedes released her innovative album &quot;Nomad&quot; mixing her Cuban roots with elements of hip hop, house and R&amp;B. In her 2012 released 3rd album &quot;Addys&quot;, which was mainly produced in a singer/songwriter atmosphere, Addys Mercedes in the song &quot;Alma Latina&quot; was rapping about immigration from Cuba.

The movement dwindled in popularity in the mid-2000s. Constrained by the state and seeing better economic opportunities elsewhere, artists like Ariel Fernandez Diaz and &quot;Las Krudas&quot; left for the United States, Europe, or other countries in Latin America. They constitute a Cuban hip-hop voluntary exile community that utilizes more widely available Internet resources and exposure to voice socially-conscious messages.

&quot;Los Aldeanos&quot; led a new generation of &quot;raperos&quot; in the late 2000s and early 2010s who rejected a conciliatory tone towards the Cuban government. Facing censorship for more aggressive anti-state rhetoric, the group was controversial within Cuba. In recent years, it has been discovered that the group was in part financed by a Serbian contractor. Additional accusations of support from USAID contribute to a state belief that &quot;Los Aldeanos&quot; worked against the Revolution. Like many other groups, the duo has moved abroad to more freely work.

<text>Middle Mouse ( - &quot;Patrick&#x27;s island&quot;) is an uninhabited island situated 1 kilometre (1000 yards) off the north coast of Anglesey. It is notable as the northernmost point of Wales. The island measures a maximum of 207 metres (226 yards) by 110 metres (120 yards), with a maximum area of 3.7 acres and has a maximum altitude of 16 metres (52&#x27;) above sea level. It is one of a chain of three islands off the north of Anglesey, the others being Ynys Amlwch and Maen y Bugail.

Local legend has it that St Patrick was shipwrecked there, giving rise to its Welsh name. He then swam ashore and eventually founded the nearby church of Llanbadrig in about 440 AD, believed to be the oldest Christian site in Wales.

Middle Mouse is a favoured place for cormorants, guillemots and razorbills. For visiting scuba divers the attractions are steep underwater cliffs that drop away to 40 metres (130&#x27;) with abundant marine life. There is very little protection from the fierce tidal flow, so accurate timing for slack water is required.

During the 19th century the island was used as a navigational aid to ships sailing into Liverpool. Any vessel that passed the island without signalling, and waiting for, a pilot was liable to incur a fine. The S.S. &quot;Liverpool&quot;, following a collision with a ship named &quot;Laplata&quot;, was shipwrecked near Middle Mouse in 1863. She had on board a shipment of tin ingots.

In 2005, the island was put up for sale as part of a estate.

<text>Point of Ayr () is the northernmost point of mainland Wales. It is situated immediately to the north of Talacre in Flintshire, at the mouth of the Dee estuary. It is to the southwest of the Liverpool Bay area of the Irish Sea. It is the site of a RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) nature reserve RSPB Dee Estuary Point of Ayr, and is part of Gronant and Talacre Dunes Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Coal==
For many years a colliery operated at Point of Ayr at the northern extremity of the Flintshire Coalfield; it was one of the last remaining operational deep mines in Wales. The first trial borings took place in 1865, under the direction of Lord Mostyn, owner of Mostyn Colliery, a few miles away. The borings seemed successful, and the Prestatyn Coal Company was formed to commence operations proper, however the project was abandoned before it got off the ground. In 1873, the site was investigated a second time, by a newly formed company, the Western Mostyn Colliery Company, however the trial shaft was not successful, and the project was again abandoned.

In 1883, a third company was formed, the Point of Ayr Colliery Company, and in 1890 they struck a seam. Coal at this time was brought to the surface by a team of 75 pit ponies. A second shaft was also sunk around this time. According to the Inspector of Mines records, in 1896 the pit employed 356 men producing coal for domestic and industrial uses. A third shaft was sunk sometime after the National Coal Board took over the site following nationalisation in 1947. The coal field extended northwards under the Irish Sea. Six men have been killed during the sink of a new shaft on the 4th of July 1952. By 1953, 738 men were producing 213,000 tons of coal annually. Point of Ayr colliery closed on 23 August 1996. Nothing now remains of the colliery. However, like many former coal mines, the name is retained by &quot;Point of Ayr Colliery Band&quot;, a Brass Band competing at Championship level.

The site was chosen in the early eighties for a demonstration &quot;Oil from Coal&quot; plant jointly funded by the government, the National Coal Board and others. Bench scale trials was carried out on site but the project became a victim of the miners strike and the subsequent cut back in research funding for this and clean burn technology. The plant never became operational and was scrapped.

==Gas==
Point of Ayr is also the place where natural gas from the Celtic gas-fields comes ashore. Gas is piped through a pipeline 33.5 km (20 mile) long from the Douglas Complex of gas and petroleum drilling platforms in the Irish Sea. The Point of Ayr gas terminal has a gas processing capacity of per day at standard conditions. The facilities remove methanol (used for hydrate inhibition), water and condensate. The gas is sweetened with an amine solvent to remove sulphur compounds to below 3.3 ppm and chilled to reduce the hydrocarbon dewpoint. The processing plant was originally part of the BHP development of the Liverpool Bay area, but now owned and operated by Eni. Gas is transported through a 27-km (17 mile) underground pipeline at 30 bar along the North Wales coast to Connah&#x27;s Quay. After further processing, the gas is sold to Uniper, for their combined cycle gas turbine power station at Connah&#x27;s Quay, on Deeside, in Flintshire.

==Lighthouse==

Point of Ayr also gives its name to a lighthouse, built in 1776, though inactive since 1883. It stands on Talacre beach, at the entrance to the River Dee estuary. The lighthouse once displayed two lights. The main beam, at 63 feet, shone seaward towards Llandudno. A secondary beam shone up the River Dee, towards the hamlet of Dawpool, in Cheshire, on the English side of the estuary. Whilst in service, the lighthouse was painted with red and white stripes, and had a red lantern housing. It was replaced in 1844 with a metal pile lighthouse, bearing a white light, put up by order of the Corporation of Trinity House. This new structure was itself replaced in 1883 with a lightship.

<doc id="864578" wikidata="Q1428103" url="?curid=864578" title="List of Batman supporting characters">
<text>The Batman supporting characters are fictional characters that appear in the American comic books published by DC Comics featuring the superhero Batman as the main protagonist.

&quot;Batman family&quot; or &quot;Bat-Family&quot; is the informal term for Batman&#x27;s closest allies, who are mainly masked vigilantes operating in Gotham City. Since the Bat-Family&#x27;s introduction in 1939, Batman has accumulated a number of recognized supporting characters. The first Batman supporting character was Commissioner James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon, Batman&#x27;s ally in the Gotham City Police Department, who first appeared with Batman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939). Some of the other allies of Batman include his vigilante partner, Robin, who was introduced in 1940; his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, who was introduced in 1943; and Barbara Gordon, who was introduced in 1967.

Batman also forms bonds and close working relationships with other superheroes, including Justice League members such as Superman, Green Arrow, Zatanna and Wonder Woman, as well as members of the Outsiders superhero team. Others such as Jason Bard, Harold, Onyx, and Toyman work for him.

In addition, Batman has a collection of adversaries in fiction that is commonly referred to as Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery. The rogues gallery includes the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler, among others. He also has several love interests, including Catwoman, Talia al Ghul, Silver St. Cloud, Poison Ivy, and Julie Madison.

==Bat-Family==

The Bat-Family (sometimes referred to as the Gotham Knights) is the informal name for Batman&#x27;s closest allies collectively. It mainly consists of masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or who operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. Many of its members are also his adopted children, with the exception of Damian Wayne, the first of the Robins to be biologically related to Batman.

The group consists of similarly minded superheroes who operate in the Gotham City area and work towards achieving common goals. Batman is often the team leader or, in some cases, its dispatch. Various members of the group usually interact with one another and assist in each other&#x27;s cases, even within their respective series. Although some members occasionally resent Batman&#x27;s intrusion into their lives, all respect him as a part of the superhero community and rarely challenge his authority. Most of the members also have a strong rapport with Batman. In a 2002 storyline in which Bruce Wayne is accused of murder, Batman&#x27;s friends gather to prove his innocence. Throughout &quot;Batman&quot;&#x27;s history, it has also been implied that this network serves as a surrogate family for Batman and keeps him from slipping too far into his vigilante persona.

The GCPD were featured in their own series: the limited series &quot;Batman: GCPD&quot; and the ongoing series &quot;Gotham Central&quot;, in which they investigate the unusual crimes that plague the city, in a personal effort to minimize Batman&#x27;s involvement. The &quot;Gotham Central&quot; series ended its 40-issue run in 2006.

==DC superhero allies==

Batman regularly interacts with other DC superheroes in titles such as &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. A few, however, have had a marked presence in the core Batman titles:

==Antagonists==

Batman comics have introduced many classic villains. His rogues gallery is one of the most identifiable in modern fiction. The Joker, the Riddler, Catwoman, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin are some of the most recognizable foes; other notable villains include Poison Ivy, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Mr. Freeze, the Scarecrow, Bane, Killer Croc, the Mad Hatter, and Clayface, among others. Some of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery are notable for sometimes functioning as allies as well as villains. Some examples of this are Catwoman, the Riddler, Poison Ivy, Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Red Hood, Anarky, and Talia al Ghul. Recently, emphasis on the psychological motivations of Batman villains have painted them in a much more sympathetic light than in their earlier stories, most notably Mr. Freeze and the Ventriloquist in their &quot;&quot; incarnations.

==Love interests==
Unlike his peers from DC Universe, like Superman, Flash, Green Lantern etc., Batman never had an official single love interest, but several of them in its publishing history.

===Bruce Wayne&#x27;s love interests===
* Selina Kyle (Catwoman):
** Catwoman is the most enduring romantic interest of Batman/Bruce Wayne. In &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; Batman&#x27;s feelings towards her are based on the fact that she is sort of a female version of himself: another dark, beautiful creature that prowls in the night. In the current timeline, Batman and Catwoman became romantically involved during the &quot;&quot; story arc. Batman ended the relationship because he was afraid if they had a relationship that Hush would use her to get to him and also doubted her loyalty to him questioning if she was part of the plot to destroy his life. Even when their romance rekindled later on, Batman still suspected that Selina&#x27;s reformation could be a result of a personality-altering mindwipe by Zatanna. Later in &quot;Batman: Heart of Hush&quot; in an attempt to kill Bruce, Hush kidnaps Catwoman and cuts out her heart, when Bruce returns the heart he admits to Selina that she really was the only woman to have held his heart and that he would always love her.
** In Pre-Crisis continuity, the Earth-Two versions of Batman and Catwoman were shown to have married in the 1950s, and later Selina gave birth to a daughter, Helena Wayne (alias Huntress) in 1957.
** In Tim Burton&#x27;s film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Selina (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) seems to be the true love of Bruce&#x27;s life, as not only their costumed identities but also their disturbed psyches are described as similar. Their relationship becomes intensely dramatic towards the end of the movie, to the point where Bruce actually implores her to abandon her vendetta against Max Shreck and come and live with him in Wayne Manor. She was set to reappear in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, portrayed again by Pfeiffer, but Joel Schumacher scrapped the idea.
** In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, Selina Kyle (never referred to as Catwoman in the film) is portrayed by an actress Anne Hathaway as she is in the comics as a thief who aids Bane in hopes of obtaining the &quot;clean slate&quot; drive to erase her criminal record and to see the rich and selfish of Gotham suffer. She later aids Batman in stopping Bane after realizing her mistake of betraying him to the terrorist, giving up her own chance to escape Gotham and leave him behind. At the film&#x27;s end, she is seen in Italy wearing Martha Wayne&#x27;s necklace (which she stole earlier on in the film) and dating Bruce Wayne, who has retired from the mantle of Batman. 
** In &quot;&quot;, Bruce Wayne regularly dates Selina Kyle. In &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, Bruce hints at a relationship with Selina in his past, as well as comparing that relationship with Terry&#x27;s and the current Ten of the Royal Flush Gang. As in comic books, the sexual tension between their costumed characters is a major story point in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series.&quot; In the comic book adaption &quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot; #33, the Phantom Stranger shows Bruce a world where he never became Batman, married Selina and had two sons.
** In &quot;&quot;, Batman and Catwoman marry in an alternate future and she is the mother of Damian. However, this future is later revealed to have all been a story written by Alfred Pennyworth. 
** After The New 52, as it is Selina&#x27;s early days as Catwoman she does not yet know Batman&#x27;s identity, though it is evident they engaged in sexual intercourse.
** In &quot;Gotham&quot;, a 14-year-old Selina Kyle witnesses the murders of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Because of that, she stays at Wayne Manor to be protected, where she befriends the young Bruce Wayne. She saves him from a gang of hired killers and gives him his first kiss. Since then, the young Bruce and Selina have formed a very close relationship.
* Talia al Ghul: The daughter of the supervillain, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Talia&#x27;s father has encouraged the relationship in hopes of recruiting Batman as his successor. Unlike Catwoman, Talia is more than willing to play second-fiddle to Bruce&#x27;s mission.
** The two are at odds, as Talia has been brainwashed into hating both her father and Batman; however, she claims to be the mother of his son Damian, introduced in &quot;Batman&quot; #656. However, after Damian is murdered by a clone created by her, Batman is no longer affectionate towards her as he was in the past due to her indirect involvement in their son&#x27;s death, making him increasingly vengeful. 
** In the now out-of-continuity graphic novel &quot;&quot;, Talia bore his son (later named &quot;Ibn al Xu&#x27;ffasch&quot;).
** In Earth-22&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, Talia admires Batman in his drive, determination, and nobility, but is always torn between him and his love for her terrorist father.
** In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, Talia is played by actress Marion Cotillard. In the film, she is incognito as philanthropist and socialite Miranda Tate (a ploy used by her father with his false identity of Henri Ducard) and begins an affair with Bruce Wayne as well as becoming a Wayne Enterprises executive. Talia has assumed control of the League of Shadows and plans with Bane, who saved her as a child, to kill Bruce and destroy Gotham to fulfil her father&#x27;s mission and have vengeance for his death.
* Julie Madison:
** In the earliest Batman comics, Bruce Wayne dates the often-imperiled Julie Madison, an actress and socialite. The two eventually separate and Julie weds into European royalty, much in the manner of Grace Kelly. 
** In the New 52, Julie appears in a flashback-dream sequence as Bruce&#x27;s college girlfriend. She reappeared later, this time in the present time, as she has moved back to Gotham and wants to be reunited with Bruce. Alfred imagines what it would be like if Bruce and Julie got together and made a family, having a life without Batman. Unfortunately, Bruce could not meet with Julie because he was busy with crime fighting, much to Alfred&#x27;s displeasure. In &quot;Batman&quot; #43, Julie is the head of a clinic for underprivileged youth that Bruce Wayne is helping to finance and manage. After the events of &quot;&quot;, Bruce Wayne has begun a relationship with Julie and works for her in the clinic. 
** In &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Elle Macpherson plays Julie, Bruce&#x27;s girlfriend, though the character seems to have little in common with her comic book self. The character adds little to the plot, and many of her scenes were edited out of the film&#x27;s final cut.
* Vicki Vale:
** In several 1950s stories, a reporter for the &quot;Gotham Gazette&quot; newspaper Vicki Vale, was shown as an occasional romantic interest of Batman. Vicki Vale returned in the early 1980s, brought back by Doug Moench.
** Vale appeared in the second of Columbia&#x27;s Batman serials, &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, portrayed by Jane Adams.
** Kim Basinger plays Vicki in the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;. In the movie, she has come to Gotham City to do a story on Batman, but she soon becomes romantically involved with Bruce Wayne, unaware that he and Batman are the same person. Eventually, Vicki does learn Bruce&#x27;s secret identity. At the end of the film, Alfred Pennyworth chauffeurs her to Wayne Manor to await Bruce&#x27;s return once the night&#x27;s crime fighting is done. In &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, it is stated that she eventually left Bruce because she could not cope with his double life. In the early scripts of &quot;Returns&quot;, she was set to reappear, but Tim Burton scrapped the idea.
** In the animated film &quot;The Batman vs. Dracula&quot;, Vale is romantically linked to Bruce Wayne, even going as far as to mention the kind of impact the death of his parents could have on him, hinting that Vicki may know he is Batman.
** In the video game &quot;&quot;, Vicky apologizes to Bruce Wayne about a news article, apparently published by Jack Ryder, and asks &quot;Brucie&quot; to call her back. When talking to Jack Ryder as Batman, he reveals that Vale is dating Bruce Wayne, although Wayne never mentioned this in the game itself.
* Katherine &quot;Kathy&quot; Webb-Kane (Batwoman)
** In the original Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Kathy Kane is a wealthy Gotham City heiress and former circus performer who decides to use her skills and resources to become a costumed crimefighter. This is partly out of altruism and partly to attract the romantic attention of Batman. While Batman wished for Kane to retire from crimefighting due to the danger, she remained his ally. Kathy was romantically interested in Batman but Batman remained aloof until her death at the hands of Bronze Tiger. In the New 52&#x27;s title &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot;, it was revealed that Kathy was recruited into a covert spy organization called Spyral and as part of her first assignment, Kathy was tasked with tracking down Batman and discovering his true identity. Donning a female variation of Batman&#x27;s costume to gain his attention, she embarked on a career as a costumed crime-fighter while attempting to get close to Batman. Her plan succeeded but the two fell in love with one another, despite Kathy legally being Wayne&#x27;s aunt through her marriage with his mother&#x27;s brother, the late Nathan Kane. As a result, she refused to reveal his identity to her superiors at Spyral. Later, Kathy was threatened by Dr Dedalus to expose her to Batman unless she continued her mission. Heartbroken, she broke off her relationship with Bruce to save him from Dedalus&#x27; plan. Kathy reappears alive in the concluding issue of &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot;, in which she shoots Talia al Ghul dead in the Batcave, saving Batman&#x27;s life. Identifying herself as St Hadrian&#x27;s headmistress and requesting Batman not to go looking for her, she thanks Batman for leading Talia into her trap.
** In a Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Two, Kathy, who is a middle-aged woman, is still in love with the now-deceased Commissioner Bruce Wayne.
** In &quot;,&quot; while investigating the identity of Gotham&#x27;s newest masked vigilante, Batman develops an affection for one of the suspects, Kathy Duquesne, daughter of mob boss Carlton Duquesne.
* Linda Page: 
** Linda appeared during the Golden Age of Comics after Julie broke her engagement off with Bruce. A former socialite, she dedicated her time as a nurse for the elderly, instead of falling into the stereotype that rich women were spoiled and lazy. She dated Bruce for two years, but broke up with him when he would not explain why he seemed to be wooing another woman (trying to reform a disguised Catwoman).
** Linda appeared in the first Batman serial (1943), portrayed by Shirley Patterson.
* Silver St. Cloud: A storyline in the late 1970s featured Silver St. Cloud, who managed to deduce the secret of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s alter ego, but she could not handle being involved with someone in such a dangerous line of work. The two parted ways; 2005 six-issue miniseries &quot;Batman: Dark Detective&quot; features a return appearance of Silver St. Cloud, although the romance has not been rekindled. In &quot;&quot;, she and Bruce rekindle their romance on an island beach her family owns. Shortly after the two become engaged, Silver is murdered by the disguised villain Onomatopoeia by slicing Silver&#x27;s throat and mimicking the sound of the blade.
** In &quot;Gotham&quot;, a young Silver, the step-niece and ward of corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan, befriends and later starts dating the young Bruce Wayne, who is immediately smitten with her. Unbeknownst to him, Silver is helping Galavan in the Sacred Order of Saint Dumas&#x27; plan to kill Bruce and take over Wayne Enterprises. Bruce plans a fake abduction of Silver and himself to make her reveal everything she knows about his parents and her uncle&#x27;s plan. The plan works and Bruce finally sees Silver for who she really is, leaving her behind stunned and tearful. Later on in the series, Theo breaks into Wayne Manor and kidnaps Bruce. Silver, not wanting to witness Bruce&#x27;s death, pretends she&#x27;s feeling unwell. Theo accuses her of being weak and tells her to make Bruce fall in love with her again to prove she is worthy of the Dumas&#x27; name. She has a change of heart and tries to help Bruce escape, but their attempts are thwarted by Theo, and they&#x27;re both jailed. Bruce, knowing about Silver&#x27;s initial motivations, kisses her in front of Theo and forgives her. Bruce is then tied to a stake, where Father Creel prepares to kill him. Gordon and Cobblepot arrive with a group of henchmen and begin to fight the Order while Bruce is freed by Alfred and Selina Kyle. Theo and his sister, Tabitha, try to escape using parachutes.

* Pamela Lillian Isley (Poison Ivy): Batman&#x27;s attraction to Ivy is present in some way in several mediums in which the characters appear. There has always been a sexual tension between the two, most notably in their canonical earlier encounters. In her first appearance, Ivy is established as having an attraction to Batman, and tries to convince Batman to join her side and creates love potions that ensnare him. In the 1997 story &quot;Batman: Poison Ivy&quot;, Christopher DeJardin tries to kill Ivy, and Batman takes the bullet. Batman, who was wearing body armor, knocks him out. Ivy considers his saving her from death as proof he loves her, though he responds that she does not know the meaning of the word. Her attraction is confirmed in &quot;&quot;. At first, Ivy&#x27;s infatuation with Batman was one-sided; later stories presented the attraction as more mutual, but hindered by reluctance on Batman&#x27;s part. She later kisses Bruce during a robbery, poisoning him; when she subsequently kisses a dying Batman, she unknowingly cures her intended victim and establishes a budding romantic tension between them. During the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; story arc, Batman comes to her rescue while she is held captive by Clayface, with Ivy remarking that she knew he would. In &quot;Batman: Pavane&quot; (1989), while being interviewed as a potential candidate for the Suicide Squad, Pamela reveals to Inspector Stuart on how she became Poison Ivy. When she heard about Batman, she instantly fell in love with him—believing him to be the “perfect man”; going so far as to make a love shrine of him. With her goal set, she moved to Gotham, created a costume and renamed herself “Poison Ivy”; she then began committing crimes for the purpose of getting his attention in the hopes of them becoming the #1 crime couple. Unfortunately for Pamela, it did not work out the way she wanted it to, and so she was apprehended and sent to Arkham Asylum. In &quot;Batman: Hothouse&quot; (1992), Batman gains an obsession with Isley. Later, she kisses him. Now completely deranged, Ivy thinks herself &quot;Titania, Queen of the May&quot;, and Batman her Oberon - as Batman struggles with the hallucinations induced by the kiss, she pins him down and prepares to unmask him. With his last burst of strength, Batman kicks the greenhouse&#x27;s sprinklers on, washing away Ivy&#x27;s pheromones. The sobered Batman chases an increasingly desperate Ivy onto the greenhouse&#x27;s catwalks, where he barely manages to save Ivy from falling to her death. Subsequently, Ivy is returned to Arkham Asylum, her twisted love for Batman now stronger than ever. In one of the annuals of &quot;&quot;, a mutual attraction between Poison Ivy and the Batman is obvious right from the start. Ivy considers Batman &quot;the perfect man&quot;, and in a conversation with his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, he admits to finding her attractive and more appealing than Catwoman. In the &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; (1995) story &quot;Passion&#x27;s Fruit&quot; (1997), Ivy is depicted as feeling lonely and deeply missing Batman while at Arkham Asylum. She hatches a scheme to unleash some of her plant creations to cause havoc in Gotham, multiplying at contact with water, until Batman finally pays her a visit at the asylum. In exchange for the visit and a kiss, she morphs her creations into harmless strawberry plants. She is later in improved spirits. In&quot;Poison Ivy: Cast Shadows&quot; (2004), Batman and Ivy work together to find a killer carrying out a series of Ivy-like murders at Arkham. His butler, Alfred Pennyworth, notes that Batman has been poisoned by the flowers. Batman tells Alfred he must kiss Poison Ivy for the cure, and that if he fails Alfred must kill him. Ivy and Batman confront each other, where Batman warns Ivy that he will have to knock her out to kiss her to make sure that she does not kill him when he passes out after being cured. Ivy insists for him to trust her, despite Batman&#x27;s doubts. Batman at first decides to punch her, hesitates, then they embrace and kiss passionately instead. Upon being cured, he falls, but saves himself, and saves Ivy as Gotham Tower collapses when — assuming Batman dead — Ivy tries to kill herself, once more insinuating that it is more than just lust she feels for him. Ivy and Batman share a moment together speaking, watching her plant creations create light, and Batman compliments her on her talent. Batman takes Ivy back to Arkham Asylum, so that Ivy can finish her rehabilitation. Discouraged, Ivy complains to Batman about the lack of light in her cell, and Batman responds that there is nothing he can do about it, before departing. Transferred to a new cell the next morning, Ivy is stunned when she discovers that someone has had her room moved to a special cell where she can be in the sunlight, and has been filled with flowers as a gift. Upon being told some &quot;anonymous benefactor&quot; wanted to make sure her time is not as daunting as it might have been, a touched Ivy smiles and thanks Batman. In &quot;Gothtopia&quot;, Batman comes to her rescue when he realizes she was telling him the truth, even though he put her in Arkham. First, she punches him for not believing her claims, and then she kisses him for coming to her rescue, poisoning him with her mind control toxin. Resisting it, he warns that they would be best off helping each other for now. Thanks to her own resistance and the kiss he received, both Batman and Ivy become immune to the effects of the Scarecrow&#x27;s fear gas. The relationship even briefly deviated from the Batman/Ivy relationship into a Bruce/Pamela one when, in the comic series &quot;&quot;, he helps her return to normal. In The New 52, Ivy is shown to have some level of infatuation with Batman, even calling him &quot;the only one&quot; for her, though this is no longer apparent from DC Rebirth onwards.

====In other media====
=====Film=====

*Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman): Appears only in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; as the female lead. Chase was created specifically for the film by screenwriters Janet and Lee Batchler, as they thought that would be more interesting to have Bruce Wayne date a psychoanalyst rather than plucking a typical socialite love interest from the comics. Akiva Goldsman attempted to make the character sexier in subsequent drafts. Kidman described the character as a &quot;criminal psychologist who happens to have sort of the perfect blonde hair and the red lips and wear these sort of tight black dresses. So it&#x27;s a dichotomy - you have the criminal psychologist who dresses like Jessica Rabbit&quot;. Rene Russo was originally cast by Tim Burton for this role whilst he was still the director of the film and when Michael Keaton was still set to play Batman. However, when Burton was fired as Director and rehired as Producer, Keaton quit in disgust. Joel Schumacher, who Burton brought on board in his role as producer, decided to cast a younger Batman, eventually Val Kilmer and decided Russo was too old to play opposite a younger Batman. During recasting, Robin Wright turned down the role while Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton were also both considered. Chase is a psychologist working with the Gotham City police and falls in love with both Batman and Bruce Wayne. She assists Bruce in analyzing a series of befuddling threats sent to him by the Riddler and also witnesses the death of Robin&#x27;s parents by Two-Face. Later, she learns that Bruce is Batman after he invites her and tells her how he found the cave, and is kidnapped by the Riddler and Two-Face in a trap designed to make Batman choose between her and Robin. In the Riddler&#x27;s lair, she is chained to the sofa before Batman arrives and when she says Batman will come for her, to which Riddler states that he is &quot;counting on it&quot;. She and Robin are both placed in glass jars, bound and gagged, over a pit of water and metal spikes, with the Riddler able to release them at the touch of a button. He plans to determine whether Batman and Bruce Wayne can co-exist, will Batman save Bruce&#x27;s love or the Dark Knight&#x27;s partner. Batman saves them both after distracting the Riddler by giving him a riddle and breaking the device. Chase promises to keep his identity secret. She visits the Riddler after he screams in the asylum he knows Batman&#x27;s identity, but when she asks him, he says &quot;I am&quot; and shows himself to have made bat-like wings from his clothes. Outside Arkham, Chase meets with Bruce and says that his secret is safe as they kiss. She then gets in a car with Alfred while Batman and Robin leave to patrol Gotham. Her name is a play on words; as a psychologist in love with Bruce Wayne / Batman, she is constantly &quot;chasing&quot; the psychological &quot;middle&quot; of her lover, seeking to reconcile his two halves into one complete lover. In an interview, Kidman commented that she enjoy playing Meridian as a damsel in distress, as it gave her experience for similar roles in the future.
** A version of Dr. Chase Meridian is introduced in the DC Comics&#x27; mainstream continuity with the &quot;Herded Limits&quot; storyline in &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; during &quot;The New 52&quot;. The character is visually reimagined as a dark-skinned, red-haired woman to avoid paying Nicole Kidman for likeness royalties. She returns in &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; event &quot;Shadows of the Bat&quot; as a researcher at Arkham Tower under control of the Psycho Pirate.

In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Rachel is in a relationship with Harvey Dent. She is about to agree to marry Dent and writes a note to Bruce Wayne telling him of her choice, reflecting that, while she believes there might come a day when Gotham will no longer need Batman, she no longer believes there will be a time that &quot;Bruce&quot; will not need Batman. However, the mob kidnaps both Rachel and Harvey, resulting in Rachel&#x27;s death in an explosion while Harvey is accidentally rescued by Batman, as the Joker lies by switching the addresses for Rachel and Harvey, and Harvey&#x27;s transformation to Two-Face after part of his face is burnt. Alfred later burns the note so that Bruce will believe Rachel would have chosen him, reflecting that sometimes people need to believe that their faith will be rewarded, though in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, which is set eight years later, Alfred reveals the truth to a still-grieving Bruce in an attempt to get him to move on from Batman, which he eventually does by the end of the film beginning a relationship with Selina Kyle. Rachel is said to be loosely based on Julie Madison.

She later returns in the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; comic book universe in &quot;Mark of the Phantasm&quot;, where she is hired by Waller again to kill Jake Chill a.k.a Vigilante (the great-grandnephew of Joe Chill, who murdered Bruce&#x27;s parents) the man who murdered Terry&#x27;s father, Warren.

During the events of &quot;Arkham Asylum&quot;, after saving Dr. Young from the Joker&#x27;s goons and defeating Bane, Batman deduces that the Joker planned the assault on Arkham for months and that Young knew that Joker was using her research to create an army of super soldiers; her denial had forced the Joker to return to the Asylum. Fighting off the Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin, Batman destroys the remainder of Young&#x27;s Titan formula, but as Dr. Young arrives to the Warden&#x27;a office to recover the rest of the formula in a safe, she was held captive by serial killer Victor Zsasz. Batman manages to save her from Zsasz. As she attempts to recover the formula from the safe, she discovers it is booby-trapped, and an explosion occurs, killing Young in the process.

Avesta joined other Agency operatives in an attempt to capture the Riddler, wanting to impress Batman but was captured by the Riddler. Held in death traps, Riddler taunted and tortured the group until Batman arrived and rescued Avesta. When the trap&#x27;s floor began to heat up, Iman called for his help and before the fire systems were activated, Batman turned the wheel. She rushed out and tearfully hugged Batman, and began to thank him. Batman, although taken by surprise, still puts his arms around her to steady her in a comforting kind of way. His hands are around her back and he lets her steady herself for a moment and take some comfort that he’s there to save her but Riddler tries to force Batman into an unfair game, forcing him to solve riddles to save the other agents, but at the cost of Avesta&#x27;s hearing. Avesta urged Batman to save her comrades instead of herself, asking Batman to go along with the Riddler&#x27;s twisted game, so she can sacrifice her hearing even though it meant that she would likely die in the process. If Batman solved the riddles, Avesta distracts the criminal long enough for Batman to figure out a way to escape the cage. Avesta shows her gratitude but is rendered deaf, leading the vigilante to embrace her in comfort. Avesta would later wear hearing aids to restore her lost sense. It is later revealed that she already knew his true identity of Bruce Wayne, and had passed this information to Waller. She is later willing to work with him and give information about Waller&#x27;s most private of information.

After a trip to Africa, Batwing attracted the attention of the Marabunta, which swarmed the Fox home and attacked Tiffany&#x27;s family. This forced the family to relocate to a more public location until things could settle down. Eventually Russell Tavaroff wanted revenge on Batwing for a childhood incident and decided to join with Rat Catcher to kidnap Tiffany and her sister Tamara Fox. Tamara was eventually driven insane by the Rat Catcher, leaving Tiffany alone with him as bait to draw Batwing into the sewers below Gotham City. Tiffany fought her captors and escaped to the upper levels of the sewers where she found Batwing, who revealed himself to be her brother. Together they escaped to the hospital where they were reunited once again.

<text>The Royal Flush Gang is a group of supervillains appearing in DC Comics. The group, which debuted in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #43 (March 1966), use a playing card theme. Their code names are based on the cards needed to form a royal flush in poker: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten. Joker occasionally affiliates himself with the gang, but is not a consistent member. The group returned to battle the Justice League of America many times, and also appeared in other comics, including &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot;. The group has been described as &quot;some of the most original villains of their time&quot;.

The gang has also appeared in many animated television adaptations, including &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; in 1985, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; in 1999 and 2000, &quot;Justice League&quot; in 2003 and 2005, and &quot;&quot; in 2009 and 2010.

The Royal Flush Gang also made appearances in the live-action Arrowverse TV shows &quot;Arrow&quot; in 2012 and &quot;The Flash&quot; in 2015 and 2021. The comic book versions seen in the 2013 &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline were redesigned to follow the pattern set by their &quot;Arrow&quot; appearance.

==Publication history==
The Royal Flush Gang first appeared in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #43 in March 1966 under the leadership of Amos Fortune and were created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky.

==Fictional team history==
===First Gang: Clubs===

The original Royal Flush Gang was Professor Amos Fortune&#x27;s childhood gang. King was a man named Kerry, Queen was a woman named Queenie, Jack was an unnamed man, and Ten was a strongman named Thomas Dillon. With Fortune himself as Ace, they fought the Justice League on two occasions using Fortune&#x27;s luck-altering technology to realize the fortune-telling significance of playing cards.

After Fortune abandoned the Gang, a new Ace became the leader and they attempted to steal four paintings containing clues to a hidden treasure, but were thwarted by Joker&#x27;s manipulations. Most of them then abandoned their criminal careers, although Jack briefly joined the Secret Society of Super Villains as &quot;Hi-Jack&quot;.

Fortune&#x27;s gang wore costumes based on the suit of clubs, but when they fought the Joker, the second Ace convinced them to change them to the suit of spades.

In the pages of &quot;JLA Classified&quot;, it was revealed the original Royal Flush Gang (sans Fortune) reunited to fight the &quot;Detroit Era&quot; Justice League and their successors in the second gang. In this battle, the original King, Queen and Ten were all killed.

===Second Gang: Spades===
The second Royal Flush Gang was set up by Green Lantern villain Hector Hammond in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #203. Hammond led the group as &quot;Wildcard&quot;. This version wore costumes based on the suit of spades. The gang split up and went on to have separate criminal careers before re-establishing themselves, without Hammond. They were twice hired by Maxwell Lord as part of his manipulation of Justice League International. Later, they were reorganized and reoutfitted by a successor to the Gambler masquerading as the Joker.

The membership of this group consists of:

;King (Joe Carny): The so-called &quot;King of the Hoboes&quot;, Carny also suffered from lung disease. As Hammond&#x27;s agent, he wore a costume that technologically enhanced his charisma to the point of mind control. King later gains immortality from the Dominators&#x27; metagene bomb in &quot;Invasion!&quot;.

;Queen (Mona Taylor): Taylor was originally a Broadway star whose alcoholism destroyed her career. As Hammond&#x27;s agent, she wielded a sceptre that cast realistic illusions. After the Gambler reoutfitted the team, she began employing a wrist shooter that fires razor sharp spades.

;Jack (name unknown): Originally a gigolo, he became a fugitive after inadvertently killing a client while attempting to steal her jewelry. As Hammond&#x27;s agent, he wielded an energy sword. The Gambler replaced his left eye with a cybernetic laser weapon.

;Ten (Wanda Wayland): Wayland was a test pilot fired for refusing her employer&#x27;s sexual advances. As Hammond&#x27;s agent, she wore a costume with energy blasters in its gloves. She has enhanced reflexes, and carries explosive playing cards.

;Ace: The first Ace (&quot;Derek Reston&quot;) was an android resembling an African-American man. A second Ace (Ernie Clay) was recruited by King and used a strength-enhancing exoskeleton provided by the Gambler. In more recent appearances in &quot;Starman&quot; and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the team was once again employing the robot Ace.

King, Queen and Ten also have blaster-pistols. The Gang fly on hovering playing cards. In the Gang&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, Ten had organized runaways as &quot;Ten&#x27;s Little Indians&quot;, a gang of thieves dressed as the two through nine of spades and armed with bows and trick arrows.

===Third Gang: All Suits===
In the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Universe, there were multiple active, costumed members, some of whom derived their outfits and codenames from cards with pip values lower than ten. The Royal Flush Gang is now an organization that reaches across America, with cells in major cities. Instead of five members, each &quot;cell&quot; has fifty-two, split into four suits run by the &quot;court cards&quot;. The Aces of Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades are all androids. Each member has a playing card value, and those who rise or fall in the Gang&#x27;s esteem gain or lose a &quot;pip&quot;.

Notably, Stargirl&#x27;s father Sam Kurtis was a &quot;Two of Clubs&quot;; upon defeating him, she transitioned from the Star-Spangled Kid identity to Stargirl in &quot;JSA: All-Stars&quot;.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #2 (2005), the Joker tortures and kills the leadership of a local Spades cell of the Royal Flush Gang from an unspecified city, after being rejected by the Society for his &quot;instability&quot;. The King is the last one left alive and he mocks the Joker for being rejected. The Joker kills the King with an electrical blast to the face. The dead gang is left in the ruins of a casino.

A new version of the Royal Flush Gang appears in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (vol. 2) #35. This version is working under the authority of Amos Fortune, who is addressed by other members as &quot;Wild Card&quot;. In the following issue, Fortune gives a history of the gang. It seems to combine the first and third gangs&#x27; histories/characteristics, with Fortune indicating that he was always running the group in some capacity. Ace of Spades is a man named Ernest Clay, Jack of Spades was a replacement for one that was a former gigolo, King of Spades was Joe Carny again, Queen of Spades was Mona Taylor, Six of Spades is an unnamed woman, and Ten of Spades was Wanda Wayland again.

Another cell of the expanded version, this one stylized as a street gang, appear as members of the Society in &quot;Villains United&quot; and several of its tie-ins in other comics. Ace of Spades was an unnamed buff man in sunglasses, Jack of Spades was Deuce Canyard, King of Spades was an unnamed man in a crown and sunglasses, Queen of Spades is a woman in a ponytail and sunglasses, and Ten of Spades is an unnamed orange-haired woman in sunglasses. It is unclear what ties the third gang has or had—if any—to its predecessors and successors.

A branch of the Royal Flush Gang based in Las Vegas, Nevada appeared in &quot;Zatanna&quot; #4. Rather than using a playing card motif, each member of the Vegas branch is modeled after a member of the Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin. It is unclear if there are still 52 cells throughout the country, or 52 members in total. A lower ranked member mentions that there are four Queens, but Fortune states that the group is constantly growing.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. The Royal Flush Gang are seen engaging the Justice League. They consist of an Ace android, King of Spades, Queen of Spades, and Jack of Spades. With help from Technician, the Justice League defeated the Royal Flush Gang.

Another incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang appears in the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline as members of the Secret Society of Super Villains. The group consists of Ace of Spades, King of Spades, Jack of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, and Ten of Clubs.

Another incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang attacks Superman when his secret identity is exposed. None of their members&#x27; names are revealed.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called DC Rebirth, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to The New 52. The Royal Flush Gang are redesigned to resemble their &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; counterparts. They are among the many villains aiming to kill Batman to stop Two-Face from revealing information. They descend on KGBeast and ask him the location of Batman and Duke Thomas. KGBeast throws a bomb onto the bottom of their playing card, presumably to take out his rivals in stopping Batman. 

===Dawn of DC===
In the 2022-23 limited series &quot;Punchline: The Gotham Game&quot;, the Royal Flush Gang, consisting of the King and Queen of Hearts (married couple Rex and Regina Quintain), Jack, Ten and Bluff (son of the King and Queen of Diamonds), are taken over by Punchline and help her to manufacture and distribute her drug XO in Gotham.

==Other versions==
* Joseph Carny / King appears in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; as a member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s Mankind Liberation Front and Vandal Savage&#x27;s immortal protégé. Despite leaving the Royal Flush Gang, he carries a cigarette pack with playing card markings and speaks in metaphors drawn from card games.
* The Royal Flush Gang appear in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; as servants of Krona.

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animation====
* The Royal Flush Gang appears in &quot;The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians&quot; episode &quot;The Wild Cards&quot;, with King voiced by Eugene Williams, Queen by Arlene Golonka, Jack by Jerry Houser, and Ten by Lynne Moody. This version of the group were recruited by the Joker under the alias of Ace, who allied with Darkseid to create a dimensional warp from Earth to Apokolips. After Batman deduces the Joker&#x27;s identity and foils the plot, Ten defects while the Joker and the rest of the gang are captured.
* Three incarnations of the Royal Flush Gang appear in series set in the DC Animated Universe (DCAU).
** The first incarnation appears in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, with King voiced by George Lazenby, Queen by Amanda Donohoe in the first season and Sarah Douglas in all subsequent appearances, their son Jack by Scott Cleverdon in the first season and Nicholas Guest in the third season, and their daughter Melanie Walker / Ten by Olivia d&#x27;Abo, while Ace is silent. This futuristic version of the group is a multi-generational crime family who use high-tech, playing card-themed weapons and an android serving as Ace. Additionally, they previously encountered the original Batman, Bruce Wayne, who nearly succeeded in disbanding the gang&#x27;s predecessors. Throughout their appearances, the gang battle Wayne&#x27;s successor Terry McGinnis, who falls in love with Melanie and eventually motivates her to leave the group. Following this, the gang struggle to maintain their power and work with their employer Paxton Powers to assassinate Wayne, only to be thwarted by McGinnis. In the aftermath, Ace is destroyed, King and Queen are arrested, the former is revealed to have been pursuing an affair with Powers&#x27; secretary due to an inferiority complex stemming from being compared unfavorably to his late predecessor and father-in-law, and Melanie bails Jack out of jail and helps him get a job at the restaurant she works at.
** The second incarnation appears in the &quot;Justice League&quot; two-part episode &quot;Wild Cards&quot;, with King voiced by Scott Menville, Queen by Tara Strong, Jack by Greg Cipes, Ten by Khary Payton, and Ace by Hynden Walch. This version of the group are five Project Cadmus-trained, metahuman teenagers, with King possessing pyrokinesis, Queen metallokinesis, Jack elasticity, Ten superhuman strength, and Ace psionic abilities. The Joker finds them, turns them into his Royal Flush Gang, and pits them against the Justice League on live television while he secretly uses Ace to drive millions of viewers insane. After the Leaguers capture most of the gang, Batman discovers the Joker kept a collar that Ace&#x27;s government handlers used to control her as insurance against her. An enraged Ace subsequently puts him in a catatonic state before disappearing.
** The third incarnation appears in a flashback in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Epilogue&quot;, with Ace voiced again by Walch while the rest of the gang are silent. This version of the group was formed by a lonely and depressed Ace, who developed reality-warping powers. She used them to turn four random people into a new Royal Flush Gang to play with her, but they chose to abandon her and turned to crime. Their powers are puns based partially on their names: King is a massive head with small limbs resembling Egg Fu and Marvel Comics character MODOK who possesses a flying throne and eye beams; Queen was transformed from a man and given enhanced strength; Jack is a samurai transformed from a black man; and Ten is a woman with extendable whip-like hair evocative of Bo Derek&#x27;s character from &quot;10&quot;. While the Justice League battled the empowered criminals, Cadmus member Amanda Waller revealed that Ace was dying due to an aneurysm and a possible psychic backlash caused by her death could kill millions. Batman volunteered to kill her before that could happen and confronted her, but Ace knew he had no intent to do so. After briefly explaining her backstory to him, she asked him to keep her company until she died. Batman accepted. Ace&#x27;s peaceful death harmed no one, and restored the remaining gang members to normal.
* The Royal Flush Gang appear in &quot;&quot;, with Ace voiced by Diedrich Bader and Jack by Edoardo Ballerini while King and Queen are silent. This version of the gang are Old West bandits who oppose Jonah Hex and Cinnamon.
* The Royal Flush Gang appear in the &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; episode &quot;#AwesomeAuntAntiope&quot;.

====Live-action====
* Three incarnations of the Royal Flush Gang appear in series set in the Arrowverse:
** The first incarnation appears in the &quot;Arrow&quot; episode &quot;Legacies&quot;, with Derek Reston / King portrayed by Currie Graham, Kyle Reston / Ace by Kyle Schmid, Teddy Reston / Jack by Tom Stevens, and Derek&#x27;s unnamed wife / Queen by Sarah-Jane Redmond. This version of the group is a family of bank robbers who wear hockey masks marked with their respective playing card. Additionally, Derek previously worked for Queen Industries before its CEO Robert Queen outsourced jobs to China and the Reston family lost their home as a result. Feeling guilty, Robert&#x27;s son Oliver tries to persuade Derek to right his own wrongs, but is forced to stop the Restons when they attempt to rob another bank. In the ensuing confrontation, Derek is fatally shot while the rest of the family are arrested. During Derek&#x27;s final moments, Oliver reveals his secret identity to him to show the former that he always had his best interests at heart. Derek admits what he did was wrong and he should not have gotten his family involved before dying in Oliver&#x27;s arms.
** Two incarnations of the Royal Flush Gang appear in &quot;The Flash&quot;. The first make a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, consisting of unnamed, masked motorcycle thieves King, Queen, and Ace, who are swiftly apprehended by the Flash. The second appear in the eighth season, consisting of metahumans Mona Taylor / Queen (portrayed by Agam Darshi), the group&#x27;s leader with psychic abilities; King (portrayed by Ryan Jefferson Booth), who has super-strength; Jake Fox / Jack (portrayed by Eston Fung), who can shoot lasers from his eyes; and Wanda Wayland / Ten (portrayed by Megan Peta Hill), an expert hand-to-hand combatant.
* Sam Kurtis appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Geoff Stults. After disappearing in the pilot episode, he resurfaces in the episode &quot;Shining Knight&quot;, ostensibly to reconnect with his daughter Courtney Whitmore, though he secretly attempts to steal her locket and sell it off for money. However, her stepfather Pat Dugan realizes Kurtis&#x27; true intentions and confronts him, telling him to never return.

King wields an electric scepter while Queen wields cards she can throw with high strength and accuracy. After Vandal Savage secretly supplies them with their technology, the Royal Flush Gang battle the Justice League, unknowingly serving as a distraction for Mirror Master to infiltrate the Batcave on Savage&#x27;s behalf.

<text>Stephen Ross Gerber (; September 20, 1947 – February 10, 2008) was an American comic book writer and creator of the satiric Marvel Comics character Howard the Duck. Other works include &quot;Man-Thing&quot;, &quot;Omega the Unknown,&quot; &quot;Marvel Spotlight:&quot; &quot;Son of Satan&quot;, &quot;The Defenders,&quot; &quot;Marvel Presents:&quot; &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Foolkiller&quot;. Gerber often included lengthy text pages in the midst of comic book stories, such as in his graphic novel, &quot;Stewart the Rat&quot;. Gerber was posthumously inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2010.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Steve Gerber was born to a Jewish family in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Bernice Gerber, and one of four children, with siblings Jon, Michael, and Lisa. A letter from Steve Gerber of &quot;7014 Roberts Court, University City 30, Mo.&quot; was published in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #19 (Oct. 1963). Other letters from Steve Gerber appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #26 (April 1965) and &quot;Captain America&quot; #118 (October 1969). After corresponding with fellow youthful comics fans Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails, and starting one of the first comics fanzines, &quot;Headline&quot;, at age 13 or 14, Gerber attended college at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and St. Louis University, where he finished his communications degree.

===Career===
Gerber began work as a copywriter for a St. Louis advertising agency. During this time he wrote short stories, some of which, such as &quot;And the Birds Hummed Dirges,&quot; later appeared in &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot; during his stint as editor.

In early 1972, Gerber asked Thomas, by this time Marvel editor-in-chief, about writing comics; Thomas sent him a writer&#x27;s test – six pages of a &quot;Daredevil&quot; car-chase scene drawn by Gene Colan – which Gerber passed. He accepted a position as an associate editor and writer at Marvel Comics. Thomas said in 2007,

Gerber&#x27;s comics writing career at Marvel began with three comic books cover-dated December 1972: &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #11, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #158, and a collaboration with writer Carole Seuling on &quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot;. Gerber initially penned superhero stories for titles such as &quot;Daredevil&quot; (20 issues), &quot;Iron Man&quot; (three issues) and &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; (11 issues). Gerber penned anthological horror-fantasy stories for &quot;Creatures on the Loose&quot; (adaptations of Lin Carter&#x27;s Thongor), &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Chamber of Chills&quot; and &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; and humor pieces for &quot;Crazy Magazine&quot;, becoming editor of that satirical magazine for issues #11–14.

====The Man-Thing and Howard the Duck====
Gerber scripted one of his signature series, &quot;Man-Thing&quot;, about a swamp-monster empath, beginning in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #11 (Dec. 1972). On page 11 of that issue, he created the series&#x27; narrative tagline, used in captions: &quot;Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing&#x27;s touch!&quot; After issue #19 (Dec. 1973), Man-Thing received a solo title, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 – Oct. 1975), of which issue #1 was originally intended for &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #20. Gerber and Mayerik introduced the original Foolkiller in issue #3 (March 1974). In the final issue, Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing&#x27;s adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on.

With penciler Val Mayerik, Gerber created Howard the Duck as a secondary character in a Man-Thing story in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #19 and &quot;Man-Thing&quot; #1 (Dec. 1973 - Jan. 1974). Howard graduated to his own backup feature in &quot;Giant-Size Man-Thing&quot; #4-5, confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as Garko the Man-Frog and Bessie the Hellcow, before acquiring his own comic-book title with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #1 (Jan. 1976). Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series, penciled initially by Frank Brunner and shortly afterward by Gene Colan. The series gradually developed a substantial cult following, which Marvel helped to promote by Howard&#x27;s satiric entry into the 1976 U.S. presidential campaign under the auspices of the All-Night Party.

Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; syndicated comic strip from 1977 to 1978, initially scripted by Gerber and drawn by Colan then Mayerik and finally Alan Kupperberg. Gerber was replaced on the strip in mid-1978, by another comic book writer, Marv Wolfman, creating acrimony. Marvel&#x27;s then editor-in-chief, Jim Shooter, blamed Gerber&#x27;s chronic tardiness, saying the creative team was &quot;producing strips within six days of their publication dates,&quot; which he said caused several newspapers to drop the strip. Shooter added that while the syndicate threatened to drop the strip if a new writer were not brought in, &quot;Steve can tell you a good number of horror stories – and they&#x27;re all true – about the trouble we had getting artists.&quot;

====Other comics work====
Gerber often collaborated with writer Mary Skrenes during this period. Among other Marvel projects, Gerber, Skrenes, and artist Jim Mooney created &quot;Omega the Unknown&quot;, which explored the strange link between a cosmic superhero and a boy, and wrote the first issue of &quot;Marvel Comics Super Special&quot; featuring the rock band KISS. He created the characters Starhawk, Aleta Ogord, and (with Skrenes) Nikki. He scripted the adventures of Daimon Hellstrom, Morbius, and Lilith.

Gerber often revived forgotten characters. In &quot;The Defenders,&quot; he revived three pre-superhero-era characters, the Headmen. He reintroduced the 1969 one-time feature &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, first as guest stars in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; and &quot;The Defenders&quot;, then as a feature in &quot;Marvel Presents&quot;.

Toward the end of his work at Marvel, he wrote Hanna-Barbera stories for Mark Evanier under the anagrammatic pseudonym Reg Everbest. Only two of these, featuring Magilla Gorilla and the Clue Club, were published in English.

====Battle for Howard the Duck====
In the first half of 1978, Gerber was fired from first the newspaper strip and then the comic book series for failure to meet deadlines. On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel&#x27;s efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent Cadence Industries and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character.

====DC work====
During the mid-1970s and early 1980s, Gerber worked for DC Comics, including an issue of &quot;Metal Men&quot;, the last three issues of &quot;Mister Miracle&quot;, &quot;The Phantom Zone&quot; limited series, and a run of &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; backup stories in &quot;The Flash&quot; co-written with Martin Pasko. Gerber had planned to write for DC&#x27;s &quot;Time Warp&quot; science fiction anthology series, but objected to the submission guidelines for that series. Gerber wrote for independent comic companies. One of Gerber&#x27;s first major works away from Marvel was the original graphic novel &quot;Stewart the Rat&quot; for Eclipse Comics, with art by Gene Colan and Tom Palmer. For &quot;Eclipse Magazine,&quot; Gerber and Mayerik created the anti-censorship horror story, &quot;Role Model/Caring, Sharing, and Helping Others&quot;.

====Resolution of the court case====
In 1981 he teamed with Jack Kirby at Eclipse to create &quot;Destroyer Duck&quot;, a satirical comic created to raise funds for his court case against Marvel.

The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982. Gerber acknowledged that his work on the character had been done as work-for-hire and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned &quot;all right, title and interest&quot; to Howard the Duck and related material. On November 5, 1982, Judge David Kenyon approved the motion and dismissed the case.

====1980s and 1990s career====
In the early 1980s, Gerber and Frank Miller made a joint proposal to revamp DC&#x27;s three biggest characters, namely Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman;. The proposal was not accepted.

After Marvel had cancelled his contract in May 1978, he returned to Marvel in 1983 with the short-lived &quot;Void Indigo&quot;.

Gerber was slated to write a new &quot;Spectre&quot; series in 1986, but he missed the deadline for the first issue so that he could watch the last day of shooting on the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; film and DC assigned another writer to the series in response.

Gerber scripted assorted projects for Marvel, including the controversial creator-owned book &quot;Void Indigo&quot; (1984) for Epic Comics, a serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; (Sept. 1988–Feb. 1989), &quot;The Legion of Night&quot; and the 1991 &quot;Suburban Jersey Ninja She-Devils&quot; one-shot issue. For DC, his works include &quot;A. Bizarro&quot;. At Marvel, Gerber scripted a 12-issue run on &quot;The Sensational She-Hulk&quot; (which featured Howard the Duck). He also scripted three issues of &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;, a Hawkeye story in &quot;Avengers Spotlight&quot;, and two issues of &quot;Toxic Crusaders&quot;. During this time he did a serial in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; featuring Poison, a character he had created in &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot; crossover. He scripted a &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; black and white magazine format comic book which detailed the backstory of the character of Freddy Krueger.

====Television work====
In collaboration with Beth Woods (later Slick), Gerber wrote the &quot;Contagion&quot; episode of the syndicated television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

Gerber&#x27;s work in television animation included story editor duties on &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;; creating &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;; and sharing a 1998 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class – Animated Program, for the WB program &quot;The New Batman/Superman Adventures&quot;.

====Ultraverse====
He was one of the founders of the Malibu Comics superhero setting the Ultraverse and co-created &quot;Sludge&quot; and &quot;Exiles&quot;. For Image Comics, he co-created &quot;The Cybernary&quot; with Nick Manabat and disbanded &quot;&quot;, in addition to guest-writing &quot;Pitt&quot;.

====2000s work====
In 2002, he created a new &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; miniseries for Marvel&#x27;s MAX line. For DC, he created &quot;Nevada&quot; for the Vertigo imprint in 1998 with artist Phil Winslade and &quot;Hard Time&quot; with long-time collaborator Mary Skrenes, which outlasted the short-lived imprint DC Focus, but slow sales led &quot;Hard Time: Season Two&quot; to be cancelled after only seven issues.

Later, Gerber wrote the &quot;Helmet of Fate: Zauriel&quot; one-shot and continued writing the Doctor Fate serial in the &quot;Countdown to Mystery&quot; limited series for DC Comics up to the time of his death, working on stories in the hospital. Gerber died before being able to write the concluding chapter of the serial; in his honor, four separate writers (Adam Beechen, Mark Evanier, Gail Simone, and Mark Waid) provided their own conclusions to the story.

In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Gerber&#x27;s run on &quot;The Defenders&quot; first on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;, while &quot;Omega the Unknown&quot; was 10th on the same list.

Gerber&#x27;s posthumous Man-Thing story &quot;The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man&quot;, with art by Kevin Nowlan, originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist, was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled &quot;The Infernal Man-Thing&quot; (early Sept.-Oct. 2012). The story was a sequel to Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man&quot; in &quot;Man-Thing&quot; #12 (Dec. 1974).

===Death===
In 2007, Gerber was diagnosed with an early stage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and was eventually hospitalized while continuing to work. He had gotten onto the waiting list for a lung transplant at UCLA Medical Center. On February 10, 2008, Gerber died in a Las Vegas hospital from complications stemming from his condition. His final comics work was writing &quot;Countdown to Mystery: Doctor Fate&quot; for DC Comics, having briefly worked with a version of the character in 1982.

At the time of his death, Gerber was separated from his wife, Margo Macleod. He had a daughter, Samantha Gerber.

==In fiction==

One of Gerber&#x27;s working pen-names, Reg Everbest, was the inspiration behind the first Foolkiller&#x27;s real name, which was revealed as Ross G. Everbest. Gerber used the anagrammatic Reg Everbest pseudonym for Marvel-published Hanna-Barbera stories after he was banned from Marvel by Jim Shooter. Roger Stern named the original, deceased Foolkiller &quot;Ross G. Everbest&quot; in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #225, in homage to Gerber, using Gerber&#x27;s middle name as the character&#x27;s first name, the middle initial restoring the anagram save for a silent e. The character&#x27;s real name never appeared in the two Gerber stories, but is seen on a computer screen in the second Foolkiller&#x27;s van, next to the face of the original user of that identity.

The Marvel Universe villain Thundersword (by Jim Shooter, Al Milgrom and Steve Leialoha) is considered a parody of Gerber and his creation Thundarr the Barbarian.
Stewart Cadwall is a TV scriptwriter who acquires superpowers, becomes Thundersword and fights the current state of the media.

<text>Hans Leo Hassler (in German, Hans Leo Haßler) (baptised 26 October 1564 – 8 June 1612) was a German composer and organist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, elder brother of lesser known composer Jakob Hassler. He was born in Nürnberg and died in Frankfurt.

== Biography ==

Hassler was born in Nürnberg and baptised on 26 October 1564, receiving his first instruction in music from his father, the organist Isaak Hassler. In 1584, Hassler became the first of many German composers of the time who went to Italy to continue their studies; he arrived in Venice during the peak of activity of the Venetian school, the composers who wrote in the resplendent polychoral style, which was soon to become popular outside its native city. Hassler was already familiar with some of this music, as numerous prints had circulated in Germany due to the interest of Leonhard Lechner, who was associated with Orlandus Lassus in Munich.

While in Venice, Hassler became friends with Giovanni Gabrieli, with whom he composed a wedding motet for Georg Gruber, a Nuremberg merchant living in Venice, in 1600. Together they studied with Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni&#x27;s uncle. Under Andrea, Hassler received instruction in composition and organ playing.

Following Andrea Gabrieli&#x27;s death, Hassler returned to Germany in the latter part of 1585, moving to Augsburg where he served as an organist to Octavian II Fugger, a nobleman there. The Augsburg years were extremely creative for him; in addition he became well known as a composer and organist at this time, though his influence was limited because he was a Protestant in an area which was still heavily Catholic.

Hassler was not only a composer, but also an active organist and a consultant to organ builders. In 1596, Hassler, along with 53 other organists, was given the opportunity to examine a new instrument with 59 stops at the Schlosskirche, Groningen. Hassler was continually recognized for his expertise in organ design, and was often called upon as the examiner of new instruments. Using his extensive organ background, Hassler stepped into the world of mechanical instrument construction and developed a clockwork organ that was later sold to Emperor Rudolf II.

In 1602, Hassler returned to Nürnberg where he became the &quot;Kapellmeister,&quot; or director of town music. While there, he was appointed &quot;Kaiserlicher Hofdiener&quot; in the court of Rudolf II. In 1604, he took a leave of absence and traveled to Ulm, where he was wed to Cordula Claus. Four years later, Hassler moved to Dresden where he served as the electoral chamber organist to the Elector Christian II of Saxony, and eventually as &quot;Kapellmeister.&quot; By this time, Hassler had already developed the tuberculosis that would claim his life in June 1612. After he died, Michael Praetorius and Heinrich Schütz were appointed in his place.

== Style ==
Hassler was one of the first to bring the innovations of the Venetian style across the Alps. Through his songs, “in the manner of foreign madrigal and canzonets,” and the &quot;Lustgarten&quot;, Hassler brought to Germany the &quot;villanelle&quot;, &quot;canzonette&quot;, and dance songs of Gastoldi and Orazio Vecchi. As the first great German composer to undertake an “Italian Journey,” Hassler&#x27;s influence was one of the reasons for the Italian domination over German music and for the common trend of German musicians finishing their education in Italy. While musicians of the stature of Lassus had been working in Germany for years, they represented the older school, the &quot;prima pratica&quot;, the fully developed and refined Renaissance style of polyphony; in Italy new trends were emerging which were to define what was later called the Baroque era. Musicians such as Hassler, and later Schütz, carried the concertato style, the polychoral idea, and the freely emotional expression of the Venetians into the German culture, creating the first and most important Baroque development outside of Italy.

Though Hassler was Protestant, he wrote many masses and directed the music for Catholic masses in Augsburg. While in the service of Octavian Fugger, Hassler dedicated both his &quot;Cantiones sacrae&quot; and a book of masses for four to eight voices to him. Due to the demands of the Catholic patrons, and his own Protestant beliefs, Hassler&#x27;s compositions represented a skillful blend of both religions’ music styles that allowed his compositions to function in both contexts. Thus, many of Hassler&#x27;s works could be used both in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran. During his time in Augsburg, Hassler only produced two works that were specifically meant for the Lutheran church. Under the commission of the free city of Nuremberg, the &quot;Psalmen simpliciter&quot; was composed in 1608, and was dedicated to the city. Hassler also produced the &quot;Psalmen und christliche Gesänge, mit vier Stimmen auf die Melodeien fugweis komponiert&quot; in 1607 and dedicated it to Elector Christian II of Saxony. Stylistically, Hassler&#x27;s early works exhibit reflections of the influence of Lassus, while his later works are marked by the impressions left on him by his studies in Italy. After returning from Italy, Hassler incorporated polychoral techniques, textural contrasts and occasional chromaticism in his compositions. His later masses were characterized by light melodies juxtaposed with the grace and fluidity of the madrigalian dance songs; thus creating a charming sacred style that was more sonorous than it was profound. His secular music—madrigals, canzonette, and songs among the vocal, and ricercars, canzonas, introits and toccatas among the instrumental—show many of the advanced techniques of the Gabrielis in Italy, but with a somewhat more restrained character, and always attentive to craftsmanship and beauty of sound. However, Hassler&#x27;s greatest success in combining the German and Italian compositional styles existed in his &quot;lieder.&quot; In 1590, Hassler released his first publication, a set of twenty-four, four-part &quot;canzonette&quot;. The &quot;Lustgarten neuer teutscher Gesang, Balletti, Galliarden und Intraden&quot;, which contains thirty-nine vocal and eleven instrumental pieces, is Hassler&#x27;s most renowned collection of &quot;lieder.&quot; Within this work, Hassler published dance collections for four, five, or six string or wind instruments with voice and without continuo. He also composed &quot;Mein G&#x27;müt ist mir verwirret&quot;, a five-part piece. Its melody was later combined with the text &quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot; of Paul Gerhardt, in which form it was used by Bach in his St Matthew Passion. Bach also employed the melody as a counterpoint to the aria &quot;Komm, du süße Todesstunde&quot; in Cantata 161 and used it once again as the final chorale in that same cantata.

Along with many of his contemporaries, Hassler sought to blend the Italian virtuoso style with the traditional style prevalent in Germany. This was accomplished in the chorale motet by employing the thorough bass continuo and including instrumental and solo ornamentation. Hassler&#x27;s motets exhibit this blend of the old and the new in the way they reflect both the influence of Lassus and the two four-part chorus style of the Gabrielis.

Hassler is considered to be one of the most important German composers of all time. His use of the innovative Italian techniques, coupled with traditional, conservative German techniques allowed his compositions to be fresh without the modern affective tone. His songs presented a combined vocal and instrumental literature that did not make use of the continuo, or only provided it as an option, and his sacred music introduced the Italian polychoral structures that would later influence many composers leading into the Baroque era.
