<text>Learning classifier systems, or LCS, are a paradigm of rule-based machine learning methods that combine a discovery component (e.g. typically a genetic algorithm in evolutionary computation) with a learning component (performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning). Learning classifier systems seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions (e.g. behavior modeling, classification, data mining, regression, function approximation, or game strategy). This approach allows complex solution spaces to be broken up into smaller, simpler parts for the reinforcement learning that is inside artificial intelligence research.

The founding concepts behind learning classifier systems came from attempts to model complex adaptive systems, using rule-based agents to form an artificial cognitive system (i.e. artificial intelligence).

== Methodology ==
The architecture and components of a given learning classifier system can be quite variable. It is useful to think of an LCS as a machine consisting of several interacting components. Components may be added or removed, or existing components modified/exchanged to suit the demands of a given problem domain (like algorithmic building blocks) or to make the algorithm flexible enough to function in many different problem domains. As a result, the LCS paradigm can be flexibly applied to many problem domains that call for machine learning. The major divisions among LCS implementations are as follows: (1) Michigan-style architecture vs. Pittsburgh-style architecture, (2) reinforcement learning vs. supervised learning, (3) incremental learning vs. batch learning, (4) online learning vs. offline learning, (5) strength-based fitness vs. accuracy-based fitness, and (6) complete action mapping vs best action mapping. These divisions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, XCS, the best known and best studied LCS algorithm, is Michigan-style, was designed for reinforcement learning but can also perform supervised learning, applies incremental learning that can be either online or offline, applies accuracy-based fitness, and seeks to generate a complete action mapping.

=== Elements of a generic LCS algorithm ===

Keeping in mind that LCS is a paradigm for genetic-based machine learning rather than a specific method, the following outlines key elements of a generic, modern (i.e. post-XCS) LCS algorithm. For simplicity let us focus on Michigan-style architecture with supervised learning. See the illustrations on the right laying out the sequential steps involved in this type of generic LCS.

==== Environment ====
The environment is the source of data upon which an LCS learns. It can be an offline, finite training dataset (characteristic of a data mining, classification, or regression problem), or an online sequential stream of live training instances. Each training instance is assumed to include some number of &quot;features&quot; (also referred to as &quot;attributes&quot;, or &quot;independent variables&quot;), and a single &quot;endpoint&quot; of interest (also referred to as the class, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;phenotype&quot;, &quot;prediction&quot;, or &quot;dependent variable&quot;). Part of LCS learning can involve feature selection, therefore not all of the features in the training data need to be informative. The set of feature values of an instance is commonly referred to as the &quot;state&quot;. For simplicity let&#x27;s assume an example problem domain with Boolean/binary features and a Boolean/binary class. For Michigan-style systems, one instance from the environment is trained on each learning cycle (i.e. incremental learning). Pittsburgh-style systems perform batch learning, where rule sets are evaluated in each iteration over much or all of the training data.

==== Rule/classifier/population ====
A rule is a context dependent relationship between state values and some prediction. Rules typically take the form of an {IF:THEN} expression, (e.g. {&quot;IF &#x27;condition&#x27; THEN &#x27;action&#x27;},&quot; or as a more specific example, &quot;{IF &#x27;red&#x27; AND &#x27;octagon&#x27; THEN &#x27;stop-sign&#x27;}&quot;). A critical concept in LCS and rule-based machine learning alike, is that an individual rule is not in itself a model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Think of a rule as a &quot;local-model&quot; of the solution space.

Rules can be represented in many different ways to handle different data types (e.g. binary, discrete-valued, ordinal, continuous-valued). Given binary data LCS traditionally applies a ternary rule representation (i.e. rules can include either a 0, 1, or &#x27;#&#x27; for each feature in the data). The &#x27;don&#x27;t care&#x27; symbol (i.e. &#x27;#&#x27;) serves as a wild card within a rule&#x27;s condition allowing rules, and the system as a whole to generalize relationships between features and the target endpoint to be predicted. Consider the following rule (#1###0 ~ 1) (i.e. condition ~ action). This rule can be interpreted as: IF the second feature = 1 AND the sixth feature = 0 THEN the class prediction = 1. We would say that the second and sixth features were specified in this rule, while the others were generalized. This rule, and the corresponding prediction are only applicable to an instance when the condition of the rule is satisfied by the instance. This is more commonly referred to as matching. In Michigan-style LCS, each rule has its own fitness, as well as a number of other rule-parameters associated with it that can describe the number of copies of that rule that exist (i.e. the &quot;numerosity&quot;), the age of the rule, its accuracy, or the accuracy of its reward predictions, and other descriptive or experiential statistics. A rule along with its parameters is often referred to as a &quot;classifier&quot;. In Michigan-style systems, classifiers are contained within a &quot;population&quot; [P] that has a user defined maximum number of classifiers. Unlike most stochastic search algorithms (e.g. evolutionary algorithms), LCS populations start out empty (i.e. there is no need to randomly initialize a rule population). Classifiers will instead be initially introduced to the population with a covering mechanism.

In any LCS, the trained model is a set of rules/classifiers, rather than any single rule/classifier. In Michigan-style LCS, the entire trained (and optionally, compacted) classifier population forms the prediction model.

==== Matching ====
One of the most critical and often time-consuming elements of an LCS is the matching process. The first step in an LCS learning cycle takes a single training instance from the environment and passes it to [P] where matching takes place. In step two, every rule in [P] is now compared to the training instance to see which rules match (i.e. are contextually relevant to the current instance). In step three, any matching rules are moved to a &quot;match set&quot; [M]. A rule matches a training instance if all feature values specified in the rule condition are equivalent to the corresponding feature value in the training instance. For example, assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), these rules would match: (###0## ~ 0), (00###1 ~ 0), (#01001 ~ 1), but these rules would not (1##### ~ 0), (000##1 ~ 0), (#0#1#0 ~ 1). Notice that in matching, the endpoint/action specified by the rule is not taken into consideration. As a result, the match set may contain classifiers that propose conflicting actions. In the fourth step, since we are performing supervised learning, [M] is divided into a correct set [C] and an incorrect set [I]. A matching rule goes into the correct set if it proposes the correct action (based on the known action of the training instance), otherwise it goes into [I]. In reinforcement learning LCS, an action set [A] would be formed here instead, since the correct action is not known.

==== Covering ====
At this point in the learning cycle, if no classifiers made it into either [M] or [C] (as would be the case when the population starts off empty), the covering mechanism is applied (fifth step). Covering is a form of &quot;online smart population initialization&quot;. Covering randomly generates a rule that matches the current training instance (and in the case of supervised learning, that rule is also generated with the correct action. Assuming the training instance is (001001 ~ 0), covering might generate any of the following rules: (#0#0## ~ 0), (001001 ~ 0), (#010## ~ 0). Covering not only ensures that each learning cycle there is at least one correct, matching rule in [C], but that any rule initialized into the population will match at least one training instance. This prevents LCS from exploring the search space of rules that do not match any training instances.

==== Parameter updates/credit assignment/learning ====
In the sixth step, the rule parameters of any rule in [M] are updated to reflect the new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched. Rule accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of times the rule was in a correct set [C] by the number of times it was in a match set [M]. Rule accuracy can be thought of as a &#x27;local accuracy&#x27;. Rule fitness is also updated here, and is commonly calculated as a function of rule accuracy. The concept of fitness is taken directly from classic genetic algorithms. Be aware that there are many variations on how LCS updates parameters in order to perform credit assignment and learning.

==== Subsumption ====
In the seventh step, a &quot;subsumption&quot; mechanism is typically applied. Subsumption is an explicit generalization mechanism that merges classifiers that cover redundant parts of the problem space. The subsuming classifier effectively absorbs the subsumed classifier (and has its numerosity increased). This can only happen when the subsuming classifier is more general, just as accurate, and covers all of the problem space of the classifier it subsumes.

==== Rule discovery/genetic algorithm ====
In the eighth step, LCS adopts a highly elitist genetic algorithm (GA) which will select two parent classifiers based on fitness (survival of the fittest). Parents are selected from [C] typically using tournament selection. Some systems have applied roulette wheel selection or deterministic selection, and have differently selected parent rules from either [P] - panmictic selection, or from [M]). Crossover and mutation operators are now applied to generate two new offspring rules. At this point, both the parent and offspring rules are returned to [P]. The LCS genetic algorithm is highly elitist since each learning iteration, the vast majority of the population is preserved. Rule discovery may alternatively be performed by some other method, such as an estimation of distribution algorithm, but a GA is by far the most common approach. Evolutionary algorithms like the GA employ a stochastic search, which makes LCS a stochastic algorithm. LCS seeks to cleverly explore the search space, but does not perform an exhaustive search of rule combinations, and is not guaranteed to converge on an optimal solution.

==== Deletion ====
The last step in a generic LCS learning cycle is to maintain the maximum population size. The deletion mechanism will select classifiers for deletion (commonly using roulette wheel selection). The probability of a classifier being selected for deletion is inversely proportional to its fitness. When a classifier is selected for deletion, its numerosity parameter is reduced by one. When the numerosity of a classifier is reduced to zero, it is removed entirely from the population.

==== Training ====
LCS will cycle through these steps repeatedly for some user defined number of training iterations, or until some user defined termination criteria have been met. For online learning, LCS will obtain a completely new training instance each iteration from the environment. For offline learning, LCS will iterate through a finite training dataset. Once it reaches the last instance in the dataset, it will go back to the first instance and cycle through the dataset again.

==== Rule compaction ====
Once training is complete, the rule population will inevitably contain some poor, redundant and inexperienced rules. It is common to apply a &quot;rule compaction&quot;, or &quot;condensation&quot; heuristic as a post-processing step. This resulting compacted rule population is ready to be applied as a prediction model (e.g. make predictions on testing instances), and/or to be interpreted for knowledge discovery.

==== Prediction ====
Whether or not rule compaction has been applied, the output of an LCS algorithm is a population of classifiers which can be applied to making predictions on previously unseen instances. The prediction mechanism is not part of the supervised LCS learning cycle itself, however it would play an important role in a reinforcement learning LCS learning cycle. For now we consider how the prediction mechanism can be applied for making predictions to test data. When making predictions, the LCS learning components are deactivated so that the population does not continue to learn from incoming testing data. A test instance is passed to [P] where a match set [M] is formed as usual. At this point the match set is differently passed to a prediction array. Rules in the match set can predict different actions, therefore a voting scheme is applied. In a simple voting scheme, the action with the strongest supporting &#x27;votes&#x27; from matching rules wins, and becomes the selected prediction. All rules do not get an equal vote. Rather the strength of the vote for a single rule is commonly proportional to its numerosity and fitness. This voting scheme and the nature of how LCS&#x27;s store knowledge, suggests that LCS algorithms are implicitly &quot;ensemble learners&quot;.

==== Interpretation ====
Individual LCS rules are typically human readable IF:THEN expression. Rules that constitute the LCS prediction model can be ranked by different rule parameters and manually inspected. Global strategies to guide knowledge discovery using statistical and graphical have also been proposed. With respect to other advanced machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, random forests, or genetic programming, learning classifier systems are particularly well suited to problems that require interpretable solutions.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
John Henry Holland was best known for his work popularizing genetic algorithms (GA), through his ground-breaking book &quot;Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems&quot; in 1975 and his formalization of Holland&#x27;s schema theorem. In 1976, Holland conceptualized an extension of the GA concept to what he called a &quot;cognitive system&quot;, and provided the first detailed description of what would become known as the first learning classifier system in the paper &quot;Cognitive Systems based on Adaptive Algorithms&quot;. This first system, named Cognitive System One (CS-1) was conceived as a modeling tool, designed to model a real system (i.e. &quot;environment&quot;) with unknown underlying dynamics using a population of human readable rules. The goal was for a set of rules to perform online machine learning to adapt to the environment based on infrequent payoff/reward (i.e. reinforcement learning) and apply these rules to generate a behavior that matched the real system. This early, ambitious implementation was later regarded as overly complex, yielding inconsistent results.

Beginning in 1980, Kenneth de Jong and his student Stephen Smith took a different approach to rule-based machine learning with (LS-1), where learning was viewed as an offline optimization process rather than an online adaptation process. This new approach was more similar to a standard genetic algorithm but evolved independent sets of rules. Since that time LCS methods inspired by the online learning framework introduced by Holland at the University of Michigan have been referred to as Michigan-style LCS, and those inspired by Smith and De Jong at the University of Pittsburgh have been referred to as Pittsburgh-style LCS. In 1986, Holland developed what would be considered the standard Michigan-style LCS for the next decade.

Other important concepts that emerged in the early days of LCS research included (1) the formalization of a &quot;bucket brigade algorithm&quot; (BBA) for credit assignment/learning, (2) selection of parent rules from a common &#x27;environmental niche&#x27; (i.e. the &quot;match set&quot; [M]) rather than from the whole &quot;population&quot; [P], (3) &quot;covering&quot;, first introduced as a &quot;create&quot; operator, (4) the formalization of an &quot;action set&quot; [A], (5) a simplified algorithm architecture, (6) &quot;strength-based fitness&quot;, (7) consideration of single-step, or supervised learning problems and the introduction of the &quot;correct set&quot; [C], (8) &quot;accuracy-based fitness&quot; (9) the combination of fuzzy logic with LCS (which later spawned a lineage of &quot;fuzzy LCS algorithms&quot;), (10) encouraging &quot;long action chains&quot; and &quot;default hierarchies&quot; for improving performance on multi-step problems, (11) examining latent learning (which later inspired a new branch of &quot;anticipatory classifier systems&quot; (ACS)), and (12) the introduction of the first Q-learning-like credit assignment technique. While not all of these concepts are applied in modern LCS algorithms, each were landmarks in the development of the LCS paradigm.

=== The revolution ===
Interest in learning classifier systems was reinvigorated in the mid 1990s largely due to two events; the development of the Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning, and the introduction of significantly simplified Michigan-style LCS architectures by Stewart Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s Zeroth-level Classifier System (ZCS) focused on increasing algorithmic understandability based on Hollands standard LCS implementation. This was done, in part, by removing rule-bidding and the internal message list, essential to the original BBA credit assignment, and replacing it with a hybrid BBA/Q-Learning strategy. ZCS demonstrated that a much simpler LCS architecture could perform as well as the original, more complex implementations. However, ZCS still suffered from performance drawbacks including the proliferation of over-general classifiers.

In 1995, Wilson published his landmark paper, &quot;Classifier fitness based on accuracy&quot; in which he introduced the classifier system XCS. XCS took the simplified architecture of ZCS and added an accuracy-based fitness, a niche GA (acting in the action set [A]), an explicit generalization mechanism called &quot;subsumption&quot;, and an adaptation of the Q-Learning credit assignment. XCS was popularized by its ability to reach optimal performance while evolving accurate and maximally general classifiers as well as its impressive problem flexibility (able to perform both reinforcement learning and supervised learning). XCS later became the best known and most studied LCS algorithm and defined a new family of &quot;accuracy-based LCS&quot;. ZCS alternatively became synonymous with &quot;strength-based LCS&quot;. XCS is also important, because it successfully bridged the gap between LCS and the field of reinforcement learning. Following the success of XCS, LCS were later described as reinforcement learning systems endowed with a generalization capability. Reinforcement learning typically seeks to learn a value function that maps out a complete representation of the state/action space. Similarly, the design of XCS drives it to form an all-inclusive and accurate representation of the problem space (i.e. a &quot;complete map&quot;) rather than focusing on high payoff niches in the environment (as was the case with strength-based LCS). Conceptually, complete maps don&#x27;t only capture what you should do, or what is correct, but also what you shouldn&#x27;t do, or what&#x27;s incorrect. Differently, most strength-based LCSs, or exclusively supervised learning LCSs seek a rule set of efficient generalizations in the form of a &quot;best action map&quot; (or a &quot;partial map&quot;). Comparisons between strength vs. accuracy-based fitness and complete vs. best action maps have since been examined in greater detail.

=== In the wake of XCS ===
XCS inspired the development of a whole new generation of LCS algorithms and applications. In 1995, Congdon was the first to apply LCS to real-world epidemiological investigations of disease followed closely by Holmes who developed the BOOLE++, EpiCS, and later EpiXCS for epidemiological classification. These early works inspired later interest in applying LCS algorithms to complex and large-scale data mining tasks epitomized by bioinformatics applications. In 1998, Stolzmann introduced anticipatory classifier systems (ACS) which included rules in the form of &#x27;condition-action-effect, rather than the classic &#x27;condition-action&#x27; representation. ACS was designed to predict the perceptual consequences of an action in all possible situations in an environment. In other words, the system evolves a model that specifies not only what to do in a given situation, but also provides information of what will happen after a specific action will be executed. This family of LCS algorithms is best suited to multi-step problems, planning, speeding up learning, or disambiguating perceptual aliasing (i.e. where the same observation is obtained in distinct states but requires different actions). Butz later pursued this anticipatory family of LCS developing a number of improvements to the original method. In 2002, Wilson introduced XCSF, adding a computed action in order to perform function approximation. In 2003, Bernado-Mansilla introduced a sUpervised Classifier System (UCS), which specialized the XCS algorithm to the task of supervised learning, single-step problems, and forming a best action set. UCS removed the reinforcement learning strategy in favor of a simple, accuracy-based rule fitness as well as the explore/exploit learning phases, characteristic of many reinforcement learners. Bull introduced a simple accuracy-based LCS (YCS) and a simple strength-based LCS Minimal Classifier System (MCS) in order to develop a better theoretical understanding of the LCS framework. Bacardit introduced GAssist and BioHEL, Pittsburgh-style LCSs designed for data mining and scalability to large datasets in bioinformatics applications. In 2008, Drugowitsch published the book titled &quot;Design and Analysis of Learning Classifier Systems&quot; including some theoretical examination of LCS algorithms. Butz introduced the first rule online learning visualization within a GUI for XCSF (see the image at the top of this page). Urbanowicz extended the UCS framework and introduced ExSTraCS, explicitly designed for supervised learning in noisy problem domains (e.g. epidemiology and bioinformatics). ExSTraCS integrated (1) expert knowledge to drive covering and genetic algorithm towards important features in the data, (2) a form of long-term memory referred to as attribute tracking, allowing for more efficient learning and the characterization of heterogeneous data patterns, and (3) a flexible rule representation similar to Bacardit&#x27;s mixed discrete-continuous attribute list representation. Both Bacardit and Urbanowicz explored statistical and visualization strategies to interpret LCS rules and perform knowledge discovery for data mining. Browne and Iqbal explored the concept of reusing building blocks in the form of code fragments and were the first to solve the 135-bit multiplexer benchmark problem by first learning useful building blocks from simpler multiplexer problems. ExSTraCS 2.0 was later introduced to improve Michigan-style LCS scalability, successfully solving the 135-bit multiplexer benchmark problem for the first time directly. The n-bit multiplexer problem is highly epistatic and heterogeneous, making it a very challenging machine learning task.

== Variants ==

=== Michigan-Style Learning Classifier System ===
Michigan-Style LCSs are characterized by a population of rules where the genetic algorithm operates at the level of individual rules and the solution is represented by the entire rule population. Michigan style systems also learn incrementally which allows them to perform both reinforcement learning and supervised learning, as well as both online and offline learning. Michigan-style systems have the advantage of being applicable to a greater number of problem domains, and the unique benefits of incremental learning.

=== Pittsburgh-Style Learning Classifier System ===
Pittsburgh-Style LCSs are characterized by a population of variable length rule-sets where each rule-set is a potential solution. The genetic algorithm typically operates at the level of an entire rule-set. Pittsburgh-style systems can also uniquely evolve ordered rule lists, as well as employ a default rule. These systems have the natural advantage of identifying smaller rule sets, making these systems more interpretable with regards to manual rule inspection.

=== Hybrid systems ===
Systems that seek to combine key strengths of both systems have also been proposed.

== Advantages ==
* Adaptive: They can acclimate to a changing environment in the case of online learning.
* Model free: They make limited assumptions about the environment, or the patterns of association within the data.
** They can model complex, epistatic, heterogeneous, or distributed underlying patterns without relying on prior knowledge.
** They make no assumptions about the number of predictive vs. non-predictive features in the data.
* Ensemble Learner: No single model is applied to a given instance that universally provides a prediction. Instead a relevant and often conflicting set of rules contribute a &#x27;vote&#x27; which can be interpreted as a fuzzy prediction.
* Stochastic Learner: Non-deterministic learning is advantageous in large-scale or high complexity problems where deterministic or exhaustive learning becomes intractable.
* Implicitly Multi-objective: Rules evolve towards accuracy with implicit and explicit pressures encouraging maximal generality/simplicity. This implicit generalization pressure is unique to LCS. Effectively, more general rules, will appear more often in match sets. In turn, they have a more frequent opportunity to be selected as parents, and pass on their more general (genomes) to offspring rules. 
* Interpretable:In the interest of data mining and knowledge discovery individual LCS rules are logical, and can be made to be human interpretable IF:THEN statements. Effective strategies have also been introduced to allow for global knowledge discovery identifying significant features, and patterns of association from the rule population as a whole.
* Flexible application
** Single or multi-step problems
** Supervised, Reinforcement or Unsupervised Learning
** Binary Class and Multi-Class Classification
** Regression
** Discrete or continuous features (or some mix of both types)
** Clean or noisy problem domains
** Balanced or imbalanced datasets.
** Accommodates missing data (i.e. missing feature values in training instances)

== Disadvantages ==
* Limited Software Availability: There are a limited number of open source, accessible LCS implementations, and even fewer that are designed to be user friendly or accessible to machine learning practitioners. 
* Interpretation: While LCS algorithms are certainly more interpretable than some advanced machine learners, users must interpret a set of rules (sometimes large sets of rules to comprehend the LCS model.). Methods for rule compaction, and interpretation strategies remains an area of active research.
* Theory/Convergence Proofs: There is a relatively small body of theoretical work behind LCS algorithms. This is likely due to their relative algorithmic complexity (applying a number of interacting components) as well as their stochastic nature. 
* Overfitting: Like any machine learner, LCS can suffer from overfitting despite implicit and explicit generalization pressures.
* Run Parameters: LCSs often have many run parameters to consider/optimize. Typically, most parameters can be left to the community determined defaults with the exception of two critical parameters: Maximum rule population size, and the maximum number of learning iterations. Optimizing these parameters are likely to be very problem dependent. 
* Notoriety: Despite their age, LCS algorithms are still not widely known even in machine learning communities. As a result, LCS algorithms are rarely considered in comparison to other established machine learning approaches. This is likely due to the following factors: (1) LCS is a relatively complicated algorithmic approach, (2) LCS, rule-based modeling is a different paradigm of modeling than almost all other machine learning approaches. (3) LCS software implementations are not as common.
* Computationally Expensive: While certainly more feasible than some exhaustive approaches, LCS algorithms can be computationally expensive. For simple, linear learning problems there is no need to apply an LCS. LCS algorithms are best suited to complex problem spaces, or problem spaces in which little prior knowledge exists.

== Terminology ==
The name, &quot;Learning Classifier System (LCS)&quot;, is a bit misleading since there are many machine learning algorithms that &#x27;learn to classify&#x27; (e.g. decision trees, artificial neural networks), but are not LCSs. The term &#x27;rule-based machine learning (RBML)&#x27; is useful, as it more clearly captures the essential &#x27;rule-based&#x27; component of these systems, but it also generalizes to methods that are not considered to be LCSs (e.g. association rule learning, or artificial immune systems). More general terms such as, &#x27;genetics-based machine learning&#x27;, and even &#x27;genetic algorithm&#x27; have also been applied to refer to what would be more characteristically defined as a learning classifier system. Due to their similarity to genetic algorithms, Pittsburgh-style learning classifier systems are sometimes generically referred to as &#x27;genetic algorithms&#x27;. Beyond this, some LCS algorithms, or closely related methods, have been referred to as &#x27;cognitive systems&#x27;, &#x27;adaptive agents&#x27;, &#x27;production systems&#x27;, or generically as a &#x27;classifier system&#x27;. This variation in terminology contributes to some confusion in the field.

Up until the 2000s nearly all learning classifier system methods were developed with reinforcement learning problems in mind. As a result, the term ‘learning classifier system’ was commonly defined as the combination of ‘trial-and-error’ reinforcement learning with the global search of a genetic algorithm. Interest in supervised learning applications, and even unsupervised learning have since broadened the use and definition of this term.

<text>Suina (also known as Suiformes) is a suborder of omnivorous, non-ruminant artiodactyl mammals that includes the domestic pig and peccaries. A member of this clade is known as a suine. Suina includes the family Suidae, termed suids, known in English as pigs or swine, as well as the family Tayassuidae, termed tayassuids or peccaries. Suines are largely native to Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, with the exception of the wild boar, which is additionally native to Europe and Asia and introduced to North America and Australasia, including widespread use in farming of the domestic pig subspecies. Suines range in size from the 55 cm (22 in) long pygmy hog to the 210 cm (83 in) long giant forest hog, and are primarily found in forest, shrubland, and grassland biomes, though some can be found in deserts, wetlands, or coastal regions. Most species do not have population estimates, though approximately two billion domestic pigs are used in farming, while several species are considered endangered or critically endangered with populations as low as 100. One species, Heude&#x27;s pig, is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to have gone extinct in the 20th century.

==Classification==
Suina&#x27;s placement within Artiodactyla can be represented in the following cladogram:

The suborder Suina consists of 21 extant species in nine genera. These are split between the Suidae family, containing 18 species belonging to 6 genera, and the Tayassuidae family, containing 3 species in 3 genera. This does not include hybrid species such as boar–pig hybrids or extinct prehistoric species. Additionally, one species, Heude&#x27;s pig, went extinct in the 20th century.
* Family Suidae (Pigs)
** Genus &quot;Babyrousa&quot;: four species
** Genus &quot;Hylochoerus&quot;: one species
** Genus &quot;Phacochoerus&quot;: two species
** Genus &quot;Porcula&quot;: one species

<text>Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn (19 November 1812 – 5 May 1881) was a German philologist and folklorist.

Kuhn was born in Königsberg in Brandenburg&#x27;s Neumark region. From 1841, he was connected with the Köllnisches Gymnasium at Berlin, of which he was appointed director in 1870. Kuhn was the founder of a new school of comparative mythology, based upon comparative philology. Inspired by Jakob Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, he first devoted himself to German stories and legends, and published &quot;Märkische Sagen und Märchen&quot; (1842), &quot;Norddeutsche Sagen, Märchen und Gebräuche&quot; (1848), and &quot;Sagen, Gebräuche und Märchen aus Westfalen&quot; (1859).

But it is on Kuhn&#x27;s researches into the language and history of the Indo-Germanic peoples as a whole that his reputation is founded. His chief works in this connection are &quot;Zur ältesten Geschichte der Indogermanischen Völker&quot; (1845), in which he endeavoured to give an account of the earliest civilization of the Indo-Germanic peoples before their separation into different families, by comparing and analysing the original meaning of the words and stems common to the different languages; &quot;Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Göttertranks&quot; (1859; new edition by Ernst Kuhn, under title of &quot;Mythologische Studien&quot;, 1886); and &quot;Über Entwicklungsstufen der Mythenbildung&quot; (1873), in which he maintained that the origin of myths was to be looked for in the domain of language, and that their most essential factors were polysemy and homonymy. Kuhn was also the editor of the &quot;Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete der Indogermanischen Sprachen&quot;, which was at his time the standard periodical on the subject.

Kuhn died in Berlin. See obituary notice by C. F. H. Bruchmann in Bursian&#x27;s &quot;Biographisches Jahrbuch&quot; (1881) and J. Schmidt in the above &quot;Zeitschrift&quot;, xxvi. n.s. 6.

<text>The Simmental or Swiss Fleckvieh is a Swiss breed of dual-purpose cattle. It is named after the Simmental – the valley of the Simme river – in the Bernese Oberland, in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The breed is typically reddish in colour with white markings, and is raised for both milk and meat.

== History ==

=== European origin ===

Among the older and most widely distributed of all breeds of cattle in the world, and recorded since the Middle Ages, the Simmental breed has contributed to the creation of several other famous European breeds, including the Montbéliarde (France), the Pezzata Rossa d&#x27;Oropa (Italy), and the Fleckvieh (Germany and Austria).

=== Africa ===

Namibia (1893) and South Africa (1905) were the first countries outside Europe where the breed was successfully established. Here the breed is known as Simmentaler and is mainly used for beef cattle production under suckler cow systems. The Simmentaler breeders&#x27; society is, as far as registered animals are concerned, by far the largest of the 17 European and British breeds. The main reasons for its popularity are (i) it can be used with great success in crossbreeding for breeding of both cows with much milk and heavy weaners/oxen, (ii) its superb weight growth rate in feedlots - pure or crossed, and (iii) a strict visual inspection is compulsory for registration in the Herdbook.

=== Soviet Union ===

In the former Soviet Union, the Simmental was the most important cattle breed. Russian Simmental (Симментальская корова) accounted for one-quarter of all cattle in the USSR. Through extensive crossbreeding, six strains were developed:&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO/DAD-IS/Russia&quot;&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations / Domestic Animal Diversity Information System: ″Simmentalskaya/Russian Federation.″. Retrieved 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Steppe Simmental (Russian cattle × Simmental bulls)
* Ukrainian Simmental (Grey steppe cattle × Simmental bulls)
* Volga Simmental (Central Russian Kalmyk and Kazakh cattle × Simmental bulls)
* Ural Simmental (Siberian and Kazakh cattle × Simmental)
* Siberian Simmental (Siberian and Buryat cattle × Simmental)
* Far Eastern Simmental (Transbaikal and Yakutian cattle × Simmental)
In 1990, there were 12,849,800 Simmental in the USSR. In 2003, the Simmental count in Russia stood at 2,970,400.

==Characteristics==
===Traditional===
The Simmental has historically been used for dairy and beef, and as draught animals. They are particularly renowned for the rapid growth of their young, if given sufficient feed. Simmentals provide more combined weaning gain (growth) and milk yield than any other breed. They also have lower frequency of dental lesions compared to other breeds.

===Africa===
In contrast to countries which allow black and solid brown coloured Simmental in the herdbook, Namibia and South Africa only register Simmentaler with the typical colour i.e. from dark red or brown to yellow spread over the body in any pattern with at least some white on the forehead and the lower-leg area, solid black or solid red animals are non-existent because they are not registered.

==Types==
No other breed in the world has such a large within-breed-type variation as Simmental-Fleckvieh which is classifiable in the following types: 
* Dairy type like specialised dairy breeds (referring to Swiss Fleckvieh (code SF) with over 55% Red Holstein blood and the French Montebeliard breed);
* Dual purpose but major emphasis on milk;
* Truly dual-purpose (all cows are milked and bulls excel in weight gain);
* Moderate beef type (suckler, extensive ranching with moderate to small frame size);
* Extreme beef type (suckler, comparable to specialised beef breeds like for example Charolais, large frame size).

The traditional colouration of the Simmental has been described variously as &quot;red and white spotted&quot; or &quot;gold and white&quot;, although there is no specific standard colouration, and the dominant shade varies from a pale yellow-gold all the way to very dark red (the latter being particularly popular in the United States). The face is normally white, and this characteristic is usually passed to crossbred calves. The white face is genetically distinct from the white head of the Hereford.

<text>A cyclecar was a type of small, lightweight and inexpensive motorized car manufactured in Europe and the United States between 1910 and the early 1920s. The purpose of cyclecars was to fill a gap in the market between the motorcycle and the car. It could accommodate only two passengers, often sitting in tandem.

The demise of cyclecars was due to larger cars – such as the Citroën Type C, Austin 7 and Morris Cowley – becoming more affordable. Small, inexpensive vehicles reappeared after World War II, and were known as microcars.


== Characteristics ==


Cyclecars were propelled by engines with a single cylinder or V-twin configuration (or occasionally a three or four cylinder engine), which were often air-cooled. Sometimes motorcycle engines were used, in which case the motorcycle gearbox was also used.

All cyclecars were required to have clutches and variable gears. This requirement could be fulfilled by even the simplest devices such as provision for slipping the belt on the pulley to act as a clutch, and varying of the pulley diameter to change the gear ratio. Methods such as belt drive or chain drive were used to transmit power to the drive wheel(s), often to one wheel only, so that no differential was required.

The bodies were lightweight and sometimes offered minimal weather protection or comfort features.

The rise of cyclecars was a direct result of reduced taxation both for registration and annual licences of lightweight small-engined cars. On 14 December 1912, at a meeting of the Federation Internationale des Clubs Moto Cycliste, it was formally decided that there should be an international classification of cyclecars to be accepted by the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, France, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria and Germany. As a result of this meeting, the following classes of cyclecars were defined:
== Origins ==
From 1898 to 1910, automobile production quickly expanded. Light cars of that era were commonly known as voiturettes. The smaller cyclecars appeared around 1910 with a sales boom shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, with Temple Press launching &quot;The Cyclecar&quot; magazine on 27 November 1912 (later renamed &quot;The Light Car and Cyclecar&quot;), and the formation of the Cyclecar Club (which later evolved into British Automobile Racing Club). From 1912, the Motor Cycle show at Olympia became the Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show.

The number of cyclecar manufacturers was less than a dozen in each of the UK and France in 1911, but by 1914, there were over 100 manufacturers in each country, as well as others in Germany, Austria and other European countries. By 1912, the A.C. Sociable was described as &quot;one of the most popular cycle cars on the road, both for pleasure and for business&quot;, though another source states that the &quot;Humberette&quot; was the most popular of cycle cars at that time. Many of the numerous makes were relatively short-lived, but several brands achieved greater longevity, including Bédélia (1910–1925), GN (1910–1923) and Morgan (1910–present).

== Demise ==
By the early 1920s, the days of the cyclecar were numbered. Mass producers, such as Ford, were able to reduce their prices to undercut those of the usually small cyclecar makers. Similar affordable cars were offered in Europe, such as the Citroën 5CV, Austin 7 or Morris Cowley.

The cyclecar boom was over. The majority of cyclecar manufacturers closed down. Some companies such as Chater-Lea survived by returning to the manufacture of motorcycles.

After the Second World War, small, economic cars were again in demand and a new set of manufacturers appeared. The cyclecar name did not reappear however, and the cars were called microcars by enthusiasts and bubble cars by the general population.

== Motor racing ==
Several motor racing events for cyclecars were run between 1913 and 1920. The first race dedicated to cyclecars was organised by the Automobile Club de France in 1913, followed by a Cyclecar GP at Le Mans in 1920. The Auto Cycle Union was to have introduced cycle car racing on the Isle of Man in September 1914, but the race was abandoned due to the onset of the war.

<text>Sophie Lee (born 7 August 1968) is an Australian film, stage and television actress and author.

==Career==
Lee worked as a model early in her career, both in Australia and Japan appearing in print and on TV. Her first feature film was &quot;Raw Silk&quot; in 1988.

She first rose to fame in 1990 for hosting &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; on Australian TV. The Nine Network series, which had previously not been hosted, featured &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; and other Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons, plus occasional other material, such as an interview between Sophie and Kylie Minogue. She was cast by executive producer David Lyle out of 150 candidates. In 1991, Lee started playing the ongoing role of Penny Wellings in the drama series &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;.

That year Lee also formed a pop group, Freaked Out Flower Children, performing on saxophone and vocals. In December that year the group issued their sole album, &quot;Love In&quot;, which Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, found was &quot;full of syncopated beats and breezy melodies wrapped around tunes&quot;. The group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Spill the Wine&quot;, was a cover version of Eric Burdon and War&#x27;s 1970 hit. Freaked Out Flower Children&#x27;s version reached No. 31 on the ARIA Singles Chart but by 1993 the group had disbanded &quot;the concept had run its course ... [as the] retro-cabaret and day-glo focus of the ensemble ... did little to foster a sense of longevity&quot;.

In 1992, she also hosted the TV series &quot;Sex&quot;. Lee built on this in the media, speaking out on feminism, sexism and the need for sex education in the AIDS era.

Lee has acted in a number of iconic films, including the Australian comedies &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, &quot;Bootmen&quot; and &quot;The Castle&quot; as well as cult films such as &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot; and &quot;Titsiana Booberini&quot;. She is a patron of &quot;Big Screen&quot; at the National Film and Sound Archive. For her performance in the 1997 film &quot;The Castle&quot;, Lee was nominated for the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Lee has appeared in a number of stage productions, including &quot;Mr Kolpert&quot; with the Sydney Theatre Company and the title role in &quot;The Virgin Mim&quot;. From 2008, she has hosted &quot;Natgeo Presents with Sophie Lee&quot; on the National Geographic channel. She is also a commentator on the series &quot;20 to 1&quot;.

In 2007, Lee branched into writing, releasing a book in 2007 titled &quot;Alice in La La Land&quot; through Random House publishing. The book is inspired by her time spent in Hollywood. Also in 2007, she became a columnist for &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot;. In 2009 Sophie released her first children&#x27;s novel titled &quot;Edie Amelia and the Monkey Shoe Mystery&quot;, a story for 7+ year-olds, published by Pan Macmillan. The second title in the series is &quot;Edie Amelia and The Runcible River Fever&quot;.

==Personal life==
Born in Newcastle, New South Wales, her family did not have a TV in the house as her father, a philosophy professor at the University of Newcastle, preferred more intellectual pursuits. She attended the local public school in Dudley, Newcastle, and St Mary&#x27;s Convent school. She completed year 12 at St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College, Hamilton, in 1986, achieving academic excellence. She appeared in a school production of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, playing Baron Frankenstein. She moved to Sydney at age 18 for her career. When working at GTV-9 in the early 1990s, she lived in St Kilda, Victoria.

For six years up to early 2000, she was the partner of Melbourne comedian Mick Molloy, regularly appearing on his nationally syndicated radio show.

In 2002 she married Anthony Freedman and stated that she would be converting to Judaism. The couple have a daughter, Edie, and two sons, Tom and Jack.

==In popular culture==
* Australian band TISM&#x27;s 1993 song &quot;Get Thee to a Nunnery&quot; was specifically about Sophie Lee, mentioning her by name.

<text>Swami Prabhavananda (December 26, 1893 – July 4, 1976) was an Indian philosopher, monk of the Ramakrishna Order, and religious teacher. He moved to America in 1923 to take up the role of assistant minister in the San Francisco Vedanta Society. In 1928 he was the minister of a small group in Portland, OR, but in 1930 he founded the Vedanta Society of Southern California. The Swami spent the rest of his life there, writing and collaborating with some of the most distinguished authors and intellectuals of the time, including Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, and Gerald Heard.

==Biography==

Born in India, he joined the Ramakrishna Order after graduating from Calcutta university in 1914. He was initiated by 
Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Sri Ramakrishna, and the first president of the Ramakrishna Order, headquartered in Belur, West Bengal.

In 1923, he was sent to the United States of America. Initially, he worked as an assistant minister of the Vedanta Society of San Francisco. After two years, he established the Vedanta Society of Portland. In December 1929, he moved to Los Angeles, where he founded the Vedanta Society of Southern California in 1930.

Under his administration, the Vedanta Society of Southern California grew over the years to become the largest Vedanta Society in the West, with monasteries in Hollywood and Trabuco Canyon and convents in Hollywood and Santa Barbara.

Prabhavananda was a scholar who wrote a number of books on Vedanta and Indian religious scriptures and commentary. He was assisted on several of the projects by Christopher Isherwood and Frederick Manchester. His comprehensive knowledge of philosophy and religion attracted such disciples as Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard.

Prabhavananda died on the bicentennial of America&#x27;s independence, July 4, 1976, and on the 74th anniversary of the death, or mahasamadhi, of Swami Vivekananda, the founder of the Ramakrishna Order in India and many of the Vedanta centers in America and Europe.

==Influence==

Prabhavananda&#x27;s book &quot;The Spiritual Heritage of India&quot; was reviewed in the academic journal &quot;Philosophy&quot;. The review stated that &quot;Swami Prabhavananda has written a charming and authoritative book on the spiritual heritage of India, by which he means that heritage in consonance with the Vedic tradition and its culmination in Vedanta&quot; (p. 376). The reviewer stated that &quot;throughout the book breathes an air of relaxed simplicity and conviction... I was particularly refreshed by the absence of attacks on science, materialism, naturalism, and other such means to spiritual fulfilment&quot; (pp. 376–377).

Prabhavananda and Isherwood&#x27;s translation of the ’’Bhagavad Gita – The Song of God’’ was reviewed by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in 1945. &quot;Time&quot; described the translation as &quot;a distinguished literary work&quot; that was &quot;simpler and freer than other English translations (three of which have been published in the past year)... It may help U.S. readers to understand not only the &quot;Gita&quot; itself, but also its influence on American letters through one of its greatest U.S. admirers, Ralph Waldo Emerson&quot; (pp. 98, 100).

==MATV==
===MATV Channel 6===

MATV Channel 6 was broadcast in Leicester on UHF Channel 68 (frequency 847.25 MHz - Horizontally polarised) from 27 May 1999 until late 2009. It was also available on Virgin&#x27;s analogue cable network in the Leicester area on channel 46 until 1 February 2010, when the analogue cable service was switched off in the area. The channel was also available on Virgin Media&#x27;s digital cable network on channel 823 in the Leicester area, until March 2010 when the feed was switched to MATV National.

The shows were primarily local based and produced at their Woodboy Street studios in Leicester.

===MATV National===

MATV National broadcasts free-to-air on Sky channel 711. Between March 2010 and 19 May 2011 that channel was also available on Virgin Media channel 823 in Leicester.

The channel was affiliated with SAB TV when it launched on 15 September 2003, however SAB TV was taken over in India, and the UK branch of SAB TV (located in Wembley) became known as MATV National. The channel was also affiliated with India&#x27;s Sanskar TV until June 2010. From March 2010, 30 hours of airtime per month was sold to Gateway TV, a Christian TV channel, broadcasting at 20:00.

==Additional channels==
===Kama Sutra===
During 2006, MATV attempted to launch the UK&#x27;s first Asian adult channel, called Kama Sutra. Although MATV refused to comment on the channel, a broadcasting licence was issued by Ofcom, which was later transferred to MATV Music.

===MATV India===
On 11 March 2010, MATV announced its intention to expanding to Asia with MATV India. MATV India would be carried by cable operators in various parts of Asia, including India, uplinked by Thaicom 5.

In February 2011, MTunes, a Hindi music station was launched instead.

===MATV Music===

On 6 November 2007, announced their intention to launch a 24-hour free-to-air music channel called MATV Music and began testing on Eutelsat&#x27;s 28A satellite at 28.5°E. Later it was revealed that the channel would initially be called Iqra TV, with programming from Indian channel Music India and a launch date scheduled for 19 November 2007.

On 5 December 2007, Music India launched on Sky channel 829, using the bandwidth previously used for the Iqra TV tests and still carrying the Iqra TV label, with MATV providing distribution. On 7 January 2008, the channel was relabelled Music India and was officially launched.

===Sukrit===
On 2 November 2008, Harjap Singh Bhangal confirmed rumours that MATV was in talks to start a 24-hour free-to-air Punjabi religious channel called Sukrit. The new channel was expected to launch in January 2009 subject to EPG space on Sky. Rumours suggested that the broadcaster was in talks with numerous Punjabi channels in India including PTC Punjabi for content sharing. A broadcasting licence was granted by Ofcom under the name MATV(Punjabi). The channel never launched.

<doc id="854478" wikidata="Q1630757" url="?curid=854478" title="Hot Standby Router Protocol">
<text>In computer networking, the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) is a Cisco proprietary redundancy protocol for establishing a fault-tolerant default gateway. Version 1 of the protocol was described in in 1998. Version 2 of the protocol includes improvements and supports IPv6 but there is no corresponding RFC published for this version.

The protocol establishes an association between gateways in order to achieve default gateway failover if the primary gateway becomes inaccessible. HSRP gateways send multicast &quot;hello&quot; messages to other gateways to notify them of their priorities (which gateway is preferred) and current status (&quot;active&quot; or &quot;standby&quot;).

==Operation==
The primary router with the highest configured priority will act as a &quot;virtual&quot; router with a pre-defined gateway IP address and will respond to the ARP or ND request from machines connected to the LAN with a virtual MAC address. If the primary router should fail, the router with the next-highest priority would take over the gateway IP address and answer ARP requests with the same MAC address, thus achieving transparent default gateway failover.

In the virtual MAC address, Xs represent the group ID in hex.

HSRP is not a routing protocol as it does not advertise IP routes or affect the routing table in any way.

HSRP has the ability to trigger a failover if one or more interfaces on the router go down. This can be useful for dual branch routers each with a single link back to the gateway. If the link of the primary router goes down, the backup router will take over the primary functionality and thus retain connectivity to the gateway.

==Version 2==
Version 2 of the protocol introduces stability, scalability and diagnostic improvements. It is not compatible with version 1 HSRP. There is no RFC for version 2 of the protocol.
* Provides IPv6 support
* Increases the number of HSRP groups from 256 to 4096

<doc id="854487" wikidata="Q228717" url="?curid=854487" title="Rose Byrne">
<text>Mary Rose Byrne (born 24 July 1979) is an Australian actress. She made her screen debut in the film &quot;Dallas Doll&quot; (1994), and continued to act in Australian film and television throughout the 1990s. She gained her first leading film role in &quot;The Goddess of 1967&quot; (2000), which earned her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, and made the transition to American cinema with a small role in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), followed by &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), and &quot;Knowing&quot; (2009).

Roles in &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot; (2010), &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (2011), &quot;Neighbors&quot; (2014), &quot;Spy&quot; (2015), and &quot;Instant Family&quot; (2018) established her as a comedic actress. She also starred in the horror film &quot;Insidious&quot; (2010) and its sequels &quot;&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2023); the superhero films &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011) and &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016); and the family films &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; (2018) and its sequel &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot; (2021). For her performance as a troubled mother in &quot;If I Had Legs I&#x27;d Kick You&quot; (2025), she received the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance.

On television, Byrne appeared as Ellen Parsons in the legal thriller series &quot;Damages&quot; (2007–2012), which earned her nominations for two Golden Globe Awards and two Primetime Emmy Awards. She also portrayed Gloria Steinem in the miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; (2020) and led the comedy series &quot;Physical&quot; (2021–2023) and &quot;Platonic&quot; (2023). 

==Early life==
Byrne was born in Balmain, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. She has Irish and Scottish ancestry. Her parents are Jane, a primary school administrator, and Robin Byrne, a semi-retired statistician and market researcher. She is the youngest of their four children; she has an older brother, George, and two older sisters, Alice and Lucy. In a 2009 interview, Byrne said that her mother was an atheist, while both she and her father were agnostic. Her family was described by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as &quot;close-knit&quot;, and frequently kept her grounded as her career took off. &quot;At one point one of my sisters had a word with me saying, &#x27;Watch yourself&#x27;&quot;, she once remarked. &quot;But they were really supportive.&quot;

Byrne attended Balmain Public School,&lt;ref name=&quot;msn/ar-AA132dBm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Theatre for Young People (at age eight, encouraged by one of her sisters), and Hunters Hill High School&lt;ref name=&quot;spectator.com.au/2016/11/byrne-rehearsal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; before attending Bradfield Senior College&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/breath-away&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for years 11 and 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au/20030705-gdvzto&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She later lived in the Sydney suburbs of Newtown and Bondi. Growing up, she experienced &quot;plenty of rejection&quot; from film schools. &quot;I auditioned for a few of the big drama schools—Nepean, WAAPA, NIDA—and didn&#x27;t get in to any of them. I was really disappointed with myself. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if I&#x27;d be legitimate without training for three years in a more traditional sense&quot;. Instead, she studied an arts degree at Sydney University.
&quot;I still have great memories of those days: studying, working, auditioning. Just being a jobbing actor trying to figure out life after high school&quot;. In 1999, she studied acting at the Atlantic Theater Company, which was developed by David Mamet and William H. Macy.

==Career==
===1994–2006: Beginnings===
Byrne obtained her first film role in &quot;Dallas Doll&quot; (1994) when she was 15 years old. Throughout the 1990s, she appeared in several Australian television shows, such as &quot;Wildside&quot; (1997) and &quot;Echo Point&quot; (1995), and starred as the love interest in the film &quot;Two Hands&quot; (1999), opposite fellow up-and-coming actor Heath Ledger. A role in the award-winning film &quot;My Mother Frank&quot; (2000) was followed by her first leading role in Clara Law&#x27;s &quot;The Goddess of 1967&quot; (also 2000), which gained her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 57th Venice International Film Festival. Byrne revealed in a post-award interview that, prior to winning the Venice Film Festival Award, she was surprised by her own performance and found it confronting watching the film because her acting was &quot;too depressing&quot;. Byrne admitted that &quot;watching myself is confronting because I&#x27;m convinced I can&#x27;t act and I want to get out, that&#x27;s how insecure I am.&quot;

On stage, Byrne starred in &quot;La Dispute&quot; and in a production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s classic &quot;Three Sisters&quot; at the Sydney Theatre Company. In 2002, she appeared in a brief appearance as Dormé, the handmaiden to Natalie Portman&#x27;s Senator Padmé Amidala, in George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. She then transitioned to Hollywood as she appeared in the 2002 thriller &quot;City of Ghosts&quot;, with Matt Dillon. Byrne had flown to the UK to shoot &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; (2003), Tim Fywell&#x27;s adaptation of the 1948 novel of the same title by Dodie Smith. In it, she portrayed Rose Mortmain, the elder sister of Romola Garai&#x27;s Cassandra.

In 2003, Byrne starred in three Australian films; &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot;, with Melanie Griffith and Dennis Hopper; &quot;The Rage in Placid Lake&quot;, with Ben Lee; and &quot;Take Away&quot;, alongside Vince Colosimo, Stephen Curry, John Howard and Nathan Phillips. All films were comedies and opened to varying degrees of success at the box office, but &quot;The Rage in Placid Lake&quot; earned Byrne an AACTA Award nomination for Best Actress. In the epic drama &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), she took on the role of Briseis, the captured priestess presented to &quot;amuse&quot; Brad Pitt&#x27;s Achilles. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review of the film stated: &quot;Byrne&#x27;s spoils-of-war chattel plays more as a convenient invention than as a woman who could possibly turn Achilles’ head and heart around&quot;. In her other 2004 film release, the thriller &quot;Wicker Park&quot;, Byrne appeared, opposite Josh Hartnett and Diane Kruger, as the girlfriend of a young advertising executive&#x27;s old friend. &quot;Wicker Park&quot; director Paul McGuigan described her as the best actress he has worked with, and her &quot;Troy&quot; co-star Peter O&#x27;Toole described her as &quot;beautiful, uncomplicated, simple, pure actress and a very nice girl&quot;.

Byrne reunited with Peter O&#x27;Toole, playing a young servant, in the BBC TV drama &quot;Casanova&quot; (2005), a three-&quot;episode&quot; production about 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova. In 2005, she also starred with Snoop Dogg in &quot;The Tenants&quot;, based on Bernard Malamud&#x27;s novel. In 2006, Byrne portrayed Gabrielle de Polastron, duchesse de Polignac, a French aristocrat and friend of Marie Antoinette, in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;, with Kirsten Dunst; and appeared as a medical examiner who thinks the dead woman she is prepping is her missing sister in the critically acclaimed thriller &quot;The Dead Girl&quot;, directed by Karen Moncrieff.

===2007–2012: Breakthrough===
In 2007, Byrne had significant parts in two studio sci-fi thriller films. She played a space vessel&#x27;s pilot in Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine&quot;, alongside Cillian Murphy and Chris Evans, and also an army medical officer in Juan Carlos Fresnadillo&#x27;s &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, the sequel to Boyle&#x27;s &quot;28 Days Later&quot;. While &quot;Sunshine&quot; flopped, &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; was a critical success and grossed over US$64.2 million globally. In 2007, Byrne began playing Ellen Parsons, a bright, young attorney, in the FX legal thriller television series &quot;Damages&quot;, alongside Glenn Close. Her performance was widely praised; she was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2009 and 2010, and for Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2008 and 2010. She appeared in all 59 episodes of the series until its finale in September 2012.

Following starring roles in the 2008 independent films &quot;Just Buried&quot;, directed by Chaz Thorne, and &quot;The Tender Hook&quot;, with Hugo Weaving, Byrne returned to the mainstream with the role of the mother of a teen, alongside Nicolas Cage, in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Knowing&quot; (2009); it made US$186.5 million worldwide and received mixed reviews. Byrne said she had not yet become strategic about her film choices. &quot;You gravitate to where you want to go, but so much is out of your control&quot;, she remarked. After the success of &quot;Damages&quot;, she asked her agents to send her out for comedies. &quot;I was doing all of this really heavy, dramatic stuff, and I just needed a break,” she said. Her request was met when she obtained the role of a scandalous pop star and the on-and-off girlfriend of a free-spirited rock star in the comedy &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot; (2010), also starring Russell Brand and Jonah Hill. Director Nicholas Stoller admitted that, in her audition, he thought: &quot;&#x27;Why is she here?&#x27; Because, you know, very good actress, but very serious&quot;. Nevertheless, he noted that Byrne &quot;just destroyed [...] Like, destroyed in the way that someone from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; would. And that was that&quot;. The film was a commercial success, with a gross of US$60.9 million in North America.

2011 was a turning point in Byrne&#x27;s career, when she appeared in three high-profile theatrical films, leading to a trajectory that included three to four films per year. In her first 2011 release, James Wan&#x27;s horror film &quot;Insidious&quot;, she starred as a mother whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for malevolent spirits in an astral realm. Budgeted at US$1.5 million, it grossed US$97 million and began a franchise. The comedy &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; featured Byrne as the rich, beautiful, elite wife of the groom&#x27;s boss, alongside Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Ellie Kemper, and Wendi McLendon-Covey. It was a critical and commercial success, it grossed US$26 million in its opening weekend and eventually over US$288 million worldwide.

Byrne appeared in &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn, as Moira MacTaggert, a character she described as: &quot;a woman in a man&#x27;s world, she&#x27;s very feisty and ambitious—you know, she&#x27;s got a toughness about her which I liked&quot;. She said she was unfamiliar with both the comics and the film series, except for &quot;what a juggernaut of a film it was&quot;. She was cast late into production, which had already begun. Her third and final 2011 film, &quot;First Class,&quot; was also a box office success, grossing US$353.6 million worldwide.

===2013–present: Continued comedic roles and &quot;Insidious&quot; films===

Byrne had four film releases and one short film in 2013. She obtained the part of the newlywed wife, opposite Rafe Spall, in &quot;I Give It a Year&quot;, a comedy about the trials and tribulations of a couple during their first year of marriage. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found Byrne and Spall to be &quot;mismatched&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; praised their chemistry and noted: &quot;&quot;Year&quot; will do nothing but enhance the reputations of its core actors, especially Byrne, who&#x27;s shaping up into an ace comedienne perfectly suited to screwball&quot;. The film was a commercial success in the UK and Australia, where it was given a wide release in theatres. In &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;, a generational drama directed by Derek Cianfrance, she appeared with Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, as the wife of a police officer who shoots a bank robber and has to deal with the consequences. She played a Google executive in the film &quot;The Internship&quot;, opposite Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, as she was drawn to &quot;the way it addressed the generational gaps and the ever-changing landscape of the technological world&quot;.

Byrne filmed &quot;The Turning&quot;, a short film installment in a Tim Winton omnibus feature, and worked again with fellow Australians Wan and Whannell for the sequel &quot;&quot;, reuniting with Patrick Wilson and Lin Shaye. The film received mixed reviews from critics and became the biggest opening day in North America box office history for the month of September following its release. It eventually made over US$160 million against a budget of US$5 million. 2014 saw Byrne star in the family dramedies &quot;Adult Beginners&quot; and &quot; This Is Where I Leave You&quot; as well as the comedy &quot;Neighbors&quot;, alongside Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, in which she played one half of a couple who come into conflict with a fraternity that has recently moved in next door. Critics highlighted her performance in &quot;Neighbors&quot;, with &quot;The Atlantic&quot; writing: &quot;Byrne walks away with the film by making [her character] a well-rounded, conflicted person, rather than the film&#x27;s fun cop who has to tell everyone the boring truth&quot;. The film was a box office success, taking in US$270.1 million worldwide.

A critically panned but commercially successful remake of the 1982 classic, &quot;Annie&quot;, was released in December 2014 and featured Byrne playing the role of Grace Farrell, the titular character&#x27;s mother figure and Mr. Stacks&#x27; faithful personal assistant. In 2015, Byrne reunited with Melissa McCarthy and starred with Jude Law and Jason Statham in the hit comedic action film &quot;Spy&quot;, playing the daughter of an arms dealer, and also starred with Susan Sarandon in the dramedy &quot;The Meddler&quot; as the daughter of an ageing widow who moves to Los Angeles in hopes of starting a new life after her husband passes away. The film was acclaimed by critics and found an audience in limited release. In 2016, she reprised her roles in &quot;Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising&quot; and &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, and in 2017, she filmed the black comedy &quot;I Love You, Daddy&quot;, directed by and also starring Louis C.K., but it was dropped by its distributor following sexual misconduct accusations made against C.K.

In 2018, Byrne voiced Jemima Puddle-Duck and played a local woman named Bea who spends her time painting pictures of the rabbits in the live-action comedy &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, which made US$351.2 million worldwide. She reprised her role in the 2021 sequel &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot;. In &quot;Juliet, Naked&quot; (also 2018), a romantic comedy adapted from Nick Hornby&#x27;s novel of the same name, she appeared as a woman dating an obscure rock musician (played by Ethan Hawke). The film was an arthouse success, with Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; critical consensus reading: &quot;&quot;Juliet, Naked&quot;&#x27;s somewhat familiar narrative arc is elevated by standout work from a charming cast led by a well-matched Rose Byrne and Ethan Hawke.&quot; &quot;I Am Mother&quot; (2019) is a thriller and sci-fi movie with Clara Rugaard and Oscar winner Hilary Swank. Byrne costarred with Adam Devine, Alexandra Shipp, and Wanda Sykes as a voiced a virtual assistant in the movie &quot;Jexi&quot; (2019).

In 2025, she received the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance at the 75th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance as a troubled mother in &quot;If I Had Legs I&#x27;d Kick You&quot; (2025).

==Public image==
Byrne has been considered one of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women. She ranked 9th and 16th in Australian &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;Sexiest Women in the World&quot;, in 2001 and 2006 respectively. She has been featured several times in &quot;The Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces from Around the World&quot;, ranking 15th (2004), 3rd (2005), 7th (2006), 5th (2007), 8th (2008), 1st (2009), and 15th (2010). She was also featured in the &quot;Most Beautiful People&quot; list of 2007 in &quot;Who Magazine&quot;, and ranked 5th in Hallmark Channel&#x27;s 2008 &quot;TV&#x27;s Sexiest Leading Woman&quot; poll. She was voted 78th on Ask Men&#x27;s Top 99 &#x27;most desirable&#x27; woman of 2012 list, and &quot;People&quot; ranked her 7th in its &quot;Best Dressed Celebrities&quot; list of 2015. Byrne was the face of Max Factor between 2004 and 2009, and in 2014, she became the face of Oroton, the Australian producer of luxury fashion accessories.

Since the beginning of her career, her performances have been acclaimed by critics. In 2018, Byrne was noted for her comedic work. She consciously made the transition to less dramatic material in the late 2000s, finding the idea of being &quot;boxed in&quot; to be &quot;insufferable&quot;. &quot;You have to be aggressive in this business,” she noted. &quot;You have always got to push for what you want. Working with Glenn [Close, on &quot;Damages&quot;], she was the hardest worker ever. She was constantly pushing&quot;. Her turn to comedy led to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling her &quot;the most in-demand supporting actress for comedies&quot;. &quot;Decider&quot; wrote a story titled &quot;How Did Rose Byrne Become One of Our Best Comedic Actresses?&quot;, in which it was remarked: &quot;Byrne&#x27;s emergence as one of the brightest stars in the Apatowverse is all the more remarkable for her lack of a comedy background. [...] Any doubts about Byrne&#x27;s massive comedic talent—and after &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; and &quot;Neighbors&quot;, you&#x27;d have to be pretty stubborn to still have doubts—were put to rest with 2015&#x27;s &quot;Spy&quot;, where she again steals the show as merciless terrorist Rayna. Byrne and McCarthy&#x27;s private-plane banter is the highlight of the film and could have gone on another 30 minutes as far as I&#x27;m concerned&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Byrne lived in New York and said she remained insecure about a stable career: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that insecurity ever leaves you. You&#x27;re a freelancer. There&#x27;s always an element of uncertainty.&quot; Byrne has supported UNICEF Australia as the face of the 2007 Designers United campaign, and was a jury member of Tropfest in 2006 and Tropfest@Tribeca in 2007. She is a graduate and ambassador for NIDA&#x27;s (National Institute of Dramatic Art) Young Actors Studio.

Through her brother George&#x27;s marriage, Byrne is the sister-in-law of New Zealand actress Rose McIver. Byrne was in a relationship with Australian actor Brendan Cowell for over six years. He moved from Sydney to New York City following Byrne&#x27;s success on &quot;Damages&quot;. Their relationship ended in January 2010. Byrne has been in a relationship with American actor Bobby Cannavale since 2012. They have two sons, born in February 2016 and November 2017.

<text>A Mercury crosser or Mercury grazer is an asteroid whose orbit crosses that of Mercury. The Mercury crossers proper have aphelia outside Mercury&#x27;s (0.4667 AU) and perihelia inside Mercury&#x27;s (0.3075 AU), whereas those listed here as outer grazers have perihelia within Mercury&#x27;s aphelion but not within its perihelion. All have semi-major axes larger than Mercury&#x27;s, and hence there are no known inner grazers.

== List ==
Mercury crossers proper have aphelia outside Mercury&#x27;s (0.4667 AU) and perihelia inside Mercury&#x27;s (0.3075 AU). , 362 Mercury crossers were known. (Most values have been rounded to three decimals.)

==Mercury grazers==
All Mercury grazers have semi-major axes larger than Mercury&#x27;s (0.3871 AU), and hence are outer grazers, i.e. have perihelia within Mercury&#x27;s aphelion (0.4667 AU) but not within its perihelion (0.3075 AU). , there are 561 Mercury grazers known. (Values have been rounded to three decimals.)

<doc id="854492" wikidata="Q563177" url="?curid=854492" title="Noah Taylor">
<text>Noah George Taylor (born 4 September 1969) is an Australian actor. The accolades he has received include nominations for three Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Critics&#x27; Choice Award, and four AACTA Awards.

He is best known for his roles as teenage David Helfgott in &quot;Shine&quot;, Locke in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, Darby Sabini in the BBC One series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, Mr. Bucket in &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and Danny in the Australian cult film &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot;. Taylor also starred as Adolf Hitler in both the American television series &quot;Preacher&quot; and the 2002 film &quot;Max&quot;. In 2023 he starred as Dr. Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Pfeffer in &quot;A Small Light&quot;.

==Early life==
Taylor, elder of two sons, was born in London to Australian parents, Maggie (née Miller), a journalist and book editor, and Paul Taylor, a copywriter and journalist. His parents returned to Australia when he was five, and he grew up in Clifton Hill and St Kilda, suburbs of Melbourne.

After performing in plays at St Martins Youth Arts Centre in South Yarra for a year, he gained the attention of director John Duigan, who cast him in the 1987 film &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot;, the first part of a planned trilogy. Taylor also appeared in its sequel, &quot;Flirting&quot; (1991), alongside Thandiwe Newton with Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts in supporting roles.

==Career==
===Film===
Taylor&#x27;s early screen roles included playing the lead in the critically acclaimed &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot; and &quot;Flirting&quot; and he gained significant international attention playing the tormented young pianist David Helfgott in the 1996 film &quot;Shine&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s résumé includes action movies (&quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;), comedies (&quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;), psychological thrillers (&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; and &quot;Predestination&quot;) and historical dramas (&quot;Max&quot;, in which he played the young Adolf Hitler). He also played the role of Adolf Hitler in AMC&#x27;s series &quot;Preacher&quot;.

Taylor once commented in an interview that he was sick of acting out the nostalgic reminiscences of other people. He has done this in a number of films including &quot;The Nostradamus Kid&quot;, which was based on the early life of the Australian author Bob Ellis, a young David Helfgott in &quot;Shine&quot;, the protagonist in John Birmingham&#x27;s memoir &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot;, and &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, based on the memories of the film&#x27;s writer and director, Cameron Crowe.

In 2010, Taylor starred in Simon Rumley&#x27;s mystery thriller &quot;Red White &amp; Blue&quot;, which had its world premiere as part of the SXSW Film Festival in March 2010.

===Television===
In 2013, Taylor appeared in both the third and fourth seasons of HBO&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, based on the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; book series by George R. R. Martin. In the adaptation, Taylor plays the character of Locke, an original character of the television series, who serves as a condensed version of several characters of the books, most notably the ruthless and sadistic mercenary leader Vargo Hoat.

===Music video appearances===
Taylor has appeared in a small number of music videos. One of his earliest screen performances was in the video for Beargarden&#x27;s song &quot;The Finer Things&quot;. This video was directed by Richard Lowenstein, who then cast Taylor in a supporting role in the film &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;. Much later, he appeared in the video of &quot;Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow&quot;, a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, along with the video for &quot;M.O.R.&quot; by British alternative rock group Blur. He also played a young Romeo in the video &quot;Romeos&quot; from Alphaville.

===Music===
He has also performed and recorded as a musician. In 2001 he released an album &quot;Popular Music for All Peoples&quot; under the name &#x27;C.B.M.&#x27; (Cardboard Box Man) and in 2011, an EP &quot;Live Free or Die!!!&quot; as Noah Taylor &amp; the Sloppy Boys on Z-Man Records.

==Personal life==
When not acting, Taylor draws and paints, and is also an accomplished musician, playing viola and French horn as a young teenager, and guitar from the age of 16. He plays the piano by ear. He has sung and played guitar in several of his own bands, including Honky Tonk Angels, Cardboard Box Man, Flipper &amp; Humphrey, Access Axis, and The Thirteens, a country-western rock band described by Taylor as, &quot;three manic depressives playing sad angst and western music for sad people&quot;. He names Johnny Cash and Lou Reed as two of the artists he admires.

On 14 November 2012, he married Dionne Harris, an Australian fashion designer. Taylor lives in Brighton, East Sussex.

<text>Alex Dimitriades (; born 28 December 1973) is an Australian television, film and stage actor of Greek descent. He is perhaps best known for his roles as Nick Polides in the 1993 romantic comedy film &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; and as Nick Poulos in the 1994 television teen drama spin-off &quot;Heartbreak High&quot;. He won critical acclaim for his role as Ari, a troubled second generation Greek Australian in &quot;Head On&quot; (1998). He won the Film Critics Circle of Australia award for Best Actor for the role and was nominated nominated for the AFI Award for Best Actor. In 2012, he won the AACTA Award for Best Lead Actor for his role in &quot;The Slap&quot;.

==Early life==
Dimitriades was born in Sydney, as Alexandros Dimitriades. He is the son of first generation Greek immigrants and the youngest of three siblings. He has a brother, George, and a sister, Melinda. He grew up in Earlwood, Sydney. His parents divorced when he was 12. His mother worked as a legal secretary, and she raised the children as a single mother.

==Career==
===Film===

Dimitriades first attracted national attention for his co-starring role as Nick Polides in the 1993 Australian romantic comedy film &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, for which he received positive reviews and acclaim.

In 1998, he played the protagonist Ari in the Ana Kokkinos film &quot;Head On&quot;, based on the book &quot;Loaded&quot; by Christos Tsiolkas. Dimitriades&#x27; performance in the role was critically acclaimed and earned him an AFI Award nomination. The film was controversial for its graphic violence, sex scenes and LGBT subject matter, but it earned mostly positive reviews. It screened at dozens of festivals around the world, including the Director&#x27;s Fortnight at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

His other film roles include the Australian comedies &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Skase&quot; (2001) and &quot;La Spagnola&quot; (2001), the Greek film &quot;To Gamilio Party&quot; (English title &quot;Bang Bang Wedding&quot;, 2008), &quot;Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos&quot; (2010), and &quot;Summer Coda&quot; starring with Rachael Taylor. He had roles in the Hollywood films &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (2002) and &quot;Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo&quot; (2005).

In 2015, he co-starred in &quot;Ruben Guthrie&quot; with Patrick Brammall.

===Television===
After making his acting debut in the film &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, he starred in a television spin-off &quot;Heartbreak High&quot;, in which he played Nick Poulos. He went on to play underworld figure, Warren Lanfranchi, in the 1995 drama television series &quot;Blue Murder&quot;. The following year, Dimitriades played estate agent Steve George in the television soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. In 1997, he took a role in the police drama &quot;Wildside&quot;.

In 2002, he appeared in &quot;Young Lions&quot;. In years to follow, he had a small guest role in the Australian science fiction series &quot;Farscape&quot;. In 2008, Dimitriades starred in the drama series &quot;Underbelly&quot;.

In 2011, he featured in &quot;The Slap&quot;, the TV adaptation of the novel of the same name by Christos Tsiolkas. He was awarded the AACTA Award for Best Lead Actor in a Television Drama for his role as the protagonist, Harry. In 2015, he starred in &quot;The Principal&quot;, a SBS four-part crime drama screened over two weeks in October, for which he won a Logie Award. The series received positive reviews and various accolades, including several nominations from the Australian Film Institute in 2016. He appeared in the shows &quot;Secret City&quot; and &quot;Seven Types of Ambiguity&quot;.

In late 2018, Dimitriades had a recurring role in the BBC One drama &quot;The Cry&quot; as Detective Peter Alexiades and in the Netflix series &quot;Tidelands&quot;, again playing a police officer.

In 2021, Dimitriades appeared in the second season of ABC drama &quot;Total Control (TV series)&quot; in the role of Nice Pearce. Dimitriades also appeared in Channel 9 drama &quot;Amazing Grace (Australian TV series)&quot; as Kirk.

In 2022, Dimitriades played the Greek gangster, Kosta, in the TV series &quot;The Tourist&quot; with Jamie Dornan and Danielle Macdonald.
===Theatre===
In 1996 and 1997, Dimitriades, along with Nick Giannopoulos and Vince Colosimo, toured as part of the &quot;Wogboys&quot; comedy stage shows.

Dimitriades has appeared in many theatre productions, including two plays by Louis Nowra for Griffin Theatre Company, &quot;The Woman with Dog&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Emperor of Sydney&quot; (2006); &quot;The Nightwatchman&quot; (2007) and &quot;Rain Man&quot; in 2010; and the Melbourne Theatre Company’s production of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; in 2014.

===DJ===
Dimitriades, an avid collector of vinyl records, has stated that his love of music started in childhood. He has a passion for both hip hop and dance music and has stated he is inspired by Kings Go Forth because of their &quot;’70s sound.&quot; He works as a DJ professionally across Australia, often referred to as DJ Boogie Monster. Dimitriades has headlined and performed at numerous events, including Derby Day, and as the headline act for the relaunch of the popular South Melbourne nightclub Motel.

Although Dimitriades is primarily known as an actor, his DJ work predates his acting work: It&#x27;s partly my fault, I was a DJ before I was an actor, but I wasn&#x27;t known and haven&#x27;t been known as one. It&#x27;s two sides of me that will never go away.”

==Filmography==

===Television===
==Theatre==

==Personal life==
Dimitriades had an 8-year relationship with Terry Biviano in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

In 2005, he was the subject of a portrait that was a finalist in the Archibald Prize, by fine artist Michael Zavros.

In 2008, Dimitriades was arrested driving under the influence. It was reported that he had a blood alcohol reading of .11, more than twice the legal limit in Australia. The charge resulted in the suspension of his driver&#x27;s licence.

In September 2009, his mother died after a long-time illness.

<text>The Candar dynasty (), also known as the Isfendiyar dynasty (), was an Oghuz Turkic princely Anatolian dynasty that reigned in the territories corresponding to the provinces of Eflani, Kastamonu, Sinop, Zonguldak, Bartın, Karabük, Samsun, Bolu, Ankara and Çankırı in present-day Turkey from the year 1291 to 1461. The region was known in Western literature as Paphlagonia, a name applied to the same geographical area during the Roman period.

The dynasty and principality, founded by Şemseddin Yaman Candar Bey, were incorporated into the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Mehmed II in 1461.

==History==
Descended from the Kayı branch of Oghuz Turks, the dynasty began when sultan Mesud II awarded the province of Eflani to Şemseddin Yaman Candar, a senior commander in the imperial armed forces, in gratitude for rescuing him from Mongol captivity. The province had previously been under the rule of the &quot;Çobanoğulları&quot;. 

Following the death of Şemseddin Yaman Candar, his son Süleyman I conquered the neighboring province of Kastamonu and annexed Safranbolu and Sinop, formerly ruled by the descendants of Mu‘in al-Din Suleyman. Süleyman subsequently appointed his son Ibrahim I as Governor of Sinop, while his second son Ali was appointed Governor of Safranbolu. Süleyman reigned under the authority of the Ilkhanate, the Mongols of Persia, until the death of their ruler Abu Sa&#x27;id.

Following the death of Süleyman I, his sons Ibrahim I and Ali were involved in a dynastic struggle for the throne. In 1339, Ibrahim was victorious and thus took over the rule of Kastamonu, the seat of the principality, as &quot;bey&quot;. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his cousin Adil (1346–1361), who in turn was succeeded by his own son, Kötürüm Bayezid. Kötürüm Bayezid Bey fought twice with Kadi Burhan al-Din, ruler of the Sivas region, and in 1383, lost Kastamonu to one of his own sons, Süleyman, who had received military support from the Ottoman sultan Murad I. Following this defeat, Kötürüm Bayezid Bey retreated to Sinop, which led to the division of the Beylik of Candar.

On Kötürüm Bayezid&#x27;s death in 1385, his son Süleyman succeeded him as Süleyman II, and reunited the recently divided principality back into one realm. With Kastamonu Castle as his seat, Süleyman II remained faithful to Murad I, his supporter in his revolt against his father and predecessor, and, from 1386 to 1389, participated in various Ottoman campaigns in Europe. 

In 1391, Murad&#x27;s successor to the Ottoman throne, Bayezid I, launched an assault on Kastamonu in an attempt to gain control of the Anatolian beyliks, which saw the death of Süleyman II and with it an end to the Candar dynasty&#x27;s long reign in Kastamonu.

Succeeding Süleyman II as &quot;bey&quot; was his son and heir İsfendiyar Bey, who in a bid to avoid conflict with the neighboring Ottomans, recognized the suzerainty of Bayezid I and became an Ottoman vassal, which Bayezid reciprocated by granting İsfendiyar autonomy in his dominion. However, after Bayezid was defeated at the hands of the Timurids in 1402, İsfendiyar recognized the authority of their Khan, Timur, who confirmed İsfendiyar&#x27;s rule in the traditional Candar realm of Kastamonu, Kalecik, Tosya, and Çankırı. 

Following the departure of Timur from Anatolia during the Ottoman Interregnum, İsfendiyar Bey stood close to all the four sons of Bayezid I. When one of his sons, Kasım claimed control over Çankırı and Tosya and declared the incorporation of these provinces to the Ottoman Empire, the Candar dominion was divided once more. İsfendiyar revolted against the new sultan Murad II, only to be defeated, and retreated to Sinop in 1423. İsfendiyar Bey died in 1439 and was succeeded by his son Ibrahim II, who upon his own death was succeeded by Ismail in 1443.

Following his conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II turned to Anatolia to unite the beyliks under his rule. In 1461, joining forces with Ismail&#x27;s brother Kızıl Ahmed Bey, he captured Sinop and officially ended the reign of the Candar dynasty, although he did at first appoint Ahmed Bey as the governor of Kastamonu and Sinop, only for the appointment to be revoked in 1464.

=== Dynasty ===
After the incorporation of the Beylik of Candar into the Ottoman Empire, the ruling dynasty was offered various important functions within the administration of the Ottoman state, which they maintained until its dissolution in 1922. Descendants of the Candar dynasty live today as citizens of the Republic of Turkey mostly in Istanbul and in Europe, using various family names. Ayşe Sultan, who was the last identified descendant, died in Ankara in 1981, having benefited from the unique status afforded to the dynasty within the Ottoman Empire.
=== Arms ===
Due to their similarities, the arms of Candar may be confused with what is now referred to as the Star of David. However, in medieval times, this particular symbol was not solely associated with Judaism, but also with Islam where it was known as the Seal of Solomon, borne by the prophet Sulaiman, son of David. The symbol gained popularity amongst the beyliks of Anatolia, with the Beylik of Karaman another state known to have adopted a variation of the seal on its flag.

<text>Alkborough is a parish of 471 people in 192 households (2021 census) in North Lincolnshire, England, located near the northern end of The Cliff range of hills overlooking Trent Falls, the confluence of the River Trent and the River Ouse.

Alkborough, with the hamlet of Walcot about south, forms a civil parish which covers about . The village was once thought to be the location that the Romans called &quot;Aquis&quot;, but that name is now usually associated with the town of Buxton in Derbyshire (&quot;Aquis Arnemetiae&quot;).

==Toponymy==
The place-name Alkborough seems to contain an Old English personal name, &quot;Aluca&quot; or &quot;Alca&quot;, + &quot;berg &quot; (Old English), a hill, a mound; an artificial hill; a tumulus, so &#x27;Alca&#x27;s hill&#x27;. Cameron derived the place-name Walcot from &quot;the cottage, hut or shelter of the Welshman&quot; and suggested that the name might represent an isolated group of Welshmen, identifiable as such in Anglo-Saxon England.

Alkborough appears in the Domesday survey of 1086 as &quot;Alchebarge&quot;.

==History==

===Neolithic===
The earliest evidence of settlement in the area has been found near Kell Well (a spring on the ridge to the south of Alkborough and the west of Walcot) in the form of a stone axe head, flint arrowheads and other finds thought to date from the Neolithic period (4000 BC–2351 BC).

===Bronze Age===
Artifacts including a beaker, dating from the early Bronze Age (2350 BC–1501 BC), were unearthed in 1920, in the grounds of Walcot Hall.

===Iron Age===
During the late Iron Age, Alkborough lay within the territory of the Corieltauvi tribe.

===Roman===
Following Roman invasion of the area, some time after AD43, the local Corieltauvi tribe became a Roman &quot;civitas&quot;. Pottery sherds dating from the 1st to the 4th century AD have been found in the fields south of Countess Close. These finds, along with a pot containing a small hoard of Roman coins, which was unearthed in the grounds of Walcot Hall, indicate the possibility of a Romano-British Settlement here. A geophysical survey taken in 2003 showed clear evidence of a Romano-British ladder settlement.

===Medieval===
The village is the site of the former Alkborough Benedictine Priory Cell. It was founded before 1052, when it is recorded as being given by its founder, Thorold, High Sheriff of Lincolnshire, to Spalding Priory. It was a small priory, being a cell of only three monks, a secular chaplain, and a prior. The cell was dependent on Spalding Priory from 1052 to 1074, then its staffing levels were reduced, until 1220, when it ceased to exist as a monastic house and was abandoned.

It was located at , which is in the south of the village in the grounds of College Farm. A Field Investigator&#x27;s comment from 17 February 1964 states that there is no material evidence of antiquity.

Alkborough Priory Cell is included in the English Heritage Archive (Number: SE 82 SE 7, Monument Number: 61223).

===Wartime===
====Bombing range====
Alkborough Flats was home to a bombing range during the Second World War. The following is a summary of an oral history provided by an Alkborough resident who was school age during Second World War:
The bombing range itself took the form of a chalk marker on Alkborough Flats, and two observation posts positioned on the ridge overlooking the target. An RAF detachment from RAF Elsham Wolds, including two sergeants, were billeted in the southern of the two observation posts. Bombers would take off from Elsham, and drop smoke bombs on the target. Following a bombing run, a bearing on the bomb&#x27;s landing site was taken from each observation post, and the position of the site calculated using triangulation. During one bombing run, a horse was killed, and another bomb narrowly missed a group of children sledging. After the war, agricultural workers ploughing on the Flats regularly reported releasing smoke. During the establishment of the Alkborough Flats Tidal Defence Scheme in 2005/2006, a large quantity of World War II ordnance was removed from the site under supervision of bomb disposal officers. Currently, very little remains of the southern observation post, though an entire wall of the northern observation post is still standing (including the observation windows).

The southern observation post was located at
, and the northern at
. They are both accessible to the public via a public footpath. The location of the chalk target marker is not known exactly, but was somewhere to the west of the new bird hide, which is located at

====Defensive structures====
A number of Second World War defensive structures were also in the Alkborough area, including:
*Three searchlight batteries. One of these (Site 3) was located just west of Whitton Road, at . It was staffed by 1 Troop of 323 Searchlight Battery from October 1941. It was established as part of a special deployment of searchlights to defend the Humber Estuary, complementing existing local searchlight batteries). A typical installation of this type comprised a small ring ditch (providing operators with some shelter during an air raid, a predictor emplacement (for calculating the height/range of aircraft), a light anti-aircraft machine gun pit, a generator and hutted accommodation for the crew. This site is included in the English Heritage Archive (Number: SE 82 SE 62, Monument Number: 1500984).
*A heavy anti-aircraft battery. It was located just south of West Halton Lane (near Southdale Farm), at , and was listed as &#x27;unarmed&#x27; in 1942. This site is included in the English Heritage Archive (Number: SE 82 SE 60, Monument Number: 1473341).

==Governance==
Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lincolnshire for centuries, from a very early time, Alkborough formed part of the Manley Wapentake in the North division of Lindsey. Care for the poor of the parish extends back prior to 1765, though after the Poor Law reforms of 1834, Alkborough became part of the Glanford Brigg Poor Law Union. From 1894 until 1974, Alkborough lay within Glanford Brigg Rural District.

===Population history (1801–2001)===
The population history of the area is reported as the following, transcribed from North Lincolnshire Council website.


===Conservation Area===
The older part of Alkborough, including Julian&#x27;s Bower, Countess Close, and Walcot, lies within a Conservation Area.

==Geography==

Alkborough is situated on an escarpment formed of Triassic Mudstone, known as The Cliff, which runs roughly north–south. The steep mudstone escarpment is to the west, with a shallow slope to the east formed from shale of the Lower Lias in the Jurassic system.

===Alkborough Flats===
Alkborough Flats is an area of low-lying arable farmland of nearly situated at the &quot;Confluence of the Rivers&quot; (Trent Falls) where the Rivers Trent and Ouse join to form the Humber Estuary. The alluvial plain is now jointly owned by the UK&#x27;s Environment Agency and English Nature. Flood defences, which were built in the 1950s to protect the area, have been breached to allow water to reclaim the land at high tide and in times of flooding. The project created of new intertidal habitat in the inner part of the Humber Estuary. The new grassland will be managed to encourage biodiversity, with reedbeds, lagoons and grazing areas.

Alkborough Flats is the first coastal realignment site to be developed as part of the Humber Shoreline Management Plan. This &quot;managed retreat&quot; strategy should lessen the risks of flooding in low-lying towns along the Ouse and Trent by realigning existing flood defences to create compensatory intertidal habitat around the estuary. The relatively new island of Whitton Island in the Humber Estuary falls partly within the parish.

===Walcot===
Walcot is an outlying hamlet situated to the south of Alkborough, and within the same parish.

===Julian&#x27;s Bower===

Close to the Cliff edge is Julian&#x27;s Bower, a unicursal turf maze, 43 feet (13 m) across, of indeterminate age. Although referred to as a maze, being unicursal (having only one way in and one path through) it is more accurately a labyrinth.

According to Arthur Mee&#x27;s book &quot;Lincolnshire&quot; the maze was cut by monks in the 12th century, but White&#x27;s &quot;Lincolnshire Directory&quot; of 1872 maintains that it was constructed in Roman times as part of a game. Others think that while the feature is of Roman origin, it was later used by the Medieval Church for some sort of penitential purpose and only reverted to its former use as an amusement or diversion, after the Reformation.

Firm documentary evidence of its existence only seems to date from 1697 however, when it was noticed, on his travels, by the Yorkshire antiquary Abraham de la Pryme.

In case the maze becomes overgrown or otherwise indistinct, its pattern is recorded, in a 19th-century stained glass church window, on the floor of the church porch and also on the gravestone of James Goulton Constable, which is in Alkborough cemetery.

Julian&#x27;s Bower is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

===Countess Close===

Countess Close (National Monument No. 32622; North Lincolnshire Sites and Monuments Record (NLSMR) No. 44) is a rectangular earthwork lying a few yards to the south of Julian&#x27;s Bower. It measures approx. 80 m × 90 m internally.

It was recorded by the 18th century antiquary, William Stukeley on a visit to the area whilst researching his book &quot;Itinerarium Curiosum&quot; (or &quot;Observations From A Journey&quot;). He thought Countess Close to be a Roman Fort, as did the earlier Abraham de la Pryme. However, a 2003 archaeological project carried out by Humber Field Archaeology concluded that, despite evidence of a Romano-British ladder settlement running south along the ridge from Countess Close, it is probable that the earthwork is the remains of a medieval fortified manor house.

It is thought that Countess Close is named for a Saxon heiress called Countess Lucy of Leicester, Lincoln and Chester. She inherited the land from her husband Ivo Taillebois (who in the time of William the Conqueror was Lord of Holland), who was given the land by Peterborough Abbey. Following Lucy&#x27;s death, Countess Close passed to her son, who then gave the land to Spalding Priory in 1147.

Countess Close is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

===St John the Baptist Church===

Earliest records show a church here in 1052, and the tower is of typical Saxon design. The architecture of the church shows there have been many changes to the building throughout its long history.

The font, although set on a modern base, dates back to Norman times.

The oak reredos behind the altar was made by the famous Robert (Mouseman) Thompson (also known as Mousey Thompson) of Kilburn. His signature mouse can be seen on the right hand upright. The reredos was placed in the church as a memorial in the early 1920s.

Under a capping stone set in the floor near the tower entrance, lies what is believed to be a stone of Romano-British origin.

For some years the church housed a pair of Grotrian-Steinweg grand pianos belonging to the Goldstone and Clemmow piano duo, and was used for many of their recordings.

====Possible Thomas Becket connection====
In 1697, Abraham de la Pryme reported the existence of a stone in the ruined chancel of the church, bearing the inscribed names of &quot;Richardus Bruto Necnon Menonius Hugo, Willelmus Trajo templum hoc lapidus altum, Condebant patria gloria dignia Deo&quot;. The inscription is translated as &quot;Richard Brito as well as Hugh Morville and William Tracy, built with stones this lofty temple, a worthy glory to God&quot;, suggesting that three of the four knights who murdered Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170, (namely Sir Hugh de Morville, Lord of Westmorland, Sir William de Tracy and Sir Richard le Breton), took refuge in Alkborough and helped with restoration of the church. If any such stone ever existed, it cannot now be found.

===Alkborough tower mill===

The tower mill at Alkborough was built circa 1860 of red brick and tar, originally for the milling of cereals. It replaced a post mill which was recorded as still standing in 1853. It remained in wind operation until 1916 (but continued with engine operation for a short while thereafter), and from 2009 became part of a private dwelling. The mill retains two millstones in situ on the first floor. The floors contain re-used timber from the post mill, and two posts are made from a common sail whip.

The tower mill is included in the English Heritage Archive (Number: SE 883,215, Monument Number: 497747). It is located just off West Halton Lane at .

===Walcot Hall===

Walcot Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian country house which stands in 22 acres of parkland in the hamlet of Walcot some 1 mile (2 km) south of the village of Alkborough.

It was built in the mid to late 18th century for Thomas Goulton, modified in the early 1800s and partly demolished in 1964.

Several families have occupied the building, including the Marriotts, Stricklands, Constables and Legards. It was bought by the current owners in 2004.

It is currently used to cater for weddings and corporate events. It is located at .

===Kell Well===

Kell Well is a spring that discharges from a point just below the top of The Cliff escarpment, west of Walcot. However, due to Danish influence the name is not uncommon for springs in eastern England, &quot;keld&quot; being a Danish word for &quot;spring pool&quot;.
The waters of the spring were once believed to have had petrifying properties, but if this were ever the case those properties are now lost. However, the spring is chalybeate. Kell Well was first recorded by Abraham de la Pryme following his visit in 1697. He wrote &quot;a great many pretty stones, being a kind of astroites or starr stones... The country people call them kestles and postles.&quot;
The stones to which De la Pryme referred were the remnants of fossil crinoids. These were once common at Kell Well, though there have been no recorded finds for many years.

Kell Well is accessible to the public via a spur path from the nearby bridleway. It is located at .

===Low Wells===

Low Wells is a spring that discharges from a point just the south side of Prospect Lane, north of (and several yards below) St John the Baptist Church. There is no evidence suggesting how the spring became known as &quot;Low Wells&quot;, though its position below the level of the main part of the village would seem to suggest an obvious answer. The well takes the form of three low brick arches behind a long rectangular trough, into which the water flows. This well-structure is thought to have been constructed . As this arrangement was probably to facilitate the watering of livestock, a pump was installed nearby to tap the springs first and provide clean drinking water for villagers, though this has now gone. The structure was restored in 1986.

Low Wells is accessible to the public from Prospect Lane, and is located at coordinates .

===Apex Light===
By a quirk of the Alkborough &amp; Walcot parish boundary, the Trent Falls light known as Apex Light lies within the parish. This is despite its being &#x27;attached&#x27; to the opposite bank of the River Trent, and inaccessible from Alkborough.
It is located at

<text>The FIA Karting World Championship, officially known as the Mondokart.com FIA Karting World Championship for sponsorship reasons, is a kart racing competition organised by the CIK-FIA. Hosted annually since 1964, it is widely regarded as the most prestigious karting competition in the world.

Several past champions have progressed to win the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship, including Alain Prost and Max Verstappen. Alongside the Karting European Championship, it is one of two major karting competitions sanctioned by the FIA. The championship is notable for being the only FIA World Championship with a female champion: Italian driver Susanna Raganelli in 1966.

As of 2024, the World Championship is held across three direct-drive and three gearbox classes. The primary direct-drive class is OK, and the primary gearbox class is KZ. Secondary classes at the World Championship have traditionally been hosted as the Karting World Cup.

== History ==

The first two World Championships in 1964 and 1965 were held over one final round, there after the world&#x27;s best kart drivers competed for the title over an extended weekend, from Thursday to Saturday, including free and qualifying practice sessions, qualification heats, a pre-final and a final were common. The championship is notable for having the only female FIA World Champion with Susanna Raganelli winning the 1966 World Championship.

From 2011 the championship has been disputed over five rounds, each of them in a different country. From 2014 the world championships returned to a single event with one venue each year organizing the CIK-FIA OK and OK Junior World Championships in one weekend and another venue in a different weekend holding the CIK-FIA KZ World Championships together with the CIK-FIA KZ2 Super Cup and the third and final round of the CIK-FIA Karting Academy Trophy. There is a separate CIK-FIA Endurance Championship, normally held each year at Le Mans, France, and there are separate Continental Championships like the CIK-FIA European Championships (OK, OK junior, KZ, KZ2 and Superkart) and the CIK-FIA Asia Pacific Championships. In 1968 CIK-FIA launched the first World Cup for Juniors.

From 1981 to 1987 the World Championship was raced only with 135 cc Formula K Engines. Before and after the short inaugural return to 100 cc( 1988 and 1989 with Formula SuperCent (FS100) a category that anticipated the so-called Formula Super A) the 100 cc direct-drive karts was the prevailing standard. In 2007, a change in regulations introduced the KF1 category carts, 125 cc karts equipped with electric starters, clutch and rpm limiters set at  rpm, to replace the Formula A karts. The 2010 edition was raced with KF2 karts where the engine rpm is limited at  rpm.

The FIA Karting categories at the world championships are now divided into three main families: direct-drive karts, gearbox karts and Superkarts. All these karts have the technology in common of the 2-stroke engine. Since 2016 the new generation of Original Karts (OK) machines have taken over from the old KF engines. The top category OK at the World Championships is available for drivers from 14 years old in the year they participate. The OK Junior category is aimed at drivers aged between 12 and 14 years old. The gearbox categories KZ and KZ2 share the same specification except for chassis and brakes which are open in the KZ World Championship. The Superkart category is the most unusual discipline of Karting because it can only express itself fully on long racing tracks. With its complete bodywork and twin-cylinder 250 cc engines, developing nearly , these Superkarts are capable of extraordinary performances.

== Karting promotion ==

In 2013 for the first time in its history CIK-FIA called a promoter, WSK Promotion, to perfect the organisation of the major international karting competitions.
The Swiss RGMMC Group is now the Official Promoter of the FIA Karting European and World Championships for the period of 2018-2020 (with the exception of Superkart and Endurance). They try increasing the audience for Karting Competitions worldwide, attracting new partners and working closely with ASNs (National Federations), these are the priorities of RGMMC Group. They also develop the communication and media coverage of the events by providing live video viewing during the events and by partnering with Motorsport.tv for broadcast around the world.

From 2022 all the events of the FIA Karting World Championship were sponsored by the website Mondokart.com and the official name of the competition become MONDOKART.COM FIA KARTING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

<text>Aeshna, or the mosaic darners, is a genus of dragonflies from the family Aeshnidae. Species within this genus are generally known as &quot;hawkers&quot; (Old World) or &quot;darners&quot; (New World).

== Description ==

These are relatively large dragonflies. Their thoraces and abdomens are brown in color, with blue or yellow stripes or spots on the thorax, and yellow, blue or green spots on the abdomen.

Natalia von Ellenrieder&#x27;s 2003 paper demonstrated that the Holarctic and Neotropical species placed in this genus did not share a common ancestor, and proposed the latter be placed in the genus &quot;Rhionaeschna&quot;.

The name &quot;Aeshna&quot; was coined by the Danish entomologist Fabricius in the 18th century. The name may have resulted from a printer&#x27;s error in spelling the Greek &quot;Aechma&quot;, &quot;a spear&quot;. The spelling &quot;Aeschna&quot; has been intermittently used over a period of time, but is now abandoned for the original name &quot;Aeshna&quot;. However, derived genus names (such as &quot;Rhionaeschna&quot;) retain the &#x27;sch&#x27; spelling, as this is how they were first cited.

== Species ==
Many species formerly included in &quot;Aeshna&quot; have been split into other genera, including &quot;Afroaeschna&quot;, &quot;Andaeschna&quot;, &quot;Pinheyschna&quot;, &quot;Rhionaeschna&quot;, and &quot;Zosteraeschna&quot;.

The genus &quot;Aeshna&quot; includes these species:
*&quot;Aeshna affinis&quot; – southern migrant hawker, blue-eyed hawker
*†&quot;Aeshna andancensis&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna athalia&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna caerulea&quot; – azure hawker
*&quot;Aeshna canadensis&quot; – Canada darner
*&quot;Aeshna clepsydra&quot; – mottled darner
*&quot;Aeshna constricta&quot; – lance-tipped darner
*&quot;Aeshna crenata&quot; – Siberian hawker
*&quot;Aeshna cyanea&quot; – blue hawker, southern hawker
*&quot;Aeshna eremita&quot; – lake darner
*&quot;Aeshna frontalis&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna grandis&quot; – brown hawker
*&quot;Aeshna interrupta&quot; – variable darner
*&quot;Aeshna isoceles&quot; – Norfolk Hawker
*&quot;Aeshna juncea&quot; – common hawker, sedge darner, moorland hawker
*&quot;Aeshna mixta&quot; – migrant hawker
*&quot;Aeshna palmata&quot; – paddle-tailed darner
*&quot;Aeshna persephone&quot; – Persephone&#x27;s darner
*&quot;Aeshna petalura&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna septentrionalis&quot; – azure darner
*&quot;Aeshna serrata&quot; – Baltic hawker
*&quot;Aeshna shennong&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna sitchensis&quot; – zigzag darner
*&quot;Aeshna subarctica&quot; – bog hawker, subarctic darner
*&quot;Aeshna tuberculifera&quot; – black-tipped darner
*&quot;Aeshna umbrosa&quot; – shadow darner
*&quot;Aeshna vercanica&quot; 
*&quot;Aeshna verticalis&quot; – green-striped darner
*&quot;Aeshna viridis&quot; – green hawker
*&quot;Aeshna walkeri&quot; – Walker&#x27;s darner
*&quot;Aeshna williamsoniana&quot; – Williamson&#x27;s darner

<doc id="854525" wikidata="Q2266306" url="?curid=854525" title="Antics (album)">
<text>Antics is the second studio album by American rock band Interpol, released on September 27, 2004, by Matador Records. Upon its release, the album proved to be the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, peaking at number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart, and went on to be certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.

&quot;Antics&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; named it the best album of 2004. Likewise, it appeared on end-of-year lists by several other music publications. It was later certified gold by the RIAA in 2009. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Slow Hands&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;mere&quot;, and &quot;Narc&quot;.

In a 2018 interview with Vice, lead singer Paul Banks listed &quot;Antics&quot; as his favorite of the band&#x27;s albums, saying: &quot;I really put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears onto this record&quot; and that &quot;it felt like a very righteous pursuit&quot;. Banks also claimed that their confidence in the album&#x27;s quality acted as &quot;the perfect antidote to that sophomore slump&quot; and the group circumvented the pressure and was able to &quot;dive straight back in&quot;.

==Packaging==
Morse code is used in several places throughout the album&#x27;s packaging, continuing the nautical themes found in a few of the tracks&#x27; lyrics (&quot;Take You on a Cruise&quot;, &quot;Public Pervert&quot;, &quot;A Time to Be So Small&quot;). Code for the word &quot;antics&quot; is used on the back panel of the slipcase, as well as in the booklet; other words included in code are &quot;length&quot;, &quot;narc&quot;, &quot;cruise&quot;, and &quot;exit&quot;. Photography of the band used in the interior of the album was produced by Ami Barwell.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Antics&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received a Metascore of 80 based on 33 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. E! Online gave it an A and said, &quot;There&#x27;s something totally irresistible about &quot;Antics&quot;: The air of mystery, the bleak but hopeful arrangements and the melodies so sharp and moving that they might inspire a night of heroic partying.&quot; Josh Modell of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a favorable review and said that the album &quot;may be predictable, but if predictable means rock-solid and mostly magnificent, why bother asking for more?&quot; Mikael Wood of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also gave it a favorable review and said, &quot;What makes &quot;Antics&quot; such an improvement over &quot;Bright Lights&quot; is how capable Interpol have become at complementing Banks&#x27;s lovely ambiguity with an increasingly precise post-punk throb.&quot; Dan Tallis of BBC Music likewise gave it a favorable review and said, &quot;What&#x27;s inescapable is that &quot;Antics&quot; does sound similar to &quot;Turn On the Bright Lights&quot;. This is despite the drummer&#x27;s attempt to lift the gloom by introducing a poppy, even dance drum beat during two or three tracks. [...] However, this record has been widely praised. The difference is that Interpol have progressed. The band haven&#x27;t repeated the formula, they&#x27;ve improved upon it.&quot;

Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it four stars out of five, and said it &quot;manages to dabble with tension and still emerge with something life-affirming.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; also gave it four stars out of five and called it &quot;exhilarating, morbid, romantic, cool&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; gave it a score of eight out of ten, and called it &quot;an album scored through with a vehement beauty that, with each listen, becomes all the more acute for its unwillingness to shy away from life&#x27;s bleaker, more painful moments.&quot; Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music UK gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and called it &quot;a suppler record than its older brother, largely avoiding the skittish tempos of &quot;Turn On...&quot; tracks like &quot;Roland&quot; in favour of elegant curves and harmonies [...] though the road-honed likes of &quot;Slow Hands&quot; and &quot;Not Even Jail&quot; still hit bruisingly hard.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Under the Radar&quot; gave it eight stars out of ten, and said that while it is &quot;ultimately a more sophisticated record, it&#x27;s probably a less obvious one, too.&quot; Merek Cooper of Playlouder likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that Interpol &quot;no longer rely on dense production and atmospherics, because they don’t need to: &quot;Antics&quot; is bare-boned and beautiful.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a favorable review and called it &quot;even better [than &quot;Bright Lights&quot;], possibly because the band isn&#x27;t trying so hard to be weird.&quot; Salvatore Ciolfi of &quot;PopMatters&quot; also gave it eight stars out of ten and said, &quot;Altogether, the album&#x27;s feel is much more lively, bouncy, and accessible, and in combination with the band&#x27;s ubiquitous ambient underpinnings, the upbeat tone often makes this collection inspiring.&quot; Bobby Mann of &quot;Flak Magazine&quot; also gave it a favorable review and said that &quot;Interpol is less indebted to its influences, creating a distinct sound from the distinguishing characteristics that drew those comparisons in the first place.&quot;

Other reviews were average or mixed: &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album a score of three stars out of five, and called it &quot;Less lugubrious and more melodic than [&quot;Bright Lights&quot;], but the improvement is marginal.&quot; Amneziak of Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it three stars out of five and called it &quot;Very straightforward Interpol-lite.&quot; Mark Richardson of &quot;Paste&quot; likewise gave the album three stars out of five and said that its songs &quot;feel heavy and significant enough--due to dynamic production and hooky choruses--even if we don&#x27;t know exactly what they mean.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it an average review and called it &quot;fairly uneven&quot;. Andre Perry of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; gave the album a mixed review and said, &quot;I&#x27;d be overstating myself to posit &quot;Antics&quot; as a wholly offensive listening experience. Yes, I get it: this record actually sounds okay when it&#x27;s being played in the background at a house party or at the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bar. But that&#x27;s as good as it gets: &quot;background music&quot;.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four and said, &quot;The band works too hard to seem mysterious.&quot; Christopher Gray of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, and said that if the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t exactly blaze off in bold new directions, it does offer an opportunity for Interpol to do some fine-tuning (not that they need much) and settle comfortably into their black, velvet-lined pocket.&quot; Robert Christgau of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; named &quot;Next Exit&quot; as the only good song on the album.

==Early life and education==
Ronald N. Perlman was born on April 13, 1950, in Washington Heights, New York City. His mother, Dorothy (née Rosen), was a municipal employee, and his father, Bertram &quot;Bert&quot; Perlman, was a jazz drummer and television repairman. His family is Jewish, originally from Hungary and Poland, and Perlman had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.

Perlman said in 1988, &quot;It was not a bad childhood but I had a perception of myself that was... I was terribly overweight as a young kid, and it was sort of a low self image.&quot; He stated this experience is something that attracts him to roles where he portrays &quot;these sorts of deformed people who are very endearing.&quot; Perlman had a &quot;very close&quot; relationship with his father, who convinced his son he &quot;had to&quot; pursue a career as an actor after seeing him perform in a college production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. 

Perlman graduated from George Washington High School in 1967 and Lehman College in 1971. He later attended the University of Minnesota, where he graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in theater arts in 1973.

Annaud later revealed that when he contacted Perlman to ask him about playing Salvatore in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), Perlman was thinking of abandoning his career. After various minor and supporting roles in film and television, he got his breakthrough leading role as Vincent on the television series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, opposite Linda Hamilton, from 1987 to 1990. This earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series in 1989.

They separated in May 2019 and Perlman later filed for divorce. In 2022, Perlman married his &quot;StartUp&quot; co-star Allison Dunbar in Italy after three years of dating. His son Brandon produces electronic music under the stage name Delroy Edwards.

Perlman is a lifelong Democrat. He has been a vocal critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose son Donald Trump Jr. called Perlman &quot;a coward&quot; for allegedly being aware of Weinstein&#x27;s sexual abuses on several women in the entertainment industry and staying silent about it. In 2018, Perlman claimed that he intentionally urinated on his hand prior to shaking Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s hand followed by the message &quot;I think about that every time lil Donnie opens up his KFC.&quot;

On November 9, 2016, Perlman announced via Facebook his intention to run for U.S. President in the 2020 election. In January 2019, he endorsed the candidacy of Kamala Harris. Perlman spoke in support of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and criticized an executive from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers who said that the association should delay negotiations with striking workers until they began to lose their homes.

<text>Girolamo Muziano or Mutiani ( – 1592), was an Italian painter, one of the most prominent artists active in Rome in the mid-to-late sixteenth century.

==Life==
He was born in Acquafredda, near Brescia, but worked mainly in Rome.

Accounts from the 16th to 20th centuries said that Muziano began work under the tutelage of Romanino, an imitator of Titian. Yet, a nearly autobiographical story of Muziano written by his confessor (unpublished until 1954) indicates instead that Muziano was born in Brescia, and left this town as a young man, and that his first apprenticeship was under Domenico Campagnola and Lambert Sustris in 1544–46 in the town of Padua. He then spent time in Venice until 1549, but moved permanently to Rome about 1550.

Landscapes figured prominently in Muziano&#x27;s early work, leading the Romans to nickname him &quot;Il giovane dei paesi&quot; (the young man of the landscapes). Although he produced drawings and paintings in this genre throughout his career, his interest shifted towards grand manner figure painting. 
Muziano painted religious and historical subjects in a style based largely on Michelangelo, giving great prominence to the monumental anatomy of his figures, even in works depicting ascetic saints. 
His &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus&quot; (1555), painted for the Colonna palace in Subiaco, established his fame. Michelangelo himself pronounced its author one of the &quot;first artists of that age&quot;. The painting was later placed in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore above Muziano&#x27;s tomb; it was afterwards transferred to the Quirinal Palace, and now is in the Vatican Pinacoteca. Its techniques of spatial organization and narrative composition are more typical of the High Renaissance than of Muziano&#x27;s Mannerist contemporaries.

Muziano came to be the leading artist in Rome during the 1570-80s, painting in a style that appealed to Counter-Reformation patrons. He worked for Cardinal Ippolito II d&#x27;Este from 1560 to 1566, and his frescoes for the Cardinal&#x27;s villas in Tivoli could be seen in Villa d&#x27;Este.

His most noted paintings include &quot;Circumcision,&quot; formerly the high altarpiece in the church of the Gesù (although now removed to a corridor behind the sacristy), paintings for three chapels in Santa Maria in Aracoeli, and &quot;St Jerome preaching to Monks in the Desert&quot; in Santa Maria degli Angeli. This last painting was one of two altarpieces that Muziano painted for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica during his time as superintendent of works for Pope Gregory XIII (the other painting, a &quot;Mass of St. Basil&quot;, is lost, although it is recorded in an etching by Jacques Callot). Muziano also designed mosaics for the Gregorian Chapel in the basilica, and was responsible for re-founding the &quot;Academy of St Luke&quot; (Accademia di San Luca) in Rome (1577). His works can also be seen in Santa Caterina dei Funari, the Palazzo Colonna (&quot;portrait of Vittoria Colonna&quot;), the Cathedral Museum of Orvieto, and the church of San Francesco in Frascati.

Muziano died in 1592, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Among his pupils were Paolo Rossetti of Cento and Cesare Nebbia.

<text>Paul Benjamin Mendelsohn (born 3 April 1969) is an Australian actor. He first rose to prominence in Australia for his break-out role in &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot; (1987). He gained international attention for his starring role in the crime drama &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; (2010). He has since had roles in films such as &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), &quot;Starred Up&quot; (2013), &quot;Lost River&quot; (2014), &quot;Mississippi Grind&quot; (2015), &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016), &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; (2017) and &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018). 

Mendelsohn starred in the Netflix drama series &quot;Bloodline&quot; (2015–2017), for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016. He played the Sheriff of Nottingham in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2018). He joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Talos in the superhero film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; (2019) and the Disney+ series &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; (2023). He has also starred in the HBO crime miniseries &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2020). In 2024, he began portraying fashion designer Christian Dior in the television series &quot;The New Look&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Mendelsohn was born in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Carole Ann (née Ferguson) and Frederick Arthur Oscar Mendelsohn. His father is a prominent medical researcher who previously headed the Howard Florey Institute in Melbourne, where he maintains the status of Professor Emeritus. Ben and his two brothers, Tom and David, as well as his mother (deceased), a registered nurse, lived in Europe and the United States for long periods of time, and returned to Melbourne when he was in primary school. He attended Mercersburg Academy in the U.S. before attending Heidelberg Primary School and Eltham High School and Banyule High (now Viewbank College). He took drama because he thought it was an easy class. Mendelsohn was the only one of his friends to follow up with an audition for Crawford Productions that was being advertised.

In October 2009, he was featured in an episode of the Australian series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which traced the ancestry of his paternal grandfather Oscar Mendelsohn, who was from a Jewish family. It also found convicts on his mother&#x27;s side. Searching for a connection to composer Felix Mendelssohn, which was eventually dismissed, he discovered links to 19th-century Prussia. His paternal ancestors were among the first Prussian Jews to be naturalised in Schneidemühl in the province of Posen, now Piła in modern Poland. He also has Greek, German and British ancestry.

==Career==
After several early television roles, including &quot;The Henderson Kids&quot; alongside Kylie Minogue, he attracted notice in his break-out film, &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot; (1987), and won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next major role was in &quot;The Big Steal&quot; (1990), and &quot;Spotswood&quot; (1992), co-starring with Anthony Hopkins; this was followed in 1994 by &quot;Metal Skin&quot; and in 1996 by &quot;Cosi&quot; and &quot;Idiot Box&quot;. In 2000, he was in two contrasting films, the Australian &quot;Mullet&quot; and the Hollywood &quot;Vertical Limit&quot;.

In 2005, he was preparing to play Mark Antony in the Sydney Theatre Company-produced &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and he was in the Terrence Malick-directed film &quot;The New World&quot;.

Mendelsohn starred in the second (2005) and third (2006) season of the TV series &quot;Love My Way&quot;, and in 2008, he appeared in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Australia&quot;. He starred in the first season of the Melbourne TV series &quot;Tangle&quot;, which premiered on Showcase in 2009. In 2009, he appeared in the American science fiction film &quot;Knowing&quot; directed by Alex Proyas. The same year, Mendelsohn starred as Ned in &quot;Beautiful Kate&quot;, directed by Rachel Ward, opposite Bryan Brown and Rachel Griffiths.

In 2010, he appeared in &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;, starring in the film as Andrew &quot;Pope&quot; Cody, a criminal on the run from the law living in the notorious Melbourne Underworld. The role won him many awards, including IF Award&#x27;s Best Actor and the AFI&#x27;s award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He was also named by GQ Australia as Actor of the Year for 2010.

Mendelsohn was selected as one of the subjects in the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Australia&quot; 2012 edition. In 2012, Mendelsohn played the supporting roles of villain John Daggett in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and Robin Van Der Hook in Derek Cianfrance&#x27;s &quot;The Place Beyond the Pines&quot;.

In 2012, he appeared in Florence + the Machine&#x27;s music video for &quot;Lover to Lover&quot;. The video was directed by Vincent Haycock. In 2013, he guest starred in the TV series &quot;Girls&quot; as the father of Jessa, played by Jemima Kirke. The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed &quot;Starred Up&quot;, directed by David MacKenzie, for which he won Best Supporting Actor at the British Independent Film Awards.

In 2014, Mendelsohn joined the cast of &quot;Bloodline&quot;, a Netflix original from the creators of &quot;Damages&quot;. The first season premiered on the site on 20 March 2015 and was well received. Mendelsohn&#x27;s performance on the series was lauded by critics, resulting in a Primetime Emmy Award win as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination. In September 2016, Netflix announced that the show had been cancelled, and that it would end after its third season in 2017. Season 3 of &quot;Bloodline&quot; received negative reviews, and Mendelsohn appeared in two episodes of it.

In 2016, he appeared in video as an onstage &quot;stand-in&quot; during the Nostalgic For the Present concert tour of Australian singer Sia, for her song &quot;Breathe Me&quot;.

He portrayed the villain Director Krennic in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise&#x27;s &quot;Rogue One&quot; in 2016. He called the opportunity to act in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;a childhood dream come true&quot;. A couple of years later in 2018, he played the role of Nolan Sorrento in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. In 2018, he starred in the film &quot;The Land of Steady Habits&quot;. He was cast in the role of Talos in Marvel&#x27;s film &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; alongside Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson. He reprised the role for a brief cameo in &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;, also in 2019.

In 2020, Mendelsohn starred in the lead role in the HBO crime miniseries &quot;The Outsider&quot;. In December 2020, it was announced he would be reprising his role as Talos, along with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, in the Disney+ series &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mendelsohn married British-American journalist Emma Forrest in June 2012. He has a daughter with Forrest, born in 2014, and another daughter from a previous relationship, Sophia Wright-Mendelsohn, who is also an actor. He and Forrest divorced in 2016.

<doc id="854547" wikidata="Q3547372" url="?curid=854547" title="USS Argus (1803)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Argus, originally namedUSS &quot;Merrimack, was a brig in the United States Navy commissioned in 1803. She enforced the Embargo Act of 1807 and fought in the First Barbary War – taking part in the blockade of Tripoli and the capture of Derna – and the War of 1812. During the latter conflict, she had been audaciously raiding British merchant shipping in British home waters for a month, when the heavier British intercepted her. After a sharp fight during which &quot;Argus&quot;″s captain, Master Commandant William Henry Allen, was mortally wounded, &quot;Argus&quot; surrendered when the crew of &quot;Pelican&quot; were about to board.

==Construction and commissioning==
The United States Congress authorized construction of the brig, originally named USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;, the second U.S. Navy ship of that name, on 23 February 1803, and on 29 April 1803 the U.S. Navy contracted with the shipyard of Edmund Hartt at Boston, Massachusetts, to construct the ship. Edmund Hartt″s brother, Joseph Hartt, drafted the plans for the brig, designed with a flush deck and fine lines to optimize her for sailing conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Captain Edward Preble was appointed superintendent of her construction, and her keel was laid down at Hartt″s yard on 12 May, 1803. 

On 14 May 1803, two days after &quot;Merrimack&quot;″s keel was laid, United States Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith assigned Preble to duty as commanding officer of the frigate , then at Boston, in addition to his duties related to &quot;Merrimack&quot;″s construction. Smith informed Preble on 21 May 1803 that Preble was to take command of the U.S. Navy″s Mediterranean Squadron, which was to include &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;Merrimack&quot;, and on 27 May ordered Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, Jr. to take command of &quot;Merrimack&quot; and supervise her construction to allow Preble to focus on preparing &quot;Constitution&quot; for Mediterranean service.

Smith found that U.S. Navy officers disliked the name &quot;Merrimack&quot; for the new brig, and he directed that she be renamed &quot;Argus&quot;, the first U.S. Navy ship of that name, on 4 June 1803. Although work on her construction proceeded quickly at first, Decatur reported on 11 July 1803 soon after arriving to take command that her construction had fallen behind schedule, although her builders assured him that she would be launched before the end of July. Decatur recruited her crew and procured her armament from Providence, Rhode Island, but by the beginning of August 1803 heavy and persistent rains had delayed her launching by two weeks. Her launch day finally came on 20 August 1803, but the attempt to launch her failed when she did not move down the ways. After the ways″ degree of incline was increased, &quot;Argus&quot; was successfully launched on 21 August 1803. Labor problems during her fitting out then delayed her completion but, though no document recording the date of her commissioning has been found, she was in commission and ready for sea by early September 1803.

In service, &quot;Argus&quot; was reported to sail swiftly and easily, although prone to heavy pitching when lying to (i.e., when her sails were arranged so as to counteract each other). On more than one occasion, observers described her as a remarkably handsome ship.

==First Barbary War==
&quot;Argus&quot; set sail from Boston on 8 September 1803, bound for the Mediterranean and service with the Mediterranean Squadron in the First Barbary War. She soon suffered a badly sprung bowsprit in exceptionally heavy seas, and Decatur put into Newport, Rhode Island, on 18 September 1803 to have it fixed, reasoning that repairs would be far easier in the United States than in the Mediterranean. She returned to sea on 28 September 1803 and set a course for Gibraltar, where she arrived after a transatlantic voyage on 1 November 1803. There, Decatur exchanged commands with Lieutenant Isaac Hull, relinquishing command of &quot;Argus&quot; to Hull and relieving Hull of command of the schooner on 9 November, as was ordered on 7 November.

&quot;Argus&quot; made a brief cruise to the east and then, in accordance with orders from now-Commodore Preble, commander of the Mediterranean Squadron, returned to Gibraltar to watch the Moroccans while the rest of the squadron sailed east to blockade Tripoli. During the early part of 1804, she cruised the western Mediterranean in an unsuccessful search for a Tripolitan cruiser reportedly operating in that area. In March 1804, she received orders to join the rest of the squadron off Tripoli.

===Blockade of Tripoli===
 Her boats captured a small sloop loaded with earthenware anchored close to the Tripoli coast on 30 April, 1804. &quot;Argus&quot; arrived off Tripoli in company with &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On 31 May she captured Ketch &quot;Virgine Del Rosario&quot; leaving Tripoli. She left the blockade late in the month of June to join a neutral ship at Syracuse, Sicily, and escort her back to Tripoli with supplies for the captive officers and crew of the frigate which had been taken by the Tripolitans after she had run aground on an uncharted reef off Tripoli in October 1803.

&quot;Argus&quot; resumed her blockade duties on 7 July 1804. At that point, Preble began preparations for a shore bombardment. Heavy weather, however, postponed the action until early August. On 3 August 1804, the squadron moved in to provide long-range support for the gunboats and mortar boats actually engaged in the bombardment. The bombardment was considerably less damaging to the defensive works protecting Tripoli than hoped for, though the American gunboat crews boarded and carried several of the Tripolitan vessels sent out to engage them. The squadron conducted another ineffectual bombardment of Tripoli on 7 August 1804. Two days later, Commodore Preble embarked in &quot;Argus&quot; to reconnoiter Tripoli harbor. During that mission, Tripolitan shore batteries fired upon &quot;Argus&quot;, and she was struck below the waterline by a single shot. Fortunately for her, the shot did not pass all the way through her hull, and she remained on station off Tripoli.

On 28 August 1804, the squadron conducted a third bombardment of the defenses of Tripoli in which its guns inflicted severe damage. A week later, on the night of 4 September 1804, &quot;Argus&quot; was among the ships that escorted the ill-fated fire ship to the entrance of Tripoli harbor. When &quot;Intrepid&quot; blew up prematurely, killing her entire crew, &quot;Argus&quot; remained there to pick up survivors, but none had appeared by sunrise when she returned to her blockade station.

===Capture of Derna===
Through the winter of 1804–1805, &quot;Argus&quot; alternated between blockade duty off Tripoli and periods in port at Malta and Syracuse. In the spring of 1805, she participated in one of the more celebrated episodes of American naval history, the capture of Derna. During the preceding months, she had made several voyages to Egypt in support of Consul William Eaton″s efforts to raise a force of men to take Derna in conjunction with the deposed pasha. After a march of over 600 miles (970 km) across the Libyan Desert in what is now Libya, the polyglot army – there were only 10 Americans in the whole force – arrived at Derna on 25 April 1805. &quot;Argus&quot; had met the army a day or two earlier at the Gulf of Bomba to provide provisions. Now, she made preparations to provide bombardment assistance for the landward assault.

Eaton″s force launched its attack on Derna on 27 April 1805. &quot;Argus&quot; and the schooner anchored about half a mile (800 meters) to the eastward of the fortifications. The Tripolitans opened fire almost immediately upon &quot;Argus&quot; and the sloop-of-war , anchored quite a bit nearer than &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;. By 14:45 that afternoon, gunfire from the ships silenced all of the guns in the city. A desperate charge led by United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Presley O&#x27;Bannon managed to carry the gun batteries by storm and breathed new life into the assault. After hoisting the American flag over the battlements, O&#x27;Bannon ordered the already loaded captured guns to be turned on the town. By 16:00 that afternoon, the entire town had fallen to Eaton&#x27;s army, and the enemy fled to the hinterland. The capture of Derna has been immortalized in the words of the &quot;Marines&#x27; Hymn&quot; (&quot;... &quot;to the shores of Tripoli&quot;&quot;).

After Eaton&#x27;s and O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s victory, a Tripolitan army, which had been sent to reinforce the town, arrived and began preparations to retake Derna. &quot;Argus&quot; remained offshore to provide gunfire support in the defense of the town throughout the occupation of Derna. When the Tripolitans finally assaulted the town on 13 May 1805, &quot;Argus&quot; joined in the fray and enabled the defensive forces narrowly to beat back the charging enemy troops. &quot;Argus&quot;″s guns wreaked havoc among the enemy forces during their headlong retreat. Between that time and early June 1805, the Tripolitans made a few more half-hearted approaches during which &quot;Argus&quot;″s long 12-pounders (5 kg) came into play. However, things remained relatively quiet, for negotiations with the pasha in power were already underway. On 11 June 1805, orders arrived for Eaton″s force to evacuate Derna as negotiations had been concluded. The troops and the deposed pasha were embarked in &quot;Constellation&quot; that evening, and &quot;Argus&quot; and the other American ships quit the area.

==Operations, 1805–1812==
&quot;Argus&quot; continued to cruise the Mediterranean until the summer of 1806. She returned to the United States at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., on 13 July 1806 and was laid up there in ordinary. In 1807, she was fitted out at the Washington Navy Yard, returned to full commission, and began a series of cruises along the Atlantic coast of the United States to enforce the Embargo Act of 1807, which she continued through the outbreak of the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom in June 1812.

==War of 1812==
After the outbreak of war, &quot;Argus&quot; continued her cruises off the U.S. Atlantic coast. During one cruise between 8 October 1812 and 3 January 1813, she captured six valuable prizes and eluded an entire British squadron during a three-day stern chase. Through clever handling, she even managed to take one of the prizes as she was fleeing from the overwhelmingly superior British force.

===Capture by HMS &quot;Pelican&quot;===

====Prelude====
Under the command of Master Commandant William Henry Allen, &quot;Argus&quot; broke out of New York Harbor on 18 June 1813, eluding the British blockade. Her mission was not warlike to begin with; it was to deliver William H. Crawford to his post as Minister to the First French Empire. &quot;Argus&quot; arrived at Lorient in Brittany, France, on 11 July 1813, disembarked Crawford, and put out to sea again three days later to begin raiding British shipping in the English Channel and Irish Sea. During the next month, she captured nineteen merchant ships. Rather than weaken his crew by sending the captured ships to American, French, or neutral ports under prize crews, Allen set most of the captured ships on fire. The intense operations exhausted &quot;Argus&quot;″s crew.

The shipping losses soon caused insurance rates for merchant shipping to increase greatly. The cargo on the sunken ships was worth about two million dollars. The British Admiralty sent orders to all available ships to hunt down &quot;Argus&quot;. The British brig-sloop had just arrived in Cork Harbour in Ireland, having escorted a convoy from the West Indies, and immediately put to sea again on 10 August 1813. &quot;Pelican&quot;″s captain was Commander John Fordyce Maple, an officer who had joined the Royal Navy when twelve years old in 1782, two years before William Henry Allen was born.

On 13 August, &quot;Argus&quot; took two final prizes. One of them was from Oporto, Portugal, and was carrying wine. Both American and British historians have suggested that &quot;Argus&quot;″s crew looted some of the cargo, and that their debauched state affected their performance during the coming battle with &quot;Pelican&quot;. As with &quot;Argus&quot;″s previous captures, the Americans set fire to the prize; unfortunately for them, &quot;Pelican&quot; was near enough to sight the smoke from the burning vessel and make for it.

====Battle and capture====
At 05:00 on the morning of 14 August 1813, &quot;Argus&quot; and &quot;Pelican&quot; sighted each other five leagues (about 15 miles) west of St David&#x27;s Head. &quot;Argus&quot; was the faster but more lightly armed vessel, with eighteen 24-pounder carronades and a 12-pounder chase gun against the &quot;Pelican&quot;″s sixteen 32-pounder carronades, one 12-pounder long gun, and two 6-pounder long guns. Allen could have used &quot;Argus&quot;″s greater speed to escape. Instead, he accepted battle. Allen″s decision to accept battle against a heavier opponent stemmed from confidence gained while he was the first lieutenant of the frigate when she captured the British frigate on 25 October 1812; following his promotion he had said that he could &quot;take any British 22-gun sloop-of-war in ten minutes.&quot;

The wind was from the south, giving &quot;Pelican&quot; the weather gauge (i.e. the windward position). Allen sailed westward on the port tack (i.e., with the wind to port) and opposed his port side battery to &quot;Pelican&#x27;s&quot; starboard battery.

Four minutes after the ships exchanged their first broadsides, Allen lost a leg. His first lieutenant was also badly wounded, and &quot;Argus&quot;″s rigging was badly cut up. &quot;Pelican&quot; tried to cross &quot;Argus&quot;″s stern to deliver raking fire but &quot;Argus&quot;″s second lieutenant, William Howard Allen (not related to the commanding officer), threw his sails aback to slow the American brig and instead raked &quot;Pelican&quot;. This did not fatally cripple the British vessel, and the two brigs continued to exchange broadsides, with &quot;Pelican&quot; now to leeward. After four more minutes, &quot;Argus&quot;″s rigging was too badly damaged for the Americans to prevent &quot;Pelican&quot; from crossing &quot;Argus&quot;″s stern and delivering several raking broadsides.
Finally, three-quarters of an hour after the action began, the two vessels came into contact, &quot;Argus&quot;″s bow against &quot;Pelican&quot;″s quarter. British boarding parties mustered, but before they could board &quot;Argus&quot; the Americans surrendered.

Unusually for the War of 1812, the American gunnery in this engagement was comparatively ineffective, although &quot;Pelican&quot;″s sides were &quot;filled with grapeshot&quot; and two of &quot;Pelican&quot;″s carronades had been dismounted. British gunnery was &quot;at least of the standard which had brought victory in a hundred victories against the French.&quot;

====Aftermath====
&quot;Pelican&quot; and the captured &quot;Argus&quot; went in to Plymouth, England. Allen died there of his wounds a week after the battle. He was buried with full military honors. The rest of the crew, including sailing master Uriah P. Levy, were held as prisoners of war in England for the duration of the war. 

In 1813, construction commenced for a replacement 18-gun brig &quot;Argus&quot; at the Washington Naval Yard — but the ship was destroyed in the burning of Washington the following year before it could be launched.

<doc id="854549" wikidata="Q7313840" url="?curid=854549" title="Renée Geyer">
<text>Renée Rebecca Geyer (11 September 195317 January 2023) was an Australian singer who was an acclaimed jazz, soul and R&amp;B musician. She released 15 studio albums with &quot;Moving Along&quot; (1977) and &quot;Tenderland&quot; (2003) both reaching number 11 on the Australian charts. Geyer&#x27;s singles success as a solo artist in Australia were with &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Heading in the Right Direction&quot; and &quot;Stares and Whispers&quot; in the 1970s and &quot;Say I Love You&quot; in the 1980s. The latter also reached number one in New Zealand. The singer was an internationally respected and sought-after backing vocalist, whose session credits include work with Sting, Chaka Khan, Toni Childs, Joe Cocker, Neil Diamond, Men at Work and Trouble Funk.

Geyer&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Difficult Woman&quot; (2000), co-written with music journalist Ed Nimmervoll detailed her drug addictions, sex life and career in music. She described herself as &quot;a white Hungarian Jew from Australia sounding like a 65-year-old black man from Alabama.&quot; She spent more than 10 years based in the United States while working as a session vocalist, but had little chart success there under her own name. Geyer returned to Australia in the mid-1990s and her career continued into the 21st century. Rock historian Ian McFarlane described Geyer as having a &quot;rich, soulful, passionate and husky vocal delivery&quot;. Her status in the Australian music industry was recognised when she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 14 July 2005. Geyer and fellow 1970s singer Marcia Hines are the subjects of Australian academic Jon Stratton&#x27;s 2008 cultural studies article &quot;A Jew Singing Like a Black Woman In Australia&quot;. Geyer died of lung cancer which was attributed to her long addiction to smoking cigarettes.

==Biography==

===1953–1973: Early years===
Renée Rebecca Geyer, was born on 11 September 1953 in Melbourne, to a Hungarian-Jewish father, Edward Geyer (1920–2013), and a Slovak-Jewish mother, Gabriella (1926–2017), a Holocaust survivor, as the youngest of three children. The couple had met in Palestine and migrated to Melbourne in 1951 where her father managed the Warsaw Centre. Geyer was named Renée after another Holocaust survivor who had helped her mother in Auschwitz after Josef Mengele had assigned the rest of her mother&#x27;s family to death. In 1955 the Geyers moved to Sydney where her parents were managers of Komlos Hostel, Greenwich until 1963—thereafter they started their own Geyer Kosher catering service. Both elder siblings were academically gifted, but Geyer described herself as a problem child, while her parents called her &quot;übermutig&quot; (German for &quot;reckless&quot;). She attended various schools and was expelled from a private school, Methodist Ladies College, for petty stealing. Her first job was as a receptionist for the Australian Law Society.

In 1970, at the age of 16, while still at Sydney Girls High School or at Dover Heights Girls&#x27; High, Geyer began her singing career as a vocalist with jazz-blues band Dry Red. The group worked at Kask Wine Bar, Bondi; where she earned $5 a night her father disapproved of her chosen career, &quot;[he] said if I was going to do that, I was not going to live at home. So to make peace I moved out. I left home—and school... I got a job singing in a bar straight away, and my mum made sure I did not go hungry.&quot; Dry Red also contained Eric McCusker (later of Mondo Rock). For her audition she sang the Bee Gees&#x27; hit &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;. She left Dry Red for other bands and in 1971 joined the more accomplished jazz-rock group Sun.

With Geyer, Sun&#x27;s line-up was George Almanza (piano), Henry Correy (bass guitar), Gary Norwell (drums), Keith Shadwick (saxophone, flute, clarinet, vocals) and Chris Sonnenberg (guitar). The group released one studio album with Geyer, &quot;Sun 1972&quot; in August 1972 but she departed before it appeared and was replaced by Starlee Ford on lead vocals. In 2022 a four-disc album by various Sun line-ups, &quot;Rehearsal Recordings Album&quot;, was issued. John Shand of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; observed, &quot;[on Geyer&#x27;s tracks] you hear the tug of war between her R&amp;B comfort zone and the freer, jazzier, moodier pieces... [including] diving to the depths of her range, and singing with such bruising power as summons a sudden blazing guitar solo.&quot;

Late in 1972 Geyer joined Mother Earth whose R&amp;B, soul music style was more in keeping with Geyer&#x27;s idiom. Mother Earth consisted of Geyer, Jim Kelly (guitar), David Lindsay (bass guitar), John Proud (drums) and Mark Punch (guitar, vocals). Lindsay, Proud and Punch had all been members of Nine Stage Horizon, while Kelly was from Levi Smith&#x27;s Clefs. By the start of the following year Harry Brus had replaced Lindsay on bass guitar and Russell Dunlop replaced Proud on drums. Although the group performed on ABC-TV&#x27;s popular music show &quot;GTK&quot; they did not record any material under their own name.

===1973–1976: &quot;Renée Geyer&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Ready to Deal&quot;===
In 1973 Geyer was signed to RCA Records, which had released Sun&#x27;s album the year before. Already showing signs of her self-proclaimed &quot;Difficult Woman&quot; tag, Geyer loyally insisted that her Mother Earth bandmates back her on her solo recordings and used Brus on bass guitar, Dunlop on drums, Kelly on electric and acoustic guitars and Punch on electric and acoustic guitars; as well as Almanza on piano and Bobby Gebbert on piano. Her self-titled debut studio album was released in September 1973 which mostly consisted of R&amp;B/Soul cover versions of overseas hits and was produced by Gus McNeil at ATA Studios, Sydney. &quot;The Australian Jewish Times&quot;″ writer praised her &quot;superb vocal talents&quot; and recognised her as an &quot;exciting and talented new star.&quot; Geyer left Mother Earth by the end of the year.

Geyer&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; (August 1974), was produced by Tweed Harris (ex-the Groove). Aside from Harris on keyboards it was recorded with Mike Brady on backing vocals, Bobby Bright on backing vocals, Geoff Cox on drums, Tim Gaze on guitar and Phil Manning on guitar. It became her first charting album when it peaked at No. 28 in October on the Kent Music Report. The title track, &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; (November), is a cover version of James Brown&#x27;s 1965 hit and became her first top 50 single at No. 44.

By December 1974 Geyer had joined with jazz-funk group Sanctuary to tour her second album. Sanctuary&#x27;s original line-up was Billy Green on guitar (ex-Doug Parkinson in Focus) together with ex-Chain members Barry Harvey on drums, Mal Logan on keyboards and Barry Sullivan on bass guitar. Geyer was disenchanted with RCA&#x27;s refusal to allow her to record more original material, she was prepared to wait out her contract. However, former Chain members convinced Geyer to contact their label, Mushroom Records&#x27; boss Michael Gudinski and talent manager Ray Evans to strike a deal so they would record her and RCA would release her material with a Mushroom logo.

This arrangement led to Geyer&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Ready to Deal&quot;, which was recorded in August–September 1975, with Sanctuary renamed Renée Geyer Band with the line-up Logan, Sullivan, Mark Punch on guitar (ex-Mother Earth) and Greg Tell on drums. They co-wrote most of the material for the album; the album was released in November to reach No. 21. It provided one of Geyer&#x27;s signature songs &quot;Heading in the Right Direction&quot;, written by Punch and Garry Paige (both ex-the Johnny Rocco Band), which reached the top 40 in 1976. Geyer reflected on the local music scene, &quot;The sort of music I like and the band is into is not very popular yet in Australia.&quot; She expected to &quot;go overseas to make a name, and money.&quot;

Geyer participated in the 1975 federal election campaign for the Liberal Party, singing their theme song &quot;Turn on the Lights&quot;. In later years she distanced herself from the Liberals and politics in general, stating she had done their theme song to earn enough money to record an album in the United States, where she had signed a contract with Polydor Records. Before departing Mick Rogers on guitar (ex-Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band) replaced Punch and Renée Geyer Band recorded a live album, &quot;Really Really Love You&quot;, at their farewell concert in Melbourne&#x27;s Dallas Brooks Hall on 11 April 1976. It was released in August and reach the top 50; &quot;Shaky Ground&quot;, the related single, appeared in September. Geyer had relocated to the Los Angeles mid-1976.

===1977–1979: USA, &quot;Moving Along&quot;, &quot;Winning&quot; and &quot;Blues License&quot;===
In May 1977 Geyer released her fourth studio album &quot;Moving Along&quot; on RCA/Mushroom Records, which peaked at No. 11 in Australia. It used Motown Records producer Frank Wilson, with the album&#x27;s Polydor Records release for the US market re-titled &quot;Renée Geyer&quot;. Her backing musicians, Logan and Sullivan were supplemented by members of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s band, as well as Ray Parker Jr. and other US session musicians. According to &quot;Cashbox&quot;″ reviewer it showcased the &quot;dynamic interpretive qualities in her voice and material that ranges from disco to MOR... she seems poised and ready for a listen by the Yanks.&quot; It provided Geyer&#x27;s biggest Australian hit single, at the time, with &quot;Stares and Whispers&quot; (April) peaking at No. 17. In the US, radio stations began playing several of the album&#x27;s tracks, in particular her re-recorded version of &quot;Heading in the Right Direction&quot;, which was issued as her first US &amp; UK single.

Polydor were aware that her vocal style led listeners to incorrectly assume she was black and urged her to keep a low profile until her popularity had grown, thus they suggested her US album release should not include her photograph. Known for her uncompromising and direct personal manner, Geyer refused to accede to such deception and insisted on marketing with a cover photograph of what she referred to as &quot;my big pink huge face&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release, interest in Geyer as a solo artist subsided in the US, which she later blamed on the headstrong decision regarding marketing. Nevertheless, Geyer earned respect in the US recording industry as a session vocalist for several years working in Los Angeles while periodically returning to Australia. In Australia in late 1977, Geyer released the single &quot;Restless Years&quot;, the theme song for the Ten Network&#x27;s TV soapie &quot;The Restless Years&quot;, with its writer Mike Perjanik. &quot;Restless Years&quot; reached the top 40 in early 1978. Mushroom released her compilation album, &quot;Renée Geyer at Her Very Best&quot; in November 1977, which peaked at No. 53.

In 1978 Geyer voiced Christine for Walter Murphy&#x27;s concept album &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Amy Hanson of AllMusic found Murphy&#x27;s vocal tracks to be &quot;at best drab and lifeless, and frequently droning and dire.&quot; In December of that year Geyer released her fifth studio album &quot;Winner&quot;; backing her were Punch, Tell and Tim Partridge on bass guitar (of Kevin Borich Express), together with session musicians. The artist was unhappy with its mix and the lack of support from Polydor—she negotiated a release from her contract, brought the master tapes to Australia where it was remixed and released. Geyer referred to &quot;Winner&quot; as &quot;a bit of a loser&quot; as its material was not up to standard. Despite touring Australia promoting it, neither the album nor related singles reached the top 50.

For her next studio album, &quot;Blues License&quot; (June 1979), she combined with Australian guitarist Kevin Borich and his band Express to perform straight blues material. The added fire in her vocals was sparked by harder edged backing from the group and additional musicians: Logan, Punch, Kerrie Biddell on backing vocals (Brian Cadd band) and Tim Piper on guitar (ex-Chain, Blackfeather). Geyer and Logan produced the album at Trafalgar Studios, Melbourne. It reached the top 50, and became a fan favourite.

===1980–1984: &quot;So Lucky&quot;, &quot;Renée Live&quot; and &quot;Faves&quot;===
In 1981 Geyer recorded her seventh studio album &quot;So Lucky&quot; at Shangri-La Studios, Malibu, California. Helmed by Rob Fraboni (The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, The Band) and Ricky Fataar (Beach Boys), the album moved her genre from soul and added a tougher, rootsy rock/R&amp;B style, while incorporating salsa and reggae. Garry Raffaele of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; described it as &quot;hard-driving, powerful, emotive rock&quot; with her vocals depicting &quot;an edge so hard yet so sensual as to be alarming.&quot; The lead single &quot;Say I Love You&quot; was released in May and became her biggest hit when it reached No. 5 on the Australian charts and No. 1 in New Zealand. &quot;So Lucky&quot; was released in November 1981 and provided two further singles, &quot;Do You Know What I Mean&quot; (December 1981), which reached the Australian and New Zealand top 30s and &quot;I Can Feel the Fire&quot; (February 1982).

Geyer performed in Mushroom&#x27;s 10th anniversary celebration, the Mushroom Evolution Concert on Australia Day (26 January) long week-end in 1982 at the Myer Music Bowl. &quot;So Lucky&quot; was released internationally by Portrait Records as &quot;Renée Geyer&quot; by Renée Geyer and the Bump Band in 1982. Also in that year Mushroom re-issued her previous albums. In the following year, Geyer released her second live album &quot;Renée Live&quot; in May, which included a duet with Glenn Shorrock (of Little River Band) on a cover version of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s 1966 single &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;. In November Mushroom released a second compilation album, &quot;Faves&quot;, which concluded her contract. Geyer returned to the US late in 1983 and concentrated on the Los Angeles musical scene. During the 1980s she also undertook minor acting roles in Australian feature films &quot;Starstruck&quot; (1982) and &quot;My First Wife&quot; (1984) and TV series &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; (1984).

===1985–1991: United States, &quot;Sing to Me&quot;, &quot;Renée Live at the Basement&quot; and Easy Pieces===
Geyer periodically visited Australia; she performed three songs, &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot;, &quot;All My Love&quot; and &quot;Telling it like it Is&quot;, for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) in March 1985. Concert excerpts were broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.

In 1985 Geyer signed with WEA Records and in May she released a single &quot;All My Love&quot;, which peaked at number 28. In the following month her eighth studio album, &quot;Sing to Me&quot;, peaked at number 37. It was not given a US release and none of the follow-up singles reached the top 50—Geyer and WEA parted ways. She recorded a live album &quot;Live at the Basement&quot; in May 1986, which was released later that year by ABC Records.

Geyer continued as an in-demand US session vocalist, as in Australia. In 1986 she sang lead vocals on the Danny Hutton Hitters cover of Nik Kewshaw&#x27;s &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot; that was featured in the John Hughes 1986 film Pretty In Pink, She appeared on Sting&#x27;s 1987 double-album, &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot;, including his single &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;. She performed a duet with Joe Cocker on his 1987 album &quot;Unchain My Heart&quot; and, following its release, toured Europe with him as a backing vocalist. She was audible on Toni Childs&#x27; hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; from that artist&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Union&quot;. Other sessions included working with Neil Diamond, Julio Iglesias, Buddy Guy and Bonnie Raitt. She also recorded &quot;Is it Hot in Here&quot; for the soundtrack of the 1988 film &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;. She described her backing vocals as supplying &quot;The old Alabama black man wailing on the end of a record so they hire the white Jewish girl from Australia to do it.&quot;

In 1988 Geyer joined the group Easy Pieces, with Hamish Stuart (guitar and vocals) and Steve Ferrone (drums) both ex-the Average White Band and Anthony Jackson (bass guitar). They signed to A&amp;M Records and their self-titled album, &quot;Easy Pieces&quot;, was released in 1988 to positive reviews, but the label changed distributors just as it was released and music stores could not order copies. The album did not chart.

===1992–1999: &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, &quot;Difficult Woman&quot;, &quot;The Best of Renee Geyer&quot; and &quot;Sweet Life&quot;===


Geyer visited Australia in 1992 and recorded a number of songs, including &quot;Foggy Highway&quot;, for the ABC-TV mini series &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, alongside Vika Bull, Deborah Conway and Paul Kelly. The soundtrack album was released in February 1993 and peaked at number 71 on the ARIA Charts. Two singles were released from the soundtrack including Geyer&#x27;s cover of Jean Stafford&#x27;s &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll Take Home The Roses&quot;. Kelly also produced Geyer&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Difficult Woman&quot; which was released on Larrikin Records in 1994. It was her first solo studio album in 9 years. The exposure encouraged Geyer to move back to Australia and re-established herself on the live circuit. Her performances showed a more relaxed stage persona than at her peak when her innate shyness was often cleverly disguised. Now a confident, mature woman she showed off a hitherto hidden wicked sense of humour.

In May 1998 Mushroom Records released &quot;The Best of Renee Geyer 1973-1998&quot;, which peaked at number 50 in New Zealand and 53 in Australia. Early pressings were released with a bonus disc, &quot;Renéemixed&quot;, containing remixed tracks including her 1981 single &quot;Say I Love You&quot;, which was issued as the lead single by Groove 21/20 featuring Geyer. Also in 1998 Geyer recorded &quot;Yil Lull&quot; alongside Kelly, Archie Roach, Christine Anu, Judith Durham, Kutcha Edwards and Tiddas. In March 1999 Geyer released her tenth studio album &quot;Sweet Life&quot;, which was co-produced by Kelly with Joe Camilleri (Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons, The Black Sorrows). The album peaked at number 50 in the ARIA Charts.

===2000–2008: ARIA Hall of Fame, &quot;Tenderland&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Dedicated&quot;===

In April 2000 Geyer released her autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Difficult Woman: The Renée Geyer Story&quot;, referencing her 1994 studio album, &quot;Difficult Woman&quot;. It was co-written with Australian music journalist Ed Nimmervoll. According to ABC Radio Melbourne&#x27;s reviewer Sian Prior it has &quot;plenty of talk about sex and drugs and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll... [but] you get a sense of a quite vulnerable person under the confident stage persona... [and it is] written in a nice conversational style, easy to read, and structured not chronologically as you might expect, but in themed chapters.&quot;

In October 2000 Geyer performed at the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Paralympics in Sydney. In August 2003 the singer released her eleventh studio album &quot;Tenderland&quot;. It peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Charts, equalling her highest-charting album in her career.
&quot;Live at the Athenaeum&quot; was released in April 2004 and Geyer&#x27;s twelfth studio album &quot;Tonight&quot; in April 2005.

Geyer was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 14 July 2005 by her former label boss Gudinski. At the ceremony, contemporary R&amp;B singer Jade MacRae performed a Geyer medley, followed by Geyer singing her 1975 hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;. During July 2007 Geyer undertook the role of stepmother in musical theatre play &quot;Sleeping Beauty: This is Not a Lullaby&quot; at the Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne. In 2008 she provided a voice in the claymation film &quot;Mary &amp; Max&quot; by Adam Elliot.

Geyer and fellow 1970s singer, Marcia Hines, are the subjects of Australian academic, Jon Stratton&#x27;s 2008 cultural studies article, &quot;A Jew Singing Like a Black Woman in Australia: Race, Renée Geyer and Marcia Hines&quot;. Geyer delivered a two-hour master class on 3 December 2008 to illustrate her annoyance at vocal gymnastics used by singers Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera which had influenced contestants on talent quests such as &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. Geyer was approached to be a judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot; but declined; she criticised judges on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;: Hines for being &quot;so neutral, I don&#x27;t hear an opinion&quot; and Kyle Sandilands for his hurtful commentary rather than constructive criticisms.

===2009–2023: &quot;Renéessance&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; and &quot;Swing&quot;===
After signing with Liberation Blue Records, which was owned by Gudinski, Geyer released another album, &quot;Renéessance&quot; in May 2009. It is a collection of newly recorded acoustic versions of previously recorded tracks. In June of that year, Geyer was diagnosed with breast cancer and following surgery was told it had been detected early and a full recovery was expected.

In March 2010 Warner Music Australia released another compilation album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which is her highest-charting album in New Zealand—peaking at number 21. In August 2011 she was fined for careless driving over two incidents in Victoria in 2010 and 2011, where she crashed into parked cars, a tree and a shop front. Her lawyer had blamed the crashes on a drug she was taking to treat breast cancer which he said led to a loss of concentration. She was fined $500, which was ordered to be paid to the Cancer Council.

In April 2013 Geyer released her fifteenth and last studio album &quot;Swing&quot;, which consists of big-band cover versions. It peaked at number 22 in Australia. Geyer toured the album across 2013. In November 2013 the singer was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.

In 2015, Geyer allegedly verbally attacked a receptionist at the Adina Hotel in Haymarket, leaving the receptionist in tears after telling Geyer that she needed to provide vehicle registration to access the car park. In January 2017, Geyer was not convicted but was handed a 12-month good behaviour bond. In October 2018 proposed recording a new album, &quot;I am playing it by ear, but sometime in the next year, I would like to do something—another new album. I have collaborated with people on different things and other projects, but I would like to do something of my own again. And I think in the next twelve months it will happen. And it probably might be my last one. I will probably do something, like a tribute to a blues situation, because I have been so influenced by the blues through my life, and I have never really spoken to that. So, I might do something, that has to do with that. Some version of a blues record.&quot;

In January 2023 Geyer was admitted to a Geelong hospital for hip surgery. It was discovered that she had inoperable lung cancer. Renée Geyer died at that hospital from surgical complications on 17 January 2023 at the age of 69. A public memorial in her honour was held in April 2023 in St. Kilda, performers included Kevin Borich, Kate Ceberano, Deborah Conway, Paul Kelly and Russell Morris. Renee was a resident of St Kilda and lived in a number of rental properties around the area over the years, always identifying as &quot;a Melbourne person at heart&quot;.

<text>Michiel Coxie the Elder, Michiel Coxcie the Elder or Michiel van Coxcie, Latinised name &quot;Coxius&quot; (1499 – 3 March 1592), was a Flemish painter of altarpieces and portraits, a draughtsman and a designer of stained-glass windows, tapestries and prints. He worked for patrons in the principal cities of Flanders. He became the court painter to successively Emperor Charles V and King Philip II of Spain.

Highly respected by his contemporaries, Coxie was given the nickname &quot;the Flemish Raphael&quot; as some of his contemporaries regarded him as being on an equal level as the Italian master. This also reflected his contemporaries&#x27; appreciation that his study of classical Antiquity and the art of Renaissance masters like Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci during his 10-year residence in Italy had left an important mark on his style. His innovative style and bold compositions were in the centuries after his death an inspiration to Flemish artists including Peter Paul Rubens. He was thus an important artistic link between the artists of early Netherlandish painting and the Flemish Baroque. Coxie was also a copyist and produced a well-known copy of the Ghent Altarpiece by the van Eyck brothers as well as a &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden.

== Life ==
===Early life and training===
No records survive about the early life and training of Michiel Coxie. His year of birth has been determined to be 1499 through deduction from later sources. The place of his birth also remains uncertain. It is generally assumed that he was born in Mechelen as this was the first place he appears to have returned to after his long-term residence in Italy. Some art historians have suggested that his place of birth was in the region around Hasselt, then in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.
The master or masters from whom he received his artistic training are not documented. Most known facts and statements of later biographers point to a training in the workshop of the Brussels master Bernard van Orley. It is known that during his stay in Rome, Coxie enjoyed the favor of the Flemish Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt who may have been Bernard van Orley&#x27;s patron in Rome assuming van Orley really took the trip to Rome as some sources have suggested. It has been speculated that this relationship with the Cardinal proves that van Orley recommended his pupil to his former patron. Michiel Coxie was also asked to complete the commission for the stained glass windows of the Brussels cathedral of St Michael and St Gudula after Bernard van Orley died in 1541. The early Flemish artist biographer Karel van Mander states in his Schilderboeck of 1604 that Coxie trained with a &quot;Bernard van Brussel&quot; (Bernard from Brussels). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that Coxie was a pupil of Bernard van Orley. Even so, due to the lack of contemporary documentary evidence and surviving youth works by Coxie it is not possible to confirm with certainty that Bernard van Orly was Coxie&#x27;s master.

===Foreign travel===
The earliest documents attesting to Michiel Coxie&#x27;s life and activities date to the period of his residence in Rome. The Florentine artist and artist&#x27;s biographer Giorgio Vasari knew Coxie personally. He recounts that Coxie was commissioned by Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt to paint frescoes in the Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima. Work on the frescoes likely commenced around 1531. As the fresco technique is a painting technique typical of the Italian Renaissance and virtually unknown in contemporary Flemish painting, it must be assumed that by the time Coxie started work on the frescos he had already resided in Italy for a period of time so as to familiarise himself with this technique. It is therefore believed he may have arrived in Italy around 1527 after the sack of Rome by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. It appears that the frescoes in the Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima earned him a reputation in Rome. Not long after completing the frescoes in 1534 he was admitted to the Compagnia di San Luca, Rome&#x27;s guild of painters and miniaturists. He was one of the first Flemish artists to be inducted into the guild.

Coxie stayed in Italy until the end of the 1530s executing many commissions. He was involved in the decoration of the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica but the frescoes that he created are lost due to later renovations to the interior of the church. During his stay in Italy he also provided designs for Italian engravers including for the series of 32 prints on the history of Amor and Psyche which was engraved by Agostino Veneziano and the Master of the Die and published by Antonio Salamanca in Rome between 1530 and 1560.
===Return to Flanders===
Coxie travelled in 1539 back to his home country via Milan. While in Milan he made two designs for tapestries. He first settled in Mechelen where he registered in the local Guild of Saint Luke on 11 November 1539. He lived in Mechelen in a house on the Bruul, in the city centre. He married Ida van Hasselt, a native of the city of Hasselt, then in the County of Loon in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. He later resided in Liège, the principal city in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Liège was at that time an important artistic centre where important artists such as Lambert Lombard, Frans Floris and Willem Key were active. Lombard and Floris were Romanists, i.e. artists from the Low Countries who had travelled to Rome where they had assimilated the new Renaissance currents which they translated upon their return home into a break with the Netherlandish painting traditions. It is not entirely clear how long he stayed in Liège. It may be that for a while he travelled between Mechelen and Liège. The first children of Coxie, a son Raphael and a daughter Anna, may have been born in Liège although other sources place their births in Mechelen. Raphael followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a successful painter. Another son called Willem was born in Mechelen in 1545 or 1546. Willem also became a painter but no existing works by him are known.
Upon his return to the Low Countries Coxie became a sought-after artist who gained many commissions. The first important one was the 1540 commission for &quot;The Holy Kinship&quot; (now in Stift Kremsmünster, Kremsmünster, Austria). This work, probably commissioned by the Antwerp Hosemakers Guild for their altar in the Antwerp Cathedral, is a monumental triptych showing at the centre the Virgin Mary with her mother Anna, Christ and John the Baptist. The scene is set in an overwhelming Renaissance architecture with many figures. With this work Coxie offered the general public in Flanders its first confrontation with the monumental, grand style of the High Renaissance.

When Bernard van Orley died in 1541, while he was working on the designs for stained glass windows for the chapel of the Habsburg rulers in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels, Coxie took over the commission and delivered four designs. Afterwards he was commissioned to design a cycle of stained glass for the St Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral in Ghent. It is believed that around this time he succeeded van Orley as the court painter to Mary of Hungary, sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the governor of the Netherlands. Coxie also contributed to the new Habsburg castle in Binche, construction of which started in 1546. The architect was Jacques du Broeucq from Mons who had also lived and studied in Italy. Coxcie realized fresco paintings in the new castle. He also received the commission to paint a retabel for the rood screen of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. In 1543 Coxie was registered as a poorter (citizen) of the city of Brussels and as a member of the local Guild of Saint Luke. Brussels was at the time the administrative capital of the Low Countries where the court of Mary of Hungary was established. He operated a large workshop in Brussels. His financial success was such that by 1550 he owned two houses in Brussels. He became gradually sought after as a designer of cartoons for tapestries, first by the Habsburg rulers but later also by the local industry. This is not surprising because at that time Brussels was the world center for the production of tapestries, then an important economic factor in the entire Netherlands. He was given the title of cartoon painter of the city of Brussels for which he received an annual salary. Several of Coxcie&#x27;s tapestry designs have been documented, but none have survived. Some cartoons and series of tapestries have been attributed to him, based on stylistic rather than archival grounds. He participated in the &#x27;Jagiellonian tapestries&#x27; which were sold to Sigismund II Augustus for his castle on the Wawel. He created the designs for some biblical scenes including scenes from the &quot;Story of the First Parents&quot;, the &quot;Story of Noah&quot; and the &quot;Story of the Tower of Babel&quot;. Coxie may also have designed the tapestries for Phillip II&#x27;s Royal Palace of Madrid depicting episodes of the life of Cyrus II, based on the writing of Herodotus.
Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, then the ruler over the Low Countries, commissioned many works from Coxie. Coxie also gained commissions from many other prominent persons such as the Morillon family for whom he painted the &quot;Triptych with the triumph of Christ&quot; (M – Museum Leuven). Guy Morillon, originally from Burgundy, was one of the most prominent notables of Leuven and a secretary to king Charles V. Coxie further designed the decorations for the joyous entry of then crown prince Philip II in Brussels in 1549 and a series of portraits of the Habsburg rulers. When in 1555 king Charles V stepped down from the throne in favor of his son Philip II, the new ruler maintained the royal support for Coxie. Philip tasked Coxie with making a true-to-life copy of the &quot;Ghent Altarpiece&quot; by the van Eyck brothers. As the altarpiece was located in the St Bavo&#x27;s Cathedral in Ghent, Coxie temporarily moved to Ghent to execute this commission. He resided there from 1557 to 1559. After completing his copy in 1559, he moved to Mechelen where he acquired a house on the Bruul by swopping it for one of his Brussels homes. He continued to live in this city and became a member of the local chamber of rhetoric de Peoene and the guild of musketeers. At the time Mechelen had gained importance as a religious centre in Flanders because of the founding in 1559 of the Archbischopric of Mechelen, which from 1561 was led by the powerful cardinal Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle who was also the king&#x27;s chancellor. Philip II of Spain commissioned two copies of Van der Weyden&#x27;s &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; from Coxie.
 Also for King Philip, Coxcie painted St. Cecilia at the Virginal (1569). Now in the Prado, this is one of several related paintings of Cecilia by Coxcie and/or his workshop, showing the saint performing identifiable music by Coxcie&#x27;s Flemish contemporaries Jacobus Clemens non Papa and Thomas Crecquillon.

When in 1566 the Beeldenstorm caused the destruction of many religious objects he is said to have attempted to defend Mechelen against the iconoclasts. This shows that he was at heart a devout Catholic and a loyalist of the Habsburg court. This attitude earned him the strong support of the king as well as the protection of the Duke of Alba, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands between 1567 and 1573. The Beeldenstorm caused the loss of a large portion of Coxcie&#x27;s existing works. This era of religious turmoil saw the painter facing many other setbacks. His son Willem who had travelled to Rome in 1567 to study art was arrested in Italy on suspicion of heresy as he had travelled with a group of Dutch and German Protestants. He was convicted to the galleys for 10 years. After the king&#x27;s chancellor de Granvelle, who was then living in Rome, interceded personally with the Pope the sentence was cut in half. A few years later king Philip II himself intervened leading to the liberation of Willem. This illustrates the extent of the support by powerful figures which the artist enjoyed at that time. Even the Duke of Alva bestowed favors on him and his family when he granted Michiel and his son Raphael dispensation from the compulsory billeting of Spanish soldiers at their homes.

His wife died in 1569. Two months after her death he married Jeanne van Schelle (or van Schellen or van Schallen), with whom he had two more children of whom Michiel the Younger became a painter. The painter&#x27;s whereabouts from the 1570s are not entirely clear. In October 1572 Spanish troops plundered Mechelen for three days after retaking the city from an army under the command of William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch Revolt. The event known as the Spanish Fury caused many local painters to flee to Antwerp. Coxie was outside of the country, possibly in Spain, when the events happened. His house was plundered and some painters from Antwerp were able to buy back some tapestry designs which Spanish soldiers had looted from his home.
Upon his return to Flanders, Coxie stayed in Mechelen and took on two pupils in his workshop. However, Mechelen had become a cultural wasteland while Antwerp offered attractive opportunities as many of the altarpieces which had been destroyed needed to be replaced and its leading history painters Frans Floris and Willem Key had just died. He completed an altarpiece in Antwerp in 1575 and was registered in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in 1578. He remained in Antwerp during the period from 1580 to 1585 when the city was governed by a Calvinist government. He was even able as a Catholic to obtain commissions from the local government, which was tolerant of Catholics. In 1585 he was registered as a tenant in the Kloosterstraat in Antwerp, while his house in Mechelen was rented out. After the Fall of Antwerp and the return of Spanish Catholic control over the city in 1585, Coxie immediately gained commissions from patrons in Mechelen, including the city government. The continued appreciation of the Spanish king for the elderly artist was demonstrated when in 1589, he granted him an annuity. Coxie continued painting even when he was over 90 years old.. His last work, dated 1592, was the &quot;Triptych of the Legend of Santa Gudula&quot;, today in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels. This contains on the back of one of the side panels the only known portrait of Philip II painted by the artist. Shortly thereafter, he died after accidentally falling off a scaffold while working on the restoration of the &quot;Judgment of Solomon&quot; in the Antwerp City Hall that he had made nine years earlier for the Antwerp City Council.

==Work==
===General===
Coxie was a prolific artist, who painted altarpieces and portraits and produced designs for stained-glass windows, tapestries and prints. He was skilled in the traditional Flemish oil on panel technique as well as the Italian fresco technique. His career spanned almost the entire 16th century. He operated a large workshop which ensured a large output which contributed to his lifetime reputation and influence. After his death his work soon fell into oblivion as it was overtaken quickly by the triumphant Baroque style introduced into Flanders by Rubens, another Flemish artist who had studied and worked for an extended time in Italy.
His style is a unique synthesis of the Flemish and Italian artistic traditions. His presumed master Bernard van Orley had possibly never studied in Italy but had certainly familiarised himself with the new pictorial vocabulary of the Italian Renaissance through his study of the designs of Raphael. These designs had been brought to Brussels. He had responded to Raphael&#x27;s work by making the figures in his altarpieces more monumental and heroic. He also included classical architecture in his compositions. During his stay in Rome, Coxie was able to directly study the works of Raphael, Michelangelo and other Renaissance painters as well as study the works of Antiquity that were being rediscovered at the time. He also read classical literature and philosophy and was aware of the intellectual discussions on the reception of Antique art in Italy. The panel &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot; which he likely painted during his stay in Rome is an attempt by Coxie to express these visual and philosophical influences. The painting references Plato&#x27;s ideas (the allegory of the cave) expressed in his &quot;The Sofist&quot; about how art imitates nature and sometimes deviates from perfect imitation by changing the proportions in order for the viewer to get a true appreciation of the real object. Coxie deals in &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot; with the question about how art can properly depict reality and what art can tell us about that reality. Only the viewer of the painting can see the way out of the cave, and according to Plato, this search should be the object of all true philosophy. In &quot;Plato&#x27;s Cave&quot; Coxie borrows heavily from Michelangelo&#x27;s models as well as from Antique models. For instance, the Roman Antique statue of &quot;Falling Galatian&quot; (Venice National Archaeological Museum) was the model for the tormented man in the centre.
The first important work he realised upon his return to Flanders after his stay in Italy shows all the key characteristics of his style and the contribution he made to Flemish painting. The triptych of &quot;The Holy Kinship&quot; (now in Stift Kremsmünster, Kremsmünster, Austria) was painted in 1540 for the Antwerp Hosemakers Guild&#x27;s altar in the Antwerp Cathedral. It is a monumental triptych showing at the centre the Virgin Mary with her mother Anna, Christ and John the Baptist. The scene is set in an overwhelming Renaissance architecture with many figures. With this work Coxie showed that he had mastered the Italian style, while not abandoning his roots. The painting has many Italian characteristics. The figure of the Virgin, for instance, goes back directly to Da Vinci. The architectural columns, drapes and niches were inspired by Raphael. Flemish elements in the work are the attention to detail and the rich colour which evoke the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden.

===Prints===
Like many artists of his time, Coxie provided designs for the printers and engravers. An important graphic series by Coxi recounts the story of &quot;Amor and Psyche&quot;. The series was attributed for a long time to Raphael, which testifies to Coxcie&#x27;s excellence as a draughtsman. The Italian artist biographer Giorgio Vasari who knew Coxie personally recounts that Coxie made the design sketches. Another series of prints designed by Coxie tells the stories of &quot;The loves of Jupiter&quot;. He based his designs for both series on stories and art works from Antiquity as well as on works by Raphael and Michelangelo.

<text>Henry Paul Guinness Channon, Baron Kelvedon, (9 October 1935 – 27 January 2007) was Conservative MP for Southend West for 38 years, from 1959 until 1997. He served in various ministerial offices, and was a Cabinet minister for 3½ years, as President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry from January 1986 to June 1987, and then as Secretary of State for Transport to July 1989.

==Early life==
Channon was the only child of Sir Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon, the politician and diarist, and Lady Honor Channon, eldest daughter of Rupert Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh. His family were well connected: his father&#x27;s dearest friend was Prince Paul of Yugoslavia; he received a toy panda from King Edward VIII in the run up to the abdication; and he was friends with the Duke of Kent, who was born on the same day, from childhood. He was evacuated to live with the Astor family during the Second World War.

==Education==
Channon was educated at two private schools: at Lockers Park School in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire and Eton College in Eton, Berkshire. Playwright Terence Rattigan, an intimate companion of his father, dedicated his play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (1946) to him.

Channon completed his national service in the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues) from 1955 to 1956, serving in Cyprus during the 1956 Cyprus emergency. In London, he was a member of the set around Princess Margaret, and then attended Christ Church, Oxford, from 1956. He was president of the Oxford University Conservative Association.

==Early parliamentary career==
While still a second-year undergraduate at Oxford, Channon was elected at the by-election for Southend West in January 1959 at the age of 23. The seat had connections with his family since 1912, when his grandfather, Rupert Guinness, became MP for South East Essex. Guinness became MP for the new seat of Southend in 1918. When Guinness succeeded his father as 2nd Earl of Iveagh in 1927, the seat was won by his wife, Gwendolen Guinness, Countess of Iveagh, who remained MP for Southend until she retired in 1935. She, in turn, was replaced by her son-in-law, Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon, who kept the seat until it was divided in 1950, and who then represented one of the seats that replaced it, Southend West, until his death in October 1958.

Channon won the nomination to his father&#x27;s seat ahead of 129 other applicants and in spite of a campaign in Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; against the apparent nepotism. His grandmother, Lady Iveagh, the former MP, congratulated the voters of Southend for &quot;backing a colt when you know the stable he was trained in&quot;.

He left university to sit in Parliament, and remained the youngest MP until Teddy Taylor was elected in 1964 (Taylor was later MP for the neighbouring constituency of Southend East).

===In government===
Channon was parliamentary private secretary to Richard Wood, (later Lord Holderness), the Minister of Power, from 1959 to 1960, and then to R. A. Butler from 1961 to 1964 (while Butler was Home Secretary, First Secretary of State and then Foreign Secretary). Channon&#x27;s father had once held the same position. Channon was elected to the executive of the 1922 Committee in 1965. He was one of few Conservative MPs to support the 1965 bill that ended capital punishment, and also opposed the unilateral declaration of independence by Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesia.

In opposition, Conservative leader Edward Heath appointed Channon as a spokesman on public building and works in 1965, and then on arts in 1967. He served as a junior minister in the government led by Heath from 1970 to 1974, as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1970, then as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the new Department of the Environment from 1970 to 1972, briefly as Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office for six months in 1972, and then Minister of Housing and Construction from 1972 to 1974. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw met IRA leader Sean MacStiofain and other Republicans at Channon&#x27;s house in Chelsea on 7 July 1972. The talks ended in failure, and the IRA bombed Belfast repeatedly on Bloody Friday just two weeks later. Following the February 1974 general election, Channon joined Heath&#x27;s shadow cabinet as environment spokesman. His services were dispensed with by Margaret Thatcher when she became leader of the Conservative Party in February 1975.

Channon joined the Conservative delegation to the Council of Europe and Western European Union in 1976, and considered standing in the first UK elections to the European Parliament in 1979, but failed to win the nomination for the North-East Essex seat.

He became Minister of State at the Civil Service Department when the Conservatives returned to power in 1979, and joined the Privy Council in 1980. After the department was abolished in 1981, he became Minister of the Arts. The call from 10 Downing Street came while he was swimming in the sea near his villa on the island of Mustique. He became Minister of State for Trade at the Department of Trade and Industry following the 1983 general election. He took charge of the department for two short periods, after Cecil Parkinson resigned following the Sara Keays affair in 1983, and while his successor, Norman Tebbit, recovered from his injuries sustained in the Brighton bombing in 1984. Channon became President of the Board of Trade and Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 24 January 1986, after Leon Brittan resigned following the Westland affair.

Channon&#x27;s time as Trade and Industry Secretary was marred in several ways. A major issue of the day was a takeover by the Guinness group using an inflated stock value via third parties – the Guinness share-trading fraud during its takeover of Distillers. As a member of the Guinness family, Channon had to stand aside from any investigation into the affair as he would have been accused of a conflict of interest. In addition, proposed sales of troubled nationalised carmarkers British Leyland to General Motors and of Austin Rover to Ford also fell through. Leyland Trucks was later sold to DAF. He blocked a proposed merger of Tate and Lyle with British Sugar and a takeover bid for Plessey by GEC. Channon was later alleged to have been involved in the government&#x27;s secret supply of weapons of mass destruction to Iraq.

===Transport Secretary===
Channon was appointed Secretary of State for Transport on 13 June 1987. His tenure as Transport Secretary was blighted by several major transport disasters: 31 died in the King&#x27;s Cross fire on 18 November 1987; 35 were killed when three trains crashed near Britain&#x27;s busiest railway station in the Clapham Junction rail crash on 12 December 1988; 270 died when Pan Am Flight 103 was brought down by a bomb over Scottish town of Lockerbie in the Lockerbie Disaster on 21 December 1988; and 44 died when a British Midland plane crashed beside the M1 motorway in the Kegworth air disaster on 8 January 1989. He was roughly treated in the House of Commons by Labour&#x27;s transport spokesman, John Prescott, who pilloried him for underinvestment in the rail network, and for taking a family holiday to Mustique shortly after the Lockerbie disaster.

A coincidence led to Channon&#x27;s sacking in July 1989 as Transport Secretary. British investigative journalist, Paul Foot, in a 1994 article for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, described what happened: The American investigative columnist, Jack Anderson, has had some scoops in his time but none more significant than his revelation – in January 1990 – that in mid-March 1989, three months after Lockerbie, George Bush rang Margaret Thatcher to warn her to &#x27;cool it&#x27; on the subject. On what seems to have been the very same day [in March 1989], perhaps a few hours earlier, Thatcher&#x27;s Secretary of State for Transport, Paul Channon, was the guest of five prominent political correspondents at a lunch at the Garrick Club. It was agreed that anything said at the lunch was &#x27;on strict lobby terms&#x27; – that is, for the journalists only, not their readers. Channon then announced that the Dumfries and Galloway Police – the smallest police force in Britain – had concluded a criminal investigation into the Lockerbie crash. They had found who was responsible and arrests were expected before long. So sensational was the revelation that at least one of the five journalists broke ranks; and the news that the Lockerbie villains would soon be behind bars in Scotland was divulged to the public. Channon promptly said that he was not the source of the story. Denounced in a front page story in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as a &quot;liar&quot;, he did not sue or complain. A few months later he was quietly sacked. Thatcher could not blame her loyal minister for his indiscretion, which coincided with her instructions from the White House.

Channon was replaced by Cecil Parkinson on 24 July 1989.

===Backbenches and retirement===
Channon harboured hopes of becoming the fourth member of his family to become Speaker of the House of Commons, but he withdrew from the election to replace Bernard Weatherill in 1992. He later served as chairman of the House of Commons Finance and Services Committee and chairman of the Transport Select Committee.

He retired from Parliament at the 1997 general election and was created a life peer as Baron Kelvedon, of Ongar in the County of Essex, on 11 June 1997, named after the family&#x27;s house at Kelvedon Hall.

Outside politics, he was a member of the board of directors of Guinness, and served with the Guinness Trust.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Channon married Ingrid Guinness (née Wyndham), the former wife of his cousin Jonathan Guinness. He inherited three stepchildren, and they had three children: Henry, Georgia, and Olivia Gwendolen. In 1986, 22-year-old Olivia died from the effects of drink and drugs during a party in the Christ Church, Oxford, rooms of Count Gottfried von Bismarck. The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure. Henry Channon died on 24 October 2021, aged 51.

==Death==
In later years, Channon suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died at his home in Brentwood, Essex, on 27 January 2007, at the age of 71.

<text>This is the list of members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom in the 1989 to 1994 session. Note that during the session, the parliamentary groups to which both major British parties belonged underwent changes. On 1 May 1992, the European Democrats group, consisting mostly of members of the Conservative Party, dissolved and its members were accorded &#x27;associate party&#x27; status by the EPP group. On 21 April 1993, the Socialist Group, which included members of the Labour Party, was renamed the Party of European Socialists group.

<text>ROUTE 66 Geographic Information Systems B.V. is a privately held company headquartered in Pfäffikon, Switzerland. ROUTE 66 was founded in 1992 and specializes in navigation software and hardware products.

In 1999 the company opened a software development center in Brașov, Romania. In 2005 the company moved all its research and development operations to the aforementioned location, which at that date employed 45 of the company&#x27;s total of 65 employees. In 2008, the company announced 2.4 million euros in revenue. In 2010, the company had 92 employees, of which 65 were software developers. In November 2013, ROUTE 66 launched their latest app Navigate 6.

The Nokia 6110 Navigator delivered with ROUTE 66 was the first mobile phone with on-board navigation installed as standard, apart from smartphones with their significantly larger dimensions and heavier weight. 

The relationship between Route66, General Magic and Magic Lane is further highlighted by their shared history. The current founder of Magic Lane previously developed the Route66 route planner in the 1990s, which was among the first navigation solutions for platforms like Mac, PC, and early mobile phones. With over 30 years of experience in the maps, location, and navigation industry, they established General Magic to rebuild their software from scratch, focusing on privacy, off line functionality, light weight hardware usage and multi SDK support. Their end user product is Magic Earth. Magic Earth serves as a testing ground for their developments on Android and iOS platforms.

Today, Magic Lane provides the technological foundation and SDK for businesses, while Magic Earth serves as the consumer-facing application, both stemming from the expertise and innovations of their shared founders. The IP of former Route66 and General Magic is incorporated in Magic Lane to continue the development of location intelligence products and solutions, like navigation SDK&#x27;s.

<text>Ulysses Anthony Ricci (1888–1960) was an American sculptor known primarily for his architectural sculpture. Born in New York City, Ricci was an apprentice at the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Works in New Jersey from 1902 to 1906. He studied at Cooper Union Institute and at the Art Students League with James Earle Fraser and George Bridgman. He opened his own studio in 1914 and was a partner in the firm Ricci &amp; Zari from 1917 to 1941.

Ricci came to the attention of Karl Bitter when Bitter was head of sculpture decoration at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition which opened in 1915, where Ricci was commissioned to execute some of the sculptural decorations.

Architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci apprenticed with Ricci &amp; Zari.

<text>Francesco Lazzaro Guardi (; 5 October 1712 – 1 January 1793) was an Italian painter, nobleman, and a member of the Venetian School. He is considered to be among the last practitioners, along with his brothers, of the classic Venetian school of painting.

In the early part of his career he collaborated with his older brother Gian Antonio in the production of religious paintings. After Gian Antonio&#x27;s death in 1760, Francesco concentrated on &quot;vedute&quot;. The earliest of these show the influence of Canaletto, but he gradually adopted a looser style characterized by spirited brush-strokes and freely imagined architecture.

==Biography==
Francesco Guardi was born in Venice into a family of nobility from Trentino. His father Domenico (born in 1678) and his brothers Niccolò and Gian Antonio were also painters, later inheriting the family workshop after the father&#x27;s death in 1716. They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.

In 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d&#x27;Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a &quot;Saint Adoring the Eucharist&quot; (c. 1739).
His works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedute show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764.

In 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a &quot;Miracle of a Dominican Saint&quot; clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi-expressionistic style.

Francesco Guardi&#x27;s most important later works include the &quot;Doge&#x27;s Feasts&quot;, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto&#x27;s influence on his art diminished, as shown by the &quot;Piazzetta&quot; in the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe &quot;Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul&quot; in the parish church of Roncegno.

In 1782, Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Grand Dukes to the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI. On September 12 of that year, he was admitted to the Fine Art Academy of Venice.

A stronger attention to colours is present in late works such as the &quot;Concerto of 80 Orphans&quot; of 1782, now in Munich, and in the &quot;Façade of Palace with Staircase&quot; in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo.

Guardi died at Campiello de la Madona in Cannaregio (Venice) in 1793.

==Mature style==
Among all the paintings attributed to either Francesco and his brother Gian Antonio Guardi, the most praised work is not a landscape, but instead the airy sfumato &quot;Story of Tobit&quot; painted for the organ loft in the small Chiesa dell&#x27;Angelo San Raffaele. To quote from the Web Gallery of Art:
Perspective, organized aerial space, the Palladian solidity of Tiepolo... are exchanged for a personal style of coloured handwriting – now brilliantly calligraphic, and now brilliantly cloudy.

Guardi&#x27;s painterly style is known as &quot;pittura di tocco&quot; (of touch) for its small dotting and spirited brush-strokes. This looser style of painting had been used by Giovanni Piazzetta and Sebastiano Ricci, and recalls, in some religious themes, the sweetened sfumato of Barocci&#x27;s Bolognese style. In this he differs from the more linear and architecturally accurate style of Canaletto&#x27;s painting. This style, a century later, would make Guardi&#x27;s works highly prized by the French Impressionists.

Canaletto, as a vedutista, concentrated on glamorous urban architecture erected by the Serene Republic; on the other hand, in Guardi, the buildings often appear to be melting and sinking into a murky lagoon. Canaletto&#x27;s canvases often have intricate linear and brilliant details, and depict Venice in sunny daylight. Guardi paints clouded skies above a city at dusk. These contrasts, however, simplify the facts, since Canaletto often painted the drab communal life and neighborhoods (creating in them some epic artistic qualities), while Guardi did not avoid sometimes painting the ceremonies of Ducal Venice. Ultimately, Guardi&#x27;s paintings evoke the onset of the dissipation. The citizenry has shrunken to an impotent lilliputian crowd of &quot;rubber-neckers&quot;, unable to rescue the crumbling Republic, as for example in the &quot;Fire in the Oil Depot in San Marcuola&quot;. It was fitting depiction of the rapidly declining empire, which had declined, in Napoleon&#x27;s assessment, into a &quot;drawing room of Europe&quot; peopled with casinos, carnivals, and courtesans for hire.

<text>Jacob Leisler ( – May 16, 1691) was a German-born politician and colonial administrator in the Province of New York. He gained wealth in New Amsterdam (later New York City) in the North American fur trade and tobacco business. In what became known as Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, he took control of the city, and ultimately the entire province, from appointees of deposed King James II, in the name of the Protestant accession of William III and Mary II.

Beginning in 1689, Leisler led an insurrection and seized control of the city by taking over Fort James at the lower end of Manhattan. He took over control of the entire province, appointing himself as acting Lieutenant Governor of the Province of New York, which he retained until March 1691, refusing to yield power until the newly appointed governor himself finally arrived. While Leisler claimed to have acted to support the Protestant accession against Jacobite officeholders in New York, he was arrested by the newly appointed governor of New York in March 1691. With opponents active against him, he was condemned and executed in New York City for treason against the Crown. His estate was forfeited to the Crown.

During his period of control, Leisler completed a major purchase of property from Sir John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, to set up a French Huguenot settlement north of Manhattan. This developed as the city of New Rochelle, New York. Leisler&#x27;s son and supporters found the trial and conviction most unjust; it was mounted by his enemies. They worked to clear the names of Leisler and Jacob Milborne (his son-in-law) and for the restoration of their estates to their heirs. They gained an act of Parliament in 1695 to achieve this. Remains of the two men were reinterred with honors at the Dutch Reformed Church in Manhattan.

==Early life==
Leisler was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany (then the Holy Roman Empire), in March 1640, the son of Calvinist French Reformed minister Jacob Victorian Leisler. After his father&#x27;s death in 1651, Leisler was sent to military school.

He went to New Amsterdam (later New York) in 1660 as a soldier in the service of the Dutch West India Company. Leaving the company&#x27;s employ soon after his arrival, Leisler engaged in the lucrative fur trade and tobacco trade and became a wealthy man. New York tax records from 1676 list Leisler as the third wealthiest man in the city.

In 1674, Leisler was one of the administrators of a forced loan imposed by Anthony Colve. While residing in Albany in 1676, Leisler engaged in a theological dispute with the Rev. Nicholas van Rensselaer, who had been appointed to the Reformed pulpit by James, Duke of York (later King King James II). His finances and reputation both suffered from this encounter, as he and fellow dissenter Jacob Milborne were forced to pay all the costs of a lawsuit they had initiated in the dispute. While on a voyage to Europe in 1678, Leisler was captured by Moorish pirates. He was forced to pay a ransom of 2,050 pieces of eight to obtain his freedom.

Leisler had endeared himself to the common people by befriending a family of French Huguenots who had been landed on Manhattan island. They were so destitute that a public tribunal had decided they should be sold into slavery to pay their ship charges. Leisler prevented the sale by purchasing the freedom of the widowed mother and son before the sale could be held. French Huguenots were arriving in New York as refugees from religious persecution by Catholics in France. Under Thomas Dongan&#x27;s administration in 1683, Leisler was appointed one of the judges, or &quot;commissioners,&quot; of the court of admiralty in New York, a justice of the peace for New York City and County, and a militia captain.

==Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion==

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 also played out in New York, where people of a wide variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds divided into two well-defined factions. In general, the small shopkeepers, small farmers, sailors, poor traders and artisans allied against the patroons (landholders), rich fur traders, merchants, lawyers, and crown officers. The former were led by Leisler (although he was a wealthy man), the latter by Peter Schuyler, Nicholas Bayard, Stephen Van Cortlandt, William Nicolls, and other representatives of the elite Hudson Valley families. The Leislerians claimed greater loyalty to the Protestant accession.

In 1688, Governor Dongan was succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor Francis Nicholson. In 1689, the military force of the city of New York consisted of a regiment of five companies, with Leisler as one of the company captains. He was popular with the men and was probably the only wealthy resident in the province who sympathized with the Dutch lower classes, who were agitated by the attempts of the Jacobite officeholders to retain power in spite of the revolution in England and the accession of William III and Mary II to the throne. When news was received that Governor Sir Edmund Andros had been imprisoned in Boston by the opposition, the Leislerians took possession on May 31, 1689, of Fort James at the southern end of Manhattan Island. They renamed it Fort William and announced their determination to hold it until the arrival of a governor who was commissioned by the new sovereigns.

Upon hearing of a report which claimed supporters of King James II were about to seize the fort and massacre settlers of Dutch descent, an armed mob gathered on the evening of June 2, 1689, to overthrow the existing government. The cry of &quot;Leisler&quot; was raised, and the crowd rushed to his house. At first, he refused to lead the movement, but when the demand was reiterated, he acceded and within an hour received the keys of the fort, which had been seized. The revolutionaries took advantage of the fort containing all the public funds, whose return Lieutenant Governor Nicholson demanded in vain.

Four hundred of the new party signed an agreement to hold the fort &quot;for the present Protestant power that reigns in England,&quot; and a committee of safety of ten of the city freeholders assumed the powers of a provisional government of which they declared Jacob Leisler to be the head. They commissioned him as &quot;captain of the fort.&quot; In this capacity, he began to repair the fort, strengthening it with a battery of six guns beyond its walls. This was the origin of the public park known as the Battery in Lower Manhattan. Thus began Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion.

===Leisler as acting lieutenant-governor===
The aristocrats also favored deposing James but preferred to continue the provincial government established by his authority, rather than risk the danger of an interregnum. Nicholson and the council of the province, with the authorities of the city, headed by Mayor Stephen van Cortlandt, attempted to prevent the uprising, but without effect. Finally, becoming alarmed for his own safety, Lieutenant-Governor Nicholson sailed for England on June 24. The New York City mayor and other officials retired to Albany.

Albany held out against Leisler&#x27;s authority for a time. In November, Leisler sent Jacob Milborne to Albany with an armed force to assist in its defense against any Indians. Milborne was directed to withhold aid unless Leisler&#x27;s authority was recognized. That was refused, and Milborne returned unsuccessful. However, after the destruction of Schenectady on February 19, 1690, by the French and their allied Indians, Christian Mohawk among them, Albany submitted to Leisler&#x27;s authority.

Under authority of a letter from the home government addressed to Nicholson &quot;or in his absence, to such as for the time being takes care for preserving the peace and administering the laws in His Majesty&#x27;s province of New York,&quot; Leisler had assumed the title of lieutenant-governor in December 1689. He dissolved the committee of safety, appointed a council, and took charge of the government of the entire province. He appointed Jacob Milborne as Clerk to the Council, Attorney-General, Advocate General and his Secretary. Milborne married Leisler&#x27;s daughter Mary.

Leisler summoned the first Intercolonial Congress in America, which met in New York on May 1, 1690, to plan concerted action against the French and Native Americans in the ongoing conflict in North America. The congress planned an expedition against Canada. It equipped and dispatched against Quebec the first fleet of men-of-war ever sent from the Port of New York. However, the expedition was unsuccessful.

In the meantime, Colonel Henry Sloughter had been commissioned Governor of the Province of New York by William and Mary on September 3, 1689, but he did not reach New York until March 19, 1691.

===Leisler and Huguenots===
Acting on behalf of a group of Huguenots in New York, Leisler brokered the purchase of land upon which they could settle. In 1689 John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, officially deeded 6,100 acres (25 km²) to Leisler for the establishment of a Huguenot community north of Manhattan. On September 20, 1689, Leisler donated a third of this land to Huguenot refugees. In addition to the purchase money, Leisler and his heirs and assigns were to yield and pay unto John Pell and his heirs and assigns (Lords of the Pelham Manor) one &quot;Fat Calf&quot; yearly, as acknowledgment of their feudal obligation to the Manor. This settlement developed as the city of New Rochelle, New York.

===End of rebellion===

On January 28, 1691, English Army officer Richard Ingoldesby, who had been commissioned lieutenant-governor of the province, landed with two companies of soldiers in Manhattan and demanded possession of Fort James. Leisler refused to surrender the fort without an order from the king or the governor. After some controversy, Ingoldesby attacked the fort on March 17, during which Leisler&#x27;s forces killed two of his soldiers and wounded several.

When Governor Sloughter finally arrived in New York the following March, he immediately demanded Leisler&#x27;s surrender. Leisler refused to surrender the fort until he was convinced of Sloughter&#x27;s identity, and the governor had sworn in his council. As soon as the latter event occurred, he wrote the governor a letter resigning his command.

Sloughter responded by arresting Leisler and nine of his colleagues, including his son-in-law Jacob Milborne. All but Milborne were released after trial. Leisler was imprisoned and charged with treason and murder. Shortly afterward, he was tried and condemned to death. His son-in-law and secretary, Milborne, was condemned on the same charges. Leisler&#x27;s son and other supporters were outraged by the trials, as they were considered unjust. The judges were the personal and political enemies of the prisoners, and their acts were described as &quot;gross.&quot;

Governor Sloughter was said to have hesitated to sign the death warrants but was trying to stabilize politics in the colony and did not have sufficient influence among the elite of New York City. He was said to have finally signed the warrants under the influence of wine.

On May 16, 1691, Leisler and Milborne were executed. Leisler&#x27;s wife&#x27;s nephews, Bayard and Van Cortland, were on the Council that insisted upon his execution. The court had sentenced them to be hanged &quot;by the Neck and being Alive their bodyes be Cutt downe to Earth and Their Bowells to be taken out and they being Alive, burnt before their faces...&quot; As was the common law punishment for treason, their estates were forfeited to the Crown. Leisler&#x27;s son and other supporters appealed for justice from the committee of the Privy Council. It reported that although the trial was in conformity to the forms of law, they recommended the restoration of the estates to their heirs.

==Restitution==

In 1695, by an Act of Parliament, achieved through the efforts of Leisler&#x27;s son and supporters, the names of Jacob Leisler and Milborne were cleared, and Leisler&#x27;s estate was restored to his heirs. Three years later the Earl of Bellomont, who had been one of the most influential supporters of Leisler&#x27;s son, was appointed as governor of New York. Through his influence, the assembly voted an indemnity to Leisler&#x27;s heirs.

==Personal life==

Leisler married Elsie Tymens, the widow of Pieter Cornelisz van der Veen, in 1663. They had three daughters:

* Catharine Leisler, who in 1685 married Robert Walters (d. 1733), mayor of New York City from 1720 to 1725.
* Susannah Leisler, who in 1687 married Michael Vaughton of Staffordshire, a half-brother of John Spragg, the colonial secretary of New York.
* Mary Leisler, who in 1691 married Jacob Milborne (-1691), who was executed with his father-in-law.

Some descendants of Leisler use his surname as a middle name. The most prominent of them was Walther Leisler Kiep, a CDU politician.

==Legacy and honors==
*Governor Bellomont authorized the honorable reburial of Leisler and his son-in-law at the Dutch Reformed Church in New York City.
*In June 1913, a monument to Jacob Leisler was dedicated in New Rochelle, New York, by the Huguenot Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Huguenot Association of New Rochelle, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding and honor his role. Leisler has been described as the &quot;first Governor of Colonial New York to owe his position to the popular suffrage.&quot; 
*In June 1913, William O. Bates published his play, &quot;Jacob Leisler: A Play of Old New York&quot;, about the leader and the dramatic events of his life.
*Leisler was depicted by Nazi German propagandist playwright Curt Langenbeck in his play &quot;Der Hochverräter. Tragisches Schauspiel&quot; (1938) as a hero.

<doc id="854573" wikidata="Q411087" url="?curid=854573" title="Batrachotoxin">
<text>Batrachotoxin (BTX) is an extremely potent cardiotoxic and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of beetles, birds, and frogs. The name is from the Greek word . Structurally-related chemical compounds are often referred to collectively as batrachotoxins. In certain frogs, this alkaloid is present mostly on the skin. Such frogs are among those used for poisoning darts. Batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevents them from closing, resulting in paralysis and death. No antidote is known.

==History==
Batrachotoxin was discovered by Fritz Märki and Bernhard Witkop, at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A. Märki and Witkop separated the potent toxic alkaloids fraction from &quot;Phyllobates bicolor&quot; and determined its chemical properties in 1963. They isolated four major toxic steroidal alkaloids including batrachotoxin, isobatrachotoxin, pseudobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A. Due to the difficulty of handling such a potent toxin and the minuscule amount that could be collected, a comprehensive structure determination involved several difficulties. However, Takashi Tokuyama, who joined the investigation later, converted one of the congener compounds, batrachotoxinin A, to a crystalline derivative and its unique steroidal structure was solved with x-ray diffraction techniques (1968). When the mass spectrum and NMR spectrum of batrachotoxin and the batrachotoxinin A derivatives were compared, it was realized that the two shared the same steroidal structure and that batrachotoxin was batrachotoxinin A with a single extra pyrrole moiety attached. In fact, batrachotoxin was able to be partially hydrolyzed using sodium hydroxide into a material with identical TLC and color reactions as batrachotoxinin A. The structure of batrachotoxin was established in 1969 through chemical recombination of both fragments. Batrachotoxinin A was synthesized by Michio Kurosu, Lawrence R. Marcin, Timothy J. Grinsteiner, and Yoshito Kishi in 1998.

==Toxicity==
According to experiments with rodents, batrachotoxin is one of the most potent alkaloids known: its intravenous in mice is 2–3 μg/kg. Meanwhile, its derivative, batrachotoxinin A, has a much lower toxicity with an of 1000 μg/kg.

The toxin is released through colourless or milky secretions from glands located on the back and behind the ears of frogs from the genus &quot;Phyllobates&quot;. When one of these frogs is agitated, feels threatened or is in pain, the toxin is reflexively released through several canals.

Batrachotoxin activity is temperature-dependent, with a maximum activity at . Its activity is also more rapid at an alkaline pH, which suggests that the unprotonated form may be more active.

=== Neurotoxicity ===
As a neurotoxin, it affects the nervous system. Neurological function depends on depolarization of nerve and muscle fibres due to increased sodium ion permeability of the excitable cell membrane. Lipid-soluble toxins such as batrachotoxin act directly on sodium ion channels involved in action potential generation and by modifying both their ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity. Batrachotoxin irreversibly binds to the Na+ channels which causes a conformational change in the channels that forces the sodium channels to remain open. Batrachotoxin not only keeps voltage-gated sodium channels open but also reduces single-channel conductance. In other words, the toxin binds to the sodium channel and keeps the membrane permeable to sodium ions in an &quot;all or none&quot; manner.

This has a direct effect on the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased permeability (selective and irreversible) of the resting cell membrane to sodium ions, without changing potassium or calcium concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles.

Batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevents them from closing. The neuron can no longer send signals and this results in paralysis. Furthermore, the massive influx of sodium ions produces osmotic alterations in nerves and muscles, which causes structural changes. It has been suggested that there may also be an effect on the central nervous system, although it is not currently known what such an effect may be.

=== Cardiotoxicity ===
Although generally classified as a neurotoxin, batrachotoxin has marked effects on heart muscles and its effects are mediated through sodium channel activation. Heart conduction is impaired resulting in arrhythmias, extrasystoles, ventricular fibrillation and other changes which lead to asystole and cardiac arrest. Batrachotoxin induces a massive release of acetylcholine in nerves and muscles and destruction of synaptic vesicles, as well. Batrachotoxin R is more toxic than related batrachotoxin A.

==Treatment==
Currently, no effective antidote exists for the treatment of batrachotoxin poisoning. Veratridine, aconitine and grayanotoxin—like batrachotoxin—are lipid-soluble poisons which similarly alter the ion selectivity of the sodium channels, suggesting a common site of action. Due to these similarities, treatment for batrachotoxin poisoning might best be modeled after, or based on, treatments for one of these poisons. Treatment may also be modeled after that for digitalis, which produces somewhat similar cardiotoxic effects.

While it is not an antidote, the membrane depolarization can be prevented or reversed by either tetrodotoxin (from puffer fish), which is a noncompetitive inhibitor, or saxitoxin (&quot;red tide&quot;). These both have effects antagonistic to those of batrachotoxin on sodium flux. Certain anesthetics may act as receptor antagonists to the action of this alkaloid poison, while other local anesthetics block its action altogether by acting as competitive antagonists.

==Sources==
Batrachotoxin has been found in four Papuan beetle species, all in the genus &quot;Choresine&quot; in the family Melyridae; &quot;C. pulchra&quot;, &quot;C. semiopaca&quot;, &quot;C. rugiceps&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; sp. A.

Several species of bird endemic to New Guinea have the toxin in their skin and on their feathers: the blue-capped ifrit (&quot;Ifrita kowaldi&quot;), little shrikethrush (aka rufous shrike-thrush, &quot;Colluricincla megarhyncha&quot;), and the following pitohui species: the hooded pitohui (&quot;Pitohui dichrous&quot;, the most toxic of the birds), crested pitohui (&quot;Ornorectes cristatus&quot;), black pitohui (&quot;Melanorectes nigrescens&quot;), rusty pitohui (&quot;Pseudorectes ferrugineus&quot;), and the variable pitohui, which is now split into three species: the northern variable pitohui (&quot;Pitohui kirhocephalus&quot;), Raja Ampat pitohui (&quot;P. cerviniventris&quot;), and southern variable pitohui (&quot;P. uropygialis&quot;).

While the purpose for toxicity in these birds is not certain, the presence of batrachotoxins in these species is an example of convergent evolution. It is believed that these birds gain the toxin from batrachotoxin-containing insects that they eat and then secrete it through the skin.

Batrachotoxin has also been found in all described species of the poison dart frog genus &quot;Phyllobates&quot; from Nicaragua to Colombia, including the golden poison frog (&quot;Phyllobates terribilis&quot;), black-legged poison frog (&quot;P. bicolor&quot;), lovely poison frog (&quot;P. lugubris&quot;), Golfodulcean poison frog (&quot;P. vittatus&quot;), and Kokoe poison frog (&quot;P. aurotaenia&quot;). The Kokoe poison frog used to include &quot;P.&quot; sp. aff. &quot;aurotaenia&quot;, now recognized as distinct. All six of these frog species are in the poison dart frog family.

The frogs do not produce batrachotoxin themselves. Just as in the birds, it is believed that these frogs gain the toxin from batrachotoxin-containing insects that they eat, and then secrete it through the skin. Beetles in the genus &quot;Choresine&quot; are not found in Colombia, but it is thought that the frogs might get the toxin from beetles in other genera within the same family (Melyridae), several of which are found in Colombia.

Frogs raised in captivity do not produce batrachotoxin, and thus may be handled without risk. However, this limits the amount of batrachotoxin available for research as 10,000 frogs yielded only 180 mg of batrachotoxin. As these frogs are endangered, their harvest is unethical. Biosynthetic studies are also challenged by the slow rate of synthesis of batrachotoxin.

The native habitat of poison dart frogs is the warm regions of Central and South America.

==Use==
The most common use of this toxin is by the Noanamá Chocó and Emberá Chocó of the Embera-Wounaan of western Colombia for poisoning blowgun darts for use in hunting.

Poison darts are prepared by the Chocó by first impaling a frog on a piece of wood. By some accounts, the frog is then held over or roasted alive over a fire until it cries in pain. Bubbles of poison form as the frog&#x27;s skin begins to blister. The dart tips are prepared by touching them to the toxin, or the toxin can be caught in a container and allowed to ferment. Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous. Other accounts say that a stick &quot;siurukida&quot; (&quot;bamboo tooth&quot;) is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs. This causes the frog to perspire profusely on its back, which becomes covered with a white froth. The darts are dipped or rolled in the froth, preserving their lethal power for up to a year.

<text>The Sudeten German Party (, SdP, ) was created by Konrad Henlein under the name &quot;Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront&quot; (&quot;Front of the Sudeten German Homeland&quot;) on 1 October 1933, some months after the First Czechoslovak Republic had outlawed the German National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei&quot;, DNSAP). In April 1935, the party was renamed &quot;Sudetendeutsche Partei&quot; following a mandatory demand of the Czechoslovak government. The name was officially changed to Sudeten German and Carpathian German Party (&quot;Sudetendeutsche und Karpatendeutsche Partei&quot;) in November 1935.

With the rising power of Nazi Party in Germany, the Sudeten German Party became a major pro-Nazi force in Czechoslovakia with the explicit official aim of breaking the country up and joining it to the Third Reich. By June 1938, the party had over 1.3 million members, i.e. 40.6% of ethnic-German citizens of Czechoslovakia. During the last free democratic elections before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the May 1938 communal elections, the party gained 88% of ethnic-German votes, taking over control of most municipal authorities in the Czech borderland. The country&#x27;s mass membership made it one of the largest fascist parties in Europe at the time.

==Background==
In 1903, a group of Sudeten Germans living in the Bohemian crown lands of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy created the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP). Influenced by the ideas of pan-Germanism and anti-Slavism, they opposed the Czech National Revival movement advocated by the Young Czech Party. The history of this party is centered on the cities of Eger (German for present-day Cheb) and Aussig (Ústí nad Labem), it originated and gave the impetus for Austrian National Socialism. 

At the end of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up into several nation states. The DAP was renamed German National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party on 5 May 1918 and after the proclamation of Czechoslovakia claimed the right of self-determination in the predominantly German-settled &quot;Sudetenland&quot; and &quot;German Bohemian&quot; territories, demanding affiliation with the newly established Republic of German-Austria. However, the new Czech-dominated government demanded the unity of the Bohemian (or now called Czech) lands, as confirmed by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and considered the Pan-German party offensive and dangerous for the existence of the country. The Czechoslovakian DNSAP led by Hans Knirsch together with the conservative German National Party (&quot;Deutsche Nationalpartei&quot;, DNP) became the main proponent of so-called &quot;negativism&quot;, the general tendency among the Sudeten Germans not to accept the legitimacy of the Czechoslovakian state. Under Knirsch&#x27;s successor Rudolf Jung, the party was increasingly influenced by the rise of the Nazi Party in the German Weimar Republic. In 1933, both the DNSAP and DNP decided to dissolve in order to prevent the imminent ban by the Prague government.

==SHF==
The SHF was founded on 1 October 1933. The party entered into an alliance with the Carpatho-German Party (KdP) in the same year.

==Konrad Henlein==
The newly established SdP did not see itself as a successor of the DNSAP; in fact, SdP leader Konrad Henlein sharply rejected the idea. At first he advocated the concept of the Austrofascist movement according to the ideas of Othmar Spann and would have rather preferred the affiliation with the Federal State of Austria than with Nazi Germany. In his earlier speeches (until 1937), Henlein stressed his distance from German National Socialism, affirming loyalty to the Czechoslovak state and stressing approval of the idea of a cantonal system and individual freedom. He later described his contact to Nazi leaders as merely tactical. In 1935 when Karl Hermann Frank became deputy leader, the SdP gradually adopted the DNSAP tradition and became more radical.

In the parliamentary election of May 1935, the SdP with 1,249,534 (15.2%) of the votes became the strongest of all parties in Czechoslovakia. The party had won about 68% of the German votes, thus surpassing the German Social Democratic Workers Party, the German Christian Social People&#x27;s Party and the Farmers&#x27; League. Meanwhile, the influence exerted by the German Nazi dictatorship became stronger and after 1935 several groups within the party were financed by Germany. In November 1937 Adolf Hitler openly declared – according to the Hossbach Memorandum – his intention to separate the Sudetenland from the Czechoslovak state. The SdP officially coordinated this policy with Nazi leaders in order to integrate the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia into the German Reich.
After the Austrian Henlein first met Hitler on 28 March 1938. His policy was the so-called (Basic Planning) of summer 1938 and later in the interior policy of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1938 the Farmers League joined the SdP, as well as many Christian Social deputies in the Czechoslovak parliament. At a convention in Carlsbad on 24 April the majority of the party advocated the demand of the Sudeten Germans as an autonomous ethnic group, the separation of a self-governing German settlement area and the freedom to decide for annexation to Nazi Germany. At this time the SdP had about 1.35 million members.

==Annexation==
In September 1938 the policy of SdP succeeded in the German annexation of Sudetenland according to the Munich Agreement (see: German occupation of Czechoslovakia). On 1 October Henlein was appointed of the incorporated territories, which became the . After a last convention at Aussig, the organization officially merged into the German Nazi Party at a festive ceremony in Reichenberg (Liberec) on 5 November 1938. However, as many Nazi officials like Reinhard Heydrich were suspicious of the SdP party members, they were not absorbed, but had to apply for admission to the Nazi Party. About 520,000 members were approved, among them Henlein himself who also joined the SS. He was officially appointed in 1939, an office he held until 1945, though largely losing power to Reich Protector Heydrich.

As of October 1938 the SdP/KdP parliamentary club had 52 members from the Chamber of Deputies, and their joint Senate club had 26 members. On 30 October 1938 the parliamentary mandates of 46 deputies and 22 Senators of SdP and KdP were annulled.

The SdP branches in areas that remained in Czechoslovakia after the Sudetenland annexation formed the German People&#x27;s Group in Czecho-Slovakia ().

Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet (20 December 1792 – 30 October 1845) was a French painter and printmaker, more especially of military subjects.
==Life==
Charlet was born in Paris. He was the son of a dragoon in the Republican army, whose death in the ranks left the widow and orphan in very poor circumstances. Madame Charlet, however, a woman of determined spirit and an extreme Bonapartist, managed to give her boy a moderate education at the Lycée Napoléon, and was repaid by his lifelong affection.

His first employment was a minor post in the Paris city administration, where he had to register recruits: he served in the National Guard in 1814, fought bravely at the Barrière de Clichy, and, being thus unacceptable to the Bourbon party, was dismissed from the city administration in 1816. He then, having from a very early age had a propensity for drawing, entered the atelier of the distinguished painter Baron Gros, and soon began issuing the first of those lithographed designs which eventually brought him renown.

His &quot;Grenadier de Waterloo&quot;, 1817, with the motto &quot;The Guard Dies and Does Not Surrender&quot; ()—a famous phrase frequently attributed to Cambronne but which he never uttered, and which cannot, perhaps, be traced farther than to this lithograph by Charlet—was particularly popular. It was only towards 1822, however, that he began to be successful in a professional sense. Lithographs (about 2000 altogether), watercolours, sepia drawings, numerous oil sketches, and a few etchings followed one another rapidly. Later in his life there were also three exhibited oil pictures, the especially admired &quot;Episode in the Campaign of Russia&quot; (1836), the &quot;Passage of the Rhine by Moreau&quot; (1837), and &quot;Wounded Soldiers Halting in a Ravine&quot; (1843).

His military subjects particularly delighted Charlet, and they found an energetic response in the popular heart where they kept alive a feeling of pride and regret for the recent past of the French nation and discontent with the present. These feelings increased upon the artist himself towards the close of his career as Charlet designed many subjects of town life, peasant life, and the ways of children with much wit and whim in his descriptive mottoes. One of the most famous sets is the &quot;Vie civile, politique, et militaire du Caporal Valentin&quot;, 50 lithographs dating from 1838 to 1842. In 1838 his health began to fail owing to an affection of the chest.

Charlet was an uncommonly tall man, with an expressive face, bantering and good natured. His character was full of boyish fun and high spirits, with manly independence and a vein of religious feeling. He was a hearty favourite among his intimates, one of whom was the painter Théodore Géricault.

Charlet married in 1824, and two sons survived him.

==Legacy==
A life of Charlet was published in 1856 by a military friend, De la Combe.

Gros studied under Jacques-Louis David in Paris and began an independent artistic career during the French Revolution. Forced to leave France, Gros moved to Genoa. His portrait of French commander Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Arcole in 1796 brought Gros to public attention and gained the patronage of Napoleon. After traveling with Napoleon&#x27;s army for several years, he returned to Paris in 1799. In addition to producing several large paintings of battles and other events in Napoleon&#x27;s life, Gros was a successful portraitist.

==Early life and training==

Born in Paris, Gros began learning to draw at the age of six from his father, Jean-Antoine Gros, who was a miniature painter, and showed himself to be a gifted artist. His mother, Pierrette-Madeleine-Cécile Durand, was also a painter. Towards the close of 1785, Gros, by his own choice, entered the studio of Jacques-Louis David, which he frequented assiduously, continuing at the same time to follow the classes of the Collège Mazarin.

The death of his father, whose circumstances had been embarrassed by the French Revolution, threw Gros upon his own resources in 1791. He now devoted himself wholly to his profession, and he competed (unsuccessfully) in 1792 for the &quot;grand prix&quot;. Around this time, however, on the recommendation of the École des Beaux Arts, he painted portraits of the members of the National Convention, but as the Revolution developed, Gros left France in 1793 for Italy.

==Genoa and Bonaparte==
Gros supported himself in Genoa as a portraitist. He visited Florence and returned to Genoa, where he met Joséphine de Beauharnais. Following her to Milan, Gros was well received by her husband, Napoleon Bonaparte.

After Gros painted the scene &quot;Bonaparte at the Pont d&#x27;Arcole&quot;, Bonaparte gave him the post of &quot;inspecteur aux revues&quot;, which allowed Gros to follow the army. In 1797, Gros was charged with selecting the spoils for the Louvre.

==Paris==
In 1799, Gros left Genoa and made his way to Paris. In the beginning of 1801, he took up his quarters in the Capucins. His study for the painting of the Battle of Nazareth, now in the Musée d&#x27;Arts de Nantes, gained the prize offered in 1802 by the consuls, but the project was not carried out, owing, it is said, to Napoleon&#x27;s jealousy of Jean-Andoche Junot, the general in the painting. Gros was commissioned to paint &quot;Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa&quot;, which is now in the Louvre. This was followed in 1806 by Gros&#x27;s &quot;Bataille d’Aboukir, 25 Juillet 1799&quot; (Joachim Murat at the Battle of Abukir) now at Versailles; and in 1808 by his &quot;Napoléon sur le champ de bataille d&#x27;Eylau, le 9 février 1807&quot; (Napoleon at the battlefield after the Battle of Eylau) now in the Louvre.

==Salon of 1804==
At the Salon of 1804, Gros debuted his painting &quot;Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa&quot;. The painting launched his career as a successful painter. It depicts Bonaparte in Jaffa visiting soldiers infected with the bubonic plague. He is portrayed reaching out to one of the sick, unfazed by the illness. According to P. Jill Morse, Napoleon commissioned Gros to paint the scene to neutralize British propaganda. The propaganda focused on two episodes of the Egyptian campaign (1798-1800). First when he ordered the massacre of Turkish prisoners. Second, when he ordered the death by poison of French soldiers suffering from the plague. The painting showed a compassionate Napoleon visiting the sick at the plague hospital. Morse adds that Gros was probably using the disease as a metaphor for the vanity of Napoleon and his First Empire.

While Bonaparte did actually visit the pesthouse, later, as his army prepared to withdraw from Syria, he ordered the poisoning (with laudanum) of about fifty of his plague-infected men.

==Later life==

In 1810, his &quot;Madrid&quot; and &quot;Napoleon at the Pyramids&quot; (Versailles) show that Napoleon had deserted him. His Francis I and Charles V, 1812 (Louvre), had considerable success.

In 1835, out of sympathy with the rising tide of Romanticism and after the failure of his &quot;Hercules and Diomedes&quot; at the Salon of 1835, Gros committed suicide by drowning.

==Fame==
Gros was made a member of the Legion of Honour on 22 October 1808 by Napoleon, after the Salon of 1808, where he had exhibited the &quot;Battle of Eylau&quot;. Gros had many pupils and gained considerably more after David left Paris in 1815.

Under the Bourbon Restoration, Gros became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts, and a member of the Order of Saint Michael. He was granted the title of baron in 1824 by King Charles X of France.

Gros inspired Eugène Delacroix, especially with his work in lithography. The two both worked during the same time period, and both did portraits of Napoleon. However, at one point, Gros had referred to Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Chios and Missolonghi&quot; as &quot;a massacre of art&quot;.

G. Dargenty produced a book on the subject entitled &quot;Les Artistes célèbres. Le Bon Gros&quot; (1887).

M. Delcluze gave a brief notice of his life in &quot;Louis David et son temps&quot; (&quot;Louis David and his times&quot;), and Julius Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der modernen französischen Malerei&quot; (&quot;History of Modern French Painting&quot;) contains what &quot;Britannica&quot; cites as an excellent criticism on his works.

<text>Mary Elizabeth Delahunty (born 7 June 1951) is an Australian journalist and former politician from the Labor Party.

==Early life==
Delahunty was born in the Victorian town of Murtoa and educated at Loreto College in Ballarat. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science from La Trobe University.

==Media career==
Delahunty was a news journalist for the ABC and Network Ten from 1975 to 1996. She appeared in news and current affairs programs such as &quot;Four Corners&quot; and &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot;. She received a Gold Walkley award for the story &quot;Aiding and Abetting&quot; which was shown and produced by &quot;Four Corners&quot; in 1983.

&quot;Aiding and Abetting&quot; was about the improper use of Australian aid money in the Philippines. In the late 1980s, Delahunty, then the chief newsreader for the ABC in Victoria, was parodied by comedian Jean Kittson on &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, where Kittson portrayed a snobbish, acid-tongued announcer called Veronica Glenhuntly (whose surname was taken from that of the elite Melbourne suburb). Delahunty was the weeknight presenter of &quot;ABC News Victoria&quot; from 1986 until 1990. She was replaced by Sue McIntosh.

==Political career==
Delahunty was elected to the seat of Northcote in the Victorian Legislative Assembly at a 1998 by-election. Her maiden speech was about the implications of the Fitzgerald report for Victoria, especially in regard to police corruption.

Delahunty was Minister for Education from 1999 to 2002, during the term of the first Bracks Government. She was the Minister for the Arts from 1999 to 2006, Minister for Women&#x27;s Affairs from 2002 to 2006, and Minister for Planning from 2002 to 2005. As Minister for Planning, she was responsible for the media presentation of &quot;Melbourne 2030&quot;.

As Minister for Planning, Delahunty was criticised for the altering of the annual Surveyor-General&#x27;s Report 2002–03, submitted by the Surveyor-General of Victoria, Keith Clifford Bell. The acting Victorian Ombudsman announced in January 2004 that he would &quot;investigate why the former Surveyor-General&#x27;s final annual report was substantially altered before being tabled in State Parliament last November&quot; He also announced he would investigate the misuse of the Surveyor-General&#x27;s electronic signature by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. The Auditor-General confirmed it would keep a watching brief over the investigations. It was also confirmed that the government ignored the advice of the office of the Victorian Government Solicitor &quot;to not interfere with the report&quot;. Bell, himself had confirmed that the report had been altered. The complaint to the ombudsman leading to the investigation had come from the then opposition planning spokesman Ted Baillieu. Efforts to alter or block Bell&#x27;s reports from 1999 to 1901 and 2000–01, had also occurred under the former Minister Sherryl Garbutt. Garbutt had made claims the reports were inaccurate, but they were subsequently tabled without any alteration.

The ombudsman&#x27;s investigation found substantial sections altered after Bell had finished his term as Surveyor-General. It also found that Bell&#x27;s signature was assigned to the Annual Report 2002-03 of the Surveyors Board of Victoria, without his knowledge or consent. The government was directed to apologise to Bell. Shadow Planning Minister, Ted Baillieu, in his statement to the Parliament on 9 April 2003 reported on the political interference at multiple levels, including the Planning Minister, in the performance of the responsibilities of the Surveyor-General. Bell was acknowledged as a competent, highly respected public servant and he was held in the highest esteem by both the surveying profession and the business sector. In a further statement to Parliament on 4 May 2005, Baillieu commented on the &quot;doctoring&quot; of Bell&#x27;s report, which had been done at the Minister&#x27;s direction. Baillieu further cited the Ombudsman&#x27;s findings that the altering of the report was inappropriate and there were concerns regarding the adequacy of the investigations. It was claimed that then Planning Minister Delahunty had misled the Parliament. The tabled report bears the hand-written note signed by Bell&#x27;s successor: &quot;Amended by the direction of the Minister. John E.Tulloch Surveyor General of Victoria 19/4/2005”.

Previously, in 2002, the Auditor-General reviewed the functions and responsibilities of the Surveyor-General and agreed with reports submitted by Bell. The Auditor-General identified the interference by Land Victoria in the performance of the Surveyor-General&#x27;s responsibilities, including the wrongful transfer of the Surveyor-General&#x27;s responsibilities to business units of Land Victoria outside of the Office of Surveyor-General. He confirmed that such responsibilities cannot be transferred without legislative mandate. The Auditor-General found that the transfer of the functions of the Surveyor-General had seen them delivered unsatisfactorily and did not meet the obligations of the legislation. The Opposition blamed Delahunty and her predecessor Sherryl Garbutt, for alleged political interference in the performance of the Surveyor-General&#x27;s responsibilities. Such interference included: attempts to block or alter annual reports from Bell; affix his electronic signature without his knowledge or permission; threats and intimidation by the former executive director of Land Victoria Elizabeth O&#x27;Keeffe; hiring of private investigators to investigate Bell and his office; and efforts to interfere with his review of State electoral boundaries in his capacity as an Electoral Boundaries Commissioner.

In January 2005 Premier Bracks dumped Delahunty as Planning Minister. Rob Hulls replaced Delahunty in what the media reported as an &quot;increasingly controversial&quot; ministerial portfolio. Delahunty commented in the media that in late February 2005 &quot;she picked up The Sunday Age to read that members of the ruling Right faction of the ALP wanted her out of her safe seat.&quot; In October 2006, Delahunty advised that she would not contest the November 2006 election due to health and family reasons.

==Personal life==
Delahunty is the sister of Victorian National Party MP, Hugh Delahunty, who is also a former Victorian Football League player, as is another brother, Michael. Her husband of 22 years, the journalist Jock Rankin, died in 2002. She has two children, Nicholas and Olivia. She was a guest on &quot;Life Matters&quot; (ABC Radio National, 26 August 2010) on such topics as grief, parenting, civic participation and public life, and her memoir, &quot;Public Life, Private Grief&quot;.

<text>The Society of Merchant Venturers is a charitable organisation in the English city of Bristol. The society can be traced back to a 13th-century guild which went on to fund the 15th-century voyage of John Cabot to Canada. In 1552, it gained a monopoly on sea trading from Bristol from its first royal charter. For centuries it had almost been synonymous with the government of Bristol, especially Bristol Harbour. In recent times, the society&#x27;s activities have centred on charitable agendas.

The society played a part in the development of Bristol, including the building of Clifton Suspension Bridge and the Great Western Railway. It also influenced the development of educational institutions in Greater Bristol, including University of Bristol, University of the West of England, University of Bath, City of Bristol College, Merchants&#x27; Academy, Montpelier High School and Wells Cathedral School. 

==History==
A Guild of Merchants was founded in Bristol by the 13th century, and swiftly became active in civic life. It funded John Cabot&#x27;s voyage of discovery to Newfoundland in 1497. The society in its current form was established by a 1552 Royal Charter from Edward VI granting the society a monopoly on Bristol&#x27;s sea trade. The society remained in effective control of Bristol&#x27;s harbour until 1809. Further charters were granted by Charles I, Charles II and Elizabeth II. The society&#x27;s members were active in the English colonisation of North America, helping to establish the Bristol&#x27;s Hope and Cuper&#x27;s Cove settlements in Newfoundland.
From the accession of William III in 1689, the society promoted trade protectionism which resulted in Parliament enacting policies such as restricting exports from Ireland and banning imports into Ireland from anywhere except England &#x27;with deplorable results&#x27;.

In 1698 the society successfully lobbied Parliament to open up the slave trade to all subjects of the Crown. Over the next fifty years, the society joined with the city corporation and Bristol MPs in fighting numerous attempts to restore London&#x27;s monopoly. Joseph Harford, a member of the society who would go on to become Master in 1796, was both a banker and a brass manufacturer, and thus a beneficiary of the trade. He was also the first chairman in 1788 of Bristol&#x27;s provincial committee for the abolition of slavery, when opinion was becoming more divided.

During the eighteenth century one quarter of the individual members of the society were directly involved in the slave trade, including Michael Becher, Edward Colston, John Duckenfield, and Isaac Hobhouse.

The first light on the island of Flat Holm was a simple brazier mounted on a wooden frame, which stood on the high eastern part of the island. In 1733 the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol found the brazier to be unreliable and petitioned the general lighthouse authority, Trinity House, for an actual lighthouse, but the petition failed. In 1735 William Crispe of Bristol submitted a proposal to build a lighthouse at his own expense. This initial proposal also failed but negotiations resumed in 1736 when 60 soldiers drowned after their vessel crashed on the Wolves rocks near Flat Holm. Following this disaster, the Society of Merchant Venturers supported William Crispe&#x27;s proposal. Crispe agreed to pay £800 (£110,552, $220,241 in 2008) for the construction of the tower as well as the fees permits. The construction of the tower finished in 1737 and it began operating on 25 March 1738.

The costs of the construction of Bristol&#x27;s Floating Harbour, completed in 1809, were far beyond the limited resources of the society and necessitated the setting up of the Bristol Docks Company. Although the society was represented on the board, it ceded its role in the management of the port of Bristol, which had dominated its activities throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In the 19th century the society helped to fund the building of Clifton Suspension Bridge and members of the society helped to establish the Great Western Railway. In the 1860s the society acted with the Bristol Corporation to put Clifton Down and the adjoining Durdham Down under the control of a single Downs Committee. The society&#x27;s members wanted to protect the land from future development and ensure that it remained available to the people of the city. The creation of the Downs Act in 1861 brought together Clifton Down with Durdham Down, setting out a long-term partnership to protect this open green space. Representatives from Bristol City Council and members of the society form the Downs Committee which meets regularly to ensure that the Downs is maintained and improved for the long term. Alderman Proctor&#x27;s Drinking Fountain on Clifton Down was built in 1872 by G. and H. Godwin in a Gothic Revival style to commemorate the society&#x27;s presentation in 1861 of &quot;certain rights over Clifton Down made to the citizens&quot; of Bristol.

The society contributed a total sum of £26 towards the construction of the statue of Edward Colston, which was completed in 1895 – 170 years after Colston&#x27;s death. With growing awareness in the late 20th century of his involvement in the Bristol slave trade, there were protests and petitions for changes to institutions named after Colston, alterations to the statue&#x27;s plaque, or for the statue to be removed, culminating in June 2020, when the statue was toppled and dumped in Bristol Harbour by Black Lives Matter protesters. After the statue was toppled, the Merchant Venturers issued a statement claiming that it had been &quot;inappropriate&quot; for them to have become involved in the rewording of the plaque in 2018.

In the sixteenth century the society had maintained a free school for mariners&#x27; children under the Merchants&#x27; Hall in King Street. A century later sailors were being instructed in the &#x27;Arte of Navigacion&#x27;. This was to evolve into the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College in Unity Street towards the end of the nineteenth century when over 2,500 students were enrolled. When University College, Bristol achieved its charter as the University of Bristol in 1909, the Merchant Venturers&#x27; Technical College provided the faculty of engineering, whilst the remaining departments of the college eventually became the University of the West of England. At the beginning of the eighteenth century the society took on Edward Colston&#x27;s &#x27;Colston&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;, a school for 100 boys (now Colston&#x27;s School). This moved to Stapleton in 1861, becoming co-educational in 1991. In 1891 Colston&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (now Montpelier High School) was opened on Cheltenham Road using funds from Edward Colston&#x27;s endowment. It became an academy in 2008, when Withywood School reopened as Merchants&#x27; Academy. In 2016 the Bristol Autism Free School, now called Venturers&#x27; Academy, opened nearby. Since 2017 the society and the University of Bristol have jointly sponsored five primary schools, a secondary school, an all-through school and a special school in Bristol. The overarching Venturers&#x27; Trust now oversees the education of more than 3,200 students.

The Merchant Venturers cared for twelve poor mariners in the sixteenth century and the society continues to be involved with the care for older people. The society has managed Colstons Almshouses on St Michael&#x27;s Hill since its foundation by Edward Colston in 1696. Since 1922 the society has been the endowment trustee for the independent charity, the St Monica Trust, enabling very substantial developments to accommodate older people in recent years. The Society has also been sole trustee of the Cote Charity, set up in 1968, which in 2009 opened Katherine House, a residential care home and in 2016, Griffiths House for those living with dementia.

==Involvement in the slave trade==

The society was an active participant in the transatlantic slave trade from the seventeenth century until the eighteenth century.

===Edward Colston&#x27;s membership===
The society says that Edward Colston became a member of the slave trading Royal African Company in 1680 and joined the society in 1683, continuing to live in London and attending two meetings.

==Archives==
Records of the Society of Merchant Venturers including foundation and membership, administrative, financial, charities, education, estates management, trade, associated clubs and societies, the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital Fund, and various name indexes are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. SMV) (online catalogue) as well as further papers and correspondence related to the Society of Merchant Venturers&#x27; interests (Ref. 12152) (online catalogue). Other deeds and estate papers related to the society&#x27;s interests in Somerset and Dorset are available at Somerset Heritage Centre.

==Current status==
The Society of Merchant Venturers comprises men and women who volunteer their skills and expertise to support the organisation&#x27;s objectives.
The Merchant Venturers work closely with the wider community and many of its members play a role in Bristol&#x27;s commercial life and the institutions within the city. Its objectives are to:
# Contribute to the prosperity and well-being of the greater Bristol area through active support of enterprise and commercial and community activity;
# Enhance the quality of life for all, particularly for the young, aged and disadvantaged;
# Promote learning and the acquisition of skills by supporting education;
# Act as effective stewards of the charitable trusts, heritage, ancient buildings and open spaces for which the society is responsible.

==Criticisms==

According to an article in local magazine &quot;Venue&quot; in 2002, many members were not active in charity. However, the society says that the qualification for potential members is being &quot;prominent in their own sphere of business and active in the charitable or public life of the area&quot;. There were no female full members of the society until 2003 (though Margaret Thatcher had earlier been made an honorary member), and no ethnic minority members until 2017 when Mohammed Saddiq, executive director of Wessex Water, was appointed; followed by Marti Burgess in 2020, a partner at Bevan Brittan.

&quot;Venue&quot; said that the Merchant Venturers control 12 charities and 40 trust funds, and also a private unlimited company, SMV Investments, that has major investments in defence contracting, tobacco, genetically modified agriculture and the petroleum industry. Merchant Venturers serve on the boards of many local charitable and cultural organisations, and are guaranteed seats on the University of Bristol Court and the Downs Committee. It quotes Paul Burton of the university&#x27;s School of Policy Studies as saying, &quot;they exert quite a bit of influence and we, the people of Bristol, don&#x27;t know much about them and can&#x27;t hold them to account&quot;.

In January 2022 Thangam Debbonaire, the MP for Bristol West whose constituency includes the Merchants’ headquarters in Clifton, told the &quot;Bristol Post&quot; that she believed it was time for the society to disband, calling them an &quot;unaccountable, undemocratic network with no place in a modern, multicultural Bristol&quot;.

===Statue of Edward Colston===
On 7 June 2020, during international Black Lives Matter demonstrations provoked by the murder of George Floyd, a group of protestors in Bristol pulled down the 1895 statue of Edward Colston that stood in Magpie Park in The Centre, Bristol, objecting to the veneration of Edward Colston, a slave-trader, and pushed it into the harbour. During ensuing debate over the legitimacy of this act, the Society of Merchant Venturers was accused of having used its influence to block previous attempts to remove the statue legally. In response to the statue&#x27;s removal, a spokesperson for the Merchant Venturers promised the society would &quot;continue to educate itself about systemic racism&quot;.

==Heraldry==

The company&#x27;s arms are blazoned as follows:

Arms: &quot;Barry wavy of eight argent and azure, on a bend or, a dragon passant with wings indorsed and tail extended vert, on achief gules, a lion passant guardant of the third, between two bezants.&quot; Crest: &quot;In a ducal coronet or, a main-mast of the last with pennon flying argent, charged with a cross gules, on the round top a man in armour proper, on his dexter arm a truncheon, his sinister hand supporting a carved shield of the second, from the round top six pike staves, three on each side issuing bendways of the first, the rigging from the round top to the coronet sable.&quot; Supporters: &quot;The dexter, a mermaid in the sea, all proper crined or, the middle fins at the joining of the bodies of the last, holding in her sinister hand a mirror of the first, and supporting with her dexter hand an anchor of the second, cabled proper: the sinister supporter, a winged satyr proper standing on a mount vert, winged and legged or, holding in his sinister hand a scythe the blade in base, all proper.&quot; Motto: &quot;Indocilis pauperiem pati.&quot;

The motto &quot;&quot; is from the &quot;Odes&quot; of Horace.

<doc id="854611" wikidata="Q1346731" url="?curid=854611" title="Jacques Gaillot">
<text>Jacques Gaillot (; 11 September 1935 – 12 April 2023) was a French Catholic clergyman and social activist. He was Bishop of Évreux in France from 1982 to 1995. In 1995, Pope John Paul II removed him as head of his diocese because he publicly expressed controversial and heterodox positions on religious, political, and social matters. These views earned Gaillot the popular nickname &quot;the Red Cleric.&quot;

From 1995, Gaillot was bishop of the titular see of Parthenia. His online ministry to dissidents in the Catholic Church under the name &quot;Partenia&quot; has since been described as the Catholic Church&#x27;s first virtual diocese.

==Early life and priesthood==
Jacques Gaillot was born in Saint-Dizier, Haute-Marne, on 11 September 1935. After his secondary studies, he entered the seminary in Langres. From 1957 to 1959, he performed his compulsory military service in Algeria during the Algerian War. From 1960 to 1962 he completed his studies in theology in Rome, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He was ordained a priest in 1961.

From 1962 to 1964, he studied at the Higher Institute for Liturgy in Paris and taught at the major seminary in Châlons-en-Champagne. Beginning in 1965, he was a professor at the regional seminary of Reims, where he chaired sessions for the implementation of the principles of the Second Vatican Council.

In 1973, he was assigned to the parish of St Dizier in his hometown and became co-manager of the institute for the training of seminary instructors in Paris. In 1977, he was appointed vicar general of the Diocese of Langres. When the see became vacant in 1981, he was elected diocesan administrator.

==Bishop of Évreux==
On 5 May 1982, Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Évreux. He received his episcopal consecration on 20 June from Léon Aimé Taverdet, Bishop of Langres. In his first Easter message he wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m not here to convince the convinced or take care of the well. I&#x27;m here to support the ill and offer a hand to the lost. Does a bishop remain in his cathedral or does he go into the street? ... I made my choice.&quot;

In 1983, Gaillot publicly supported a conscientious objector in Évreux who declined to perform alternative service in forestry on the grounds that it did not contribute to the relief of the destitute or promote peace. During the annual assembly of the French episcopate, he was one of two bishops (of a total of 110) who voted against a text which supported nuclear deterrence.

In 1984, Gaillot declined to join large-scale Church-led public demonstrations in favour of French parochial schools and signed petitions in favour of secular education.

In January 1985, Gaillot drew sustained media attention for the first time when he signed an appeal on behalf of underpaid Catholic school teachers; also signing the appeal was Georges Marchais, the head of the French Communist Party. In response, conservatives in Gaillot&#x27;s diocese described him as &quot;a tool of the church&#x27;s worst enemies&quot;, while the right-leaning newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; spearheaded a campaign against him. Also in 1985, Gaillot supported the First Palestinian Intifada.

In 1987, he went to South Africa to meet a young anti-apartheid militant from Évreux sentenced to four years in prison by the South African régime. There he also appeared at a demonstration where some Communist militants were also demonstrating. In order to accomplish this trip, he had to renounce going with the diocesan pilgrimage to Lourdes, a move that drew criticism. Further, in the same year, he also announced that the French Bishops &quot;remain too preoccupied by the correct functioning of the church and its structures.&quot; This only ensured that the responses to Gaillot when he later attacked the right-wing French political party, the National Front, were even stronger. Also in 1987, Gaillot traveled to Athens to show solidarity with Palestinian refugees. Perhaps the most notable event he performed in 1987 was attending, by invitation, a special session of the United Nations in New York to speak out for disarmament.

In 1988, during a closed-door session of the annual assembly of the French episcopate in Lourdes, he advocated the ordination of married men to the priesthood. After the proceedings had finished Gaillot spoke to the press about the discussions held and also promoted his own viewpoints. By promoting a revision of clerical celibacy and the use of condoms, he caused considerable tension with the French bishops&#x27; conference, the situation being exacerbated by the fact that in speaking to the media about the session, Gaillot had violated convention regarding assembly conclaves. He later defended his previous actions, remarking that &quot;I never broke the vow of celibacy ... I only questioned it. But that&#x27;s worse.&quot; Also that year, Gaillot took the unprecedented step for a Roman Catholic bishop of blessing a homosexual union in a &quot;service of welcoming,&quot; after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from AIDS.

In 1989, Galliot participated in a trip to French Polynesia organized by the peace movement, asking for the end to French nuclear testing.

Gaillot also participated in the ceremony of the transfer of the ashes of the late bishop Baptiste-Henri Grégoire (1750–1831) to the Panthéon, a necropolis for the great men of France. Grégoire had been instrumental in the first abolition of slavery, and the end of discrimination against Blacks and Jews during the French Revolution. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had refused to give him the last sacraments because of Grégoire&#x27;s acceptance of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Gaillot was the only French bishop participating in this ceremony.

The French journalist Henri Tincq wrote in &quot;Le Monde&quot; that Gaillot &quot;has the merit of saying out loud what many people in authority in the church think deep down&quot;.

In 1989, the French Bishops&#x27; Conference, to the extent that the members of the episcopate voted to censure him after Gaillot gave an interview to the publication &quot;Lui&quot;, a publication known for its explicit sexual content. He also gave interviews to leading gay magazines and criticized his peers as incompetent to judge the circumstances of gays and lesbians. Gaillot offered to resign but the Vatican did not respond.

Toward late 1989, he made a conciliatory gesture by signing a promise of &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;docility&quot; to the papal authority. A week later, Gaillot appeared on television and spoke of the &quot;feeble state of internal debate in the church&quot; and express disappointment that progress had not been made since the Second Vatican Council.

In 1991, he opposed the Gulf War, publishing a book called &quot;Open letter to those who preach war, but let it be waged by others&quot;. He also condemned the embargo on Iraq. By the end of 1991, the French Bishops&#x27; Conference had censured Gaillot three times, most recently for his intervention in Haiti, rousing support for Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

Gaillot&#x27;s book &quot;A Rant on Exclusion&quot; (&quot;Coup de gueule contre l&#x27;exclusion&quot;) was published in March 1994. It criticized the French laws on immigration proposed by Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua.

On 12 April 1994, Gaillot appeared on television in a discussion with dissident Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann. On 14 April, Archbishop Joseph Duval, the president of the Bishops Conference of France and Gaillot&#x27;s superior as metropolitan archbishop of Rouen, wrote to Gaillot: &quot;For all to see you are in solidarity with Drewermann. But how do you show your solidarity with us, your fellow episcopal brothers and the Pope? Are you aware that your position is unsustainable? The distance from your brothers in the episcopate that you emphasize makes us suffer and has become a scandal for many Catholics.&quot; Gaillot at one point offered to resign, but withdrew his offer, fearing that the Vatican might resolve his case as it had that of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen in 1987 by appointing an auxiliary bishop with special authority.

Gaillot was the target of a bitter campaign to disparage his name. Unsubstantiated allegations of homosexuality, racism, anti-Semitism, and psychosis and neurosis were made by highly placed authorities in the French hierarchy. Gaillot responded by calling Duval an &quot;ayatollah&quot; seeking to impose &quot;ideological uniformity&quot; within the French Bishops Conference. He compared the leadership style of Cardinal Bernadin Gantin, head of the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for Bishops, to that of the Stasi, the East German security police.

==Removal from Évreux==
Gantin summoned Gaillot to a meeting at the Vatican on 13 January 1995 and offered the choice of resigning his see or being removed from his office. Gaillot returned to France and issued a statement that said: &quot;I was asked to hand in my resignation, which I thought I had good reasons to refuse.&quot; Having refused to resign, he was removed and denied the use of the title &quot;bishop emeritus&quot;. As all bishops need to be assigned to a see (diocese), he was assigned the titular see of Parthenia on 13 January 1995.

The Church named two bishops to stay in contact with Gaillot.

===Reaction to removal===
This removal sparked an emotional response from thousands of people across France and the rest of the world. Twenty thousand people gathered outside the cathedral in Évreux when he offered his last Mass there on 22 January. Four French bishops demonstrated their support by attending the service, where Gaillot said: &quot;This should be a Church of the marginalised, not a Church that marginalises.&quot; The crowd stayed on the streets protesting the Vatican&#x27;s decision. Protestors united under the leadership of the Communist mayor of the region and marched through the streets in the rain. Although still a bishop he left his cross, mitre and staff behind in Évreux.

The decision to remove Gaillot as ordinary of Évreux was widely seen as a mistake by both lay people and clergy, and also by many non-religious people who had come to view Gaillot favorably. After his removal, a reported forty thousand people wrote letters to the cathedral office at Évreux, with more being sent to the Vatican and eminent prelates. He was perceived favorably by a significant number of people, particularly due to his ministry to all people without distinction. In addition, he had become a national figure after the sanctions taken against him.

Polls taken at the time consistently revealed the French public to be against the punishment brought upon Gaillot. One CSA survey showed that total of 64 percent of the public was against the firing of Jacques Gaillot as bishop of Évreux, with only 11 percent approving of his firing and the remaining 25 percent being undecided. Some later polls showed that support for Gaillot might even have been as high as 75 percent.

Reactions from other French bishops varied. No French bishop expressed public support for Gaillot, but the spokesperson for the hierarchy reported that both Cardinal Robert-Joseph Coffy of Marseille and Archbishop Duval were &quot;visibly troubled&quot; by the Vatican&#x27;s action. Duval released a statement that said: &quot;I pleaded for patience in Rome.&quot; Duval later said that he &quot;regretted&quot; what Rome had done and called it &quot;an authoritarian act which cannot be accepted by society, even if it is carried out by the Church.&quot;

The Archbishop of Cambrai, Jacques Delaporte, defended Gaillot and called his removal &quot;a wound for our church... a source of misunderstanding for the poor and for all those who seek the truth and who put their trust in the church.&quot;

By the time he left his position in Évreux, he had visited more prisons than any bishop in France&#x27;s history.

==After Évreux==
After being removed from his position as prelate of Évreux, Gaillot wrote:

After leaving the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Gaillot immediately moved in with illegal squatters in Paris&#x27; infamous Rue de Dragon. Since then he had shown similar solidarity with the homeless. Bishop Gaillot continued to defend human rights and engage in activism, regularly publishing information about his activities on the website of Parthenia.

Gaillot remained active as a pastor to the excluded. He also travelled throughout France and also internationally, spreading the word of the Christian Gospel and defending those who are considered &quot;outcasts&quot; (namely immigrants). He was an avid anti-war protester and is considered by many to be a strong socialist. Gaillot had a strong friendship with Abbé Pierre.

In 1995, after his removal as Bishop of Évreux, Gaillot attended a Call to Action conference in Detroit as one of the keynote speakers. He held three sessions, proving to be popular despite speaking through a translator. He hosted the conference alongside other controversial Catholic theologians including Hans Küng and Thomas Gumbleton.

Free of responsibility for a functioning diocese, Gaillot became even more daring in his activism. In July 1995, Gaillot engaged in protests against French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia. Aboard the Greenpeace vessel &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, part of a fleet of protest ships, he was removed from the ship along with its other protestors and journalists by French commandos, after the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; sailed within the exclusion zone, and escorted back to the atoll.

Twice bishops prohibited Gaillot from speaking in their dioceses. In 2000, Pope John Paul II forbade his participation in a conference in Rome about religion and homosexuals. Cardinal Joachim Meisner of Cologne prohibited Gaillot from addressing a World Youth Day event in Bonn in 2004.

Also in 2004 Bishop Gaillot met with Maryam Rajavi, an Iranian political activist president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Gaillot strongly criticized the actions of some extremist religious leaders in Iran, going on to comment that “One must not forget that the strength of truth will make it [the Iranian resistance] triumphant. Darkness will give way and truth will prevail despite all the lies and ruses”. Rajavi publicly thanked the bishop and expressed that his support had been very effective in promoting the cause of the Iran resistance.

Gaillot also took the position as a well-known public figure in France, fighting for a number of causes; Gaillot served as the co-chairman of one of France&#x27;s foremost human rights activist groups, &quot; (Rights First), among other groups.

In 2007 Gaillot posted a video interview on &quot;Google Video&quot;, attempting to bring attention to the escalating violence in Darfur.

He wrote a book shortly after his removal from Évreux, which was published in 1996 and titled &quot;Voice from the Desert: A Bishop&#x27;s Cry for a New Church&quot; (English translation). It is a largely autobiographical discussion of the events surrounding his removal.

==Reconciliation with Church authorities==
In 2000, Louis-Marie Billé, Archbishop of Lyon and president of the French Episcopal Conference, invited Gaillot to attend a national ecumenical service in Lyon on 14 May alongside other senior members of the French hierarchy. Billé said the invitation came from the bishops as a group: &quot;It is important that Catholics, and public opinion in general, are aware that the communion that links us as brothers is real, even when it is lived out in a special fashion. What happened five years ago remains a wound even for those who don&#x27;t necessarily share Mgr Gaillot&#x27;s opinions.&quot; There was no indication that the pope or anyone in the Roman Curia was involved. Gaillot accepted, writing that he was &quot;happy to demonstrate my communion with the Church&quot;.

On 1 September 2015, shortly before his 80th birthday, Gaillot, accompanied by Daniel Duigou, a priest and former journalist, met privately with Pope Francis in his Vatican City residence for 45 minutes. Gaillot said the pontiff encouraged him to continue his activism on behalf of migrants and refugees. After the meeting, Gaillot said he was &quot;in love&quot; with Francis.

==Death==
Gaillot moved to a retirement home in Paris in November 2022. He died in Paris on 12 April 2023, at the age of 87. He suffered from pancreatic cancer and had been hospitalized a week earlier.

<text>FirstGroup plc is a British multi-national transport group, based in Aberdeen, Scotland. The company operates transport services in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

The creation of what became FirstGroup is closely tied to the deregulation of bus services in the United Kingdom during the 1980s. During April 1995, two acquisitive private bus operators, Badgerline and GRT Bus Group, merged to create FirstBus. The new company initially operated a fleet of 5,600 buses to provide services to numerous regions across England, Wales and Scotland. Throughout the late 1990s, FirstBus continued its policy of growth by acquisition. To this end, it acquired several former council owned operations and companies formerly owned by English, Welsh and Scottish nationalised operators.

During December 1997, the company was renamed &quot;FirstGroup&quot; to reflect its entry into Britain&#x27;s recently privatised railways. Around this time, it had a 24.5% shareholding in Great Western Holdings that was awarded the Great Western and North Western franchises, as well as a 100% shareholding in First Great Eastern. FirstGroup made its first overseas foray in September 1998 via a 26% shareholding in the joint venture New World First Bus that provided bus services in Hong Kong. In September 1999, FirstGroup purchased the American company Ryder Public Transport Services. During May 2000, it began operating the London Tramlink concession. During August 2003, FirstGroup purchased GB Railways, which owned Anglia Railways and GB Railfreight and held 80% of the shares in Hull Trains.

In February 2007, FirstGroup agreed to buy the US-based bus operator Laidlaw, along with a controlling stake in Greyhound Lines, the largest bus operator in North America. During June 2009, FirstGroup made an unsuccessful takeover bid for rival transport operator National Express. In June 2010, FirstGroup sold its rail freight business First GBRf to the Eurotunnel Group, exiting the rail freight sector as a result. During October 2016, First Transit commenced operating the A-train, its first rail operation in the United States. In August 2017, FirstGroup&#x27;s joint venture with MTR Corporation commenced operating the South Western franchise. In May 2020, FirstGroup announced it would retain its UK bus operations and sell off its activities in North America. During June 2022, FirstGroup rejected a £1.2bn takeover offer from US private equity company I Squared Capital.

==History==
===Origins and early acquisitions===

FirstGroup originated within the deregulation of bus services in the United Kingdom in 1986, whereby private companies purchased nationalised and municipal bus operators. During September 1986, the Somerset based services of the Bristol Omnibus Company that were rebranded in 1985 as Badgerline were purchased in a management buyout. As Badgerline Group, it expanded through acquisition purchasing other formerly nationalised bus companies in England and Wales.

In January 1989, Grampian Regional Transport, the bus operator in Aberdeen owned by Grampian Regional Council, was privatised in a management buyout led by its then general manager, Moir Lockhead. As GRT Bus Group, it expanded through acquisition purchasing six former nationalised bus companies in England and Scotland. During April 1995, FirstBus was formed through the merger of the Badgerline and GRT Bus Groups, with fleets in England, Wales and Scotland. The former King Street Barracks site in Aberdeen was selected as the headquarters. At the time of the merger, FirstBus had 5,600 buses, 4,000 of which came from Badgerline. Badgerline&#x27;s Trevor Smallwood became chairman of FirstBus, while GRT head Moir Lockhead became deputy chairman and chief executive.

Throughout the late 1990s, FirstBus continued its policy of growth by acquisition. To this end, it acquired several former council owned operations and companies formerly owned by English, Welsh and Scottish nationalised operators. FirstBus went on to acquire larger urban metropolitan operators by taking advantage of the privatisation of the PTE bus operations and the privatisation of London bus services. FirstBus acquired GM Buses North in Manchester and Strathclyde Buses in Glasgow in 1996, Mainline in South Yorkshire and CentreWest in London in 1997, and Capital Citybus in London in 1998.

===FirstGroup and expansion===

During December 1997, the company was renamed &quot;FirstGroup&quot;; this change was due to the company&#x27;s entry in February 1996 into Britain&#x27;s recently privatised railways, having a 24.5% shareholding in Great Western Holdings that won the Great Western and North Western franchises, and a 100% shareholding in First Great Eastern that ran the Great Eastern franchise from January 1997. In March 1998, FirstGroup purchased the 75.5% shares in Great Western Holdings that it did not already own and rebranded the franchises First Great Western and First North Western.

In September 1998, FirstGroup made its first overseas foray when New World First Bus commenced operating bus services in Hong Kong formerly operated by China Motor Bus; the company held a 26% shareholding in the joint venture. During May 2000, FirstGroup sold its shares to joint venture partner New World Development. In September 1999, FirstGroup purchased Ryder Public Transport Services, a provider of school bus and contracted public bus transportation in the United States. In May 2000, FirstGroup began operating the London Tramlink concession under contract to Transport for London.
During August 2003, FirstGroup purchased GB Railways, which owned Anglia Railways and GB Railfreight and held 80% of the shares in Hull Trains. Having not been shortlisted for the Greater Anglia franchise, this outcome gave FirstGroup another chance to bid. However, it too was unsuccessful and the franchise was awarded to the rival transport company National Express from April 2004, including the services operated by First Great Eastern. In November 2003, FirstGroup purchased a 90% shareholding in Irish coach operator Aircoach.

In February 2004, FirstGroup&#x27;s joint venture with Keolis commenced operating the First TransPennine Express rail franchise, FirstGroup having a 55% shareholding in the venture. During April 2004, FirstGroup commenced operating the First Great Western Link franchise, it also commenced the First ScotRail franchise in October 2004. In December 2004, the remainder of First North Western passed to Northern Rail, some services having already been transferred to Arriva Trains Wales and FirstTranspennine Express.

During April 2006, FirstGroup commenced operating the First Capital Connect franchise and a renewed First Great Western franchise that had been expanded to include the Thames Trains and Wessex Trains franchises.
In February 2007, FirstGroup agreed to buy the US-based firm Laidlaw, an operator of inter-city coaches and yellow school buses across North America, in exchange for £1.9 billion (US$3.7 billion). This also gave it a controlling stake in Greyhound Lines, the largest bus operator in North America. The Greyhound name and the names of Canadian subsidiaries of Greyhound Canada were retained, and all other Laidlaw-owned services in the United States and Canada were rebranded under the First or Greyhound names, except for Voyageur Colonial and Grey Goose in Canada.

In January 2009, DSBFirst, FirstGroup&#x27;s joint venture with Danish State Railways commenced operating the Oresundtrain rail franchise from Helsingør and Nivå in Denmark along the Kystbanen line and over the Øresund Bridge to Malmö, Växjö, Kalmar, Karlskrona and Gothenburg in Sweden. FirstGroup had a 25% shareholding in the Danish business and 20% in the Swedish business. By March 2011, this shareholding had increased to 30%.

During June 2009, FirstGroup made a takeover offer for fellow transport operator National Express, which was struggling with debt at the time and was struggling to hold onto its National Express East Coast rail franchise. This offer was rejected; a National Express spokesperson stated that it did not &quot;consider it appropriate&quot; at the time to discuss a takeover. FirstGroup believed that there was &quot;significant industrial and commercial logic&quot; for a merger, but National Express wished to focus on its own initiatives.

===2010s===
In June 2010, FirstGroup sold its railfreight business First GBRf to the Eurotunnel Group in exchange for £31 million, ending the group&#x27;s involvement in rail freight transport. In September 2010, former London Underground managing director Tim O&#x27;Toole, already a board member since May 2009 and chief operating officer and Deputy Chief Executive since June 2010, was announced as the successor to retiring group chief executive officer Moir Lockhead with effect from 31 March 2011.

During September 2011, FirstGroup&#x27;s German bus operations were sold to Marwyn European Transport. In December 2011, DSBFirst ceased operating the Swedish part of the operation after difficulties encountered by Danish State Railways over cross subsidies.
In July 2012, First Travel Solutions provided bus and coach services for the London 2012 Olympic Games as First Games Transport. This involved the provision of venue shuttle and park and ride services, services connecting the peripheral park and ride sites on the M25 with the Olympic Park and Ebbsfleet, and a nationwide network of express coaches to the Olympic Park and the Weymouth and Portland sailing venue. These services required around 900 vehicles in total, although some were sub-contracted. During June 2013, most of the First London bus operations were sold to Go-Ahead London, Metroline and Tower Transit.

In April 2015, FirstGroup was unsuccessful in bidding for the ScotRail franchise, which was run by Abellio ScotRail until the end of that franchise in March 2022. During December 2015, FirstGroup was awarded the next TransPennine Express franchise. The new franchise commenced on 1 April 2016 with a commitment to introduce new trains, routes and faster journey times.

During October 2016, First Transit commenced operating the A-train under contract to the Denton County Transportation Authority, its first rail operation in the United States. In August 2017, FirstGroup&#x27;s joint venture with MTR Corporation commenced operating the South Western franchise, the company holding a 70% shareholding in South Western Railway.

In May 2019, FirstGroup announced its intention to sell its UK bus operations and that its US activities were to receive greater attention in the future. However, the only sales completed were parts of First Greater Manchester to the Go-Ahead Group and Rotala.

===2020s===

In May 2020, FirstGroup announced it has effectively reversed its previous strategy, opting to retain its UK bus operations and instead sell its assets in North America. In April 2021, FirstGroup agreed terms to sell the First Student and First Transit businesses to EQT; the sale completed later in 2021.

During October 2021, FirstGroup announced the sale of Greyhound Lines to Flixbus, completing its stated divestments to focus on its core UK public transport businesses. In October 2021, the open-access operator Lumo commenced operating services on the East Coast Main Line.

In June 2022, FirstGroup&#x27;s board unanimously rejected a £1.2bn takeover proposal from US private equity firm I Squared Capital; a spokesperson stated that the offer had undervalued the company. While talks between the two companies continued for a further two months, I Squared ultimately called off its efforts in August 2022.

In February 2023, FirstGroup announced that subject to regulatory approval, it would purchase both the bus services and bus dealer operations of Purfleet-based Ensignbus.

In January 2024, FirstGroup purchased York Pullman. In October 2024, FirstGroup purchased both Lakeside Group and Anderson Travel.

In September 2024, FirstGroup purchased Grand Union&#x27;s London Euston to Stirling operating rights. Then in December 2024, it purchased Grand Union&#x27;s other approved operating rights from London Paddington to Carmarthen.

Also in December 2024, FirstGroup announced it has agreed terms to purchase RATP Dev Transit London from RATP Group.

In January 2025, FirstGroup purchased Matthews Coach Hire.

==Operations==

FirstGroup is Britain&#x27;s largest bus operator, running more than 20% of all local bus services. A fleet of nearly 9,000 buses carries some 2.9 million passengers a day in more than 40 major towns and cities. FirstGroup also runs passenger rail services in the UK. Passenger rail franchises consist of Avanti West Coast, Great Western Railway and South Western Railway. It also runs two non-franchised open access passenger operations – Hull Trains and Lumo. FirstGroup operates tram services on the London Tramlink network carrying approximately 24 million passengers per year on behalf of Transport for London.

FirstGroup owns and operates the Aircoach service in Dublin, linking Dublin Airport with the city centre, the south side of Dublin, Greystones and Bray as well as long-distance express services runs to Cork and Belfast.

==Corporate branding and liveries==
FirstGroup has always had a consistent brand and uses the First brand for most of its operations. FirstBus began to apply a standard corporate typeface to its fleet names in the late 1990s, introducing the stylized &quot;f&quot; logo depicting a road. A corporate white, pink and blue livery nicknamed &quot;Barbie&quot; was introduced to new buses, while further bus company acquisitions continued. Inherited bus fleets were initially left in their original colours with First fleet names, with the intention that the Barbie scheme would stand for a set service quality. Later older buses received a modified &quot;Barbie 2&quot; livery.

As part of its corporate branding, First subsequently removed all local branding for its bus services, buses simply carried the &#x27;First&#x27; brand, although each company still operated independently. In 2012, the group began to introduce a new purple, white and lilac &#x27;Olympia&#x27; livery to its bus fleets, which also reinstated local branding. In January 2014, the company rebranded its First Somerset &amp; Avon operations in Bridgwater and Taunton as The Buses of Somerset, using a two-tone green livery.

The FirstGroup&#x27;s bus operations were rebranded again in December 2024, adopting a new logo that replaced the one used since the formation of FirstBus in April 1995 as well as the slogan of &#x27;Moving the Everyday&#x27;. This coincided with the introduction of a purple and grey livery, which had already begun to be rolled out onto the group&#x27;s bus fleets.

Hull Trains carries a predominantly blue livery, including white, pink and purple. This was also used by First Great Western until 20 September 2015, when the franchise was rebranded as Great Western Railway, with a new logo and dark green livery paying homage to the original Great Western Railway.

London Tramlink operations are painted in white, green and blue as per Transport for London requirements. In Scotland, First ScotRail operated with a blue livery with white saltire markings on the carriage ends, as mandated by the Scottish Government&#x27;s transport agency Transport Scotland.

<text>Barclay James Harvest were an English progressive rock band, which following a split in 1998 now exists as two successor bands. They were founded in Oldham, in September 1966 by bassist/vocalist Les Holroyd (born 1948), guitarist/vocalist John Lees (born 1947), drummer/percussionist Mel Pritchard (1948–2004), and keyboardist/vocalist Stuart &quot;Woolly&quot; Wolstenholme (1947–2010).

==History==
After signing with EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label in the UK for one single in early 1968 (entitled &quot;Early Morning / Mr. Sunshine&quot;), they moved to the more progressively inclined Harvest label. The name of the band, according to The International Barclay James Harvest Fan Club, signifies nothing specifically. Having exhausted other possibilities, each of the band members wrote single words on pieces of paper which were drawn out of a hat one by one. All were rejected until only three were left: James, a man who used to sing with the band, Harvest because they were living in a farmhouse, and Barclay after Barclays bank, because they aspired to make money. These were then rearranged to get the best-sounding name of Barclay James Harvest.

Their self-titled debut album featured backing by an orchestra organized by Robert John Godfrey. It was released in mid-1970 and was heavily touted by the musicians and the record label as the next big thing in orchestral rock, but met with overwhelmingly negative reviews and weak sales. Their second album, &quot;Once Again&quot;, was followed by a tour with a full orchestra under Godfrey&#x27;s guidance. Godfrey departed over writing issues behind &quot;Mocking Bird&quot; – one of the group&#x27;s most consistently popular tracks - so Martyn Ford was brought in to supervise the orchestral work for their third album, &quot;Barclay James Harvest and Other Short Stories&quot;. Years later Godfrey filed a lawsuit alleging he was owed composing credits and corresponding royalties on several of Barclay James Harvest&#x27;s songs. By the release of their fourth album, &quot;Baby James Harvest&quot;, in 1972, the pressures of touring were beginning to affect the band.

After this album, they departed from EMI, moved management to Harvey Lisberg, and signed to Polydor; the move immediately resulted in greater sales. The next album, &quot;Everyone Is Everybody Else&quot; (1974) was voted 13th by listeners in Radio Caroline&#x27;s 1977 Top 100 All Time Albums Chart. The band did a BBC Radio 1 session in 1974 for John Peel; Alan Freeman, however, would be the band&#x27;s main champion on the station in the 1970s and again when he returned from 1989 to 1993. The double live album, &quot;Barclay James Harvest Live&quot;, which followed in late 1974, was the first to chart in the UK, reaching No. 40. &quot;Time Honoured Ghosts&quot; (1975), which has &quot;Titles&quot;, recorded in the US, followed, and this too charted in the UK, reaching No. 32. &quot;Octoberon&quot; followed in 1976 and reached number 19 in the UK. They broke into the mainstream mainland European market with their 1977 set &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, which contained the song &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Moody Blues&quot;, a homage to the Moody Blues&#x27; song, &quot;Nights in White Satin.&quot;

Wolstenholme – whose mellotron playing was a trademark of the band&#x27;s sound in the 1970s – left in 1979 after the album &quot;XII&quot; (1978), as he began to suffer from clinical depression. He pursued a short solo career fronting the band Maestoso, before retiring from the music industry to farm. He remained inactive throughout the &#x27;80s before rejoining John Lees when BJH essentially split in two.

The remaining three members continued. In August 1980, they played a free concert in front of the Reichstag in West Berlin, with an estimated attendance of 250,000 people. They were the first Western rock band to perform in an open-air concert in East Germany (over two years before the Berlin Wall fell), playing in Treptower Park, East Berlin on 14 July 1987 to a 170,000-plus audience. The band continued as a trio with regular guest-musicians until 1998. One album, &quot;Welcome to the Show&quot;, produced in 1990, was released under the abbreviated name BJH; however, because of criticism from fans, the full name was restored, albeit with the inclusion of the BJH moniker.

In 1998, musical differences amongst members of BJH saw the band essentially split into two different groups, each of which retained &quot;Barclay James Harvest&quot; as part of its name. John Lees released an album mixing new songs and classics of the band, entitled &quot;Nexus&quot;, under the name &quot;Barclay James Harvest Through the Eyes of John Lees&quot;. Woolly Wolstenholme played in (and composed for) this band, subsequently resurrecting Maestoso to record and tour with new material, as well as back-catalogue favourites. Les Holroyd and Mel Pritchard teamed up to record under the name &quot;Barclay James Harvest featuring Les Holroyd&quot;. In 2006/7, Lees and Wolstenholme toured under the slightly modified band title &quot;John Lees&#x27; Barclay James Harvest&quot;.

Mel Pritchard died suddenly of a heart attack in early 2004. Woolly Wolstenholme took his own life in December 2010, having apparently struggled with depression for many years. The two derivatives of Barclay James Harvest continue to record and tour to this day, and enjoy ongoing popularity, particularly in Germany, France, and Switzerland.

==John Lees&#x27; Barclay James Harvest (1998-2023)==

This derivative of Barclay James Harvest features John Lees, bassist Craig Fletcher, drummer Kevin Whitehead and keyboard player Jez Smith. The band originally featured &quot;Woolly&quot; Stuart Wolstenholme on keyboards before his death in December 2010. The group formed in 1999 to record the album &quot;Nexus&quot;. Craig Fletcher and Kevin Whitehead were from Wolstenholme&#x27;s band &quot;Maestoso&quot;, and John and Woolly were members of the original Barclay James Harvest. The band toured in the UK and Europe in 2006, and recorded the live album &quot;Legacy&quot; at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in London. Since then, the band has played at venues in the UK, but more so in the rest of Europe, where they achieve good success. The band toured again around the UK in 2009. They played at the Berlin Wall anniversary festival at the Brandenburg Gate, Bad Homburg in Germany with JLBJH&#x27;s best attendance of 17,500 people, and more recently in Porto, Portugal with an attendance of 5,000. The band recently visited America, and played in Philadelphia. John Lees&#x27; Barclay James Harvest is currently signed and managed by Esoteric Recordings. Mark Powell, founder of the label, works as the band manager.

In October 2013, JLBJH released &quot;North&quot;, a studio album of all-new material, recorded at John&#x27;s own Friamere Studios, on limited edition vinyl, CD and deluxe CD with a bonus disc recorded live at the Buxton Opera House. &quot;North&quot; was very well received, going on to become Cherry Red&#x27;s biggest selling album of the fourth quarter of 2013. The band played nine gigs on a UK tour to promote the album, followed by a live radio concert for Christmas on German station SWR1. On 11 December 2022, John Lees announced on his website that his band would not tour after the 2023 gigs. The band also formerly featured Jeff Leach and Mike Bramwell as guest musicians.

==Barclay James Harvest featuring Les Holroyd (since 2002)==

In 2001, Les Holroyd and Mel Pritchard returned to the studio to record the album &#x27;Revolution Days&#x27; along with former Sad Cafe members Ian Wilson and Michael Byron-Hehir, as well as Steve Butler, Steve Pigott (Cher, Mike and the Mechanics), and Rabbit Bundrick (The Who). &#x27;Revolution Days&#x27; was released in 2002, and a touring band was put together with Holroyd and Pritchard; Michael Byron-Hehir on lead guitar and vocals; Ian Wilson on guitar and vocals; Steve Butler on keyboards, percussion, and vocals; Chris Jago on drums; and former BJH sideman Colin Browne on keyboards and vocals. The first show was at the Colmar Wine Festival in August 2002. In October and November of that year, they undertook their first European Tour. More tours and festivals followed in 2003. In January 2004, the band performed at the &#x27;Art on Ice&#x27; spectacular at the Zurich Hallenstadion with Roger Hodgson, John Helliwell and Bob Siebenberg of Supertramp, Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues and Jeremy Spencer of Fleetwood Mac. Upon returning to the UK, Mel Pritchard died from a suspected heart attack.

In January 2005, BJHFLH toured with Asia featuring John Payne as support, returning the favour on four UK shows in March of the same year. In 2006, they undertook the Classic Meets Rock Symphonic Barclay Tour with the 25-piece Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. In July 2007, they toured the UK. Les Holroyd and Michael Byron-Hehir also worked on Alan Simon&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur II&quot; 
album, Les joining the stage show in 2010. Les also performed in the live show of Simon&#x27;s &quot;Anne de Bretagne&quot;.
In 2011, Les joined the Rock Meets Classic Tour along with Ian Gillan, Lou Gramm, Dan McCafferty with The Bohemian Symphony Orchestra, performing four BJH songs: &quot;Hymn&quot;, &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Ring Of Changes&quot;, and &quot;Life Is For Living&quot;. Still touring Europe, the band introduced an acoustic spot into the set, showcasing their vocal harmonies with old favourites like &quot;Poor Boy Blues&quot;, &quot;Friend of Mine&quot;, and &quot;Crazy City&quot;. They recorded their 2012 winter tour.

==External works==
The band released a single &quot;Breathless&quot;/&quot;When the City Sleeps&quot; under the pseudonym of &quot;Bombadil&quot; in 1972. &quot;Breathless&quot;, an instrumental, was credited to &quot;Terry Bull&quot; (actually John Lees). The B side &quot;When the City Sleeps&quot; was credited to &quot;Lester Forest&quot; (actually Woolly Wolstenholme), who also played every instrument and sang. This obscure track made an appearance on the soundtrack of the 2007 series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, although it was not featured on the CD release.

<doc id="854617" wikidata="Q754323" url="?curid=854617" title="Fates Warning">
<text>Fates Warning is an American progressive metal band, formed in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1982 by vocalist John Arch, guitarists Jim Matheos and Victor Arduini, bassist Joe DiBiase, and drummer Steve Zimmerman. There have been numerous lineup changes over the course of their -year career, and Matheos is the only constant member. As of 2020, the band consists of Matheos, vocalist Ray Alder (who replaced Arch in 1987), bassist Joey Vera (who replaced DiBiase in 1996), drummer Bobby Jarzombek and guitarist Michael Abdow. Fates Warning also had a revolving cast of drummers and guitarists by the time Jarzombek and Abdow joined the band in 2007 and 2020 respectively.

A pioneer of the progressive metal movement, Fates Warning has been referred to as one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; of the genre, creating and popularizing the style along with Queensrÿche and Dream Theater. Their early work, influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal, is also important in the development of American power metal. Fates Warning has released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS cassette, three DVDs (each featuring live concerts) and four demo tapes. The band experienced its first commercial success with the 1986 release of their third studio album, &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot;, which peaked at No. 191 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became the first album released on Metal Blade to enter that chart. Their next three albums — &quot;No Exit&quot; (1988), &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; (1989) and &quot;Parallels&quot; (1991) — were also successful; the first two peaked at No. 111 and No. 141 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively. By 2001, Fates Warning had sold over a million albums worldwide. Their latest studio album, &quot;Long Day Good Night&quot;, was released on November 6, 2020.

==History==

===Early career and first three albums (1982–1986)===
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Night on Bröcken&quot;, was released in 1984 on the Metal Blade label. The album was mainly influenced by Iron Maiden and other heavy metal bands, in songs like the title track and &quot;Damnation&quot; in particular. There were progressive aspects that would be further developed in subsequent albums. &quot;The Spectre Within&quot; (1985) featured a more progressive approach with songs like &quot;The Apparition&quot;, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Underground&quot; and &quot;Traveler in Time&quot;, with many tempo changes, a greater complexity in the arrangements, and fantasy lyrics full of symbolism and double meaning. During this period, Fates Warning had become a live staple in the East Coast and Midwest areas of the US, sharing the stage with numerous bands like Motörhead, Queensrÿche, Anthrax, Overkill, Anvil and Armored Saint.

In 1986, original guitarist Victor Arduini was dismissed from the band and was replaced by Frank Aresti, and the third Fates Warning album, &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot;, was released in November of that year. It has been regarded as a groundbreaking and essential progressive metal release, working towards creating a more mythical atmosphere and a more fully realized progressive approach in song form; with complex and unusual riffs, and numerous tempo changes amidst frenetic and evocative vocal lines, however maintaining a basic fluidity. &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot; also made history by becoming the first album released on Metal Blade to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and saw Fates Warning sharing the stage with bands like Queensrÿche and Saxon.

===Lineup changes and rise to near fame (1987–1993)===
In 1987, original vocalist John Arch was dismissed from the band prior to the start of work on their next album, and was replaced by Ray Alder. Their first album with Alder, &quot;No Exit&quot; was released in March 1988 and further developed the direction taken by the prior album with a more powerful sound all the while setting aside the fantasy themes and atmospheres. It featured one of the first prog metal suite of the genre, &quot;The Ivory Gate of Dreams,&quot; which is based on the gates of horn and ivory. &quot;No Exit&quot; gave Fates Warning their highest chart position to date on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, entering at number 111 and staying on the chart for thirteen weeks; it also helped build the band&#x27;s popularity worldwide, with the videos for &quot;Anarchy Divine&quot; and &quot;Silent Cries&quot; receiving considerable airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, and Fates Warning touring almost non-stop in support of the album, playing with bands like Krokus, Savatage, Armored Saint and Flotsam and Jetsam.

Following the tour in support of &quot;No Exit&quot;, original drummer Steve Zimmerman left the band in 1988 and was replaced by Mark Zonder, just as Fates Warning was preparing for their fifth studio album. The resulting album, &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot;, was released in August 1989. The album abandoned the aggressive sound of &quot;No Exit&quot;, in favor of a more melodic and experimental one along with a melancholic atmosphere and intimate lyrics. &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; was full of extremely complex arrangements and an unusual and very articulated rhythm section, and is often regarded as a seminal prog metal album, &quot;which laid the foundations of the sound of the 90s&quot;. Kevin Moore (keyboardist for Dream Theater at the time) was featured as a guest on the song &quot;At Fate&#x27;s Hands&quot;, while the cover was designed by Hugh Syme, famous for his work with the Canadian progressive rock band Rush. Although &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; was not as successful as &quot;No Exit&quot;, the album nonetheless charted for nine weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while its only music video &quot;Through Different Eyes&quot; managed to get some airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The album also saw the band embark on their first full-length world tour, which lasted for a year between November 1989 and November 1990; they opened for Manowar in Europe and toured there again with Sanctuary, who had also opened for Fates Warning in the US in early 1990.

1991 saw the release of &quot;Parallels&quot;, distributed by Warner. The album, which started the collaboration with Rush producer Terry Brown, contains more accessible and streamlined songs than in the past, except for tracks such as &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; and &quot;Life in Still Water&quot;, which features guest vocals by James LaBrie (who had just joined Dream Theater). &quot;Parallels&quot; is considered by some an essential album that &quot;has influenced a great amount of subsequent musicians&quot; and is possibly the band&#x27;s most commercially successful record, despite the fact that it did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart like the previous three albums did and was released during the grunge breakout; it did, however, chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart and reach the top 10 on the Heatseekers chart. With &quot;Parallels&quot;, Fates Warning&#x27;s popularity was still dominant in the US and Europe, with the videos for &quot;Point of View&quot; and &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; receiving heavy rotation on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, and the band going on high-profile tours with the likes of Pantera and Savatage during 1992 as well as headlining the second night of the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany in 1993.

Current and former members of Fates Warning (namely Matheos and DiBiase) have claimed “Parallels” to be amongst if not their favorite in the Fates Warning catalog.

===Later years (1994–2009)===
Slowing down after the commercial success of previous releases, the follow-up to &quot;Parallels&quot; took two and a half years for Fates Warning to make. The resulting album, &quot;Inside Out&quot; (1994), continued in the general vein of the previous album while adding more melody to their songs. The band&#x27;s lineup also remained intact between albums for the first time since &quot;Spectre Within&quot;. Band members have attributed the album&#x27;s comparative lack of success to confusion while writing this album in the wake of the success of &quot;Parallels&quot; and their subsequent failure to maintain creative momentum. Just like &quot;Parallels&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot; entered the Top 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart in spite of little or no airplay due to the increasing popularity of grunge and alternative, and following its release, the band opened for Dream Theater in the U.S. and Europe on their &quot;Awake&quot; tour. A compilation album, &quot;Chasing Time&quot;, was released in 1995 and included two previously unreleased songs.

In 1996, both Joe DiBiase and Frank Aresti left the group. The three remaining members, Alder, Matheos and Zonder, joined by new member Joey Vera on bass and Kevin Moore as a guest keyboardist, released &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; the following year. Written as a concept album, &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in writing style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded. A live two-CD set, &quot;Still Life&quot;, was released in 1998, containing &quot;A Pleasant Shade of Gray&quot; performed live in its entirety. Joey Vera (bass), Bernie Versailles (guitars) and Jason Keazer (keyboards) accompanied the group on this album. A Japanese version included a studio cover of the Scorpions&#x27; &quot;In Trance&quot;. The lineup for A Pleasant Shade of Gray consisting of Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Vera, and Moore, returned to record &quot;Disconnected&quot; in 2000. In 2003, Frank Aresti was asked to fill in on a tour with Dream Theater and Queensrÿche. He officially rejoined the band as a full-time member in 2005.

Their tenth studio release &quot;FWX&quot; was released in 2004. Drummer Mark Zonder stated it would be his last album with the band, as he wished to pursue other interests, and left in 2005. Although an official member again, Frank Aresti did not appear on the album because the writing had been completed and contracts had been signed already. &quot;Live in Athens&quot;, a concert DVD, was released in 2005; this DVD included guest drummer Nick D&#x27;Virgilio.

In the liner notes to the 2005 expanded edition of &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot;, Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy noted that &quot;very often fans and critics credit Dream Theater for creating a whole new genre of progressive metal music in the late &#x27;80s/early &#x27;90s, [...] but the truth is Fates Warning were doing it years before us.&quot;

The band provided the song &quot;Nothing Left to Say&quot; to the soundtrack to the 1991 movie &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot;. They have recorded songs for various tributes, including the tracks &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; on the Rush tribute album &quot;Working Man&quot;, &quot;Saints in Hell&quot; on the 1997 Judas Priest tribute album &quot;Legends of Metal&quot;, and &quot;Sign of the Southern Cross&quot; on the 2000 &quot;Holy Dio&quot; Ronnie James Dio tribute album. 

===Reunions with former members, &quot;Darkness in a Different Light&quot; and &quot;Theories of Flight&quot; (2010–2017)===
In 2010, Fates Warning played select dates with the &quot;Parallels&quot; lineup (Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Aresti and DiBiase) to celebrate the reissued, remastered and expanded edition of the classic album.

At the beginning of 2011, an announcement was made that Matheos and original vocalist John Arch had formed a band called Arch/Matheos. Their debut album was released in the autumn of that year, also featuring Joey Vera on bass guitar, Bobby Jarzombek on drums, and Frank Aresti on additional lead guitar.

After many delays, Fates Warning released its eleventh studio album &quot;Darkness in a Different Light&quot; on September 27, 2013. It was the band&#x27;s first album since 2004&#x27;s &quot;FWX&quot;.

To celebrate the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot; lineup (Arch, Matheos, Aresti, DiBiase and Zimmerman) reunited for a headlining appearance at the Keep It True festival in Germany on April 30, 2016. That lineup also headlined the Progpower USA Festival in Atlanta, Georgia on September 9, 2016. Both performances were recorded and filmed and later released on April 28, 2017, by Metal Blade Records as &quot;Awaken the Guardian Live&quot; on CD, double vinyl, DVD, and Blu-ray.

Fates Warning entered the studio in December 2015 to begin recording their twelfth studio album, which was planned for release in early 2016. The album, titled &quot;Theories of Flight&quot;, was released on July 1, 2016.

===Return to Metal Blade and &quot;Long Day Good Night&quot; (2018–2022)===
When asked in a June 2018 interview about the thirteenth Fates Warning album, frontman Ray Alder stated: &quot;Right now, we&#x27;re not in a writing mode. Everyone is kind of doing their own thing. I&#x27;m sure that will come out soon enough, of what everyone is doing. For the meantime, there are no plans to write another Fates Warning album — not in the near future, at least.&quot; Alder also commented on the band&#x27;s future, saying: &quot;Right now, there&#x27;s just no plans to go into the studio or write. But, people are working on different things and we&#x27;re working on another tour right now for South America, so that is still a little up in the air. It&#x27;s 90 percent sure, but we&#x27;ll see what happens with that. I can&#x27;t say anything until it&#x27;s confirmed.&quot;

On February 15, 2019, it was announced that Fates Warning had re-signed to Metal Blade Records, and planned to begin working on a new album, for a 2020 release, after their spring tour with Queensrÿche. In a December 2019 interview, bassist Joey Vera stated, &quot;Fates Warning is not quite done writing, but pretty close. I think that the Fates record is also gonna be recording probably around January, February. I&#x27;m still very involved in both of those bands, obviously. So, for sure, a new Armored Saint record and a new Fates Warning record is on the horizon in the next 18 months, for sure.&quot;

On May 13, 2020, Alder announced on his Instagram profile that &quot;the vocals for Fates Warning&#x27;s 13th album are done. 13 songs in 12 days.&quot; It was announced on August 25, 2020, that the album was titled &quot;Long Day Good Night&quot; and would be released on November 6, 2020, just two weeks after &quot;Punching the Sky&quot; by Vera&#x27;s other band Armored Saint.

===Possible fourteenth studio album and future of the band (2023–present)===
When commenting on the possibility of another album, Alder stated in a May 2023 interview with &quot;Rock Hard&quot; that Matheos has no interest in writing new material as Fates Warning, but did not rule out any future tours: &quot;That was basically his saying he doesn&#x27;t wanna write any more Fates Warning music. It doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t ever tour again. I would love to tour again, and Jim would as well; we&#x27;ve already discussed it. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting everyone together.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Prog&quot; magazine a few months later, Alder reiterated that Matheos does not want to write new material as Fates Warning, but added, &quot;That could change, I don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;d have to talk to him. It&#x27;s not to say there won&#x27;t be any more live shows. The band didn&#x27;t break up. It&#x27;s just that there won&#x27;t be any more new music. And I need an outlet; music has been my life for over thirty years.&quot; The members began discussing a 40th anniversary tour however.

<doc id="854619" wikidata="Q5348940" url="?curid=854619" title="Eight-string guitar">
<text>An eight-string guitar is a guitar with eight strings, or one more than the Russian guitar&#x27;s seven. Eight-string guitars are less common than six- and seven-string guitars, but they are used by a few classical, jazz, and metal guitarists. The eight-string guitar allows a wider tonal range, or non-standard tunings (such as major-thirds tuning), or both.

Various non-standard guitars were made in the 19th century, including eight-string guitars played by Italians Giulio Regondi and Luigi Legnani.

Eight-string electric guitars gained popularity among metal bands, largely inspired by Swedish progressive metal band Meshuggah (formed in 1987). Contemporary use outside of metal has picked up in the last decade, and owes much to Animals as Leaders and their stylistic eclecticism.

==Designs==

===Semi-acoustic guitar (hollow-body guitar)===
Seeking a guitar tuning that would facilitate jazz improvisation, Ralph Patt invented major-thirds tuning in 1963. Patt&#x27;s tuning is a regular tuning, in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, standard guitar tuning has one major-third amid four fourths.

Seven-string guitars are needed for major-thirds tuning to have the E-e&#x27; range of the standard tuning. Having an eight-string instrument allowed Patt&#x27;s guitar to have G (equivalently A) as its open note. Patt purchased six-string archtop hollow-body guitars that were then modified by luthiers to have wider necks, wider pickups, and eight strings. Patt&#x27;s Gibson ES-150 was modified by Vincent &quot;Jimmy&quot; DiSerio c. 1965. Luthier Saul Koll modified a sequence of guitars: a 1938 Gibson Cromwell, a Sears Silvertone, a c. 1922 Mango archtop, a 1951 Gibson L-50, and a 1932 Epiphone Broadway; for Koll&#x27;s modifications, custom pick-ups accommodated Patt&#x27;s wide necks and high G (equivalently A); custom pick-ups were manufactured by Seymour Duncan and by Bill Lawrence. Roy Connors, former member of the 1960s folk singing group, The Highwaymen, reconfigured a Martin O-28 six-string guitar to an eight-string of his own design and received a U.S. Patent on it (#3269247).

===Solid-body===
Solid-body eight string guitars are also used by many bands today. The construction of a solid-body eight-string guitar is comparable to that of seven- and six-string variants. The standard tuning (from low to high) is F, B, E, A, D, G, B, E. Many prefer to tune the F to a low E (E1), the same note as the lowest string on a four-string electric bass in standard tuning, and providing the guitar with a fuller sound by having three different E strings. This tuning is equivalent to tuning a six-string guitar to Drop D tuning.

Like the seven-string, the first mass-produced eight-string guitar was made by Ibanez guitars in Japan; the RG2228. 

===Scale length===
The main design issue faced with an eight-string guitar is tuning stability with the lower strings. This is due to the neck being constructed too short, bridge problems such as improper intonation, uneven spacing for floating bridges, or the use of wrong string gauges. Other problems associated with tuning stability rely on the proper setup of the guitar.

Extended range eight string guitars sometimes will have a multi-scale design where the bass strings will be longer than the treble strings (fanned fret design). This helps with proper intonation of the lower strings, improves string tension balance across the strings, improves harmonic overtones, overtone series, and improves inharmonicity. (See also inharmonicity in pianos). The bass strings on an 8 string typically require the saddle to be pulled back a bit more than the other strings to properly set the intonation. Some bridge designs accommodate this by offsetting back the 7th and 8th strings or providing a bit extra room for adjustment. Longer scale lengths require less offset for proper intonation.

Paul Galbraith began using an eight-string guitar in 1994 when, in collaboration with luthier David Rubio, they designed the Brahms guitar. Galbraith generally tunes AEADGBEA.
Egberto Gismonti (born 1947) is a Brazilian guitarist and pianist who favors the 8-string classical guitar. Livio Gianola (Premana, 1964) is an Italian guitarist. It is considered by the specialized critic &quot;The Master of the Eight String Guitar&quot;.

===Jazz===
Hungarian born Australian Jazz guitarist Laszlo Sirsom plays 8-string jazz guitar made by Phil Carson Crickmore He&#x27;s tuning as a normal guitar on the middle plus High A and lower B. Charlie Hunter plays an eight-string guitar made by Ralph Novak of Novax Guitars. Five of the strings are tuned to the standard guitar&#x27;s upper five (A, D, G, B, E), while three of the strings are tuned to the standard bass guitar&#x27;s three lowest (E, A, D). The bass and treble sections have separate pickups and are sent to separate amplifiers. Hunter also has a ten-string guitar based on the same principle—a combination of standard six-string guitar and standard four-string bass.

===Metal===
The eight-string guitar is used by modern heavy metal guitarists such as Fredrik Thordendal and Mårten Hagström of Meshuggah, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Stephen Carpenter of Deftones, Greg Burgess of Allegaeon, Simon Girard and Kevin Chartré of Beyond Creation, Justin Lowe and Trent Hafdahl of After the Burial, Josh Travis of Emmure (ex-The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza and ex-Glass Cloud), Per Nilsson of Scar Symmetry and Meshuggah as a touring member and others. The instrument is particularly associated with the “djent” sound popularized by Meshuggah, Vildhjarta, and Periphery, among others.

Tosin Abasi and Javier Reyes of Animals as Leaders primarily use a drop-E tuning (where the lowest string matches the E1 on a standard-tuned bass guitar) and incorporate &quot;thumping,&quot; an adaptation of different bass guitar techniques — the term blankets all sorts of possible note groupings, but primary influences include a style á la funk bassist Larry Graham and Victor Wooten&#x27;s double thumping technique — as well as harp-like arpeggios extending across the full range of the instrument.

Ihsahn of the black metal band Emperor began playing seven-string guitar in 1999 and first played eight-string guitar on his 2010 album &quot;After&quot;.

Rusty Cooley tunes his eight-string guitar like a standard six-string expanded in both directions. This tuning offers both deeper bass tones than a conventional guitar and extended range in the higher register for lead melodies.

Guitarist Justin Broadrick of the English industrial metal band Godflesh introduced his eight-string playing on the 2014 Godflesh EP &quot;Decline &amp; Fall&quot;.

Guitarists Lucas Mann and Joel Omans from the technical deathcore band Rings of Saturn also use eight-string guitars, with Mann primarily making use of a nine-string guitar for the band&#x27;s 2019 album Gidim. Miles Dimitri Baker, one of their former members, also used one.

Chris Andrews of the death metal band Devourment uses eight-string guitars, starting with the album &quot;Obscene Majesty&quot;.

John Petrucci of progressive metal band Dream Theater plays an eight-string guitar on the song &quot;Awaken the Master&quot;, from Dream Theater&#x27;s 2021 album &quot;A View from the Top of the World&quot;.

<doc id="854621" wikidata="Q2580175" url="?curid=854621" title="Emmett Chapman">
<text>Emmett Chapman (September 28, 1936 – November 1, 2021) was an American jazz musician best known as the inventor of the Chapman Stick and maker of the Chapman Stick family of instruments.

==Career==
Chapman started his career as a guitarist, recording and performing in the late 1960s. He played with Barney Kessel and Tim Buckley before leading his own band.

In 1969, Chapman modified his homemade nine-string &quot;Freedom Guitar&quot; to accommodate his &quot;Free Hands&quot; tapping method. Although some guitarists had done two-handed tapping with the fingers of the right hand parallel to the strings, Chapman&#x27;s method used the fingers of both hands perpendicular to the strings. This culminated in the creation of the Electric Stick, which he renamed the Chapman Stick. He founded Stick Enterprises in 1974 and has made more than 6,000 instruments. He held fourteen patents for various aspects of the Chapman Stick. During the 1970s, Chapman toured extensively to promote his music and the instrument.

He was influenced by Barney Kessel, then John McLaughlin.

In 1985, he released a solo album, &quot;Parallel Galaxy&quot;. The song &quot;Back Yard&quot; was used in the 1984 version of the film &quot;Dune&quot;. An aesthetically modified Chapman Stick was used as the baliset musical instrument, described in the novel, and is performed by Patrick Stewart in the director&#x27;s cut of the film.

Chapman died at his home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, on November 1, 2021, at the age of 85, after a long battle with cancer.

<text>Southern Adventist University is a private Seventh-day Adventist university in Collegedale, Tennessee. It is owned and operated by the Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. It was founded in 1892 in Graysville, Tennessee, as Graysville Academy and was the first Adventist school in the southern U.S. Due to the need for additional space for expansion the school relocated in 1916 and was renamed Southern Junior College. In 1944, Southern began awarding baccalaureate degrees and was renamed Southern Missionary College. In 1996 the institution started conferring master&#x27;s degrees and adopted its current name.

Southern offers associate, baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees. The university and its programs are accredited by multiple organizations including the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Its Institute of Archaeology offers an undergraduate degree in biblical archaeology; Southern is one of only two schools which offer the degree. It is known for its emphasis on Adventist beliefs and conservative religious and social practices, and is considered the most conservative of the Seventh-day Adventist schools in North America. The college operates a radio station (WSMC-FM), a health food store and a wellness center. Enrollment was 3,053 students in 2010, its highest level to date.

==History==
Southern&#x27;s roots stem from the establishment of Graysville Academy in Graysville, Tennessee, in 1892, in a part of the South much affected by the American Civil War. The area saw the battle of Chickamauga and the Chattanooga campaign, and was the staging ground for Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta campaign. The academy was privately funded at first, with no financial support from the Adventist church. In 1897 it was renamed the Southern Industrial School and then Southern Training School in 1901. The school moved to the community of Thatcher&#x27;s Switch in 1916, renaming it Collegedale. In 1943, Kenneth A. Wright became president of the school. During Wright&#x27;s administration, Southern Junior College became accredited as a four-year college. A new name, Southern Missionary College, was adopted in 1944, and Southern granted its first baccalaureate degrees two years later. When the school became a university in 1996, the trustees voted on a new name: Southern Adventist University.

===Graysville Academy, 1892–1897===

The Graysville Seventh-day Adventist Church was organized on September 8, 1888, and by the fall of 1890, the members had dedicated a church building. R.M. Kilgore, former president of the Illinois Conference had been asked to supervise the church&#x27;s work in the Southern United States. He had just moved to Graysville and was present for the church dedication. As the superintendent for the church&#x27;s work in the South, Kilgore repeatedly advocated the establishment of a school.

Kilgore invited George W. Colcord (1843–1902), to come to Graysville and establish a school. Colcord was the founder of Milton Academy, which is the forerunner of Walla Walla University. The General Conference Education Secretary, W. W. Prescott, along with Kilgore and Colcord worked together to establish the school at Graysville. Colcord and his wife Ada began the school. The first term began in February, 1892, with 23 students. The second term began in September of that year. By January 1893 Colcord reported that 62 students were in attendance. By 1893 there were three full-time teachers and three part-time teachers. Prescott considered the positive attitude of the school&#x27;s faculty, students and supporters to be indicators of the school&#x27;s future success and good reason to start other such schools in the South.

During 1892, Colcord operated the school privately. Then, at the session of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference held at Battle Creek, Michigan, February 17 to March 6, 1893, the church officially took over the school. This first school in the South inspired the session to recommend that other schools also be established.

In the Fall of 1894, Graysville Academy faced a crisis. Fourteen of the members of the Graysville Church were indicted for having violated the Tennessee Sunday law. This included Colcord, his nephew, I. C. Colcord, and M. C. Sturdevant, manager of the boys&#x27; dormitory.

The church members found guilty refused to pay the fines, choosing to go to prison instead. The imprisonment of the school&#x27;s leaders resulted in its immediate closing for the rest of the year. The students, some of whom were ready to graduate, returned to their homes.

===Southern Industrial School, 1897–1901===
In November 1897, the district conference voted to change the school&#x27;s name to Southern Industrial School. The name change reflected a change in the school&#x27;s emphasis. Industries were established including a wagon and blacksmith shop, a broom shop, a printshop and a school farm. The farm grew peaches, pears and many types of berries and vegetables.
===Southern Training School, 1901–1916===
The Southern Union Conference was organized in April 1901. Kilgore, the superintendent of the Southern District, known as District 2, was elected the first president of the Southern Union Conference. The headquarters was in Graysville. The General Conference arranged for the Southern Union to take over the operation of the Southern Industrial School. The property was transferred to the Southern Union. They renamed the school the Southern Training School. It offered 14 grades of instruction.

===Southern Junior College, 1916–1945===
====Relocation====

Eventually the Graysville school outgrew its site. Church leaders looked for a larger plot of land. They believed &quot;that the only education worth while in these strenuous days is that practical kind which teaches the student to actually do with his hand the things he learns about in books.&quot; To provide for this practical concern, they found a larger property. Plans were made to relocate the college program to a farm at Thatcher&#x27;s Switch east of Chattanooga. The move from Graysville to Thatcher&#x27;s Switch involved moving most of the school&#x27;s equipment, livestock, and implements to the new site fifty miles away. The school moved and opened in its new location by October, 1916. The community was soon renamed Collegedale and the school as Southern Junior College. The term training school had become associated with reform schools while at the same time the junior college designation had become a popular one.

Graysville Academy continued on at the original site as a church and conference-sponsored secondary boarding academy until 1938.

====Pioneer years====
In 1916, the school&#x27;s property holdings totaled $32,000. Two years later, due mainly to the construction of additional buildings on campus, the school&#x27;s holdings increased to $113,000. Many students earned their tuition by helping to construct these buildings. Southern was financially supported by two union conferences of the Church&#x27;s North American administration. The school organized construction bees. Interested church members came from across the South to help in these bees.

At first, the school taught only students in grades 1–12 with a total enrollment of 59 students. In 1918, three students were taking post-high school level classes. The total student enrollment at this time was 175.

Southern Junior College served two union conferences of Seventh-day Adventists, the Southern and the Southeastern. Later these two would be reorganized into one, the Southern Union Conference. In 1920, Lynn H. Wood, the president of the college, presented a major report to meetings for both union conferences. He reviewed the events of the first four years at the Ooltewah location.

According to Wood, enrollment grew quickly because of a tuition work program. Students of limited means realized they could get an education and improve themselves. This put a strain on housing. But the desire for an education motivated the students to cope with those early inadequate facilities, &quot;Students have been willing to live in shacks and tents, to put up with all kinds of inconvenience, in order that they might receive the character development that the school had for them.&quot; Wood referred to these first few years as the &quot;pioneer years.&quot; He wrote that the positive spiritual attitude of the students made these years the most enjoyable that one could wish for.

The college built the girls&#x27; dormitory first. The girls moved in before it was finished, even before there was any heating, doors or chairs. They used &quot;curtains for doors, sat upon their trunks for chairs — any way to get along.&quot;

====Faith community support====
The building of the boys&#x27; dormitory began in the summer of 1918. The students helped build it, and, in doing so, many earned their way through school. Shortly after the beginning of the school year in 1918, a &quot;Workers&#x27; Bee&quot; took place. Church workers from all across the South and from church headquarters in Washington, D.C. came to the college to build the boys&#x27; dormitory. For two and a half weeks they worked and associated with the students. They succeeded in putting up most of the framework.

Other help from the Adventist faith community included a $6,000 donation by the Southern Publishing Association for a water supply system and another &quot;Working Bee&quot; to build a large dairy barn, a blacksmith shop, and a corn crib. People interested in the college&#x27;s success bought surrounding properties and donated them to the institution, more than doubling the school&#x27;s area to close to . This allowed the school to protect itself from families moving so close that they hindered their young people attending from learning some independence, President Wood wrote. He encouraged families to send their young people to the school, and if the cost was too high for some of them, he advised that church leaders make sure they got the help they needed for their young people to attend and live in the dormitory.

===Southern Missionary College, 1944–1982===
In 1944, the Seventh Day Adventist General Conference Spring Council voted for Southern to become a four-year college. The enrollment that first year was the highest ever to date, 436 students. The theology, teaching and pre-nursing departments had the highest enrollments. Industries that helped students earn their tuition included a wood shop, a broom factory, a printing press, and a farm. The name Southern Missionary College was chosen at a combined meeting of the members of the college board, the union educational board, and the college faculty.

===Southern College of Seventh-day Adventists, 1982–1996===
On July 1, 1982, the word &quot;Missionary&quot; was dropped from the school&#x27;s name. The reported reasons for the change were that the general population reacted negatively to the term; foreign countries resisted accepting church workers who were from a &quot;missionary&quot; college; the name incorrectly identified the school as only a Bible college, rather than a fully accredited, four-year liberal arts institution; and, graduates found the name &quot;missionary&quot; made it more difficult for them to get a job. Southern was the last Adventist college in North America to retain &quot;missionary&quot; in its title. The others changed their names many years earlier.

In their official announcement of the name change, the Board of Trustees of Southern Missionary College explained that a shorter name would help popularize it. They also stated that, &quot;The word &#x27;Southern&#x27; has been associated with the College since its beginning—Southern Industrial School, Southern Training School, Southern Junior College, Southern Missionary College, and now Southern College.&quot;

===Early 1980s controversy===
Southern College found itself drawn into a wider church controversies involving Desmond Ford who was dismissed from ministry in the Adventist church in 1980, and Walter Rae, and Ronald Numbers&#x27; book, &quot;The Prophetess of Health&quot;. It began after a visit to the campus by a leading Bible scholar and theologian of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Edward Heppenstall, on his understanding of the church&#x27;s &quot;investigative judgment&quot; teaching, and who was also mentor to Desmond Ford. Then grew when a teacher from the theology department made a comment that seemed to disagree with statements made by church pioneer Ellen G. White. The incident along with other concerns led to accusations that faculty at the school did not believe in White as a prophet and led to calls for their dismissal. Southern President Frank Knittel and Board of Trustees member Tom Zwemer resigned, and Jerry Gladson, a professor of Old Testament Studies at Southern, also left the school. His credentials as a minister of the church were not renewed.

===Southern Adventist University, 1996–present===
In May 1996, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted approval for Southern to become an accredited Level III institution, allowing the school to confer master&#x27;s degrees. By September of that year, the college&#x27;s constituency approved the name change to Southern Adventist University. In 1996, attendance was 1600. Since 1996, Southern has continued to grow and build, reaching a peak enrollment of 3,053 in 2010 (compared with 2,079 in 1980).
==Academics==
The student-faculty ratio at Southern Adventist University is 16:1 and its most selected majors are biological and biomedical sciences; business, management, marketing, and related support services; education; and health professions and related clinical sciences. Southern offers 81 undergraduate degrees, with sixty majors, thirty-eight minors and two one-year certificate programs. It also offers master&#x27;s degrees in business, computer science, education, psychology, nursing, religion and social work. The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Accrediting Association of Seventh-day Adventist Schools, Colleges, and Universities. In 2009, the &quot;Princeton Review&quot;, an education services company, selected Southern as one of 141 institutions it listed in its &quot;Best in the Southeast&quot; section.

===School of Nursing===
The nursing program was instituted in 1934. Upon completion of the program students were able to transfer to Florida Sanitarium and Hospital, where they could earn a diploma in nursing. In 1963, Southern&#x27;s President Rees announced that the school&#x27;s nursing program had received its Bachelor of Science National League of Nursing accreditation. In 2002, the master&#x27;s program also received official accreditation. Southern&#x27;s School of Nursing has existed on the Collegedale campus since 1956.

In 2003, the school announced an accelerated program allowing registered nurses with an associate&#x27;s degree to receive a Master of Science in Nursing. At this date approximately half of Southern&#x27;s nursing graduate program were non-Adventist.

In December 2010, the college temporarily suspended a home health nursing program after two of its nursing students were accosted at gunpoint in Chattanooga. The school is considering a safer, more controlled environment for the program.

In 2011, the university opened Florida Hospital Hall, a new building with twice the space of the former nursing building, to accommodate an expanding student base.

===Institute of Archaeology===
The Institute of Archaeology is part of the School of Religion. It coordinates the archaeological programs at Southern through an undergraduate degree, an archeological museum, the William G. Dever Research Library and its archaeological excavations and publications. Southern is one of two schools in the U.S. where students can pursue an undergraduate degree in biblical archaeology. The Lynn H. Wood Archaeological Museum has a collection of nearly 600 artifacts, many of which were unearthed in Palestine between 1967 and 1975.

The current Institute Director, Professor of Near Eastern Studies and Archaeology Michael Hasel, studied for his doctorate under William G. Dever at the University of Arizona. In 2000, Dever gave his artifact collection in loan to Hasel and Southern. This made the development of Southern&#x27;s program possible. The artifacts, valued at $250,000, date from 3200 BC to 450 AD. The collection has an almost complete set of the many strains of pottery from this period which students can study. In 2008, Dever placed his personal library at Southern, along with 15,000 photographic slides of archaeological excavations.

===School of Visual Art and Design===
Wayne and Maria Hazen founded the School of Visual Art and Design in 1998. The film department produced &quot;Angel in Chains&quot; in 2003, a film &quot;based on a true story about acceptance and forgiveness.&quot; In 2007, Southern released &quot;Secret of the Cave&quot;, a feature film which was awarded a Crystal Heart Award at the Heartland Film Festival in Indiana. The family-oriented feature was filmed in Ireland and was the first feature-length film produced at the university. The school offers degrees in graphic design, animation, film production and fine art.

===McKee Library===

The McKee Library is located on the campus and opened in 1970. Its collection of books and media comprises approximately 165,000 volumes on the shelves, 25,000 electronic books, subscriptions to more than 880 print and electronic periodicals and access to more than 19,000 electronic journals. The library is defined by the Thomas Memorial Collection, a major Civil War collection with more than 3,600 volumes concerning Lincoln and the Civil War, and authentic photos and newspapers. The Collection has two original copies of the only Lincoln biography ever read and approved by him, the &quot;Life of Abraham Lincoln&quot; by J. L. Scripps, and a section of his original marble sarcophagus.

==Ideology==
Southern is known for its religious and social conservatism, and it is widely regarded as the most conservative of denominationally owned Adventist colleges in North America. In 2001, Adventist noted theologian and scholar Raymond Cottrell, a &quot;progressive Adventist&quot;, wrote that Southern operated &quot;an agency of Southern Bible belt obscurantism.&quot;

In explaining why he placed his collection of artifacts and his personal library at Southern Adventist University, archaeologist William Dever said, &quot;The major support for archaeology work in Israel and Jordan comes from conservative and evangelical circles where the Bible is still taken seriously and no one is more serious and committed about archaeological study in the Middle East than Adventists.&quot;

==Student life==

The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; describes Southern as a &quot;religiously loving environment.&quot; Most forms of jewelry are not allowed on campus, other than engagement rings, and students may be fined for not complying with this policy. Southern is a dry campus, as the Adventist Church opposes the use of alcohol. The university observes the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and students are expected to refrain from secular activities during these hours.

Although Southern does not have fraternities or sororities, there are 40 clubs on campus, one of which is a chapter of the Adventist Forum, publisher of &quot;Spectrum Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Southern Accent&quot; is a weekly student-run newspaper that has been the voice of Southern students since 1926 and gives information on events and outings and &quot;hot issues that are being talked about on campus&quot;. There are 21 student-led ministries on campus and in the community and a Student Missions program.

Southern has more than of hiking/mountain biking trails used by students and local community members alike.

There is a campus-wide internet network with all classrooms accessing the wireless network and a computer lab in each building with access to printing. Wireless printing is also accessible in the dormitories.

===Dormitories===

Southern&#x27;s dormitories are single gender although students can opt out of the dormitories during summer sessions or with permission from a dean. Upperclass and married students can receive exemptions from this policy.
The men&#x27;s dormitory is Talge Hall and the women&#x27;s dormitory is Thatcher Hall. An accidental fire in Thatcher Hall in April 2005 killed one student and injured two others. The dormitories have also been used to shelter storm victims who needed short-term housing, such as after tornadoes in early 2011.

===WSMC-FM radio station===

Southern owns and operates FM radio station WSMC which is almost completely staffed by students and the only classical music station in the Chattanooga area. In 2003, following technical problems that caused the station to keep dropping off the air, WSMC upgraded equipment to improve its reliability. It has been in operation since 1961 and is located on campus.

==McKee Foods==
McKee Foods has its headquarters beside the campus and has been an important part of school history as one of the companies which have provided jobs within walking distance for students to fund their education. It was founded by a Southern alumnus and is the headquarters for Little Debbie, Sovex and Sunbelt products. McKee Foods is one of the largest employers in Hamilton County.

<text>Denis Auguste Marie Raffet (2 March 180416 February 1860) was a French illustrator and lithographer. He was a student of Nicolas Toussaint Charlet, and was a retrospective painter of the Empire.

==Biography==

Raffet was born in Paris.

At an early age he was apprenticed to a wood turner, but took up the study of art at evening classes. At the age of 18 he entered the workshop of Cabanel, where he applied his skill to the decoration of china, and where he met Rudor, from whom he received instruction in lithography, in the practice of which he was to rise to fame. He then entered the École des Beaux-Arts, but returned to lithography in 1830 when he produced on stone his famous designs of Lützen, Waterloo, &quot;Le bal&quot;, &quot;La revue&quot;, and &quot;Les adieux de la garrison&quot;, by which his reputation became immediately established.

Raffet&#x27;s chief works were his lithographs of the Napoleonic campaigns, from Egypt to Waterloo, vigorous designs inspired by ardent patriotic enthusiasm. In this endeavour he was a contemporary of other French artist-lithographers of Napoleon and the French army including Hippolyte Bellangé, Horace Vernet, and Nicolas Toussaint Charlet. As an illustrator his activity was prodigious, the list of works illustrated by his crayon amounting to about forty-five, among which are Béranger&#x27;s poems, the &quot;History of the Revolution&quot; by Adolphe Thiers, the &quot;History of Napoleon&quot; by de Norvins, the great &quot;Walter Scott&quot; by Auguste Defauconpret, the French Plutarch and Frédéric Bérat&#x27;s &quot;Songs&quot;.

He went to Rome in 1849, was present at the siege of Rome, which he made the subject of some lithographs, and followed the Italian campaign of 1859, of which he left a record in his &quot;Episodes de la campagne d&#x27;Italie de 1859&quot;. His portraits in pencil and water-colour are full of character. He died at Genoa in 1860. In 1893 a monument by Emmanuel Frémiet was unveiled in the Jardin de l&#x27;Infante at the Louvre, Paris. The statue was removed and melted down during the nazi occupation of Paris.

<doc id="854646" wikidata="Q7762279" url="?curid=854646" title="The Sash">
<text>&quot;The Sash&quot; (Roud 4796) also known as &quot;The Sash My Father Wore&quot;) is a ballad from Northern Ireland commemorating the victory of King William III in the Williamite War in Ireland in 1690–1691. The lyrics mention the 1689 Siege of Derry, the 1689 Battle of Newtownbutler near Enniskillen, the 1691 Battle of Aughrim, and the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. It is popular amongst Ulster loyalists and many other unionists in Northern Ireland, it also remains a popular folk ballad in parts of Ireland and Scotland .
The melody has been traced back to the early 19th century. The tune of &quot;The Sash&quot; was well-known around Europe, and before the lyrics were added, it was a love song that lamented the division between people. Instead of &quot;it was old and it was beautiful&quot;, the lyrics were &quot;she was young and she was beautiful&quot; and is in Broadside Ballads (1787), titled &quot;Irish Molly O&quot;. Another known printing of the tune is from 1876 including the words &quot;The Hat My Father Wore&quot;. The song is classified in the Roud Folk Song Index as number 4796. It has also been adapted by fans of Stockport County F.C., who call it &quot;The Scarf My Father Wore&quot; or simply &quot;The Anthem&quot;.

<doc id="854648" wikidata="Q3508682" url="?curid=854648" title="List of Hungarian Jews">
<text>This is a list of Hungarian Jews. There has been a Jewish presence in today&#x27;s Hungary since Roman times (bar a brief expulsion during the Black Death), long before the actual Hungarian nation. Jews fared particularly well under the Ottoman Empire, and after emancipation in 1867. At its height, the Jewish population of historical Hungary numbered more than 900,000, but the Holocaust and emigration, especially during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, has reduced that to around 100,000, most of whom live in Budapest and its suburbs.

This is a list of anyone who could be reliably described as &quot;Hungarian&quot; and is of significant Jewish heritage (ethnic or religious). See List of Hungarian Americans for descendants of Hungarian émigrés born in America, a significant number of whom are of Jewish ancestry.

The names are presented in the Western European convention of the given name preceding the family name, whereas in Hungary, the reverse is true, as in most Asian cultures.

<text>4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (4-HO-DiPT or Iprocin) is a synthetic psychedelic drug. It is a higher homologue of psilocin, 4-HO-DET, and is a positional isomer of 4-HO-DPT and has a tryptamine molecular sub-structure.

==Dosage==
4-HO-DiPT is orally active at around 3 mg and above, and its effects last for 2–3 hours. Higher doses such as those above 30 mgs can increase the duration of the effects significantly.

==Effects==
The effects of 4-HO-DiPT are broadly comparable to those of other serotonergic psychedelics such as LSD and psilocin, but they are distinguished by their relative brevity. Shulgin &quot;doubt[s] that there is another psychedelic drug, anywhere, that can match this one for speed, for intensity, for brevity, and sensitivity to dose, at least one that is active orally.&quot; An idiosyncratic effect of the drug, also noted by Shulgin, is its tendency to induce tremors.

Some users have reported a minor audio distortion with lower dosages. Higher dosages increase the polarity of the distortion. It is defined as being slightly lower in pitch and creating several different effects, such as pitch bend, volume distortion, and rate distortion. As with most DiPT psychedelics, music can become more dissonant and less harmonious. Users have also reported a visual distortion widely comparable to the hallucinogen LSD.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
==Clinical trials==
FT-104, a prodrug to 4-HO-DiPT, has entered double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia for the treatment of postpartum depression and treatment-resistant depression. 

==Legal status==
===Finland===
Scheduled in government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market.

===Germany===
Scheduled in New Psychoactive Substances Act (NpSG). Use of covered substances is permitted only for industrial and scientific purposes.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 4-HO-DiPT as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Mar 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as 4-hydroxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (4-HO-DIPT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

===United States===
4-HO-DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it is possible that it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.

====Florida====
&quot;4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine&quot; is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

<text>Peter Schreier (29 July 1935 – 25 December 2019) was a German tenor in opera, concert and lied, and a conductor. He was regarded as one of the leading lyric tenors of the 20th century.

Schreier was a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor conducted by Rudolf Mauersberger, performing as an alto soloist. He became a tenor, focused on concert and lieder singing, well known internationally for the Evangelist parts in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; and Passion. A member of the Berlin State Opera from 1963, he appeared in Mozart roles such as Belmonte in &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; and Tamino in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, and in the title role of Pfitzner&#x27;s &quot;Palestrina&quot;, among others. He appeared at the Vienna State Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, among others, as one of few singers from the German Democratic Republic to perform internationally.

Schreier made many recordings, especially of Bach&#x27;s works as both a singer and a conductor, even simultaneously. He recorded many lieder including the song cycles by Schubert and Schumann. He was known for intelligent understanding of texts and their musical expression with intensity. Schreier received awards including the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, Léonie Sonning Music Prize.

== Early life ==
Schreier was born in Meissen, Saxony, and grew up in the village of , near Meissen, where his father was a teacher, cantor and organist. In June 1945, when Schreier was almost ten years old, and just a few months after the destruction of Dresden, he entered the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor boys&#x27; choir. Its conductor Rudolf Mauersberger recognized his talent. He let him sing many solo alto parts and created compositions with his voice in mind. Solo recordings from the time (1948–1951) were reissued on compact disc.

Schreier was 16 years old when his voice broke, and he became a tenor, as he had passionately wished, because of the several Evangelists – all tenors – in J.S. Bach&#x27;s Passions and in his &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. After he had decided to become a professional singer he took voice lessons, privately from 1954 to 1956, then at the Musikhochschule Dresden, where he also studied conducting.

== Career ==
Peter Schreier made his professional debut at the Dresdner Staatsoper in 1957, as the First Prisoner in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;. His breakthrough came in 1962 as Belmonte in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, and he also appeared as Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. In 1963, he became a member of the Berlin State Opera. Starting in 1966, he was for many years an annual guest of the Vienna State Opera. That same year he made his debut at the Bayreuth Festival as the young seaman in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; with Karl Böhm as conductor. For 25 years, beginning in 1967, he took part in the program of the annual Salzburg Festival. In 1969, he starred as The Witch in Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, in a CD recording that featured the Staatskapelle Dresden. He performed more than 60 operatic roles. It was important to him to sing the title role of &quot;Palestrina&quot;, the opera by Hans Pfitzner, not only in Munich but also in East Berlin — a controversial issue at the time in East Germany.

Schreier was one of few singers from the German Democratic Republic to perform internationally, including at the Metropolitan Opera. He appeared regularly at the Vienna State Opera, where he sang 200 performances, beginning as Tamino in 1967, also as Belmonte, Don Ottavio in Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni, the title role of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, Flamand in &quot;Capriccio&quot; by Richard Strauss, Lenski in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugen Onegin&quot;, Count Almaviva in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; and Loge in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. His Wagner roles also included Mime in &quot;Siegfried&quot;.

He recorded Bach cantatas regularly with the Thomanerchor and the Gewandhaus Orchestra conducted by Erhard Mauersberger, with soloists including Adele Stolte, Annelies Burmeister and Theo Adam, such as the cantata for Pentecost &quot;Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!&quot; BWV 172, in 1970. He was the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot; in recordings conducted by both Rudolf and Erhard Mauersberger, Karl Richter, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan. He recorded Bach&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot; and &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; with Helmuth Rilling.

In June 2000, Schreier left the opera stage. His last role at the Berlin State Opera was Tamino; he argued that he could no longer pretend to be a young prince. He ended his singing career on 22 December 2005, combining the functions of Evangelist and conductor in a performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; in Prague. He kept singing lieder, a genre he had pursued throughout his career, including the song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.

From the early 1970s, Schreier was also a conductor with a special interest in the works of Mozart, Bach, and Haydn. He conducted orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic.

== Personal life ==
Schreier was married and lived in Dresden from 1945 until his death, in the district of Loschwitz. He died in Dresden on Christmas Day, 25 December 2019, after a long illness.
He was survived by his wife, Renate, and two sons, Torsten and Ralf.
The funeral service took place at the Kreuzkirche, Dresden on 8 January 2020.

== Evaluation ==
Schreier was an extremely intelligent singer, with sympathetic feeling for the text. 
Monika Grütters, Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, summarised after his death that he was one of the most impressive voices from Germany (&quot;), who represented Germany in the opera houses of the world as a nation of culture (&quot;), remembered as the Evangelist in Bach&#x27;s Passions, and having written music history in a career of four decades.

<text>Marian Albertovich Kowalski (; 15 August 1821 or 15 October 1821 – 28 May 1884 or 9 July 1884) was a Polish-Russian astronomer.

== Biography ==
He was born in Dobrzyń nad Wisłą (called Добжинь in Russian) in Congress Poland, Russian Empire. His patronymic is alternatively given as Voytekhovich or Voytsekhovich (Войтехович or Войцехович), which suggests his father&#x27;s name was Wojciech. Confusingly, a few Russian sources even give his name as Marian Albertovich Kovalsky-Voytekhovich, but this seems to be an error.

He graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1845. His PhD was in 1852 for his theory of the orbit of Neptune. Beginning in 1852 he was director of the Kazan Observatory, and dean of faculty of physics and mathematics in Kazan.

His most important work was on the analysis of the proper motion of 3,136 stars from James Bradley&#x27;s catalog, which was the first usable method to deduce the rotation of the Milky Way galaxy.
Based on this work, he disproved that a single massive central body in the center of our galaxy was responsible for the motion of the stars.

In celestial mechanics, he found improved methods to deduce a planetary orbit from observations, and analysed the mathematics of perturbations in planetary motions. In particular, he made a more accurate determination of Neptune&#x27;s orbit. He also found an improved method of determining the orbits of binary stars.

His important papers were published in 1859 in the book &quot;Recherches astronomiques de l&#x27;observatoire de Kasan&quot;.

He died in Kazan and is buried in the Catholic cemetery there . He was the father of Aleksandr Marianovich Kowalski, who worked at Pulkovo Observatory and who died on July 6, 1902, at the age of 44. 

== Legacy ==
The crater Koval&#x27;skiy on the Moon and the crater Koval&#x27;sky on Mars are both named in his honour.

<doc id="854657" wikidata="Q2580679" url="?curid=854657" title="William Strong (Pennsylvania jurist)">
<text>William Strong (May 6, 1808 – August 19, 1895) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1870 to 1880 writing majority opinions in landmark cases like &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot;. Strong previously served as a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania from 1847 to 1851 and as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from 1857 to 1868. He also served on the Commission that adjudicated the disputed presidential election of 1876.

==Early life==
Strong was born in Somers, Connecticut and later moved to Pennsylvania. He was the eldest of eleven children of William Lightbourn Strong, a descendant of Elder John Strong and Harriet (Deming) Strong. He was the brother of Newton Deming Strong and the cousin of U.S. Representative Theron Rudd Strong of New York. William Strong attended the Monson Academy in Massachusetts, and graduated from Yale University in 1828, where he was a member of Brothers in Unity and Phi Beta Kappa. He taught school in Burlington, New Jersey while studying law with Garret D. Wall, and then completed his legal education with a six-month course at Yale Law School. After being admitted to the bar Strong started a legal practice in Reading, Pennsylvania, remaining in practice from 1832 to 1857. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1866.

==House of Representatives==
In 1846, Strong was elected to the United States House of Representatives as an abolitionist Democrat. Strong served two terms in the House, and was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Elections during his second term. He did not seek reelection in 1850, but returned to private practice.

==Judicial service==

===Supreme Court of Pennsylvania===
Strong was elected to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in 1857 as a Democrat, succeeding James Armstrong, who had been temporarily appointed to the seat. Strong switched to the Republican Party soon after taking the bench. He resigned from the court in 1868 to return to a lucrative private practice in Philadelphia.

===United States Supreme Court===
In December 1869, Justice Robert C. Grier announced his intention to retire from the United States Supreme Court effective February 1, 1870. President Ulysses S. Grant was heavily lobbied to nominate former Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Stanton was nominated, and confirmed by the United States Senate on December 20, 1869, but he died just four days later without having served on the Court. After Grier retired, Grant nominated Strong to succeed him. He was confirmed by the Senate on February 18, 1870, and was sworn in on March 14, 1870.

Strong ruled for states rights and against the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which had allowed African Americans to testify against Whites, in &quot;Bylew v. United States&quot;. In &quot;United States v. Given&quot;, 25 F. Cas. 1324 (C.C.D. Del. 1873), Strong, riding on circuit, upheld an indictment under the Enforcement Act of 1870 when election officials prevented black Americans from voting. Strong held that the Reconstruction Amendments allowed Congress to enact legislation punishing private individuals when a state failed to protect constitutional rights. Strong wrote the opinion for an early equal protection case in &quot;Strauder v. West Virginia&quot;, 100 U.S. 303 (1879).

====1876 election====
Strong was one of five Supreme Court justices who sat on the Electoral Commission that was convened to resolve the disputed electoral votes in the U.S. presidential election of 1876. Strong voted along with his fellow Republicans, who held the majority on the Commission, to award every disputed vote to Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican candidate, thus ensuring his presidency.

Strong served on the Supreme Court until December 14, 1880, when he retired despite still being in good health, partly to set an example for several infirm justices who refused to give up their seats. He resumed the practice of law and pursued religious causes until his death, at Lake Minnewaska in Ulster County, New York, on August 19, 1895. Following funeral services at the chapel of the Charles Evans Cemetery in Reading, Pennsylvania, he was laid to rest at that cemetery. The Historical Society of Berks County has in its collection a few pieces relating to Justice Strong.

===International arbitration===

After his retirement from the Supreme Court, Strong served as an arbitrator for an international dispute between Haiti and the United States, according to a 1884 agreement between the two nations. Two American citizens claimed damages due to the conduct of the Haitian government. He issued his award on June 13, 1885.

==Personal==

Justice William Strong&#x27;s grandson, Lieutenant William N. Strong, Jr. (1887-1919), of Washington, DC, served in the Canadian Army during World War I, enlisting in January 1915. He was gassed on the battlefield of Ypres, and in the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917. He died in Pasadena, California of complications from the gassing. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describes him as the first Washingtonian to join the Allies.

<doc id="854658" wikidata="Q5561977" url="?curid=854658" title="Gillard (kart manufacturer)">
<text>Gillard is a British kart manufacturer founded by Tim Gillard. In 2020, OTK Kart Group acquired Gillard and subsequently it became a brand of the Italian group which includes Tony Kart.

==History==
Gillard was founded in 1980 manufacturing racing karts in Bishops Stortford, England. Advertising for early 100cc karts prepared by Tim Gillard appeared in karting magazines by December 1980. Gillard&#x27;s karts were successful in Europe, notably with Peter de Bruijn&#x27;s team. In 1998, Kimi Raikkonen joined de Bruijn for the European Formula Super A championship in which he finished 2nd overall, racing a Gillard machine. 

Gillard chassis won the 2001 and 2004 KF1 European Kart Championships with Carlo van Dam and Nick de Bruijn respectively. In 2005 there was further success for Gillard with Oliver Oakes winning the 2005 FIA Karting World Championship and Michael Christensen winning the European Junior Championship. Formula One race winner Valtteri Bottas drove a Gillard in his 2005 and 2006 kart championship seasons. Further success for Gillard would follow in 2009 with Hayden McBride winning the Australian KF2 CIK Championship, and 2010 Joey Van Splunteren taking victory in the Rotax Eurochallenge.

Following acquisition in 2020, Tim Gillard retired from the company, and OTK Kart have continued to develop and manufacture models under the Gillard brand.

<doc id="854662" wikidata="Q241996" url="?curid=854662" title="Tankōbon">
<text>A is a standard publishing format for books in Japan, alongside other formats such as &quot;shinsho&quot; (17x11 cm paperback books) and &quot;bunkobon&quot;. Used as a loanword in English, the term specifically refers to a printed collection of a manga that was previously published in a serialized format. Manga typically contain a handful of chapters, and may collect multiple volumes as a series continues publication.

Major publishing imprints for of manga include Jump Comics (for serials in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and other &quot;Jump&quot; magazines), Kodansha&#x27;s Shōnen Magazine Comics, Shogakukan&#x27;s Shōnen Sunday Comics, and Akita Shoten’s Shōnen Champion Comics.

== Japanese comics (manga) ==

Increasingly after 1959, manga came to be published in thick, phone-book-sized weekly or monthly anthology manga magazines (such as &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; or &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;). These anthologies often have hundreds of pages and dozens of individual series by multiple authors. They are printed on cheap newsprint and are considered disposable. Since the 1930s, though, comic strips had been compiled into collecting multiple installments from a single series and reprinting them in a roughly paperback-sized volume on higher quality paper than in the original magazine printing. Strips in manga magazines and tankobon are typically printed in black and white, but sometimes certain sections may be printed in colour or using colored inks or paper.

In English, while a translation is usually marketed as a &quot;graphic novel&quot; or &quot;trade paperback&quot;, the transliterated terms and are sometimes used amongst online communities. Japanese speakers frequently refer to manga by the English loanword , although it is more widespread for being used in place of the word &quot;manga&quot;, as they are the same thing. The term also refers to the format itself—a comic collection in a trade paperback sized (roughly ) book (as opposed to the larger format used by traditional American graphic novels). Although Japanese manga tankobon may be in various sizes, the most common are Japanese B6 () and ISO A5 (). The format has made inroads in the American comics market, with several major publishers opting to release some of their titles in this smaller format, which is sometimes also called &quot;digest format&quot; or &quot;digest size&quot;. In the United States, many manga are released in the so-called &quot;Tokyopop trim&quot; or &quot;Tokyopop size&quot; (approximately ).

== Special formats ==
=== &quot;Aizōban&quot; ===
An is a collector&#x27;s edition volume. These volumes are generally more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition. A special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, etc. are generally printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and collectability of those few copies made. The format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot; being reissued in a similar format.

=== &quot;Bunkoban&quot; ===

A edition refers to a printed in &quot;bunko&quot; format, or a typical Japanese novel-sized volume. are generally A6 size () and thicker than and, in the case of manga, usually have a new cover designed specifically for the release. In the case of manga, a tends to contain considerably more pages than a and usually is a republication of of the same title which may or may not have been out of print. Thus, the edition of a given manga will consist of fewer volumes. For example, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot; was published in 21 volumes, and then re-released in 12 volumes. If the original manga was a &quot;wide-ban&quot; release, the release will generally have the same number of volumes.

=== &quot;Gōka Aizōban&quot; ===
A is another term occasionally used to designate a type of special release.

=== &quot;Kanzenban&quot; ===
The is yet another term sometimes used to denote a type of special release. A release is generally A5 size () and will typically reproduce individual chapter covers, colour pages, and side-stories from its original magazine run, features that are often omitted or converted to grayscale in standard releases. While the appellation emphasizes the value of the volumes, the term emphasizes their completeness.

=== &quot;Shinsōban&quot; ===
Similar to a &quot;wide-ban&quot;, a or is a special edition released with (usually) a new cover. The volumes in such a release usually have new colour pages and other extras. For example, in 2003, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was re-edited; some pages were completely redrawn, and most dialogues were rewritten by the author. The chapters were also redivided to fit into 12 volumes instead of 18.

=== &quot;Sōshūhen&quot; ===
The is a format published by Shueisha beginning in 2008. A edition is B5 size (), larger than a , and similarly reproduces chapter covers and colour pages while also including a variety of bonus features such as posters and interviews. The majority of releases are for popular manga with ongoing serializations. They also contain far more pages than a standard and thus feature more chapters in fewer volumes; &quot;Naruto&quot; Part I was originally published in 27 volumes, but was completed in just eight volumes.

=== &quot;Wide-ban&quot; ===
A wide-ban or edition is larger (A5 size) than a regular . Many manga, particularly  and manga, are published in &quot;wide-ban&quot; editions after magazine serialisation, and are never released in the format that is common in manga and manga. When a series originally published in format is re-released in &quot;wide-ban&quot; format, each volume will contain more pages than in the original edition, and therefore the series will consist of fewer volumes. For example, &quot;Inuyasha&quot; was originally released in 56 volumes, but was republished as 30 &quot;wide-ban&quot; volumes.

<text>Hyperspace Delivery Boy! is a puzzle action game released for the Pocket PC on December 23, 2001. It was ported to Microsoft Windows and Linux. The game was the first title released Monkeystone Games, a small developer formed by id Software and Ion Storm founders John Romero and Tom Hall, and Romero&#x27;s then-girlfriend Stevie Case. Much of the gameplay involves solving &quot;Sokoban&quot;-like puzzles.

==Plot==

&quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot; follows the story of Guy Carrington, a courier in training. Guy is sent by Sergeant Filibuster on several dangerous missions in four locations. During the course of the game, Guy discovers a secret organization known as &quot;THEM&quot;.

== Reviews ==
&quot;Hyperspace Delivery Boy!&quot; received average reviews from critics. Marc Saltzman of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; described the game as a &quot;fun diversion&quot; with &quot;challenging puzzles&quot;, but found the game repetitive and featured &quot;sophomoric dialogue&quot; and &quot;embarrassingly cheesy voice acting&quot;. Ron Dulin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; found the game to be fun, highlighting the challenge of the puzzle gameplay and &quot;personality&quot; of the game&#x27;s humor, but faulted the limited story and &quot;minimal&quot; sound effects and music.

<text>Antoine-Louis Barye (; 24 September 179525 June 1875) was a Romantic French sculptor most famous for his work as an &quot;animalier&quot;, a sculptor of animals. His son and student was the sculptor Alfred Barye.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, France, Barye began his career as a goldsmith, like many sculptors of the Romantic Period.
He first worked under his father Pierre, and around 1810 worked under the sculptor Martin-Guillaume Biennais, who was a goldsmith to Napoleon. After studying under sculptor Francois-Joseph Bosio in 1816, and painter Baron Antoine-Jean Gros, he was in 1818 admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. But it was not until 1823, while working for the goldsmith Emile Fauconnier that he discovered his true predilection from watching the animals in the Jardin des Plantes, making vigorous studies of them in pencil drawings comparable to those of Delacroix, then modeling them in sculpture on a large or small scale.

In 1819 while he was studying at the École des Beaux-Arts, Barye sculpted a medallion named &quot;Milo of Crotana Devoured by a Lion&quot;, in which the lion bites into Milo&#x27;s left thigh. Milo&#x27;s theme was the school&#x27;s official theme for the medallion competition of 1819, where Barye earned an honorable mention. c. 1820 Barye sculpted &quot;Hercules with the Erymanthean Boar&quot;, depicting Hercules&#x27;s fourth Labor, where he had to capture a live wild boar from Mount Erymanthos.

Barye was no less successful in sculpture on a small scale, and excelled in representing animals in their most familiar attitudes. Barye sculpted the portrait medallion &quot;Young Man in a Beret&quot; (1823) in bronze, as well as &quot;Portrait of the Founder Richard&quot; (1827), in which only a head and neck are shown. He also sculpted &quot;Poised Stag&quot; (1829), a much larger sculpture, which had a height of 48 cm, and was one-third life size.

Barye didn&#x27;t only want to be known as a sculptor of small bronzes, he wanted to be known as a &quot;sculpteur statuaire&quot; (a sculptor of large statues). In 1831 he exhibited much larger statues, &quot;Tiger Devouring a Gavial Crocodile&quot; which was a plaster sculpture 41 cm high and 103 cm long, and &quot;Lion Crushing a Serpent&quot;, 138 cm high and 178 cm long, made in bronze. In 1832 had truly mastered a style of his own in the &quot;Lion with a Snake&quot;.

Barye, though engaged in a perpetual struggle with want, exhibited year after year studies of animals, admirable groups which reveal him as inspired by a spirit of true romance and a feeling for the beauty of the antique, as in his &quot;Theseus and the Minotaur&quot; (1843), &quot;Roger and Angelica on the Hippogriff&quot; (1846)), &quot;Lapitha and Centaur&quot; (1848), &quot;Jaguar Devouring a Hare&quot; (1850), and numerous minor works now very highly valued. The latter two works were exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1850, causing Théophile Gautier to observe:&quot;The mere reproduction of nature does not constitute art; Barye aggrandizes his animal subjects, simplifying them, idealizing and stylizing them in a manner that is bold, energetic, and rugged, that makes him the Michelangelo of the menagerie.&quot;

Examples of his larger work include the &quot;Lion of the Column of July,&quot; of which the plaster model was cast in 1839, various lions and tigers in the gardens of the Tuileries, and the four groups &quot;War, Peace, Strength, and Order&quot; (1854).

While Barye excelled at sculpture, he often faced financial burdens due to his lack of business knowledge. In 1848 he was forced to declare bankruptcy, and all of his work and molds were sold to a foundry. The foundry began making inferior work from 1848 to 1857, and his reputation suffered during this time. In 1876 what remained of Barye&#x27;s inventory, 125 models, were sold to the Ferdinand Barbedienne foundry. The 1877 Barbedienne catalogue offered all of the models in bronze in variable sizes, and the Barbedienne castings were of superb quality.

Fame did not come until later in life. In 1854 he was made Professor of Drawings at the Museum of Natural History, and was elected to the Académie des beaux-arts in 1868. He produced no new works after 1869.

The mass of admirable work left by Barye entitles him to be regarded as one of the great animal life artists of the French animalier school, and the refiner of a class of art which has attracted such men as Emmanuel Frémiet, Paul-Édouard Delabrièrre, Auguste Cain, and Georges Gardet.

There is a public square on the eastern tip of Île Saint-Louis in Paris dedicated to him.

==Family==
Barye had a son, Alfred Barye, who studied under him and also became an animalier sculptor. Alfred, although very competent in his own right as a sculptor, would struggle to gain notoriety working in the shadow of his more famous father. Antoine-Louis was not pleased when his son began signing work as &quot;A. Barye&quot; because he thought this created confusion between his work and that of his son. He forced his son to sign as &quot;A. Barye, fils&quot; or &quot;Alf Barye&quot; in order to distinguish their works. The senior Barye signed only one way throughout his entire career, simply marking his bronzes &quot;Barye&quot;.

<doc id="854675" wikidata="Q469553" url="?curid=854675" title="Timken Company">
<text>The Timken Company is a global manufacturer of bearings and power transmission products. Timken operates from 42 countries.

The Timken Company brands include: Timken bearings; GGB bearings; American Roller Bearing and Engineered Solutions Group (iMECH); Lagersmit sealing solutions; Rollon, Nadella and Rosa Sistemi linear motion products; Philadelphia Gear and Cone Drive gear drive solutions; Groeneveld-BEKA lubrication systems; Lovejoy couplings and universal joints; Torsion Control Products spring couplings; R+L Hydraulics hydraulic components; Diamond and Drives chain; PT Tech industrial clutches and brakes and Des-Case filtration solutions. The company also operates Timken Power Systems, which supplies and services industrial drivetrain customers with repair, upgrade and service for bearings, gearboxes and electric motors.

== Company history==

In 1898, Henry Timken obtained a patent for an improved tapered roller bearing, and in 1899 incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St. Louis.

In 1901, the company moved to Canton, Ohio, as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry. Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel-making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland.

In 1917, the company began steel- and tube-making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings. World War I had created an increase in demand for steel, affecting its supply and price in the market.

Timken entered international markets in the early 1900s, establishing a presence initially in Great Britain, France and Germany. The performance of Timken tapered roller bearings in World War I military equipment made an impression on the European bearing market. After the war, Great Britain rose to the position of #2 in the global automotive manufacturing market, creating opportunities for Timken to expand its European manufacturing presence.

Timken entered the Great Depression in a strong financial position and its performance placed it in the ranks of the most solid, well-managed industrial firms of the 1930s. Expanding into non-automotive markets like agriculture, machine tooling, industrial and rail softened the impact.

During World War II, Timken production increased dramatically to keep up with wartime demand. For instance, every U.S. jeep was built using 24 Timken bearings. With 660,000 jeeps delivered to the U.S. military, Timken delivered more than 15.8 million bearings for those vehicles over the course of the war. Following the war, much of the machinery shipped to Europe under the Marshall Plan was Timken-bearing equipped, helping Timken establish a broader presence in a bearing market where European competitors had dominated.

By 1960, Timken had operations in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, France, South Africa, Australia and Brazil. Timken Research was created in 1966 to establish technological leadership and to help standardize research and development processes across the company.

Timken expanded into new global markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s, establishing a sales operation in Japan in 1974 and opening sales offices in Italy, Korea, Singapore and Venezuela in 1988. By the late 1990s Timken also had a sales presence in Spain, Hong Kong, China and Singapore.

Timken acquired its competitor, The Torrington Company, in 2003 for $840 million, doubling the size of the company and creating the world&#x27;s third-largest bearing manufacturer at that time.

The company changed its corporate structure in 2014; the roller bearing-producing part of the company was separated from the steel-producing part of the company, resulting in two separate companies. The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings, while TimkenSteel, which changed its name to Metallus in 2024, produces steel.

Timken entered the linear motion space in 2018 with the acquisition of Rollon, a maker of linear guides, telescopic rails, and linear actuators and systems used in a wide range of industrial and commercial applications. To further expand and strengthen its position in the attractive linear motion space, Timken acquired iMS in 2021 and added Nadella&#x27;s complementary product portfolio in 2023.

In 2023, Timken expanded its Industrial Motion segment with the acquisitions of Des-Case, Rosa Sistemi and Lagersmit. The company also bolstered its engineered bearings portfolio in 2023 with the acquisitions of American Roller Bearing and Engineered Solutions Group (iMECH).

== Company overview ==
Timken posted $4.8 billion in sales in 2023 and employs more than 19,000 people globally, operating from 45 countries.

Timken is focused on expanding its tapered roller bearings and growing its offering of industrial bearings and mechanical power transmission products and services. Today the company engineers, manufactures and markets bearings, gear drives, automated lubrication systems, belts, chain, couplings and linear motion products, and offers a spectrum of powertrain rebuild and repair services. Timken products are used in a variety of diversified markets including food and beverage, energy harvesting, marine vessels, mining, agriculture, construction, civil aerospace, defense and commercial vehicles.

In 2023, Timken’s wheel bearings were used on Ford Motor Company&#x27;s F-150 Lightning and Philadelphia Gear main reduction gears were installed in the latest generation of United States Navy ships.
