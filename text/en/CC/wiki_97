<text>East Flatbush is a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. East Flatbush is bounded by Crown Heights and Empire Boulevard to the north; Brownsville and East 98th Street to the east; Flatlands, Canarsie and the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Bay Ridge Branch to the south; and the neighborhood of Flatbush and New York Avenue to the west. East Flatbush is a predominantly African American neighborhood and has a population of 135,619 as of the 2010 United States census.

==Geography==
As with many neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the borders of East Flatbush are subjective/porous, but its northern border is roughly at Empire Boulevard and East New York Avenue east of East 91st Street, its southern border is in the vicinity of the Long Island Rail Road Bay Ridge Branch, its eastern border is roughly at East 98th Street and its western border is roughly at Nostrand/New York Avenues.

East Flatbush is split up into three subsections. From west to east they are Erasmus, Farragut, and Remsen Village/Rugby.

===Farragut===
The central section of East Flatbush is called Farragut. Farragut is roughly bounded by Cortelyou Road and Holy Cross Cemetery to the north, Kings Highway to the east, Brooklyn Avenue on the west, and the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch to the south. Farragut was originally part of the colonial Town of Flatbush, and was named for American Civil War Admiral David Farragut. The area was largely populated by Jews and Italians before 1950. By the 1990s, African Americans became a majority, along with many immigrants from the West Indies.

Farragut is adjacent to Paerdegat Woods, a formerly wooded area near Paerdegat Basin where real-estate developer Fred Trump constructed housing in the 1940s. Farragut also contains Flatbush Gardens (formerly named Vanderveer Estates), a 59-building complex erected in 1949. Vanderveer Estates was built on the site of the old Flatbush Water Works. The complex is one of the largest privately held working-class housing complexes in New York City, and owned in part by David Bistricer. Notable people who once lived in Vanderveer Estates include Barbra Streisand and Michael K. Williams.

===Remsen Village===
Remsen Village has been described as a &quot;subsection of the larger East Flatbush neighborhood,&quot; with an estimated 60,000 residents. but is also sometimes considered its own neighborhood and also as &quot;Rugby-Remsen Village&quot;. The origin of using the name &quot;Remsen Village&quot; seems to be in the mid-1990s. Remsen Village&#x27;s population is over one third of that of Brooklyn Community Board 17, which consists entirely of East Flatbush and its subsections.

The name &quot;Rugby&quot; was described in 2016 by the New York Times as &quot;the old name for the area.&quot; It persists as the name of a road in East Flatbush, as well as a library branch in eastern East Flatbush. The name &quot;Rugby&quot; was chosen be developers in the 1890s.

The area was populated after World War II predominantly by immigrant Jews and Italians, then in the 1960s by African Americans, but most recently has seen many West Indian immigrants such as Guyanese, Haitians, Jamaicans, Saint Lucians, Trinidadians, Grenadians, Vincentians, Bajans, Panamanians and Dominicans groups coming to the area. Within its confines is the Holy Cross Cemetery, Brooklyn, which is located at 3620 Tilden Avenue. While some residents are affluent, East Flatbush is mostly populated by working-class Brooklynites. Similar to other eastern Brooklyn neighborhoods, Blacks predominate East Flatbush. The area is 91.4% Black or African-American and 51% foreign born, the majority of whom are from the Caribbean. Considering this data, East Flatbush has been noted as being the single largest West Indian neighborhood in all of New York City and America as a whole.

According to the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, East Flatbush has been given three different names for three different sections, which are East Flatbush Erasmus to the west, East Flatbush Farragut to the east, and East Flatbush Rugby to the north. The Erasmus portion had between 30,000 and 39,999 Black residents and between 5,000 and 9,999 Hispanic residents, meanwhile each the White and Asian populations were under 5000 residents. The Rugby portion had 30,000 to 39,999 Black residents while each the Hispanic, White, and Asian populations were all under 5000 residents. The Farragut portion had 20,000 to 29,999 Black residents while each the Hispanic, White, and Asian population were also all under 5000 residents.

=== Little Caribbean and Little Haiti ===
Since the 1960s and especially through the 1970s, Caribbean immigrants have largely settled into East Flatbush, as well as in other surrounding areas such as Flatbush, and Crown Heights. Since 2017, the areas surrounding Nostrand and Church Avenues have been given the nickname, &quot;Little Caribbean&quot;. In addition to Little Caribbean, the south tip of the neighborhood has been given the name Little Haiti due to the high concentration of Haitians.

A drug epidemic ravaged East Flatbush during the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s, mostly in Vanderveer Estates. The intersection of Foster Avenue and Nostrand Avenues was nicknamed &quot;the Front Page&quot; because of media attention to drug murders there. The intersection of Foster between New York Avenue and Brooklyn Avenue area to the south was called &quot;the Back Page&quot; because its many murders went unnoticed. The area around the Nostrand playground had various gangs: Crips, Gangster Disciples, Jamaicans (Shower Posse), Trinidadians and Grenadians particularly notorious for turf wars, shootouts, and pitbull fights. Crime is still somewhat of a problem in the neighborhood today as well.

<text>Martin Joseph O&#x27;Malley (born January 18, 1963) is an American politician who served as the 17th commissioner of the Social Security Administration from 2023 to 2024. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 61st governor of Maryland from 2007 to 2015 and the 48th mayor of Baltimore from 1999 to 2007.

O&#x27;Malley was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1991 and re-elected in 1995. He was elected mayor of Baltimore in 1999 after a surprise win in the Democratic primary. He won a second term as mayor in 2004. As mayor, O&#x27;Malley prioritized reducing crime within the city. O&#x27;Malley won the 2006 Maryland gubernatorial election, unseating incumbent Republican governor Bob Ehrlich. During his first term as governor, O&#x27;Malley implemented Maryland StateStat and became the first governor to sign the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. O&#x27;Malley won reelection in 2010. In 2011, he signed a law that would make illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children eligible for in-state college tuition. In 2012, he signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage in Maryland. Both laws were approved in referendums in the 2012 general election. O&#x27;Malley served as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association from 2011 to 2013. After leaving office in 2015, O&#x27;Malley was appointed to The Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Carey Business School as a visiting professor focusing on government, business and urban issues.

Long rumored to have presidential ambitions, O&#x27;Malley publicly announced his candidacy for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination on May 30, 2015. One of six major candidates, O&#x27;Malley struggled to gain support, and he suspended his campaign on February 1, 2016, after finishing third in the Iowa caucuses. He endorsed Hillary Clinton four months later. Following his presidential campaign, he lectured at Georgetown University and Boston College Law School and has written two books about the use of technology in government. In July 2023, President Joe Biden nominated O&#x27;Malley to lead the Social Security Administration. He was confirmed by the United States Senate with a 50–11 vote on December 18, 2023.

In November 2024, O&#x27;Malley announced that he would run for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2025, seeking to succeed Jaime Harrison. He was defeated by Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party chair Ken Martin, placing third with the votes of 44 delegates.

==Early life and education==
Martin Joseph O&#x27;Malley was born on January 18, 1963, in Washington, D.C., the son of Barbara (née Suelzer) and Thomas Martin O&#x27;Malley. Martin&#x27;s father served as a bombardier in the U.S. Army Air Force in the Pacific theater during the Second World War, and recalled witnessing the mushroom cloud rise over Hiroshima while on a routine mission. Thomas later became a Montgomery County–based criminal defense lawyer, and an assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.

O&#x27;Malley attended the Our Lady of Lourdes School in Bethesda and Gonzaga College High School. He graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1985. Later that year, he enrolled in the University of Maryland School of Law, on the urban campus of the University of Maryland at Baltimore, earning his J.D. in 1988, and was admitted to the Maryland bar that same year.

==Early political career==
In December 1982, while still in college, O&#x27;Malley joined the Gary Hart presidential campaign for the 1984 election. In late 1983, he volunteered to go to Iowa where he phone-banked, organized volunteers, played guitar and sang at small fundraisers and other events. In 1986, while in law school, O&#x27;Malley was named by then-Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski as state field director for her successful primary and general election campaigns for the U.S. Senate. He served as a legislative fellow in Mikulski&#x27;s Senate office in 1987 and 1988. Later that year, he was hired as an assistant State&#x27;s Attorney for the City of Baltimore, holding that position until 1990.

In 1990, O&#x27;Malley ran for the Maryland State Senate in the 43rd State Senate District in northeast Baltimore. He challenged one-term incumbent John A. Pica in the Democratic Party primary, and lost by just 44 votes. He was considered an underdog when he first filed to run, but &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; to lead Pica on election night. The loss was narrow enough that his loss could only be projected after absentee ballots were counted subsequent to the night of the election.

==Baltimore City Council (1991–1999)==
In 1991, O&#x27;Malley was elected to the Baltimore City Council representing the 3rd Councilman District (when each of six districts had three members) and served from 1991 to 1999. His 1991 election was endorsed by the editorial board of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;.

As councilman, O&#x27;Malley served as chairman of the Legislative Investigations Committee and chairman of the Taxation and Finance Committee. As a councilman, O&#x27;Malley advocated for many reforms. During the 1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he served as the Maryland coordinator for the presidential campaign of Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey.

In 1996, O&#x27;Malley became a chief ally of City Council President Lawrence Bell at a time when Bell was engaged in a power-struggle with Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Fellow 3rd district councilor Joan Carter Conway joined O&#x27;Malley in aligning with Bell&#x27;s positions on key votes. However, the other council member from the third district, Robert W. Curran, broke with them and instead voted for the mayor&#x27;s preferred positions. O&#x27;Malley had previously been politically partnered with Curran, with the two having co-endorsed each other in the 1995 City Council election. Curran is also the uncle of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s wife. However, due to Curran&#x27;s alignment with the mayor, in October 1996 O&#x27;Malley wrote an open letter assailing him.

By his second term, O&#x27;Malley was seen as a charismatic rising star in Baltimore politics, and was believed to be likely to soon seek a higher office. In a 1997 profile, Kevin Cowherd of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote of O&#x27;Malley, 

==Mayor of Baltimore (1999–2007)==
===Elections===
O&#x27;Malley announced his decision to run for Mayor of Baltimore in 1999, after incumbent Kurt Schmoke decided not to seek re-election to a third term. His entrance into the race was greatly unexpected, and he faced initial difficulties as the only white candidate for mayor of a city which had been predominantly African-American since the 1960 Census and had recently had two successive black mayors. His strongest opponents in the crowded Democratic primary of seven were former City Councilman Carl Stokes, Baltimore Registrar of Wills Mary Conaway, and Council President Lawrence Bell. In his campaign, O&#x27;Malley focused on reducing crime and received the endorsement of several key African-American lawmakers and church leaders, as well as that of former mayor of Baltimore and Maryland governor William Donald Schaefer, who had served from 1971 to 1987. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary with a 53% majority and went on to win the general election with 90% of the vote, defeating Republican Party nominee, developer David Tufaro.

In 2003, O&#x27;Malley ran for re-election. He was challenged in the Democratic primary by four candidates, but defeated them with 67% of the vote. He had to wait more than a year to run in the general election because of a conflict between Maryland election law and the Baltimore city charter. At the same time that O&#x27;Malley won his first term, Baltimore citizens voted to move municipal elections to coincide with presidential elections. However, Maryland law gives the General Assembly sole power to set primary election dates, and the General Assembly refused to move the mayoral primary. In the November 4, 2004, general election, he was reelected with 87% of the vote. Due to the conflict, he was only elected to a three-year term rather than the usual four-year term.

===Police and crime===
During his first mayoral campaign, O&#x27;Malley focused on a message of reducing crime. In his first year in office, he adopted a statistics-based tracking system called &quot;CitiStat&quot;, modeled after Compstat, a crime-management program first employed in the mid-1990s in New York City. The system logged every call for service into a database for analysis. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 2006 that Baltimore&#x27;s &quot;homicide rate remains stubbornly high and its public school test scores disappointingly low. But CitiStat has saved an estimated $350 million and helped generate the city&#x27;s first budget surplus in years.&quot; In 2004, the CitiStat accountability tool won Harvard University&#x27;s &quot;Innovations in American Government&quot; award. The system garnered interest from not only Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty but even crime specialists from Britain.

His record as mayor of Baltimore has drawn criticism. O&#x27;Malley has been accused by many of establishing a zero-tolerance policing strategy, aimed at reducing the city&#x27;s high murder rate but that instead led to the targeting and abuse of black communities.

While running for governor in 2006, O&#x27;Malley said violent crime in Baltimore declined 37% while he was mayor. That statistic came from an audit of crime that used questionable methodology and became the subject of controversy; he was accused by both his Democratic primary opponent Doug Duncan and his Republican opponent, incumbent Governor Bob Ehrlich, of manipulating statistics to make false claims. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote at the time that &quot;no evidence has surfaced of a systemic manipulation of crime statistics,&quot; but that &quot;there is no quick or definitive way for O&#x27;Malley to prove his numbers are right.&quot;

===Politics===
O&#x27;Malley spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, arguing that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry was a better choice for homeland security than President George W. Bush. In early 2005, Governor Robert Ehrlich fired aide Joseph Steffen for spreading rumors of marital infidelity about O&#x27;Malley on the Internet. O&#x27;Malley and his wife had previously held a highly publicized press conference to deny the rumors and accuse Republicans of partisan politics, although discussions in which Steffen posted the rumors were initiated by an anonymous user under the pseudonym &quot;MD4Bush&quot; who was later found to be Maryland Democratic Party official Ryan O&#x27;Doherty.

During a 2005 conference at the National Press Club, where mayors from across the U.S. gathered to denounce President George W. Bush&#x27;s proposed budget, O&#x27;Malley compared the budget to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, declaring, &quot;Back on September 11, terrorists attacked our metropolitan cores, two of America&#x27;s great cities. They did that because they knew that was where they could do the most damage and weaken us the most. Years later, we are given a budget proposal by our commander in chief. ... And with a budget ax, he is attacking America&#x27;s cities. He is attacking our metropolitan core.&quot; For this he was criticized by not only Republicans but fellow Democrats, and in a subsequent interview said he &quot;in no way intended to equate these budget cuts, however bad, to a terrorist attack.&quot;

===Other matters===
O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s data-forward approach extended beyond policing, affecting many other areas of city management. An example of this was that his administration took measurement of the time it took to repair the city&#x27;s infrastructure in order to inform their approach to such work.

In 2002, O&#x27;Malley submitted a bid for the city to be the host of the 2004 Democratic Convention. This bid was considered a long-shot, as the city lacked a standard venue of sufficient space and capacity to host a major party presidential nominating convention. Baltimore&#x27;s bid proposed the unusual solution of erecting a temporary canopy at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in order to provide a venue. If Camden Yards were to host such a convention, it was likely that the Baltimore Orioles would have needed vacate the venue for a roughly two-month period of their 2004 season. Of the five cities to enter bids, Baltimore was the only one not considered as a finalist to host the convention, which was ultimately awarded to Boston.

===Media attention===
In 2002, at the age of 39, O&#x27;Malley was named &quot;The Best Young Mayor in the Country&quot; by &quot;Esquire&quot;; and in 2005, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine named him one of America&#x27;s &quot;Top 5 Big City Mayors&quot;. In August 2005, &quot;Business Week&quot; Magazine Online called him one of five &quot;new stars&quot; in the Democratic Party, along with Senator and future President Barack Obama of Illinois, future Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, future Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and future chief of staff for President Obama and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. &quot;Business Week&quot; declared that O&#x27;Malley &quot;has become the Party&#x27;s go-to guy on protecting the homeland. The telegenic Mayor has developed a detailed plan for rail and port safety and has been an outspoken critic of White House security priorities.&quot;

==Governor of Maryland (2007–2015)==
===Elections===

====2006====
O&#x27;Malley considered a run for governor in the 2002 election but decided not to run. In October 2005, after much speculation, he officially announced he would run in the 2006 election. He had one primary opponent, Montgomery County Executive Doug Duncan, who abruptly dropped out in June a few days after being diagnosed with clinical depression and endorsed O&#x27;Malley, who thus became the Democratic Party nominee with no primary opposition, challenging incumbent Bob Ehrlich. He selected Delegate Anthony Brown of Prince George&#x27;s County as his running mate for lieutenant governor.

The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; endorsed O&#x27;Malley, saying: &quot;When he was first elected mayor in 1999, the former two-term city councilman inherited a city of rising crime, failing schools, and shrinking economic prospects. He was able to reverse course in all of these areas.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; endorsed his opponent, but noted that O&#x27;Malley, while &quot;not solv[ing] the problems of rampant crime and rough schools in Baltimore,&quot; had &quot;put a dent in them&quot; while criticizing his gubernatorial campaign for being too focused on Baltimore and offering &quot;little of substance&quot; on Washington-area issues. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; complained that O&#x27;Malley, along with the Maryland General Assembly, had moved too far to the left. O&#x27;Malley led by margins of several points in most polls during the campaign, but polls tightened significantly in the last week of the campaign. He ultimately defeated Ehrlich 53% to 46% in the November 7, 2006, general election.

Major land developer Edward St. John was fined $55,000 by the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor for making illegal contributions to the 2006 O&#x27;Malley gubernatorial campaign. The &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported later that the Governor&#x27;s administration had issued a press release touting a new $28-million highway interchange leading from Interstate 795 to one of St. John&#x27;s properties. Governor O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s spokesman said there was no &quot;quid pro quo,&quot; and a spokesman for the County Executive said the project had been a county transportation priority since before both O&#x27;Malley and the executive were elected.

====2010====
In 2010, O&#x27;Malley announced his intention to run for re-election while Ehrlich announced he would also run, setting up a rematch of 2006. His future rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, said in a private email at the time that &quot;he should be reelected by acclamation for steering the ship of state so well.&quot; Despite major losses for Democrats nationwide, O&#x27;Malley defeated Ehrlich in a landslide 56% to 42%, receiving just over a million votes. Due to term limits, he was unable to run for a third term in 2014.

===First term===
====Budget====
O&#x27;Malley called a special session of the General Assembly in November 2007 to close a projected budget deficit of $1.7 billion for 2008–2009, in which he and other lawmakers passed a tax plan that would raise total state tax collections by 14%. In April 2009, he signed the traffic speed camera enforcement law he had supported and fought for to help raise revenue to try to overcome an imminent state deficit. Through his strenuous lobbying, the measure was revived after an initial defeat and passed on a second vote.

====Maryland StateStat====
One of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s first actions as governor was to implement the same CitiStat system he used to manage the city Baltimore as mayor on a statewide level. Maryland StateStat was first tried in 2007 by a few public safety and human services agencies. By 2014, over 20 agencies were engaged in the StateStat process through monthly individual agency meetings and quarterly cross-agency Stats including BayStat, StudentStat, VetStat and ReEntryStat. (The EPA would later base its ChesapeakeStat program on O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s innovative BayStat program.) In 2012, he launched Maryland&#x27;s Open Data Portal- StateStat, which used the data in the Portal to track progress towards his 16 strategic goals. As one of the few states at the time linking progress directly to open data, Maryland led the nation in government transparency and accountability. O&#x27;Malley has said that President Obama has looked at StateStat as a potential model for tracking stimulus funding.

====Democratic Party====
O&#x27;Malley was elected as the vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association for 2009–2010, and on December 1, 2010, he was elected chairman for 2010–2011.

====Crime====
Soon after entering office, O&#x27;Malley closed the Maryland House of Correction in Jessup, a notoriously violent maximum-security prison.

====National popular vote====
In April 2007, O&#x27;Malley became the first governor to sign legislation entering a state into the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Designed to reform how states allocate their electoral votes, the national popular vote plan has since been enacted in fourteen additional states and the District of Columbia.

===Second term===

====Immigration====

In a debate during the 2010 campaign, O&#x27;Malley referred to undocumented immigrants as &quot;new Americans&quot; while endorsing stricter enforcement against illegal immigration by the federal government. In May 2011, he signed a law making the children of undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition under certain conditions. The law provides that undocumented immigrants can be eligible for in-state tuition if they have attended a high school in Maryland for three years, and if they or their parents have paid state income taxes during that time. In response, Delegate Neil Parrott created an online petition to suspend the law pending a referendum to be voted on in the 2012 general election. On November 6, 2012, a majority (58%) of state voters passed referendum Question 4 in support of the law O&#x27;Malley had signed.

During the 2014 crisis involving undocumented immigrant children from Central America crossing the border, O&#x27;Malley refused to open a facility in Westminster, Maryland, to house them. The White House criticized his decision as hypocritical given his prior comments that he thought deporting all these children was wrong, but he protested that his remarks had been mischaracterized.

====Same-sex marriage====

O&#x27;Malley supported a bill considered by the General Assembly to legalize same-sex marriage in Maryland in 2011, even though Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin O&#x27;Brien had urged him as a Catholic not to support the bill in a private letter sent two days before O&#x27;Malley voiced his support. &quot;I am well aware that the recent events in New York have intensified pressure on you to lend your active support to legislation to redefine marriage,&quot; O&#x27;Brien wrote. &quot;As advocates for the truths we are compelled to uphold, we speak with equal intensity and urgency in opposition to your promoting a goal that so deeply conflicts with your faith, not to mention the best interests of our society.&quot; O&#x27;Malley responded, &quot;I do not presume, nor would I ever presume as Governor, to question or infringe upon your freedom to define, to preach about, and to administer the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. But on the public issue of granting equal civil marital rights to same-sex couples, you and I disagree.&quot;

The Maryland House of Delegates approved this bill by 72–67 on February 17, 2012 and the Maryland State Senate passed it by a 25–22 margin on February 23. It was amended to take effect only on January 1, 2013, pending a voter referendum. After O&#x27;Malley signed the bill on March 1, 2012, referendum petitioners collected the necessary signatures required to challenge the law, but Referendum Question 6 in support of same-sex marriage passed by 52.4% on November 6, 2012.

====Animal welfare====

In 2013, O&#x27;Malley signed a bill to ban the practice of shark finning in Maryland, making it the sixth U.S. state to enact this regulation. The signature of this bill made Maryland the first East Coast state to make it illegal to possess, sell, trade or distribute shark fins.

====Environment====
O&#x27;Malley opposed a 2011 lawsuit filed by the Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. against Perdue Farms, a poultry agribusiness corporation based in Maryland. The lawsuit accused Perdue of allowing run-off phosphorus pollution from one of its contact farms into Chesapeake Bay. In 2014, he also promised to veto the Poultry Fair Share Act which would require poultry companies in Maryland to pay taxes to clean up the Chesapeake Bay equal to the existing cleanup taxes required of Maryland citizens.

Also in 2014, O&#x27;Malley approved the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or &quot;fracking,&quot; in western Maryland but only on condition of tight regulations. He had previously blocked the technique from the region for three years, awaiting the report from the Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission on the risks and benefits of this controversial procedure.

In December 2014, O&#x27;Malley issued an executive order to drive a Zero-Waste future for Maryland, but the plan was later cancelled by O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s successor Larry Hogan in 2017 &quot;in response to complaints from local governments.

====Capital punishment====
O&#x27;Malley, a long-time opponent of capital punishment, signed a bill on May 2, 2013, that repealed capital punishment in Maryland for all future offenders. Although the repeal did not affect the five inmates then on death row in Maryland, O&#x27;Malley commuted the sentences of four of them to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

====Gun control====
O&#x27;Malley supported gun control in his second term. On May 16, 2013, he signed a new gun control bill into law.

====Reproductive rights====
O&#x27;Malley supports legal abortion rights without government interference, up to the point of fetal viability. In Maryland fetus viability is defined as when, in a doctor&#x27;s best medical judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus&#x27; sustained survival outside the uterus, which on average is 22–24 weeks.

==2016 presidential campaign==
After O&#x27;Malley stood in for 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a Democratic campaign event on June 2, 2007, in New Hampshire, Maryland&#x27;s Republican House Minority Leader Tony O&#x27;Donnell said in response, &quot;It&#x27;s the worst-kept secret in Maryland that the governor has national ambitions.&quot; State Senate President Thomas V. Miller Jr. said O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s political future &quot;comes into play in everything he does&quot;, adding O&#x27;Malley is &quot;very much like Bill Clinton in being slow and deliberative and calculating in everything he does.&quot; Speculation about O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s plans was further fueled by his high profile at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he was given a prime-time speaking slot on the second night and spoke to delegations from several states including Iowa, where the first presidential caucuses are held in election years, and Ohio, a key swing state in recent presidential elections. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s prominence at the convention generated both support for, and criticism of, his record. U.S. Senator Ben Cardin and Howard County Executive Ken Ulman praised his speech, with Ulman saying, &quot;To borrow a catchphrase from his address, his career is moving forward, not back.&quot;

O&#x27;Malley publicly expressed interest in a presidential run in 2016 on multiple occasions. At a press conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at a National Governors Association meeting in August 2013, he admitted he was laying &quot;the framework&quot; for a presidential run. In October 2014, he discussed some of his potential policies as president during a panel discussion with Paul Hawken and Tom Steyer. In April 2015, he said he expected to make a decision on the race by the end of May.

After months of consideration, O&#x27;Malley indicated on Twitter that he would announce his candidacy on May 30, 2015, at Baltimore&#x27;s historic Federal Hill Park, overlooking the city&#x27;s picturesque downtown skyline and the Inner Harbor. On that date, he formally announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential nomination.

On February 1, 2016, after performing poorly in the Iowa caucuses, however, he suspended his campaign, receiving only 0.6% of state delegate equivalents awarded in the Iowa caucuses while both former First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of New York and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont received over 49% each. After suspending his campaign, the former Maryland governor gave a speech, saying:

Tonight, I have to tell you that I am suspending this Presidential bid. But I am not ending this fight. Our country is worth saving, the American dream is worth saving, and this planet is worth saving. So as we march forward to the fall, let us all resolve together that the love, the generosity, the compassion and the commitment of this campaign will continue to point our country forward.

Four months later, on June 9, 2016, O&#x27;Malley officially endorsed Hillary Clinton.

==Subsequent work==
After the end of his presidential campaign, there was speculation that O&#x27;Malley was a possible choice for United States Secretary of Homeland Security, should Hillary Clinton be elected president. This speculation was rendered moot as Donald Trump was instead elected, eventually choosing John F. Kelly.

On May 5, 2016, O&#x27;Malley joined the MetroLab Network, a group focusing on city–university partnerships and based at Heinz College (the public policy school of Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was appointed chairman of the advisory committee and made a senior fellow. O&#x27;Malley was subsequently made a fellow of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. After the Democratic primaries, O&#x27;Malley explored a potential run for chair of the Democratic National Committee. He later withdrew interest after Minnesota representative Keith Ellison received the endorsements of several major Democratic figures.

In June 2016, Boston College Law School&#x27;s Rappaport Center for Law and Public Policy announced that O&#x27;Malley would be its inaugural Jerome Lyle Rappaport Visiting Professor and teach at the law school during the Spring 2017 semester.

The Baltimore Sun reported on May 31, 2017, that O&#x27;Malley admitted that he along with other Democrats gerrymandered the state&#x27;s 6th district in a successful effort to oust long-time Republican incumbent Rep. Roscoe Bartlett in 2012. In a 2013 deposition, O&#x27;Malley admitted, &quot;It was my intent to create…a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.&quot;

In November 2019, O&#x27;Malley encountered acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli II, in a Capitol Hill bar and confronted him with what &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported one witness described as a &quot;shame-invoking tirade&quot; centering on the Trump administration&#x27;s immigration policies. Also in 2019, O&#x27;Malley was elected to be a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (2023–2024)==
In July 2023, President Joe Biden announced he would nominate O&#x27;Malley to lead the Social Security Administration (SSA). The agency is headquartered in the suburbs west of Baltimore. On November 3, 2023, a confirmation hearing was held at the United States Capitol for the United States Senate Committee on Finance, where he reportedly received a positive reception. During his confirmation hearing, O&#x27;Malley vowed to focus on improving the agency&#x27;s customer service area and &quot;boosting the morale&quot; of the SSA. The committee ultimately voted to advance his nomination in a 17–10 vote. His nomination was confirmed on December 18, 2023, by the United States Senate by a 50–11 vote. He was sworn in on December 20, 2023. Prior to his confirmation, the agency had lacked a permanent Senate-confirmed head since July 2021. Since O&#x27;Malley was confirmed merely to complete the remainder of the unexpired term to which Andrew Saul had previously been appointed, his appointment would have expired in January 2025 had he not resigned sooner.

Lisa Rein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described O&#x27;Malley as assuming leadership of an agency that had been afflicted by numerous challenges, including the impact left by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, a shrunken agency workforce (its lowest in decades), poor employee morale, and issues with efficiency. O&#x27;Malley described improving its customer service as his first priority.

O&#x27;Malley instituted a number of changes to the agency&#x27;s operations after assuming leadership. One change has been simplifying forms (such as creating a &quot;no to all&quot; option on applications), removing excess requirements, and utilizing data exchange to decrease duplication. He has also worked to increase the shared distribution of workloads between different offices. He has also increased digitization, which has including expanding document upload and esignature access for staff and increasing the agencies &quot;digital-first&quot; approach to mail.

O&#x27;Malley has utilized his data-driven approach to leadership in this role. At the time that O&#x27;Malley assumed leadership, the agency was struggling with a significant backlog of pending claims in its disability program (a record-high 1 million). O&#x27;Malley analyzed data to find that the two greatest contributors to the length of processing times for claims were in state agency reviews and Social Security Agency-run hearings. The reviewed data also showed that the severity backlogs varied greatly between states. In response to these findings, O&#x27;Malley has pursued having the workload of handling claims be more flexibly shared, and has also sought greater engagement with external advocacy groups.

In a joint May 2024 commentary praising O&#x27;Malley as having been &quot;the commissioner Social Security needs&quot;, former U.S. congressmen Earl Pomeroy (a Democrat) and Dave Camp (a Republican) praised O&#x27;Malley as making positive changes, &quot;with diligence and speed, changing SSA&#x27;s policies and procedures faster than advocates have seen in generations.&quot; They particularly praised his ending of the agency&#x27;s practice of intercepting 100% of the monthly benefit of overpaid beneficiaries, instead making the default withholding rate 10%. Calling the previous practice &quot;heavy-handed,&quot; they credited O&#x27;Malley as, &quot;reframing SSA&#x27;s guidance to shift the burdens and presumptions to a more just balance [...] making it easier for beneficiaries to ask SSA to consider that — in some circumstances — they both cannot repay and were not at fault.&quot;

== 2025 Democratic National Committee chair candidacy ==
O&#x27;Malley resigned from the Social Security Administration on November 29, 2024, in order to launch his candidacy in the February 2025 election of a new Democratic National Committee chairperson. On February 1, 2025, he came in third with 44 votes in the DNC Chair race after winner Ken Martin.

==In popular culture==

According to David Simon, the creator of the HBO drama &quot;The Wire&quot;, the show&#x27;s fictional mayor of Baltimore Tommy Carcetti is &quot;not O&#x27;Malley,&quot; but O&#x27;Malley was one of several inspirations. Writing in &quot;Baltimore Magazine&quot; several years after the show had closed, Simon did disclose a private phone conversation with O&#x27;Malley as production of the show&#x27;s second season was beginning, in which the mayor urged that the show&#x27;s contents be changed to put Baltimore and his own administration in a better light, and threatened the show&#x27;s continuation in Baltimore unless such changes were made.

O&#x27;Malley appeared in the film &quot;Ladder 49&quot; as himself. He is a War of 1812 buff. History Channel&#x27;s 2004 documentary &quot;First Invasion: The War of 1812&quot; featured him in a segment regarding the British attack on Baltimore in 1814. He also appeared in the 2014 Travel Channel documentary &quot;The War of 1812 Trail&quot;. In 2019, he appeared on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to discuss his love of Shane MacGowan&#x27;s music.

==Honors==
The University of Galway awarded him an honorary degree in 2008.

==Personal life==

O&#x27;Malley met his wife, the former Catherine &quot;Katie&quot; Curran, in 1986 while they were both in law school. At the time, he was working on Barbara Mikulski&#x27;s U.S. Senate campaign and she was working on her father J. Joseph Curran Jr.&#x27;s campaign for attorney general of Maryland. They were married in 1990 and are the parents of four children, Grace, Tara, William and Jack. Before the 2006 election, O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s father-in-law, Joseph Curran, citing his age and his long career, decided not to seek re-election for attorney general, preventing any conflict of interest that might arise in having O&#x27;Malley as governor.

===Religion===
O&#x27;Malley is a Catholic, who was educated in Catholic schools and was described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2015 as &quot;a pray-every-morning, church-every-Sunday believer.&quot;

===O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s March===
O&#x27;Malley has said that he grew up surrounded by Irish music. While attending Gonzaga College High School in Washington D.C. in 1979, O&#x27;Malley and his football coach Danny Costello formed a band, Shannon Tide, which played Irish music and folk rock. After graduating from University of Maryland Law School, O&#x27;Malley went solo for a year. In 1988, he founded the Baltimore-based Celtic rock band O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s March, in which he is still the lead singer and plays acoustic guitar and penny whistle. In addition to Irish music, the band&#x27;s mainstays include June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land,&quot; the parlor song &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More,&quot; The Pogues &#x27; &quot;Body of an American&quot; and Passenger&#x27;s &quot;Scare Away The Dark&quot;. During O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s mayoralty he wrote and performed a number of songs celebrating his adopted city and its strong Irish heritage.

As the bicentennial of the War of 1812 approached in 2012–2015, while still Governor he and his compatriots celebrated the British defeat in the &quot;Battle for Baltimore&quot; and other musical numbers at a stirring concert in Patterson Park in East Baltimore on the anniversary of the land and sea attack on Defenders&#x27; Day in September 2014. In addition to more traditional venues, the band performs for O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s campaign events. In 2012, it played at the White House for 44th President Barack Obama as part of an extended Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration honoring Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny. O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s March continues to perform following O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s decision to end his 2016 presidential campaign. Through O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s March, he has become close to Leo Moran and other members of The Saw Doctors.

==Ancestry==
O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s father was of Irish descent; his paternal ancestors come from An Mám, County Galway. His matrilineal ancestry includes Irish, German, Dutch and Scottish. He is a member of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the General Society of the War of 1812.

<text>Glenn Edward &quot;Bo&quot; Schembechler Jr. ( ; April 1, 1929 – November 17, 2006) was an American college football player, coach, and athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Miami University from 1963 to 1968 and at the University of Michigan from 1969 to 1989, compiling a career record of 234 wins, 65 losses and 8 ties. Only Nick Saban, Joe Paterno and Tom Osborne have recorded 200 victories in fewer games as a coach in major college football. In his 21 seasons as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, Schembechler&#x27;s teams amassed a record of 194–48–5 and won or shared 13 Big Ten Conference titles. Though his Michigan teams never won a national championship, in all but one season they finished ranked, and 16 times they placed in the final top ten of both major polls.

Schembechler played college football as a tackle at Miami University, where in 1949 and 1950 he was coached by Woody Hayes, for whom he served as an assistant coach at Ohio State University in 1952 and from 1958 to 1962. In his first ten years at Michigan, Schembechler&#x27;s teams squared off in a fierce rivalry against Hayes&#x27;s Buckeyes squads. During that stretch in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry, dubbed the &quot;Ten-Year War,&quot; Hayes and Schembechler&#x27;s teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.

In 1988, Schembechler assumed the role of athletic director at Michigan, succeeding Don Canham, the man who hired him as football coach in 1969. Schembechler retired as head football coach after the 1989 season. His longtime assistants, Gary Moeller and Lloyd Carr, helmed the team for the next 18 years. Schembechler left the University of Michigan in 1990 to take a job as president of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Detroit Tigers, which he held until 1992. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1993. During his later years, Schembechler remained in Southeast Michigan and hosted a sports radio show. He died in 2006 at the age of 77 on the eve of that year&#x27;s Michigan–Ohio State football game, a historic No. 1 versus No. 2 showdown.

Outside of football, Schembechler came to posthumous public notoriety after 2018, when it was revealed that he was one of several high-ranking University of Michigan officials who covered up accusations of sexual assault against team doctor Robert Anderson. Anderson sexually assaulted more than 600 University of Michigan athletes, along with hundreds more individuals at other institutions.

==Early life==
Schembechler was born and raised in Barberton, Ohio, a suburb of Akron. His nickname &quot;Bo&quot; came from his sister&#x27;s attempts to say &quot;brother&quot; when they were young children. Schembechler&#x27;s father was a firefighter. One of Schembechler&#x27;s seminal experiences was seeing his father refuse to accept a stolen copy of a civil-service exam—despite the fact that the other applicant was reported to have received a stolen copy himself. Schembechler&#x27;s father took the exam without having received the answers, missed one more question than the other applicant, and did not receive the promotion he coveted. Schembechler often told the story, saying the experience taught him more about integrity than any lecture ever could have.

Schembechler attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He played football under two legendary, and completely different, coaches. Sid Gillman, his first coach at Miami, was an innovative offensive mind and one of the fathers of the modern passing game. His concepts helped to form the foundation for football&#x27;s West Coast offense. However, in early 1948, Gillman departed to become an assistant coach at Army, and was replaced by George Blackburn. Prior to Schembechler&#x27;s last season, Blackburn left to join Gillman&#x27;s coaching staff at Cincinnati, and he was replaced by Woody Hayes. The fiery Hayes embraced the run, eschewed the pass, and demanded tough, physical play from his linemen. Rather than innovation, Hayes stressed repetition—he wanted his players to run each play flawlessly. Over the next forty years, Hayes&#x27; impact on his young protege was clearly evident.
Schembechler graduated from Miami in 1951 and earned his master&#x27;s degree at Ohio State University in 1952 while working as a graduate assistant coach under Hayes, who had become OSU&#x27;s head coach. After a tour of duty in the U.S. Army, Schembechler served as an assistant at Presbyterian College in 1954, followed by a year as freshman coach at Bowling Green. When Schembechler&#x27;s former college teammate Ara Parseghian, Hayes&#x27; successor at Miami University, was hired as head coach at Northwestern in 1956, Schembechler joined him and spent the next two seasons there as a defensive assistant. In 1958, Hayes hired Schembechler to serve again on his staff at Ohio State. Schembechler spent five more years at Ohio State and became one of Hayes&#x27; most trusted assistants. During that time the two cemented their lifelong friendship. Schembechler was fond of recounting the number of times that Hayes &quot;fired&quot; him, only to send a graduate assistant to fetch him after tempers had calmed.

Schembechler, Hayes, Parseghian, and several of their &quot;Cradle of Coaches&quot; compatriots are the subject of the book &quot;Fields of Honor&quot;, written by coach John Pont&#x27;s niece, Sally Pont.

==Miami University==
In 1963, Schembechler returned to Miami University to become head coach of his alma mater. Over the next six seasons, Schembechler led the Redskins to a 40–17–3 record, winning a pair of Mid-American Conference titles and finishing second three times. The team&#x27;s top season was 1966, as Miami went 9–1 overall. Miami&#x27;s offense was led during those seasons by quarterbacks Ernie Kellerman and Bruce Matte.

Schembechler was a candidate vying to succeed Milt Bruhn as head coach at Wisconsin in 1967. Immediately after a 40-minute interview in which he was offended that the hiring committee didn&#x27;t take his candidacy seriously, he contacted athletic director Ivy Williamson to withdraw his name from consideration. Assistant coach John Coatta, who was the favorite to replace Bruhn from the start, was promoted. Schembechler continued to coach at Miami for two more seasons. His negative experience was a major factor in his convincing Bob Knight to reject Wisconsin&#x27;s offer to become men&#x27;s basketball head coach in 1968.

==University of Michigan==

Schembechler became Michigan&#x27;s 15th head coach after the 1968 season, succeeding Bump Elliott. He was hired in fifteen minutes. It took athletic director Don Canham that long &quot;to sense the intensity, the enthusiasm of a man destined to be a winner.&quot; Besides a stellar record at Miami he also &quot;brought a unique five-man angle defense and a guarantee that he would make it work within five years.&quot; At Michigan, Schembechler became one of college football&#x27;s greatest coaches. He won a school-record 194 games, lost only 48, and tied five for a winning percentage of .796. His teams never posted a losing season. In Big Ten Conference play, he had a record of 143–24–3 for a winning percentage of .850. His Michigan teams won or shared 13 Big Ten titles and made 10 Rose Bowl appearances. His record during the 1970s was the best of any Division I coach. Schembechler led the Wolverines to a total of 17 bowl games, going 5–12 in 21 years, placing him ninth in all-time bowl appearances. He was voted national coach of the year in 1969 by both the American Football Coaches Association and the Football Writers Association of America.

Schembechler&#x27;s greatest victory came in his first season, when he led the Wolverines to an upset victory over a standout Ohio State team coached by his old mentor, Woody Hayes. Hayes&#x27; Buckeyes dominated the series during the late 1950s and for most of the 1960s as Michigan fielded a number of uncharacteristically mediocre teams. In 1968, the year before Schembechler became head coach, Hayes made it clear how far Michigan had fallen behind its traditional rival, when the Wolverines lost 50–14. At the end of the game, Hayes decided to pursue a two-point conversion rather than a simple kick for an extra point. When Hayes was asked why he &quot;went for two,&quot; he responded, &quot;because they wouldn&#x27;t let me go for three.&quot; The embarrassment of that outcome set the stage for the 1969 rematch.

In 1969, the Buckeyes entered the game as defending national champions and 17-point favorites with the top ranking in the country and a 22-game winning streak. Hayes&#x27; 1969 squad included five first-team All-Americans. But Schembechler&#x27;s 7–2 Wolverines dominated a team Hayes later considered his best, beating Ohio State 24–12. In a single afternoon, Schembechler and his charges resurrected Michigan&#x27;s football tradition and returned the program among college football&#x27;s elite. Both Schembechler and Hayes, who remained personal friends until Hayes&#x27; death in 1987, agreed it was Hayes&#x27; best team and Schembechler&#x27;s biggest victory. Michigan&#x27;s win over Ohio State in 1969 is considered to be one of the greatest upsets in college football history and the most significant win for a Michigan team ever.
The Wolverines and Buckeyes proceeded to engage in a fierce &quot;Ten Year War&quot; that elevated an already storied Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry into one of college football&#x27;s greatest annual grudge matches. For ten years the two dominated the Big 10, splitting ten conference titles between them and finishing second eight times. They were so dominant that the Big Ten earned a nickname of &quot;Big Two, Little Eight&quot; during that era. After a decade of memorable on-field stratagems, sideline antics, and locker room psychological ploys, Schembechler held a 5–4–1 advantage.

Schembechler&#x27;s tenure at Michigan was also notable for the renewal of Michigan&#x27;s rivalry with Notre Dame. Despite the fact that the two schools are located within 200 miles of one another and ranked first/second in both total wins and winning percentage in college football, they had not played each other since the 1940s. The resurrection of the rivalry was facilitated by Schembechler&#x27;s close friendship with Ara Parseghian, Notre Dame&#x27;s coach at the time of Bo&#x27;s arrival. Schembechler, however, never had a chance to coach against his former mentor, as scheduling commitments prevented the series from resuming until 1978, after Parseghian had left Notre Dame and was succeeded by Dan Devine.
Despite Schembechler&#x27;s success during the regular season, he was less successful in bowl games. His overall record was 5–12, which includes a 2–8 record in the Rose Bowl. The Wolverines lost the 1970 Rose Bowl, their first bowl game under Schembechler, while he was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack on the previous day. Michigan went on to lose their next six bowl games before winning five of the last ten they played under Schembechler. The only four of his 21 Michigan teams that did not play in a bowl, however, were a shade short of perfection, losing a total of three games while compiling a combined record of 39-3-1. One loss was by three points and a second was lost in the last seconds when a 33-yard FG attempt was ruled to be just wide of the goalposts.

Following the 1980 season, Schembechler gained the first of his two Rose Bowl victories by beating the Washington Huskies. The 1980 Michigan team featured the talents of Anthony Carter, a three-time consensus All-American. In 1980 Michigan stumbled early in the season, losing two of its first three games. As a result of the two losses, Michigan was eliminated from consideration for college football&#x27;s national championship, finishing 4th in the end-of-season polls. But Schembechler maintained that his first Rose Bowl champions were the country&#x27;s best team by season&#x27;s end. They did not allow a touchdown over the course of their last five games, giving up nine points total.

Perhaps spurred by Carter&#x27;s success, Schembechler&#x27;s teams began to pass more during the 1980s, but Schembechler never completely shed his image as a run-first offensive coach. (A favorite saying of Schembechler was that &quot;there are three things that can happen when you pass, and two of them are bad.&quot;) At the same time, his teams continued to enjoy consistent success throughout the decade. Jim Harbaugh, a future NFL All-Pro quarterback and former head coach of the University of Michigan, led Schembechler&#x27;s 1985 team to a 10–1–1 record, a 27–23 win over Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl, and a No. 2 ranking in the final polls, the highest finish ever for one of Schembechler&#x27;s teams. Schembechler&#x27;s last two teams went to the Rose Bowl, splitting two games with USC.

Schembechler retired from coaching after the Rose Bowl in 1990. He decided to retire at the relatively young age of 60 because of his history of heart problems and was succeeded by Michigan&#x27;s offensive coordinator Gary Moeller, whom he handpicked.

Schembechler was also the athletic director at Michigan from 1988 until early 1990. Just before the 1989 NCAA basketball tournament, men&#x27;s basketball head coach Bill Frieder announced that he was taking the head coach position at Arizona State University, effective at the end of the season. Insisting on those in the program being dedicated to the school, Schembechler immediately fired Frieder and appointed assistant basketball coach Steve Fisher as interim head coach, while famously announcing that &quot;a Michigan man is going to coach a Michigan team&quot; in the NCAA tournament. The literal meaning of the Schembechler&#x27;s quote was that only a current, 100 percent-committed university employee would coach the team, not Frieder, whose loyalties had just switched to Arizona State. Ironically, Frieder was an alumnus of Michigan, while Fisher was not. Fisher led Michigan to six straight victories in the tournament and the 1989 national championship. Schembechler witnessed the championship game, an 80–79 overtime cliffhanger vs. Seton Hall, two days after his 60th birthday (the semifinal victory over Big Ten rival Illinois was played on Schembechler&#x27;s birthday). Fisher submitted Bill Frieder&#x27;s name to receive the championship ring, however someone, likely from Schembechler&#x27;s administration, removed his name. Schembechler would coach Michigan&#x27;s Rose Bowl team in 1990 while having secretly accepted the role of President for the Detroit Tigers, publicly announcing the hire after the game.

===&quot;Those Who Stay Will Be Champions&quot;===
Schembechler began his tenure as head coach at Michigan with a rallying cry to his players: &quot;Those who stay will be champions!&quot; This slogan foreshadowed the challenges Michigan football players would endure from the dramatic culture change initiated by Schembechler, who emphasized toughness and introduced practices and conditioning far more rigorous than any of the players had been exposed to before.

His first training camp in 1969 saw around 140 players enter but a mere 75 emerging from the grueling camp and choosing to embrace Schembechler&#x27;s system. Schembechler&#x27;s subsequent successes and legacy of propelling the Michigan football program to further national prominence immortalized his promise to his players after accepting the head coaching position at Michigan. Every Michigan football player who played for Bo Schembechler and stayed at Michigan for four years left Michigan with at least one Big Ten championship ring. Furthermore, not once did any Michigan player under Bo endure a losing season during his tenure. As such, &quot;Those Who Stay Will Be Champions&quot; remains a beloved team slogan for the Michigan Wolverines and has been immortalized into the tradition and mythology of Michigan football.

===Offer from Texas A&amp;M===
On January 15, 1982, Texas A&amp;M offered Schembechler nearly $3 million for 10 years—the richest contract in the history of college athletics at that time—to become the school&#x27;s football coach and athletic director. Schembechler turned it down. &quot;Frankly, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that there are things more important in this world than money,&quot; Schembechler said. &quot;For that reason, I&#x27;ve decided to stay at Michigan.&quot;

==After Michigan==
From 1990 to 1992, Schembechler was president of the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball. In 1991, he presided over the firing of Tigers&#x27; longtime broadcaster Ernie Harwell; the move was decried by fans and the press. Management at the Tigers&#x27; flagship radio station WJR later claimed responsibility for the sacking, but Schembechler and club owner Tom Monaghan were denounced for the decision. Schembechler was an opponent of female sports reporters in the men&#x27;s locker room, defending Tigers pitcher Jack Morris, who told a female &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reporter in 1990, &quot;I don&#x27;t talk to women when I&#x27;m naked unless they&#x27;re on top of me or I&#x27;m on top of them.&quot; Schembechler stated &quot;no female member of my family would be inside a men&#x27;s locker room regardless of their job description&quot; and suggested &quot;the whole thing was a scam orchestrated by you people to create a story.&quot; Schembechler was fired by the Tigers in early August 1992, via fax.

Schembechler maintained an office at the University of Michigan&#x27;s football facility, which is named Schembechler Hall. His former assistants, Gary Moeller (1990–94) and Lloyd Carr (1995–2007), followed him as head coach. Schembechler was also active in numerous private charities. He was named a Lifetime Member of the Detroit Sports Media Association.

He also hosted a pre-game show &quot;Big Ten Ticket&quot; on the Detroit ABC affiliate, WXYZ-TV along with sports anchor Don Shane. It was devoted to his analysis of the Wolverines, the Michigan State Spartans and other Big Ten Conference teams.

At Michigan&#x27;s annual spring commencement on April 30, 2005, Schembechler was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree.

==Health problems==
Schembechler had a long history of heart trouble. On December 31, 1969, the eve of his first Rose Bowl appearance, he suffered a heart attack, and had another in 1987 while he happened to be at University of Michigan Medical Center for tests. He had two quadruple heart bypass operations, the first in 1976 and the second following his second heart attack.

During a taping of the WXYZ-TV program &quot;Big Ten Ticket&quot; in late October 2006, Schembechler collapsed and was taken to the hospital. Following the episode, he had a heart pacemaker implanted into his chest to regulate his heartbeat. As late as a week before his death, he had stated his doctors were still adjusting the device, which covered about half his chest.

==Death==
On Thursday, November 16, 2006, although he was not feeling well, Schembechler attended the funeral of his close friend and 1971 quarterback, Tom Slade. That night, Bo delivered his traditional Thursday night pep talk before the Ohio State game. According to &quot;The Detroit News&quot;: &quot;Bo&#x27;s speech was not about Ohio State, the Big Ten title or a national championship. The whole speech was about Tom Slade and how, if the players worked hard, listened to their coaches and stuck together as teammates, one day they might be as good a Michigan man as Slade. That was the goal at Michigan, not national championships.&quot; Schembechler finished by exhorting them to remember &quot;the team, the team, the team!&quot;

The next day, on November 17, 2006, Schembechler collapsed in a restroom stall at WXYZ-TV just prior to the taping of &quot;Big Ten Ticket&quot; around 9:15 am. He was taken to Providence Hospital in Southfield, Michigan where he was pronounced dead. He was 77 years old. At a press conference a few hours after his death, it was reported by his doctor, Dr. Kim Eagle of the University of Michigan Health System, that his death was from the terminal stage of heart disease, where the heart muscle itself does not respond to the pacemaker, a common cause of death for persons afflicted with severe heart disease.
Schembechler died the day before one of the biggest games in the history of the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry. He was not planning to attend the November 18 game in Columbus. Instead, Bo and his wife, Cathy, had packed the car and had planned to drive to suburban Dayton, Ohio to watch the game with his former Miami teammate and friend, Bill Gunlock.

The university&#x27;s Regents approved a plan for the renovation and expansion of Michigan Stadium on the day of Schembechler&#x27;s death.

On November 21, 2006, the University of Michigan held a memorial service for Schembechler in Michigan Stadium. Approximately 20,000 fans, ex-players and coaches including former Schembechler player and assistant coach and then LSU head football coach Les Miles were in attendance, as well as former Ohio State head coaches Earle Bruce and John Cooper, along with then Ohio State head coach Jim Tressel and staff. Schembechler is interred at Forest Hill Cemetery in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Before his death, Schembechler had agreed to be an honorary pallbearer for former Michigan Wolverine and University of Michigan alumnus President Gerald Ford. Ford, himself a center at Michigan in the 1930s, died on December 26, 2006. A pew inside Washington National Cathedral was draped with a University of Michigan stadium blanket in Schembechler&#x27;s memory.

==Role in sexual assault scandal==
Beginning in 2018, hundreds of former student-athletes who played at the University of Michigan have come forward with allegations of inappropriate and unwanted medical treatment by university doctor Robert Anderson. Anderson was employed at the university from 1966 to 2003, and died in 2008. After many lawsuits, an independent investigation was conducted by WilmerHale, LLP. Their 240-page report stated that over 600 former student-athletes at the University of Michigan experienced these assaults.

One former player claims Schembechler told him to &quot;toughen up&quot; when he reported an incident of Anderson fondling his testicles during an examination.

In June 2021, Schembechler&#x27;s son Matt Schembechler came forward, saying he was molested at age ten by Anderson during a routine physical in the 1960s, and that Schembechler went to &quot;great lengths&quot; to ensure Anderson kept his job after Matt&#x27;s mother told AD Don Canham, who was ready to fire Anderson before Coach Schembechler&#x27;s intervention. Upon telling his father what happened, Matt said: &quot;That was the first time he closed-fist punched me. It knocked me all the way across the kitchen.&quot; Schembechler&#x27;s other son (and Matt&#x27;s younger half-brother), Glenn Schembechler, refused to believe Matt&#x27;s version and stated, &quot;I can tell you unequivocally no one ever told Bo&quot;, because in his opinion, &quot;Bo would have done something.&quot;

==Personal life==
After Schembechler married Mildred (Millie) in 1968, he adopted her three sons: Donald (Chip), Geoffrey, and Matthew. Then, Schembechler and Millie had a son, Glenn III (Shemy). Millie Schembechler died August 19, 1992, at University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, after an eight-month battle with a rare form of cancer. She was 63.

<text>Boisea trivittata, also called the eastern boxelder bug, box bug, or maple bug, is a species of true bug native to eastern North America. The western boxelder bug &quot;Boisea rubrolineata&quot; is a relative of this species and is native to western North America. Eastern boxelder bugs are found primarily on boxelder, other maples, and ash trees.

==Etymology==
Trivittata is from the Latin &quot;tri&quot; (three) + &quot;vittata&quot; (banded).

==Biology and description==
The adults are about long with a dark brown or black coloration, relieved by red wing veins and markings on the abdomen, with dark red eyes; nymphs are bright red.

Eastern boxelder bugs feed almost entirely on the developing seeds of boxelder, maple, and ash trees.

Eastern boxelder bugs feed, lay eggs and develop on boxelder trees, most commonly occurring on female trees as they produce seeds. Eastern boxelder bugs prefer seeds; however, they also suck leaves. They can be frequently observed on maple as these trees provide them with seeds as well. Eastern boxelder bugs overwinter in plant debris or protected human-inhabited places and other suitable structures.

==Taxonomy and similar species==
The eastern boxelder bug is sometimes confused with insects belonging to the genera &quot;Jadera, Pyrrhocoris, and Melacoryphus&quot;.

They may also be confused with the western boxelder bug (&quot;Boisea rubrolineata&quot;) which are near relatives in the same genus.

The name &quot;stink bug&quot;, which is more regularly applied to the family Pentatomidae, is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to &quot;Boisea trivittata&quot;. Instead, eastern boxelder bugs belong to the family Rhopalidae, the so-called &quot;scentless plant bugs&quot;. However, eastern boxelder bugs are strong-smelling and to discourage predators will release a pungent and bad-tasting compound upon being disturbed. This allows them to form conspicuous aggregations without being preyed on.

Eastern boxelder bugs are also sometimes confused with milkweed bugs, genus &quot;Lygaeus&quot; for having a similar appearance.

==Range==
Eastern boxelder bugs are a native species in North America.

The current range of this species covers the eastern United States, southern Canada, Mexico, and south into Guatemala. There have also been many sightings of them in South Africa, but there is a high chance that these individuals are a part of the species &quot;Boisea fulcrata&quot;, another related species.

In 2020, this species was introduced as a non-native species in Chile and is becoming an invasive species in that region. The introduction follows the use of maple trees as ornamental plantings.

==Overwintering, sometimes in homes==

Eastern boxelder bugs are not universally considered pests within their native range. Eastern boxelder bugs are harmless to people and pets. 

During certain times of the year eastern boxelder bugs cluster together in large groups while sunning themselves on warm surfaces near their host tree (e.g. on rocks, shrubs, trees, and man-made structures). 

This is especially a problem in the fall when they are seeking a warm place to overwinter. Large numbers are often seen congregating on houses seeking an entry point. 

If they gain access, they remain inactive behind siding and inside of walls while the weather is cool. 

Once the home&#x27;s heating system becomes active for the season, the insects may falsely perceive it to be springtime and enter inhabited parts of the home in search of food and water if there are any openings that allow them to do so. Once inside inhabited areas of a home, their excreta may stain upholstery, carpets, drapes, and they may feed on certain types of house plants. 

In the spring, the bugs leave their winter hibernation locations to feed and lay eggs on maple or ash trees. Clustered masses of eastern boxelder bugs may be seen again at this time, and depending on the temperature, throughout the summer. 

Their outdoor congregation habits and indoor excreta deposits are perceived as a nuisance by some people, therefore eastern boxelder bugs are often considered pests in those contexts. 

The removal of boxelder trees and maple trees can help control boxelder bug populations, but can also result in the loss of a native tree.

Providing ample native woodland or other natural landscape helps eastern boxelder bugs overwinter without becoming a nuisance, along with helping many other species within the same ecosystem such as ground bees also native to North America.

==Relationship to agriculture and gardening==

Although they specialize on eating the seeds from maple, boxelder and ash, they may pierce other parts of the plant while feeding, but incidentally. 

They are not classified as an agricultural pest and are generally not considered injurious to ornamental plantings. 

They are known to damage some fruits in the fall when they leave their summer quarters in trees and seek areas to overwinter. Feeding by the bugs produces dimples, scars, fruit deformation, corky tissue, and even premature fruit-drop in strawberries and some tree fruits. But they are not major agricultural pests.

==Predation by other animals==

Spiders and cats are minor predators, but because of the boxelder bug&#x27;s chemical defenses few birds or other animals will eat them. Boxelder bug populations are not affected by any major diseases or parasites.

<doc id="872243" wikidata="Q1346239" url="?curid=872243" title="Gary Webb">
<text>Gary Stephen Webb (August 31, 1955 – December 10, 2004) was an American investigative journalist.

He began his career working for newspapers in Kentucky and Ohio, winning numerous awards, and building a reputation for investigative writing. Hired by the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, Webb contributed to the paper&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Loma Prieta earthquake.

Webb is best known for his &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series, which appeared in &quot;The Mercury News&quot; in 1996. The series examined the origins of the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles and claimed that members of the anti-communist Contra rebels in Nicaragua had played a major role in creating the trade, using cocaine profits to finance their fight against the government in Nicaragua. It also stated that the Contras may have acted with the knowledge and protection of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The series provoked outrage, particularly in the Los Angeles African-American community, and led to four major investigations of its charges.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other major papers published articles suggesting the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; claims were overstated and, in November 1996, Jerome Ceppos, the executive editor at &quot;Mercury News,&quot; wrote about being &quot;in the eye of the storm&quot;. In May 1997, after an internal review, Ceppos stated that, although the story was correct on many important points, there were shortcomings in the writing, editing, and production of the series. He wrote that the series likely &quot;oversimplified&quot; the crack epidemic in America and the supposed &quot;critical role&quot; the dealers written about in the series played in it. Webb disagreed with this conclusion.

Webb resigned from &quot;The Mercury News&quot; in December 1997. He became an investigator for the California State Legislature, published a book based on the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series in 1998, and did freelance investigative reporting. He died by suicide on December 10, 2004.

The &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series remains controversial. Critics view the series&#x27; claims as inaccurate or overstated, while supporters point to the results of a later CIA investigation as vindicating the series. The follow-up reporting in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other papers has been criticised for focusing on problems in the series rather than re-examining the earlier CIA-Contra claims.

== Early life and education==
Webb was born in Corona, California. His father was a Marine sergeant, and the family moved frequently, as his career took him to new assignments. When Webb&#x27;s father retired from the Marines, the family settled in a suburb of Indianapolis, where Webb and his brother attended high school.

After high school, Webb attended a community college in Indianapolis on a scholarship until his family moved to Cincinnati, when he then transferred to nearby Northern Kentucky University.

Webb first began writing for the student newspaper at his college in Indianapolis. After transferring to Northern Kentucky, he entered its journalism program and wrote for the school paper, &quot;The Northerner&quot;. Although he attended Northern Kentucky for four years, he did not finish his degree. Instead, he found work in 1978 as a reporter at the &quot;Kentucky Post&quot;, a local paper affiliated with the larger &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot;. In 1979, Webb married Susan Bell; the couple went on to have three children.

==Career ==
Webb&#x27;s first major investigative work appeared in 1980, when &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; published &quot;The Coal Connection,&quot; a seventeen-part series by Webb and &quot;Post&quot; reporter Thomas Scheffey. The series, which examined the murder of a coal company president with ties to organized crime, won the national Investigative Reporters and Editors Award for reporting from a small newspaper.

In 1983, Webb moved to the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;, where he continued doing investigative work. A 1985 series, &quot;Doctoring the Truth,&quot; uncovered problems in the State Medical Board and led to an Ohio House investigation which resulted in major revisions to the state Medical Practice Act. Webb then moved to the paper&#x27;s statehouse bureau, where he covered statewide issues and won numerous regional journalism awards. In 1984, Webb wrote a story titled “Driving Off With Profits” which claimed that the promoters of a race in Cleveland paid themselves nearly a million dollars from funds that should have gone to the city of Cleveland. The article resulted in a lawsuit against Webb&#x27;s paper which the plaintiffs won. A jury awarded the plaintiffs over 13 million dollars and the case was later settled. In 1986, Webb wrote an article saying that the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, Frank D. Celebrezze accepted contributions from groups with organized crime connections. Celebrezze eventually sued the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; and won an undisclosed out of court settlement.

In 1988, Webb was recruited by the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, which was looking for an investigative reporter. He was assigned to its Sacramento bureau, where he was allowed to choose most of his own stories. As part of &quot;The Mercury News&quot; team that covered the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Webb and his colleague Pete Carey wrote a story examining the causes of the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct. &quot;The Mercury News&quot;&#x27;s coverage of the earthquake won its staff the Pulitzer Prize for General News Reporting in 1990.

==Dark Alliance series==

Webb began researching &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; in July 1995. The series was published in &quot;The Mercury News&quot; in three parts, from Sunday, 18 August 1996 to 20 August 1996, with a first long article and one or two shorter articles appearing each day. It was also posted on &quot;The Mercury News&quot; website with additional information, including documents cited in the series and audio recordings of people quoted in the articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjmercury/drugs/stories&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The website artwork showed the silhouette of a man smoking a crack pipe superimposed over the CIA seal. This artwork proved controversial, and &quot;The Mercury News&quot; later removed it.

The lede of the first article set out the series&#x27; basic claims: &quot;For the better part of a decade, a San Francisco Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and funneled millions in drug profits to a Latin American guerrilla army run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.&quot; This drug ring &quot;opened the first pipeline between Colombia&#x27;s cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles&quot; and, as a result, &quot;The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America.&quot;

To show this, the series focused on three men: Freeway Ricky Ross, Oscar Danilo Blandón, and Norwin Meneses. Ross was a major drug dealer in Los Angeles. Blandón and Meneses were Nicaraguans who smuggled drugs into the U.S. and supplied dealers like Ross. After introducing the three, the first article discussed primarily Blandón and Meneses, and their relationship with the Contras and the CIA. Much of the article highlighted the failure of law enforcement agencies to successfully prosecute them and stated that this was largely due to their Contra and CIA connections.

The second article described Blandón&#x27;s background and how he began smuggling cocaine to support the Contras. Meneses, an established smuggler and a Contra supporter as well, taught Blandón how to smuggle and provided him with cocaine. When Ross discovered the market for crack in Los Angeles, he began buying cocaine from Blandón. Blandón and Meneses&#x27; high-volume supply of low-priced high-purity cocaine &quot;allowed Ross to sew up the Los Angeles market and move on. In city after city, local dealers either bought from Ross or got left behind.&quot;

The third article discussed the social effects of the crack trade, noting that it had a disparate effect on African-Americans. Asking why crack became so prevalent in the Black community of Los Angeles, the article credited Blandón, referring to him as &quot;the Johnny Appleseed of crack in California.&quot; It also found disparities in the treatment of Black and White traffickers in the justice system, contrasting the treatment of Blandón and Ross after their arrests for drug trafficking. Because Blandón cooperated with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), he spent only 28 months in prison, became a paid government informant, and received permanent resident status. Ross was also released early after cooperating in an investigation of police corruption, but was rearrested a few months later in a sting operation arranged with Blandón&#x27;s help. The article suggested this was in retribution for Ross&#x27; testimony in the corruption case.

=== Response to the series ===
After the publication of &quot;Dark Alliance,&quot; &quot;The Mercury News&quot; continued to pursue the story, publishing follow-ups to the original series for the next three months. Other papers were slow to pick up the story, but African Americans quickly took note, especially in South Central Los Angeles where the dealers discussed in the series had been active. They were outraged by the series&#x27;s charges.

California senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein also took note and wrote to CIA director John Deutch and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, asking for investigations into the articles&#x27; allegations. Maxine Waters, the representative for California&#x27;s 35th district, which includes South Central Los Angeles, was also outraged by the articles and became one of Webb&#x27;s strongest supporters. Waters urged the CIA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate.

By the end of September, three federal investigations had been announced: an investigation into the CIA allegations conducted by CIA Inspector-General Frederick Hitz, an investigation into the law enforcement allegations by Justice Department Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, and a second investigation into the CIA by the House Intelligence Committee.

Webb&#x27;s continuing reporting also triggered a fourth investigation. The first article in &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; that discussed the failure of law enforcement agencies to prosecute Blandón and Meneses had mentioned several cases. One of these was a 1986 raid on Blandón&#x27;s drug organization by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which the article suggested had produced evidence of CIA ties to drug smuggling that was later suppressed. When Webb wrote another story on the raid evidence in early October, it received wide attention in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department began its own investigation into the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; claims.

=== Coverage in other papers ===
After the announcement of federal investigations into the claims made in the series, other newspapers began investigating, and several papers published articles suggesting the series&#x27; claims were overstated.

The first detailed article on the series&#x27;s claims appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in early October. In their front-page article, reporters Roberto Suro and Walter Pincus wrote that &quot;available information&quot; did not support the series&#x27; claims and that &quot;the rise of crack&quot; was &quot;a broad-based phenomenon&quot; driven in numerous places by diverse players. The article discussed Webb&#x27;s contacts with Ross&#x27;s attorney and prosecution complaints of how Ross&#x27;s defense had used Webb&#x27;s series.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; published two articles on the series in mid-October, both written by reporter Tim Golden. One article, dealing mostly with the response of the Los Angeles Black community to the stories, described the series&#x27; evidence as &quot;thin&quot;. Golden also referred to the controversy over Webb&#x27;s contacts with Ross&#x27;s lawyer. The other article, citing interviews with current and former intelligence and law-enforcement officials, questioned the importance of the drug dealers discussed in the series, both in the crack cocaine trade and in supporting the Nicaraguan Contras&#x27; fight against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; devoted the most space to the story, publishing a three-part series called &quot;The Cocaine Trail.&quot; The series ran from October 20–22, 1996, and was researched by a team of 17 reporters. The three articles in the series were written by four reporters: Jesse Katz, Doyle McManus, John Mitchell and Sam Fulwood. The first article, by Katz, developed a different picture of the origins of the crack trade than &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; had described, with more gangs and smugglers participating. The second article, by McManus, was the longest of the series and dealt with the role of the Contras in the drug trade and CIA knowledge of drug activities by the Contras. McManus wrote that Blandón&#x27;s and Meneses&#x27;s contributions to Contra organizations were significantly less than the &quot;millions&quot; claimed in the series, and stated there was no evidence that the CIA had tried to protect them. The third article, by Mitchell and Fulwood, covered the effects of crack on African-Americans and how it affected their reaction to some of the rumors that arose after the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series.

In 2013, Jesse Katz, a former &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter, said of the newspaper&#x27;s coverage &quot;As an &quot;L.A. Times&quot; reporter, we saw this series in the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; and kind of wonder[ed] how legit it was and kind of put it under a microscope, and we did it in a way that most of us who were involved in it, I think, would look back on that and say it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the &quot;L.A. Times&quot; and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California.&quot; And &quot;we really didn&#x27;t do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter&#x27;s career.&quot;

=== &quot;The Mercury News&quot;&#x27;s response ===
Surprised by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; article, &quot;The Mercury News&#x27;s&quot; executive editor Jerome Ceppos wrote to the &quot;Post&quot; defending the series. The &quot;Post&quot; refused to print his letter. Ceppos also asked reporter Pete Carey to write a critique of the series for publication in &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, and had the controversial website artwork changed. Carey&#x27;s critique appeared in mid-October and went through several of the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s criticisms of the series, including the importance of Blandón&#x27;s drug ring in spreading crack, questions about Blandón&#x27;s testimony in court, and how specific series allegations about CIA involvement had been, giving Webb&#x27;s responses.

When the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; series appeared, Ceppos again wrote to defend the original series. He also defended the series in interviews with all three papers. The extent of the criticism, however, convinced Ceppos that &quot;The Mercury News&quot; had to acknowledge to its readers that the series had been subjected to strong criticism. He did this in a column that appeared on November 3, defending the series, but also committing the paper to a review of major criticisms.

Ceppos&#x27; column drew editorial responses from both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. An editorial in the &quot;Times&quot;, while criticizing the series for making &quot;unsubstantiated charges&quot;, conceded that it did find &quot;drug-smuggling and dealing by Nicaraguans with at least tentative connections to the Contras&quot; and called for further investigation.

The &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s response came from the paper&#x27;s ombudsman, Geneva Overholser. Overholser was harshly critical of the series, &quot;reported by a seemingly hotheaded fellow willing to have people leap to conclusions his reporting couldn&#x27;t back up.&quot; But while calling the flaws in the series &quot;unforgivably careless journalism,&quot; Overholser also criticized the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; refusal to print Ceppos&#x27; letter defending the series and sharply criticized the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; coverage of the story. Calling the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; overall focus &quot;misplaced&quot;, Overholser expressed regret that the paper had not taken the opportunity to re-examine whether the CIA had overlooked Contra involvement in drug smuggling, &quot;a subject &quot;The Post&quot; and the public had given short shrift.&quot;

In contrast, the series received support from Steve Weinberg, a former executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors. In a long review of the series&#x27; claims in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, Weinberg said &quot;I think the critics have been far too harsh. Despite some hyped phrasing, &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; appears to be praiseworthy investigative reporting.&quot;

After the series&#x27;s publication, the Northern California branch of the national Society of Professional Journalists voted Webb &quot;Journalist of the Year&quot; for 1996. Despite the controversy that soon overtook the series, and the request of one board member to reconsider, the branch&#x27;s board went ahead with the award in November.

=== End of the series ===
After Ceppos&#x27; column, &quot;The Mercury News&quot; spent the next several months conducting an internal review of the story. The review was conducted primarily by editor Jonathan Krim and reporter Pete Carey, who had written the paper&#x27;s first published analysis of the series. Carey ultimately decided that there were problems with several parts of the story and wrote a draft article incorporating his findings.

The paper also gave Webb permission to visit Central America again to get more evidence supporting the story. By January, Webb filed drafts of four more articles based on his trip, but his editors concluded that the new articles would not help shore up the original series&#x27;s claims.

The editors met with Webb several times in February to discuss the results of the paper&#x27;s internal review and eventually decided to print neither Carey&#x27;s draft article nor the articles Webb had filed. Webb was allowed to keep working on the story and made one more trip to Nicaragua in March. At the end of March, Ceppos told Webb that he was going to present the internal review findings in a column. After discussions with Webb, the column was published on May 11, 1997.

In the column, Ceppos defended parts of the article, writing that the series had &quot;solidly documented&quot; that the drug ring described in the series did have connections with the Contras and did sell large quantities of cocaine in inner-city Los Angeles.

But, Ceppos wrote, the series &quot;did not meet our standards&quot; in four areas. 1) It presented only one interpretation of conflicting evidence and in one case &quot;did not include information that contradicted a central assertion of the series.&quot; 2) The series&#x27;s estimate of the money involved was presented as fact instead of as an estimate. 3) The series oversimplified how the crack epidemic grew. 4) The series &quot;created impressions that were open to misinterpretation&quot; through &quot;imprecise language and graphics.&quot;

Ceppos noted that Webb did not agree with these conclusions. He concluded, &quot;How did these shortcomings occur? ... I believe that we fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine.&quot;

== Resignation ==
Webb disagreed with Ceppos&#x27;s column and, in interviews, was critical of the paper&#x27;s handling of the story. Editors at the paper, on the other hand, felt that Webb had failed to tell them about information that contradicted the series&#x27;s claims and that he &quot;responded to concerns not with reasoned argument, but with accusations of us selling him out.&quot; In June 1997, &quot;The Mercury News&quot; told Webb it was transferring him from the paper&#x27;s Sacramento bureau and offered him a choice between working at the main offices in San Jose under closer editorial supervision, or spot reporting in Cupertino; both locations were long commutes from his home in Sacramento. Webb eventually chose Cupertino, but was unhappy with the routine stories he was reporting there and the long commute. 

He resigned from the paper in November 1997.

== Federal investigation results ==
The reports of the three federal investigations into the claims of &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; were not released until over a year after the series&#x27; publication. The reports rejected the series&#x27; main claims but were critical of some CIA and law enforcement actions.

=== Justice Department report ===
The Department of Justice Inspector-General&#x27;s report was released on July 23, 1998. According to the report&#x27;s &quot;Epilogue,&quot; the report was completed in December 1997 but was not released because the DEA was still attempting to use Danilo Blandón in an investigation of international drug dealers and was concerned that the report would affect the viability of the investigation. When Attorney General Janet Reno determined that a delay was no longer necessary, the report was released unaltered.

The report covered actions by Department of Justice employees in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the DEA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and U.S. Attorneys&#x27; Offices. It found that &quot;the allegations contained in the original &quot;Mercury News&quot; articles were exaggerations of the actual facts.&quot; After examining the investigations and prosecutions of the main figures in the series, Blandón, Meneses and Ross, it concluded that &quot;Although the investigations suffered from various problems of communication and coordination, their successes and failures were determined by the normal dynamics that affect the success of scores of investigations of high-level drug traffickers … These factors, rather than anything as spectacular as a systematic effort by the CIA or any other intelligence agency to protect the drug trafficking activities of Contra supporters, determined what occurred in the cases we examined.&quot;

It also concluded that &quot;the claims that Blandón and Meneses were responsible for introducing crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles and spreading the crack epidemic throughout the country were unsupported.&quot; Although it did find that both men were major drug dealers, &quot;guilty of enriching themselves at the expense of countless drug users,&quot; and that they had contributed money to the Contra cause, &quot;we did not find that their activities were responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic in South Central Los Angeles, much less the rise of crack throughout the nation, or that they were a significant source of support for the Contras.&quot;

The report called several of its findings &quot;troubling.&quot; It found that Blandón received permanent resident status &quot;in a wholly improper manner&quot; and that for some time the Department &quot;was not certain whether to prosecute Meneses, or use him as a cooperating witness.&quot; Regarding issues raised in the series&#x27;s shorter sidebar stories, it found that some in the government were &quot;not eager&quot; to have DEA agent Celerino Castillo &quot;openly probe&quot; activities at Ilopango Airport in El Salvador, where covert operations in support of the Contras were undertaken, and that the CIA had indeed intervened in a case involving smuggler Julio Zavala. It concluded, however, that these problems were &quot;a far cry from the type of broad manipulation and corruption of the federal criminal justice system suggested by the original allegations.&quot;

=== CIA report ===
The CIA Inspector-General&#x27;s report was issued in two volumes. The first one, &quot;The California Story,&quot; was issued in a classified version on December 17, 1997, and in an unclassified version on January 29, 1998. The second volume, &quot;The Contra Story,&quot; was issued in a classified version on April 27, 1998, and in an unclassified version on October 8, 1998.

According to the report, the Inspector-General&#x27;s office (OIG) examined all information the agency had &quot;relating to CIA knowledge of drug trafficking allegations in regard to any person directly or indirectly involved in Contra activities.&quot; It also examined &quot;how CIA handled and responded to information regarding allegations of drug trafficking&quot; by people involved in Contra activities or support.

The first volume of the report found no evidence that &quot;any past or present employee of CIA, or anyone acting on behalf of CIA, had any direct or indirect dealing&quot; with Ross, Blandón, or Meneses or that any of the other figures mentioned in &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; were ever employed by or associated with or contacted by the agency.

It found nothing to support the claim that &quot;the drug trafficking activities of Blandón and Meneses were motivated by any commitment to support the Contra cause or Contra activities undertaken by CIA.&quot; It noted that Blandón and Meneses claimed to have donated money to Contra sympathizers in Los Angeles, but found no information to confirm that it was true or that the agency had heard of it.

It found no information to support the claim that the agency interfered with law enforcement actions against Ross, Blandón or Meneses.

=== House committee report ===
The House Intelligence Committee issued its report in February 2000. According to the report, it used Webb&#x27;s reporting and writing as &quot;key resources in focusing and refining the investigation.&quot; Like the CIA and Justice Department reports, it also found that neither Blandón, Meneses, nor Ross were associated with the CIA.

Examining the support that Meneses and Blandón gave to the local Contra organization in San Francisco, the report concluded that it was &quot;not sufficient to finance the organization&quot; and did not consist of &quot;millions,&quot; contrary to the claims of the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series. This support &quot;was not directed by anyone within the Contra movement who had an association with the CIA,&quot; and the Committee found &quot;no evidence that the CIA or the Intelligence Community was aware of these individuals’ support.&quot; It also found no evidence to support Webb&#x27;s suggestion that several other drug smugglers mentioned in the series were associated with the CIA, or that anyone associated with the CIA or other intelligence agencies was involved in supplying or selling drugs in Los Angeles.

== &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; book ==

After his resignation from &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, Webb expanded the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series into a book that responded to the criticism of the series and described his experiences writing the story and dealing with the controversy. It was published in 1998 as &quot;Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion&quot;. A revised version was published in 1999 that incorporated Webb&#x27;s response to the CIA and Justice Department reports. The February 2000 report by the House Intelligence Committee in turn considered the book&#x27;s claims as well as the series&#x27; claims.

&quot;Dark Alliance&quot; was a 1998 Pen/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award Finalist, 1998 &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; bestseller, 1999 Bay Area Book Reviewers Award Finalist, and 1999 Firecracker Alternative Book Award-winner in the Politics category.

== Webb&#x27;s later views ==
In interviews after leaving &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, Webb described the 1997 controversy as media manipulation. &quot;The government side of the story is coming through the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot;, he stated. &quot;They use the giant corporate press rather than saying anything directly. If you work through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA.&quot; Webb&#x27;s longest response to the controversy was in &quot;The Mighty Wurlitzer Plays On,&quot; a chapter he contributed to an anthology of press criticism: 

Within &quot;The Mighty Wurlitzer Plays On&quot; essay Webb stated he believed there was an active &quot;collusion between the press and the powerful&quot; to report freely on inconsequential matters, &quot;but when it comes to the real down and dirty stuff... We begin to see the limits of our freedoms&quot;. He also stated &quot;the series presented dangerous ideas&quot; by suggesting &quot;crimes of state had been committed&quot; (i.e. that the &quot;federal government bore some responsibility, however indirect, for the flood of crack that coursed through black neighborhoods in the 1980s&quot;).

Webb wrote later that he &quot;never believed, and never wrote, that there was a grand CIA conspiracy behind the crack plague [...] The CIA couldn’t even mine a harbor without getting its trench coat stuck in its fly.&quot;

== Later career ==
After leaving &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, Webb worked as an investigator for the California State Legislature. His assignments included investigating racial profiling by the California Highway Patrol and charges that the Oracle Corporation had received a no-bid contract award of $95 million in 2001.
While working at the legislature, Webb continued to do freelance investigative reporting, sometimes based on his investigative work. For instance, he wrote an article regarding racial profiling in traffic stops which appeared in the April 1999 edition of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;esquire/a1223/0499&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb later moved to the State Assembly&#x27;s Office of Majority Services. He was laid off in February 2004 when Assembly Member Fabian Núñez was elected Speaker.

In August 2004, Webb joined the &quot;Sacramento News &amp; Review&quot;, an alternative weekly newspaper, where he continued doing investigative writing. One of his last articles examined &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;, a video game designed by the U.S. Army.

== Death ==
Webb was found dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner&#x27;s office. According to a description of Webb&#x27;s injuries in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he shot himself with a .38 revolver, which he placed near his right ear. The first shot went through his face, and exited at his left cheek. The coroner&#x27;s staff concluded that the second shot hit an artery.

After a local newspaper reported that Webb had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner&#x27;s office received so many calls asking about Webb&#x27;s death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had died by suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: &quot;It&#x27;s unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility.&quot; There were widespread Internet rumors at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series, published eight years before.

Webb&#x27;s ex-wife, Susan Bell, told reporters that she believed Webb had died by suicide. &quot;The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide,&quot; she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.

After Webb&#x27;s death, a collection of his stories from before and after the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series was published. The collection, &quot;The Killing Game: Selected Stories from the Author of Dark Alliance&quot;, was edited by Webb&#x27;s son, Eric.

== Legacy ==

=== Views on Webb&#x27;s journalism ===
Views on Webb&#x27;s journalism have been polarized. During and immediately after the controversy over &quot;Dark Alliance,&quot; Webb&#x27;s earlier writing was examined closely. A January 1997 article in &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; noted that a 1994 series Webb wrote had also been the subject of a &quot;Mercury News&quot; internal review that criticized Webb&#x27;s reporting. A &quot;New York Times&quot; profile of Webb in June 1997 noted that two of his series written for the Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; had resulted in lawsuits that the paper had settled.

On the other hand, many of the writers and editors who worked with him have had high praise for him. Walter Bogdanich, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who worked with Webb on &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, told &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; editor Susan Paterno &quot;He was brilliant; he knew more about public records than anybody I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot; Mary Anne Sharkey, Webb&#x27;s editor at &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, told writer Alicia Shepard in 1997 that Webb was known as &#x27;the carpenter&#x27; &quot;because he had everything nailed down. Gary&#x27;s documentation is awesome and his work ethic is unbelievable.&quot; California Representative Maxine Waters, who was Webb&#x27;s strongest supporter in Congress after the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; controversy broke, issued a statement after Webb&#x27;s death calling him &quot;one of the finest investigative journalists that our country has ever seen.&quot;

Jonathan Krim, &quot;The Mercury News&quot; editor who recruited Webb from &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and who supervised &quot;The Mercury News&quot; internal review of &quot;Dark Alliance,&quot; told &quot;AJR&quot; editor Paterno that Webb &quot;had all the qualities you&#x27;d want in a reporter: curious, dogged, a very high sense of wanting to expose wrongdoing and to hold private and public officials accountable.&quot; But as Krim told Webb&#x27;s biographer Nick Schou, &quot;The zeal that helped make Gary a relentless reporter was coupled with an inability to question himself, to entertain the notion that he might have erred.&quot; Scott Herhold, Webb&#x27;s first editor at &quot;The Mercury-News&quot;, wrote in a 2013 column that &quot;Gary Webb was a journalist of outsized talent. Few reporters I&#x27;ve known could match his nose for an investigative story. When he was engaged, he worked hard. He wrote well. But Webb had one huge blind side: He was fundamentally a man of passion, not of fairness. When facts didn&#x27;t fit his theory, he tended to shove them to the sidelines.&quot;

=== Views on &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series ===
The claim in the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; series that the drug ring of Meneses-Blandón-Ross sparked the &quot;crack explosion&quot; has been criticized. Nick Schou, a journalist who wrote a 2006 biography of Webb, has claimed that this was the most important error in the series. Writing on the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; opinion page, Schou said, &quot;Webb asserted, improbably, that the Blandón-Meneses-Ross drug ring opened &#x27;the first pipeline between Colombia&#x27;s cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles,&#x27; helping to &#x27;spark a crack explosion in urban America.&#x27; The story offered no evidence to support such sweeping conclusions, a fatal error that would ultimately destroy Webb, if not his editors.&quot;

While finding this part of the series unsupported, Schou said that some of the series&#x27;s claims on CIA involvement are supported, writing that &quot;The CIA conducted an internal investigation that acknowledged in March 1998 that the agency had covered up Contra drug trafficking for more than a decade.&quot; According to Schou, the investigation &quot;confirmed key chunks of Webb&#x27;s allegations.&quot; In a 2013 article in the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, Schou wrote that Webb was &quot;vindicated by a 1998 CIA Inspector General report, which revealed that for more than a decade the agency had covered up a business relationship it had with Nicaraguan drug dealers like Blandón.&quot;

Writing after Webb&#x27;s death in 2005, &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine&#x27;s former Washington Editor David Corn said that Webb &quot;was on to something but botched part of how he handled it.&quot; According to Corn, Webb &quot;was wrong on some important details, but he was, in a way, closer to the truth than many of his establishment media critics who neglected the story of the real CIA-contra-cocaine connection.&quot; Like Schou, Corn cites the inspector general&#x27;s report, which he says &quot;acknowledged that the CIA had indeed worked with suspected drugrunners (sic) while supporting the contras.&quot;

Not all writers agree that the inspector general&#x27;s report supported the series&#x27;s claims. Jeff Leen, assistant managing editor for investigative reporting at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote in a 2014 opinion page article that &quot;the report found no CIA relationship with the drug ring Webb had written about.&quot; Leen, who covered the cocaine trade for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; in the 1980s, rejects the claim that &quot;because [the report] uncovered an agency mindset of indifference to drug-smuggling allegations&quot;, it vindicated Webb&#x27;s reporting.

Peter Kornbluh, a researcher at George Washington University&#x27;s National Security Archives, also does not agree that the report vindicated the series. Noting that most of the activities discussed in the report had nothing to do with the people Webb reported on, Kornbluh told Schou, &quot;I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a vindication. It was good that his story forced those reports to come out, but part of what made that happen was based on misleading information.&quot;

=== Films ===
&quot;Kill the Messenger&quot; (2014) is based on Webb&#x27;s book &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; and Nick Schou&#x27;s biography of Webb. Actor Jeremy Renner portrays Webb.

=== TV ===
&quot;Snowfall&quot; is an American crime drama television series set in Los Angeles in 1983. The series revolves around the first crack epidemic and its impact on the culture of the city. The series follows the stories of several characters whose lives are fated to intersect including CIA operative Teddy McDonald who helps to secure guns for the Contras.

<doc id="872257" wikidata="Q7024442" url="?curid=872257" title="Nicaraguan Democratic Force">
<text>The Nicaraguan Democratic Force (&#x27;, orFDN) was one of the earliest Contra groups, formed on August 11, 1981, in Guatemala City. It was formed to oppose Nicaragua&#x27;s revolutionary Sandinista government following the 1979 overthrow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. It merged the 15th of September Legion, which comprised mostly former members of Somoza&#x27;s National Guard, with the Nicaraguan Democratic Union, an organization of émigrés from the business and professional classes. The new FDN also began assimilating the MILPAS movement, bands led by disenchanted former MAP-ML guerrillas. The FDN military was under the command of former National Guard colonel Enrique Bermúdez. The FDN was heavily backed by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Reagan administration. The FDN was also alleged to be engaged in drug trafficking in order to finance its war against the Sandinista government. 

==Commanders==
Some of the FDN&#x27;s most notable commanders include:
*Suicida – &quot;Pedro Pablo Ortiz Centeno&quot;. Former Guard sergeant, operated in the Jalapa area. Legendary for his eagerness for battle, but never fully adjusted from conventional to guerrilla warfare. Went into virtual mutiny in the fall of 1983, and was executed for committing atrocities.
*Franklin &quot;[Franklyn]&quot; – &quot;Israel Galeano Cornejo&quot;. Regional commander of &quot;Jorge Salazar II&quot;, considered perhaps the FDN&#x27;s best commander. Supporter of Tigrillo&#x27;s pre-FDN band. Helped to lead the late 1989 ouster of Bermúdez and the political leadership. Forged alliances with brother Commandos from ARDE Frente Sur leading to significant battlefield victories. Died in a suspicious automobile accident in 1992 in Northern Nicaragua.
*Toño – &quot;Walter Saúl Calderón López&quot;. Former Guard lieutenant, first commander of the &quot;Jorge Salazar&quot;, later led the &quot;Tactical Operations Command&quot;. Expelled after supporting a bid to oust Enrique Bermúdez in 1988.
*Mike Lima – &quot;Luis Alfonso Moreno Payan&quot;. Ex-Guard lieutenant, commander of the &quot;Diriangén&quot;. Known for the capture of Pantasma in 1983. Left field command for staff duties after crippling wounds.
*Tigrillo – &quot;Encarnación Valdivia [Baldivia] Chavarría&quot;. Ex-Sandinista, already leading a ragged MILPAS guerrilla band before joining the FDN. Commander of the &quot;Rafaela Herrera&quot;, roaming Jinotega Department. A charismatic leader, credited with recruiting thousands into the FDN. Chronically resentful of Bermúdez&#x27;s favoritism for ex-Guardsmen, he backed the 1988 mutiny.
*Mack – &quot;José Benito Bravo Centeno&quot;. Former Guardsman, commander of the &quot;Nicarao Regional Commando&quot;, operating in the Ocotal area. Gained a reputation for abuses, coupled with a lukewarm will to fight.
*Rubén – &quot;Oscar Manuel Sobalvarro García&quot;. Surviving member of the MILPAS movement. Originally took the nom de guerre &quot;Culebra&quot; (Snake), but changed it due to the CIA&#x27;s public relations concerns. Led the &quot;Salvador Perez Regional Commando&quot; in lower Jinotega, and became head of the council of field commanders following the late 1989 reorganization.
*Jhonson – &quot;Luis Adán Fley González&quot;. Former Sandinista and early member of Tigrillo&#x27;s band. After serving in the &quot;Special Operations Command&quot;, he founded the &quot;15th of September Regional Commando&quot;, in Matagalpa Department&#x27;s Pancasán region.
*Quiché – &quot;Juan Ramón Rivas Romero&quot;. Former Guard sergeant, Toño&#x27;s deputy commander in &quot;Task Force Jorge Salazar&quot;. He assumed command after Toño left, leading it as it grew into the FDN&#x27;s largest force, with five regional commandos. In 1988, Bermúdez selected him to become chief of staff.
*Rigoberto – &quot;Tirso Ramón Moreno Aguilar&quot;. Cattle merchant from Jinotega, and member of Dimas&#x27; MILPAS band. Regional commander of &quot;Jorge Salazar I&quot;, expelled for supporting the anti-Bermúdez movement in 1988.
*Moisés – &quot;José Efrén Martínez Mondragón&quot;. Guard sergeant who led the FDN&#x27;s first major strike, the demolition of the Somotillo bridge on March 14, 1982. Made task force commander of the &quot;José Dolores Estrada&quot;. In 1985, Mondragón sought exile in Mexico, where he was sent back to Nicaragua. Under duress, he urged his former comrades to accept amnesty, but was arrested and murdered in March 1988 after making overtures to return to the rebels.
*Fernando – &quot;Diógenes Hernández Membreño&quot;. Regional commander of &quot;Jorge Salazar III&quot;; an evangelical pastor who joined the rebels due to Sandinista persecution of his congregation. After being promoted to the general staff, he became disenchanted with Bermúdez, and was ousted after participating in the 1988 mutiny.

<text>The Baffin Region was a region of the Northwest Territories, in use as an administrative and statistical division until the creation of Nunavut in 1999. In 1967, it was created as the Baffin Region, Northwest Territories. The large majority of the Baffin Region fell on the Nunavut side of the boundary and was reconstituted within the new territory as the Qikiqtaaluk Region (also referred to as &quot;Baffin Region&quot; in some contexts). Several of the islands on the region&#x27;s west side that remained in the NWT, including Eglinton Island, Prince Patrick Island and parts of Melville Island, were transferred to the Inuvik Region.

<doc id="872259" wikidata="Q336690" url="?curid=872259" title="Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh">
<text>Edward Cecil Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh, (10 November 1847 – 7 October 1927) was an Anglo-Irish businessman and philanthropist. A member of the prominent Guinness family, he was the head of the family&#x27;s eponymous brewing business, making him the richest man in Ireland. A prominent philanthropist, he is best remembered for his provision of affordable housing in London and Dublin through charitable trusts. 
==Public life==
Born at St. Anne&#x27;s in Clontarf, Dublin, Guinness was the third son of Sir Benjamin Guinness, 1st Baronet, and younger brother of Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. He was educated by private tutor before entering Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated with BA in 1870 and MA in 1872. He was High Sheriff of Dublin City in 1876 and of the county in 1885. That same year, he was created a baronet of Castleknock, County Dublin, for helping with the visit of the then Prince of Wales to Ireland. In 1891, Guinness was created Baron Iveagh, of Iveagh in County Down. He was appointed a Knight of St Patrick (KP) in 1895, and ten years later was advanced in the Peerage of the United Kingdom to Viscount Iveagh. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Dublin City Artillery Militia in 1899. Elected to the Royal Society in 1906, he was two years later elected nineteenth Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1908–1927, he served as a vice-president of the Royal Dublin Society from 1906 to 1927. In 1910 he was appointed GCVO on the occasion of the King&#x27;s visit to Elveden. In 1919, he was created Earl of Iveagh and Viscount Elveden, of Elveden in the County of Suffolk.

==Business==
Lord Iveagh was managing director of the Guinness partnership and company, from his father&#x27;s death in 1868 until 1889, running the largest brewery in the world - it spanned . He later became chairman of the board for life.

By the age of 29 he had taken over sole ownership of the Dublin brewery after buying out the half-share of his older brother Lord Ardilaun for £600,000 in 1876. Over the next 10 years, Guinness brought unprecedented success to St James&#x27;s Gate, multiplying the value of his brewery enormously. By 1879 he was brewing 565,000 hogsheads of stout. Seven years later, in 1886, he was selling 635,000 hogsheads in Ireland, 212,000 in Britain, and 60,000 elsewhere, a total of 907,000 hogsheads.

He then became the richest man in Ireland after floating two-thirds of the company in 1886 on the London Stock Exchange for £6 million before retiring a multi-millionaire at the age of 40. He remained chairman of the new public company Guinness, and was its largest shareholder, retaining about 35% of the stock. The amount can be compared to the 1886 GDP of the UK, which was £116 million. By 1914 the brewery&#x27;s output had doubled again from the 1886 level, to 1,877,000 hogsheads.

In 1902 he commissioned the Guinness Storehouse, that is today one of Ireland&#x27;s main tourist attractions.

==Public housing==

Like his father and brother, Lord Iveagh was a generous philanthropist and contributed almost £1 million to slum clearance and housing projects, among other causes. In London this was the &#x27;Guinness Trust&#x27;, founded in 1890, that at present manages &quot;over 66,000 homes&quot;. Most of his aesthetic and philanthropic legacy to Dublin is still intact. The Dublin branch of the Guinness Trust became the Iveagh Trust in 1903, by a local act of Parliament, the Iveagh Trust Act 1903 (3 Edw. 7. c. iii), which funded the largest area of urban renewal in Edwardian Dublin, and still provides over 10% of the social housing in central Dublin. In 1908 he gave the large back garden of his house at 80 Stephens Green in central Dublin, known as the &quot;Iveagh Gardens&quot;, to the new University College Dublin, which is now a public park. Previously he had bought and cleared some slums on the north side of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and in 1901 he created the public gardens known as &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Park&quot;. In nearby Francis Street he built the Iveagh Market to enable street traders to sell produce out of the rain.

Iveagh was portrayed as &quot;Guinness Trust&quot; in a &quot;Spy&quot; cartoon in July 1891.

==Medical and scientific research==
Iveagh also donated £250,000 to the Lister Institute in 1898, the first medical research charity in the United Kingdom (to be modelled on the Pasteur Institute, studying infectious diseases). In 1908, he co-funded the Radium Institute in London. He also sponsored new physics and botany buildings in Trinity College Dublin in 1903, and part-funded the students&#x27; residence at Trinity Hall, Dartry, in 1908.

Iveagh helped finance the British Antarctic Expedition (1907–09) and Mount Iveagh, a mountain in the Supporters Range in Antarctica, is named for him.

==Art collector==
Interested in fine art all his life, from the 1870s Guinness amassed a distinguished collection of Old Master paintings, antique furniture and historic textiles. In the late 1880s he was a client of Joe Duveen buying screens and furniture; Duveen realised that he was spending much more on fine art at Agnews, and refocused his own business on art sales. He later recalled Guinness as a: &quot;stocky gentleman with a marked Irish brogue&quot;.

While he was furnishing his London home at Hyde Park Corner, after he had retired, he began building his art collection in earnest. Much of his collection of paintings was donated to the nation after his death in 1927 and is housed at the Iveagh Bequest at Kenwood, Hampstead, north London. While this lays claim to much of his collection of paintings, it is Farmleigh that best displays his taste in architecture as well as his tastes in antique furniture and textiles.
Iveagh was also a patron of then-current artists such as the British portraitist Henry Keyworth Raine

==Political life==
Iveagh&#x27;s father had sat as a Conservative MP for Dublin in the 1860s, as did his brother Arthur in the 1870s. Iveagh limited his involvement to acting as High Sheriff of County Dublin in 1885, mindful of the growing movement towards Irish Home Rule in the 1880s and the growth of the electorate under the 1884 Act. He did however stand as a Conservative for the seat of Dublin St Stephen&#x27;s Green in the 1885 general election, losing to the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate.

Given his wealth he preferred to effect social improvements himself, and preferred a seat in the House of Lords, which he achieved in 1891. He supported the Irish Unionist Alliance. In 1913 he refused to lock out his workforce during the Dublin Lockout. In 1917–18, he took part in the ill-fated Irish Convention that attempted find a moderate solution to the Irish nationalists&#x27; demands. Though opposed to Sinn Féin, he had a personal friendship with W. T. Cosgrave who emerged as the first leader of the Irish Free State in 1922.

Like many others in the Irish business world, he had feared that Irish Home Rule would result in new taxes or customs duties between Dublin and Britain, his largest market. The existing free trade within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland would likely turn protectionist, causing a loss of sales, employment and profits. In the event, the new Free State increased the tax on sales within Ireland, but not on exports.

==Sporting interests==
On land, Iveagh&#x27;s favourite hobby was to drive a coach-and-four (horses), a very physical activity, occasionally driving from Dublin to the Punchestown Racecourse about 20 miles away, and back. He also was a keen yachtsman, and in 1897 he won a race between England and Kiel that was sponsored by Kaiser Wilhelm. A member of several clubs including the Royal St. George Yacht Club, his main boat was the 204-ton schooner &quot;Cetonia&quot; which he bought in 1880, making frequent appearances at Cowes Week until 1914.

==Record estate==
After his death in 1927 at Grosvenor Place, London, Iveagh was buried at Elveden, Suffolk. His estate was assessed for probate at £13,486,146 16s. 2d. (roughly equivalent to £ in ). This remained a British record until the death of Sir John Ellerman in 1933. Although probate was sought in Britain, a part of the death duties was paid to the new Irish Free State. His will bequeathed Kenwood House in Hampstead to the nation as a museum for his art collection, known as the &quot;Iveagh Bequest&quot;.

In 1936 his family installed the &quot;Iveagh Window&quot; in his memory, in the north transept of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin. The window was designed and made by Sir Frank Brangwyn.

In 1939 Iveagh&#x27;s sons gave his Dublin home at 80 St. Stephen&#x27;s Green to the Irish Free State, and it was renamed Iveagh House. Since then it has been the home of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and &quot;Iveagh House&quot; has become the metonym of the department.

==Family==
In 1873, Iveagh married his third cousin Adelaide Maria Guinness (1844–1916), nicknamed &quot;Dodo&quot;. She was descended from the banking line of the Guinness family, and was the daughter of Richard Guinness, barrister and MP, and his wife Katherine, a daughter of Sir Charles Jenkinson, 10th Baronet.

Adelaide&#x27;s most famous portrait was painted circa 1885 by George Elgar Hicks.
They had three sons:
* Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh (1874–1967)
* Hon. (Arthur) Ernest Guinness (1876–1949)
* Walter Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne (1880–1944)

<text>Wanda Radio Station (Polish &quot;Radiostacja Wanda&quot;), was a Soviet Polish language propaganda broadcast station during World War II.

Created in 1944, the Wanda Radio Station was attached to the Red Army units fighting on the Eastern Front. It operated daily, broadcasting news, lectures, and recorded Polish songs.

Before the Warsaw Uprising the broadcasts vowed for an armed uprising to be started in Warsaw in order to ease the crossing of the Vistula river by the Red Army. However, after the Uprising did break out the station halted all broadcasts and started to play music only. After the capitulation of the uprising on September 2, 1944 the broadcasts were restarted. Soviet propaganda underlined that general Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski was a traitor and that the Home Army started the uprising with no coordination with the Soviets.

There was also a German-controlled Wanda Radio Station in Rome during World War II. It was created in late 1943 and its main purpose was to encourage Polish troops fighting in Italy to desert.

<doc id="872277" wikidata="Q28348" url="?curid=872277" title="Nicky Hopkins">
<text>Nicholas Christian Hopkins (24 February 1944 – 6 September 1994) was an English pianist and organist. He performed on many popular and enduring British and American rock music recordings from the 1960s to the 1990s, including on songs recorded by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Steve Miller Band, Jefferson Airplane, Rod Stewart, George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, The Hollies, Cat Stevens, Carly Simon, Harry Nilsson, Joe Walsh, Peter Frampton, Jerry Garcia, Jeff Beck, Joe Cocker, Art Garfunkel, Badfinger, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Donovan. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest studio pianists in the history of popular rock music.

==Early life==
Nicholas Christian Hopkins was born in Perivale, Middlesex, England, on 24 February 1944. He began playing the piano at the age of three. He attended Sudbury Primary School in Perrin Road and Wembley County Grammar School, which now forms part of Alperton Community School, and was initially tutored by a local piano teacher; in his teens he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. He suffered from Crohn&#x27;s disease for most of his life.

His poor health and repeated surgery later made it difficult for him to tour, and he worked mainly as a session musician for most of his career. Hopkins&#x27;s studies were interrupted in 1960 when he left school at 16 to become the pianist with Screaming Lord Sutch&#x27;s Savages until, two years later, he and fellow Savages Bernie Watson, Rick Brown (aka Ricky Fenson) and Carlo Little joined the renowned blues harmonica player Cyril Davies, who had just left Blues Incorporated, and became the Cyril Davies (R&amp;B) All-Stars. Hopkins played piano on their first single, Davies&#x27;s much-admired theme tune &quot;Country Line Special&quot;.

Hopkins was forced to leave the All Stars in May 1963 for a series of operations that almost cost him his life and he was bed-ridden for 19 months in his late teenage years. During his convalescence, Davies died of leukemia and the All Stars disbanded. Hopkins&#x27;s frail health led him to concentrate on working as a session musician instead of joining bands, although he left his mark performing with a wide variety of famous bands. He quickly became one of London&#x27;s most in-demand session pianists and performed on many hit recordings from this period.

==The Rolling Stones==
Hopkins played with the Rolling Stones on all their studio albums from &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; in 1967 through until &quot;Tattoo You&quot; in 1981, except for &quot;Some Girls&quot; (1978). Hopkins first session with a member of the Rolling Stones was on the A Degree of Murder soundtrack, with Brian Jones, in February 1967. Hopkins&#x27; first sessions with the Rolling Stones as a band were also in 1967, from May 17 to 22, where he contributed prominent piano parts on &quot;We Love You&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Rainbow&quot;. Hopkins added further significant piano parts to &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;, &quot;No Expectations&quot;, and &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; (1968), &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot; (1969), &quot;Sway&quot; (1971), &quot;Loving Cup&quot; and &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot; (1972), &quot;Coming Down Again&quot;, &quot;Angie&quot;, and &quot;Winter&quot; (1973), &quot;Time Waits for No One&quot; (1974), &quot;Fool to Cry&quot; (1976), and &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; (recorded 1972, released in 1981). When working with the band during their critical and commercial zenith in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hopkins tended to be employed on a wide range of songs, including ballads, up-tempo rockers and acoustic material; conversely, longtime &quot;de facto&quot; Stones keyboardist Ian Stewart only played on traditional major key blues rock numbers of his choice, while Billy Preston often featured on soul- and funk-influenced tunes. Hopkins&#x27;s work with the Rolling Stones is prominent on their 1972 studio album, &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, where he contributed a variety of musical styles, often playing the main melodic part. Hopkins plays on 14 of the album&#x27;s 18 tracks, giving him a greater presence than full time Rolling Stone Bill Wyman, who only contributed to nine of the songs.

Along with Ry Cooder, Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts, Hopkins released the 1972 album &quot;Jamming with Edward!&quot; It was recorded in 1969, during the Stones&#x27; &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; sessions, when guitarist Keith Richards was not present in the studio. The eponymous &quot;Edward&quot; was an alias of Nicky Hopkins derived from studio banter with Brian Jones. It was also incorporated into the title of Hopkins&#x27;s instrumental song &quot;Edward, the Mad Shirt Grinder&quot;, recorded with Quicksilver Messenger Service and released on &quot;Shady Grove&quot; in December 1969. Hopkins also contributed to the &quot;Jamming With Edward!&quot; cover art.

Hopkins was added to the Rolling Stones touring line-up for the 1971 Good-Bye Britain Tour, as well as the 1972 North American tour and the 1973 Pacific tour.

Hopkins contemplated forming his own band with multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears and drummer Prairie Prince around this time but decided against it after the Stones tour. Hopkins failed to make the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1973 European tour, possibly due to ill health. For the 1989 Steel Wheels tour Hopkins was considered but the band settled for Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford instead, according to Hopkins this was due to insecurities regarding his frail health. After this, aside from a guest appearance in 1978, Hopkins did not play live on stage with the Stones again.

==The Kinks==
Hopkins was invited in 1965 by producer Shel Talmy to record with the Kinks. He played on four of the group&#x27;s studio albums: &quot;The Kink Kontroversy&quot; (1965), &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1966), &quot;Something Else by The Kinks&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; (1968).

The relationship between Hopkins and the Kinks deteriorated after the release of &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;. Hopkins maintained that &quot;about seventy percent&quot; of the keyboard work on the album was his, and was incensed when Ray Davies apparently credited himself with most of the keyboard playing. He was also angered that he was not paid for his session work with the group.

Despite Hopkins&#x27;s grudge against him, Davies spoke positively of his contributions in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview in 1995, shortly after Hopkins&#x27; death. Davies said that Hopkins would &quot;only play when necessary&quot; but still made important differences in the track once it was finally mixed. He also respected Hopkins because of his earlier work, such as playing on &quot;Country Line Special&quot;.

==The Who==
Hopkins was first invited to join the Who by Shel Talmy in 1965, while recording their debut album &quot;My Generation&quot;. His trademark licks and fills bounced effortlessly off the rest of the band and he received a rare songwriting co-credit for the riotous instrumental &quot;The Ox&quot;. Due to the band breaking ties with Shel Talmy, he didn&#x27;t record again with the band until the quirky single &quot;Dogs&quot; in 1968. However he was front and centre for the &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; album in 1971, contributing massively to &quot;Song is Over&quot; and &quot;Getting in Tune&quot;. In addition, during those sessions he played on the single &quot;Let&#x27;s See Action&quot; as well as &quot;Too Much of Anything&quot;. His worth and repute among fellow musicians was such that Pete Townshend offered him a full-time role in the band, though he later couldn&#x27;t remember saying this.

Hopkins missed the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; album, before making a full return in 1975 on &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot;. He was also a key instrumentalist on the soundtrack for Ken Russell&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Tommy&quot;; Townshend had wanted Hopkins to play on the original 1969 album. Hopkins played piano on several tracks and is acknowledged in the album&#x27;s liner notes for his work on arrangements for most of the songs.

In later years Hopkins always maintained a soft spot for the band, stating they were probably his favourite act to work with.

==Solo albums and soundtrack work==
In 1966, Hopkins released &quot;The Revolutionary Piano of Nicky Hopkins&quot;, produced by Shel Talmy. His next solo project released was &quot;The Tin Man Was a Dreamer&quot; in 1973, under the aegis of producer David Briggs. Other musicians appearing on the album include George Harrison (credited as &quot;George O&#x27;Hara&quot;), Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones, and Prairie Prince. The album features a rare case of Hopkins singing lead vocals.

His next solo album, entitled &quot;No More Changes&quot;, was released in 1975. Appearing on the album are Hopkins (lead vocals and all keyboards), David Tedstone (guitars), Michael Kennedy (guitars), Rick Wills (bass), and Eric Dillon (drums and percussion), with back-up vocals from Kathi McDonald, Lea Santo-Robertie, Doug Duffey and Dolly. A third album, &quot;Long Journey Home&quot;, has remained unreleased. He also released three soundtrack albums in Japan between 1992 and 1993, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Patio&quot; and &quot;Namiki Family&quot;.

Hopkins also played on Space Jazz, the official soundtrack to infamous Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s novel, &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; in 1982.

==Other groups==
By the late 1960s, Hopkins was one of Britain&#x27;s best-known session players, particularly through his work with the Rolling Stones and the Kinks. After he accompanied three of the Beatles on Jackie Lomax&#x27;s &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot;, he was invited to play an electric piano solo on the group&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot;, which he did in one take. Further raising his profile, he contributed to the Harry Nilsson album &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot;, and recordings by Donovan.

Hopkins became discontented from just being a session musician, and wanted to tour with a band. In 1968, he joined the Jeff Beck Group. Intended as a vehicle for former Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck, the band also included vocalist Rod Stewart, bassist Ronnie Wood and drummer Micky Waller. He remained with the ensemble through its dissolution in August 1969, performing on &quot;Truth&quot; (1968) and &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; (1969). He composed the instrumental &quot;Girl from Mill Valley&quot; on the latter album. He was reportedly to play in Led Zeppelin when the group formed, but declined the offer. Hopkins also began to record for several San Franciscan groups, including the New Riders of the Purple Sage, the Steve Miller Band and Jefferson Airplane, with whom he recorded the album &quot;Volunteers&quot; and also performed at the Woodstock festival. From 1969 to 1970, Hopkins was a full member of Quicksilver Messenger Service, appearing on &quot;Shady Grove&quot; (1969), &quot;Just for Love&quot; (1970) and &quot;What About Me&quot; (1970). In 1975, he contributed to the &quot;Solid Silver&quot; reunion album as a session musician.
In 1969, Hopkins was a member of the short-lived Sweet Thursday, a quintet comprising Hopkins, Alun Davies (who worked with Cat Stevens), Jon Mark, Harvey Burns and Brian Odgers. The band completed their eponymous debut album; however, their American record label, Tetragrammaton Records, abruptly declared bankruptcy (supposedly the same day the album was released) with promotion and a possible tour never happening.

In August 1975, he joined the Jerry Garcia Band, envisaged as a major creative vehicle for the guitarist during the mid-seventies hiatus of the Grateful Dead. His increasing use of alcohol precipitated several erratic live performances, resulting in him leaving the group by mutual agreement after a 31 December appearance. During 1979–1989, he was playing and touring with Los Angeles-based Night, who had a hit with a cover of Walter Egan&#x27;s &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot;. 

In addition to recording with the Beatles in 1968, Hopkins worked with each of the four when they went solo. He played on several tracks for John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;, (1971) including &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;, which drew praise from the other musicians. Yoko Ono later said Hopkins&#x27; performance was &quot;so melodic and beautiful that it still makes everyone cry, even now.&quot; He also played with George Harrison and Ringo Starr, making key contributions to their respective solo albums , &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; and &quot;Ringo&quot;. He worked only once with Paul McCartney, on the latter&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;.

Hopkins also performed with Graham Parker&#x27;s backing band the Rumour after their keyboardist Bob Andrews left the band.

==Later life==
Hopkins lived in Mill Valley, California, for several years. During this time he worked with several local bands and continued to record in San Francisco. One of his complaints throughout his career was that he did not receive royalties from any of his recording sessions, because of his status at the time as merely a &quot;hired hand&quot;, as opposed to pop stars with agents.

His precarious health, a consequence of Crohn&#x27;s disease and its complications, made touring very difficult, limiting him largely to studio work. Only Quicksilver Messenger Service, through its manager Ron Polte, who went to great lengths to treat his musicians fairly, as well as with assent of the band&#x27;s members, included Hopkins in an ownership stake. Towards the end of his life Hopkins worked as a composer and orchestrator of film scores, with considerable success in Japan.

In the early 1980s, Hopkins credited the Church of Scientology-affiliated Narconon rehabilitation program with curing his drug and alcohol addiction so he ultimately remained a Scientologist for the rest of his life. As a result of his religious affiliation, he contributed to several of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s musical recordings.

In 1993, Hopkins, Joe Walsh, Terry Reid, Rick Rosas, and Phil Jones put together an informal group called The Flew. They played one show at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. This was Hopkins&#x27;s last public performance before his death.

==Death==

Hopkins died on 6 September 1994, at the age of 50, in Nashville, Tennessee, from complications resulting from intestinal surgery related to his lifelong battle with Crohn&#x27;s disease. At the time of his death, he was working on his autobiography with Ray Coleman.

==Legacy and recognition==
Songwriter and musician Julian Dawson collaborated with Hopkins on one recording, the pianist&#x27;s last, in spring 1994, a few months before his death. After Ray Coleman&#x27;s death, the connection led to Dawson working on a definitive biography of Hopkins, first published by Random House in German in 2010, followed in 2011 by the English-language version with the title &quot;And on Piano ... Nicky Hopkins&quot; (a hardback in the UK via Desert Hearts, and a paperback in North America via Backstage Books/Plus One Press).

On 8 September 2018, the Nicky Hopkins &quot;piano&quot; park bench memorial, crowdfunded through PledgeMusic, was unveiled in Perivale Park near Hopkins&#x27; birthplace.

The campaign offered the opportunity for pledgers to have their name inscribed on the bench and contribute towards funding a music scholarship at London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music, where Hopkins himself won a scholarship in the 1950s. Names that have pledged in the campaign include Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood, Bill Wyman, Yoko Ono Lennon, Roger Daltrey, Jimmy Page, Hossam Ramzy, Johnnie Walker and Kenney Jones. A quote about Hopkins by Bob Harris appears on the bench.

On what would have been Hopkins&#x27; 75th birthday (24 February 2019), the Nicky Hopkins Scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music was created, and on 19 October 2019, a commemorative plaque on his childhood home, 38 Jordan Road, Perivale, donated by the Ealing Council and Ealing Civic Society, was unveiled.
==The Session Man documentary==

In 2021, it was announced that a documentary about Nicky&#x27;s life, called &quot;The Session Man&quot;, was in production. The film&#x27;s world premiere opened Doc&#x27;n Roll Film Festival 2023 at The Barbican Centre on 26 October 2023 for which it was nominated for a Doc&#x27;n Roll Jury Award – Best Music Doc of 2023. The film was also screened at the Berlin Independent Film Festival 2024 where it won a Best Low Budget Feature award. The Session Man was digitally released in the USA on demand on November 5, 2024.

<text>Oscar Danilo Blandón Reyes (born July 29, 1951) is a Nicaraguan born drug trafficker who is best known as one of the main subjects of the 1996 newspaper series &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; by reporter Gary Webb.

Blandón was originally a director of agricultural markets in Nicaragua during the government of Anastasio Somoza. When the Somoza regime was overthrown in 1979, Blandón fled to the United States, and then raised money for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN), a Contra group. As part of his fundraising activities Blandón began selling cocaine. Eventually Blandón became a major cocaine trafficker in the Los Angeles area.

In May 1992, Blandón was arrested in San Diego on the federal charge of &quot;conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.&quot; In prison awaiting trial, Blandón began cooperating with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in a number of drug cases. In a plea agreement, Blandón agreed to continue cooperating with the government in exchange for a substantial sentence reduction. Eventually Blandón was sentenced to 48 months. In order to facilitate Blandón&#x27;s work as an informant, the government further requested a reduction in Blandón&#x27;s sentence to time served. Following his imprisonment, Blandón worked for the DEA as a confidential informant. He worked for the DEA to take down drug kingpin Rick Ross in a sting operation, for which Ross was convicted in 1997.

In the 2014 film &quot;Kill the Messenger&quot;, Blandón was portrayed by actor Yul Vazquez.

<text>Metre-gauge railways (US: meter-gauge railways) are narrow-gauge railways with track gauge of or 1 metre.

Metre gauge is used in around of tracks around the world. It was used by several European colonial powers including France, Britain and Germany in their colonies. In Europe, large metre-gauge networks remain in use in Switzerland, Spain and many European towns with urban trams, but most metre-gauge local railways in France, Germany and Belgium closed down in the mid-20th century, although some still remain. With the revival of urban rail transport, metre-gauge light metros were built in some cities. The slightly-wider gauge is used in Sofia, Bulgaria. Another similar gauge is .

<doc id="872297" wikidata="Q1092439" url="?curid=872297" title="List of regions of the Northwest Territories">
<text>The Canadian territory of the Northwest Territories is subdivided into administrative regions in different ways for various purposes.

==Administrative regions==
The Government of the Northwest Territory&#x27;s Department of Municipal and Community Affairs divides the territory into five regions. Other services have adopted similar divisions for administrative purposes, making these the de facto regions of the territory. These divisions have no government of their own, but the Northwest Territories&#x27; government services are decentralized on a regional basis.

Some government departments make slight changes to this arrangement. For example, the Health and Social Services Authority groups Fort Resolution with the North Slave Region, and divides South Slave Region into two regions: Hay River and Fort Smith. The Department of Natural Resources uses the same borders, but calls the Inuvik Region &quot;Beaufort Delta&quot;.


==Indigenous governance regions==
Land and self-government treaties with First Nations, Inuvialuit (Inuit), and Métis groups recognise a significant amount of authority for their governments to manage land use within agreed-upon areas. These areas are each much larger than the area fully owned by the indigenous government. Within each of these areas, the indigenous nation has jurisdiction over several areas of law, and land use is effectively co-governed by the territorial government and indigenous government.

A treaty also exists with the Salt River First Nation, but it establishes reserves rather than a joint land use area.

==Census divisions==

Statistics Canada divides the territory into six census divisions. These areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. They are listed below with their most populous municipality on the right:

*Region 1 – Inuvik
*Region 2 – Norman Wells
*Region 3 – Behchokǫ̀
*Region 4 – Fort Simpson
*Region 5 – Fort Smith
*Region 6 – Yellowknife

===Former census divisions===
====1999-2011====
Prior to the 2011 census, there were two census divisions. The former census division of Inuvik was considerably larger than the administrative region of the same name.
*Fort Smith Region – Fort Smith
*Inuvik Region – Inuvik

====Before 1999====

Prior to the division of the NWT and the creation of Nunavut in 1999, there were five census divisions. Their boundaries were altered somewhat as part of the adjustment.
*Baffin Region
*Fort Smith Region
*Inuvik Region
*Keewatin Region
*Kitikmeot Region

<text>The Canadian territory of Nunavut, which was established in 1999 from the Northwest Territories by the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, is divided into three regions. Though these regions have no governments of their own, Nunavut&#x27;s territorial government services are highly decentralized on a regional basis.

In addition, these regions serve as census divisions for Statistics Canada. Prior to the 2021 Canadian census the Qikiqtaaluk Region and the Kivalliq Region were known as the &quot;Baffin Region&quot; and the &quot;Keewatin Region&quot; to the agency).

It is a misconception that Nunavut&#x27;s regions constitute the former regions of the Northwest Territories (NWT), separated in their entirety. This is not the case, rather, the portions of the regions of the Northwest Territories that ended up in the newly created territory were retained and had their borders slightly adjusted upon the creation of Nunavut.

The regional divisions are distinct from the district system of dividing the Northwest Territories that dated to 1876 and was abolished when Nunavut was created, although for practical purposes had not been used since the 1980s. Nunavut encompasses the entirety of the District of Keewatin (which had differing boundaries from the Keewatin/Kivalliq regions), the majority of the District of Franklin and a small portion of the District of Mackenzie.

<doc id="872306" wikidata="Q13139758" url="?curid=872306" title="Lahore University of Management Sciences">
<text>Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) () is a private research university in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.

In 1984, Syed Babar Ali recognized the shortage of qualified managers in the country. He proposed to establish a world-class university that would attract and retain the highest caliber of students and faculty. He shared this idea with fellow businessman and close friend, Abdul Razak Dawood, who was in full support of the vision. The university has since then expanded, launching a liberal arts undergraduate school in 1994, an engineering school in 2008, a law school in 2004 and an education school in 2017. The university launched a National Outreach Programme (NOP) in 2001 to provide financial aid to students and in 2015, in partnership with Afghan government, launched a scholarship programme for Afghan students to diversify its student body.

As of 2021, the university has a student body of 5,092 graduate and undergraduate students, a faculty of 300 out of which nearly three-quarters have doctoral degrees. Its campus, where more than half of its student population and faculty lives, spreads over 100 acres. Its business school is accredited by Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. It is also one of two business schools in Pakistan to be certified by the South Asian Quality Assurance System and is ranked as one of the top business schools in the country. The university is also a member of Association of Commonwealth Universities.

LUMS is ranked as the top university in Pakistan in the &quot;QS University Rankings&quot; for the year 2016, 111th in Asia and among the top 700 in the world. It is also ranked by &quot;QS&quot; as among the top 250 universities globally for business and among the top 400 universities globally in mathematics. In 2020, LUMS was ranked 40 globally in &quot;World&#x27;s Best Small Universities&quot; by Times Higher Education, being the only Pakistani university on the list. Following a liberal arts curriculum, LUMS is one of Pakistan&#x27;s most expensive, selective and progressive universities. LUMS counts several prominent Pakistani intellectuals and public figures among its alumni and current and former faculty including Umar Saif, Hina Rabbani Khar, Adil Najam, Arif Zaman, Amer Iqbal, Ayesha Jalal, Asad Abidi, Osama Siddique and Pervez Hoodbhoy. It also counts several Fulbright, Chevening and Rhodes scholars among its alumni.

== History ==
The university was granted a charter by the government of Pakistan in March 2023. The LUMS Board of Trustees comprises members of the domestic business community, academics and government representatives. The principal functions of the board are to set policy guidelines and to review the operations of the university. The Board of Governors, as the sponsor of LUMS, raises funds for the university&#x27;s operation and maintenance. In 1986, a business school by the name of Lahore Business School was established for an MBA Programme. Later the school was renamed and is known as Suleman Dawood School of Business.

After the construction of the current campus, LUMS started undergraduate programmes in Economics and Computer Sciences in 1994. In 1996, the School of Arts and Science was introduced to oversee the undergraduate programmes.

For the year 2021–2022, the per credit hour tuition fee was Rs. 23,760.

LUMS launched the National Outreach Programme (NOP) in 2001 to reach out to bright students from underprivileged areas of Pakistan. Under this initiative, induction of selected candidates into the academic programs is facilitated by preparation for the university&#x27;s admission criteria and then by a provision of full financial assistance to those who qualify. Many students are admitted to LUMS on the basis of the NOP. There are very few number of scholarships that are offered on need/academic achievement basis. LUMS loan scheme covers 20%-100% of the tuition fee component of the student. LUMS loans are interest-free.

According to LUMS, it has disbursed PKR 3.2 billion in financial assistance, with approximately 30% of the student body receiving some form of financial assistance each year. During the academic year 2015-16 alone, LUMS disbursed more than PKR 500 Million as financial aid to its students. As of 2016, more than 800 scholars have benefited from the LUMS National Outreach Programme (NOP). In 2017, the Shahid Hussain Foundation established scholarships for international undergraduate students from South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation member countries.

<doc id="872313" wikidata="Q1323551" url="?curid=872313" title="Robley D. Evans (admiral)">
<text>Robley Dunglison Evans (18 August 1846 – 3 January 1912), born in Floyd County, Virginia, was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, who served from the American Civil War to the Spanish–American War. In 1907–1908, he commanded the Great White Fleet on its worldwide cruise from the Atlantic Ocean through the Straits of Magellan to the Pacific Ocean.

==Naval service==
In 1859, Utah Territory delegate William Henry Hooper offered Evans the territory&#x27;s nomination to the United States Naval Academy. After establishing residency in Utah, he entered the academy in 1860. Evans was ordered to active duty in September 1863 and graduated from the academy in the class of 1864.

===American Civil War service===
In the attacks on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, he exhibited great gallantry under fire on 15 January 1865. He led his landing party of United States Marines through heavy fire to charge the Confederate defenses. Evans continued to fight even after his fourth wound, drawing his pistol and threatening to kill any man who attempted to amputate his leg in surgery when he was evacuated.

===&quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Evans===
Evans held numerous important sea commands during the 1890s. In 1891 and 1892, commanding &quot;Yorktown&quot; on the Pacific Squadron, he won great acclaim for his firm and skillful handling of a tense situation with Chile, becoming known as &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Evans. Though he evidently took pride in his nickname, his reputation for profanity also led to his being chastised by Leonard Woolsey Bacon, pastor of the Congregational Church in Litchfield, Connecticut, in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===USS &quot;Indiana&quot;===
The United States&#x27; first seagoing battleship, USS &quot;Indiana&quot;, was placed in commission on 20 November 1895, with Captain Evans in command. Former President Benjamin Harrison, with a committee from the state of Indiana, presented a set of silver to Evans for the battleship on 16 September 1896 at Tompkinsville, New York.

===Spanish–American War service===
During the Spanish–American War, he commanded the battleship in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.

===Shore duty===
Robley Dunglison Evans was named president of the Board of Inspection and Survey from February 1901 to April 1902.

===Prince Henry of Prussia===
President Theodore Roosevelt selected Admiral Robley D. Evans to host Prince Heinrich of Prussia, brother of Germany&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm II. 15 February 1902, Admiral Evans, as Commander-in-Chief of a special honor squadron, hoisted his flag on the battleship at the New York Navy Yard. Evans feted Prince Henry during the visit of the Kaiserliche Marine Imperial German Navy. After the departure of the German prince, 28 February 1902, Evans&#x27; flag was hauled down on &quot;Illinois&quot;.

===Commander-in-Chief – Asiatic Fleet===
Admiral Evans transferred his flag from armored cruiser, on 4 November 1902 to battleship, at Yokohama, Japan. On 5 December 1903, the &quot;Kentucky&quot; left Japanese waters for Hawaii; on 17 December 1903, the &quot;Kentucky&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor Naval Station, Hawaii. Admiral Evans hosted a Christmas dinner for the officers of&quot; Kentucky&quot; at the Moana Hotel in Waikiki. 31 December 1903 Evans&#x27; flagship departed Honolulu for Guam. &quot;Kentucky&quot; arrived in Cavite, the Philippines, on 18 January 1904. Admiral Evans called on the new Governor-General of the Philippines, Luke Edward Wright, at the Malacanang Palace. Evans&#x27; flagship departed Manila on 13 March 1904. The &quot;Kentucky&quot; coaled at Hong Kong and Colombo. Sailing through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea to the port of Naples, Italy, the voyage continued to Gibraltar, coaling at Madeira; the flagship &quot;Kentucky&quot; arrived at the New York Navy Yard, 23 May 1904. Admiral Evans hauled down his flag, 27 May 1904 from battleship &quot;Kentucky&quot;.

===Commander-in-Chief – North Atlantic Fleet===
On 31 March 1905, a 13-gun salute was fired by the battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot; at Pensacola, Florida, as the flag of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans, Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Fleet, was broken at the main mast. The fleet sailed on 7 May 1905 for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Admiral Evans returned to his alma mater the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, on 30 October 1905.

The British Fleet under command of Prince Louis of Battenberg arrived at Annapolis. On 1 November 1905, the Prince visited Evans on &quot;Maine&quot;. Admiral Evans gave Prince Louis a tour of the Naval Academy and battleship &quot;Maine&quot;. A reception by Evans was held later in the week on the &quot;Maine&quot; for Governor Edwin Warfield of Maryland.

Admiral Evans on the flagship &quot;Maine&quot; sailed on 7 November 1905 from Annapolis to New York. Admiral Evans stayed on board &quot;Maine&quot; during repairs from 20 November 1905 to January 1906. After winter quarters in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 3 May 1906, Evans returned the fleet to New York. On 2 September 1906, the &quot;Maine&quot; anchored next to the presidential yacht &quot;Mayflower&quot; off Oyster Bay, Long Island. President Theodore Roosevelt came on board &quot;Maine&quot; to confer with Evans. Admiral Evans on the &quot;Maine&quot; departed New York on 28 December for winter quarters in Cuban waters. On 15 April 1907, Evans&#x27; flagship &quot;Maine&quot; returned to Hampton Roads. On 16 April 1907, Evans hauled down his flag on the &quot;Maine&quot; and then hoisted it on the battleship &quot;Connecticut&quot;, flagship for the world cruise.

===The Great White Fleet===
Rear Admiral Evans commanded the Great White Fleet 16 April 1907 from Hampton Roads, Virginia, in its passage from the Atlantic Ocean through the Straits of Magellan to the Pacific Ocean, where he was relieved of command in San Francisco, California, 9 May 1908, because of ill health.

Admiral Evans retired from the Navy upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 62 on 18 August 1908.

He died in Washington, DC, on 3 January 1912.

==Honors==
Rear Admiral Evans was entitled to the Civil War Campaign Medal, Sampson Medal, and Spanish Campaign Medal.
Two destroyers, USS &quot;Evans&quot; (DD-78), launched 30 October 1918, and USS &quot;Evans&quot; (DD-552), launched 4 October 1942, were named in his honor.

Evans Avenue in San Francisco is named for him.

<doc id="872314" wikidata="Q2294564" url="?curid=872314" title="Darboux integral">
<text>In real analysis, the Darboux integral is constructed using Darboux sums and is one possible definition of the integral of a function. Darboux integrals are equivalent to Riemann integrals, meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable, and the values of the two integrals, if they exist, are equal. The definition of the Darboux integral has the advantage of being easier to apply in computations or proofs than that of the Riemann integral. Consequently, introductory textbooks on calculus and real analysis often develop Riemann integration using the Darboux integral, rather than the true Riemann integral. Moreover, the definition is readily extended to defining Riemann–Stieltjes integration. Darboux integrals are named after their inventor, Gaston Darboux (1842–1917).

==Definition==
The definition of the Darboux integral considers upper and lower (Darboux) integrals, which exist for any bounded real-valued function formula_1 on the interval formula_2 The Darboux integral exists if and only if the upper and lower integrals are equal. The upper and lower integrals are in turn the infimum and supremum, respectively, of upper and lower (Darboux) sums which over- and underestimate, respectively, the &quot;area under the curve.&quot; In particular, for a given partition of the interval of integration, the upper and lower sums add together the areas of rectangular slices whose heights are the supremum and infimum, respectively, of &quot;f&quot; in each subinterval of the partition. These ideas are made precise below:

===Darboux sums===

A partition of an interval formula_3 is a finite sequence of values formula_4 such that

:formula_5

Each interval formula_6 is called a &quot;subinterval&quot; of the partition. Let formula_7 be a bounded function, and let

:formula_8

be a partition of formula_3. Let

:formula_10
The upper Darboux sum of formula_1 with respect to formula_12 is

:formula_13

The lower Darboux sum of formula_1 with respect to formula_12 is

:formula_16

The lower and upper Darboux sums are often called the lower and upper sums.

===Darboux integrals===
The upper Darboux integral of &quot;f&quot; is

:formula_17

The lower Darboux integral of &quot;f&quot; is

:formula_18

In some literature, an integral symbol with an underline and overline represent the lower and upper Darboux integrals respectively:

:formula_19

and like Darboux sums they are sometimes simply called the &quot;lower and upper integrals&quot;.

If &quot;U&quot;&quot;f&quot; = &quot;L&quot;&quot;f&quot;, then we call the common value the &quot;Darboux integral&quot;. We also say that &quot;f&quot; is &quot;Darboux-integrable&quot; or simply &quot;integrable&quot; and set

:formula_20

An equivalent and sometimes useful criterion for the integrability of &quot;f&quot; is to show that for every ε &gt; 0 there exists a partition &quot;P&quot;ε of [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] such that

:formula_21

==Properties==
*For any given partition, the upper Darboux sum is always greater than or equal to the lower Darboux sum. Furthermore, the lower Darboux sum is bounded below by the rectangle of width (&quot;b&quot;−&quot;a&quot;) and height inf(&quot;f&quot;) taken over [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. Likewise, the upper sum is bounded above by the rectangle of width (&quot;b&quot;−&quot;a&quot;) and height sup(&quot;f&quot;).
*:formula_22
*The lower and upper Darboux integrals satisfy
*:formula_23
*Given any &quot;c&quot; in (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)
*:formula_24
*The lower and upper Darboux integrals are not necessarily linear. Suppose that &quot;g&quot;:[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → R is also a bounded function, then the upper and lower integrals satisfy the following inequalities:
*:formula_25
*For a constant &quot;c&quot; ≥ 0 we have
*:formula_26
*For a constant &quot;c&quot; ≤ 0 we have
*:formula_27
*Consider the function
*:formula_28
:then &quot;F&quot; is Lipschitz continuous. An identical result holds if &quot;F&quot; is defined using an upper Darboux integral.

==Examples==

===A Darboux-integrable function===
Suppose we want to show that the function formula_29 is Darboux-integrable on the interval formula_30 and determine its value. To do this we partition formula_30 into formula_32 equally sized subintervals each of length formula_33. We denote a partition of formula_32 equally sized subintervals as formula_35.

Now since formula_29 is strictly increasing on formula_30, the infimum on any particular subinterval is given by its starting point. Likewise the supremum on any particular subinterval is given by its end point. The starting point of the formula_38-th subinterval in formula_35 is formula_40 and the end point is formula_41. Thus the lower Darboux sum on a partition formula_35 is given by

:formula_43

similarly, the upper Darboux sum is given by

:formula_44

Since
:formula_45
Thus for given any formula_46, we have that any partition formula_35 with formula_48 satisfies 
:formula_49
which shows that formula_1 is Darboux integrable. To find the value of the integral note that

:formula_51
===A nonintegrable function===
Suppose we have the Dirichlet function formula_52 defined as 

:formula_53

Since the rational and irrational numbers are both dense subsets of formula_54, it follows that formula_1 takes on the value of 0 and 1 on every subinterval of any partition. Thus for any partition formula_12 we have

:formula_57
from which we can see that the lower and upper Darboux integrals are unequal.

==Refinement of a partition and relation to Riemann integration==

A &quot;refinement&quot; of the partition formula_58 is a partition formula_59 such that for all &quot;i&quot; = 0, …, &quot;n&quot; there is an integer &quot;r&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) such that

:formula_60

In other words, to make a refinement, cut the subintervals into smaller pieces and do not remove any existing cuts.

If formula_61 is a refinement of formula_62 then

:formula_63

and

:formula_64

If &quot;P&quot;1, &quot;P&quot;2 are two partitions of the same interval (one need not be a refinement of the other), then

:formula_65

and it follows that

:formula_66

Riemann sums always lie between the corresponding lower and upper Darboux sums. Formally, if formula_67 and formula_68 together make a tagged partition

:formula_69

(as in the definition of the Riemann integral), and if the Riemann sum of formula_1 is equal to formula_71 corresponding to &quot;P&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, then

:formula_72

From the previous fact, Riemann integrals are at least as strong as Darboux integrals: if the Darboux integral exists, then the upper and lower Darboux sums corresponding to a sufficiently fine partition will be close to the value of the integral, so any Riemann sum over the same partition will also be close to the value of the integral. There is (see below) a tagged partition that comes arbitrarily close to the value of the upper Darboux integral or lower Darboux integral, and consequently, if the Riemann integral exists, then the Darboux integral must exist as well.

<doc id="872322" wikidata="Q333974" url="?curid=872322" title="Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun">
<text>Arthur Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun, (1 November 1840 – 20 January 1915), styled Sir Arthur Guinness, Bt between 1868 and 1880, was an Anglo-Irish businessman, politician and philanthropist. He is perhaps best known for giving St Stephen&#x27;s Green to the Dublin Corporation for public use.
==Background and education==
Guinness was born at St Anne&#x27;s, Clontarf, Dublin, the eldest son of Sir Benjamin Guinness, 1st Baronet, and elder brother of Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh. He was the great-grandson of Arthur Guinness. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1862, and in 1868 succeeded his father as the second Baronet Guinness of Ashford.

==Political life==

In 1868 Guinness was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for the City of Dublin, a seat he held for only a year. His election was voided because of his election agent&#x27;s unlawful efforts, which the court found were unknown to him. He was re-elected at the next election in 1874.

A supporter of Disraeli&#x27;s &quot;one nation&quot; conservatism, his politics were typical of &quot;constructive unionism&quot;, the belief that the union between Ireland and Britain should be more beneficial to the people of Ireland after centuries of difficulties. In 1872 he was a sponsor of the &quot;Irish Exhibition&quot; at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin, which was arranged to promote Irish trade. Correcting a mistake about the exhibition in the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot; led to a death threat from a religious extremist, which he did not report to the police. In the 1890s he supported the Irish Unionist Alliance.

After withdrawing from the Guinness company in 1876, when he sold his half-share to his brother Edward for £600,000, he was in 1880 raised to the peerage as Baron Ardilaun, of Ashford in the County of Galway. His home there was at Ashford Castle on Lough Corrib, and his title derived from the Gaelic &quot;Ard Oileáin&quot;, a &#x27;high island&#x27; on the lake.

==Landlord==
In 1852, Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, 1st Baronet (1798–1868), heir to the Guinness brewery fortune and father of Arthur Guinness, &quot;acquired several Connacht estates that were up for sale in the Encumbered Estates&#x27; Court. He bought the Ashford estate from Lord Oranmore and Browne, the Doon estate from Sir Richard O&#x27;Donnell, the Cong estate from Alexander Lambert, part of the Rosshill estate from Lords Charlemont and Leitrim, parts of Connemara from Christopher St George. In 1859, he bought Kylemore from a banking consortium. With these purchases, Benjamin Guinness became landlord to 670 tenants, 316 of whom rented at less than £5 per annum. With his father’s death in 1868, Arthur Guinness, 2nd Baronet and oldest son and heir, continued in his father’s footsteps, purchasing vast swaths of Galway. &quot;He bought the Elwood estate of Strandhill, just across the river from Ashford, Cong, in 1871, and Lord Kilmaine sold him the Inishdoorus islands on Lough Corrib, and lands in the barony of Ross, part of Nymphsfield near Cong in 1875. William Burke of Lisloughry was his agent&quot;. When Arthur&#x27;s acquisitions were combined with those of his father, total acreage for the Ashford estate was 33,298 with the result that Lord Ardilaun owned most of County Galway between Maam (Maum) Bridge and Lough Mask.

Owning 31,000 acres recently bought by his father or himself in Counties Galway and Mayo, Ardilaun was placed in a difficult and unusual position during the Land War of the 1880s. Tenant farmers had started rent strikes and boycotting against absentee landlords who cared little about their estates. In contrast, Ardilaun lived at Ashford for much of the year, and invested heavily in his lands, but was forced to sell land from the 1880s and saw two of his bailiffs assassinated in what became known as the Lough Mask Murders in January 1882. His attempt to preserve the landscape at Muckross, near Killarney, County Kerry, from 1899 for aesthetic reasons was under challenge as soon as 1905. With the Digby family he was a joint owner of the Aran Islands that were compulsorily purchased by the Congested Districts Board in 1916.

==Philanthropy==
Ardilaun was, like many in the Guinness family, a generous philanthropist, devoting himself to a number of public causes, including the restoration of Marsh&#x27;s Library in Dublin and the extension of the city&#x27;s Coombe Women&#x27;s Hospital. In buying and keeping intact the estate around Muckross House in 1899, he assisted the movement to preserve the lake and mountain landscape around Killarney, now a major tourist destination. From 1875 he was a sponsor of the &quot;Dublin Artizan&#x27;s Dwellings Company&quot;, which built cottages for poor Dubliners at reasonable rents, and was the forerunner of the Iveagh Trust later set up by his brother Edward.

In his best-known achievement, he also bought, landscaped, and gave to the capital, the central public park of St Stephen&#x27;s Green, where his statue commissioned by the city can be seen opposite the Royal College of Surgeons. To do so he sponsored a Private bill that was passed as the &quot;Saint Stephen’s Green (Dublin) Act 1877&quot;, and after the landscaping it was formally opened to the public on 27 July 1880. It has been maintained since then by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland (now the Office of Public Works)

In 1913 Ardilaun was approached by Sir Hugh Lane, who wanted to build a new modern art gallery in the Green where the statue of Lord Ardilaun was placed. Ardilaun replied:
:&quot;Are you mad? I will not have myself stand sentry to a picture palace like some giddy huckster&quot;.

An intermission in Ardilaun&#x27;s philanthropy provoked Yeats&#x27;s powerful poem &quot;To a Wealthy Man...&quot;

He was also elected President of the Royal Dublin Society from 1892 to 1913.

==In &quot;Ulysses&quot;==
&quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce includes several references to Ardilaun, as Joyce considered him to be a prime Irish example of Victorian conventional respectability. The porter brewed by the &quot;cunning brothers&quot;—he and his brother Lord Iveagh—was: &quot;a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.&quot; In the &quot;Nighttown&quot; section, the breasts of a girl who is undressing are &quot;Two ardilauns&quot;, meaning &quot;two high islands&quot;, a play on the Gaelic meaning of the word.

In 1902-03 Joyce also wrote literary reviews in the Irish &quot;Daily Express&quot; which was owned by Ardilaun.

==Personal life==

In 1871, Lord Ardilaun married Lady Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White, daughter of The 3rd Earl of Bantry, whose family seat was Bantry House in County Cork; this was a happy but childless marriage.

He died on 20 January 1915 at his home at St Anne&#x27;s, Raheny, and was buried at All Saints Church, Raheny, whose construction he had sponsored. Those present at the funeral included representatives of the Royal Dublin Society, of which Lord Ardilaun was president for many years, the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland, the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Primrose League. His barony became extinct at his death, but the baronetcy devolved upon his nephew Algernon.

On his widow&#x27;s death Saint Anne&#x27;s Park passed to Algernon&#x27;s cousin Rev. Benjamin Plunket former Bishop of Meath, who sold most of the estate to Dublin Corporation in 1937, keeping Sybil Hill as his residence. The corporation has preserved much of the estate as one of Dublin&#x27;s most important public parks, though the house itself burnt down in 1943, with the remaining lands used for housing. The outcome of Ardilaun&#x27;s extensive tree plantings came into focus a century after his death, when in 2019 the park was given Green Flag status, and was listed as one of the world&#x27;s top five urban public parks.

<doc id="872328" wikidata="Q4156959" url="?curid=872328" title="Decartelization">
<text>Decartelization is the transition of a national economy from monopoly control by groups of large businesses, known as cartels, to a free market economy. This change rarely arises naturally, and is generally the result of regulation by a governing body with the authority to decide what structures are permissible.

A modern example of decartelization is the economic restructuring of Germany after the fall of the Third Reich in 1945.
To truly understand the term &quot;decartelization&quot; requires familiarity with the term &quot;cartel&quot;. A cartel is a formal (explicit) agreement among firms. Cartels usually occur in an oligopolistic industry (oligopoly), where there are a small number of sellers, and usually involve homogeneous products (see Homogeneity and heterogeneity). Cartel members may agree on such matters as price fixing, total industry output, market shares, allocation of customers, allocation of territories, bid rigging, establishment of common sales agencies (sales agents), and the division of property or profits or combination of these. The aim of such collusion is to increase individual member&#x27;s profits by reducing competition. Competition laws forbid cartels. Identifying and breaking up cartels is an important part of competition policy in most countries, although proving the existence of a cartel is rarely easy, as firms are usually not so careless as to put agreements to collude on paper.

==Historical background==

Examples of alleged and legal cartels:
*American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) controlled all telephone systems in the United States via a network of subsidiaries, the Bell System, which was broken up in 1982.
*De Beers settled charges of price fixing in the diamond trade in the 2000s. (See De Beers antitrust litigation.)

==Debate==

The general debate with decartelization is a national economy controlled by monopolies and cartels, versus a free market economy. With a free market economy, the pros are very clear. It encourages individual initiatives; it determines price of goods through competition, and motivates people to work towards financial independence. Most individuals would prefer a free market economy, where there are many buyers and sellers in each market, and the prices are determined based on competition alone. The problem is, it is not up to the individuals. In most cases of cartels, these secret arrangements are done &quot;under the radar&quot;, and these major companies know how to cover their tracks. It is very difficult to prove that companies have formed a cartel; therefore it is very difficult to dismantle one.

In the case with the Third Reich in Germany, the people had no choice. During the war, there was a school called , the &quot;social conscience free market&quot;. Members of this school hated totalitarianism and had propounded their views at some risk during the Nazis&#x27; rule. Wrote Henry Wallich, &quot;During the Nazi Reich period the school represented a kind of intellectual resistance movement, requiring great personal courage as well as independence of mind.&quot; The school&#x27;s members believed in free markets, along with some slight degree of progression in the income tax system and government action to limit monopoly.

<doc id="872329" wikidata="Q5541766" url="?curid=872329" title="George Little (naval officer)">
<text>George Little (10 April 1754 – 22 July 1809) was a United States Navy officer. He served in the Massachusetts State Navy during the Revolutionary War and in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France.

==Military career==
At age 25, Little was appointed first lieutenant of Massachusetts ship &quot;Protector&quot; in 1779, and was aboard in 1781 when she fought a running battle with the British ship &quot;Thames&quot;. In a later engagement, he was captured, imprisoned, but later escaped.

He was given command of Massachusetts ship &quot;Winthrop&quot; which captured two British privateers, armed brig &quot;Meriam&quot;, and a number of other vessels. Commissioned captain, USN, 4 March 1799, Little was given command of the frigate &quot;Boston&quot;, which was still under construction. At the end of June, Capt. Little served as member of the first U.S. Navy court martial, that of John Blake Cordis, second lieutenant of the &quot;Constitution&quot; and brother-in-law of Little&#x27;s first lieutenant, Robert Haswell. The &quot;Boston&quot; sailed 24 July, on the first of two cruises down the American coast to the West Indies. The next year saw a second cruise, which culminated with the capture of the French corvette &quot;Le Berceau&quot; and seven other ships.

On their return, Little found himself in the middle of a political firestorm, the capture of &quot;Le Berceau&quot; having taken place two weeks after the signing of the Treaty of Mortefontaine had ended the Quasi-War. He and his fellow officers faced a court martial for the alleged looting of the personal possessions of the French officers, of which they would be acquitted but not without Little being dismissed by the Navy in 1801. This was not his only legal fight, as a challenge to the legitimacy of the taking of the Danish trader, the &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, would result in a legal case which, as &quot;Little v. Barreme&quot;, was heard by the United States Supreme Court in 1804, the ruling going against Little. Little also fought in court over an agreement with Silas Talbot to split the prize money for &quot;Les Deux Anges&quot;, taken by the &quot;Boston&quot; in January 1800. This case, &quot;Talbot v. Little&quot;, also reached the Supreme Court, but was eventually dismissed without hearing, leaving Little and his crew the victors.

==Namesakes==
Two destroyers have been named USS &quot;Little&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="872331" wikidata="Q374900" url="?curid=872331" title="Kenneth Tynan">
<text>Kenneth Peacock Tynan (2 April 1927 – 26 July 1980) was an English theatre critic and writer. Initially making his mark as a critic at &quot;The Observer&quot;, he praised John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) and encouraged the emerging wave of British theatrical talent.

In 1963, Tynan was appointed the new National Theatre Company&#x27;s literary manager.

An opponent of theatre censorship, he was the first person to deliberately say the word &quot;fuck&quot; during a live television broadcast in 1965, although Miriam Margolyes had earlier used the expletive accidentally.

Later in life, he settled in California, where he resumed his writing career.

==Early life==
Tynan was born in Birmingham, England, to Letitia Rose Tynan and (as he was led to believe) &quot;Peter Tynan&quot; (see below). Tynan had a stammer that was more pronounced as a child. He also possessed early on a high degree of articulate intelligence. By the age of six, he was already keeping a diary. At King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, he was a brilliant student of whom one of his masters said: &quot;He was the only boy I could never teach anything.&quot; He played the lead, Doctor Parpalaid, in an English translation of Jules Romains&#x27;s farce &quot;Knock&quot;. While at school, Tynan began smoking, which became a lifelong habit.

Tynan was twelve at the outbreak of the Second World War. At thirteen, he was nearly killed when a parachute landmine destroyed the houses on the other side of the Birmingham street where the Tynans lived, killing the inhabitants.

He adopted opinions then deemed outrageous. During school debates, he advocated repealing laws against homosexuality and abortion. During a school debate on the motion &quot;This House Thinks the Present Generation Has Lost the Ability to Entertain Itself&quot;, Tynan gave a speech on the pleasures of masturbation. By the time the war ended, he had gained a scholarship to Oxford University.

===Oxford and other experiences===
At Magdalen College, Oxford, Tynan lived flamboyantly but was already beginning to suffer from the effects of his heavy smoking.

The writer Paul Johnson, &quot;an awestruck freshman-witness to his arrival at the Magdalen lodge&quot;, described Tynan as a &quot;tall, beautiful, epicene youth, with pale yellow locks, Beardsley cheekbones, fashionable stammer, plum-coloured suit, lavender tie and ruby signet-ring.&quot; According to Johnson, most students were &quot;struck speechless&quot; by Tynan&#x27;s extravagant style.

Disliked by some, Tynan was an intellectual and social leader among Oxford undergraduates, often made a splash (&quot;during the whole of his time there he was easily the most talked-of person in the city&quot;), had groupies (&quot;a court of young women and admiring dons&quot;), and gave sensational parties sometimes attended by London entertainment celebrities, Johnson wrote.

Tynan produced and acted in plays, spoke &quot;brilliantly&quot; at the Oxford Union, wrote for and edited college magazines. He retained a lifelong admiration for his tutor at Oxford, C. S. Lewis; in spite of their marked differences in outlook, Tynan viewed him as a father figure.

In 1948, after the death of his father—the man he had known as Peter Tynan—Tynan learned that &quot;Peter Tynan&quot; was in reality an alias of Sir Peter Peacock, a former mayor of Warrington, who had been leading a double life for more than 20 years, and who had a wife and another family in Warrington. Tynan&#x27;s mother was obliged to return Sir Peter&#x27;s body to his wife and family in Warrington for burial. Tynan&#x27;s discovery of his father&#x27;s deception (and his mother&#x27;s collusion) severely damaged his ability to trust others.

When Tynan was called up for National Service, he put on an act of appearing outrageously camp, including wearing a floppy hat, velvet coat, painted fingernails and a great deal of Yardley scent. Perhaps partly as a result, he was rejected as &quot;medically unfit&quot; for service.

==Career==

===1951 to the early 1960s===
On 25 January 1951, Tynan married the American author Elaine Dundy after a three-month romance. The following year, their daughter, Tracy (born 12 May 1952, Westminster, London), was named after the character in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, Tracy Lord, played by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn was asked to be the child&#x27;s godmother, a role she accepted.

Tynan&#x27;s career took off in 1952 when he was hired as a theatre critic for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. According to Johnson, Tynan &quot;quickly established himself as the most audacious literary journalist in London. His motto was: &#x27;Write heresy, pure heresy.&#x27; He pinned to his desk the exhilarating slogan: &#x27;Rouse tempers, goad and lacerate, raise whirlwinds. Two years later, he left for &quot;The Observer&quot;, and it was there that he rose to prominence (1954–1958, 1960–1963).

Tynan was highly critical of what he called &quot;the Loamshire play&quot;, a genre of English country house drama he felt dominated the early 1950s British stage and was wasting the talents of playwrights and actors. He espoused a new theatrical realism, best exemplified in the works of the playwrights who became known as the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot;. There was a significant development in the 1955–56 British theatre season during which John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (and Samuel Beckett&#x27;s English version of his own &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;) premiered. Tynan championed Osborne&#x27;s play, although he identified some possible flaws, concluding his review with the comment: &quot;I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;. It is the best young play of its decade.&quot; The theatre historian Dan Rebellato asserts: &quot;it is clear that he is set on confronting his readership, not speaking for them&quot;.

&quot;He became a power in the London theatre, which regarded him with awe, fear and hatred&quot;, Johnson wrote. The reviewer &quot;seemed to know all world literature&quot; and studded his articles with such words as &quot;esurient&quot;, &quot;cateran&quot;, &quot;cisisbeism&quot; [sic], and &quot;erethism&quot;.

Tynan and the actor Harold Lang co-wrote a radio play, &quot;The Quest for Corbett&quot; (1956), which was broadcast at least twice in the BBC Third Programme in the mid-1950s. From 1956 to 1958, Tynan was the script editor for Ealing Studios, and co-wrote, with Seth Holt, the film &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot; (1958). Tynan commissioned a film adaptation of William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; from Nigel Kneale, but Ealing Studios closed in 1959 before it could be produced.

From 1958 to 1960, Tynan became known in the United States by contributing &quot;some superb reviews&quot; to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His marriage had become increasingly difficult in spite of his success (and Dundy&#x27;s: she had published her first novel in 1958). Both had extramarital affairs (his much more blatant than hers) and he had developed a dependence on alcohol. His sexual tastes had always favoured sadomasochism, which strained the marriage as well. Dundy wrote in her memoir &quot;Life Itself&quot; (2002): &quot;To cane a woman on her bare buttocks, to hurt and humiliate her, was what gave him his greatest sexual satisfaction.&quot; Johnson wrote that &quot;women seem to have objected less to his sadism, which took only a mild form, than to his vanity and authoritarianism. [...] He treated women as possessions. [...] Tynan, while reserving the unqualified right to be unfaithful himself, expected loyalty from his spouse.&quot; On one occasion, he returned from a meeting with his mistress to find a naked man in the kitchen with his wife. He threw the man&#x27;s clothes down a lift shaft.

After his first period writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Tynan returned in 1960 to &quot;The Observer&quot;, where he remained its theatre critic until mid-1963, when he joined the National Theatre Company.

Tyan was a supporter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. In 1964 Tynan joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

===At the National Theatre===
In 1963, Laurence Olivier became the British National Theatre Company&#x27;s first artistic director. Tynan had been highly dismissive of Olivier&#x27;s achievements as artistic director of the Chichester Festival Theatre, which opened in 1962, but he recommended himself for the role of literary manager. Olivier was initially outraged by Tynan&#x27;s presumption but Olivier&#x27;s wife, Joan Plowright, convinced him that Tynan would be an asset at the National Theatre Company, then based at the Old Vic theatre. When he became the National Theatre&#x27;s literary manager, Tynan ceased to be the theatre critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;, but he stayed on the paper for several more years as a film reviewer.

At the National Theatre, Tynan established for himself a global reputation, Johnson wrote: &quot;Indeed at times in the 1960s he probably had more influence than anyone else in world theatre.&quot; Tynan in particular played an important role in the National&#x27;s choice of plays, pushing Olivier into more adventurous selections than his own instincts might have led him to. Altogether, some 79 plays were performed during Tynan&#x27;s period at the National Theatre; 32 were his idea, and another 20 chosen with his collaboration. Tynan also persuaded Olivier to play the title role in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;, something the actor had always been reluctant to do: Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; opened at the National Theatre in 1964 to glowing reviews, and was filmed in 1965.

On 13 November 1965, Tynan participated in a live TV debate, broadcast as part of the BBC&#x27;s late-night satirical show &quot;BBC-3&quot;. He was asked whether he would allow a play to be staged in which sexual intercourse was represented on the stage, and replied: &quot;Well, I think so, certainly. I doubt if there are any rational people to whom the word &#x27;fuck&#x27; would be particularly diabolical, revolting or totally forbidden. I think that anything which can be printed or said can also be seen.&quot; No recording survives of the programme. At the time, this was believed to be the first time the word &quot;fuck&quot; had been spoken on British television—although at least three prior claims have been asserted: Brendan Behan on &quot;Panorama&quot; in 1956 (although his drunken slurring was not understood); an anonymous man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the River Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV&#x27;s magazine show, &quot;Roundabout&quot;, that his job was &quot;fucking boring&quot;; and the actress Miriam Margolyes, who claims to have used the word in frustration while appearing on &quot;University Challenge&quot; in 1963. Johnson later called Tynan&#x27;s use of the word &quot;his masterpiece of calculated self-publicity&quot;, adding, &quot;for a time it made him the most notorious man in the country&quot;. &quot;Private Eye&quot; joked that Tynan&#x27;s stammer made it the first three-syllable four-letter word on British television.

In response to public outcry, the BBC was forced to issue a formal apology. In the House of Commons, four censuring motions were signed by a total of 133 Labour and Conservative backbenchers. Mary Whitehouse, a frequent critic of the BBC over issues of &quot;morals and decency&quot;, wrote a letter to the Queen, suggesting that Tynan should be reprimanded by having &quot;his bottom spanked&quot;. The irony of Whitehouse&#x27;s comment has been noted, given the later revelations of Tynan&#x27;s fetish for flagellation.

Tynan&#x27;s use of the four-letter word appears in a song by comedian Billy Connolly entitled &quot;Four Letter Word&quot;.

The controversy was part of a larger, longstanding aim of Tynan&#x27;s &quot;of breaking down linguistic inhibitions on the stage and in print. In 1960, &quot;after much manoeuvring&quot;, Tynan got the four-letter word into &quot;The Observer&quot; in an article about the Lady Chatterley trial. His organisation of &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; in 1969 was another important victory in that campaign. Tynan fiercely opposed censorship and was determined to break taboos he considered arbitrary.

Tynan&#x27;s left-wing politics and lifestyle made him something of a poster boy for 1960s radical chic and champagne socialism in London. He suffered a serious personal defeat in the National&#x27;s internal battles over his support for the Rolf Hochhuth play &quot;Soldiers&quot;, a controversial work highly critical of Winston Churchill, whose National Theatre production was eventually cancelled.

==Later career==
An erotic revue that Tynan coordinated and partly wrote, &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, debuted in 1969 and became one of the most successful theatre hits of all time. It included scenes by various authors, including Samuel Beckett, Sam Shepard, John Lennon and Edna O&#x27;Brien, as well as music and featured frequent nudity. But Tynan was a poor businessman, and the contracts he signed for the show brought him only $250,000 out of the many millions it earned. A sequel he devised, &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, was less successful. Germaine Greer was publicly dismissive of it. Tynan wrote in a letter to Greer that while she was entitled to her opinion, &quot;Whether you are entitled to attend a party in celebration of the show you have just knocked, and to seek a heart-felt reconciliation with the person who devised it, I am not certain. But there is one thing to which I know you will never be entitled, and that is my friendship.&quot;

In 1971, Tynan and Roman Polanski co-wrote an unusually grim and violent screen adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In that same year, he returned to his childhood habit of keeping a journal, detailing his last few months at the National Theatre Company, which he finally left at the end of 1973 after being outmanoeuvred by its new artistic director, Peter Hall.

In the mid-1970s, Tynan made various failed efforts to explore serious sexual themes. He researched and wrote half a book on Wilhelm Reich. His attempts to compile an anthology of masturbation fantasies foundered after being rebuffed by Vladimir Nabokov, Graham Greene, Samuel Beckett and others, and he couldn&#x27;t raise enough money to finance a film about a sexual triangle. Sexual obsession and physical debility marked Tynan&#x27;s last years, according to Johnson.

Throughout the decade, Tynan wrote a series of influential profiles for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, on such subjects as Louise Brooks, Tom Stoppard, Mel Brooks, and Johnny Carson. In 1976, he moved with his family to California, in hopes of easing his emphysema. Tynan&#x27;s diaries, which he continued until the end of his life, are a mixture of self-examination and gossip, frequently hilarious and passionate, filled with wisdom and occasional folly. Ultimately, they reflect a growing sense of disappointment, including the observation, &quot;A critic is someone who knows the way, but can&#x27;t drive the car.&quot;

A defender of pornography, Tynan submitted three articles on sex to &quot;Playboy&quot;, but they were all rejected for publication. He was listed at number 3 in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s &quot;Top 30 chart of London&#x27;s most erotic writers&quot; in 2008.

==Personal life==
Tynan&#x27;s first marriage deteriorated to the point where he was living apart from Dundy, and they finally divorced in May 1964. In December 1962, he had met Kathleen Halton, the daughter of wartime CBC correspondent Matthew Halton and sister of contemporary CBC journalist David Halton. Tynan convinced her to leave her husband and live with him. On 30 June 1967, before a New Jersey Justice of the Peace, Tynan married a six-month pregnant Halton, with Marlene Dietrich as witness. During the ceremony, Dietrich backed towards some doors to close them; the judge interrupted his oration, and without change in tone or pace said: &quot;And do you, Kenneth, take Kathleen for your lawful-wedded—I wouldn&#x27;t stand with your ass to an open door in &quot;this&quot; office, lady—wife to have and to hold?&quot;

Tynan&#x27;s second marriage began falling apart, largely because of his &quot;insistence on total sexual latitude for himself, fidelity for his wife&quot;. He formed a relationship with a woman to enact sado-masochistic fantasies, sometimes involving both of them cross-dressing, sometimes hiring prostitutes as &quot;extras&quot; in elaborate scenes. Tynan told his wife that he intended to continue with the sessions weekly &quot;although all common sense and reason and kindness and even camaraderie are against it. ... It is my choice, my thing, my need ... It is fairly comic and slightly nasty. But it is shaking me like an infection and I cannot do anything but be shaken until the fit has passed.&quot;

The memoir of Tracy Tynan, his daughter from the marriage to Dundy, was published in 2016 in the United States. &quot;Wear and Tear: The Threads of My Life&quot; concerns her parents&#x27; tempestuous marriage, and Tynan&#x27;s later experiences of them after the couple divorced.

==Death and legacy==

On 26 July 1980, Tynan died in Santa Monica, California, of pulmonary emphysema, aged 53. He is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.

In 1994, the British Library acquired the Tynan Archive consisting of correspondence, manuscripts, National Theatre papers, and papers relating to &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;.

<text>George W. Little (March 22, 1942 – October 11, 2024) was an American Republican politician from the state of North Carolina and was a candidate for North Carolina Governor in the 2004 gubernatorial election.

==Life and career==
Born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, raised in Southern Pines, and an alumnus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Little was an insurance executive. He was involved with the Republican party since the 1970s, having served on the gubernatorial campaigns of Jim Holshouser and Jim Martin, as well as chair of the Moore County Republican Party. During Jim Holshouser&#x27;s tenure as governor, Little was appointed Secretary of Natural and Economic Resources.

Little served for years as chair of the Sandhills Community College Board of Trustees and campaigned for the successful 2000 North Carolina higher education bond measure. Little&#x27;s work on the board of his local community college has been praised for being completely nonpartisan. Sandhills is considered one of the top community colleges in the country.

Little entered the race for the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Democratic Governor Mike Easley in 2004. He had the support of both former governors Holshouser and Martin. The only one out of a field of six challengers who had not ever held elected office, Little&#x27;s largely self-financed campaign earned him four percent of the popular vote but left him in last place out of the crowded primary field.

In 2009, he was considered a possible candidate for chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party but endorsed Tom Fetzer instead.

Little died on October 11, 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A. () is a French multinational corporation, founded in 1665 in Paris as the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs, and today headquartered on the outskirts of Paris, at La Défense and in Courbevoie. Originally a mirror manufacturer, it also produces a variety of construction, high-performance, and other materials. Saint-Gobain is present in 76 countries and employs more than 170,000 people.

== History ==

=== 1665–1789: Manufacture royale ===
Since the mid-17th century, luxury products such as silk textiles, lace, and mirrors were in high demand. In the 1660s, mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society: Italian cabinets, châteaux, ornate side tables, and pier-tables were decorated with these expensive and luxurious products. At the time, however, the French were not known for mirror technology; instead, the Republic of Venice was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing, controlling a technical and commercial monopoly of the glass and mirror business. As a result, French Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert wanted France to become completely self-sufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products, thereby strengthening the national economy.

Colbert established, by letters patent, the public enterprise Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs (, &quot;Royal Mirror-Glass Factory&quot;) in October 1665. The company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the state. The beneficiary and first director was the French financier Nicolas du Noyer, a receiver of taxes of Orléans, who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirror-glass for twenty years. The company had the informal name &quot;Compagnie du Noyer&quot;.
To compete with the Italian mirror industry, Colbert commissioned several Venetian glassworkers he had enticed to Paris to work for the company. The first unblemished mirrors were produced in 1666. Soon the mirrors created in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, under the French company, began to rival those of Venice. The French company was capable of producing mirrors that were , which at the time, was considered impressive. Competition between France and the Venetians became so fierce that Venice considered it a crime for any glass artisan to leave and practice their trade elsewhere, especially in foreign territory. Nicolas du Noyer complained in writing that the Venetians were unwilling to impart the secrets of glassmaking to the French workers and that the company was hard-pressed to pay its expenses. Life in Paris proved distracting to the workers, and supplies of firewood to stoke the furnaces were dearer in the capital than elsewhere. In 1667, the glass-making was transferred to a small glass furnace already working at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg in Normandy, and the premises in Faubourg Saint-Antoine were devoted to glass-grinding and polishing the crude product.

Though the &quot;Compagnie du Noyer&quot; was reduced at times to importing Venetian glass and finishing it in France, by September 1672 the royal French manufacturer was on a sufficiently sound footing for the importation of glass to be forbidden to any of Louis&#x27; subjects, under any conditions. In 1678, the company produced the glass for the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.

In 1683, the company&#x27;s financial arrangement with the State was renewed for another two decades. However, in 1688 the rival &quot;Compagnie Thévart&quot; was created, also financed in part by the state. &quot;Compagnie Thévart&quot; used a new pouring process that allowed it to make plate glass mirrors measuring at least , much bigger than the that the &quot;Compagnie du Noyer&quot; could create.

The two companies competed for seven years, until 1695 when the economy slowed down and their technical and commercial rivalry became counterproductive. Under an order from the French government, the two companies were forced to merge, creating the &quot;Compagnie Plastier&quot;. A mirror factory in the village of Saint-Gobain in Picardie gave its name to the present company.

In 1702, &quot;Compagnie Plastier&quot; declared bankruptcy. A group of Franco-Swiss Protestant bankers rescued the collapsing company, changing the name to &quot;Compagnie Dagincourt&quot;. At the same time, the company was provided royal patents which allowed it to maintain a legal monopoly in the glass-manufacturing industry up until the French Revolution (1789), despite fierce, sometimes violent, protests from free enterprise partisans.

=== 1789–1910: Industrial Revolution ===
In 1789, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the state financial and competitive privileges accorded to &quot;Compagnie Dagincourt&quot; were abolished. The company had to depend on the participation and capital of private investors, although it continued to remain partly under the control of the French state.

In the 1820s, Saint-Gobain continued to function as it had under the Ancien Régime, manufacturing high-quality mirrors and glass for the luxury market. However, although in 1824, a new glass manufacturer was established in Commentry, France, and in 1837, several Belgian glass manufacturers were also founded. While Saint-Gobain continued to dominate the luxury high-quality mirror and glass markets, its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and low-quality products. The manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors and glass affordable for the masses. In response, the company extended its product line to include lower-quality glass and mirrors.

In 1830, just as Louis-Philippe became King of the newly restored French Monarchy, Saint-Gobain was transformed into a Public Limited Company and became independent from the state for the first time.

While mirrors remained their primary business, Saint-Gobain began to diversify their product line to include glass panes for skylights, roofs, and room dividers, thick mirrors, semi-thick glass for windows, laminated mirrors and glass, and finally embossed mirrors and windowpanes. Some of the more famous buildings that Saint-Gobain contributed to during that period were the Crystal Palace in London, Jardin des Plantes, the Grand Palais and adjacent Petit Palais in Paris, and the Milan Central railway station.

Saint-Gobain merged with another French glass and mirror manufacturer, Saint-Quirin, in the mid-19th century. After the merger, the company was able to gain control of 25% of European glass and mirror production (before, it had only controlled 10–15%). In response to growing international competition, the company began to establish up new manufacturing facilities in countries without any domestic manufacturers.

Saint-Gobain cast the glass blanks of some of the largest optical reflecting telescopes of the early 20th century, including the ground-breaking Hale telescope (online in 1908), the 61-inch (1.54 m) Bosque Alegre telescope built in 1912, for the Argentine National Observatory, directed by Charles D. Perrine, and 100 inch (2.5 m) Hooker telescope (online 1917) at Mount Wilson Observatory (United States), and the Plaskett telescope (online in 1918) at Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (Canada).

By the end of the 19th century, Saint-Gobain named the Casa Pellandini “its sole representative and exclusive depositary throughout the Mexican Republic.&quot;

=== 1910–1950: Post Industrial Revolution ===
Saint-Gobain experienced significant success in the early 20th century. In 1918, the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles, jars, tableware, and domestic glassware.

In 1920, Saint-Gobain extended its businesses to fibreglass manufacturing. Fibreglass was being used to create insulation, industrial textiles, and building reinforcements. In 1937, the company founded &quot;Isover&quot;, a subsidiary fibreglass insulation manufacturer.

During this period, the company developed three new glassmaking techniques and processes; first, a dipping technique used to coat car windows, which prevented the glass from shattering in the event of an accident. As a result of that technique, 10% of Saint-Gobain&#x27;s 1920 sales came from the car industry, and 28% in 1930. Second, a few years later, another technique was developed that allowed glass to be shaped and bent. Finally, a process was developed to coat glass with aluminum, allowing it to be used as a conductor, and allowed the company to create products such as the ‘radiavers’ (French for “radiating glass”), a unique type of electric heater with the heating element encased in glass.

===1950–1970: Pont-à-Mousson merger===
Between 1950 and 1969, Saint-Gobain&#x27;s sales rose at a rate of 10% per year. Its workforce grew from 35,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1969. By the end of the 1960s, Saint-Gobain had more than 150 subsidiaries under its control.

Glass and fibreglass sales benefited from the booming construction industry and the rise in mass consumption after the Second World War. Saint-Gobain&#x27;s yearly glass production went from in 1950 to in 1969. In 1950, fibreglass only represented 4% of the company&#x27;s turnover, but by 1969, this had grown to 20%.

Domestic sales in France accounted for only a fifth of the company&#x27;s revenue. Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium were also important markets.

In 1968, Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel, a French industrial group, made a hostile takeover bid for Saint-Gobain. The company looked for a &quot;white knight&quot; to help fend off the bid. Multinational corporation Suez suggested that Saint-Gobain and Pont-à-Mousson (another French industrial group) should merge, to maintain independence from Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel. After the merger, &quot;Saint-Gobain-Pont-à-Mousson&quot;, later known simply by the name &quot;Saint-Gobain&quot;, produced pipes in addition to glass and fibreglass.

===1971–1986: Nationalisation===
The next fifteen years were a time of change and reorganization for the newly merged companies. In the 1970s, Western economies were suffering a sharp downturn. Saint-Gobain&#x27;s financial performance was adversely affected by the economic and petrol crises.

In 1981 and 1982, ten of France&#x27;s top-performing companies were nationalized by the socialist party-controlled Fifth Republic of France. By February 1982, Saint-Gobain was officially controlled by the state. However, the company did not last long as a government-owned corporation; it was re-privatized in 1987.

===1986–present: Expansion===
When Saint-Gobain once again became a private enterprise, control of the company quickly changed hands. Jean-Louis Beffa, an engineer and graduate of the École Polytechnique, became the CEO. Beffa invested heavily in research and development and pushed strongly for the company to produce engineered materials, such as abrasives and ceramics.

Under Beffa, the company continued to expand internationally, setting up foreign factories, and acquiring many of its foreign competitors. In 1996 the company bought Poliet (the French building and construction distribution group) and its subsidiaries, such as Point P. and Lapeyre. This expanded Saint-Gobain&#x27;s product line into construction materials and their distribution. In 2005, Olivier Bluche took the helm of Supply Chain Operations, quickly modernising the company&#x27;s lengthy and dated processes. In October 2022, Saint-Gobain Films &amp; Fabrics was renamed Saint-Gobain Composite Solutions. In 2023, the company&#x27;s India-arm acquired Twiga Fiberglass, a manufacturer of glass wool with production facilities located near Delhi and Mumbai.

==Company structure==
=== Head office ===
The company has its head office in Les Miroirs in La Défense and in Courbevoie. The building served as the company head office since 1981.

In 2006, Saint Gobain announced a JV, Avancis, with Shell to produce PV modules based on CIS film technology. After the company had entirely owned Avancis and its two plants in Germany manufacturing thin CIS film modules for some time, it was sold to China National Building Materials Group Corporation (CNBM) in 2014.

====External venturing====
Saint-Gobain also has a division that focuses on connecting entrepreneurs, startups, and innovators to the 50+ bin Saint-Gobain called: NOVA External Venturing. The External Venturing unit has staff in Boston, Paris, and Shanghai interested in connecting with entrepreneurs working in advanced materials, construction products, and environmental sustainability.

==Acquisitions and sales==
In December 2005, Saint-Gobain purchased the British company BPB plc, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of plasterboard, for US$6.7 billion. In August 2007, the company acquired Maxit Group, doubling the size of its Industrial Mortars business and adding the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates to its business portfolio. In 2012, the company acquired SAGE Electrochromics, an innovative manufacturer of glass that tints on command. In the same year its BPB subsidiary purchased Celotex. In 2018 Saint Gobain acquired UK-based Farécla Products, one of the largest polishing compound manufacturers in the world. In 2024, Saint-Gobain agreed to acquire Australian building materials maker CSR Limited for billion (billion).

The company has also sold off various assets. Recently the company sold its cosmetic glass manufacturing business, including a plant in Newton County, Georgia, United States. In 2021, the company acquired GCP Applied Technologies. GCP and Saint-Gobain&#x27;s CHRYSO were joined into the new Construction Chemicals division.

===Saint-Gobain Gyproc Middle-East===
Saint-Gobain Gyproc Middle East began trading as Gyproc in 2005. In April 2010, the company&#x27;s first plasterboard manufacturing plant opened on a seven-hectare site in Abu Dhabi.

Gyproc products have been used on some of the largest projects in the region, including the stations and main depot for Dubai Metro; Atlantis Hotel – Palm Jumeirah, Capital Gate – Abu Dhabi, Ferrari Experience – Abu Dhabi and Masdar Institute – Abu Dhabi.

===Saint-Gobain in India===
Saint-Gobain India Private Limited – Glass Business (formerly Saint-Gobain Glass India Limited) is a subsidiary of Saint Gobain that manufactures and markets solar control glass, fire-resistant glass and other various types of float glasses in India. It has its manufacturing plant at Sriperumbudur, from Chennai.

Saint-Gobain started its venture in India in 1996 by acquiring a majority stake of Grindwell Norton. Later in 2000, it started its own glass manufacturing unit at Sriperumbudur. In June 2011, Saint Gobain Glass India acquired Sezal Glass float-line business, based in the state of Gujarat, India. The acquisition adds about 550 tons per day additional capacity, and the deal was inked at around US$150 million. In addition, Saint-Gobain Glass invested in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan in 2014, which adds another 950 tons of glass per day. And recently in 2018, Saint-Gobain again invested in Sriperumbudur with 950-ton capacity, which results in the production of 3850 tons of glass per day from India.

== Brands ==
Saint-Gobain comprises several brands, including Saint-Gobain Glass, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, RIW, GCP Applied Technologies, Weber, British Gypsum, Decoustics, Glassolutions, Gyproc, Artex, Isover, Ecophon, Pasquill and PAM.

== Environmental record ==
Saint-Gobain had contaminated ground water supply with PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid – a highly persistent contaminant) in multiple towns in southern New Hampshire, USA. Elevated levels of perfluorooctanoic acid were found in 2016, near the Saint-Gobain plant in Merrimack. Pollution has been occurring for over 20 years. Saint-Gobain deliberately and intentionally constructed a bypass stack to thwart environmental inspections and avoid PFAS removal. Despite this flagrant violation of their permit they were allowed to continue to operate. Former state representative and environmental scientist Mindi Messmer has claimed links between exposure to Saint-Gobain’s PFAS emissions and kidney and renal pelvis cancer, testicular cancer, female breast cancer, prostate cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, cardiovascular impacts.
As of 2022, Saint Gobain is involved in multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuits. Its former company lawyer was terminated after he repeatedly urged &quot;the company to do more to address contamination from their plants in Merrimack; Bennington, Vermont; and Hoosick Falls, N.Y&quot;.

<text>Praying with Anger is a 1992 independent drama film written, produced, directed by, and starring M. Night Shyamalan in his directorial debut.

It is about a young Indian American&#x27;s return to India and explores the clash of Western values with those of the Indian subcontinent.

==Plot==
Indian American Dev Raman returns to his native country to spend a year as part of a college exchange program. He is initially reluctant, but his mother insists, and he respects her wishes. While there, he discovers that his cold and distant father, now deceased, carried a quiet and profound affection towards him.

While he is in India, he receives guidance from his friend Sanjay. As the visit progresses, Dev ignores Sanjay&#x27;s suggestions, and the interaction between Indian and Western cultures quickly precipitates into misunderstanding and violence.

Dev realizes that one may pray to the deities of the Hindu pantheon in almost any emotional state except indifference. As he explores his past and sees the miscommunication between the two cultures, Dev is overwhelmed and finds himself only able to pray with anger.

==Cast==
* M. Night Shyamalan as Dev Raman
* Mike Muthu as Sanjay
* Richa Ahuja as Rupal Mohan
* Sushma Ahuja as Mrs. Mohan
* Arun Balachandran as Raj Kahn
* Christabal Howie as Sabitha

==Release==
The film never received a wide release for mainstream distribution and has been shown primarily at film festivals. &quot;Praying with Anger&quot; screened at the 1993 AFI Fest, where it won the &quot;First Film Competition&quot; for American independent filmmakers.

<text>Judy Nylon (born Judith Anne Niland in 1948) is a multidisciplinary American artist who moved to London in 1970. She was half of the punk rock music group Snatch, which also featured fellow American expat Patti Palladin. She had an influence on glam, punk and no wave music in New York City and London, although the bulk of this has not been preserved in any record. &quot;NME&quot;″s Paul Tickell described her LP &quot;Pal Judy&quot; (1982), coproduced by Nylon and Adrian Sherwood, as &quot;a classic rainy day bit of sound and song to drift away to.&quot;

Nylon is the subject of Brian Eno&#x27;s song &quot;Back in Judy&#x27;s Jungle&quot; and appeared in the video for the song &quot;China My China&quot;, from his 1974 LP &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot;. Eno also credits Nylon as an influence in the genesis of ambient music on the back cover of his 1975 LP &quot;Discreet Music&quot;. In 1978, Eno and Snatch made &quot;R.A.F.&quot; (b/w &quot;Kings Lead Hat&quot;), which involves sound elements from a Baader Meinhof ransom message as part of Nylon&#x27;s sound montage/cut-up practice.

During the &#x27;70s she often collaborated with Welsh musician/producer John Cale. In 1974 she added spoken sections to the song &quot;The Man Who Couldn&#x27;t Afford to Orgy&quot; on his album &quot;Fear&quot;. She subsequently performed with him at concerts and on other recordings, including his 1987 live album &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. Along with Patti Palladin, she also sang backing vocals with Johnny Thunders&#x27; All Stars on his early 1978 shows.

Since 2007 Nylon has periodically contributed to the collective Aether9, who collaborate on public art performances. Her multi-disciplinary work focuses on international co-authorship and decentralized many-to-many style video storytelling. In 2010, Nylon contributed guest vocals to the &quot;Babylon By Car&quot; album by the French electronica group Bot&#x27;Ox.

<doc id="872367" wikidata="Q449573" url="?curid=872367" title="Paddle (game controller)">
<text>A paddle is a game controller with a round &quot;wheel&quot; and one or more &quot;fire buttons&quot;, where the wheel is typically used to control movement of the player object along one axis of the video screen. A paddle controller rotates through a fixed arc (usually about 330 degrees); it has a stop at each end.

The name &quot;paddle&quot; is derived from the first game that used it, &quot;Pong&quot;, being a video game simulation of table tennis, whose racquets are commonly called paddles. Even though the simulated paddles appeared on-screen (as small line segments), it was the hand controllers used to move the line segments that actually came to bear the name.

Some famous video games using paddles are &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;Breakout&quot;, and &quot;Night Driver&quot;.

== Design ==

The paddle wheel is usually mechanically coupled to a potentiometer, so as to generate an output voltage level varying with the wheel&#x27;s angle relative to a fixed reference position. A paddle is thus an absolute position controller. That is, without any previous knowledge, the sensor can be read and the result directly indicates the position of the paddle knob. This is in contrast to a rotary encoder-based device or &quot;spinner&quot;.

== Applications ==
Paddles first appeared in video arcade games with Atari Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; in 1972, while the first console to use paddles was Magnavox&#x27;s Odyssey that same year. The Apple II shipped with paddles until 1980. The Atari 2600 used paddles for several of its games, as did early home computers such as the VIC-20. True (potentiometer-based) paddles are almost never employed any more because they stop reading accurately when the potentiometer contacts get dirty or worn, because turning them too far can break them and because they require more-expensive analog sensing, whereas quadrature encoder-based controllers can be sensed digitally. Any recent game that has paddle-type control uses a quadrature encoder instead, even if the game uses paddles on screen (like Arkanoid).

== Similar controllers ==
On the Atari 2600, the paddle controllers look very similar to the driving controllers. The driving controllers emulated the steering wheel controls found in contemporary games, where one spun the wheel to cause the car to turn one direction or the other, and stopped the spinning to drive straight. The driving controllers for Atari consoles operated in the same way, although they did not have a wheel, the controller was reduced to a single large knob identical to the one on the paddles.

In comparison to the driving controllers, paddle controllers rotate just under one full rotation before hitting a hard stop. They also come in pairs that plug into a single port, whereas the driving controllers were one to a port. Finally, they have a picture of a tennis racquet and the word &quot;paddle&quot; on it, as opposed to a racing car and the word &quot;driving&quot;. Because two controllers connect to each port and the 2600 has two controller ports, four players simultaneously can play in games that support it. The Atari paddles are also compatible with the Atari 8-bit computers, which initially had four controller ports allowing eight paddles. Super Breakout is one example that supported up to 8 players.

Atari also offered driving controllers for use with games like &quot;Indy 500&quot;, which requires wheels that can spin around continuously in one direction. Driving controllers have a picture of a car and the word &quot;driving&quot; on it and a single controller attaches to each controller port. The driving controller is not compatible with paddle games. Like a mechanical computer mouse, the driving controller is a quadrature encoder-based device and thus only sensed relative position, not absolute position. This controller is functionally identical to the spin-dial controller used in Atari&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; arcade game. Since only one controller attaches to each port, only two people can play driving games simultaneously.

Several similar relative spinner controllers have emerged as part of the home-built arcade cabinet scene to facilitate play of such games as &quot;Tempest&quot;, including spinners from Oscar Controls and the SlikStik Tornado spinner. These devices are typically made to plug directly into a computer as a single-axis mouse.

<text>Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, 1st Baronet (1 November 1798 – 19 May 1868) was an Irish brewer and philanthropist.

==Brewer==
Born in Dublin, he was the third son of the second Arthur Guinness, and his wife Anne Lee, and a grandson of the first Arthur, who had bought the St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery in 1759. He joined his father in the business in his late teens, without attending university, and from 1839 he took sole control within the family. From 1855, when his father died, Guinness had become the richest man in Ireland, having built up a huge export trade and by continually enlarging his brewery.

In numbers, sales of his single and double stouts had been 78,000 hogsheads in 1855, which he nearly trebled to 206,000 hogsheads in 1865. Of these, some 112,000 were sold in Ireland, as the rural economy recovered from the Great Famine of the 1840s, and 94,000 were exported to Britain.

By 1870, soon after his death, sales had risen further to 256,000 hogsheads, of which 120,000 were exported to Britain. Benjamin had also created the capacity for his sons to expand sales much further, and by 1879 these reached 565,000 hogsheads.

As a part of the brewery expansion, and to ensure deliveries, he invested in the new Irish railway companies from the 1840s. By 1867 the firm owned £86,000-worth of Irish railway stock (worth over £135m in 2013 values, taken as a share of GDP).

==Dublin politician==
In 1851 he was elected the first Lord Mayor of Dublin under the reformed corporation.

In 1863 he was made an honorary LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) by Trinity College Dublin, and on 15 April 1867 was created a baronet by patent, in addition to which, on 18 May 1867, by royal licence, he had a grant of supporters to his family arms.

Guinness was elected to the House of Commons in 1865 as a Conservative representative for Dublin City, serving until his death. His party&#x27;s leader was Lord Derby. Previously he had supported the Liberal Lord Palmerston, but in the 1860s the Liberals proposed higher taxation on drinks such as beer. Before 1865 the Irish Conservative Party did not entirely support British conservative policy, but did so after the Irish Church Act 1869. The government&#x27;s most notable reform was the Reform Act 1867 that expanded the franchise.

==Philanthropist==

From 1860 to 1865, he undertook at his own expense, and without hiring an architect, the restoration of the city&#x27;s St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, an enterprise that cost him over £150,000. In 1865 the building was restored to the dean and chapter, and reopened for services on 24 February.
The citizens of Dublin and the dean and chapter of St. Patrick&#x27;s presented him with addresses on 31 December 1865, expressive of their gratitude for what he had done for the city. The addresses were in two volumes, which were afterwards exhibited at the Paris Exhibition.

In recognition of his generosity, he was made a baronet in 1867. He was one of the ecclesiastical commissioners for Ireland, a governor of Simpson&#x27;s Hospital, and vice-chairman of the Dublin Exhibition Palace. He died the following year at his Park Lane London home. At the time of his death he was engaged in the restoration of Archbishop Marsh&#x27;s public library, a building which adjoins St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, which was finished by his son Arthur.

He showed his practical interest in Irish archæology by carefully preserving the antiquarian remains existing on his large estates around Ashford Castle in County Galway, which he bought in 1855. Nearby Cong Abbey was well-known, and the famous Cross of Cong had been moved to a Dublin museum in 1839.

==Family==
On 24 February 1837 he married his first cousin Elizabeth Guinness, third daughter of Edward Guinness of Dublin, and they had three sons and a daughter, living at Beaumont House, Beaumont, in north County Dublin. In 1856 he bought what is now Iveagh House at 80 St Stephen&#x27;s Green. Ashford Castle was described in William Wilde&#x27;s book on Lough Corrib in the 1860s.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Arthur, who took over the brewery with his brother, the third son, Edward. His second son Benjamin married Henrietta, daughter of Thomas St Lawrence, 3rd Earl of Howth; they moved to England where he was a captain in the Royal Horse Guards. His daughter Anne married William, Lord Plunket in 1863. The present-day Guinness Baronets descend from his second son Benjamin with their son Algernon Arthur St. Lawrence Lee Guinness (1883–1954) becoming Sir Algernon, 3rd Baronet on the death of his childless uncle, Lord Ardilaun in 1915.

He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin, in the family vault, on 27 May. His personalty was sworn under £1,100,000 on 8 August 1868. A bronze statue of him by John Foley was erected by the Cathedral Chapter in St. Patrick&#x27;s churchyard, on the south side of the cathedral, in September 1875, which was restored in 2006.

<doc id="872373" wikidata="Q5604954" url="?curid=872373" title="Greenwood, Seattle">
<text>Greenwood is a neighborhood in north central Seattle, Washington, United States. The intersection of Greenwood Avenue North and North 85th Street is the commercial center. Greenwood is known for its numerous bars, restaurants, coffee houses, theatres and specialty stores. Greenwood&#x27;s main thoroughfares are Greenwood Avenue North and N. 85th streets.

Since 1993 the neighborhood has hosted the &quot;Greenwood Car Show&quot; on the last Saturday in June. Another annual event is the &quot;Greenwood Seafair Parade&quot;, held on the fourth Wednesday in July. Both events draw tens of thousands of visitors to the neighborhood.

==Boundaries==
The generally accepted boundaries are Aurora Avenue N (State Route 99) to the east, beyond which lies Licton Springs; N 105th Street/Holman Road to the north, beyond which lie Broadview and Bitter Lake; 8th Avenue NW to the west, beyond which lies Crown Hill, and N 75th Street to the south, beyond which lies Phinney Ridge. The division between Greenwood and Phinney Ridge is nebulous; the two neighborhoods plan events jointly.

==Schools and public services==
Greenwood is served by the North Cluster of the Seattle Public Schools. No high school is located within the North Cluster but Nathan Hale, Roosevelt, Ballard, and Ingraham are all nearby. Schools in Greenwood include Greenwood Elementary and St. John Catholic School.

The neighborhood has had its own branch of the Seattle Public Library since 1928. The current Greenwood branch building was completed in 2005 and renovated in spring 2017. Recreation areas maintained by the City of Seattle include Alice Ball Park, Sandel Park and Greenwood Park. Greenwood has its own post office, which shares zip code 98103 with the larger Wallingford branch.

==Geological issues==
The heart of Greenwood lies atop a peat deposit, also known as a bog. The area was molded into a bowl shape after the last glacial retreat, that was in turn, filled with runoff of dead plants that created the peat bog.

When groundwater is removed, the peat compresses, causing building settlement that cannot be undone. Commercial development has created an impervious surface and diverted rainwater to city sewers. On August 22, 2008, the city added peat bogs to the list of Environmentally Critical Areas. This is intended to encourage building techniques that would stabilize the ground water and reduce building settlement in the neighborhood.

Greenwood has areas where streets and sidewalks have also been damaged due to irregular settlement. In 2012 the city of Seattle rebuilt North 85th Street and repaved much of Greenwood Avenue North. Many sidewalks along these streets were also repaired, though evidence of prior damage can still be seen.

==History==
Originally named Woodland, the neighborhood became Greenwood in 1907. Greenwood Avenue carried city streetcar and Seattle-Everett interurban passenger railroad traffic during the first half of the twentieth century.

The section of the neighborhood north of 85th Street was annexed to the city of Seattle in 1954. Residents of the area who voted for annexation expected that the city would build sidewalks. However, many residential streets north of 85th Street are still without sidewalks.

===2009 arson investigation===
In 2009, the heart of Greenwood experienced several dramatic arson fires. On August 13, a house fire seriously injured a man and caused $170,000 damage. The largest fire, on October 23, burned a building to the ground on N 85th Street in the neighborhood center. Four businesses were destroyed: the Green Bean Coffee house; Phở Tic Tac; Szechuan Bistro; and C.C. Teriyaki. This fire also caused significant damage to a neighboring historic building housing the Taproot Theatre Company. A $10,000 reward was offered.

Two fires occurred on November 5 and three more on November 9. The most severe of these caused $20,000 worth of damage and forced the closure of the Olive You restaurant. On November 13, Seattle police arrested a 46-year-old homeless man who frequented the neighborhood. The suspect had been spotted at the scene of three previous fires. He initially pleaded innocent to 12 charges, but changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
===2016 explosion===
Early on the morning of Wednesday, March 9, 2016, a natural gas leak caused a massive explosion, destroying three small buildings on Greenwood Avenue just south of North 85th Street and injuring several firefighters. The businesses lost were Neptune Coffee (8415), Mr. Gyros (restaurant) (8411), and a Quick Stop convenience store (8409). The damage was estimated at $3 million; many other buildings in the area also had broken windows and other damage.

<doc id="872374" wikidata="Q7136015" url="?curid=872374" title="Parastatistics">
<text>In quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, parastatistics is a hypothetical alternative to the established particle statistics models (Bose–Einstein statistics, Fermi–Dirac statistics and Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics). Other alternatives include anyonic statistics and braid statistics, both of these involving lower spacetime dimensions. Herbert S. Green is credited with the creation of parastatistics in 1953. The particles predicted by parastatistics have not been experimentally observed.

==Formalism==
Consider the operator algebra of a system of &quot;N&quot; identical particles. This is a *-algebra. There is an &quot;SN&quot; group (symmetric group of order &quot;N&quot;) acting upon the operator algebra with the intended interpretation of permuting the &quot;N&quot; particles. Quantum mechanics requires focus on observables having a physical meaning, and the observables would have to be invariant under all possible permutations of the &quot;N&quot; particles. For example, in the case &quot;N&quot; = 2, &quot;R&quot;2 − &quot;R&quot;1 cannot be an observable because it changes sign if we switch the two particles, but the distance |&quot;R&quot;2 − &quot;R&quot;1| between the two particles is a legitimate observable.

In other words, the observable algebra would have to be a *-subalgebra invariant under the action of &quot;SN&quot; (noting that this does not mean that every element of the operator algebra invariant under &quot;SN&quot; is an observable). This allows different superselection sectors, each parameterized by a Young diagram of &quot;SN&quot;.

In particular:
* For &quot;N&quot; identical parabosons of order &quot;p&quot; (where &quot;p&quot; is a positive integer), permissible Young diagrams are all those with &quot;p&quot; or fewer rows.
* For &quot;N&quot; identical parafermions of order &quot;p&quot;, permissible Young diagrams are all those with &quot;p&quot; or fewer columns.
* If &quot;p&quot; is 1, this reduces to Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac statistics respectively.
* If &quot;p&quot; is arbitrarily large (infinite), this reduces to Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics.

== Trilinear relations ==
There are creation and annihilation operators satisfying the trilinear commutation relations
: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3

==Quantum field theory==
A paraboson field of order &quot;p&quot;, formula_4, where if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are spacelike-separated points, formula_5 and formula_6 if formula_7, where [⋅, ⋅] is the commutator, and {⋅, ⋅} is the anticommutator. Note that this disagrees with the spin–statistics theorem, which is for bosons and not parabosons. There might be a group such as the symmetric group &quot;Sp&quot; acting upon the &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)s. Observables would have to be operators which are invariant under the group in question. However, the existence of such a symmetry is not essential.

A parafermion field formula_8 of order &quot;p&quot;, where if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are spacelike-separated points, formula_9 and formula_10 if formula_7. The same comment about observables would apply together with the requirement that they have even grading under the grading where the &quot;ψ&quot;s have odd grading.

The &quot;parafermionic and parabosonic algebras&quot; are generated by elements that obey the commutation and anticommutation relations. They generalize the usual &quot;fermionic algebra&quot; and the &quot;bosonic algebra&quot; of quantum mechanics. The Dirac algebra and the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau algebra appear as special cases of the parafermionic algebra for order &quot;p&quot; = 1 and &quot;p&quot; = 2 respectively.

=== Explanation ===
Note that if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are spacelike-separated points, &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) neither commute nor anticommute unless &quot;p&quot; = 1. The same comment applies to &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). So, if we have &quot;n&quot; spacelike-separated points &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;,

: formula_12

corresponds to creating &quot;n&quot; identical parabosons at &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Similarly,

: formula_13

corresponds to creating &quot;n&quot; identical parafermions. Because these fields neither commute nor anticommute,

: formula_14

and

: formula_15

give distinct states for each permutation π in &quot;Sn&quot;.

We can define a permutation operator formula_16 by

: formula_17

and

: formula_18

respectively. This can be shown to be well-defined as long as formula_16 is only restricted to states spanned by the vectors given above (essentially the states with &quot;n&quot; identical particles). It is also unitary. Moreover, formula_20 is an operator-valued representation of the symmetric group &quot;Sn&quot;, and as such, we can interpret it as the action of &quot;Sn&quot; upon the &quot;n&quot;-particle Hilbert space itself, turning it into a unitary representation.

<text>Harold Craig Reynolds (born November 26, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player and current television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from to , most prominently as a member of the Seattle Mariners, where he was a two-time All-Star player and a three-time Gold Glove Award winner. He also played for the Baltimore Orioles and the California Angels. In 1991, Reynolds was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award. After his playing career, he became a four-time Emmy Award winning television baseball analyst, working for the MLB Network and Fox Sports.

==Early career==

===High school===
Born in Eugene, Oregon, Reynolds was raised in Corvallis and starred in football, basketball, and baseball at Corvallis High School. He was a member of the state championship (AAA) football team in 1978, graduated in 1979, and was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He was a member of Corvallis&#x27; American Legion baseball team that won state and regional titles in August 1978.

===College===
Reynolds was selected in the sixth round (144th overall) of the 1979 MLB draft by the San Diego Padres on June 5. He opted not to sign and attended college initially at San Diego State University before transferring to Cañada College in Redwood City, California. In the 1980 MLB draft on June 3, Reynolds was selected with the second pick of the amateur draft&#x27;s secondary phase by the Seattle Mariners.

On June 1, 2013, Reynolds was inducted into the Cañada College Hall of Fame and was presented with the &quot;Colts Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;.

==Professional career==
Reynolds spent several seasons in the minor leagues, playing for the Wausau Timbers (A) in Wisconsin in 1981, Lynn Sailors (AA) in Massachusetts in 1982, and Salt Lake Gulls (AAA) in Utah in 1983, prior to his major league debut on September 2, 1983. In his major league debut, Reynolds appeared as a pinch runner for Ken Phelps in the ninth inning of a 5–4 loss to the New York Yankees. During his time in the minors, Reynolds learned how to switch hit by working with minor league manager and former Cincinnati Reds catcher Bill Plummer. The following season, he played AAA ball in Salt Lake before being called up again in September 1984. Reynolds exceeded his rookie limits during the 1985 season and batted .144 with 3 RBI in 67 games. The next season, Reynolds appeared in over 100 games for the first time. He finished the season batting .222 with a home run, 24 RBI and 30 stolen bases in 126 games.

Reynolds was an All-Star in and , led the American League in stolen bases with 60 in 1987, in triples with 11 in 1988, and in at-bats with 642 in 1990. He was the only player other than Rickey Henderson to lead the American League in stolen bases during any season in the 1980s. However, Reynolds was also caught stealing 20 times in 1987, which led the AL, and he was caught 29 times in 1988, which led the majors. On defense, Reynolds won three Gold Glove Awards and led the American League in assists and double plays five times each. In 1986, he played in Puerto Rico with the Mayagüez Indians.

On September 30, 1990, Reynolds was the last man to bat at Comiskey Park. He grounded out against Chicago White Sox pitcher Bobby Thigpen to close out a 2–1 White Sox win.

In 1991, Reynolds won the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to a Major League Baseball player selected for his character and charitable contributions to his community.

On October 26, 1992, Reynolds was granted free agency. He signed a one-year, $1.65 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles on December 11, 1992. He played in 145 games with the Orioles, batting .252 with four home runs and 47 RBI. After one season with the Orioles, he again entered free agency on October 29, 1993. Reynolds signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on January 28, 1994, before being traded to the California Angels on March 29 for Hilly Hathaway. The 1994 season was Reynolds&#x27; final season in the major leagues.

Reynolds led the league in double plays turned by a second baseman five times and in errors committed by a second baseman four times, and won three Gold Glove awards for his play at second base.

==Broadcasting==
Reynolds joined ESPN in 1996 as a lead studio analyst on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;. He appeared at major baseball events on the ESPN set, including the All-Star Game and the World Series. He also was a commentator for ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the College World Series and Little League World Series. However, he was fired from the network in July 2006 following accusations of sexual harassment. Reynolds called the incident &quot;a total misunderstanding,&quot; claiming that a hug he had given a woman had been misinterpreted. Reynolds filed a $5 million lawsuit against ESPN for payment of the remainder of his contract. ESPN settled the case with Reynolds in April 2008, and paid him a seven-figure sum.

Reynolds joined MLB.com as a commentator in June 2007. In April 2008, he joined Mets pre-game and post-game coverage on SportsNet New York as a baseball commentator. Reynolds also worked with TBS on their Sunday baseball telecasts, as well as the 2008 MLB playoffs.

Reynolds has been an analyst on MLB Network since its launch in January 2009. Reynolds regularly appears on &quot;MLB Tonight&quot;, &quot;Quick Pitch&quot;, &quot;Diamond Demo&quot; and MLB Network&#x27;s breaking news and special event coverage, including the All-Star Game, Postseason and World Series. He was nominated for a Sports Emmy Award for his work as a studio analyst on MLB Network in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Reynolds became a member of the &quot;MLB on Fox&quot; pregame show in 2012, which at the time was being produced out of MLB Network&#x27;s studios. Reynolds worked on Fox&#x27;s pregame show for two years alongside Matt Vasgersian and Kevin Millar. After the 2013 season, Reynolds, along with Tom Verducci, was promoted to join Joe Buck on the network&#x27;s top broadcast team following the retirement of lead analyst Tim McCarver, which lasted for two seasons until the duo was replaced by John Smoltz in 2016.

==Personal life==
Reynolds is a Christian and is the youngest of eight children. His brother Don Reynolds is a former outfielder who played parts of two seasons with the San Diego Padres.

<text>Papillon (, &quot;butterfly&quot;) is a novel written by Henri Charrière, first published in France on 30 April 1969. &quot;Papillon&quot; is Charrière&#x27;s nickname. The novel details Papillon&#x27;s purported incarceration and subsequent escape from the French penal colony of French Guiana, and covers a 14-year period between 1931 and 1945. While Charrière claimed that Papillon was largely true, modern researchers believe that much of the book’s material came from other inmates, rather than Charrière himself. 

==Synopsis==
The book is an account of a 14-year period in Papillon&#x27;s life (October 26, 1931, to October 18, 1945), beginning when he was wrongly convicted of murder in France and sentenced to a life of hard labor at the &quot;Bagne de Cayenne&quot;, the penal colony of Cayenne in French Guiana known as Devil&#x27;s Island. He eventually escaped from the colony and settled in Venezuela, where he lived and prospered.

After a brief stay at a prison in Caen, Papillon was put aboard a vessel bound for South America, where he learned about the brutal life that prisoners endured at the prison colony. Violence and murders were common among the convicts. Men were attacked for many reasons, including money, which most kept in a &quot;charger&quot; (a hollow metal cylinder concealed in the rectum; also known as a &quot;plan d&#x27;evasion&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, or &quot;escape suppository&quot;). Papillon befriended Louis Dega, a former banker convicted of counterfeiting. He agreed to protect Dega from attackers trying to get his &quot;charger.&quot;

Upon arriving at the penal colony, Papillon claimed to be ill and was sent to the infirmary. There he collaborated with two men, Clousiot and André Maturette, to escape from the prison. They planned to use a sailboat acquired with the help of the associated leper colony at an island near Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. The Maroni River carried them to the Atlantic Ocean, and they sailed to the northwest, reaching Trinidad.

In Trinidad the trio were joined by three other escapees; they were aided by a British family, the Dutch bishop of Curaçao, and several others. Nearing the Colombian coastline, the escapees were sighted. The wind died and they were captured and imprisoned again.

In Colombian prison, Papillon joined with another prisoner to escape. Some distance from the prison, the two went their separate ways. Papillon entered the Guajira peninsula, a region dominated by Amerindians. He was assimilated into a coastal village whose specialty was pearl diving. There he married two teenage sisters and impregnated both. After spending several months in relative paradise, Papillon decided to seek vengeance against those who had wronged him.

Soon after leaving the village, Papillon was captured and imprisoned at Santa Marta, then transferred to Barranquilla. There, he was reunited with Clousiot and Maturette. Papillon made numerous escape attempts from this prison, all of which failed. He was eventually extradited to French Guiana.

As punishment, Papillon was sentenced to two years of solitary confinement on Île Saint-Joseph (an island in the Îles du Salut group, 11 kilometers (7 miles) from the French Guiana coast). Clousiot and Maturette were given the same sentence. Upon his release, Papillon was transferred to Royal Island (also an island in the Îles du Salut group). An escape attempt was foiled by an informant (whom Papillon stabbed to death). Papillon had to endure another 19 months of solitary confinement. His original sentence of eight years was reduced after Papillon risked his life to save a girl caught in shark-infested waters.

After French Guiana officials decided to support the pro-Nazi Vichy Regime, the penalty for escape attempts was death, or capital punishment. Papillon decided to feign insanity in order to be sent to the asylum on Royal Island. Insane prisoners could not be sentenced to death for any reason, and the asylum was not as heavily guarded as Devil&#x27;s Island. He collaborated on another escape attempt but it failed; the other prisoner drowned when their boat was destroyed against rocks. Papillon nearly died as well.

Papillon returned to the regular prisoner population on Royal Island after being &quot;cured&quot; of his mental illness. He asked to be transferred to Devil&#x27;s Island, the smallest and considered the most &quot;inescapable&quot; island in the Îles de Salut group. Papillon studied the waters and discovered possibilities at a rocky inlet surrounded by a high cliff. He noticed that every seventh wave was large enough to carry a floating object far enough out into the sea that it would drift toward the mainland. He experimented by throwing sacks of coconuts into the inlet.

He found another prisoner to accompany him, a pirate named Sylvain. He had sailed in southeast Asia, where he was known to raid ships, killing everyone aboard for their money and goods. The two men jumped into the inlet, using sacks of coconuts for flotation. The seventh wave carried them out into the ocean. After days of drifting under the relentless sun, surviving on coconut pulp, they made landfall at the mainland. Sylvain sank in quicksand after having abandoned his coconut sack.

On the mainland, Papillon encountered Cuic Cuic, who had built a hut on an &quot;island&quot;. The hut was set on solid ground surrounded by quicksand; Cuic Cuic depended on a pig to find the safe route over the quicksand. The men and the pig made their way to Georgetown, British Guiana, by boat. Papillon decided to continue to the northwest in the company of five other escapees. Reaching Venezuela, the men were captured and imprisoned at mobile detention camps in the vicinity of El Dorado, a small mining town near the Gran Sabana region. Surviving harsh conditions there, and finding diamonds, Papillon was eventually released. He gained Venezuelan citizenship and celebrity status a few years later.

== The impact of &quot;Papillon&quot; ==

The book was an immediate sensation and bestseller, achieving widespread fame and critical acclaim. Upon publication it spent 21 weeks as number 1 bestseller in France, with more than 1.5 million copies sold in France alone. 239 editions of the book have since been published worldwide, in 21 different languages.

The book was first published in France by Robert Laffont in 1969, and first published in Great Britain by Rupert Hart-Davis in 1970, with an English translation by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. The book was adapted for a Hollywood film of the same name in 1973, starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, as well as another in 2017, starring Charlie Hunnam and Rami Malek. Charrière also published a sequel to &quot;Papillon&quot;, called &quot;Banco&quot;, in 1973.

&quot;Papillon&quot; has been described as &quot;The greatest adventure story of all time&quot; (Auguste Le Breton) and &quot;A modern classic of courage and excitement&quot; (Janet Flanner, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;).

<text>John Warren Vanderslice (born May 22, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, record producer, and recording engineer. He is the owner and founder of Tiny Telephone, an analog recording studio in North Oakland. He has released sixteen full-length studio albums and five remix records and EPs on Dead Oceans and Barsuk Records and has collaborated with musicians such as the Mountain Goats, St. Vincent, and Spoon.

==Early years==
Vanderslice grew up in rural North Florida before his family moved to Maryland when he was 11. In 1989, he graduated with a degree in economics from the University of Maryland, where he also studied art history. Vanderslice moved to San Francisco in 1990. While supporting himself as a waiter, Vanderslice took classes at University of California, Berkeley, with the intention of becoming an English teacher. Vanderslice then spent five years as a member of the experimental band Mk Ultra, with whom he released three albums in the 1990s. The last of these, &quot;The Dream Is Over&quot;, received a 9.2 from Pitchfork.

In 1997, he founded Tiny Telephone, a 3,000 sq. ft., two-room recording studio in the Mission District of San Francisco. The studio was initially used as a rehearsal space before being developed as a full-time, all-analog recording studio. Bands who recorded in the studio included Death Cab for Cutie, Sleater-Kinney, Okkervil River, Deerhoof, The Mountain Goats, The Magnetic Fields, Tune-yards, and Spoon. The original studio closed in 2020, with Vanderslice saying that despite being booked year-round it was no longer financially solvent. However, an Oakland location of Tiny Telephone, opened in 2015, continues to operate.

==Solo career==
In 2000, Vanderslice released his first solo album, &quot;Mass Suicide Occult Figurines&quot;, and briefly gained some national media attention for the single &quot;Bill Gates Must Die&quot; after concocting a hoax in which Microsoft supposedly threatened legal action over the song; Vanderslice had trouble manufacturing the CD because the artwork resembled that of a Windows installation disc, and at least one manufacturer was wary of legal action. During the controversy, he was interviewed by &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. 

&quot;Time Travel Is Lonely&quot; and &quot;Life and Death of an American Fourtracker&quot; followed in 2001 and 2002 respectively, followed by 2004&#x27;s &quot;Cellar Door&quot;.

Many songs on the 2005 album &quot;Pixel Revolt&quot; referenced the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Iraq War and were more overtly political in their lyrical content. The album earned an 8.3 rating on Pitchfork and was cited for its &quot;meticulous arrangements&quot; with &quot;everything in its right place&quot;, and declared an &quot;excellent album&quot;. The album&#x27;s ending resolves the narrator&#x27;s struggles with acute depression (&quot;Dead Slate Pacific&quot;) and suicidal thoughts (&quot;The Golden Gate&quot;) with a love song to psychotropic drugs (&quot;CRC 7173, Affectionately&quot;).

The title of Vanderslice&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Emerald City&quot;, references both the nickname of the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad and the name of the city in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He has said about the album: &quot;I was so beaten down after the 2000 election and after 9/11 and then the invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan; I was so depleted as a person after all that stuff happened, that I had to write my way out of it. I really had to write political songs because for me it is a way of making sense and processing what is going on.&quot; &quot;Emerald City&quot; achieved a score of 82/100 on Metacritic. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;a gleaming gem&quot; that doesn&#x27;t disappoint. &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s review of the record called Vanderslice an &quot;always perceptive lyricist&quot;. Calling Vanderslice a &quot;master story-teller&quot;, Matt Fink of &quot;Paste&quot; said that &quot;Emerald City&quot; was &quot;vividly imagined yet subtle in tone, with conflicted character sketches unfolding around somber synth melodies, creaky electronic effects, and fuzzy acoustic guitar strums.&quot;

In 2009, with &quot;Romanian Names&quot;, Vanderslice broke away from overtly political lyrical content characteristic of previous albums and turned his focus to personal reflections on romance and a modern person’s relationship to the natural landscape. Maintaining his commitment to fully analog production, Vanderslice recorded guitar and piano tracks for this album in his analog basement studio of his San Francisco home. He completed further instrumentation and production at his own Tiny Telephone recording studio with producer Scott Solter.

In 2010, Vanderslice released a free EP called &quot;Green Grow The Rushes&quot;.

A full album, &quot;White Wilderness&quot;, was released on January 25, 2011, on Dead Oceans. Here, Vanderslice forwent his usual meticulous process of manipulating and heavily over-dubbing tracks in the recording studio, in favor a pared-down production style. He recorded the album live with Minna Choi and the 19-member Magik*Magik Orchestra, the house orchestra of Tiny Telephone, in three days at Berkeley’s historically-renowned Fantasy Studios. Vanderslice wrote acoustic versions of each song, while Choi wrote all orchestral arrangements. The collaboration resulted in a looser sound that maintained the structural complexity and pop sensibility of Vanderslice’s previous songwriting. Lyrically, Vanderslice reflects on his trajectory as a musician and performer and draws inspiration from the California landscape. &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot; recounts early memories of learning to play the piano as a child, while &quot;After It Ends&quot; imagines a performer destroying and escaping his venue at the end of a show. The romping &quot;Convict Lake&quot; is an autobiographical account of an overdose on LSD during a camping trip at this Sierra Nevada, California, lake. It was produced and recorded by John Congleton.

In January 2012, Vanderslice left his record contract with Dead Oceans. He created a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to start his own label and reached his $18,500 goal within hours of starting the campaign, which ultimately resulted in his ninth album, &quot;Dagger Beach&quot;.

With &quot;Dagger Beach&quot;, Vanderslice pushed experimentation with analog production techniques to the forefront of his songwriting. For some songs, including &quot;Harlequin Press&quot; and &quot;Damage Control&quot;, he tried to avoid familiar song structures by writing over improvised drum parts played by longtime collaborator Jason Slota. On the album, Vanderslice revisits the theme of navigating the California landscape as a metaphor for personal relationships: &quot;Raw Wood&quot; reflects on solo camping in Wildcat camp of Point Reyes National Park, while &quot;North Coast Rep&quot; describes a disintegrating friendship by way of a found photograph of the Sonoma, California, landscape.

In conjunction with &quot;Dagger Beach&quot;, Vanderslice released his own full cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. The idea for the cover album came in August 2012, when Vanderslice performed &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; in full at the Vogue Theater in San Francisco, followed by a screening of Michel Gondry&#x27;s cult classic, &quot;The Science of Sleep&quot;. After intensive rehearsing for a single show with a limited audience, Vanderslice decided to channel his creative efforts with Bowie&#x27;s original material into an entire cover version of the album. It was released on limited edition vinyl in June 2013. Using the original album as a backbone to experiment and improvise in the recording studio with collaborators, Vanderslice altered lyrics, song structures, chord progressions, and titles of many of the songs.

With full control of the production and distribution of his self-released albums and a commitment to quality control, Vanderslice had both &quot;Dagger Beach&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; pressed on 200-gram vinyl by audiophile Quality Record Pressings plant. In response to widespread music file sharing and in an effort to control sound quality of distributed files, he has made high-quality music files of many self-released songs freely available online.

In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Vanderslice stated that a near-death experience in 2014, in which the van he was touring in almost flipped on Interstate 80 in Ohio, prompted him to quit touring and making records. Surviving the incident was a life-altering experience: &quot;After that happened, maybe a second later, I was like, I’m done. I don’t want to die in a van. It wasn’t sad, it wasn’t celebratory. It was just like, eh, I had a good run.&quot;

Vanderslice began touring again in 2018 with Undertow Music, performing a series of house shows. His album &quot;The Cedars&quot; also released that year would be his last album fully recorded and mixed by analog means of production. His following albums are almost all recorded digitally in his small backyard studio in Los Angeles including &quot;Dollar Hits&quot; (2020) and &quot;d E A T h ~ b U g&quot; (2021).

In 2021, Vanderslice self-released his first fully electronic record. &quot;CRYSTALS 3.0&quot; is the culmination of a span of experimentation with harsh noise and drugs, curious samples and cascading sequencers. A seamless 19-minute sequence of melodies, meticulous static bursts, and spring-loaded beats, &quot;CRYSTALS 3.0&quot; applies the unencumbered enthusiasm of vintage Vanderslice records to his ideas about breaking old molds, about avoiding easy interpretation.

Those samples populate &quot;CRYSTALS 3.0&quot; like reawakened ghosts, maybe guests of honor at one of the drug parties Vanderslice throws in the backyard with his wife, Maria Vanderslice. The whole dense little record &quot;feels like a distilled fête&quot;, its 13 overlapping tracks functioning as fragments from conversations and encounters.

==Recording technique and collaborations==
Vanderslice is a proponent of using analog instruments and recording equipment to produce a richer, more raw sound, which he has sometimes called &quot;sloppy hi-fi&quot;. He has collaborated closely with engineer/producers in the production of his albums, including John Congleton, Scott Solter, and John Croslin.

Since 2014, Vanderslice has been a full-time record producer at Tiny Telephone and has worked with Frog Eyes, Samantha Crain, the Mountain Goats, and Grandaddy. He has previously worked with Sophie Hunger, Bombadil, Strand of Oaks, and Spoon. Currently, he rarely takes on production work to focus on his own music.

In 2020, Vanderslice almost entirely pivoted away from analog recording and has become an advocate for the freedom of experimentation afforded by digital recording.

Vanderslice was a contributing producer on the Spoon album, &quot;Gimme Fiction&quot;, and also produced The Mountain Goats albums &quot;We Shall All Be Healed&quot;, &quot;The Sunset Tree&quot;, and &quot;Heretic Pride&quot;. In March and April 2009, he toured alongside The Mountain Goats&#x27; John Darnielle in the &quot;Gone Primitive Tour&quot;. These shows featured Vanderslice and Darnielle each playing acoustic sets and then performing material together.

On several occasions, Vanderslice has chosen bands to tour with him who have gone on to widespread recognition and critical respect, including Sufjan Stevens, Okkervil River, The Tallest Man On Earth, and St. Vincent.

==Influences and interests==
Vanderslice is heavily influenced by film and is a fan of David Lynch and Ingmar Bergman. His song &quot;Promising Actress&quot; references the film &quot;Mulholland Drive (film)&quot;. His 2004 release, &quot;Cellar Door&quot; is inspired by and largely written about the 2001 film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. He is a prolific amateur photographer, and has taken publicity photos for Thao Nguyen, The Mountain Goats, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, and Mirah. He has also had his work used as album artwork by Matt Nathanson, Carey Mercer of Frog Eyes, and Mobius Band, as well as for his own 2009 release, &quot;Romanian Names&quot;.

John Vanderslice has radically changed the style of music he creates since shifting away from analog recording in 2020, citing his modern musical influences as Arca (musician), JPEGMafia, Autechre, and Modeselektor.

<doc id="872384" wikidata="Q6389877" url="?curid=872384" title="Kenneth Boulding's evolutionary perspective">
<text>[[Kenneth E. Boulding]]&#x27;s evolutionary perspective is an approach to economics (see also evolutionary economics) put forward most completely in his &quot;Ecodynamics&quot; (1978) and &quot;Evolutionary Economics&quot; (1981) had roots in his 1934 work on population theory and the age structure of capital as well as his &quot;Reconstruction&quot; (1950) with chapter titles like &quot;An Ecological Introduction&quot; and &quot;The Theory of the Economic Organism.&quot;

==Perspectives==

One of the first major perspectives of Boulding&#x27;s evolutionary perspective was his emphasis on know-how or, to use the term of Vladimir Vernadsky (1926) and Teilhard de Chardin (1959), which Boulding used as well, the &quot;Noosphere.&quot; This is the counterpart in social and economic evolution to the role of genetic information and DNA in biological evolution. Just as DNA provides the genetic know-how to produce a chicken from an egg, automotive engineers and their recording devices contain the know-how to produce an automobile.

One of the first major neoclassical casualties of this perspective comes from Boulding&#x27;s critique of the usual factors of production, land, labor and capital:
It is much more accurate to identify the factors of production as know-how (that is genetic information structure), energy, and materials, for, as we have seen, all processes of production involve the direction of energy by some know-how structure toward the selection, transportation, and transformation of materials into the product. 
&quot;Labor&quot; is a category marginally useful to Boulding for studying distribution, but of no use whatever for studying production. Boulding&#x27;s factors of production are know-how, materials and energy; hence, a theory which holds labor—a heterogeneous collection of artifacts of know-how, energy and materials—as the source of value in the production process has &quot;all the scientific validity of the medieval elements of earth, air, fire, and water.&quot;

Another former president of the American Economic Association, Georgescu-Roegen, also began to dissent from orthodox economics for reasons not dissimilar to Boulding. In his classic work, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, Georgescu-Roegen issued a call for the end of the circular flow diagrams used in mainstream thought and textbooks in which the production and circulation process are detached from the physical reality, the scale, of the planet&#x27;s resources and pollution sinks. He called for greater attention to be given to the second law of thermodynamics – that it be treated as a cornerstone of the mainstream paradigm. Boulding can be seen as addressing this call. Once one considers the possibility that labor can be seen as an intermediate surrogate for more fundamental factors, like know-how, materials and energy, then it is a short step to treat (as Boulding sometimes does) capital as a surrogate for know-how and land as surrogate for material resources and the traditional factors of production, land, labor and capital, are easily rearticulated as know-how, energy and materials. If and when that sort of transformation in thought takes place, professional attention will immediately be focused on the throughput resulting from the production and consumption process. With the rising perception of environmental degradation and the unrelenting thrust of the environmental movement, there is every reason to expect the profession to include throughput as a centerpiece in the production process. Boulding&#x27;s factors of production accomplish this task.

==Post-civilized society==

Once the traditional factor of production (i.e. capital) is reinterpreted as know-how, one can easily conclude that know-how and the growth of knowledge are &quot;the essential key to economic development. Investment, financial systems and economic organizations and institutions are in a sense only the machinery by which a knowledge process is created and expressed.&quot; (&quot;Economic Development as an Evolutionary System&quot;). Boulding (1961) (1964) embedded his view of development in a long-term perspective that envisages us as moving from our current &quot;civilized society&quot; to &quot;post-civilized society&quot;. The driving force of this movement is science or the culture that supports science. Development of the third world is a critical part of the movement to a &quot;post-civilized society&quot;.

His &quot;post-civilized society&quot; is not the stationary state of John Stuart Mill or Herman Daly, but it does have a stable population. As a young man in his twenties, Boulding took a position that we now refer to as neo-Malthusian. He argued that &quot;the indication seems to be&quot; that the (per-capita) income level at which the western world would only reproduce itself is one &quot;that the actual standard of life can never reach.&quot; (1939, 107) Thirty years later, still prior to Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s Population Bomb (1969) and the limits-to-growth literature (e.g., Meadows, 1971), Boulding argued (1965) that it &quot;is hard to avoid considerable pessimism&quot; about the prospects of development, especially in countries with high birth rates, which could undermine the great potential of a post-civilized society.

His major contribution to this problem is probably the argument (1964) for tradable birth-right permits. His dissidence on this issue is &quot;political&quot; – it runs against the grain of the political climate both then and now. If he was correct about the emerging seriousness of the population problem and if that level of concern is one day reflected in popular political sentiment, there is every reason to expect the profession to embrace Boulding&#x27;s call for tradable birth-right permits, since it is based squarely on neoclassical concern for efficiency.

==Criticism of mainstream economists==

Boulding is widely known for his criticism of mainstream economists&#x27; use of equilibrium analysis and, in particular, for the profession&#x27;s acceptance of what Boulding calls &quot;Samuelson&#x27;s dynamics&quot; (originating with the Foundations (1947)). To appreciate his position, it is important to reflect on the different time scales in biological evolution and what Boulding calls social or societal evolution. With the advent of the human capacity for developing complex images (1950), social evolution has proceeded orders of magnitude faster than biological evolution. Changes, for example, in the size of the human brain have occurred orders of magnitude more slowly than social and economic changes in the last ten millennia.

Yet slower than biological evolution is the time scale of astronomical change. The relations among the celestial bodies of the solar system were first depicted mathematically by Newton. The precision with which the field of celestial mechanics is able to describe the movements of bodies of the solar system is due to the incredibly slow time scale of astronomical, evolutionary change. Boulding&#x27;s longstanding concern was that equilibrium analysis, market dynamics and growth theory as practised in conventional economics are based on the mathematics of difference and differential equations, as found in celestial mechanics.

Along with his critique of equilibrium analysis, he has the following critique with the profession&#x27;s methodological emphasis on prediction as being the criterion of good theory: 
Prediction of the future is possible only in systems that have stable parameters like celestial mechanics. The only reason why prediction is so successful in celestial mechanics is that the evolution of the solar system has ground to a halt in what is essentially a dynamic equilibrium with stable parameters. Evolutionary systems, however, by their very nature have unstable parameters. They are disequilibrium systems and in such systems our power of prediction, though not zero, is very limited because of the unpredictability of the parameters themselves. If, of course, it were possible to predict the change in the parameters, then there would be other parameters which were unchanged, but the search for ultimately stable parameters in evolutionary systems is futile, for they probably do not exist... Social systems have Heisenberg principles all over the place, for we cannot predict the future without changing it. 

There is a fundamental theorem in information theory that says information has to be surprising. Equilibrium can&#x27;t exist in a system in which information is an essential element. The parameters are always changing. I describe econometrics as the attempt to find the celestial mechanics of non-existent universes. (1991) 

Biological evolution gives considerable emphasis to the ability of organisms to adapt to unpredictable change—their survival value. In his words, 

:...the perception of potential threats to survival may be much more important in determining behavior than the perceptions of potential profits, so that profit maximization is not really the driving force. It is fear of loss rather than hope of gain that limits our behavior.

Boulding&#x27;s observation or conjecture was made prior to widespread adoption of the same
idea by economists in the eighties following work done in psychology
in the seventies for which a 
Nobel prize was awarded in 2002.

<doc id="872386" wikidata="Q596965" url="?curid=872386" title="Papillon (1973 film)">
<text>Papillon is a 1973 historical adventure drama prison film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. The screenplay by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. was based on the 1969 autobiography by the French convict Henri Charrière. The film stars Steve McQueen as Charrière (&quot;Papillon&quot;) and Dustin Hoffman as Louis Dega. Because it was filmed at remote locations, the film was quite expensive for the time ($12 million), but it earned more than twice that in its first year of release. The film&#x27;s title is French for &quot;Butterfly&quot;, referring to Charrière&#x27;s tattoo and nickname.

== Plot ==
Henri Charrière is a safecracker nicknamed &quot;Papillon&quot; because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. In France, he is wrongly convicted of murdering a pimp in 1933 and is sentenced to life imprisonment in French Guiana. En route, he meets a fellow convict, Louis Dega, an infamous forger and embezzler. Papillon offers to protect Dega if he will fund the former&#x27;s escape once they reach Guiana. Enduring the horrors of life in a jungle labour camp, the two become friends.

One day, Papillon defends Dega from a sadistic guard and escapes into the jungle but is captured and sentenced to two years in solitary confinement. In gratitude, Dega has extra food smuggled to Papillon. When the smuggling is discovered, the warden screens Papillon&#x27;s cell in darkness for six months and halves his rations, but Papillon refuses to give up Dega&#x27;s name. He is eventually released and sent to the infirmary in St-Laurent-du-Maroni to recover.

Papillon sees Dega again and asks him to arrange for another escape attempt. Dega helps him meet an inmate doctor who offers to secure a boat on the outside with the help of a man named Pascal. Fellow prisoner Clusiot and a gay orderly named André Maturette join the escape plot. During the escape, Clusiot is knocked unconscious by a guard. Dega subdues the guard and reluctantly joins Papillon and Maturette, climbing the walls to the outside. The trio meet Pascal, and they escape into the night. In the jungle the next day, Pascal delivers the prisoners to their boat, but after he leaves, the convicts discover it is fake. They encounter a local trapper who has killed the bounty hunters waiting for them. He guides the three to a leper colony, where they obtain supplies and a seaworthy boat.

The trio lands in Colombia and are accosted by a group of soldiers, who wound Maturette. He is captured along with Dega, while Papillon evades the soldiers and lives for a long period with a native tribe. He awakens one morning to find them gone, leaving him with a small sack of pearls. Papillon pays a nun to take him to her convent, where he asks the Mother Superior for refuge, but instead, she turns him over to the authorities.

Papillon is returned to French Guiana and sentenced to another five years of solitary confinement. He emerges a graying old man, along with Maturette, whom he sees just before the latter dies. Papillon is moved to the remote Devil&#x27;s Island, where he reunites with Dega, who has long given up hope of being released.

From a high cliff, Papillon observes a cove where he realizes the waves are powerful enough to carry a man out to sea and to the nearby mainland. Papillon persuades Dega to join him in another escape, and the men make two floats from bagged-up coconuts. Dega then decides not to escape and begs Papillon not to either. Papillon embraces Dega, then leaps from the cliff and is carried out to sea.

A narrator states that Papillon lived the rest of his life a free man, while the prison was eventually closed.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

After the publication of &quot;Papillon&quot; in 1969, a bidding war started between Avco-Embassy Pictures, Continental Distributing, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and numerous French film companies for the film rights. Continental Distributing won the rights for $500,000, with the intent to hire Roman Polanski as director and Warren Beatty as lead actor, but the studio&#x27;s funding fell through. It sold the rights to producer Robert Dorfmann, who initially intended to hire Terence Young as director and Charles Bronson as star, before turning to Franklin J. Schaffner and Steve McQueen. The film&#x27;s first screenplay by William Goldman, which was more faithful to the book than the final film, was rewritten by Lorenzo Semple Jr. to expand the role of Louis Dega, in an attempt to convince Dustin Hoffman to join the cast and eliminate depictions of homosexuality among prisoners. After Hoffman&#x27;s casting, Dalton Trumbo further rewrote the screenplay. Ratna Assan made her film debut in &quot;Papillon&quot; by portraying an indigenous woman named Zoraima, which resulted in extreme censorship when the film was screened in Indonesia.

&quot;Papillon&quot; was filmed at various locations in Spain and Jamaica, with the cave scenes filmed beneath what is now the Xtabi hotel on the cliffs of Negril. The town scenes near the beginning of the film were shot in Hondarribia, Spain. The St-Laurent-du-Maroni penal colony scenes were filmed in Falmouth, Jamaica, and the swamp scenes were shot near Ferris Cross. Interior scenes were shot in Montego Bay, while other scenes were filmed in Kingston, Ocho Rios and Savanna-la-Mar.

Most of the French prisoners on the island were portrayed by German-Jamaican extras. Steve McQueen&#x27;s famous cliff-jumping scene near the film&#x27;s climax took place from the cliffs in Maui, Hawaii. McQueen insisted on performing the cliff-jumping stunt himself.
 He later said it was &quot;one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life&quot;.

McQueen was paid $2 million, along with the contractual stipulation that he receive first billing over Dustin Hoffman. In addition, author Henri Charrière acted as consultant on location, apprising the filmmakers of the things he encountered during his years of imprisonment.

The Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni, where Henri Charrière was held, and where most of the action takes place, was faithfully recreated using the original blueprints. Footage of the historic prison in French Guiana plays under the end credits, which is shown to be abandoned and covered in jungle growth.

== Soundtrack ==
The score to &quot;Papillon&quot; was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith. It was recorded in Rome, Italy, at the Ortophonic Recording Studio by the &quot;Unione Musicisti Roma Orchestra&quot;. The film marked Goldsmith&#x27;s fourth (of seven) collaboration with director Franklin J. Schaffner, following his Academy Award-nominated scores to &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Patton&quot;. Both the director and composer shared the belief that film music should be used economically. They wanted the music as commentary only, in sequences in which it can emphasize the psychological aspects of the film. In &quot;Papillon,&quot; the film is two and a half hours long, but has 40 minutes with music.

Goldsmith&#x27;s compositions, characterized by a late romantic symphonic and impressionistic style suffused with a metered, exotic timbre (using instruments from Caribbean folk music), are distributed mainly in the second half of the film. They generally accompany scenes outside the prison, during the various escape attempts by the protagonist. He used a delicate melodic approach, dominated by a very catchy theme expressed as a waltz, which was often played using an accordion. The instrument was associated with the French origin of the protagonists. The theme song became famous with the popularity of the film, and it was released in many variations by different record companies.

The score was partially released on vinyl in 1973 and reissued over the years. In the 21st century, an edition was released on CD by Universal Records in France. For the first time, it was the complete version of music from the film (including about five minutes of previously unreleased tracks). The DVD of the English-language version of the film includes an option to listen to Goldsmith&#x27;s music as an isolated audio track.

Goldsmith earned his sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score for this soundtrack. It was one of the American Film Institute&#x27;s 250 nominated soundtracks for the top 25 American film scores.

== Box office ==
The film was a commercial success and grossed $3,126,574 in its opening week. It earned theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada of $21.3 million.

== Critical reception ==
Roger Ebert&#x27;s review at the film&#x27;s original release was two stars out of four. He said that the main flaw was a failure to gain audience interest in McQueen&#x27;s and Hoffman&#x27;s characters: &quot;You know something has gone wrong when you want the hero to escape simply so that the movie can be over.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don&#x27;t often find in movies anymore.&quot;

Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;For 150 uninterrupted minutes, the mood is one of despair, brutality, and little hope. On a professional level, the Allied Artists release is expert in all creative and technical areas. On an audience level, it is a relentless downer.&quot;

Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and called it &quot;just plain boring&quot;.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;Papillon&#x27; is an eloquent tribute to the indomitability of the human spirit and a powerful indictment of those institutions dedicated only to breaking it. As such, it&#x27;s lots easier to admire than to enjoy.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a keen disappointment ... this lumbering vehicle directed by Franklin J. Schaffner leaves Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman stranded on the screen while opportunities for vivid filmmaking and sympathetic characterizations are bungled at every turn.&quot;

Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;what is missing is any of the book&#x27;s anger at the outrageous hypocrisy, injustice and inhumanity of the system; any of the passion which feeds Papillon&#x27;s compulsion to escape.&quot;

In a contemporary review, Quentin Tarantino called it &quot;a pretty iconic film for boys my age who saw it when it came out... The film is very involving. It contains maybe McQueen&#x27;s finest serious acting moment on film, when he sticks his head out of the solitary confinement door and is not only unrecognizable but completely deranged. And the film contains one of the most powerful time cuts I&#x27;ve ever seen in a motion picture. The film&#x27;s also not a little pretentious, self consciously arty, unrelentingly grim, extremely grueling and except for Dustin Hoffman keeping a bankroll and an extra pair of spectacles up his ass, completely devoid of any entertainment value.&quot;

&quot;Papillon&quot; holds a 73% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1974, the film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Original Dramatic Score (Jerry Goldsmith) and a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actor, Drama (Steve McQueen).

== In popular culture ==
The song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Island&quot;, by the American heavy metal band Megadeth, written by lead singer Dave Mustaine, was inspired by this film, and appeared on the band&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot;.

The song, &quot;Human Insecticide&quot;, by the Canadian thrash metal band Annihilator from their 1989 album, &quot;Alice in Hell&quot;, was inspired by this film.

The Editors song, &quot;Papillon&quot;, from their 2009 album, &quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot;, opens with the line, &quot;Make our escape, you&#x27;re my own papillon&quot;.

Mark Kozelek and Desertshore recorded a song called &quot;Hey You Bastards I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, named after Papillon&#x27;s last quote from the film, spoken in voiceover before the closing credits start.

A parody of &quot;Papillon&quot;, &quot;Farfallon&quot;, is a 1974 Italian comedy film directed by Riccardo Pazzaglia.

== 2017 film ==

Another film based on the autobiographies of Charrière and the 1973 film, also called &quot;Papillon&quot;, was released in 2017, directed by Danish director Michael Noer. Charlie Hunnam played the lead role of Henri Charrière, and Rami Malek played Louis Dega. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2017.

<text>Margaret Kernochan Leech (November 7, 1893 – February 24, 1974), also known as Margaret Pulitzer, was an American historian and fiction writer. She won the Pulitzer Prize for History both in 1942 (&quot;Reveille in Washington&quot;, Harper) (first woman to win for history) and in 1960 (&quot;In the Days of McKinley&quot;, Harper).

==Life and career==
She was born in Newburgh, New York, obtained an A.B. from Vassar College in 1915, and worked for fund-raising organizations during World War I, including the American Committee for Devastated France.

She started her writing career for the Condé Nast publishing company before World War I. Leech also worked in advertising and publicity. After the war, she became friendly with members of the Algonquin Round Table, including critic-raconteur Alexander Woollcott. 

On August 1, 1928 she married Ralph Pulitzer, publisher of the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper. (His father, Joseph Pulitzer, had established the Pulitzer Prize by a bequest to Columbia University.) They had one daughter, Susan.

&quot;Reveille in Washington, 1860–1865&quot;, is an account of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War and deals with, among other things, Abraham Lincoln and his wife, along with Rose Greenhow, the Confederate spy whose work was helpful in the Southern forces winning the First Battle of Bull Run. Passages from the book are quoted in George Saunders&#x27; novel, &quot;Lincoln In The Bardo&quot; (2016).

&quot;In the Days of McKinley&quot; is a biography of President William McKinley, carefully told in minute detail, and he is shown as a more attractive person and better president than some have depicted him. In addition to the history Pulitzer, the book was awarded the Bancroft Prize in 1960.

Leech also wrote three novels: &quot;The Back of the Book&quot; (1924), &quot;Tin Wedding&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Feathered Nest&quot; (1928) and, in 1927, co-wrote a biography of Anthony Comstock with Heywood Broun.

Leech died of a stroke in New York City at age 80.

<text>Nikola Vitov Gučetić (, ; 1549–1610) was a Ragusan statesman, polymath, philosopher, science writer and author of one of the first scientific dissertations regarding speleology.

==Life==
Gučetić was born in Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia), into the Gučetić (Gozze) noble family, being kin of the earlier writer Đivo Gučetić (1451–1502). He received most of his education in Dubrovnik and Italy. He was the central person in the cultural life in Dubrovnik in his time and owned probably the biggest private library in town.

Rarely traveling outside the limits of town, he was occupied by trade, finances, and other official duties for the city-state. Elected Rector of the Republic of Ragusa seven times at the turn of the 17th century, he devoted his life to the prosperity of the city.

Pope Clement VIII awarded him an honorary doctorate in philosophy as well as master&#x27;s degree in theology. Gozze was highly regarded for his works related to philosophy, politics, sociology, and pedagogy.

Gučetić married Marija Gundulić-Gučetić, who was a philosopher too, and wrote &quot;La querelle des femmes u renesansnom Dubrovniku&quot;. The dedication written in her husband&#x27;s book &quot;Discorsi di m. Nicolò ; Vito di Gozze sopra le metheore d&#x27;Aristotile. Ridotti in dialogo e divisi in quatro giornate&quot; under the title &quot;Alla non men bella, che virtuosa e gentil donna Fiore Zuzori in Ragugia&quot; Venetiis, 1582, is an extraordinary discourse in Ragusan heritage, given in the first place in the defence of the authors&#x27; friend Cvijeta Zuzorić (&quot;Fiore Zuzori&quot;) but also the other women. Marija was uncompromisingly critical towards the Dubrovnik society that attacked her friend. Her criticism was so sharp that censorship was imposed on it. Marija&#x27;s dedication has a theoretical value as well because it constitutes a part of a huge debate on the worth of women led in Europe from the 14th century on. The article puts her text in the context of this debate.

==Works==
Gučetić wrote in the Italian and Latin:
*&quot;Commentaria in sermonem Auer. De substantia orbis, et in propositiones de causis&quot; 1580
*&quot;Dialogo d&#x27;amore detto Antos, secondo la mente di Platone&quot; 1581
*&quot;Dialogo della Bellezza detto Antos, secondo la mente di Platone&quot; 1581
* &quot;Sopra le Metheore d&#x27; Aristotile&quot; (&quot;About Aristotle&#x27;s meteors&quot;), first in 1584 and in 1585 the second edition, in Venice.
** This work is a comment on explanations of natural phenomena according to the principles of natural philosophy given by Aristotle.
*&quot;Dello stato delle republiche secondo la mente di Aristotele&quot; 1591
*&quot;Discorsi della penitenza&quot; 1589
*&quot;Governo della famiglia&quot; 1589

==On winds and caves==
In a part of the book &quot;About Aristotle&#x27;s meteors&quot; relating to the meteorology which discuss the phenomenon of wind, the writer mentions two caves noted to generate very strong winds at their entrances:
* &quot;Šipun cave&quot; near Cavtat in the Dubrovnik area
* An unnamed cave in Popovo polje in Herzegovina – most probably today&#x27;s Vjetrenica cave (vjetar=wind)

Based on these observations, Gučetić explained the origin of winds in general and winds in some caves by the process of evaporation of the Earth&#x27;s elements which is caused by the Sun. Being warm, dryer and denser, the evaporation medium is unable to penetrate the Earth through its surface, but only through the large openings and that is what produces wind. Gučetić noted that wind cannot be observed deeper inside the cave, but only at the entrance. He explained that by the acceleration of the air current in narrower passages, similar to that one of the sea current in narrow sea passages.

In the case of a windless &quot;šipun cave&quot;, Gučetić stated that this phenomenon is not universal for all caves. He explained the absence of wind on its entrance by its higher humidity and presence of a lake in one or more of possible passages. According to his opinion, the bigger amount of water is favorable for the growth of stygobites and troglobites which are abundant in the šipun cave.

<doc id="872402" wikidata="Q278106" url="?curid=872402" title="Chalcocite">
<text>Chalcocite (), copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S), is an important copper ore mineral. It is opaque and dark gray to black, with a metallic luster. It has a hardness of 2.5–3 on the Mohs scale. It is a sulfide with a monoclinic crystal system.

The term &quot;chalcocite&quot; from the Greek &quot;khalkos&quot;, meaning &quot;copper&quot;. It is also known as redruthite, vitreous copper, or copper-glance.

==Occurrence==
Chalcocite is sometimes found as a primary vein mineral in hydrothermal veins. However, most chalcocite occurs in the supergene enriched environment below the oxidation zone of copper deposits as a result of the leaching of copper from the oxidized minerals. It is also often found in sedimentary rocks.

It has been mined for centuries and is one of the most profitable copper ores. The reasons for this is its high copper content (66.7% atomic ratio and nearly 80% by weight) and the ease at which copper can be separated from sulfur. 
Since chalcocite is a secondary mineral that forms from the alteration of other minerals, it has been known to form pseudomorphs of many different minerals. A pseudomorph is a mineral that has replaced another mineral atom by atom, but it leaves the original mineral&#x27;s crystal shape intact. Chalcocite has been known to form pseudomorphs of the minerals bornite, covellite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, enargite, millerite, galena and sphalerite.

<doc id="872403" wikidata="Q299449" url="?curid=872403" title="Ema Pukšec">
<text>Ema Pukšec (February 6, 1834 – January 14, 1889), also known as Ilma de Murska, as well as Ilma di Murska, was a 19th-century soprano opera singer from Croatia.

==Life==
Ema Pukšec was born in Ogulin (present-day Republic of Croatia). Her mother was Krescencia Brodarotti de Trauenfeld, while her father, Josip Pukšec, was a highly respected military officer stationed in the region around the city of Slunj. For his service in protecting the eastern flanks of western Europe within the Austrian Military Frontier, her father was granted nobility and added the extension &quot;Murski&quot; to his name. The feminine variant (&quot;de Murska&quot;) was later used by Ema as her own surname.

She began playing the piano at the age of five. After her family moved to Zagreb in 1850, she started to sing, hoping for a later opera career. She married a soldier by the name of Josip Eder in 1851, with whom they had two children (Alfons and Hermina). They moved first to Graz in 1857, then to Vienna in 1860, in order to enable Ema to study voice in the city&#x27;s conservatory. She also studied for a time in Paris. Her professional career started in 1862 and lasted some 20 years.

==Career==
Ilma de Murska was a coloratura soprano with a range of three octaves. Her career as Ilma de Murska started in 1862 in Florence, Italy as Lady Harriet in Friedrich von Flotow&#x27;s &quot;Martha&quot;. Some sources claim she debuted as Marguerite de Valois in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. Her tour of Europe followed by performing in Budapest, Spain and Italy. After a string of 42 successful performances she went to Vienna as a guest artist and sang on August 16, 1864 in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;. Her period in Vienna closed on August 10, 1873 in a farewell performance, in which she played Ophelia in the very first performance of Ambroise Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Vienna Court Opera. Her most noted roles included the Queen of the Night in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. She also sang the roles of &quot;Dinorah&quot; and &quot;Isabella&quot; in &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;. 

===London===
Ilma de Murska&#x27;s London appearances were from 1865 until after 1873 and were generally in connection with James Henry Mapleson&#x27;s company. She made her London debut as Lucia di Lammermoor at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Her appearance as Queen of the Night in 1865 was a great success. George Bernard Shaw observed that, in the famous fioriturae of this role, she sang &quot;to chime with a delicate ring and inimitable precision of touch&quot;. In 1866 she sang Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Dinorah&quot;. That autumn she played Ophelia in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with Charles Santley and Karl Formes, in London and on tour.

In 1871 she was Isabella for Ernesto Nicolini&#x27;s English debut, in &quot;Robert le Diable&quot;. She also took part in Mapleson&#x27;s tours in Dublin between 1872 and 1876.

After leaving Vienna in 1873, de Murska performed in Hamburg, Berlin and Paris. In 1873-74, she toured United States. She also toured Russia, Australia and New Zealand, and for a period of time she lectured at the music conservatory in New York City.
In June 1875 she left for her Australasian tour, at which she gave 145 concerts, ten operas and two oratorios, clearing for herself £16,000, according to one account, of which she sent £11,000 to her daughter in Austria.
She married, almost certainly bigamously, the pianist Alfred Anderson in Sydney on 29 December 1875 during her Australian tour. She was obliged to break her schedule a few weeks later in Melbourne, as her husband was gravely ill. As a result, her fans in that city were treated to additional performances, in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;La Sonnambula&quot;, alternating nights with Fannie Simonsen. Anderson, who had been suffering intermittently before the marriage, died on 22 March.
Within two months, on 15 May 1876, while on tour in Dunedin, New Zealand, De Murska had married again, to John Hill, a friend and colleague of Anderson. This marriage lasted no longer than any of her others, as when de Murska returned to America in October 1876, Hill remained in Australia.

De Murska was noted for her hypersensitivity, especially about her age, and for the large menagerie of animals which accompanied her everywhere. Most important of these was an immense black Newfoundland dog called Pluto, which was trained to eat fowl off a plate, set for him as a place at the dining table with his mistress, without dripping anything on the tablecloth. He customarily travelled in a first-class carriage. His constant travelling-associates were two parrots, an Angora cat, and a monkey. The monkey and cat tormented each other and clawed each other&#x27;s fur, and the parrots were given free range in the hotels where the diva was staying, and were frequently destructive of the furnishings. De Murska accepted the consequent expenses happily.

==Assessments==
Music critics, aristocratic opera patrons and ordinary listeners alike called her &quot;The Croatian Nightingale&quot; following her acclaimed appearances in Vienna and London.
As a singer she was wild and uninhibited, to the frustration of the conductor, as she was apt to depart from the score in fantastic improvisations, and he would be obliged to hold back the orchestra&#x27;s crescendo until she was ready. This power was, of course, exactly what endeared her to the audience.

==Death==
Ema Pukšec (aka Ilma de Murska) died in Munich on January 14, 1889, aged 54.

<text>A module (Latin &quot;modulus&quot;, a measure) is a term that was in use among Roman architects, corresponding to the semidiameter of the column at its base. The term was first set forth by Vitruvius (book iv.3), and was employed by architects in the Italian Renaissance to determine the relative proportions of the various parts of the Classical orders. The module was divided by the 16th century theorists into thirty parts, called minutes, allowing for much greater precision than was thought necessary by Vitruvius, whose subdivision was usually six parts.

When illustrating Palladio, the British architect Isaac Ware (&quot;The Four Books of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s Architecture&quot;, London 1738; &quot;illustration, right&quot;) laid out the Doric order as an exercise in modular construction. The module he selected was a full column diameter taken at the base. He set his columns, 15 modules tall, at an intercolumniation of 5½ modules. His architrave and frieze, without the cornice, are equal to one module.

The tendency in Beaux-Arts architectural training was similarly to adopt the whole columnar diameter as the module when determining the height of the column or entablature or any of their subdivisions.

Thus module can be extended to mean more generally a unitary part that gives the measuring unit for the whole. In education, for example, lessons may be divided into modules.

<doc id="872411" wikidata="Q3568925" url="?curid=872411" title="William S. Harney">
<text>William Selby Harney (August 22, 1800 – May 9, 1889), otherwise known among the Lakota as &quot;Woman Killer&quot; and &quot;Mad Bear,&quot; was an American cavalry officer in the US Army, who became known during the Indian Wars and the Mexican–American War for his brutality and ruthlessness. One of five general officers (including Winfield Scott, David Twiggs, John Wool, and Joseph E. Johnston) in the US Army at the beginning of the American Civil War, he was removed from overseeing the Department of the West because of his Southern sympathies early in the war, although he kept Missouri from joining the Confederacy. Under President Andrew Johnson, he served on the Indian Peace Commission, negotiating in several treaties before spending his retirement partly in Missouri and partly trading reminiscences with Jefferson Davis and Ulysses S. Grant in Mississippi, eventually moving to Florida afterwards, where he spent the last few years of his life.

==Early life==
William S. Harney was born on August 27, 1800, in Haysborough (Haysboro), a community on the Cumberland River (then a few miles above Nashville, Tennessee, now incorporated in the city), Harney attended a local private academy. His father Thomas Harney had been an army officer.

==Early military career==
In 1817, Harney&#x27;s brother, Dr. Benjamin F. Harney, an Army surgeon in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, asked Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812 and the current commander of the Army of the South, to write a letter to the Secretary of the Navy to ask for Harney&#x27;s acceptance into the Navy, which occurred July 23, 1817. Harney visited his brother and met high-ranking military officers. He so impressed them that they arranged a commission for him as a U.S. Navy second lieutenant, which President James Monroe signed. However, Harney chose to serve under Jackson in the army. His first military assignment under Jackson was in 1818, as a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Infantry. He helped to force the pirate Jean Lafitte to move his operations from the Louisiana Territory to the Spanish Main.

Harney began his many years of interactions with Native Americans on the Great Plains in 1825, when he accompanied Colonel Henry Atkinson and Benjamin O&#x27;Fallon on an expedition to sign treaties with the Upper Missouri tribes. In 1832, Harney fought in the Black Hawk War against the Sauk and Fox tribes, serving as General Zachary Taylor&#x27;s assistant inspector. There he met, fought, and befriended Jefferson Davis, Taylor&#x27;s son-in-law and a fellow army officer.

===Murder of Hannah===
In June 1834, while he was a major in the Paymaster Corps, Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, Missouri, Harney was charged with beating an enslaved woman, Hannah, to death. In a fit of anger he hit her with a piece of rawhide, and then fled to avoid arrest, while seeking a transfer to another state. The coroner ruled Hannah died as a result of Harney&#x27;s violent actions, and he was indicted for murder by a grand jury in July. The trial was moved to Union, Missouri, and scheduled for the spring of 1835. Overseen by a judge with &quot;a reputation in which Harney could take comfort&quot; (according to biographer George Rollie Adams), fifteen witnesses spoke in court, their testimony going unrecorded, and Harney, &quot;although clearly responsible for Hannah&#x27;s death,&quot; was acquitted.

===Second Seminole War===
During the Second Seminole War (1835–1842), Harney gained a reputation as an Indian fighter for daring and ruthless raids. Harney and troops under his command often fought the Seminole war leader and mystic Sam Jones, also known as Abiaka. Harney first fought against Abiaka in January 1838 at the Second Battle of the Loxahatchee. In July 1839, Abiaka&#x27;s warriors attacked Harney and his soldiers at the Battle of the Caloosahatchee.

===Mexican–American War===
During the Mexican–American War, Harney was appointed colonel and commanded the 2nd Dragoons. They were attached to John E. Wool&#x27;s command during the Chihuahua Expedition and the Battle of Buena Vista. Harney joined Winfield Scott&#x27;s army as senior cavalry officer at the siege of Veracruz. However, Harney&#x27;s headstrong and insubordinate temperament caused losses and embarrassment. So when Harney refused to leave Monterrey, despite orders to do so, he was replaced by Major Edwin V. Sumner, and Brevet Major General William J. Worth placed Harney under court-martial, and Harney was ultimately convicted. However, President James K. Polk overrode Scott&#x27;s judgment to remove Harney from command and concluded that Harney&#x27;s only fault was being in the Democratic Party. The incident damaged the relationship between the general and Commander-in-Chief.

Placed in temporary command of the 1st Brigade in David Twiggs&#x27;s division, Harney fought with distinction at the Battle of Cerro Gordo and received a promotion to brevet brigadier general. He returned to cavalry command during the Battle of Contreras, the Battle of Churubusco, and the Battles for Mexico City. However, he was accused of mistreatment of captured prisoners from the St. Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, which included US Army deserters and escaped slaves. Harney became an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847, which was composed of American officers who had served in Mexico.

===First Sioux War===
On May 14, 1849, on the death of Brevet Major General William J. Worth, Harney assumed command of Military Department Number Five, which comprised almost all of the settled portion of Texas. He was assigned to control Indian raids, which led to the First Sioux War (discussed in part below), although Harney actually commanded Military Department No. 5 for only three short periods, having been replaced by Colonel George N. Brooke on July 7, 1849; after Brooke&#x27;s death from March 9 until September 15, 1851, when he was replaced by Colonel Persifor N. Smith, and then from December 3, 1852, until he was again relieved by Smith on May 11, 1853.

Recalled from leave after he had attempted to visit his family in Paris in 1854, Harney led a punitive expedition against the Sioux after they killed a small US Army detachment in Nebraska Territory, an event called the Grattan massacre. He led attacks against the Brulé Lakota, who were involved in conflicts with immigrant travelers on the Oregon Trail. In the Battle of Ash Hollow, on September 2 and 3, 1855, Harney&#x27;s troops routed Little Thunder&#x27;s village at Blue Water Creek (now known as Ash Hollow), in western Nebraska, killing about half of the 250 band members. Among the victims were women and children who had hidden in a cave, into which cannons were fired under the pretense that they were warriors. Harney earned a Lakota name translated as &quot;Mad Bear&quot; because after the attack, he marched across the Badlands to Fort Pierre, the largest trading post in Dakota Territory, and challenged the Lakotas to a winter fight. The success of the campaign encouraged Harney to suggest that mobile units might replace permanent army posts.

Harney briefly commanded troops during the Utah War and was again recalled and placed in command of troops sent to deal with the guerrilla warfare of Bleeding Kansas.

Next, he was assigned command of the Department of Oregon. Harney sent Captain George E. Pickett and troops to San Juan Island, precipitating the Pig War with British forces. The Army recalled Harney to St. Louis after the altercations with the British.

Promoted to brigadier general on June 14, 1858, Harney was, at 57, the youngest of the four general officers in the regular army at the time, (alongside the War of 1812 veterans Winfield Scott, John Wool, and David Twiggs, the next-youngest, at 70, because of the lack of a fixed retirement age).

==American Civil War==
As the American Civil War began, Harney was still in command of the Army&#x27;s Department of the West based at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, and his wife&#x27;s family was prominent in the area. General Twiggs accepted a Confederate commission to head the Department of Louisiana and was accordingly dismissed from the US Army and replaced by Edwin V. Sumner. Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson was pro-secession, but the majority of Missourians favored the Union. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, President Abraham Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion. Jackson refused and began plotting with Confederate authorities to bring about Missouri&#x27;s secession by a military coup.

On May 10, 1861, Captain Nathaniel Lyon, commander of the St. Louis Arsenal, led a force of unofficial Unionist &quot;Home Guards&quot; to capture a force of state militia that were poised to seize the Arsenal by acting without any authorization from Harney, his superior. The Camp Jackson Affair resulted in a bloody riot in St. Louis, which horrified Harney.

The state legislature responded by reorganizing the militia as the Missouri State Guard and authorizing it to resist an invasion by federal troops. Harney tried to calm the situation and agreed to the Price–Harney Truce with Guard Commander Sterling Price, who was married to Harney&#x27;s wife&#x27;s niece. They agreed that the State Guard would control most of Missouri while federal troops stayed near St. Louis. The deal also involved Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson, who favored secession but swore allegiance to the Union.

That was not acceptable to Unionist leaders in Missouri, including the Republican leader Francis Preston Blair Jr., since Price did nothing to prevent the organization of pro-Confederate forces or to protect Unionists in his territory. Worsening matters was Harney&#x27;s Tennessee heritage, which made his loyalty to the Union suspect. Blair reported all to the Lincoln administration in Washington, DC, and was authorized to replace Harney with Lyon, which Blair did on 30 May.

Recalled to Washington to discuss the situation, Harney was captured by Confederates at Harper&#x27;s Ferry on April 25, 1861. He was offered a command by Confederate General Robert E. Lee but turned down the offer. However, because he was a Tennessean, his captors released him and allowed him to continue on to Washington.

Harney remained in Washington and served in various administrative positions. When it became clear that he would not receive another field command, he retired in 1863 and lived in St. Louis. In recognition of his long and distinguished career, he was awarded and breveted to major general in 1865.

==Later years==
President Andrew Johnson appointed Harney to the Indian Peace Commission and so he returned to the Great Plains in 1865 and 1867 to negotiate treaties. In part because Harney urged the US Congress to honor past treaties. He helped secure the Little Arkansas Treaty with the Comanche and Kiowa in 1865, the Medicine Lodge Treaty in 1867 and the Fort Laramie Treaty with the Brule Sioux in 1868. In 1868, Harney established three Sioux agencies on the Missouri River, which he did at Whetstone Creek, Cheyenne River, and Grand River.

Harney then retired to Pass Christian, Mississippi, on the Gulf Coast and often reminisced with his old friend Jefferson Davis about their old service at Fort Crawford, including their near duel; they forgot their opposite service during the American Civil War. After Davis&#x27;s death, Harney moved to the Orlando, Florida area, where he died.

==Personal life==
In 1833, in St. Louis, he married Mary Mullanphy, daughter of John Mullanphy, an Irish immigrant who became a wealthy merchant in Baltimore and St. Louis&#x27; first millionaire. Harney converted to Catholicism, and they had three children including John Mullanphy Harney (1847–1905). However, Harney only saw his wife twice after 1850, and she would relocate to France with their children in 1853, where she died in 1860. Her children would return to St. Louis, and their granddaughter Marie Antoinette Harney Beauregard (1868–1940) would marry the son of Confederate general Pierre Beauregard. In 1884, Harney married Mary St. Cyr (1826–1907).

==Death ==
Harney died at his home near Orlando, Florida, in 1889, just months after Harney County, Oregon was named for him. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, as would be his widow in 1907. His will, witnessed by Ulysses S. Grant and filed in St. Louis, gave his son &quot;John Hearney&quot; and daughter &quot;Eliza Hearney&quot; $5 each, and the rest of his property, wherever located, to his widow. Harney is an intriguing figure representing perhaps an individualist standing apart, in an age of rough dichotomies. The one-time renowned &quot;Indian Fighter&quot; had also served on an Indian Peace Commission due to his familiarity with native people. However, the appointment was made not due to his advocacy of Indians, but rather because he had been one of the few men to successfully wage war against them and was someone who could gain their attention.

Harney was known among the Sioux as &quot;Woman Killer&quot; due to his actions (known as the &quot;Harney Massacre&quot;) at an Indian village in 1855 at Blue Water Creek, south of the Black Hills: &quot;While engaged in a delaying parley with Chief Little Thunder&quot; Harney&#x27;s troops &quot;circled undetected&quot; toward the village, &quot;where the infantry opened fire and forced the Indians toward mounted soldiers, who inflicted terrible casualties. Initial reports stated 86 Indians were killed and 70 women and children were captured; however, the totals were later determined to be higher as additional casualties were found in the following days. The Indians tipis were looted and burned by Harney’s troops.

<text>In quantum mechanics, superselection extends the concept of selection rules.

Superselection rules are postulated rules forbidding the preparation of quantum states that exhibit coherence between eigenstates of certain observables.
It was originally introduced by Gian Carlo Wick, Arthur Wightman, and Eugene Wigner to impose additional restrictions to quantum theory beyond those of selection rules.

Mathematically speaking, two quantum states formula_1 and formula_2 are separated by a selection rule if formula_3 for the given Hamiltonian formula_4, while they are separated by a superselection rule if formula_5 for &quot;all &quot;physical observables formula_6. Because no observable connects formula_7 and formula_8 they cannot be put into a quantum superposition formula_9, and/or a quantum superposition cannot be distinguished from a classical mixture of the two states. It also implies that there is a classically conserved quantity that differs between the two states.

A superselection sector is a concept used in quantum mechanics when a representation of a *-algebra is decomposed into irreducible components. It formalizes the idea that not all self-adjoint operators are observables because the relative phase of a superposition of nonzero states from different irreducible components is not observable (the expectation values of the observables can&#x27;t distinguish between them).

==Formulation==
Suppose &quot;A&quot; is a unital *-algebra and &quot;O&quot; is a unital *-subalgebra whose self-adjoint elements correspond to observables. A unitary representation of &quot;O&quot; may be decomposed as the direct sum of irreducible unitary representations of &quot;O&quot;. Each isotypic component in this decomposition is called a &quot;superselection sector&quot;. Observables preserve the superselection sectors.

==Relationship to symmetry==
Symmetries often give rise to superselection sectors (although this is not the only way they occur). Suppose a group &quot;G&quot; acts upon &quot;A&quot;, and that H is a unitary representation of both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G&quot; which is equivariant in the sense that for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;ψ&quot; in H,
:formula_10

Suppose that &quot;O&quot; is an invariant subalgebra of &quot;A&quot; under &quot;G&quot; (all observables are invariant under &quot;G&quot;, but not every self-adjoint operator invariant under &quot;G&quot; is necessarily an observable). H decomposes into superselection sectors, each of which is the tensor product of an irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot; with a representation of &quot;O&quot;.

This can be generalized by assuming that H is only a representation of an extension or cover &quot;K&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. (For instance &quot;G&quot; could be the Lorentz group, and &quot;K&quot; the corresponding spin double cover.) Alternatively, one can replace &quot;G&quot; by a Lie algebra, Lie superalgebra or a Hopf algebra.

==Examples==
Consider a quantum mechanical particle confined to a closed loop (i.e., a periodic line of period &quot;L&quot;). The superselection sectors are labeled by an angle θ between 0 and 2π. All the wave functions within a single superselection sector satisfy
:formula_11

==Superselection sectors==
A large physical system with infinitely many degrees of freedom does not always visit every possible state, even if it has enough energy. If a magnet is magnetized in a certain direction, each spin will fluctuate at any temperature, but the net magnetization will never change. The reason is that it is infinitely improbable that all the infinitely many spins at each different position will all fluctuate together in the same way.

A big system often has superselection sectors. In a solid, different rotations and translations which are not lattice symmetries define superselection sectors. In general, a superselection rule is a quantity that can never change through local fluctuations. Aside from order parameters like the magnetization of a magnet, there are also topological quantities, like the winding number. If a string is wound around a circular wire, the total number of times it winds around never changes under local fluctuations. This is an ordinary conservation law. If the wire is an infinite line, under conditions that the vacuum does not have winding number fluctuations which are coherent throughout the system, the conservation law is a superselection rule --- the probability that the winding will unwind is zero.

There are quantum fluctuations, superpositions arising from different configurations of a phase-type path integral, and statistical fluctuations from a Boltzmann type path integral. Both of these path integrals have the property that large changes in an effectively infinite system require an improbable conspiracy between the fluctuations. So there are both statistical mechanical and quantum mechanical superselection rules.

In a theory where the vacuum is invariant under a symmetry, the conserved charge leads to superselection sectors in the case that the charge is conserved. Electric charge is conserved in our universe, so it seems at first like a trivial example. But when a superconductor fills space, or equivalently in a Higgs phase, electric charge is still globally conserved but no longer defines the superselection sectors. The sloshing of the superconductor can bring charges into any volume at very little cost. In this case, the superselection sectors of the vacuum are labeled by the direction of the Higgs field. Since different Higgs directions are related by an exact symmetry, they are all exactly equivalent. This suggests a deep relationship between symmetry breaking directions and conserved charges.

===Discrete symmetry===
In the 2D Ising model, at low temperatures, there are two distinct pure states, one with the average spin pointing up and the other with the average spin pointing down. This is the ordered phase. At high temperatures, there is only one pure state with an average spin of zero. This is the disordered phase. At the phase transition between the two, the symmetry between spin up and spin down is broken.

Below the phase transition temperature, an infinite ising model can be in either the mostly-plus or the mostly-minus configuration. If it starts in the mostly-plus phase, it will never reach the mostly-minus, even though flipping all the spins will give the same energy. By changing the temperature, the system acquired a new superselection rule--- the average spin. There are two superselection sectors--- mostly minus and mostly plus.

There are also other superselection sectors; for instance, states where the left half of the plane is mostly plus and the right half of the plane is mostly minus.

When a new superselection rule appears, the system has spontaneously ordered. Above the critical temperature, the ising model is disordered. It could visit every state in principle. Below the transition, the system chooses one of two possibilities at random and never changes its mind.

For any finite system, the superselection is imperfect. An Ising model on a finite lattice will eventually fluctuate from the mostly plus to the mostly minus at any nonzero temperature, but it takes a very long time. The amount of time is exponentially small in the size of the system measured in correlation lengths, so for all practical purposes the flip never happens even in systems only a few times larger than the correlation length.

===Continuous symmetries===
If a statistical or quantum field has three real valued scalar fields formula_12, and the energy or action only depends on combinations which are symmetric under rotations of these components into each other, the contributions with the lowest dimension are (summation convention):

:formula_13

and define the action in a quantum field context or free energy in the statistical context. There are two phases. When t is large, the potential tends to move the average formula_14 to zero. For t large and negative, the quadratic potential pushes formula_14 out, but the quartic potential prevents it from becoming infinite. If this is done in a quantum path integral, this is a quantum phase transition, in a classical partition function, a classical phase transition.

So as t moves toward more negative values in either context, the field has to choose some direction to point. Once it does this, it cannot change its mind. The system has &quot;ordered&quot;. In the ordered phase, there is still a little bit of symmetry--- rotations around the axis of the breaking. The field can point in any direction labelled by all the points on a unit sphere in formula_14 space, which is the coset space of the unbroken SO(2) subgroup in the full symmetry group SO(3).

In the disordered phase, the superselection sectors are described by the representation of SO(3) under which a given configuration transforms globally. Because the SO(3) is unbroken, different representations will not mix with each other. No local fluctuation will ever bring in nontrivial SO(3) configurations from infinity. A local configuration is entirely defined by its representation.

There is a mass gap, or a correlation length, which separates configurations with a nontrivial SO(3) transformations from the rotationally invariant vacuum. This is true until the critical point in t where the mass gap disappears and the correlation length is infinite. The vanishing gap is a sign that the fluctuations in the SO(3) field are about to condense.

In the ordered region, there are field configurations which can carry topological charge. These are labeled by elements of the second homotopy group formula_17. Each of these describe a different field configuration which at large distances from the origin is a winding configuration. Although each such isolated configuration has infinite energy, it labels superselection sectors where the difference in energy between two states is finite. In addition, pairs of winding configurations with opposite topological charge can be produced copiously as the transition is approached from below.

When the winding number is zero, so that the field everywhere points in the same direction, there is an additional infinity of superselection sectors, each labelled by a different value of the unbroken SO(2) charge.

In the ordered state, there is a mass gap for the superselection sectors labeled by a nonzero integer, because the topological solitons are massive, even infinitely massive. But there is no mass gap for all the superselection sectors labeled by zero because there are massless Goldstone bosons describing fluctuations in the direction of the condensate.

If the field values are identified under a Z2 reflection (corresponding to flipping the sign of all the formula_14 fields), the superselection sectors are labelled by a nonnegative integer (the absolute value of the topological charge).

O(3) charges only make sense in the disordered phase and not at all in the ordered phase. This is because when the symmetry is broken there is a condensate which is charged, which is not invariant under the symmetry group. Conversely, the topological charge only makes sense in the ordered phase and not at all in the disordered phase, because in some hand-waving way there is a &quot;topological condensate&quot; in the disordered phase which randomizes the field from point to point. The randomizing can be thought of as crossing many condensed topological winding boundaries.

The very question of what charges are meaningful depends very much on the phase. Approaching the phase transition from the disordered side, the mass of the charges particles approaches zero. Approaching it from the ordered side, the mass gap associated with fluctuations of the topological solitons approaches zero.

==Examples in particle physics==
; Higgs mechanism

In the standard model of particle physics, in the electroweak sector,
the low energy model is SU(2) and U(1) broken to U(1) by a Higgs doublet. The
only superselection rule determining the configuration is the total electric charge.
If there are monopoles, then the monopole charge must be included.

If the Higgs t parameter is varied so that it does not acquire a vacuum expectation
value, the universe is now symmetric under an unbroken SU(2) and U(1) gauge group. If
the SU(2) has infinitesimally weak couplings, so that it only confines at enormous
distances, then the representation of the SU(2) group and the U(1) charge both are
superselection rules. But if the SU(2) has a nonzero coupling then the superselection
sectors are separated by infinite mass because the mass of any state in a nontrivial representation is infinite.

By changing the temperature, the Higgs fluctuations can zero out the expectation value at
a finite temperature. Above this temperature, the SU(2) and U(1) quantum numbers describe
the superselection sectors. Below the phase transition, only electric charge defines the superselection sector.

;Chiral quark condensate

Consider the global flavour symmetry of QCD in the chiral limit where the masses of the quarks are zero. This is not exactly the universe in which we live, where the up and down quarks have a tiny but nonzero mass, but it is a very good approximation, to the extent that isospin is conserved.

Below a certain temperature which is the symmetry restoration temperature, the phase is ordered.
The chiral condensate forms, and pions of small mass are produced. The SU(Nf) charges, Isospin and Hypercharge and SU(3), make sense. Above the QCD temperature lies a disordered phase where SU(Nf)×SU(Nf) and color SU(3) charges make sense.

It is an open question whether the deconfinement temperature of QCD is also the temperature at which the chiral condensate melts.

<text>The scientific school of Quantum electrochemistry began to form in the 1960s under Revaz Dogonadze. Generally speaking, the field comprises the notions arising in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and electrochemistry; and so is studied by a very large array of different professional researchers. The fields they reside in include, chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering, chemistry and physics.

More specifically, quantum electrochemistry is the application of quantum mechanical tools such as density functional theory to the study of electrochemical processes, including electron transfer at electrodes. It also includes Marcus theory and quantum rate theory, the latter being a method of describing electrochemistry using first principle quantum mechanics and concepts of conductance quantum and quantum capacitance.

== History and contributors ==
The first development of &quot;quantum electrochemistry&quot; is somewhat difficult to pin down. This is not very surprising, since the development of quantum mechanics to chemistry can be summarized as the application of quantum wave theory models to atoms and molecules. This being the case, electrochemistry, which is particularly concerned with the electronic states of some particular system, is already, by its nature, tied into the quantum mechanical model of the electron in quantum chemistry. There were proponents of quantum electrochemistry, who applied quantum mechanics to electrochemistry with unusual zeal, clarity, and precision. Among them were Revaz Dogonadze and his co-workers. They developed one of the early quantum mechanical models for proton transfer reactions in chemical systems. Dogonadze is a particularly celebrated promoter of quantum electrochemistry and is also credited with forming an international summer school of quantum electrochemistry centered in Yugoslavia. He was the main author of the &quot;Quantum-Mechanical Theory of Kinetics of the Elementary Act of Chemical, Electrochemical and Biochemical Processes in Polar Liquids&quot;. Another important contributor is Rudolph A. Marcus, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1992 for his &quot;Theory of Electron Transfer Reactions in Chemical Systems&quot;. Recently, Marcus theory has been shown to be part of a more general concept associated with the quantum rate theory, a theory that predicts the rate of electron transfer (electrochemistry being a particular case) based on the uses of conductance quantum and quantum capacitance concepts.

<doc id="872417" wikidata="Q5513898" url="?curid=872417" title="General Motors Sigma platform">
<text>The General Motors Sigma platform is a mid-size automobile platform used by General Motors from the 2003 to 2015 model years. Exclusive to the Cadillac division, Sigma was the successor to the Opel-designed V platform. Initially developed for executive cars, the architecture was expanded for larger model lines, sports sedans, and multiple body styles. 

Two generations of the Sigma platform were developed by GM for worldwide markets. The architecture was discontinued for the 2016 in favor of the GM Alpha platform, itself utilized nearly exclusively by Cadillac. 

== Sigma I ==
The first Cadillac-exclusive platform since the D-body chassis, Sigma debuted in early 2002 for the 2003 model year underpinning the Cadillac CTS, replacing the Cadillac Catera. Slightly larger than its V-body predecessor, the rear-wheel drive Sigma architecture was developed to accommodate all-wheel drive and extended-wheelbase variants. For 2004, the Cadillac STS was introduced on the Sigma platform, replacing the Cadillac Seville. Sharing its wheelbase with the STS, the Cadillac SRX was introduced for 2005 as the second Cadillac SUV, slotted below the Escalade in size. 

The Sigma platform uses four-wheel independent suspension with front control arms and a rear multi-link configuration. Initially powered by variants of the General Motors 54° V6 engine family, the platform introduced additional engines, including the High Feature V6 and Northstar V8. Exclusive to the high-performance CTS-V, the Sigma platform was developed to accommodate the 5.7L LS6 and 6.0L LS2 V8 engines of the Chevrolet Corvette. Outside of the CTS (which offered a standard 5-speed manual and a 6-speed manual for the CTS-V), all Sigma vehicles utilized GM 5-speed 5L40/5L50 automatic transmissions. 

The Sigma architecture marked several firsts, as the CTS was the first Cadillac since the 1986 Cadillac Cimarron to be offered with a manual transmission. The 2004 STS became the first rear-wheel drive Cadillac sedan to offer the Northstar engine (originally developed for front-wheel drive applications). The China-market Cadillac SLS became the first non-limousine Cadillac sedan line introduced as a extended-wheelbase variant. 

Vehicles based on this platform:
* 2003–2007 Cadillac CTS 
* 2004–2009 Cadillac SRX 
* 2005–2011 Cadillac STS
* 2007–2013 Cadillac SLS (China)

==Sigma II==
GM debuted Sigma II with the 2008 Cadillac CTS. While sharing the previous 113.4-inch wheelbase, the platform was longer and wider than the previous generation. Remaining exclusive to the Cadillac division, the design adopted a greater degree of parts sharing with the Australian-designed Zeta platform. The High Feature engines were carried over to Sigma II, with the CTS-V receiving a supercharged LSA V8 (a variant of the Corvette ZR1 engine). 

Sigma II became exclusive to the CTS, as the SRX was downsized for 2010, adopting the Theta Premium architecture and the STS was retired after 2011 (the SLS, 2013) with no direct successor. 

For 2011, coupé and station wagon variants were introduced on the Sigma II platform (marking the first Cadillac coupe with a rear seat since the 2002 Eldorado)

Applications:
* 2008–2013 Cadillac CTS 
* 2009–2015 Cadillac CTS-V

<doc id="872422" wikidata="Q5513915" url="?curid=872422" title="General Motors Zeta platform">
<text>Zeta was the original name for General Motors&#x27; full-size rear-wheel drive automobile platform developed by GM&#x27;s Australian subsidiary company Holden and was at one stage referred to as the &quot;GM Global RWD Architecture&quot;. The GM Zeta platform replaced the V-body, and debuted with 2006 Holden Commodore (VE) sedan and Holden (VE) Ute. This platform was considered as the replacement for the North American W, H, and K platforms until plans were cancelled due to fuel-economy considerations and GM&#x27;s financial situation. Although the future of the Zeta program was in doubt at that time, in May 2009, Holden began the development of an improved second version of the platform that went on to form the basis of the 2013 Commodore (VF) and Chevrolet SS.

The 2010-15 fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro was the only Zeta platform model produced in North America. All other Zeta platform vehicles have been manufactured in Australia by Holden. In 2016, the Chevrolet Camaro (sixth generation) debuted on the GM Alpha platform.

Australian manufactured models include the long-wheelbase Holden WM Statesman/Caprice sedan and the high performance range produced by Holden Special Vehicles. On export markets, Holden-based models included the:
* short-wheelbase Commodore (VE)-based Pontiac G8 and the Commodore (VF)-based Chevrolet SS (for North America)
* full HSV range (for New Zealand and Singapore), the HSV-based Vauxhall VXR8 (for the United Kingdom) and Chevrolet Specialised Vehicles (CSV) E-series (for the Middle East)
* the long-wheelbase Chevrolet Caprice PPV and the Buick Park Avenue (the latter exported to China as a Complete knock down (CKD) kit).

In December 2013, Holden announced that it would cease its local production by 2017 and, with it, the production of the GM Zeta platform. Production ended in October 2017.

==Development==
Development was started in late 1999 by Holden to replace the aging V-body platform underpinning the third generation Commodore that debuted in 1997, after Opel announced that its Omega (on which the Commodore was based) would be discontinued. Principal development on the VE Commodore was completed by July 2004 at a cost approaching A$1 billion and the first testing mules underwent trials later that year. Unlike previous Holden platforms, the platform was designed around the LWB Caprice and Statesman initially and then shortened to create the Commodore. General Motors global corporate headquarters was impressed by the VE design and began studies on using the underlying architecture (internally christened Zeta by GM engineers) for a range of future products on a global scale. After the cancellation of the plan due to the fuel-economy considerations and GM&#x27;s financial situation, the idea of Zeta as a global rear drive platform was revived with plans for the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro of 2010.

==Features==
The Zeta architecture was designed for great flexibility and could accommodate a wide variety of automotive features such as wheelbase length, ride height, windshield rake and roof line. Zeta&#x27;s suspension system was all wheel independent and utilizes a MacPherson strut coupled with a dual ball joint lower A-arm for the front and a four link independent setup for the rear wheels. The engine was mounted slightly behind the front axle giving improved weight distribution.

==Further development==
In May 2009, Holden began the re-engineering of the Zeta platform to create a lighter, stronger, better handling and more fuel efficient version. The improved second version of the platform formed the basis of the 2013 Commodore (VF), which also spawned the 2013 Chevrolet SS that GM announced in May 2012 for the US market. This Chevrolet made its debut at the 2013 Daytona Shootout. The Holden VF Commodore, on which the Chevrolet SS is based, went on sale the same day in Australia.

==End of production==
In December 2013, Holden announced the planned termination of its manufacturing operations at the Elizabeth plant in South Australia by the end of 2017 and, with it, that of the Zeta platform. Sigma-based vehicles that shared design engineering with Zeta transitioned to the Alpha platform, which had used Zeta as its design inspiration. The Chevrolet Camaro, the only GM Zeta based car manufactured outside of Australia, transitioned from the Zeta platform to the Alpha platform in November 2015, with the launch of the 2016 sixth generation model.

==Vehicles==
The vehicles that have used the Zeta platform include:
* 2006-2013 Holden VE Commodore / 2007-2012 Bitter Vero Sport / 2006-2013 HSV E Series / 2007-2013 Vauxhall VXR8 and CSV equivalents / 2007-2011 Chevrolet Lumina / 2008-2009 Pontiac G8 / 2006 (2010) Chevrolet Omega
* 2006-2013 Holden WM Statesman/Caprice 2014–2017 Holden WN Caprice/2007-2012 Bitter Vero/ 2007-2017 Chevrolet Caprice / 2008-2010 Daewoo Veritas / 2007-2012 Buick Park Avenue / 2006-2013 HSV E-Series Grange/ 2014–2017 HSV F-Series Grange
* 2007–2017 Holden Ute
* 2008 Holden Coupe 60 concept car
* 2010–2015 Chevrolet Camaro
* 2011–2017 Chevrolet Caprice PPV police vehicle
* 2013–2017 Holden VF Commodore / Chevrolet SS / HSV F Series.

<doc id="872424" wikidata="Q1791388" url="?curid=872424" title="Sobriety">
<text>Sobriety is the condition of not having any effects from alcohol and other drugs. Sobriety is also considered to be the natural state of a human being at birth. A person in a state of sobriety is considered sober. Organizations of the temperance movement have encouraged sobriety as being normative in society. 

In a treatment setting, sobriety is the achieved goal of independence from consuming alcohol. As such, sustained abstinence is a prerequisite for sobriety. Early in abstinence, residual effects of alcohol consumption can preclude sobriety. These effects are labeled &quot;PAWS&quot;, or &quot;post-acute-withdrawal syndrome&quot;. Someone who abstains, but has a latent desire to resume use, may be termed a &quot;dry drunk&quot; and not considered truly sober. An abstainer may be subconsciously motivated to resume alcohol consumption, but for a variety of reasons, abstains (e.g. a medical or legal concern precluding use). 

Sobriety has more specific meanings within specific contexts, such as the culture of many substance use recovery programs, law enforcement, and some schools of psychology. In some cases, sobriety implies the achievement of &quot;life balance&quot;, or reflects a broader aspiration to a simpler and less material lifestyle.

==Recovery support programs==
Sobriety may refer to being clear of immediate or residual effects of any mind-altering substances. Colloquially, it may refer to a specific substance that is the concern of a particular recovery support program (e.g. alcohol, marijuana, opiates, or tobacco). &quot;Clean and sober&quot; is a commonly used phrase, which refers to someone having an extended period without alcohol or other drugs in their body.

Recovery can start in many different ways for all people. One may go to rehab, a detox center or engage a sober companion to start. The next recovery support program may be slightly more difficult to find. Sober living can be confusing using any generic search engine. Recovery resources exist for many different companies, mainly across the United States. 

Alcoholics can also use books, podcasts and online resources to help their own recovery.

==Temperance organizations==

Organizations of the temperance movement have encouraged sobriety as being normative in society. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union disseminates literature on the living a sober lifestyle, while fraternal organisations such as the Independent Order of Rechabites and International Organisation of Good Templars provide a space for teetotalers to socialize.

==Law enforcement==
Field sobriety tests and breathalyzer testing are two ways law enforcement officers often test for sobriety in a suspected high or drunk driver. In the US, these &quot;standardized field sobriety tests&quot; are at the officer&#x27;s discretion. They can also administer other tests including blood and urine tests. In other countries (for example The Netherlands), only breathalizer and blood testing is used. Standardized tests that can be performed in the US include:
* One-leg stand test
* Walk and turn test
* HGN (eye) test (horizontal gaze nystagmus test)
Non-standardized tests include:
* Romberg&#x27;s test
* Finger-to-nose test
* Finger-count test
* Hand pat test
* Alphabet recitation test 
* Counting numbers backwards 
Since these tests rely on cooperation of the subject, the final result often depends on the presiding officer&#x27;s interpretation. There are many factors that can lead to inaccuracies in sobriety testing including orthopedic or neurologic conditions, and fatigue.

==The sober curious movement==
Sober curious is a cultural movement and lifestyle of practicing none or limited alcohol consumption which started spreading in the late 2010s, in particular among people from the millennial generation. Sober curiosity is often defined as having the option to question or change one&#x27;s drinking habits, for mental or physical health reasons. It may be practised in many ways, ranging from complete abstinence to thinking more about when and how much one actually wants to drink.

<doc id="872426" wikidata="Q5513846" url="?curid=872426" title="General Motors Delta platform">
<text>Delta was a General Motors compact front-wheel drive automobile and crossover SUV platform, originally developed by Opel Group. Delta was a successor to the Opel T platform; it also replaced J platform and the Z platform used by the Saturn S-Series. The platform debuted in the 2003 Saturn Ion. Vehicles of this platform generally carry the letter &quot;A&quot; in the fourth character of their VINs.

Delta uses an independent suspension in front and Twist beam type in the rear. The Ecotec engine is widely used, as are a 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual transmission.

== Delta ==

=== Applications ===
Former vehicles based on this platform:
* 2003–2007 Saturn Ion
* 2005–2010 Chevrolet Cobalt
* 2005–2009 Pontiac G5/G4/Pursuit
* 2006–2011 Chevrolet HHR

== Delta II ==
Delta II was General Motors&#x27; global compact car platform, developed by Opel in Germany. It was the successor to the GM Delta platform. Internally it is simply known as a new &quot;Global Compact Vehicle Architecture or GCV&quot;.

The platform features a torsion beam (marketed as &quot;compound crank&quot;) rear suspension with optional Watt&#x27;s link which improves vehicle handling; such configuration is used with the Opel Astra, Buick Verano, Cadillac ELR, Opel Cascada and higher trim-levels of the American-market Chevrolet Cruze.

This suspension is usually described as semi-independent, meaning that the two wheels can move relative to each other, but their motion is still somewhat inter-linked, to a greater extent than in a true independent rear suspension (IRS). This can mildly compromise the handling and ride quality of the vehicle. For this reason, some manufacturers have changed to different linkage designs. As an example, Volkswagen dropped the torsion beam in favour of a true IRS for the Volkswagen Golf Mk5, possibly in response to the Ford Focus&#x27; Control Blade rear suspension.

As noted, certain GM brands and models have continued to use the suspension setup, known variously as twist beam, torsion beam or compound crank suspension. This is at a cost saving of €100 per car compared to multi-link rear suspension. The version used on the 2009-on Opel Astra and the 2011-2016 Buick Verano uses a Watts linkage at a cost of €20 to address the drawbacks and provide a competitive and cost effective rear suspension. The Renault Mégane and Citroen C4 also have stayed with the twist beam. The twist beam has been shown to suffer less from bush wear, than fully independent multi-link suspension, thus resulting in a virtually maintenance free rear suspension.

GM chose this compact vehicle architecture for its first Voltec application, the Chevrolet Volt. Production began in November 2010 with the first Chevrolet Volts delivered to retails customers in December 2010.

=== Applications ===
Production vehicles based on Delta II platform:
* 2008–2016 Chevrolet Cruze, Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, Holden Cruze
* 2009–2015 Opel Astra J, Buick Excelle XT
* 2010–2015 Chevrolet Volt
* 2010–2018 Chevrolet Orlando
* 2011–2016 Buick Verano
* 2011–2015 Opel Ampera
* 2011–2019 Opel Zafira Tourer C
* 2013–2016 Cadillac ELR
* 2013–2019 Opel Cascada (also marketed as Vauxhall Cascada, Holden Cascada, Buick Cascada and Opel Cabrio)
* 2017–2021 Chevrolet Cavalier

==D2XX/D2UX==
General Motors introduced its new global platform named D2XX flexible platform in August 2012. The new platform was mainly engineered by GM&#x27;s former German subsidiary Opel in Rüsselsheim. According to GM the company invested US$220 million for the all new D2XX platform.

The platform was developed for compact vehicle architecture, replacing both Delta II and the midsize crossover GM Theta platform.

Vehicles that use the new platform included:

* 2015–2023 Chevrolet Cruze
* 2015–2022 Opel Astra K
* 2016–2019 Chevrolet Volt
* 2018–2024 Chevrolet Equinox 
* 2018–2024 GMC Terrain
* 2019–2023 Chevrolet Orlando
* 2014–2020 Buick Envision

=== GM-PATAC K ===
In 2015 Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC), GM&#x27;s joint development center with SAIC, revealed their own simplified variant of D2XX, known as the &quot;GM-PATAC K&quot; platform (rather than &quot;K&quot; so as to distinguish it from the former GM K platforms). The following vehicles use this variant of the platform, none of which are sold in the United States:

* 2015–2023 Buick Excelle GT
* 2016–2021 Chevrolet Cavalier
* 2017–2023 Buick GL6
* 2019–present Chevrolet Monza
* 2017-present Roewe i5/ Ei5

<text>George Curry (April 3, 1861November 27, 1947) was a U.S. military officer and politician. He was governor of New Mexico Territory from 1907 to 1910, and once it became a state he represented it in the 62nd United States Congress. Curry County, New Mexico, is named in his honor.

==Early life ==
He was born in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, on April 3, 1861, to George Alexander and Clara Madden Curry. He was the eldest of four sons. Curry&#x27;s mother was a graduate of Dublin University and his father was a mechanic who managed Greenwood Plantation. His father served as a captain in the Confederate Army and after the Civil War purchased Sevastopol Plantation. Curry&#x27;s father was a parish leader of the local Ku Klux Klan, and in 1870 he was ambushed and killed. Three years later Curry&#x27;s mother moved the family to Dodge City, Kansas, where Curry got his first job at age 12 working as a messenger boy for a mercantile company. Following his mother&#x27;s death in 1879, Curry moved to Lincoln County, New Mexico, where he worked on a cattle ranch until 1881. Over the next few years Curry held several jobs managing stores and hotels. He acted as post trader at Fort Stanton, and engaged in the mercantile and stock business until 1886.

==Career==
Curry began his political career at age 23 when he became a member of Colfax County&#x27;s delegation at the Democratic Territorial Convention in Albuquerque. He was deputy treasurer of Lincoln County, New Mexico, in 1886 and 1887, elected county clerk in 1888, county assessor in 1890, and sheriff in 1892. He served as a member of the Territorial senate in 1894 and 1896, serving as president in his final year in the body.

During the Spanish–American War he served in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders. He did not see action in Cuba, but did participate in the fighting in the Philippines.

After returning from the war, he became sheriff of Otero County, New Mexico in 1899. He then resigned to join the Eleventh Volunteer Cavalry where he served from December 16, 1899 to March 20, 1901 in the Philippines. Following the organization of provincial governments there, he was appointed as the inaugural governor of Ambos Camarines in 1901, the chief of police of Manila for the remainder of 1901, the governor of Isabela from 1903 to 1905, and the governor of Samar from 1905 to 1907.

He served as the 18th Governor of New Mexico Territory from 1907 to 1910, and upon the admission of New Mexico as a State into the Union was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-second Congress and served from January 8, 1912, to March 3, 1913.

Curry declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1912. He then engaged in the hotel business in Socorro, New Mexico, was private secretary to US Senator Holm O. Bursum in 1921 and 1922, and was a member of the International Boundary Commission from 1922 to 1927. In April 1932, he was falsely reported to have died in Hillsboro; Curry&#x27;s son Clifford unsuccessfully sued the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; for causing a heart attack upon reading the story in the newspaper. After retiring, Curry moved to a ranch near Cutter, and served as State Historian from 1945 until his death in Albuquerque on November 27, 1947, with interment in the Santa Fe National Cemetery. Curry County, New Mexico, was named in his honor.

== Magtaon Attack ==
On March 24, 1906, during the Pulahan Campaign as Governor of Samar, Curry negotiated with Cipriano &quot;Teducduc&quot; Amango and Isidro &quot;Otoy&quot; Pompac the Pulahan leaders of southeastern Samar. Assured that the Pulahan forces were falling from attrition, Curry negotiated to meet at a neutral small barrio not shown on most maps, Magtaon in Mapanas. For the negotiations the army garrison was replaced by a constabulary unit. Present for the negotiations were Curry, a constabulary honour guard and visitors. As the Pulahan began filing in they suddenly attacked, killing 22 constables, capturing several rifles and fleeing into the jungle. Curry barely escaped and in retaliation ordered &quot;in your operations outside the towns and barrios you may kill anyone you have reason to [believe] a pulahan&#x27;; those who were members of the &#x27;Magtaon band&#x27; were to be &#x27;exterminated&#x27;&quot;

<text>Alexander Stirling Calder (January 11, 1870 – January 7, 1945) was an American sculptor and teacher. He was the son of sculptor Alexander Milne Calder and the father of sculptor Alexander (Sandy) Calder. His best-known works are &quot;George Washington as President&quot; on the Washington Square Arch in New York City, the &quot;Swann Memorial Fountain&quot; in Philadelphia, and the &quot;Leif Eriksson Memorial&quot; in Reykjavík, Iceland.

==Education==
A. Stirling Calder was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of sculptor Alexander Milne Calder and Margaret Stirling. He attended city public schools, and enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Fall 1885, at age 15. He studied under Thomas Eakins for several months, until the teacher&#x27;s forced resignation in February 1886. Calder remained at PAFA, studying under Thomas Anshutz and James P. Kelly. Two of his sculptures were accepted for PAFA&#x27;s 1887 annual exhibition, a rare honor for a student.

His father designed and was then in the midst of executing, the extensive sculpture program for Philadelphia City Hall. Calder worked as an apprentice on the project during the summers, and is reported to have modeled an arm for one of the figures. He made his first trip to Europe in Summer 1889, and returned there to study the following year.

Calder moved to Paris in Fall 1890, where he studied at the Académie Julian under Henri Michel Chapu. The following year, he was accepted at the École des Beaux-Arts, where he entered the atelier of Alexandre Falguière.

==Career==

In 1892, he returned to Philadelphia and began his career as a sculptor in earnest. His first major commission, won in a national competition, was for a larger-than-life-size statue of Dr. Samuel Gross (1895–97) for the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Calder replicated the pose of Dr. Gross from Eakins&#x27;s 1875 painting &quot;The Gross Clinic&quot;. Another early commission was for a set of twelve larger-than-life-size statues of Presbyterian clergymen for the facade of the Witherspoon Building (1898–99) in Philadelphia.

In 1906, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1913.

In Pasadena, he modeled architectural sculpture for the Throop Polytechnic Institute (now the California Institute of Technology). He returned to the east coast in 1910.

In 1912, he was named acting-chief (under Karl Bitter) of the sculpture program for the Panama-Pacific Exposition, a World&#x27;s Fair to open in San Francisco, California, in February 1915. He obtained a studio in NYC and there employed the services of model Audrey Munson who posed for him – &quot;Star Maiden&quot; (1913–1915) – and a host of other artists. For the exposition, Calder completed three massive sculpture groups, &quot;The Nations of the East&quot; and &quot;The Nations of the West&quot;, which crowned triumphal arches, and a fountain group, &quot;The Fountain of Energy&quot;. Following Bitter&#x27;s sudden death in April 1915, Calder completed the &quot;Depew Memorial Fountain&quot; (1915–1919) in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Hermon Atkins MacNeil and Calder were commissioned to create larger-than-life-size sculptures for the Washington Square Arch in New York City. &quot;George Washington as Commander-in-Chief, Accompanied by Fame and Valor&quot; (1914–1916) was sculpted by MacNeil; and &quot;George Washington as President, Accompanied by Wisdom and Justice&quot; (1917–18) by Calder. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;Washington at War&quot; and &quot;Washington at Peace&quot;.

He sculpted a number of ornamental works for &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, the James Deering estate outside Miami, Florida. These included the famous &quot;Italian Barge&quot; (1917–1919), a stone folly in the shape of a boat, projecting into Biscayne Bay.

Two of his major commissions of the 1920s were the &quot;Swann Memorial Fountain&quot; (1920–1924) in Logan Circle, and the architectural sculpture program for the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (completed 1931), both in Philadelphia.

He was one of a dozen sculptors invited to compete in Oklahoma&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer Woman&quot; statue competition in 1926–27, which was won by Bryant Baker. In 1927, he was also commissioned by the Berkshire Museum to sculpt the woodwork and fountain of the Museum&#x27;s Ellen Crane Memorial Room in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

In 1929, he won the national competition for a monumental statue of Leif Eriksson, to be the gift of the United States to Iceland in commemoration of the 1000th anniversary of the Icelandic Parliament. Standing before the Hallgrímskirkja, the Lutheran cathedral in Reykjavík, and facing west toward the Atlantic Ocean and Greenland, the &quot;Leif Eriksson Memorial&quot; (1929–1932) has become as iconic for Icelanders as the Statue of Liberty is for Americans.

===Teacher===
Throughout his career, Calder frequently worked as a teacher. He was instructor in modeling at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art from 1899 to 1904. He taught at the National Academy of Design&#x27;s evening school, 1910–11, and alongside Hermon Atkins MacNeil at NAD, 1911–12. He taught modeling at the Art Students League of New York, 1918–22. He was never on PAFA&#x27;s faculty, but may have occasionally lectured there, where his friend Charles Grafly was instructor in sculpture.

==Personal==
Calder married portrait painter Nanette Lederer on February 22, 1895, and they lived in Philadelphia for the first decade of their marriage. They had two children: Margaret Calder Hayes (1896–1988) and Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Calder III (1899–1976). Calder contracted tuberculosis in 1905, and he and his wife moved to Arizona for a year, leaving the children with friends (to protect them from the disease). Once he recovered his health, the family was reunited in 1906, and settled in Pasadena, California. They moved back east in 1910, and settled in Croton-on-Hudson, New York.

Calder died in 1945. He is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. His memoir, &quot;Thoughts of A. Stirling Calder on Art and Life&quot; (1947), was published posthumously.

<doc id="872429" wikidata="Q5513871" url="?curid=872429" title="General Motors Kappa platform">
<text>Kappa was General Motors&#x27; subcompact rear-wheel drive automobile platform for roadster applications. The architecture debuted in the 2006 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky, and ended production in 2009. These vehicles generally have a &quot;M&quot; in the fourth digit of their VIN.

Kappa uses an independent suspension, short-long arm type, in front and rear. The Ecotec engine is widely used, as is a 5-speed manual transmission. A 5-speed automatic was available from January 2006.

In 2002, the Pontiac Solstice Concept was shown in two forms: a drivable roadster convertible, and a design study of a fastback coupe.

The Pontiac Solstice was received very well at the 2002 NAIAS. The drivable roadster concept car shown had been cobbled together from many different components, using a heavily modified portion of the Delta and Epsilon. The thinking was that this architecture might be heavily modified and used to produce the Solstice in the near future.

It is speculated that when General Motors decided to try to produce the Solstice as a highly styled, low-cost, low-volume niche vehicle for enthusiasts, it became apparent that there were no existing platforms that could be used to achieve the needs of a modern compact rear wheel drive roadster.

Therefore, the Kappa platform was developed to provide the necessary structure for a two-seat, rear-wheel-drive convertible. It features hydro-formed rails and a tunnel structure derived from the Corvette architecture and Sigma, and is designed for a short-long-arm suspension for the front and rear. It features rear wheel drive, longitudinal-mounted transmission and front-mid engine.

It has been stated by GM that the platform has only been designed to accommodate a single engine: the Ecotec. It has also been stated by GM representatives that this platform was only designed to be left-hand drive. However, there are aftermarket tuners that have already accomplished non-trivial engine transplants in Solstices.

Since the Solstice, GM has designed another roadster that looks substantially different, but shares the same underlying Kappa platform: the Saturn Sky. The Saturn Sky was styled after the pattern of the Vauxhall VX Lightning design. There is a European version built on the same platform, essentially a Sky Red Line model with Opel badging, EU spec mirrors and tail lights, and culturally appropriate door implememts, reviving the name of Opel GT. A GM Korea version of that variant was also produced under the name Daewoo G2X.

Three other concept vehicles were built on the initial Kappa platform, and shown at the 2004 NAIAS: The Vauxhall VX Lightning, The Saturn Curve and Chevrolet Nomad. All three cars were received reasonably well, but were not nearly as embraced as the original Solstice Concept.

The original 2003 Vauxhall VX Lightning Concept is the same size as the original Solstice Concept, and pieced together in the same manner as the 2002 Solstice Concept, and had been shown in Europe several months earlier, before the Kappa platform had been finalized and named (debuting approximately mid-May 2003, for Vauxhall&#x27;s centenary celebration). The Vauxhall VX Lightning is the styling pattern after which the appearance of the Saturn Sky is based. When the Vauxhall VX was shown at the 2004 NAIAS, the Lightning part of the name was dropped and the vehicle referred to in the literature at the show as merely the &quot;Vauxhall VX&quot;.

The Saturn Curve and the Chevrolet Nomad concept cars were built on &quot;modified&quot; versions of the Kappa platform, and exhibited 12 inches longer wheelbases, and 2+2 seating.

Another concept car, built by Holden and called the Torana TT36, was rumored to have started as a Kappa-based car with a twin-turbocharged V6, but the modifications necessary to accommodate the engine, transmission, and general vehicle size made it necessary to refer to the platform as &quot;based on architecture similar to the Kappa and the Corvette.&quot;

A hardtop coupe version of the Pontiac Solstice was produced for the 2009–2010 model years. Kappa production ended with General Motors&#x27; bankruptcy in July 2010. 

Spanish car maker Tauro used Solstices to market their version called Tauro V8. There is a misconception that people tend to believe that this company purchased the Kappa platform, but in reality they were conversions of existing cars.

==Shared components==

* The Solstice&#x27;s backup lights are from the GMT360 GMC Envoy
* The heating, ventilating, and air conditioning modules are from the Hummer H3
* The Solstice&#x27;s front fog lamp assembly is from the W-body Pontiac Grand Prix
* The Solstice&#x27;s steering wheel is from the Delta-based Pontiac G5

<doc id="872431" wikidata="Q2833178" url="?curid=872431" title="Alexander Milne Calder">
<text>Alexander Milne Calder (August 23, 1846 – June 4, 1923) (MILL-nee) was a Scottish American sculptor best known for the architectural sculpture of Philadelphia City Hall. Both his son, Alexander Stirling Calder, and grandson, Alexander Calder, became significant sculptors in the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Calder was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the son of a tombstone carver. He attended the Royal Academy in Edinburgh during which he worked for sculptor John Rhind, the father of sculptor J. Massey Rhind. Calder then moved to London, where he worked on the Albert Memorial. In 1868, he emigrated to the United States and settled in Philadelphia, where he studied with Joseph A. Bailly and attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.

==Career==
In 1873, he was hired by architect John McArthur Jr., to produce models for the sculptures adorning Philadelphia City Hall. The commission required more than 250 marble and bronze pieces and took Calder twenty years to complete. That same year, Calder was commissioned by the forerunner of Philadelphia&#x27;s current Association for Public Art, the Fairmount Park Art Association, to create an equestrian statue of Major General George Gordon Meade for Fairmount Park. Then in 1875, he won the competition for the colossal (37 foot tall) bronze statue of William Penn that was to crown the new City Hall&#x27;s tower. That portrait sculpture remains to this day the largest atop any building in the world.

Calder is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb.

He is known for directing such films as the seminal Australian New Wave picture &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; (1971), the Mordechai Richler adaptations &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974) and &quot;Joshua Then and Now&quot; (1985), the original &quot;Rambo&quot; film &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), and the comedies &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (1977), &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; (1979), and &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; (1989).

Kotcheff has been nominated for a Genie Award for Best Achievement in Direction, a Gemini Award for Best Direction in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series, and twice for the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or. He won the Golden Bear at the 1974 Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, and the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series for his work on &quot;Play for Today&quot;. He received the Directors Guild of Canada&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011, and the Academy of Canadian Cinema &amp; Television&#x27;s Board of Directors&#x27; Tribute Award in 2014.

He has been described by the Toronto International Film Festival as a &quot;talented, multi-faceted journeyman director in the tradition of Leo McCarey or Robert Wise.&quot;

==Early life==
Kotcheff&#x27;s name was registered in official documents as &quot;William Theodore Kotcheff&quot; in Toronto, where he was born into a family of Bulgarian immigrants, who changed their last name from &quot;Tsochev&quot; () to &quot;Kotcheff&quot; for convenience. His father was born in Plovdiv, and his mother was of Macedonian Bulgarian background, from Vambel, today in Greece, but grew up in Varna, Bulgaria. His birth name is Velichko Todorov Tsochev (, ).

==Career==
===Canadian television===
After graduating in English Literature from University College, University of Toronto, Kotcheff began his television career at the age of twenty-four when he joined the staff of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, with television in its infancy. Kotcheff was the youngest director on the staff of the CBC, where he worked for two years on shows such as &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot;, &quot;First Performance&quot; and &quot;On Camera&quot;.

===British television===
In 1958, he left Canada to live and work in the United Kingdom. He was soon followed by his compatriot Sydney Newman, who had been the Director of Drama at the CBC and then to the United Kingdom to take up a similar position at ABC Weekend TV, one of the franchise holders of the ITV network who also produced much of the nationally networked programming for the channel.

At ABC, Newman was producer of the popular &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; anthology drama programme, on which Kotcheff worked as a director between 1957 and 1960. Kotcheff was responsible for directing some of the best-remembered instalments. During &quot;Underground&quot;, transmitted live on 30 November 1958, Kotcheff was required to cope when one of the actors, Gareth Jones, playing a character who was to die of a heart attack, suddenly died of one himself, off-camera, while between scenes, leaving Peter Bowles and others to improvise.

More successfully, Kotcheff directed the following year&#x27;s &quot;No Trams to Lime Street&quot; by Welsh playwright Alun Owen. He also did &quot;Hour of Mystery&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Have You to Remember&quot; (1961) by Clive Exton, and episodes of &quot;BBC Sunday-Night Play&quot;, &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Espionage&quot;, &quot;First Night&quot;, &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, &quot;Drama 61-67&quot; and &quot;ITV Playhouse&quot;.

===Theatre===
Kotcheff also worked in the theatre. He directed the original 1964–65 West End production of the musical &quot;Maggie May&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre, which won the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Score of the Year and the Critics&#x27; Poll as Best New British Musical.

===British feature films===
Kotcheff made his first film with &quot;Tiara Tahiti&quot; (1962). He directed other features during the decade, including &quot;Life at the Top&quot; (1965) and &quot;Two Gentlemen Sharing&quot; (1969).

He also directed &quot;The Human Voice&quot; (1967) for British television, starring Ingrid Bergman from a story by Jean Cocteau and TV remakes of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; (1967) and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1968). He directed the concert &quot;At the Drop of Another Hat&quot; for TV.

Kotcheff directed the Australian film &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; (USA: &quot;Outback&quot;, 1971; re-released with its original title, 2012). It won much critical acclaim in Europe, and was Australia&#x27;s entry at the Cannes Film Festival. (In 2009, &quot;Wake in Fright&quot; was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray disc in a fully restored version.)

Kotcheff returned to television, directing the &quot;Play for Today&quot; production &quot;Edna, the Inebriate Woman&quot; (1971) for the BBC, which won him a British Academy Television Award for Best Director. In 2000, the play was voted one of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century in a poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute.

===Return to Canada===
He returned home to Canada, where he directed an adaptation of his friend and one-time housemate Mordecai Richler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; (1974) which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival making it the first English Canadian dramatic feature film to win an international award.

He wrote and directed &quot;The Trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel&quot; (1975) for Canadian television and was a production consultant on &quot;Why Shoot the Teacher?&quot; (1977).

===Hollywood===
In Hollywood, he directed &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (1977) which was a big hit. He followed it with the comedy &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; (1978) then wrote and directed &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot; (1979) which was critically acclaimed.

Kotcheff directed the Canadian film &quot;Split Image&quot; (1982), then had his biggest success to date with the Sylvester Stallone movie &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), the first in the Rambo series. He worked on another Vietnam-themed action movie &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; (1983), then returned to Canada to make &quot;Joshua Then and Now&quot; (1985), from the novel by Mordecai Richler.

Kotcheff directed &quot;Switching Channels&quot; (1988) and &quot;Winter People&quot; (1989), then had a big hit with &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot; (1989).

===Television===
In the 1990s, Kotcheff returned to directing for TV, working on various American series such as &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, and &quot;Buddy Faro&quot; as well as &quot;Casualty&quot; in the UK.

He did the occasional feature film such as &quot;Folks!&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Shooter&quot; (1995). He did TV movies like &quot;What Are Families for?&quot; (1993), &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1994), &quot;Family of Cops&quot; (1995), &quot;A Husband, a Wife and a Lover&quot; (1996), &quot;Borrowed Hearts&quot; (1997), &quot;Cry Rape&quot; (1999). He joined the staff of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, where he acts as executive producer and director.

==Personal life==
Kotcheff lives in Beverly Hills with his wife Laifun (nee Chung). They have two children: Alexandra, a filmmaker, and Thomas, a composer and pianist. He has three children from his previous marriage to actress Sylvia Kay: Aaron, Katrina and Joshua. Ted Kotcheff is also vegetarian.

In May and June 2013, he was invited to the Film Forum in New York City for a re-release of his film &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, restored by the Academy of Canadian Cinema &amp; Television.

In February 2016, Kotcheff applied for Bulgarian citizenship via the Bulgarian consulate in Los Angeles, and was granted this during a visit to Bulgaria in March.

Given his Macedonian heritage, Kotcheff served on the board of directors of the Macedonian Arts Council. According to Kotcheff, there is not a difference between North Macedonia and Bulgaria.

<text>First Blood is a 1982 American action film directed by Ted Kotcheff and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, who stars as Vietnam War veteran John Rambo. It also co-stars Richard Crenna as Rambo&#x27;s mentor Sam Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle. It is the first installment in the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise, followed by &quot;&quot; and is based on the 1972 novel &quot;First Blood&quot; by David Morrell, which many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the 1970s. 

In the film, Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran, must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by police and government troops near the fictional small town of Hope, Washington.

&quot;First Blood&quot; was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film was a box office success, grossing $125.2 million and becoming the 13th highest-grossing film at the domestic box office and the seventh highest-grossing film worldwide. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, it has been reappraised by critics with many highlighting the roles of Stallone, Dennehy and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre.

The film&#x27;s success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels (co-written by and starring Stallone), an animated television series, a comic books series, a novel series and several video games.

== Plot ==

In December 1981, John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran, traveling on foot, arrives in Hope, Washington after discovering an old war buddy died from the effects of Agent Orange. The local sheriff, Will Teasle, assuming Rambo is a drifter, transports him to the outskirts of town, telling him to move on. Rambo reverses course back into town, resulting in his arrest. While being processed at the police station, Rambo becomes defiant and Teasle&#x27;s deputies, led by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, abuse him, triggering flashbacks of the torture which Rambo endured in Vietnam. 

Rambo finally fights his way out of the sheriff&#x27;s station, regains his confiscated knife and flees into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with rifles, dogs and a helicopter. Galt blatantly disregards Teasle’s orders and attempts to shoot Rambo dead from the helicopter with a sniper rifle. Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter, causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Galt loses his balance and falls to his death on the jagged rocks in a gorge below. Rambo tries to surrender to Teasle, reasoning that Galt&#x27;s death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the deputies shoot at him and Rambo flees. Although Teasle discovers Rambo is a Green Beret warrior and Medal of Honor recipient, he continues his pursuit. 

Using guerilla tactics, Rambo subdues all the deputies. With the deputies incapacitated by injury, Rambo corners Teasle, holds a knife to his throat and threatens &quot;a war [Teasle] won&#x27;t believe&quot; if he does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The Washington State Patrol and Washington National Guard are dispatched to assist Teasle, along with Rambo&#x27;s mentor and former commanding officer Col. Sam Trautman. Trautman advises Teasle that if he desists, Rambo will move on and can be arrested elsewhere without incident; but, Teasle refuses. Trautman initiates radio contact with Rambo to persuade him to surrender, but Rambo refuses, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and citing that they “drew first blood”.

At the entrance of an abandoned mine, a National Guard detachment corners Rambo. Ignoring Teasle&#x27;s instructions to wait for his arrival, the guardsmen fire a rocket launcher, collapsing the mine entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. Teasle furiously berates the guardsman for disobeying his orders and demands that their leader Clinton Morgan dig out Rambo’s body. However, Rambo survives the attack, where he escapes the mine through a ventilation shaft, hijacks a military truck carrying an M60 machine gun and ammunition and returns to Hope to cause as much damage as possible in revenge. 

In an effort to distract the authorities, Rambo blows up a gas station, cuts power to most of the town, destroys a sporting goods store and shoots the sheriff&#x27;s station. Trautman, understanding that Teasle is outmatched, again tries to convince Teasle to leave Rambo. Teasle, seeing Rambo&#x27;s rampage as a personal attack, ignores Trautman&#x27;s orders again and tries to hunt for Rambo on the station&#x27;s roof, but Rambo manages to shoot and injure Teasle in a gunfight. 

When Rambo prepares to kill Teasle, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed unless he surrenders, reminding him that he is the last survivor of his outfit. Rambo vents about the horrors of war and his traumatic experiences like watching his friends give their lives in Vietnam, being treated poorly when returning home, being unable to hold a job and being forgotten despite his sacrifices. Rambo breaks down crying as he recounts how a good friend was killed by a Viet Cong child soldier using a shoeshiner box wired with explosives. After being comforted by a visibly disturbed Trautman, Rambo surrenders and is taken into federal custody, while Teasle is taken to a waiting ambulance for transport to the hospital.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In 1972, Lawrence Turman at Columbia Pictures bought the film rights to &quot;First Blood&quot; for $175,000. Richard Brooks was slated to direct, and intended to have the film be an allegory on differing American perceptions of World War II and Vietnam War veterans, with Sheriff Teasle portrayed more sympathetically than in the novel. The film would have ended with Teasle ordering his men to drop their guns to try to reason with Rambo, who would have then been fatally shot by an unknown assailant. Brooks planned to start shooting &quot;First Blood&quot; in New Mexico in December 1972. The film did not proceed because the Vietnam War was still underway and Brooks left the project.

Afterward, John Calley purchased the rights at Warner Bros. Pictures for $125,000 with the thought of casting either Robert De Niro or Clint Eastwood as Rambo. A screenplay was written by Walter Newman with Martin Ritt intended to direct. The film would have criticized American military culture and portrayed Colonel Trautman as the film&#x27;s villain, ending with both Rambo and Teasle dying. Sydney Pollack and Martin Bregman also considered directing the film, with Bregman hiring David Rabe to write a script. After Bregman departed Mike Nichols considered directing Rabe&#x27;s script.

William Sackheim and Michael Kozoll wrote the screenplay that would be the basis of the final film in 1977, originally intending for John Badham to direct. Producer Carter DeHaven purchased Sackheim and Kozoll&#x27;s script from Warner Bros. for $375,000. DeHaven secured the Cinema Group as a financer and hired John Frankenheimer as director with production to begin in Georgia. This was also the first version of the script in which Rambo survived the film. However, the project stalled again after the distributor Filmways was acquired by Orion Pictures.

After Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna of Anabasis Investments read the book, they got interested in doing an adaptation as the first production of their studio Carolco Pictures funded by &quot;in-house sources&quot;. They purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. for $375,000 and Sackheim and Kozoll&#x27;s script for $125,000 in 1981. Ted Kotcheff, who had been involved in the project in 1976, returned after Kassar and Vajna offered to finance one of his projects. Kotcheff offered the role of John Rambo to Sylvester Stallone, and the actor accepted after reading the script through in a weekend.

Various scripts adapted from Morrell&#x27;s book had been pitched to studios in the years since its publication, but only Stallone&#x27;s involvement prompted its production. The time since the end of the Vietnam War and Stallone&#x27;s star power after the success of the &quot;Rocky&quot; films enabled him to rewrite the script to make the character of John Rambo more sympathetic. Morrell&#x27;s book has Rambo kill many of his pursuers, and Kozoll and Sackheim&#x27;s draft had him killing sixteen people, but in the movie Rambo does not directly cause the death of any police or national guardsmen. Stallone also decided to let Rambo survive the film, unlike in the book. A suicide scene was filmed but Kotcheff and Stallone opted to have Rambo turn himself in at Trautman&#x27;s urging. Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script, which was performed by Larry Gross and David Giler.

=== Casting ===
Brooks originally wanted to cast Bette Davis as a psychiatrist and either Burt Lancaster or Lee Marvin as Sheriff Teasle. When the project was purchased by Warner Bros., Robert De Niro and Clint Eastwood were each considered for the role of Rambo. Ritt intended to cast Robert Mitchum as Teasle and Paul Newman as Rambo. Pollack considered Steve McQueen but then rejected him because they considered him too old to play a Vietnam veteran from 1975. James Caan, Burt Reynolds and Robert Redford were also considered.

Rabe developed his screenplay with Al Pacino in mind for the role and had several conversations with the actor, who wanted to portray Rambo as a force of nature after seeing the film &quot;Jaws&quot;. However, Pacino decided not to be involved because he found the story too dark and also after his request that Rambo be a lunatic was dismissed by the producers. When Badham was considered as director he wanted to cast John Travolta as Rambo, George C. Scott as Trautman, and either Gene Hackman or Charles Durning as Teasle. Frankenheimer considered Powers Boothe, Michael Douglas, and Nick Nolte as Rambo before casting Brad Davis because of his role in &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. Dustin Hoffman was offered the role of Rambo but turned it down.

For the role of Sheriff Teasle, Kassar and Vajna approached Academy Award winners Hackman and Robert Duvall but both turned the part down. Marvin, another Oscar winner, turned down the part of Colonel Trautman. James Mason and Richard Jaeckel were also considered. Kirk Douglas was eventually hired, but just before shooting began, Douglas quit the role of Colonel Trautman over a script dispute; Douglas wanted to retain the novel&#x27;s original ending of Rambo and Teasle fatally wounding each other, Trautman finishing Rambo with a kill shot, then sitting with the dying Teasle for the sheriff&#x27;s final moments. Douglas also wanted Trautman to have more screentime. Rock Hudson was approached as a replacement but was soon to undergo heart surgery and had to pass up the chance to work with Stallone. Richard Crenna was quickly hired as a replacement; the role of Trautman became the veteran character actor&#x27;s most famous role, a performance for which he received much critical praise.

=== Filming ===

The film was shot in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia on a $15 million budget beginning on November 15, 1981, and continuing until April 1982. The town scenes in the movie were shot in Hope and the nearby Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park, called Chapman Gorge in the film, while the rest of the movie was shot in Capilano Canyon, Golden Ears Provincial Park and Pitt Lake in Pitt Meadows. During the production Buzz Feitshans replaced producer Ed Carlin, who suffered a heart attack.

The locations chosen for the film initially experienced unseasonably warm and sunny weather during the filming, which posed challenges since the crew had counted on an overcast setting. However, a period of heavy snowfall beginning in January 1982 delayed the production by two months. Other delays were caused by injuries to the cast during stunts, including Stallone sustaining a serious back injury and several broken ribs, in particular, due to performing his own stunt of dropping off a cliff and into a tree. Since the production ran over schedule, Crenna&#x27;s role in the film was cut in order to avoid having to pay him higher fees as specified in his contract.

The firearms used in the film had to be imported into Canada because of the country&#x27;s firearms regulation. In January 1982 over $50,000 worth of firearms—including fourteen M16 rifles, three Remington shotguns, two .44 Magnum revolvers, and eleven Colt AR-15 rifles—were stolen from the set. Although the guns had been modified to shoot blanks, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed that they could be easily modified to fire live ammunition. After the incident the set was guarded by the Canadian Army, whose soldiers also served as extras in the film.

=== Post-production ===
The first rough cut of the film was between three and three-and-a-half hours long. According to Sylvester Stallone, it was so bad that it sickened his agent and him. Stallone wanted to buy the movie and destroy it thinking that it was a career killer. After heavy re-editing, the film was cut down to 93 minutes; this version was ultimately released in theaters. The ending used in the finished film was shot in March 1982, after the original one was deemed unsatisfactory.

Kassar and Vajna sought either Warner Bros. 20th Century Fox, or Paramount Pictures as a distributor, displaying an 18-minute promotional reel to studios. Although they secured international distributors, they were unable to locate a domestic distributor to the film until they sent a longer 55-minute reel to the American Film Market. After Warner Bros. and Paramount expressed interest, Orion Pictures agreed to the domestic distribution of the film.

== Music ==
The film&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, whose theme &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Road&quot; added a new dimension to the character, and featured in the film&#x27;s three sequels and animated spin-off. The soundtrack was originally released on LP by the Regency label, although it was edited out of sequence for a more satisfying listen. The album was reissued on CD with one extra track (&quot;No Power&quot;) twice, first as one of Intrada Records&#x27;s initial titles, then as an identical release by Varèse Sarabande. The complete score was released by Intrada in a 2-CD set, along with a remastered version of the original album (with the Carolco logo [previously released on La-La Land Records&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; album] and the &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; trailer music added), on November 23, 2010, as one of their MAF unlimited titles.

=== Home media ===
Author Morrell recorded an audio commentary track for the &quot;First Blood&quot; Special Edition DVD released in 2002. Actor Stallone recorded an audio commentary track for the &quot;First Blood&quot; Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004. This edition also includes a &quot;never-before-seen&quot; alternate ending in which Rambo commits suicide— a fate more in line with the original novel&#x27;s ending— and a &quot;humorous&quot; ending tacked on afterwards. A brief snippet of the suicide ending appears in a flashback in the fourth movie. Lionsgate also released this version on Blu-ray. Both commentary tracks are on the Blu-ray release.

Momentum Pictures released an HD DVD version of &quot;First Blood&quot; in the United Kingdom in April 2007. Lionsgate also released &quot;First Blood&quot; as a double feature on February 13, 2007, along with 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

The film was re-released as part of a 6-disc box set, which contains all four films in the series, on May 27, 2008. However, the box set is missing the David Morrell commentary, even though the packaging clearly states it is included. In anticipation of the release, the film was shown back in theaters for one night, May 15, 2008, through Fathom Events; the alternate ending was shown after the main feature.

&quot;First Blood&quot; was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on November 9, 2018.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;First Blood&quot; topped the U.S. box office for three weeks in a row, and its $6,642,005 opening weekend was the best October opening at the time. The film ended as a significant financial success, with a total gross of $51 million domestically, the highest-grossing film of the fall, and the 13th highest-grossing film of the year.

The film grossed $125.2 million worldwide, against a $15 million budget. It was notably the first major Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, where it was released in 1985. It sold tickets in China, the highest for a foreign Hollywood film up until 2018.

=== Critical response ===
The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and three lead actors received praise for their performances. In his review, Roger Ebert wrote that he did not like the film&#x27;s ending, but added it was &quot;a very good movie, well-paced, and well-acted not only by Stallone ... but also by Crenna and Brian Dennehy.&quot; He commented, &quot;although almost all of &quot;First Blood&quot; is implausible, because it&#x27;s Stallone on the screen, we&#x27;ll buy it,&quot; and rated the film three out of four stars. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Janet Maslin described Rambo as a &quot;fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero&quot; who is portrayed as a &quot;tormented, misunderstood, amazingly resourceful victim of the Vietnam War, rather than as a sadist or a villain.&quot; Maslin also praised the film&#x27;s story for its &quot;energy and ingenuity&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a mess&quot; and criticized its ending for not providing a proper resolution for the main character. &quot;Slash Film&quot; writer Jack Hawkins took a different view on the ending, praising the scene for containing &quot;the finest acting of Stallone&#x27;s career,&quot; adding, &quot;there are no one-liners, no showy acts of bravado, just messy emotion without any catharsis... Stallone couldn&#x27;t have played the scene better and neither could anyone else.&quot;

&quot;First Blood&quot; has been considered as belonging to the vetsploitation subgenre.

In 2000, BBC film critic Almar Haflidason noted that Stallone&#x27;s training in survival skills and hand-to-hand combat gave the film &quot;a raw and authentic edge that excited the audiences of the time.&quot;

Film.com and Filmsite regard &quot;First Blood&quot; as one of the best films of 1982, and in 2008 it was named the 253rd greatest film ever by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine on its 2008 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 86% approval rating based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Much darker and more sensitive than the sequels it spawned, &quot;First Blood&quot; is a thrilling survival adventure that takes full advantage of Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s acting skills.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

James Berardinelli of ReelViews called the film &quot;a tense and effective piece of filmmaking&quot;. He noted that the film&#x27;s darker tone, somber subtext, and non-exploitative violence allowed the viewer to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance. On Stallone&#x27;s performance, he wrote &quot;it seems impossible to imagine anyone other than Stallone in the part, and his capabilities as an actor should not be dismissed&quot;. In the 2010 edition of his Movie Guide Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and a half stars out of four, saying that it &quot;throws all credibility to the winds about the time [Rambo] gets off with only a bad cut after jumping from a mountain into some jagged rocks&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;First Blood&quot; received the most positive reception of the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise. The next four sequels received mixed or average reviews.

In a 2011 article for &quot;Blade Magazine&quot;, by Mike Carter, credit is given to Morrell and the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise for revitalizing the cutlery industry in the 1980s due to the presence of the Jimmy Lile and Gil Hibben knives used in the films. In 2003, &quot;Blade Magazine&quot; gave Morrell an industry achievement award for having helped to make it possible.

A writer from the American think tank Foundation for Economic Education commented that the sequence of events in the film are the result of police brutality. He goes on to say that Teasle&#x27;s initial approach with Rambo was without reason, and that he could have driven him to the diner or simply left him alone. He assigned blame to Teasle&#x27;s actions and compared the situation to a number of twenty-first century police encounters that turned deadly.

<doc id="872449" wikidata="Q5513854" url="?curid=872449" title="General Motors Epsilon platform">
<text>Epsilon is General Motors&#x27; mid-size front-wheel drive automobile platform. The architecture was a multi-division project of GM North America, Opel and Saab, and debuted in the 2002 Opel Vectra and 2003 Saab 9-3. Since this platform falls squarely in the center of the worldwide automobile market, GM plans to produce a great many Epsilon vehicles with over a dozen variations. , it was GM&#x27;s highest volume worldwide platform. Even after the dissolution of the GM/Fiat partnership, both companies retain the rights to continue developing Epsilon-derived models.

A total of 16 different models have made use of the GM Epsilon platform, some of which remain in production 19 years after the platform debuted.

==Features==

GM&#x27;s Epsilon platform replaced the N platform in the US, and replaced the GM2900 platform elsewhere. Vehicles of this platform generally carry the symbol &quot;Z&quot; in the fourth digit of their VINs.

When the platform debuted, there was talk of an &quot;Epsilon Wide&quot; derivative, which was supposed to have provided the underpinnings for the Buick LaCrosse and Saab 9-5. However, the program was cancelled and the LaCrosse was put on the W platform, and the 9-5 was given a quick refresh for the 2006 model year. 
The Epsilon platform is a midsize front-driver promising a 200 percent improvement in rigidity, with aluminum suspension components—MacPherson struts in front and a four-link independent arrangement in the rear, and four-wheel disc brakes. Many of the Epsilon vehicles use the Ecotec Inline-four engines and both the High Value and High Feature V6 engines.

The refreshed 2008 SAAB 9-3 debuted with an advanced version of all-wheel-drive it dubbed XWD, finally giving a definitive answer to rumors about the platform&#x27;s ability to support AWD, which had been around since the debut of the platform.

The Lambda and Theta Premium crossover platforms are derived from Epsilon.

==Epsilon II==
A new version of the Epsilon, dubbed Epsilon II, debuted in 2008. It is adaptable for front and all-wheel drive applications.

Many safety features and AWD fitment modifications were done by Saab.

<text>Seattle Public Schools is the largest public school district in the state of Washington. The school district serves almost all of Seattle. Additionally it includes sections of Boulevard Park and Tukwila. As of the 2021-2022 academic year, 106 schools are operated by the district, which serve 51,650 students throughout the city.

==Governance==
The board of directors for Seattle Public Schools is an elected body representing seven geographical regions, known as Districts, within the City of Seattle. The length of the term is four years. Board meetings are generally held twice monthly. For the 2019–2020 school year (until COVID-19 disruptions), board meetings were scheduled for the first and third Wednesdays of each month, at 4:15 p.m., with some exceptions. Its headquarters are in the John Stanford Center for Educational Excellence.

==History==

Thomas E. Peiser photographed a 1905 historical marker commemorating the site of Seattle&#x27;s first school. According to the marker: On this spot the first school in Seattle was taught by Mrs Catherine P. Blaine in January 1854. This tablet was erected by the Washington University State Historical Society November 13, 1905. Eagle Brass Fdy (foundry) Seattle.
Like most city school systems, the district has had to face controversy dealing with problems concerning racial tension, student population assignments, and administrative scandal; such incidents include a student boycott in 1966 and using &quot;racial tie-breakers&quot; which led to a 2007 Supreme Court case.

===Early schools===

When the University of Washington was founded as the Territorial University in 1861, its initial class offerings were not at a level that would now be considered those of a college or university. Its first class offering was a primary school (elementary school) taught by Asa Mercer, and for some years it was jointly supervised by the newly formed Seattle School Board its own Board of Regents. It functioned as Seattle&#x27;s first public school.

In 1867, the public school moved to what was then the County Building on Third Avenue between James and Jefferson, the site of today&#x27;s Prefontaine Fountain. A year later, the school moved to Yesler&#x27;s Pavilion (later Yesler&#x27;s Hall) at present-day First and Cherry. A year later the school moved again to a temporary building (called Bacon&#x27;s Hall after its first teacher, Carrie Bacon) located at the site of the present King County Court House. In 1870 the first &quot;permanent&quot; school building, the Central School, opened on Third Avenue between Madison and Spring Streets. It originally had two classrooms; a third was built in its attic in 1881.
Meanwhile, in 1873 the two-room North School opened at Third and Pine, and in 1875 the school district had purchased at 6th and Madison, where the Sixth Street School, also known as Eastern School, opened promptly in a temporary building and grew into successively larger and better-built buildings in 1877 and 1883. The latter, an &quot;elegant wooden building&quot; with an imposing &quot;French mansard roof, clock tower, and tall central belfry&quot; superseded the old Central School as well as the North School. From 1884, it was known as the Central School. Classes extended through 12th grade, and the first class graduated from 12th grade in 1886. However the school burned in 1888.

The district had, in this period, started a number of other schools, including the even more imposing Denny School on Battery Street between 5th and 6th Avenues in Belltown, opened 1884. Described as &quot;an architectural jewel... the finest schoolhouse on the West Coast,&quot; it was demolished in 1928 as part of the Denny Regrade project. When the Central School burned in 1888, its high school and first grade classes were parcelled out to the Denny School, other classes to the former downtown building of the university, with other classes going to temporary facilities, some of which also burned, in the Great Seattle Fire.

A new brick Central School opened in 1889 at Seventh and Madison, and was repeatedly expanded with annexes and extensions. After Seattle High School opened in 1902, the Central School was briefly known in 1903 as the Washington School before returning to its older name. The Central School functioned as an elementary school until 1938, and then until 1949 as the Central Branch of the Edison Technical School. The building was fatally damaged by the 1949 earthquake and razed in 1953; its site is now under Interstate 5.

===20th century===
In 1919, there were 64 grammar schools, six high schools, two parental schools (comparable to today&#x27;s youth detention centers), a school for the deaf, and nine &quot;special schools... for pupils who do not progress normally in regular classes.&quot;

In the early 20th century, Seattle Public Schools were &quot;exemplary&quot; under the leadership (1901–1922) of superintendent Frank B. Cooper and a series of &quot;civic-minded progressives&quot; who served on the Seattle school board.

===21st century===
In 2005, it was revealed that a teacher at Broadview-Thomson Elementary had been serially molesting children at the school for a period spanning several years. The teacher, Laurence E. &quot;Shayne&quot; Hill, had been molesting children for at least four of the twelve years he worked at the school, according to the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;. The article also said that several school officials had known of the inappropriate touching and did nothing to stop it, drawing outrage from concerned parents. Hill is serving his sentence as of December 2, 2005 and is facing anywhere from five years to life.

In June 2006, Andrew J. Coulson of the Cato Institute wrote a column in the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; taking the district to task for a page on &quot;equity and race relations&quot; on its website that indicated, in his words, that &quot;only whites can be racist in America&quot; and which, among other things, stated that &quot;Emphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology&quot; and that this and preferring a &quot;future time orientation&quot; were forms of &quot;cultural racism.&quot; The page was removed from the site the same day.

In June 2007, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, where they rejected Seattle Public Schools longstanding use of &quot;racial tie-breakers&quot; in assigning students to schools. The decision prohibited assigning students to public schools solely for the purpose of achieving racial integration and declined to recognize racial balancing as a compelling state interest. In a fragmented opinion delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, five justices held that the School Boards did not present any &quot;compelling state interest&quot; that would justify the assignment of school seats on the basis of race. Chief Justice Roberts wrote that &quot;the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&quot; Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurrence that presented a more narrow interpretation, stating that schools may use &quot;race conscious&quot; means to achieve diversity in schools but that the schools at issue in this case did not use a sufficient narrow tailoring of their plans to sustain their goals. Four justices dissented from the Court&#x27;s conclusions.

In January 2013, the entire teaching body of Garfield High School refused to administer the standardized Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, which is administered system-wide, three times per year. The teachers called the tests useless and a waste of instructional time. The American Federation of Teachers has endorsed the school&#x27;s boycott of the tests. Garfield&#x27;s boycott of the test quickly expanded to other Seattle schools and drew national attention. In May 2013 Superintendent Jose Banda announced that the Seattle School District will no longer require MAP tests at city high schools.

In September 2024 SPS announced two possible school closure lists it is considering to help address the $100 million budget deficit. One scenario would close 21 schools, keep 52 schools open, and save an estimated $31.5 million annually. The other scenario would close 17 schools, keep 56 schools open, and save an estimated $26 million annually. 16 schools appear on both closure lists, with K-8 and option schools heavily impacted.

<text>Bruce Kent (22 June 1929 – 8 June 2022) was an English Catholic former priest who became a political activist in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), holding various leadership positions in the organisation.

==Early life==
Born on 22 June 1929 in Blackheath, Southeast London, Kent was the son of Molly (Marion) and Kenneth Kent. He was educated in Canada before attending Stonyhurst College. He served as an officer in the Royal Tank Regiment from 1947 to 1949, and read Jurisprudence at Brasenose College, Oxford, from 1949 to 1952. In 1952, he began a six-year course studying for the priesthood at St Edmund&#x27;s seminary in Ware, Hertfordshire.

==Priesthood==
In 1958, Kent was ordained as a Catholic priest for the Diocese of Westminster and between 1958 and 1987 served in several London parishes, latterly becoming secretary to Cardinal John Heenan. Between 1966 and 1974, he was the Catholic chaplain to the University of London. He was chairman of the charity War on Want from 1974 to 1976.

In 1987, Kent retired from the priesthood. Contrary to some reports, he claimed to have never requested laicization and to have remained a priest. However, his canonically illicit marriage 14 months after his retirement incurred automatic laicization.

In 1992, he was a candidate for the Labour Party in the constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon, where he came third. Had he been elected, he would at the time have been prevented, as an ordained priest, from taking his seat in the House of Commons. Sitting Member of Parliament and Conservative minister John Patten, also a Catholic, retained his seat.

==Activism==
In 1960, Kent joined the Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a specialist section of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). He was CND&#x27;s general secretary from 1980 to 1985 and its chair from 1987 to 1990, and later held the honorary title of vice-president. In the 1980s, he led resistance to the deployment of the BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile at RAF Greenham Common.

From 1985 to 1992, Kent succeeded Seán MacBride as president of the International Peace Bureau. In 1997, he took part in the Musa Anter peace train to Diyarbakır, which aimed for a solution for the Kurdish-Turkish conflict. In a ceremony held on 19 October 2019, Kent was honoured with its MacBride Peace Prize. 

Kent was a patron of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.

In April 2021, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby awarded the Lambeth Cross for Ecumenism jointly to Kent and to his wife Valerie Flessati &quot;for exceptional, tireless and lifelong dedication to the Christian ecumenical search for peace, both individually and together.&quot;

Among his heroes was Franz Jägerstätter, the Austrian farmer who was executed in 1943 for refusing to fight in Hitler&#x27;s army. As recently as 15 May 2022, Kent took part in the annual ceremony in Tavistock Square, London, to honour conscientious objectors throughout the world.

==Personal life and death==
Kent married Valerie Flessati on 4 July 1988 and lived in Harringay, North London.

Kent died on 8 June 2022, at home, at the age of 92. At the time of his death, Bruce Kent was a Vice-President of CND, a Vice-President of Pax Christi, and Emeritus President of the Movement for the Abolition of War.

<doc id="872478" wikidata="Q6375833" url="?curid=872478" title="Kate Vaiden">
<text>Kate Vaiden (1986) is the 6th novel by American author Reynolds Price. The novel focuses on the life of a white woman from the American South who, after a teenage pregnancy, abandons her son shortly after giving birth to him and who does not get in touch with him for four decades.

==Plot summary==

Kate Vaiden is the first person narrator of the novel. When she sets out to tell the story of her life, she is a 57-year-old single woman. Having been diagnosed with cervical cancer seems to have changed her attitude to the family she left when she was seventeen without so much as writing them a letter—ever. Accordingly, she does not even know whether her son Lee, who must now be approaching 40, is still alive or not. In the final part of the book, which is set in 1984, she meets one of the last surviving members of her family, her cousin Swift, in a local nursing home. Swift eventually informs Kate that her son is alive and well but abroad with the US Navy.

===Kate&#x27;s story===

Kate is born in 1927 and grows up as an only child in Greensboro, North Carolina with her young parents Dan and Frances Vaiden. Her happy childhood is suddenly interrupted when, in 1938, for reasons she can never quite fathom, her father shoots her mother and then himself, leaving her to be raised by her aunt and uncle, Caroline and Holt Porter. The Porters, whose grown-up sons no longer live at home, reside in Macon, and Kate takes some time to get used to living in a small village. As they are not farmers, Kate does not have to work for them after school or during the holidays. Over the years, Noony Patrick, the Porters&#x27; African American household help, becomes her only friend and confidante.

Kate has her first sexual encounter surprisingly early in life—at the age of twelve, without having had any sex education. One summer afternoon down by the Roanoke River, Gaston Stegall, the neighbours&#x27; boy, shows her his erection, and she gives him a handjob, without really knowing what she is doing.

When she tells Noony, the sheer extent of Kate&#x27;s ignorance becomes clear:

At 13, Kate finally has sexual intercourse with Gaston. (&quot;When Gaston said he didn&#x27;t have a rubber, I swear I wondered what he needed to erase.&quot;) The lovers enjoy each other&#x27;s company undisturbed by the outside world for a few years, but when the United States enters World War II Gaston enlists in the army and is killed in a Marines camp before he can actually go to war.

At 16, Kate escapes her surroundings and everything that might remind her of Gaston by stealing off to Norfolk, Virginia, where her cousin, Walter Porter, is living with his orphaned &quot;friend,&quot; Douglas Lee, from back home. Having been ostracised from Macon, the two friends—whether they are actually a homosexual couple or not does not become clear—have never returned to their home town. However, Walter, who has a good job, promised Kate on the death of her parents that, whatever happens, she would always be welcome at his place. Now Kate takes him up on his word and is glad to see she is in no way regarded as an intruder.

Walter also takes care of Kate&#x27;s education and sends her to a Catholic school for girls—even though she is a Methodist. The trio get on very well with each other, but, with Walter frequently away on business trips, Kate starts a secret affair with Douglas—without being truly in love with him. When she gets pregnant—while abortion is never a serious option for her—she starts wondering what her future life will be like but in fact is unable to decide on any course of action.

While Walter is making plans for her to stay, Kate and Douglas secretly plan to move to Raleigh, North Carolina and live there as a family. They actually get on a train to Raleigh, but when it stops at Macon while Douglas is at the toilet, Kate gets out without saying good-bye to him. On the spur of the moment, she decides to spend the last months of her pregnancy at her aunt and uncle&#x27;s without the father of the child. In 1944, everyone has to get used to a young woman expecting an illegitimate child, but then Lee Vaiden is born and, as he is a strong, healthy boy, everything seems to be turning out fine.

However, Kate&#x27;s maternal instinct fails her soon after she has given birth:

Also, it occurs to Kate that a life without a man is not the right thing for her:

With Gaston and Douglas I&#x27;d used my body more ways than any white girl my age I&#x27;d read about or known. And for all the harm I&#x27;d caused the world, nothing convinced me my body was wrong and ought to be curbed. ... I couldn&#x27;t just maim that much of myself by bolting doors on the wide green world and camping-down forever in a house with no man near me under sixty years old.
One day, Kate decides to join Douglas in Raleigh and to leave her son in her aunt&#x27;s care. In Raleigh, unable to find Douglas, she makes the acquaintance of a young blind man called Whitfield Eller, who works as a piano tuner. Realizing that sooner or later she will have to take a job, Kate teams up with Eller, driving the blind man&#x27;s car to get him safely and on time to his customers. All the time, her plans to fetch the baby are somewhere at the back of her mind.

Without ever seeing his son, Douglas, who used to be Eller&#x27;s driver before Kate, commits suicide in Eller&#x27;s bathroom, obviously because of the high debts he has run up. When Eller proposes to Kate, the latter, who has turned out to be a quitter, once again leaves everything behind her and moves on—this time to Greensboro, where she joins her former teacher, Miss Limer. It is now that she finally abandons her son. She starts working in a library, becomes involved with Jay Mabry, a war veteran, but again backs out when he wants to get married. She spends the next decades as a single woman working in a lawyer&#x27;s office, never more than a two-hour drive away from her old home and, accordingly, easy to track down. We never learn why exactly it is that she is never contacted.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Kate Vaiden&quot; was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award.

<text>The Ford DEW platform (or DEW98) was Ford Motor Company&#x27;s midsized rear-wheel drive automobile platform. The D/E nomenclature was meant to express an intermediate size between D- and E-class vehicles, while the W denoted a worldwide platform. The platform was developed by both Ford and Jaguar engineers, and debuted in the Lincoln LS sedan. Its de facto predecessor in Europe was the DE-1 platform which underpinned the 1985 Ford Scorpio, however this vehicle was cancelled in 1998 without a direct replacement as in the European market, buyers were increasingly turning away from executive class cars manufactured by mainstream manufacturers.

Ford&#x27;s use of the platform ended in 2006, but Jaguar continued to use DEW98 after Jaguar was sold to Tata Motors in 2008, building the XF on it. Jaguar&#x27;s use of the platform ended in 2015 with the introduction of the second-generation XF using the Jaguar Land Rover iQ[Al] (D7a) modular platform.

==Vehicles==
This platform was used in these vehicles:
* 1999–2008 Jaguar S-Type
* 2000–2006 Lincoln LS
* 2002–2005 Ford Thunderbird
* 2008–2015 Jaguar XF

Cancelled vehicles that were to use this platform:
* 2004 Ford Fairlane 
* 2004 Lincoln D310 - became the CD3-based Lincoln Zephyr
* 2005 Ford Mustang - used the D2C platform instead

<text>Richard Peirce Brent is an Australian mathematician and computer scientist. He is an emeritus professor at the Australian National University. From March 2005 to March 2010 he was a Federation Fellow at the Australian National University. His research interests include number theory (in particular factorisation), random number generators, computer architecture, and analysis of algorithms.

In 1973, he published a root-finding algorithm (an algorithm for solving equations numerically) which is now known as Brent&#x27;s method.

In 1975 he and Eugene Salamin independently conceived the Salamin–Brent algorithm, used in high-precision calculation of formula_1. At the same time, he showed that all the elementary functions (such as log(&quot;x&quot;), sin(&quot;x&quot;) etc.) can be evaluated to high precision in the same time as formula_1 (apart from a small constant factor) using the arithmetic-geometric mean of Carl Friedrich Gauss.

In 1979 he showed that the first 75 million complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, providing some experimental evidence for the Riemann hypothesis.

In 1980 he and Nobel laureate Edwin McMillan found a new algorithm for high-precision computation of the Euler–Mascheroni constant formula_3 using Bessel functions, and showed that formula_3 can not have a simple rational form &quot;p&quot;/&quot;q&quot; (where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are integers) unless &quot;q&quot; is extremely large (greater than 1015000).

In 1980 he and John Pollard factored the eighth Fermat number using a variant of the Pollard rho algorithm. He later factored the tenth and eleventh Fermat numbers using Lenstra&#x27;s elliptic curve factorisation algorithm.

In 2002, Brent, Samuli Larvala and Paul Zimmermann discovered a very large primitive trinomial over GF(2):
:formula_5
The degree 6972593 is the exponent of a Mersenne prime.

In 2009 and 2016, Brent and Paul Zimmermann discovered some even larger primitive trinomials, for example:
:formula_6
The degree 43112609 is again the exponent of a Mersenne prime. The highest degree trinomials found were three trinomials of degree 74,207,281, also a Mersenne prime exponent.

In 2011, Brent and Paul Zimmermann published &quot;Modern Computer Arithmetic&quot; (Cambridge University Press), a book about algorithms for performing arithmetic, and their implementation on modern computers.

Brent is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, the IEEE, SIAM and the Australian Academy of Science. In 2005, he was awarded the Hannan Medal by the Australian Academy of Science. In 2014, he was awarded the Moyal Medal by Macquarie University.

<doc id="872485" wikidata="Q1402938" url="?curid=872485" title="The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (film)">
<text>The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is a 1974 Canadian comedy drama film directed by Ted Kotcheff, and adapted by Mordechai Richler and Lionel Chetwynd from Richler’s 1959 novel. It stars Richard Dreyfuss as the title character, a brash young Jewish Montrealer who embarks on a string of get-rich-quick schemes in a bid to gain respect. The cast also features Micheline Lanctôt, Randy Quaid, Joseph Wiseman, Denholm Elliott, Joe Silver and Jack Warden.

Winner of the Golden Bear at the 24th Berlin International Film Festival, &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; has been described as a &#x27;coming of age&#x27; for Canadian cinema, as both a widespread critical and commercial success internationally. It won the Canadian Film Award for Best Motion Picture, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film. The film has been designated as a &quot;masterwork&quot; by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.

==Plot==
Duddy Kravitz is a brash young Jewish man growing up in poverty in Montreal. His cab driver father Max and his rich uncle Benjy are proud of Duddy&#x27;s older brother Lenny, whom Benjy is putting through medical school. Only his grandfather shows the motherless Duddy any attention.

Duddy gets a summer job as a waiter at a kosher resort hotel in the Laurentian Mountains. His hustle and coarse manners irritate fellow waiter Irwin. Irwin gets his girlfriend Linda, the daughter of the hotel&#x27;s owner, to persuade Duddy to stage a clandestine roulette game. Unbeknownst to Duddy, the roulette wheel is crooked, and he loses his $300 earnings to Irwin and some hotel guests. The other waiters make Irwin give back the money. Unaware of this, the hotel guests feel bad and give him a further $500.

Duddy starts a romantic relationship with another hotel employee, French Canadian Yvette. One day, Yvette takes him on a picnic by a lake. Duddy decides he will buy all the property around the lake and develop it. Because he is under 21 and the owners might not want to sell to a Jew, he gets Yvette to front for him.

Duddy sets out to raise the money he needs. He hires blacklisted alcoholic film director Friar to film weddings and bar mitzvahs. The first film is a success, and more orders are quickly forthcoming.

When a piece of land comes up for sale, Duddy does not have enough money. He begs his father to get him an appointment with his friend Dingleman, a businessman-cum-gangster who had equally humble beginnings. Dingleman invites him to discuss his scheme on a train to New York but just wants a drug mule to unknowingly take the risk of smuggling heroin.

On the train, Duddy meets Virgil and offers to buy his pinball machines, which are illegal in the United States. Duddy does not have enough money to pay him, so he hires Virgil as a truck driver, even though he has epilepsy. Virgil has a seizure while driving and crashes; he is left paralyzed from the waist down. Blaming Duddy, Yvette leaves him to care for Virgil.

When the last piece of property Duddy needs comes on the market, Dingleman bids for it. Desperate, Duddy forges Virgil&#x27;s signature on a cheque to buy the land, leading to a rupture with Yvette and Virgil.

Duddy takes Max, Lenny, and his grandfather to see his property. When Dingleman shows up to offer to raise the financing for its development, Duddy mocks him. Duddy&#x27;s grandfather, however, refuses to pick out a plot for his farm, as Yvette told him what Duddy did to get it. Duddy fails to reconcile with Yvette, who never wants to see him again. In the final scene, Duddy has risen far enough that he can run a tab at the local diner, and his father boasts about how his son made it.

==Cast==
==Production==
Lionel Chetwynd was commissioned by John G. Kemeny to write a script based on Mordecai Richler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;. The first draft was sent to Richler, who then showed it to his friend Ted Kotcheff. Kotcheff said that he would direct the movie if Richler wrote the second draft of the script. The film was shot from 10 September to 14 November 1973, after $910,000 () was spent. $300,000 came from the Canadian Film Development Corporation and the remainder was raised by Gerald Schneider. Miklós Lente was the director of photography for the first two weeks of filming, but was replaced by Brian West.

The film was actually Kotcheff&#x27;s second adaptation of Richler&#x27;s 1959 novel. In 1961, he had directed a television play for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; based on &quot;Kravitz&quot;, with Hugh Futcher in the title role.

American producer Samuel Z. Arkoff was approached to make the film, but wanted to turn Duddy into a Greek character.

Few Canadians were cast in major roles because the Canadian film industry was underdeveloped at that time.

==Release==
&quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; premiered at the Place des Arts on 11 April 1974, and was theatrically released the next day. The film grossed $60,000 () at the Place Ville Marie and Towne Cinema one week after its release. The film was the most commercially successful English-language Canadian film ever made at the time of its release with a gross of $2.3 million in Canada. Including the U.S., the film earned theatrical rentals of $1.7 million. The CFDC made $334,888 from its investment in the film.

== Stage adaptation ==
In 1984 in Edmonton, Alberta, &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot; was adapted into a musical. A 1987 adaptation was directed by Austin Pendleton and premiered in Philadelphia. A newly updated version of the musical had its debut in Montreal in 2015 with music by Alan Menken, book and lyrics by David Spencer, and directed by Pendleton.

==Legacy==
&quot;Duddy Kravitz&quot; has an important place in Canadian film history due to its record gross, and has thus been described as a &#x27;coming of age&#x27; for Canadian cinema. The film has been designated and preserved as a &quot;masterwork&quot; by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a charitable non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada’s audio-visual heritage. The Toronto International Film Festival ranked it in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time twice, in 1984 and 1993.

In the period between shooting &quot;Duddy Kravitz&quot; and actually seeing the completed movie, Richard Dreyfuss was offered, and twice turned down, the role of Matt Hooper in &quot;Jaws&quot;; having read the script he decided that it was a film he would &quot;rather watch than be in&quot;. After he had seen the final cut of &quot;Kravitz&quot;, however, Dreyfuss felt his performance was so bad that it could potentially end his movie career. Discovering that the role of Hooper had still not been cast, he jumped at it to ensure that he was safely under contract to make another movie before anybody at Universal Pictures heard any negative press about &quot;Kravitz&quot;.

It was shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>Norman Joel Greenbaum (born November 20, 1942) is an American singer-songwriter, known for his 1969–1970 hit song &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;. The song makes Greenbaum one of the most famous and best-selling one-hit wonders of all time.

== Early life ==
Greenbaum was born in Malden, Massachusetts. He was raised in an Orthodox Jewish household and attended Hebrew school at Congregation Beth Israel. His initial interest in music was sparked by Southern blues music and the folk music that was popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He performed with various bands in high school and studied music at Boston University for two years. In college he performed at local coffeehouses but eventually dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1965.

== Career ==
In the late 1960s, Norman Greenbaum was the leader and composer for Dr. West&#x27;s Medicine Show and Junk Band, which recorded the novelty hit &quot;The Eggplant That Ate Chicago&quot;. The group&#x27;s psychedelic approach was too eccentric for mainstream show business; the group&#x27;s name suggested a novelty or comedy act incorporating music.

Greenbaum went solo as a folk artist and submitted an original song, &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, to Reprise Records. His demonstration recording was a simple folk rendition, with Greenbaum accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. Reprise handed Greenbaum to staff producer Erik Jacobsen, who radically rearranged the song for a new recording session. The updated version now had pulsing electric guitar, gospel-styled backup singers, and an insistent rhythm accompanying Greenbaum, whose vocal was now double-tracked. Reprise released the record in late 1969, and it skyrocketed to #1 in almost all worldwide markets. It sold two million copies in 1969 and 1970, and received a gold disc from the RIAA. It has subsequently been used in many films, advertisements, and television shows.

Although &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; has a clear Christian theme, Greenbaum is Jewish, having grown up in an observant Orthodox Jewish household, although he no longer practices the religion. Greenbaum says he was inspired to write the song after watching a Christian-themed song performed by Porter Wagoner on television. Greenbaum also stated Western movies were a major inspiration for &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;:

Norman Greenbaum: If you ask me what I based &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; on ... what did we grow up watching? Westerns! These mean and nasty varmints get shot and they wanted to die with their boots on. So to me that was spiritual, they wanted to die with their boots on.
Ray Shasho: So that was the trigger that got you to write the song?
Norman Greenbaum: Yes. The song itself was simple, when you&#x27;re writing a song you keep it simple of course. It wasn&#x27;t like a Christian song of praise it was just a simple song. I had to use Christianity because I had to use something. But more important it wasn&#x27;t the Jesus part, it was the spirit in the sky. Funny enough ... I wanted to die with my boots on.

All of the accoutrements added to &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; in the recording studio made it impossible for Greenbaum to replicate the recording in live performances. His televised appearance on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; compelled the singer to synchronize his performance to a playback of the hit record.

Greenbaum&#x27;s upbeat &quot;Canned Ham&quot; followed in 1970, and the record reached number 46 on the American charts and number 26 in the Canadian charts.

After the release in 1972 of his album &quot;Petaluma&quot; (named after his hometown in California), Greenbaum left the music business and returned to his dairy farm. He returned to the music industry as a manager and promoter in the mid-1980s. 

== Personal life ==
Greenbaum has been a long-time resident of Santa Rosa, California. On March 28, 2015, he was seriously injured when a car, in which he was a passenger, made a left turn in the path of a motorcycle on Occidental Road, killing the motorcyclist and injuring the motorcycle passenger. Greenbaum has since gone back to performing.

<text>The Abravanel family ( &quot;ʾAbravanʾēl&quot; or &quot;ʾAbarbənʾēl&quot;), also spelled as &quot;Abarbanel&quot;, &quot;Abrabanel&quot;, &quot;Avravanel&quot;, &quot;Barbernell&quot;, or &quot;Barbanel&quot; literally meaning &quot;Ab&quot; (&quot;father&quot;) &quot;rabban&quot; (&quot;priest&quot;) &quot;el&quot; (&quot;of God&quot;) is one of the oldest and most distinguished Jewish families. It first achieved prominence on the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. Its members claim to trace their origin to the biblical King David. Members of this family lived in Seville, Córdoba (Spanish province), Castile-Leon, and Calatayud. Seville is where its most prominent representative, Don Judah Abravanel, once dwelt.

Don Judah Abravanel was treasurer and tax collector under Sancho IV of Castile (1284–95) and Ferdinand IV of Castile (1295–1312). In 1310 he and other Jews guaranteed the loans made to the crown of Castile to finance the siege of Algeciras. He probably was almoxarife (&quot;collector of revenues&quot;) of Castile. Don Judah Abravanel and his family later fled to Lisbon, Portugal, where they reverted to Judaism and filled important governmental posts. His son, Judah (died 1471), was in the financial service of the infante Ferdinand of Portugal, who by his will (1437) ordered the repayment to him of the vast sum of 506,000 reis blancs. Later, he was apparently in the service of the Duke of Braganza. His export business also brought him into trade relations with Flanders. He was the father of Don Isaac Abrabanel and grandfather of Judah Leon Abravanel and Samuel Abravanel.

Another eminent member of the family was Samuel of Seville, of whom Menahem ben Aaron ibn Zerah wrote that he was &quot;intelligent, loved wise men, befriended them, was good to them and was eager to study whenever the stress of time permitted&quot;. He had great influence at the court of Castile. In 1388, he served as royal treasurer in Andalusia. During the anti-Jewish riots of 1391 he was forcibly converted to Christianity under the name of &quot;Juan Sánchez (de Sevilla)&quot; and was appointed comptroller in Castile. It is thought that a passage in a poem in the Cancionero de Baena, attributed to Alfonso Álvarez de Villasandino, refers to him.

Samuel Abravanel, Don Judah Abravanel&#x27;s grandson, settled in Valencia, and Samuel&#x27;s son, Judah (and perhaps Don Judah himself), left for Portugal. Isaac, the son of Judah, returned to Castile, where he lived until the time of the great expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Then, with his three sons, Judah, Joseph, and Samuel, Isaac went to Italy. Their descendants, as well as other members of the family who arrived later from the Iberian Peninsula, have lived in the Netherlands, England, Ireland, Germany, Turkey, Greece and American continent since the sixteenth century.

The high relative status of the family among the people of Iberia is indicated by a Ladino saying in Thessaloniki: &quot;Ya basta mi nombre ke es Abravanel&quot;, meaning &quot;My name is enough, and my name is Abravanel.&quot;

==Claimed descent from King David==
Don Isaac Abravanel wrote that his forebears were descended from King David, but this has been challenged on the grounds of lack of sources.

==Notable Abravanels==
Several of the more prominent members of this family include:
* Judah Abravanel was a receiver of customs at Seville, Spain, in 1310. He rendered substantial service to the grandees of Castile. The &quot;infante&quot; Don Pedro, in his will, dated from Seville, May 9, 1317, ordered that Judah be paid: (1) 15,000 &quot;maravedis&quot; for clothes delivered; (2) 30,000 &quot;maravedis&quot; as part of a personal debt, at the same time requesting Judah to release him from paying the rest. Judah had been in great favor with King Alfonso the Wise, with whom he once had a conversation regarding Judaism.
** Samuel Abravanel was the son of Judah Abravanel of Seville. He settled in Castile and became a patron of learning. He supported the scholar Menahem ben Zerah and had him elected rabbi of Toledo. As a mark of his gratitude, Menahem dedicated to Abravanel his work &quot;Ẓedah la-Derek&quot; (&quot;Provision for the Journey&quot;). During the persecution of 1391 he submitted to Christianity and was baptized, according to Zacuto, Juan of Seville. He soon, however, returned to Judaism.
* Don Isaac Abravanel, also Isaac ben Judah Abravanel or Abarbanel (1437–1508) was born in Lisbon, Portugal. He was a Jewish statesman, philosopher, Bible commentator, and financier.
** Judah Leon Abravanel, also Leon Hebreo, Leone Ebreo or Leo Hebraeus (c. 1460 – c. 1535), was a European Jewish physician, poet and philosopher, author of the &quot;Dialogues of Love&quot;, the eldest son of Don Isaac Abravanel.
** Joseph Abravanel (Lisbon, 1471 – c. 1552), son of Don Isaac Abravanel, was a physician and scholar. He lived in Venice and later in Ferrara, and enjoyed a great reputation.
*** Isaac Abravanel II (died 1573) was son of Joseph Abravanel and grandson of the Bible-commentator. He lived in Ferrara.
** Samuel Abravanel (Lisbon, 1473 – Ferrara, 1551) was the youngest son of Isaac Abravanel, and the grandson of Judah. His father sent him to Salonica to pursue his &quot;Talmudic&quot; studies, where he became the pupil of Joseph Fasi. He lived in Naples and was employed as financier by the viceroy Don Pedro de Toledo. Samuel was a patron of Jewish learning. His house was a favorite resort for Jewish and Christian scholars. The Portuguese refugee David ben Yachya, whom Samuel succeeded in placing as rabbi in Naples, and the Baruch of Benevento, a Kabbalist, were his close friends. Following in the footsteps of his father, and aided by his wife, Samuel was always ready to defend his fellow Jews. When Charles V issued an edict to expel the Jews from Naples, Benvenida, with the assistance of Leonora, intervened in their behalf so effectively that the decree was revoked. But several years later, when Charles V ordered the Jews either to leave the land or to wear the badge, the Abravanels settled in Ferrara, where Samuel died 1551, and Benvenida three years later.
* Yona Abravanel (died 1667) was a poet who lived in Amsterdam in the seventeenth century. He was the son of the physician Joseph Abravanel, and a nephew of Manasseh ben Israel. He wrote, in Portuguese, &quot;Elegio em Louvar da Nova Yesiba, instituido por o Senhor Yshac Pereira, de que he Ros Yesiba o Senhor Haham Menasse ben Israel&quot; (&quot;Elegy in Praise of New Yesiba, instituted by Lord Yshac Pereira, the Ros Yesiba of which is Lord Haham Menasse ben Israel&quot;, Amsterdam, 1644). He also wrote elegies upon the martyrs Isaac de Castro Tartas (1647) and the Bernals (1655). After 1630, with Dr. Ephraim Bueno, he published ritualistic works and &quot;Psalterio de David... transladado con toda fidelidad&quot; (&quot;Psalterio of David... translated with full fidelity&quot;, Amsterdam, 1644).
* Maurice Abravanel (b. 1903 in Saloniki, Greece – d. 1993 in Salt Lake City, Utah) was raised in Lausanne, Switzerland and, after emigrating to the USA, became the conductor of the Utah Symphony Orchestra.
* Senor Abravanel, better known as Silvio Santos (b. December 12, 1930 - d. August 17, 2024), a well-known Brazilian television host and owner of the Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão conglomerate.
* Patricia Abravanel, Brazilian TV hostess, producer and businesswoman
* Tiago Abravanel, Brazilian actor, voice actor and singer
* Yuri A. Barbanel, was a distinguished Soviet/Russian scientist in the field of physical chemistry, born in 1935.
* The family name exists in the forms &quot;Barbanel&quot;, &quot;Voronel&quot;, &quot;Abraben&quot; and &quot;Arnell&quot;.
* Boris Pasternak, the Russian 20th-century author of &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot;, whose family claimed to be descended from Isaac Abravanel.

* Max Nordau, the important writer and vice-president of the Zionist movement alongside Theodor Hertlz, belonged to the Abravanel family, as stated in his biography by his daughters Maxa and Anna Nordau. In that book, the Abravanel coat of arms is displayed (&quot;Max Nordau, a Biography&quot; by Maxa and Anna Nordau. New York 1943, translated from the French). In this book &quot;Frontispice&quot;, don Isaac Abravanel from the time of Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain is alluded to as their illustrious ancestor. Nordau spoke Spanish from familial tradition (the Sefardic modality).

<doc id="872497" wikidata="Q839596" url="?curid=872497" title="The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 film)">
<text>The Count of Monte Cristo is a 2002 American historical adventure film, which is an adaptation of the 1844 novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas, produced by Roger Birnbaum, Gary Barber, and Jonathan Glickman, and directed by Kevin Reynolds. The film stars Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Richard Harris, James Frain, Dagmara Dominczyk, Luis Guzmán and Henry Cavill in one of his earliest roles. It follows the general plot of the novel, with the main storyline of imprisonment and revenge preserved, but many elements, including the relationships between major characters and the ending were modified.

&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; was released in North America on January 25, 2002, to generally positive reviews from critics. It was commercially successful, grossing $75 million.

==Plot==
In 1815, Edmond Dantès, second mate of a French merchant vessel, and his friend Fernand Mondego, a representative of the shipping company, seek medical help on Elba for their ailing captain. Napoleon Bonaparte is in exile on the island. Having kept his guardians from killing the pair, Bonaparte privately requests that Edmond deliver a letter to the mainland in exchange for his physician&#x27;s services. Edmond is sworn to secrecy, but Fernand witnesses the exchange. In Marseille, the company owner, Morrell, commends Edmond for his bravery, promoting him to captain over first mate Danglars, who had given Edmond explicit orders not to land at Elba.

Fernand lusts after Edmond&#x27;s lover Mercédès and decides with Danglars to inform on Edmond regarding the letter, which reveals information that could be used to aid Bonaparte&#x27;s escape from Elba. Villefort, the city&#x27;s chief magistrate, has Edmond arrested. Villefort then learns that the letter is addressed to his own father Clarion, a Bonapartist. He burns the letter and orders Edmond imprisoned in the Château d&#x27;If, an island prison. In exchange for persuading Mercédès that Edmond has been executed for treason and that she should take comfort in Fernand, Villefort has Fernand assassinate Clarion.

Six years later, an eruption in the ground of Edmond&#x27;s cell reveals another prisoner, Abbé Faria, who has been imprisoned for eleven years after refusing to tell Bonaparte the whereabouts of the Spada family&#x27;s treasure. Faria has been digging an escape tunnel, but he dug in the wrong direction and ended up in Edmond&#x27;s cell. In exchange for Edmond&#x27;s help digging a new tunnel, Faria educates him in several academic and martial disciplines. Faria is fatally injured in a tunnel cave-in. Before dying, he gives Edmond a map to the treasure and implores him to use it only for good. Edmond escapes the prison by taking Faria&#x27;s place in the disposal of his corpse, and is thrown into the sea, pulling warden Armand Dorleac along with him and drowning him.

Wading ashore, Edmond encounters a band of pirates preparing to execute one of their own, Jacopo. Their leader, Luigi Vampa, decides justice and entertainment would be better served by pitting Edmond against Jacopo in a knife fight. Edmond wins but spares Jacopo, who swears himself to Edmond for life. They both work with the pirates until they arrive in Marseille. Edmond learns from Morrell, who does not recognize him, that Fernand and Danglars were complicit in his betrayal, his father committed suicide out of grief, and that Fernand and Mercédès have wed. With Faria&#x27;s map, he and Jacopo locate the treasure on the island of Montecristo. With his newfound wealth and comprehensive education, Edmond establishes himself in Parisian society as &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; with Jacopo as his manservant, and swears vengeance on those who conspired against him.

Edmond ingratiates himself to the Mondegos by staging the kidnap and rescue of their son, Albert. He lures Fernand, Villefort, and Danglars into a trap by letting slip the notion that he has located the treasure, and is shipping it through Marseille. His plans result in Danglars being caught red-handed in the act of theft, and Villefort being tricked into revealing his role in Clarion&#x27;s death; both are arrested. Fernand is brought to financial ruin as Edmond has his gambling debts called in. Even though his appearance has changed dramatically, Edmond is recognized by Mercédès. Eventually, she softens him, and they rekindle their relationship. As Fernand prepares to flee the country, Mercédès reveals that the only reason she married him was that she was pregnant with Albert, who is actually Edmond&#x27;s son.

Edmond ambushes Fernand in the ruins of his family&#x27;s country estate, having led him to believe that the treasure would be waiting for him. Albert intervenes when Edmond attempts to kill Fernand, but Mercédès tells him of his true parentage. Fernand attempts to flee, but changes his mind upon realizing that he has nowhere to go, and challenges Edmond to a fight to the death; Edmond prevails. Edmond purchases Château d&#x27;If, intending to raze it, but instead leaves it standing as he swears to Faria to use his fortune for good and departs with his new family.

==Cast==
==Production==
Most of filming took place on the island of Malta, where the capital of Valletta stood in for Marseilles. The fortified city of Vittoriosa, part of the Grand Harbour of Valletta, was chosen for its strong resemblance to early 19th century Port of Marseilles. The waterfront stretch of Vittoriosa known as Xatt Ir-Risq and Fort St Elmo featured specifically in the &quot;Marseilles&quot; scenes. The Grand Harbour had the added advantage of being one of a very few ports deep enough to allow the huge period sailing ships brought from the UK to dock. Saint Mary&#x27;s Tower on the island of Comino was used for the exteriors of the Château d&#x27;If; the Azure Window of Gozo also makes an appearance in the scenes set on the island of Montecristo.

In Ireland, locations included Powerscourt Estate, which stood in for the estate which Dantès buys and where he hosts his grand introduction to Paris society, while Kilruddery House appears as Mondego&#x27;s home early in the film. The climactic fight scene between Dantès and Mondego was filmed near Slane in County Meath.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on September 10, 2002. The latter release of the film is THX certified, featuring behind-the-scenes footage, audio commentary, deleted scenes and other bonus materials.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 143 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though it may not reach for any new artistic heights, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is an old-fashioned yet enjoyable swashbuckler.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing: &quot;&quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is a movie that incorporates piracy, Napoleon in exile, betrayal, solitary confinement, secret messages, escape tunnels, swashbuckling, comic relief, a treasure map, Parisian high society and sweet revenge, and brings it in at under two hours, with performances by good actors who are clearly having fun. This is the kind of adventure picture the studios churned out in the Golden Age—so traditional it almost feels new.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The official soundtrack for the film was composed and conducted by Edward Shearmur and performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra.

<doc id="872499" wikidata="Q5179649" url="?curid=872499" title="Cowell College">
<text>The first of the ten residential colleges of the University of California, Santa Cruz, established in 1965, Cowell College (Samuel Henry Cowell College) sits on the edge of a redwood forest with a remarkable view of Monterey Bay. The college is named for Henry Cowell and the Cowell family, who donated the land that UCSC is built upon, previously known as the Cowell Ranch.

==Living at Cowell==
Cowell College features seven dormitory buildings which are named after American historians, and architecturally reminiscent of English schools. Each building houses between 45 and 95 students in two clusters known as Upper Quad and Lower Quad.
The buildings are named as follows:
Adams, Prescott, Parkman (upper quad);
Beard, Parrington, Turner (lower quad); and
Morison (though Morison&#x27;s front entrance opens onto the lower quad, whether the dorm is upper or lower quad is a source of debate.)
Three buildings of apartments opened in 2004. Each apartment houses six or seven students in several bedrooms that share a living room, kitchen, and bathrooms.

These residence halls and apartments have resident assistants that live in the buildings in order to offer some counseling, programming, and guidance to the students living in Cowell. There are two resident assistants for each dormitory and five resident assistants for the apartments.

In the past, another building known as La Maison Francophone housed approximately 15 students who met weekly to speak French, study French culture, and put on events for the college. This building, located behind the Humanities and Social Sciences complex, now houses mostly teachers and graduate students, in addition to the Soviet Apartment, a communal living experiment occupied by students of the Russian language course.

Topped by a glass cupola, Cowell&#x27;s dining hall is one of Cowell&#x27;s best known visible features and has become one of the College&#x27;s icons. The dining hall serves as the primary eatery for Cowell and Stevenson College. This building was reopened following retrofitting during the 2008 school year.

==Cowell programs==
Cowell also features a wide variety of annual events and programs. For example, residential staff has in the past hosted a series of events each year known as the Cowell Olympics. Teams of students from the two quads, or each individual building are pitted against each other for prizes, their house name on an official Cowell Olympics plaque, and most recently, a banner to hang from the building&#x27;s balcony.

Along with college wide events, the Resident Assistants in the living areas are required to run 6 house events for each building every quarter. These can range from movie showings to nature trips to discussions on current events.

Cowell College also sponsors a UCSC a cappella group, Acquire. The group recently put on a large free show at Cowell called Acquirefest featuring all three on campus a cappella groups and some other guest groups. The event brought in over 400 people and has now become one of the school&#x27;s largest music events of the year.

==Notable features==
It is home to the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery, named in honor of Eloise Pickard Smith, the wife of Cowell&#x27;s first Provost, Page Smith. Cowell&#x27;s library, housing a small private collection of books, and another popular study spot, is named in his honor. An unofficial 24-hour silent rule exists in this space. In addition, Cowell owns many sculptures displayed around its campus, including the Cowell fountain and a statue dedicated to students who died in the Vietnam War. Cowell is also known for beautiful wisteria plants that bloom in the spring around the college. Cowell also has glass display cases that are used to display student and class art work. They are curated by a UCSC student.

Dating from the days of the old ranch, Cowell houses a Printing Press. A course is offered that teaches students about book making.

<doc id="872508" wikidata="Q580226" url="?curid=872508" title="Caladbolg">
<text>Caladbolg (&quot;hard cleft&quot;, also spelled Caladcholg, &quot;hard blade&quot;) is the sword of Fergus mac Róich from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

Fergus calls his sword by that name in &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;. Ailill mac Máta had stolen Fergus&#x27;s sword when he caught him &quot;in flagrante&quot; with Medb. Fergus carved a dummy wooden sword to disguise the fact he was unarmed. Ailill returns the sword to him before the final battle, and Fergus speaks a poem over it, calling it &quot;Caladcholc&quot; in one version, and &quot;Caladbolg&quot; in another. It is said to have been &quot;the sword of Leite from the elf-mounds. When one wished to strike with it, it was as big as a rainbow in the air.&quot; Prevented from using it against Conchobar mac Nessa, Fergus instead cuts off the tops of three hills.

A poem in the &quot;Duanaire Finn&quot; traces the ownership of sword through various figures of classical mythology and history, passing down from Saturn, via the heroes of the Trojan War, to Julius Caesar, to Cú Chulainn, who gave it to Fergus. After Fergus&#x27;s death, it was passed down through the generations from Medb, to Fionn mac Cumhaill&#x27;s grandson Oscar, and ultimately to Saint Patrick.

T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly argues that &quot;Caladbolg&quot; is the older form of the name, and interprets it as meaning &quot;hard lightning&quot;. He connects it with the Builg, an ancient people of Ireland (he identifies a subgroup of the Múscraige called the &quot;Dál Caladbuilg&quot;), as well as , the Welsh name of King Arthur&#x27;s sword Excalibur. Other sources connect similarly named swords with the legends of Arthur, Cú Chulainn, Fergus mac Léti and Fergus mac Róich.

The name Caladbolg appears in the plural as a generic word for &quot;great swords&quot; in the 10th-century Irish translation of the classical tale The Destruction of Troy, &quot;Togail Troí&quot;.

<text>The Latin League ( – 338 BC) was an ancient confederation of about 30 villages and tribes in the region of Latium near the ancient city of Rome, organized for mutual defense. The term &quot;Latin League&quot; is one coined by modern historians with no precise Latin equivalent.

==Creation==
The Latin League was originally created for protection against enemies from surrounding areas (the Etruscans) under the leadership of the city of Alba Longa. An incomplete fragment of an inscription recorded by Cato the Elder claims that at one time the league included Tusculum, Aricia, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Cora, Tibur, Pometia and Ardea.

==Roman leadership of the League==
During the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, the Latins were persuaded to acknowledge the leadership of Rome. The treaty with Rome was renewed, and it was agreed that the troops of the Latins would attend on an appointed day to form a united military force with the troops of Rome. That was done, and Tarquin formed combined units of Roman and Latin troops.

The early Roman Republic formed an alliance with the Latin League in 493 BC. According to Roman tradition, the treaty, the &quot;Foedus Cassianum&quot;, followed a Roman victory over the league in the Battle of Lake Regillus. It provided that both Rome and the Latin League would share loot from military conquests (which would later be one of the reasons for the Latin War 341–338 BC) and that any military campaigns between the two would be led by Roman generals. The alliance helped repel attacks from such peoples as the Aequi and the Volsci, tribes of the Apennine Mountains, who were prevented from invading Latium by the blending of armies.

It is still unclear if the Latins had accepted Rome as a member of the League, or if the treaty had been signed as between Rome and the Latin League.

==Wars with Rome==

During the Roman Kingdom and the early-to-mid Roman Republic there were numerous disputes between Rome and the Latins, which led to a number of wars between Rome and individual Latin cities and occasionally with the entire league.

The increasing power of Rome gradually led to its domination of the league. The renewal of the original treaty in 358 BC formally established Roman leadership and eventually triggered the outbreak of the Latin War (343–338 BC). Following the Roman victory, the league was dissolved.

After 338 BC, the end of the Latin league, Rome renamed the cities &quot;municipia&quot; and established &quot;coloniae&quot; inside them. This meant that the towns were now ruled by Rome (or the Roman Republic) and that the people living there were considered Roman colonists.

==Cities==
Alba Longa (founder – destroyed in the mid-7th century BC), Ardea, Aricia, Cameria (destroyed in 502 BC), Cora, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Pometia, Tibur, and Tusculum.
