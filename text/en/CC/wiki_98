<text>The Phaedrus (; ), written by Plato, is a dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus, an interlocutor in several dialogues. The &quot;Phaedrus&quot; was presumably composed around 370 BC, about the same time as Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; and &quot;Symposium&quot;. Although ostensibly about the topic of love, the discussion in the dialogue revolves around the art of rhetoric and how it should be practiced, and dwells on subjects as diverse as metempsychosis (the Greek tradition of reincarnation) and erotic love, and the nature of the human soul shown in the famous chariot allegory.

==Setting==
Socrates runs into Phaedrus on the outskirts of Athens. Phaedrus has just come from the home of Epicrates of Athens, where Lysias, son of Cephalus, has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is &quot;sick with passion for hearing speeches&quot;, walks into the countryside with Phaedrus. Socrates is hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech. They sit by a stream under a plane tree and a chaste tree, and the rest of the dialogue consists of oration and discussion.

The dialogue does not set itself as a re-telling of the day&#x27;s events. It is given in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story. This is in contrast to dialogues such as the &quot;Symposium&quot;, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day&#x27;s events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.

==Dramatis personae==
* Socrates
* Phaedrus
* Lysias (in absentia)

Lysias was one of the three sons of Cephalus, the patriarch whose home is the setting for Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. Lysias was perhaps the most famous &quot;logographos&quot; (λογογράφος, lit. &quot;speech writer&quot;) in Athens during the time of Plato. Lysias was a rhetorician and a sophist whose best-known extant work is a defense speech, &quot;On the Murder of Eratosthenes&quot;. In the speech a man who killed his wife&#x27;s lover claims that the laws of Athens required him to do it. The outcome of this speech is unknown.

==Summary==
The dialogue consists of a series of three speeches on the topic of love that serves as the subject to construct a discussion on the proper use of rhetoric. They encompass discussions of the soul, madness, divine inspiration, and the practice and mastery of an art.

As they walk out into the countryside, Socrates tries to convince Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has just heard. Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has a copy of the speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself to be used as a training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias&#x27; speech.

===Lysias&#x27; speech (230e–235e)===
Phaedrus and Socrates walk through a stream and find a seat in the shade. Phaedrus and Socrates both note how anyone would consider Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to his love of learning which &quot;trees and open country won&#x27;t teach,&quot; while &quot;men in the town&quot; will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading him out of his native land: &quot;Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out. A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books I don&#x27;t doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please.&quot;

Phaedrus then commences to repeat Lysias&#x27; speech. Beginning with &quot;You understand, then, my situation: I&#x27;ve told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out&quot;, the speech proceeds to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn&#x27;t create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn&#x27;t involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is &quot;more sick than sound in the head&quot; and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.

Socrates, attempting to flatter Phaedrus, responds that he is in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus&#x27; doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus&#x27; lead into his Bacchic frenzy. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates&#x27; subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.

Socrates retorts that he is still in awe, and claims to be able to make an even better speech than Lysias on the same subject.

===First speech of Socrates (237a–241d)===
When Phaedrus begs to hear it, however, Socrates refuses to give the speech. Phaedrus warns him that he is younger and stronger, and Socrates should &quot;take his meaning&quot; and &quot;stop playing hard to get&quot;. Finally, after Phaedrus swears on the plane tree that he will never recite another speech for Socrates if Socrates refuses, Socrates, covering his head, consents.

Socrates, rather than simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by explaining that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, and the other is our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following your judgment is &quot;being in your right mind&quot;, while following desire towards pleasure without reason is &quot;outrage&quot; (&quot;hubris&quot;).

Following different desires leads to different things; one who follows his desire for food is a glutton, and so on. The desire to take pleasure in beauty, reinforced by the kindred beauty in human bodies, is called &quot;Eros&quot;.

Remarking that he is in the grip of something divine, and may soon be overtaken by the madness of the nymphs in this place, he goes on.

The problem, he explains, is that one overcome with this desire will want to turn his boy into whatever is most pleasing to himself, rather than what is best for the boy. The boy&#x27;s intellectual progress will be stifled, his physical condition will suffer, the lover will not wish the boy to mature and take a family, all because the lover is shaping him out of desire for pleasure rather than what is best. At some point, &quot;right-minded reason&quot; will take the place of &quot;the madness of love&quot;, and the lover&#x27;s oaths and promises to his boy will be broken.

Phaedrus believes that one of the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy&#x27;s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one&#x27;s own lover. Impressing one&#x27;s own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy&#x27;s life.

The non-lover, he concludes, will do none of this, always ruled by judgment rather than desire for pleasure. Socrates, fearing that the nymphs will take complete control of him if he continues, states that he is going to leave before Phaedrus makes him &quot;do something even worse&quot;.

However, just before Socrates is about to leave, he is stopped by the &quot;familiar divine sign&quot;, his daemon, which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do something he should not. A voice &quot;from this very spot&quot; forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias&#x27; repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, and seemed to be showing off. Socrates states that he is a &quot;seer&quot;. While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him. Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.
===Second speech of Socrates (244a–257b)===

====Madness (244a–245c)====
Socrates begins by discussing madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches would have been correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of the best things we have. There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (&quot;theia mania&quot;), of which he cites four examples:
#From Apollo, the prophetic madness;
#From Dionysus, the initiatory or ritual madness;
#From the Muses, the poetic madness;
#From Aphrodite, erotic madness

As they must show that the madness of love is, indeed, sent by a god to benefit the lover and beloved in order to disprove the preceding speeches, Socrates embarks on a proof of the divine origin of this fourth sort of madness. It is a proof, he says, that will convince &quot;the wise if not the clever&quot;.

====The soul (245c–249d)====
He begins by briefly proving the immortality of the soul. A soul is always in motion and as a self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.

Then begins the famous chariot allegory. A soul, says Socrates, is like the &quot;natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer&quot;. While the gods have two good horses, everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.

As souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all of heaven so long as their wings are in perfect condition. When a soul sheds its wings, it comes to earth and takes on an earthly body that then seems to move itself. These wings lift up heavy things to where the gods dwell and are nourished and grow in the presence of the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the divine. However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.

In heaven, he explains, there is a procession led by Zeus, who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for Hestia, follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if it has not been properly trained. As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion to gaze at all that is beyond heaven.

What is outside of heaven, says Socrates, is quite difficult to describe, lacking color, shape, or solidity, as it is the subject of all true knowledge, visible only to intelligence. The gods delight in these things and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.

The immortal souls that follow the gods most closely are able to just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, having to deal with their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while straining to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers and artists have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.

Souls then begin cycles of reincarnation. It generally takes 10,000 years for a soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life three times in a row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.

====The madness of love (249d–257b)====
One comes to manifest this sort of love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no attention to what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.

When one is reminded of true beauty by the sight of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.

Beauty, he states, was among the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been recently initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not &quot;divine&quot; madness, but rather just having lost one&#x27;s head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome when they see a bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.

Socrates then returns to the myth of the chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is controlled by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of sex. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy&#x27;s face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy&#x27;s face, allowing the lover&#x27;s soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.

The lover now pursues the boy. As he gets closer to his quarry, and the love is reciprocated, the opportunity for sexual contact again presents itself. If the lover and beloved surpass this desire they have won the &quot;true Olympic Contests&quot;; it is the perfect combination of human self-control and divine madness, and after death, their souls return to heaven. Those who give in do not become weightless, but they are spared any punishment after their death, and will eventually grow wings together when the time comes.

A lover&#x27;s friendship is divine, Socrates concludes, while that of a non-lover offers only cheap, human dividends, and tosses the soul about on earth for 9,000 years. He apologizes to the gods for the previous speeches, and Phaedrus joins him in the prayer.

===Discussion of rhetoric and writing (257c–279c)===
After Phaedrus concedes that this speech was certainly better than any Lysias could compose, they begin a discussion of the nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn&#x27;t something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.

Phaedrus claims that to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is speaking on, but rather how to properly persuade, persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus&#x27;s words, harvest &quot;a crop of really poor quality&quot;. Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion; on the other hand, &quot;As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be&quot;.

To acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic divisions between two different kinds of things: one sort, like &quot;iron&quot; and &quot;silver&quot;, suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;justice&quot;, lead people in different directions. Lysias failed to make this distinction, and accordingly, failed to even define what &quot;love&quot; itself is in the beginning; the rest of his speech appears thrown together at random, and is, on the whole, very poorly constructed. Socrates then goes on to say,
:&quot;Every speech must be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must be neither without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole work.&quot;

Socrates&#x27;s speech, on the other hand, starts with a thesis and proceeds to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods. And yet, they agree, the art of making these divisions is dialectic, not rhetoric, and it must be seen what part of rhetoric may have been left out.

When Socrates and Phaedrus proceed to recount the various tools of speechmaking as written down by the great orators of the past, starting with the &quot;Preamble&quot; and the &quot;Statement Facts&quot; and concluding with the &quot;Recapitulation&quot;, Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare. He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body&#x27;s temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or come across some potions knows nothing of the art. One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, but it is not the knowledge of harmony itself. This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through &quot;Preambles&quot; and &quot;Recapitulations&quot;; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.

They go on to discuss what is good or bad in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, critically commenting on the gift of writing from the Egyptian god Theuth to King Thamus, who was to disperse Theuth&#x27;s gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.

No written instructions for an art can yield results clear or certain, Socrates states, but rather can only remind those that already know what writing is about. Furthermore, writings are silent; they cannot speak, answer questions, or come to their own defense.

Accordingly, the legitimate sister of this is, in fact, dialectic; it is the living, breathing discourse of one who knows, of which the written word can only be called an image. The one who knows uses the art of dialectic rather than writing:
:&quot;The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it happy as any human being can be.&quot;

==Interpretations and themes==

===Chariot allegory===
Plato paints the picture of a charioteer driving a chariot pulled by two winged horses:

&quot;First the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome.&quot;

The charioteer represents intellect, reason, or the part of the soul that must guide the soul to truth; one horse represents rational or moral impulse or the positive part of passionate nature (e.g., righteous indignation); while the other represents the soul&#x27;s irrational passions, appetites, or concupiscent nature. The charioteer directs the entire chariot/soul, trying to stop the horses from going different ways, and to proceed towards enlightenment.

Plato describes a &quot;great circuit&quot; which souls make as they follow the gods in the path of enlightenment. Those few souls which are fully enlightened are able to see the world of the forms in all its glory. Some souls have difficulty controlling the black horse, even with the help of the white horse. They may bob up into the world of the forms, but at other times enlightenment is hidden from them. If overcome by the black horse or forgetfulness, the soul loses its wings and is pulled down to earth.

Should that happen, the soul is incarnated into one of nine kinds of person, according to how much truth it beheld. In order of decreasing levels of truth seen, the categories are: (1) philosophers, lovers of beauty, or someone musical and erotic; (2) law-abiding kings or civic leaders; (3) politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; (4) ones who specialize in bodily health; (5) prophets or mystery cult participants; (6) poets or imitative artists; (7) craftsmen or farmers; (8) sophists or demagogues; and (9) tyrants.

One need not suppose that Plato intended this as a literal discussion of metempsychosis or reincarnation: perhaps he meant it figuratively.

Plato does not see the human soul as a sort of patchwork of emotions and concepts; this differs from the views of many philosophers of his time. Instead he views the soul as a sort of composite, in which many different elements blend together and affect each other. He uses the allegory of the charioteer to explain that love is a reflection of love of the forms, and is thus a &quot;divine madness,&quot; a &quot;theia mania&quot;.

===Madness and divine inspiration===

In the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Socrates makes the rather bold claim that some of life&#x27;s greatest blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. Phaedrus is Plato&#x27;s only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long palinode with his comment about listening to the cicadas. After originally remarking that &quot;landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do&quot;, Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as Pan and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the &quot;Symposium&quot;, is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the &quot;Ion&quot;, a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and literary criticism, madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato&#x27;s work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is the most beautiful thing of all.

===Pederasty===
The pederastic relationships common to ancient Greek life are also at the fore of this dialogue. In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming double entendres and sexual innuendo are abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates. As Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is &quot;straight-up, as they say,&quot; Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on. The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic. And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the &quot;Symposium&quot;. Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as &quot;friends&quot;: equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty. In the beginning, they sit themselves under a chaste tree, which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as &quot;monk&#x27;s pepper&quot;, it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an antaphrodisiac. Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.

===Rhetoric, philosophy, and art===
The &quot;Phaedrus&quot; also gives us much in the way of explaining how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates&#x27;s role as a &quot;midwife of the soul&quot; in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is &quot;for&quot; and what it can help one achieve.

The role of divine inspiration in philosophy must also be considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, and it is this divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.

Writing, examined separately but ultimately equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader&#x27;s soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing &quot;for the sake of amusing himself&quot; and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.

This final critique of writing with which the dialogue concludes seems to be one of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato&#x27;s ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato&#x27;s description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.

There is an echo of this point of view in the Seventh Letter, wherein Plato (or the pseudo-Platonic author) says not to write down things of importance. 

=== Soul: soul-leading; life as self-motion; self-motion and intelligence ===
Jessica Moss has argued that the entire unity of the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; is assured by the motif of soul-leading. The discussion of rhetoric, for instance, features the orator &quot;leading&quot; the soul to some decision or course of action. Socrates&#x27; great myth illustrates this motif most clearly when the soul is depicted as a charioteer and its horses, being led around a heavenly circuit. This is the occasion for the first appearance in Plato&#x27;s dialogues of the prominent Platonic doctrine that life is motion: the soul, being the principle (or source) of life, is that which moves itself, as opposed to inanimate objects that require an external source of motion to move them. The view that life is self-motion and that the soul is a self-mover is used by Plato to guarantee the immortality of the soul, making this a novel argument for the soul&#x27;s immortality not found in the &quot;Phaedo&quot;. Plato relies, further, on the view that the soul is a mind in order to explain how its motions are possible: Plato combines the view that the soul is a self-mover with the view that the soul is a mind in order to explain how the soul can move things in the first place (e.g., how it can move the body to which it is attached in life). Souls move things by means of their thoughts.

<doc id="872520" wikidata="Q11241809" url="?curid=872520" title="List of General Motors platforms">
<text>The American-based international automotive conglomerate General Motors (GM) underpins its many vehicle models with various platforms. These platforms are established sets of axles, suspensions, and steering mechanisms which fit various bodies and powertrains from various marques that GM owns.

From the early twentieth century, a Latin letter-based naming scheme was used to designate platforms, which were aimed at vehicles under different brands that served similar niches of the market. For example, the B platform was the base for fullsize, rear-wheel drive (RWD) sedans and wagons from 1926 to 1996. This platform underpinned vehicles made by Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Marquette, Pontiac, and Oldsmobile. During the 1970s and 1980s, GM introduced many new front-wheel drive (FWD) platforms for the first time, such as the FWD C platform introduced in 1985. Despite being mechanically very new and different, it kept the same name as the RWD C platform for the sake of consistency, as most of the models remained the same, such as the Oldsmobile 98. For most of these platforms, the platform name is the fourth character of a vehicle&#x27;s VIN, with a notable exception being trucks, for which it is the fifth character.

At the outset of the twenty-first century, General Motors&#x27; approach to platforms changed, and so did the nomenclature they use. Platforms themselves are now referred to by GM as &quot;architectures&quot;, and are now named according to the English-language names of letters from the Greek alphabet, such as the subcompact Gamma platform. Today, many of the since-discontinued Latin letter platforms are informally called &quot;bodies&quot;, such as &quot;J-body&quot;, which refers to the J platform. In the 2010s, GM once again began to change platform nomenclature, this time to a four-character format: platform-generation-XX. An example of this is the D2XX, from the &quot;second generation&quot; of the &quot;Delta platform&quot;, hence the &quot;D&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

All but three platforms listed here use a front-mounted engine, and those exceptions are noted in the &#x27;layout&#x27; column.

== In production ==
As of April 2020, GM produces cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) of multiple different sizes on 19 different platforms: 7 of which are inherently RWD, with the rest being FWD. All but 5 of these have four-wheel drive variants as well.
The GM nomenclature works as follows: 

1st position is the platform:
* A – Alpha
* C – Chi
* D – Delta
* G – Gamma
* E – Epsilon
* P – Premium Epsilon (XTS)
* Y – Corvette (Y-body)
* L – Lambda
* K – Trucks

2nd position is the platform generation.

3rd position is the body style:
* A – Convertible
* B – Coupe
* S – Sedan
* J – Hatchback
* K – CUV?
* L – Long Wheel Base Sedan
* M – Minispace
* U – Crossover/CUV (5 seater)
* Y – SUV/Truck (7 seater)

4th position is the Brand:
* B – Buick 
* C – Chevrolet
* G – GMC
* H – Holden
* L – Cadillac
* M – Citroën (partnership between GM &amp; PSA)
* O – Opel/Vauxhall

5th position is an optional qualifier: for example the Sales market area: 
* S – sales market China
* N – sales market North-America
* I – electric/hybrid

For example, E2UB-N is the Crossover Buick for the North-American market in the second generation of the Epsilon platform.
==Historical applications==
, GM has produced cars, trucks, and SUVs of multiple different sizes on 107 different platforms: 55 of these with Latin letters, 12 with English spellings of Greek letters, and 40 others. Also, 64 of these platforms are inherently RWD, while the rest are primarily FWD. Furthermore, 50 of these have four-wheel drive variants as well.

=== Latin-letter platforms ===
===Others===

== Future platforms ==
In 2015 GM announced their intention to shift all of their vehicles (with the notable exception of the eighth-generation Corvette) to four platforms by 2025. The following are those platforms, including the already-launched VSS-F:

It is currently unknown whether GEM or a similar low-cost platform will be continued in some form as a subset of VSS.

=== EV platforms ===

* BEV2, base of the Chevrolet Bolt and Chevrolet Menlo

* BEV3, base of the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Chevrolet Blazer EV

* Ultium, base of the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq

<text>A saildrive is a transmission system for a boat whose inboard engine has a horizontal output shaft. The saildrive&#x27;s input shaft is therefore also horizontal. That input shaft is geared so as to drive a vertical intermediate shaft extending downward through the hull. The intermediate shaft is then geared so as to drive a horizontal propeller shaft mounted on a skeg outside the hull.

The transitions from horizontal to vertical and then back to horizontal can be seen as a Z shape, and saildrives are indeed similar to the Z-drive transmissions used on larger vessels. The difference between a saildrive and a Z-drive is that a saildrive&#x27;s propeller shaft is fixed in place, pointing aft, whereas a Z-drive&#x27;s propeller shaft can be rotated to any azimuth.

Traditional sailboat transmissions consist of a simple horizontal output shaft extended rearward from the engine, through the stern via a stuffing box. The saildrive has several advantages over the traditional sailboat transmission: smaller horizontal size, no stuffing box to maintain, and the propeller is mounted horizontally instead of at a downward angle.

Saildrive also reduces propeller walk, reduces vibration, and is more efficient.

==History of the saildrive==

Among the earliest representatives of the technology was the OMC Zephyr Saildrive, produced from 1977 to 1984. This was a two-stroke gasoline engine to which oil needed to be added on a 50:1 mixture. It was a derated version of the 32 cubic inch engine block used at that time on the OMC Evinrude 25/30/35 hp outboards.

<text>The Ugra () is a river in Smolensk and Kaluga Oblasts in Russia, left tributary of the Oka. The east-flowing Ugra joins the north-flowing Oka at Kaluga and the united river, called the Oka, continues east to the Volga. In the 16th century, the Ugra-Oka confluence was the western end of a line of forts protecting Muscovy from Tatar raids. The river is known for the Great stand on the Ugra River. Its length is and its basin . It is frozen from late November (sometimes as late as January) until the end of March. 60% of its annual flow is snowmelt, mostly in April.

A part of the valley of the Ugra located in Kaluga Oblast belongs to Ugra National Park.

<text>A trick deck is a deck of playing cards that has been altered in some way to allow magicians to perform certain card tricks where sleight of hand would be too difficult or impractical.

==Trick decks==
===Brainwave deck===
The Brainwave deck is a lesser-known deck which is gaining in popularity, it operates on a principle similar to that of the Invisible Deck, but has vastly improved on it. With the cards still in their box, the magician asks a spectator to name a card. The magician pulls the deck out and fans the cards face down, then spreads through the deck until a single face-up card is discovered, which turns out to be the spectator&#x27;s card. For the grand finale the magician explains that he or she actually knew ahead of time which card the spectator would select, rather than having secretly turned it over during the performance. He or she then proceeds to prove this by turning the spectator&#x27;s card over and revealing that the card in question features a different backing pattern than every other card in the deck, suggesting to the audience that the magician may possess powers of extrasensory perception.

An inverse handling of the Brainwave deck is the X Deck, originally invented by Jay Sankey and identical to the Invisible Deck, but with the odd cards having an X on them. Both decks are meant to convey the idea that the magician did not perform the intended effect through the use of sleight of hand.

===Forcing decks===
These decks are used to force a spectator to select a particular card, which the magician already knows in advance. Such a feat can be accomplished using a regular deck and sleight of hand but with the aid of a forcing deck the trick is made self-working.

One of the simplest forcing decks is the &quot;one-way forcing deck&quot;, where all cards are identical (with the possible exception of one or two at the top and bottom of the deck). When using this deck, the magician must be careful to prevent the spectator from seeing the faces of the cards. The above-mentioned Svengali Deck can also be easily used as a force deck, by forcing the choice of one of the twenty-six identical short cards.

A variant of the one-way forcing deck is the Monte Cristo deck invented by Henry Hardin, more recently published under the name Mastermind Deck by Chris Kenworthey. All the cards are the identical force card, but misindexed on the top left corner, so that the cards all appear to be different when fanned or spread. Any card can be selected, and rotating the deck before revealing the selection will always reveal the force card.

It is worth noting that such decks have fallen out of favor amongst professional magicians because of an increased suspicion amongst audiences regarding the use of gimmick props. Thus, they are rarely employed.

===Invisible deck===
The invisible deck is one of the best known card tricks. Joe Berg created the Invisible Deck in the 1930s, originally calling it the Ultra Mental Deck. Often mistakenly credited to Dai Vernon, Don Alan or Eddie Fields, the most-used presentation of an &quot;invisible&quot; deck of cards was invented by J.B. Bobo.

The trick&#x27;s title stems from the classic presentation of this effect, in which the magician hands the spectator an imaginary, or &quot;invisible&quot; deck. On being handed the deck, the spectator is asked to mime the acts of removing the cards from their case, shuffling them, spreading them face-up on the table, freely selecting a card, replacing it face-down among the other face-up cards, and returning the deck to its box.

At this point, either the spectator keeps the imaginary deck while the magician removes the real deck from his pocket, or the spectator hands the imaginary deck to the magician, which suddenly becomes real in the magician&#x27;s hands. Michael Close also uses a handling in which the invisible deck is tossed back into a paper bag, whereupon it becomes real and visible. The magician then asks the spectator to name the card they selected, removes the deck, face-up, from its box and spreads the cards to show one face-down card. The spectator removes the card to find it is the one they named moments earlier.

In the more comedic version of the routine, more focus will be drawn to the part of the effect where the spectator is handling the cards. Often, the magician might criticize the spectator&#x27;s card-handling abilities, or remind him or her to take the cards out of the case before trying to shuffle them.

A more serious routine can be performed, which focuses more on the magician&#x27;s mindreading abilities and the fact that the spectator had a completely free choice of card. The magician could hand the spectator a box of cards to hold, ask him or her to think of, and concentrate on, any card in the deck, and then to name it. The spectator then hands the box back to the magician and the trick completed as before.

The invisible deck is prepared by arranging a normal deck so that all the even cards face one way and the odd cards the other. Cards are then slightly glued or stuck together into even-odd pairs, face out. When the spectator names his or her card, the deck is extracted from the box with the chosen parity, even or odd, facing the magician. The magician then fans out the cards until he see the spectator&#x27;s, which will be facing him. Applying a small amount of pressure, the card is split from its opposite member, revealing the back of the card for the spectator to see and choose.

The deck can be bought from magic dealers. It is also possible to construct the deck using a regular deck and additional materials from department stores.

===Marked deck===
A marked deck uses a marking system on the back of the cards to indicate their suit and value, so that a magician can identify a card without seeing its face. The two main methods used for creating a marked deck are &quot;reader systems&quot;, which hide the suit and value in the back design, or &quot;coded systems&quot;, where the suit and value is indicated by a code, e.g. a mark might be placed in a certain position to indicate the number of the card, with the color or shape of the mark indicating suit. Many marked decks are produced commercially, while some are created using card marking techniques similar to those used to cheat at gambling, e.g. by adding tiny punctures or dots. Some magicians may even mark a card during a performance, either with a sharpened finger nail or a tool (often a ring known as a &quot;poker ring&quot;) made specifically for that purpose.

===Rising card deck===
With a rising card deck, the spectator chooses a card and puts it back in the deck of cards. Then, the chosen card magically rises, whether it is in the box, in the hands, on a surface, or even in a wine glass.

The construction of these decks varies. The simplest of these, often described in amateur magic books, involves cutting a hole in the back of the carton so that the performer can surreptitiously push up the top card with their finger. More complex arrangements include a pair of cards gimmicked with an elastic band onto which the target card can be pushed (between the gimmicked pair), or a deck with a fine black thread passed across the top onto which the target card can be pressed down. There are without a doubt more complex and clever arrangements in use.

===Stripper deck===

A stripper deck (also known as a tapered deck, wizard deck, or biseauté deck) allows the magician to control the main location of a card or group of cards easily within the pack. Even after being shuffled into the deck by a spectator, the magician can cut to a selected card. Similarly, even after being lost in different parts of the deck, the magician can move multiple cards to specific locations using basic shuffles.

Unlike the invisible or svengali deck, the stripper deck can be handled by an audience member unfamiliar with the concept and can withstand a modest amount of scrutiny without exposing the secret; however, this deck is found in a number of beginners&#x27; magic kits, so the secret is well-known, even among non-magicians.

The cards of a stripper deck are slightly tapered, so that the sides no longer form a perfect rectangle. The change is slight enough to be undetected by visual inspection or even casual handling. However, if a single card is withdrawn and turned end-for-end before being reinserted, or if the remainder of the deck is thus turned, the broad end of the card can easily be detected by feel or sight at the narrow end of the deck. The magician can then control the card through sleight of hand.

Many of the effects achieved with a stripper deck can also be accomplished with sleight of hand.

===Svengali deck===
The svengali, or long-and-short deck, alternates between normal cards and shortened cards, with the shortened cards all of the same rank and suit. When the deck is riffled front to back, only the normal cards are visible; when it is riffled back to front, only the shortened cards are visible. It was created by Burling Hull and marketed by WD LeRoy in 1909.

The deck can be dribbled or riffled to create the illusion that the deck is completely ordinary. It can even be shuffled. One basic trick involves a spectator choosing a card from the deck and returning it; the card can then appear practically anywhere in the deck, making tricks like the Ambitious Card incredibly simple. The final and most stunning trick is when all the cards are suddenly presented as being all the same as the initially chosen card.

Joe Stuthard&#x27;s Trilby and Bi-Co Trilby Decks are variations on this deck. In the 1960s and 1970s, Marshall Brodien sold 17 million Svengali decks under the name TV Magic Cards. 

While the Svengali Deck allows for the easy performance of seemingly complex tricks, the conjurer cannot allow an audience member to examine the deck. The use of a Svengali Deck can also be detected by its characteristic faster riffle and sound. Finally, because the deck is widely sold in joke and novelty shops, many laypeople are familiar with it.

Writing pads or books using the same principle have also been created, to force the spectator to choose the content of a seemingly random page.

==Non-standard decks==
The following are not trick decks &quot;per se&quot;, but the cards they contain may be combined with a normal deck (or a packet of cards from a regular deck) in order to perform specific tricks.

===Gaff deck===
A gaff deck is a deck that contains cards used in conjunction with a normal deck. For the most part gaffed cards have the same back pattern as a standard deck of cards, but the faces are changed in various unique ways; for example, there may be two &quot;3½ of clubs&quot; cards, which might be used to split a 7 of clubs into two cards if called for. Gaff cards are sometimes included as bonus cards with a regular deck.

===Blank deck===
The cards in a blank deck have the same identical backs as in a standard deck, but the faces are entirely blank.

===Double blank deck===
All cards are completely blank on both sides.

===Double faced deck===
All cards have faces on both sides.

===Double back deck===
All cards have the standard backs on both sides.

==Standard deck setups==
There are many ways to order a deck so that the magician can perform special tricks. It is possible to use a stack, or ordered deck, to determine what card the spectator cut to. A popular stack to use for this is a Si Stebbins Stack. To make one, all a magician needs to do is order the cards so that each card is three values greater than the previous card, and so that the suits cycle consistently. For example: , , , , , , etc. The simplest way to use a Si Stebbins Stack is to let the spectator cut and replace the cards and look at the top card. They then replace the card on top and the magician takes the deck and peeks at the bottom card. Now, using the sequence of the Si Stebbins Stack, the magician adds three to the card value they peeked, and cycles one suit. Now they can continue the trick as usual. The Si Stebbins Stack also allows for more complex mind reading techniques using additional mathematical principles.

<text>Sven Birkerts (born 21 September 1951) is an American essayist and literary critic. He is best known for his book &quot;The Gutenberg Elegies&quot; (1994), which posits a decline in reading due to the overwhelming advances of the Internet and other technologies of the &quot;electronic culture.&quot; In 2006 he published a revised edition with new introduction and afterword, reflecting on the endurance of reading.

Birkerts was born in Pontiac, Michigan, and grew up in the metropolitan Detroit area. He graduated from Cranbrook School and from the University of Michigan in 1973.

After publishing several well-received books of collected essays on literature, Birkerts was appointed to many prominent editorial and teaching positions. He became the Director of the Bennington College Writing Seminars, a position he assumed after the death of Liam Rector. Birkerts was the editor of &quot;AGNI&quot;, the literary journal and has taught writing at Harvard University, Emerson College, Amherst College, and Mount Holyoke College.

He lives in Arlington, Massachusetts, with his wife Lynn. He has two children, Mara and Liam.

His father was noted architect Gunnar Birkerts, who based his practice in the Detroit area after immigrating to the United States following completion of his architectural degree in Stuttgart. He was born and grew up in Latvia, leaving as a young man before the Soviet Army occupied the nation in the last days of World War II.

<text>Moana Carcasses Kalosil (born 27 January 1963) is a Vanuatuan politician. He was Prime Minister of Vanuatu from March 2013 to May 2014. He was the first naturalized citizen of Vanuatu to become the country&#x27;s prime minister.

Carcasses was ousted as prime minister in 2014 in a motion of no-confidence, but returned to government in 2015 as deputy prime minister in the government of Sato Kilman. In October 2015, Carcasses and 13 of his fellow government MPs were imprisoned for bribery after the Vanuatu Supreme Court found that Carcasses had offered loans to the other MPs to gain their support in a motion of no-confidence while in Opposition.

==Biography==
Moana Carcasses was born on 27 January 1963 in Taravao, Tahiti, French Polynesia. His mother was ethnically Tahitian. His French father was originally from the region surrounding Carcassonne in Southern France.

===Political career===
He served as Foreign Minister under Prime Minister Edward Natapei from 2003 to 2004. Following parliamentary elections, he became Minister of Finance on 28 July 2004 under Prime Minister Serge Vohor. He kept the post of finance minister when Ham Lini became prime minister later in 2004. He remained in that position until 14 November 2005, when he was sacked by Lini for unclear reasons. 

He is a member of the Vanuatu Green Party (Green Confederation), which he led into the opposition when he lost his cabinet post in November 2005. On that occasion became deputy leader of the opposition.

In the September 2008 general election, he retained his seat, as well as the leadership of the Green Confederation, and became whip of the parliamentary Opposition to Prime Minister Edward Natapei&#x27;s government.

In December 2008, he and fellow Member of Parliament Ralph Regenvanu were arrested, detained by the police for 24 hours, and charged with &quot;harbouring and aiding of prisoners&quot;, &quot;obstructing police on duty&quot; and &quot;accessory after the fact&quot; to the breakout of 30 inmates from the country&#x27;s main prison in Port Vila. Although Regenvanu admitted having known of the plans for the breakout, and having assisted escapees in finding shelter at the &quot;Malvatu Mauri&quot; &quot;nakamal&quot;, it is not clear what role Carcasses allegedly played in these events. They were released, provisionally, and appeared in court in February 2009. In January 2009, Prime Minister Edward Natapei&#x27;s government stated that it would consider seeking Regenvanu&#x27;s and Carcasses&#x27; suspension from Parliament over the charges.

In September 2009, the Supreme Court dropped all charges against both men.

In December 2009, in the context of a Cabinet reshuffle, Carcasses left the Opposition and joined Natapei&#x27;s government, becoming Minister of Internal Affairs. In his latter capacity, he argued that unemployment in Vanuatu should be addressed by encouraging young people to return to agricultural work in their native rural areas, and produce their own food, rather than move to Port Vila where they would often struggle to find a job. He joined the Cabinet as the leader of an informal &quot;Alliance&quot; of MPs from a variety of small parties, and three independent MPs.

As Minister for Internal Affairs and Labour, he stated that he had prevented unqualified applicant Chinese labourers in the construction sector from obtaining or renewing work permits, &quot;because these people wanted to rob employment from ni-Vanuatu. My policy is that &#x27;man ples&#x27; [indigenous ni-Vanuatu] are the priority&quot;.

In December 2010, when the Natapei government was ousted in a vote of no confidence, Carcasses supported his successor Sato Kilman, and obtained a post as Minister of Finance and Economic Management in the new government. Kilman was himself ousted in a vote of no confidence on 24 April 2011, however, and Carcasses lost his position in government. He recovered it three weeks later, on 13 May, when the court of appeal voided the election of Serge Vohor&#x27;s new government on constitutional grounds, and the Kilman government was restored. This lasted for only a month; on 16 June, the Kilman premiership was itself voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and Carcasses lost office once more. He regained it on 26 June when Kilman was restored as prime minister by Parliament, and reinstated his Cabinet.

===Prime Minister of Vanuatu===
Carcasses retained his seat in the October 2012 general election, and maintained his confidence in the Kilman government, of which however he was no longer a member. He sat as a government backbencher until 20 March 2013, when he was one of 8 MPs to cross the floor, join the Opposition and force Kilman to resign. Three days later, Parliament elected Carcasses as prime minister, with the support of 34 MPs out of 52. He is the first foreign-born person to lead the country, and his predecessor objected to his election on those grounds.

In addition to his focus on the environment (including the creation of a Ministry for Planning and Climate Change), the press noted &quot;his unwavering support for the West Papua cause&quot;, and his opposition to Indonesia&#x27;s participation as an observer in the Melanesian Spearhead Group - a position which contrasted with his predecessor&#x27;s.

He entrusted his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Edward Natapei, with a clean-up of the selling of diplomatic passports by previous governments. Within the first few days of the Carcasses government, the passports of &quot;about ten&quot; diplomats were revoked, with indications that more than two-thirds of the country&#x27;s diplomats could lose their position, as their appointment had not followed proper procedures.

===Bribery===
In October 2015, Moana Carcasses and 13 other MPs were found guilty by the Vanuatu Supreme Court of bribery under the Penal Code. (An additional MP, Willie Jimmy, had already pleaded guilty, and another, Robert Bohn, was acquitted.) Carcasses was deputy prime minister at the time of his conviction. The court found that Carcasses, together with Tony Ngari MP, had offered bribes totalling $452,000 to the other MPs to secure their support in a motion of no-confidence to oust the government of Joe Natuman. The judge, Justice Mary Sey, refused to accept the defence argument that these payments were development loans. At one point during the trial, Carcassess was accused of threatening a witness. Additional charges of inappropriate giving of loans under the Leadership Code Act were dropped after it was ruled in a separate court judgement that the Ombudsman had not followed proper procedure in preparing a report into these allegations.

In the aftermath of the verdict, Carcasses called for calm and for people to respect the law. He was not among the MPs who faced additional charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after Speaker of Parliament Marcellino Pipite, one of the convicts, attempted to use his powers as Acting President to have himself and the others pardoned. Carcasses was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment; most of those whom he had bribed received 3-year jail terms. The case was widely acclaimed as a positive step towards tackling corruption in Vanuatu.

===Later career===
Kalosil ran for a seat in parliament representing Efate Rural Constituency for the Green Confederation in the 2025 Vanuatuan general election, which he lost.

==Personal life==
Kalosil is married to Marie Louise Paulette Milne, who became a deputy mayor of Port Vila and ran with her husband for parliament in the 2025 general election under the Green Confederation, in which she won a seat in Port Vila constituency.

<doc id="872590" wikidata="Q807232" url="?curid=872590" title="Barak Sopé">
<text>Barak Tame Sopé Mautamata (born 13 August 1950) is a ni-Vanuatu politician. He was the leader of the Melanesian Progressive Party and was, until 2008, a member of the Vanuatu parliament from the island of Efate. He was the Prime Minister of Vanuatu from 1999 until 2001, when he was deposed by Parliament in a no confidence vote.

Sopé was Minister of Finance in 1996. He was elected Prime Minister in a parliamentary vote on 25 November 1999, receiving 28 votes against 24 for Edward Natapei. Shortly after he was deposed on 13 April 2001, he was convicted on 2 charges of forging several million US dollars&#x27; worth of Vanuatu Government Guarantees and was sentenced in July 2002 to 3 years on each charge (to be served concurrently), but was pardoned in 2003 despite heavy opposition from Australia and New Zealand. When the coalition government of Serge Vohor was sworn in on 29 July 2004, Sopé became Minister of Foreign Affairs. He lost that position in November 2004 after he spoke out against Vanuatu&#x27;s attempts to establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan, reputedly due to his own dealings with the Chinese. He returned to the cabinet in December 2004 when the government of Ham Lini took office, taking up the post of Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

In the September 2008 general election, Sopé lost his seat in Parliament.

In September 2014, Sopé was a candidate in the indirect presidential elections. He was eventually defeated in the eighth round of voting by Baldwin Lonsdale.

<doc id="872591" wikidata="Q6590246" url="?curid=872591" title="List of Michigan state prisons">
<text>This is a list of current and former state prisons and minimum security prison camps in Michigan. It does not include federal prisons or county jails located in that State. All facilities not otherwise indicated are facilities for men.

Michigan State Prison (also called the Jackson Prison) was the first state prison, built in 1842. A larger prison building was built in 1926 and used until 2007. It was reorganized into separate prisons in 1988. The Detroit House of Corrections, built in 1861, was owned and run by the city of Detroit but originally accepted prisoners from throughout the state including women. The Detroit House of Corrections was transferred to the state in 1986, renamed to Western Wayne Correctional Facility, and became a women&#x27;s facility for the rest of its tenure. It eventually closed in December 2004 and all inmates and staff were transferred to the Huron Valley Complex in Ypsilanti. The closure of the facility saved the state an estimated $23 million per year. The Michigan Asylum for Insane Criminals was built in Ionia in 1885 and treated prisoners and non-prisoners until 1972. It was renamed the Ionia State Hospital before being the Riverside Correctional Facility until Riverside was closed in 2007. The Marquette Branch Prison was built in 1889 for Upper Peninsula prisoners and the original building is still in use.

==In operation==
As of September 2024, these facilities are open and in operation.

==Closed==
As of January 2014, these facilities are currently closed, or have been consolidated into other facilities.

=== Prisons ===

West Shoreline Correctional Facility closed on March 24, 2018

=== Minimum security prison camps ===
The minimum security prison camp program was ended in 2009 with the closures of Camp Cusino, Camp Kitwen, Camp Lehman, Camp Ottawa, and Camp White Lake.

<doc id="872593" wikidata="Q732753" url="?curid=872593" title="Horned screamer">
<text>The horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) is a species of bird that belongs to a relatively small family, the Anhimidae, which occurs in wetlands of tropical South America. There are three screamer species, the other two being the southern screamer and the northern screamer in the genus &quot;Chauna&quot;. They are related to ducks, geese and swans, which are in the family Anatidae, but have bills looking more like those of game birds.

==Taxonomy==
Already known in the 17th century, the horned screamer was described in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the binomial name &quot;Palamedea cornuta&quot;. The horned screamer is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Anhima&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The specific epithet &quot;cornuta&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;horned&quot;. The German naturalist Georg Marcgrave had used the Latin name &quot;Anhima&quot; in 1648 for the horned screamer in his &quot;Historia naturalis Brasiliae&quot;. The name was from the word for the bird in the Tupi language of South America.

==Description==
The horned screamer is a massive long, bird, with a small chicken-like bill. The upperparts, head, and breast are black, with white speckles on the crown, throat and wing coverts. There is a long spiny structure projecting forward from the crown. This structure is unique among birds and is not derived from a feather but is a cornified structure that is loosely attached to the skull and grows continuously while often breaking at its tip. This gives this species its name. It has very long and lanky legs and three large toes in each. The belly and under wing coverts are white. It has two sharp spurs on its wings and feet which are only partially webbed.

==Call==
The horned screamer&#x27;s call, as the name suggests, is a very loud and repetitive echoing sound. It is called &quot;el clon-clon&quot; in Ecuador because of this peculiar feature.

==Distribution and habitat==
The horned screamer is found in lowlands from Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana. It has been possibly extirpated from Trinidad. Despite having declined locally, it remains widespread and is fairly common overall. Its range in Brazil appears to have expanded in recent years. 
==Behavior==
Screamers, like most birds, tend to group together, but are for the most part semi-social. The existence of the screamer is rather sedentary. It lives in well-vegetated marshes and feeds on water plants.

==Breeding==
Its nest is a large pile of floating vegetation anchored in shallow water. Three olive-brown eggs are laid, and the young, like those of most Anseriformes, can run as soon as they are hatched.

==As a symbol==
The horned screamer is the official bird of both the Department of Arauca and the Municipality of Arauca in Colombia, as well as a symbol of the National Reserve of Churute in Ecuador. The department and its capital are named after the bird, which is called &quot;arauco&quot; or &quot;aruco&quot; in Spanish.

<text>Jacques Élisée Reclus (; 15 March 18304 July 1905) was a French geographer, writer and anarchist. He produced his 19-volume masterwork, &quot;La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes&quot; (&quot;Universal Geography&quot;), over a period of nearly 20 years (1875–1894). In 1892 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Paris Geographical Society for this work, despite having been banished from France because of his political activism.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Reclus was born at Sainte-Foy-la-Grande (Gironde) on March 15th, 1830. His family were part of the Protestant minority in France. His father, Jacques Reclus, was a Protestant pastor in Montcaret and taught at Sainte-Foy&#x27;s Protestant college; Reclus&#x27; godfather was the Protestant pastor Jacques Drillholle. Reclus&#x27; mother, Marguerite Zéline Trigant, was a teacher and founded a school at Orthez. Reclus spent his early years at the home of his maternal grandparents in Laroche, until he rejoined his family in 1838 at Castétarbe.

Reclus was the second son in a family of fourteen children. His brothers were Onésime, Élie, Paul, and Armand - who went on to be men of letters, politicians or members of the learned professions.

Reclus began his education in Rhenish Prussia, and continued higher studies at the Protestant college of Montauban, after he had studied for a baccalaureate at Sainte-Foy. While studying at Sainte-Foy, Reclus and his brother lived with their aunt. Reclus felt dissatisfied with his studies at Montauban, moving four kilometers away to study independently in a house with his brothers and their friend Édouard Grimard. In 1849, without authorisation to take leave from the school, Élisée, Élie and Edouard journeyed on foot from Montauban to the Mediterranean Sea; shortly after this episode, the Reclus brothers were expelled from the school, in part because of their political views.

Reclus moved to Berlin in 1851 and completed his studies at the University of Berlin, where he followed a long course of geography under Carl Ritter and also studied political economy and the history of diseases.

===Adult life and career===
Withdrawing from France due to the political events of December 1851, he spent the next six years (1852–1857) traveling and working in Great Britain, the United States, Central America, and Colombia. Arriving in Louisiana in 1853, Reclus worked for about two and a half years as a tutor to the children of cousin Septime and Félicité Fortier at their plantation Félicité, located about upriver from New Orleans. He recounted his passage through the Mississippi River Delta and impressions of antebellum New Orleans and the state in &quot;Fragment d&#x27;un voyage à la Nouvelle-Orléans&quot;, published in 1855.

On 11 March 1858, he was initiated in the regular Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge &quot;Les Émules d&#x27;Hiram&quot;, affiliated to the Grand Orient of France. His brother was just initiated and took part in his masonic baptism. He remained at the initial degrees of the Masonic spiritual path.

On his return to Paris, Reclus contributed to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, the &quot;Tour du monde&quot; and other periodicals, a large number of articles embodying the results of his geographical work. Among other works of this period was the short book &quot;Histoire d&#x27;un ruisseau&quot;, in which he traced the development of a great river from source to mouth. During 1867 and 1868, he published &quot;La Terre; description des phénomènes de la vie du globe&quot; in two volumes.

During the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), Reclus shared in the aerostatic operations conducted by Félix Nadar, and also served in the National Guard. As a member of the Association Nationale des Travailleurs, he published a hostile manifesto against the government of Versailles in support of the Paris Commune of 1871 in the &quot;Cri du Peuple&quot;.

Continuing to serve in the National Guard, which was then in open revolt, Reclus was taken prisoner on 5 April into Fort Quélern. On 16 November he was sentenced to deportation for life. Because of intervention by supporters from England, the sentence was commuted in January 1872 to perpetual banishment from France.

After a short visit to Italy, Reclus settled at Clarens, Switzerland, where he resumed his literary labours and produced &quot;Histoire d&#x27;une montagne&quot;, a companion to &quot;Histoire d&#x27;un ruisseau&quot;. There he wrote nearly the whole of his work, &quot;La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes&quot;, &quot;an examination of every continent and country in terms of the effects that geographic features like rivers and mountains had on human populations—and vice versa.&quot; This compilation was profusely illustrated with maps, plans, and engravings. It was awarded the gold medal of the Paris Geographical Society in 1892. An English edition was published simultaneously, also in 19 volumes, the first four translated by E. G. Ravenstein, the rest by A. H. Keane. Reclus&#x27;s writings were accurate and explained topics clearly, making them useful literary and scientific sources.

According to Kirkpatrick Sale:
In 1882, Reclus initiated the Anti-Marriage Movement. In accordance with these beliefs and the practice of &quot;union libre&quot; (&quot;free unions&quot;), which was common among working-class French in the mid-to-late 1800s, Reclus allowed his two daughters to &quot;marry&quot; their male partners without any civil or religious ceremonies, an action causing embarrassment to many of his well-wishers. Reclus had himself entered a free union in 1872, after the death of his first wife. In 1882 he also wrote &quot;Unions Libres&quot;, a pamphlet which detailed his anarchist and feminist objections to marriage. The French government initiated prosecution from the High Court of Lyon, arrested him and Peter Kropotkin as the International Association&#x27;s organizers, and sentenced the latter to five years&#x27; imprisonment. Reclus escaped punishment as he remained in Switzerland. 

In a 1913 piece, Kropotkin, in admiration of Reclus, said that if anyone asked about the conflicts of the Middle East, that &quot;I should merely open the volume of Elisée Reclus&#x27;s &quot;Geographie Universelle L&#x27;Asie, Russe&quot;...&quot;

In 1890, Reclus hosted Luigi Galleani at Lake Geneva in Switzerland, in the Reclus brothers&#x27; country house which at that time operated as a safe haven for disidents fleeing persecution. Reclus offered Galleani a role in writing his &quot;Universal Geography&quot;, with Galleani going on to contribute to statistics about Guetemala to volume XVII which addressed Central America. Reclus later assisted Galleani, and coordinated support for him, in fleeing Italy to Egypt when he faced persecution from the Italian state.
In 1894, Reclus was appointed chair of comparative geography at the Free University of Brussels, and moved with his family to Belgium. His brother Élie Reclus was at the university already, teaching religion. Élisée Reclus continued to write, contributing several important articles and essays to French, German and English scientific journals. He was awarded the 1894 Patron&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.

In 1905, shortly before his death, Reclus completed &quot;L&#x27;Homme et la terre&quot;, in which he rounded out his previous works by considering humanity&#x27;s development relative to its geographical environment.

===Death===
Reclus died on July 4th, 1905. He spent his final days in the countryside at Thourout, to the west of Brussels, staying with his friend Florence de Brouckère. Before he died, he completed the preface of the Russian edition of &quot;L&#x27;Homme et la Terre&quot;. His brother Paul, his sister Louise Dumesnil, and his nephew Paul were with him in his last moments. His daughter read him the news of the sailors&#x27; revolt on the &quot;Potemkin&quot;, and he smiled before dying peacefully.

Reclus was buried at a cemetery in Ixelles with his brother Élie, who had died in February 1904. Per Reclus&#x27; request, there was no funeral procession.

Kropotkin wrote an obituary for Reclus, which was published in &quot;The Geographic Journal&quot; in September, 1905. Kropotkin summarised:
Following Reclus&#x27; death, his sister Louise was responsible for his personal archive of correspondence, family documents, and publications, and his nephew Paul saw to the publication of his posthumous works.

==Naturism==
Reclus had strong views on naturism and the benefits of nudity. He argued that living naked was more hygienic than wearing clothes; he believed that it was healthier for skin to be fully exposed to light and air so that it could resume its &quot;natural vitality and activity&quot; and become more flexible and firm at the same time. He also argued that from an aesthetic point of view, nudity was better: naked people were more beautiful. His principal objection to clothing was, however, a moral one; he felt that a fixation with clothing caused excessive focus on what was covered.

==Personal life==
Reclus was a friend of Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta.

Without first being engaged and against the advice of his parents, Reclus married Marguerite Claire, known as Clarisse Brian (1832-1869) in a ceremony at Sainte-Foy-La-Grande on December 13th, 1858. Clarisse&#x27;s father was a French sea captain and her mother was a Senegalese woman. Clarisse and Élisée had two daughters together. Élisée and Clarisse&#x27;s first daughter, Marguerite (called Magali), was born on June 12th, 1860 at 10 rue Bénard in Paris&#x27; 17th arrondissement. The birth was witnessed by Élie Reclus and Édouard Grimard. Their second daughter, Jeanne (called Jeannie) was born on the 1st of March, 1863 at 7 rue de la Plaine in Paris&#x27; 17th arrondissement. The birth was witnessed by Gustave Hickel and Élie Reclus. Élisée insisted against baptising his daughters.

==Legacy==
Reclus was admired by many 19th century thinkers, including Alfred Russel Wallace, George Perkins Marsh, Patrick Geddes, Henry Stephens Salt, and Octave Mirbeau. James Joyce was influenced by Léon Metchnikoff&#x27;s book &quot;La civilisation et les grands fleuves historiques&quot;, to which Reclus contributed a foreword.

Reclus advocated for nature conservation and opposed meat-eating and cruelty to animals. He was a vegetarian. Reclus opposed the domestication of animals for food as a &quot;great evil&quot;, writing that &quot;domestication of animals exhibits in many ways moral regression since, far from im-
proving animals, we have deformed and corrupted them&quot;. Reclus connected humankind&#x27;s relationship with the natural world to property rights, the family household, and mutual aid. His ideas are seen by some historians and writers as anticipating the modern social ecology and animal rights movements.

The high school in Sainte-Foy-la-Grande is named for him.

<text>Cochabamba (; ) is a city and municipality in central Bolivia in a valley in the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cochabamba Department and the fourth largest city in Bolivia, with a population of 630,587 according to the 2012 Bolivian census. Its name is from a compound of the Quechua words &quot;qucha&quot; &quot;lake&quot; and &quot;pampa&quot;, &quot;open plain.&quot; Residents of the city and the surrounding areas are commonly referred to as &quot;cochalas&quot; or, more formally, &quot;cochabambinos&quot;.

It is known as the &quot;City of Eternal Spring&quot; or &quot;The Garden City&quot; because of its spring-like temperatures all year round. It is also known as &quot;La Llajta,&quot; which means &quot;town&quot; in Quechua. It is the largest urban center between the higher capital of La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the tropical plains of the east. It sits south-west of the Tunari mountains, and north of the foothills of the Valle Alto. In antiquity, the area featured numerous lakes, which gave the city its name. Many of these lakes have since disappeared to urban development, but Coña Coña and Alalay lakes are extant examples. It has been a populated settlement since the Pre-Inca period, and is today an important cultural, educational, political, and commercial centre.

==History==

===Pre-Inca and Inca===
The valley of Cochabamba has been inhabited for thousands of years due to its fertile productive soils and mild climate. Archaeological evidence suggests that the initial inhabitants were of indigenous ethnic groups: Tiwanaku, Tupuraya, Mojocoya, Omereque, and Inca inhabited the valley at times before the Spanish arrived.

The name Cochabamba is a Spanish spelling of the Quechua compound noun qucha pampa (literally &#x27;lake plain&#x27;, phonemically /qutʃa pampa/, phonetically [ˈqɔtʃa ˈpampa]). Under the Inca Empire, the area was conquered by Topa Inca Yupanqui (ruled 1471–1493). His son Huayna Capac turned Cochabamba into a large production enclave or state farm to serve the Incas. The local population was possibly depleted during the Inca conquest and Huayna Capac imported 14,000 people, called mitimas, to work the land. The principal crop was maize which could not be grown in much of the high and cold heartland of the Inca Empire. The maize was stored in 2,400 storehouses (qollqas) in the hills overlooking the valley or transported by llama caravan to storage sites in Paria, Cusco, of other Inca administrative centres. Most of the maize was probably used to sustain the Inca army during its campaigns.

===Spanish and Bolivian===
The first Spanish inhabitant of the valley was Garci Ruiz de Orellana in 1542. He purchased the majority of the land from local tribal chiefs Achata and Consavana through a title registered in 1552 at the Imperial City of Potosí. The price paid was 130 pesos. His residence, known as the House of Mayorazgo, still stands in the Cala Cala neighbourhood.

The city, called Villa de Oropesa, was founded on 2 August 1571 by order of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa. It was to be an agricultural production centre to provide food and wood for the mining towns of the relatively nearby Altiplano region, particularly Potosí which became one of the largest and richest cities in the world during the 16th and 17th centuries — funding the vast wealth that ultimately made Spain a world power. In fact, anthropologist Jack Weatherford and others have cited the city of Potosí as the birth of capitalism because of the money and materialism it provided Spain. Thus, with the silver mining industry in Potosí at its height, Cochabamba thrived during its first centuries. However, the city entered a period of decline during the 18th century as mining began to wane.

In 1786, King Charles III of Spain renamed the city the &#x27;loyal and valiant&#x27; Villa of Cochabamba. This was done to commend the city&#x27;s pivotal role in suppressing the indigenous rebellions of 1781 in Oruro by sending armed forces to Oruro to quell the uprisings. Since the late 19th century it has again been generally successful as an agricultural centre for Bolivia.

The 1793 census shows that the city had a population of 22,305 persons. There were 12,980 mestizos, 6,368 Spaniards, 1,182 indigenous natives, 1,600 mulattos and 175 African slaves.

In 1812, Cochabamba was the site of a riot against the Spanish Army. On May 27, thousands of women took up arms against the Spanish. According to historian Nathaniel Aguirre: &quot;From Cochabamba, many men have fled. Not one woman. On the hillside, a great clamour. Cochabamba&#x27;s plebeian women, at bay, fight from the centre of a circle of fire. Surrounded by five thousand Spaniards, they resist with battered tin guns and a few arquebuses; and they fight to the last yell, whose echoes will resound throughout the long war for independence. Whenever his army weakens, General Manuel Belgrano will shout those words which never fail to restore courage and spark anger. The general will ask his vacillating soldiers: &quot;&#x27;Are the women of Cochabamba present?&quot;&quot;

To celebrate their bravery, Bolivia now marks May 27 as Mother&#x27;s Day.

In 1900, the population was 21,886.

Besides a number of schools and charitable institutions, the Catholic diocese has 55 parishes, 80 churches and chapels, and 160 priests.

====Water War====


In 1998, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed to give Bolivia a loan of $138 million to control inflation and promote economic growth. However, it only agreed to do so on the condition that Bolivia sell &quot;all remaining public enterprises,&quot; including its national oil refineries and the local water company, SEMAPA. In 1999, a group of private investors, specifically the Bechtel Corporation with headquarters in San Francisco, California, United States of America, came together under the name of Aguas del Tunari and bought the rights for the privatization of the city&#x27;s water. In that same year, the World Bank (WB) refused to subsidize the water to help lower the cost for the people. Then in 2000, the people of Cochabamba began to protest as water priced hiked to a 50% increase that the majority could not afford. The Coalition for the Defense of Water and Life, and its leader Oscar Olivera, started a demonstration in &quot;La Plaza 14 de Septiembre&quot; also known as &quot;La Plaza Principal.&quot; The march was meant to be peaceful, but after two days the police used tear gas against the protestors and injured about 175 people and killed 1 and blinded two. Soon after, news reports were made about the protests and the violence. The Defense of Water and Life held an unofficial referendum and 96% of 50,000 people wanted Aguas del Tunari&#x27;s contract to terminate, but the government refused. The protests only grew and the entire world began to watch forcing Bechtel to leave its contract and return SEMAPA to the public. Bechtel as well tried to sue the Bolivian government for $50 million but it withdrew its claim shortly after. This event was soon labelled as the Water Wars and became a driving force for anti-globalization projects such as the UN&#x27;s decision to make water sanitation a human right and the privatisation of water as unethical in 2010. Additionally, the Water Wars would help spark the next revolt against the privatisation of natural gases from 2003 to 2005 which would lead to the removal of two presidents, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and Carlos Mesa, and the rise of President Evo Morales in 2006.

In January 2007, city dwellers clashed with mostly rural protestors, leaving four dead and over 130 injured. The first democratically elected Prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, had allied himself with the leaders of Bolivia&#x27;s Eastern Departments in a dispute with President Evo Morales over regional autonomy and other political issues. The protestors blockaded the highways, bridges, and main roads, having days earlier set fire to the departmental seat of government, trying to force the resignation of Reyes Villa. Citizens attacked the protestors, breaking the blockade and routing them, while the police did little to stop the violence. Further attempts by the protestors to reinstate the blockade and threaten the government were unsuccessful, but the underlying tensions had not been resolved.

In July 2007, a monument erected by veterans of January&#x27;s protest movement in honour of those killed and injured by government supporters was destroyed in the middle of the night, reigniting racial conflicts in the city.

In August 2008, a nationwide referendum was held. The prefect of Cochabamba, Manfred Reyes Villa, was not confirmed by the voters, and he was removed from the position.

==Climate==
Cochabamba is known for its &quot;Eternal Spring&quot;. Neither experiencing the humid heat of Santa Cruz nor the frigid winds of La Paz, Cochabamba experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;). The characteristic of the climate is an extended dry season that runs from May until October with a wet season that generally begins in November with the principal rains ending in March.

==People and culture==

Cochabamba is known as the heart of Bolivia and the gastronomic capital. Traditional cuisine includes: salteñas, chuño, tucumanas, pique macho, silpancho, anticucho, sopa de mani, chicharrón, charke, fricasé, rellenos de papa and many more dishes.

The international street art festival known as the BAU (Bienal de Arte Urbano) has been hosted in Cochabamba every two years since 2011. The festival is organized by , a local cultural centre. In 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 the painting was done in the Villa Coronilla, and Geronimo de Osorio neighbourhoods. In 2019 the festival focused on the neighbourhood Esperanza, on the edge of the Alalay Lake. The festival has featured internationally renowned artists such as Blu (Italy) and Inti (Chile).

Commensurate with other large cities in the Andean highlands of South America, Cochabamba is a city of contrasts. Its central commercial districts, Zona Norte, is bounded by Plaza Colón and Plaza 14 de Septiembre, are generally equipped with modern urban amenities and are where the majority of the city&#x27;s formal business and commercial industries are based. La Cancha, the largest open-air market in South America, is also an active place where locals can buy a range of items. An active nightlife is centered around Calle España and along the broad, tree-lined boulevard, El Prado. In contrast, the Zona Sur, a remote area adjacent to the Wilstermann International Airport is visibly impoverished, with adobe homes and unpaved roads, which is often the first impression visitors acquire while commuting into the city.

In 2009, the government under President Evo Morales created a new constitution that declared Spanish and 36 other indigenous languages as the official languages of the country. However, the most widely spoken languages in Cochabamba are Spanish and Quechua. Although the Spanish that is spoken in the Cochabamba region is generally regarded as rather conservative in its phonetics and vocabulary, the use of Quechua terminology (&quot;wawa&quot; [child] and &quot;wistupiku&quot; [mouth or twist lips]) has been widely incorporated into its standardized form.

As with most cities around the globe, English is increasingly spoken and understood, particularly among business-minded indigenous and repatriated Cochabambinos. English-language instruction has become incorporated into some private schools and universities but is not taught universally, therefore a vast majority of the population does not speak English.

About four-fifths of the population of Bolivia identifies as Catholic.

Like other cities that share the same ethnic group quadrants like Salta or Cuenca, Cochabamba&#x27;s demographics consist of the following visible groups in order of prevalence: Indigenous (mostly of Quechua and Aymara ethnicity) people, Mestizo, or mixed Indigenous and Spanish European, and people of Spanish (Criollos) and other European descent. As well as a fairly significant population of Afro-Bolivians.

By 2013, the human development index of the Metropolitan region of Cochabamba was 0.801 as a result of a 35% growth in the last 20 years.

==Government==
Cochabamba, formally the municipality of Cercado, is the capital of Cochabamba department. The city government is divided into executive and legislative branches. The mayor of Cochabamba is the head of the city government, elected by general election for a term of five years. The mayor heads an executive branch, which includes six sub-mayors and a variety of departments comprising 950 functionaries. The 11-member municipal council is the legislative branch.

The current mayor is Manfred Reyes Villa of the Súmate Movement, elected in 2021 for a 5-year term.

==Economy==


The area where Cochabamba is situated is commonly referred to as the granary of Bolivia. Its climate is milder than that of the Altiplano region to the west and thus permits extensive agriculture, including grains, potatoes, and coffee in the highlands and sugar cane, cocoa beans, tobacco, and fruit in the Chapare tropical lowlands of the South American Amazon region, an area that had been one of the country&#x27;s main coca-leaf-producing regions.

Cochabamba is also the industrial hub of Bolivia, producing cars, cleaning products, cosmetics, chemicals, and cement. The economy of Cochabamba is characterized by producing goods and services. Recently, the software industry is becoming increasingly important. International companies like GOJA and Assuresoft also have subsidiaries in Cochabamba. Due to this industry growth, Cochabamba is called the &quot;Silicon Valley of Bolivia&quot;, with a high demand for professionals immersed in technological careers such as Systems Engineering, Telecommunications and Information Technology.

The airline Boliviana de Aviación has its headquarters in Cochabamba. The defunct airline Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano (LAB Airlines) had its management offices on the grounds of Jorge Wilstermann Airport in Cochabamba. In Cochabamba construction has been rapidly increasing in the last couple of years with more than 750 construction sites per year.

Narcotrafic is now controlled in Cochabamba, which used to be related to cocaine dealers several years ago.

EMSA covers 88% of the city and collects 400 tonnes of waste produced per day. Through the municipal government of Cochabamba, special containers made available throughout the city for the storage of solid waste common. The municipality&#x27;s sole disposal facility, the K&#x27;ara K&#x27;ara waste dump (Botadero K&#x27;ara K&#x27;ara), has been the centre of a long-running controversy over pollution of the air and groundwater; it is frequently blockaded by neighbouring residents demanding changes.

<doc id="872612" wikidata="Q663723" url="?curid=872612" title="Lagitupu Tuilimu">
<text>Lagitupu Tulimu is a political figure from the Pacific nation of Tuvalu, who represented the constituency of Nanumea. He served as the acting prime minister, and foreign minister, from 8 December 2000 to 24 February 2001 following the death of incumbent Ionatana Ionatana.

==Early political career==
He became deputy prime minister and minister of finance in April 1999, when Ionatana Ionatana&#x27;s government took office. One of the main issues of Ionatana&#x27;s Government in which Tuilimu served was the country&#x27;s membership of the United Nations, which Tuvalu assumed in this period.

==Acting Prime Minister of Tuvalu==
On the death of Ionatana Ionatana on December 8, 2000 Tuilimu served as acting Prime Minister of Tuvalu, until the election of Faimalaga Luka by parliament on February 24, 2001. His assumption of this office came because he had been the deputy prime minister of Tuvalu on the death of Ionatana. This was the first time that a sitting Prime Minister of Tuvalu had died in office.

==Honours==
Tuilimu was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours for public and community service.

<text>Medieval communes in the European Middle Ages had sworn allegiances of mutual defense (both physical defense and of traditional freedoms) among the citizens of a town or city. These took many forms and varied widely in organization and makeup.

Communes are first recorded in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, thereafter becoming a widespread phenomenon. They had greater development in central-northern Italy, where they became city-states based on partial democracy. At the same time in Germany they became free cities, independent from local nobility.

== Etymology ==
The English and French word &quot;commune&quot; () appears in Latin records in various forms. They come from Medieval Latin , plural form of (that which is common, community, state), substantive noun from (common). Ultimately, the Proto-Indo-European root is &quot;*mey-&quot; (to change, exchange).

When autonomy was won through violent uprising and overthrow, the commune was often called (a conspiracy) ().

== Origins ==
During the 10th century in several parts of Western Europe, peasants began to gravitate towards walled population centers, as advances in agriculture (the three-field system) resulted in greater productivity and intense competition. In central and northern Italy, and in Provence and Septimania, most of the old Roman cities had survived—even if grass grew in their streets—largely as administrative centers for a diocese or for the local representative of a distant kingly or imperial power. In the Low Countries, some new towns were founded upon long-distance trade, where the staple was the woolen cloth-making industry. The sites for these &quot;ab ovo&quot; towns, more often than not, were the fortified &quot;burghs&quot; of counts, bishops or territorial abbots. Such towns were also founded in the Rhineland. Other towns were simply market villages, local centers of exchange.

Such townspeople needed physical protection from lawless nobles and bandits, part of the motivation for gathering behind communal walls, but also strove to establish their &quot;liberties&quot;, the freedom to conduct and regulate their own affairs and security from arbitrary taxation and harassment from the bishop, abbot, or count in whose jurisdiction these obscure and ignoble social outsiders lay. This was a long process of struggling to obtain charters that guaranteed such basics as the right to hold a market. Such charters were often purchased at exorbitant rates, or granted, not by the local power, but by a king or by the emperor, who came to hope to enlist the towns as allies in order to centralize power.

The walled city provided protection from direct assault at the price of corporate interference on the pettiest levels, but once a townsman left the city walls, he (for women scarcely travelled) was at the mercy of often violent and lawless nobles in the countryside. Because much of medieval Europe lacked central authority to provide protection, each city had to provide its own protection for citizens - both inside the city walls, and outside. Thus towns formed communes which were a legal basis for turning the cities into self-governing corporations. In most cases the development of communes was connected with that of the cities. However, there were rural communes, notably in France and England, that formed to protect the common interests of villagers. At their heart, communes were sworn allegiances of mutual defense. When a commune formed, all participating members gathered and swore an oath in a public ceremony, promising to defend each other in times of trouble, and to maintain the peace within the city proper.

The commune movement started in the 10th century, with a few earlier ones like Forlì (possibly 889), and gained strength in the 11th century in northern Italy, which had the most urbanized population of Europe at the time. It then spread in the early 12th century to France, Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The English state was already very centralized, so the communal movement mainly manifested itself in parishes, craftsmen&#x27;s and merchants&#x27; guilds and monasteries. State officialdom expanded in England and France from the 12th century onwards, while the Holy Roman Empire was ruled by communal coalitions of cities, knights, farmer republics, prince-bishops and the large domains of the imperial lords. In eastern Europe, the splintering of Kievan Rus&#x27; allowed the formation of veche communes like the Novgorod Republic (1136-1478) and the Pskov Republic
(1348-1510).

One in four urban communities in France were under the administration of mayors and (Northern France) or consuls and (Southern France) by 1300, and this number increased rapidly in the next 2 centuries due to the financial demands of city wall-building. Many were granted the rights to assembly, and executive power was often concentrated in one elected official, the mayor or first consul, with an advisory body of . Election was often restricted to the wealthy local merchant elite.

In medieval Spain, urban communities were self-governing through their or open council of property-owners. The larger towns delegated authority to (town councillors) and (law officers), who managed the town and the surrounding lands as one &quot;communidad&quot;. After the Middle Ages, selection of officials was changed from election to sortition, in order to resolve factional conflict. In Cantabria, seafaring towns led by Burgos formed the (Marsh brotherhood), an organisation similar to the Hanseatic league. In the 1470s the or Holy Brotherhood was formed, in which all municipalities sent representatives to a which would coordinate law enforcement to protect trade.

== Social order ==
According to Adalberon, society was composed of the three orders: those who fight (the nobles), those who pray (the clergy), and those who work (the peasants). In theory, this was a balance between spiritual and secular peers, with the third order providing labour for the other two. The urban communes were a break in this order. The Church and King both had mixed reactions to communes. On the one hand, they agreed safety and protection from lawless nobles was in everyone&#x27;s best interest. The commune&#x27;s intention was to keep the peace through the threat of revenge, and the Church was sympathetic to the end result of peace.

However, the Church had its own ways to enforce peace, such as the Peace and Truce of God movement, for example. Some communes disrupted the order of medieval society in that the methods the commune used, eye for an eye, violence begets violence, were generally not acceptable to Church or King. There was an idea among some that communes threatened the medieval social order. Only the noble lords were allowed by custom to fight, and ostensibly the merchant townspeople were workers, not warriors. As such, the nobility and the clergy sometimes accepted communes, but other times did not. One of the most famous cases of a commune being suppressed and the resulting defiant urban revolt occurred in the French town of Laon in 1112.

== Rural communes ==

The development of medieval rural communes arose more from a need to collaborate to manage the commons than out of defensive needs. In times of a weak central government, communes typically formed to ensure the safety on the roads through their territory to enable commerce (Landfrieden). One of the more successful of these medieval communities was the one in the alpine valleys north of the Gotthard Pass. This later resulted in the formation of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Swiss had numerous written acts of alliance: for each new canton that joined the confederacy, a new contract was written.

Besides the Swiss , there were similar rural alpine communes in County of Tyrol, but these were destroyed by the House of Habsburg. Other such rural communes developed in the Graubünden, in the French Alps (Republic of the Escartons or Briançonnais), in the Pyrenees, in northern France (Roumare), in northern Germany (Frisia and Dithmarschen), and also in Sweden and Norway. The colonization of the Walser also is related.

Pyrenean villages such as Vicdessos, in common with many other montane communities, enjoyed far greater liberties than those enjoyed in the north of France. The Counts of Foix granted these villages charters recognising their right to governance and both civil and criminal justice administered by their own consuls, and exemption from fees on the use of forests, waters, mines, pastures, mountains, meadows and tolls on trading with other villages. They even successfully won their case against payment of taxes to King Philip IV of France. The Vallée d&#x27;Aspe was another medieval Pyrenean republic, based in Accous and under the suzerainty of the Viscounts of Bearn. The rights of the republic was confirmed by King Louis XIII when he united Bearn to France. These communities thrived in natural isolation and lack of seigneurial interest in interference, particularly in the Western Pyrenees such as the Vallée d&#x27;Aspe (governed by their own &quot;jurats&quot;), Vallée d&#x27;Ossau, as well as the independent legislative assemblies in the Valley of Cauterets, or the Vallée d&#x27;Azun. These communities, called &quot;beziau&quot;, signed treaties with other villages generally meant to govern access to pastures.

Some Southern-European medieval communes were influenced by the Italian precedent, but many northern ones (and even the Swiss communes north of Gotthard Pass) may well have developed concurrently and independently from the Italian ones. Only a few of these medieval rural communes ever attained imperial immediacy, where they would have been subject only to the king or emperor; most still remained subjects of some more or less distant liege.

== Evolution in Italy and decline in Europe ==
During the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged. In most places where communes arose (e.g. France, Britain and Flanders), they were absorbed by monarchical states. But in northern and central Italy, some medieval communes developed into independent and powerful city-states.

The breakaway from their feudal overlords by these communes occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the Investiture Controversy between the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor. Milan led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence (battles of Legnano, 1176, and Parma, 1248). Meanwhile, the republics of Venice, Pisa and Genoa were able to conquer their naval empires on the Mediterranean sea (in 1204 Venice conquered three-eights of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade). Cities such as Florence, Parma, Ferrara, Verona, Padua, Lucca, Siena, Mantua and others were able to create stable states at the expenses of their neighbors, some of which lasted until modern times. In southern Italy, which then formed the Kingdom of Sicily, autonomous communes were rarer, Republic of Sassari in Sardinia being one example.

In the Holy Roman Empire, the emperors always had to face struggles with other powerful players: the land princes on the one hand, but also the cities and communes on the other hand. The emperors thus invariably fought political (not always military) battles to strengthen their position and that of the imperial monarchy. In the Golden Bull of 1356, emperor Charles IV outlawed any , and , meaning in particular the leagues of towns but also the rural communal leagues that had sprung up. Most leagues of towns were subsequently dissolved, sometimes forcibly, and where refounded, their political influence was much reduced. Nevertheless, some of these communes (as Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Hamburg) were able to survive in Germany for centuries and became almost independent city-state vassals to the Holy Roman Emperors (see Free imperial city).

<text>Expo &#x27;98 (1998 Lisbon Specialised Expo) was an official specialised World&#x27;s Fair held in Lisbon, Portugal from Friday, 22 May to Wednesday, 30 September 1998. The theme of the fair was &quot;The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future&quot;, chosen in part to commemorate 500 years of Portuguese discoveries. The Expo received over 10 million visitors in 132 days, while 143 countries and many organizations were represented.

== Before ==
The idea to organize a World&#x27;s Fair in Portugal originated in 1989 between two Portuguese, António Taurino Mega Ferreira and Vasco Graça Moura, who were in charge of organizing the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama&#x27;s arrival in India in 1498.

Once government support was obtained, Ferreira led the bid at the Bureau International des Expositions, which in 1992 declared Lisbon the winner, against the other contender Toronto, Canada. The state-owned company &quot;Parque Expo&quot; was formed to make the Fair a self-sustaining event, with revenue coming from admission tickets and, especially, sales of real estate and parcel lots at the Expo&#x27;s emplacement.

The first Commissioner of Expo &#x27;98 (and Parque Expo&#x27;s CEO) was António Cardoso e Cunha. He was replaced in 1997 by José de Melo Torres Campos, after a general election resulted in a change in government.

The area chosen for the Expo &#x27;98 was a strip that covered in Lisbon&#x27;s east-end alongside the Tagus river. The area had been landscaped in 1942 as a Hydroport, for docking the hydroplanes that crossed the Atlantic to and from the US. When the modern jet planes rendered the hydroplanes obsolete, the place became an industrial park of containers, polluting industries and slaughterhouses which had seen a growing degradation over the decades.

As a result, the Expo &#x27;98 was fully built from scratch. Every building was pre-sold for after-Expo repurposing thus ensuring that, after the expo closed, the site would not be left semi-abandoned, as had happened with previous expos, particularly Seville Expo &#x27;92. As a reminder of the site&#x27;s industrial past, only a refinery tower was kept and repurposed.

To support the expected influx of visitors, an extensive access program was devised, including:
* a new bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge (then the longest in Europe)
* a new line for the Lisbon Metro, with seven stations (five of which were ready for opening day)
* a new main multi-modal terminal, featuring trains, metro, buses, and taxis, called Gare do Oriente, by architect Santiago Calatrava.

== During ==

Expo &#x27;98 opened on 22 May 1998 with 143 countries and 14 international organizations featured in individual pavilions: almost every exhibitor respected the Expo&#x27;s theme &quot;The Oceans: A Heritage for the Future&quot;. There were additional themed pavilions dedicated to Water, Sea Knowledge, Virtual Reality (paid), The Future, Oceans and Oceanophilia; as well as exhibitions: &quot;Leonardo da Vinci@expo98 – La Dinamica dell&#x27;Acqua&quot;, &quot;Roads of the Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Shells and Man&quot;. 
Additional attractions included a 15,000-seater Utopia Pavilion with a resident theatrical show, Camões Theatre, nautical exhibition, Garcia de Orta tropical gardens, Swatch Pavilion, &quot;World of Coca-Cola&quot; exhibition, Expo Adrenalin, 120-metre-tall observation tower (paid), funicular (paid) and the nightly water-show &quot;Acqua Matrix&quot;.

Out of the five major themed pavilions at Lisbon&#x27;s Expo &#x27;98, the Utopia Pavilion was among the most popular. Reflecting the Expo&#x27;s overall theme of &quot;The Oceans: a Heritage for the Future&quot; and designed by the renowned François Confino and Philippe Genty, the pavilion featured a large-scale multimedia show that presented the oceans as stimulators of imagery, taking visitors on a voyage from the creation of the world to the present day. Combining traditional stage technology with highly innovative special effects and mechanical controls, &quot;gsmprjct intégration&quot; handled all of the logistics and technical direction of the project. Housed in a custom-built covered stadium with a seating capacity of 10,000, the show was performed over 500 times, making it the first World&#x27;s Fair show to be seen by over 3 million people.

The Oceania Virtual Reality Pavilion was the biggest hit of Lisbon&#x27;s Expo &#x27;98, attracting over half a million visitors in a four-month period. Even so, the average waiting time for admission was about four hours. It consisted of a virtual submarine voyage to an underwater base where visitors discovered the ruins of a lost civilization and encountered a sea monster before escaping back to the surface in Teleport capsules. Despite being the only pavilion at Expo &#x27;98 that required an additional admission fee, visitors spent hours waiting in line for this breathtaking 30-minute thrill ride that made use of seamlessly integrated simulators, virtual reality visors and interactive projections. gsmprjct° was commissioned to design and produce &quot;Oceania&quot;, planning the look and feel of the overall experience, in addition to acting as project manager, architectural coordinator, and general contractor. Divided into several rooms, the pavilion featured a 45-person simulated submarine ride and 70 mm film, a 3D stereoscopic viewing system with custom content, and custom-designed motion simulators with audio-visual content.

The pavilion of Portugal hosted the Portuguese national representation during the event. It was designed by Álvaro Siza Vieira. The entrance to the building was covered by a large concrete veil, mimicking a paper sheet linking two main buildings and opening a wide urban space.

The total number of visitors of the Expo &#x27;98 reached 10,128,204, for a duration of 132 days. Admission prices (adult) were 5,000 escudos PTE (US$34 at then-exchange rates) for one day, 12,500 escudos ($84) for three non-consecutive days and 50,000 escudos ($334) for three months. The Oceans Pavilion, built to be the Lisbon Oceanarium after the Expo closed, had the longest lines. Other popular pavilions, with lines of up to five hours on busier days, included Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Germany, and Virtual Reality.

=== Logo, Mascot and Music ===

The Expo logo symbolizes the Sea and the Sun. It was conceived by Portuguese Augusto Tavares Dias, creative director in an advertising agency, and selected from 1,288 entries.

The Expo mascot was conceived by the Portuguese duo of painter António Modesto and sculptor Artur Moreira. It was selected from 309 entries. It is named Gil, after Portuguese navigator Gil Eanes. The name was chosen by high school student José Luís Coelho, from 765 entries. Gil turned the RTP mascot and can be see on the station main events.

The official music theme for the Expo &#x27;98 was called &quot;Pangaea&quot; and was written by Nuno Rebelo. It combined chants and instruments from the five continents over an epic full orchestral score.

== After ==

Expo &#x27;98 closed on 30 September 1998. The last day saw more than 300 thousand visitors enter, there to see the closing fireworks show, the largest ever presented in Portugal. The site remained closed until 15 October 1998, when it reopened as &quot;Parque das Nações&quot; (Park of the Nations), a free-access park, keeping the gardens, Oceanarium (Europe&#x27;s then-largest aquarium), observation tower, funicular, and the Virtual Reality pavilion. Other buildings were re-purposed for the opening, including:
* the main entrance (sun door), converted to Centro Vasco da Gama, a regional shopping mall (opened on 27 April 1999)
* the main exhibition pavilions, converted to Feira Internacional de Lisboa (Lisbon International Exhibition Fair)
* Utopia Pavilion, converted to Pavilhão Atlântico (now Meo Arena, after the naming rights were sold to a sponsor), Lisbon&#x27;s main multi-purpose indoor arena
* Knowledge of the Seas Pavilion, converted to Knowledge Pavilion, a hands-on science museum
* Territory Pavilion, converted to a bowling alley, but subsequently demolished
* Future Pavilion, now the Casino Lisboa.

Within Parque das Nações, every other building or vacant parcel lot was sold for office or living space, to offset the Expo&#x27;s costs. The Virtual Reality Pavilion was closed on 31 August 2002 and later demolished. The area today is thriving, modern, stylish, and safe, attracting 18 million tourists a year to its gardens, museums, commercial areas and modern buildings. It has also become permanent residency for up to 25,000 people and one of Lisbon&#x27;s premier business centers, with many multinational corporations basing their headquarters in its main avenue.

Parque Expo had lived beyond Expo &#x27;98, not just managing the infrastructure of Parque das Nações but, having acquired the know-how in urban conversion and planning, sold its advising and consultancy services to other cities around the world. The company was extinct at the end of 2012 and the former territory of the exposition became a new parish of Lisbon municipality.

<text>The grey-winged trumpeter (Psophia crepitans) is a member of a small family of birds, the Psophiidae. It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy==
The grey-winged trumpeter was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under current the binomial name &quot;Psophia crepitans&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the earlier description by the French naturalist Pierre Barrère. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America meridionali&quot; but this is now restricted to Cayenne in French Guiana based on Barrère. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;breaking wind&quot; or &quot;resounding&quot;.

The grey-winged trumpeter&#x27;s taxonomy is unsettled. The International Ornithological Committee (IOC), the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society, and the Clements taxonomy recognise three subspecies:
* &quot;P. c. crepitans&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Venezuela and southeast Colombia through the Guianas and north Brazil
* &quot;P. c. napensis&quot; Sclater, PL &amp; Salvin, 1873 – southeast Colombia to northeast Peru and northwest Brazil
* &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot; Pelzeln, 1857 – central north Brazil

Some authors treat &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot; as a subspecies of the pale-winged trumpeter (&quot;P. leucoptera&quot;) and BirdLife International&#x27;s Handbook of the Birds of the World treats it as a separate species, the ochre-winged trumpeter. In addition, there has been some suggestion that the other two subspecies also warrant treatment as species. This article follows the three-subspecies model.

==Description==

The grey-winged trumpeter is a chicken-like bird with a long neck and legs and a hump-backed profile. It is long. Two males weighed and six females weighed between . The sexes are similar in appearance. Their stout, slightly decurved, bill is yellowish green and their legs and feet greenish olive. Their plumage is mostly black. The nominate subspecies has green or violet iridescence on the lower neck. Its inner wings and rump are ashy gray and the middle of the back is ochre to chestnut. Subspecies &quot;P. c. napensis&quot; has bronzy or purple iridescence, lighter gray wings and rump, and a more ferruginous back. &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot; has entirely ochraceous wings, rump, and middle back.

==Distribution and habitat==

The grey-winged trumpeter is a bird of the northern Amazon Basin. The nominate subspecies is found from southeastern Colombia east through eastern and southern Venezuela and the Guianas and south into Brazil to the Amazon River east of the Rio Negro. &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot; is found in northwestern Brazil north of the Amazon and west of the Rio Negro. &quot;P. c. napensis&quot; is found from southeastern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador into northeastern Peru and east into extreme northwestern Brazil north of the Amazon.

The grey-winged trumpeter inhabits dense lowland tropical rainforest. Within that broad category it favors landscapes away from human habitations and with an open understory and many fruiting trees. Despite being mostly a bird of the lowlands it sometimes can be found in higher elevation cloudforest.

==Behavior==

The grey-winged trumpeter is a gregarious species that lives in flocks of up to about 15 birds of all ages. Each flock maintains a territory that could be as large as about .

===Movement===

The grey-winged trumpeter is entirely non-migratory and tends to move only within the flock&#x27;s territories. It does not cross major rivers.

===Feeding===

Adult grey-winged trumpeters feed mostly on soft fruit that has fallen to the forest floor. Though much of it has been knocked loose or picked and dropped by squirrel monkeys or arboreal birds, it tends to persist so the trumpeters do not need follow monkey troops. Fruits eaten are usually those of large trees but trumpeters will pick fruit from shrubs as well. About 10% of their diet is small arthropods, some of which they capture when following army ant swarms. Chicks are fed a greater percentage of arthropods when young. Adults also eat small vertebrates but only rarely.

===Breeding===

Grey-winged trumpeters are polyandrous and cooperative breeders. Up to three males mate with the dominant female of the flock, and all members contribute to raising the young. The species usually nests in holes in trees that have been excavated by other species, and sometimes also in natural breaks where for instance a trunk has split. They do not build a nest in the hole. They apparently time their breeding so the eggs hatch at the beginning of the local rainy season when fruit, and especially insects, are abundant. The clutch size is two to four eggs but usually three.

===Vocalization===

All trumpeters are highly vocal. The grey-winged trumpeter&#x27;s song is a low humming &quot;wuh-wuh-wuh wuh wuh - -&quot;. Its alarm call is &quot;loud, harsh &#x27;GRAH&#x27; notes&quot;.

==In captivity==

Indigenous peoples tame trumpeters as sentinals because of their predator-spotting ability and loud alarm call; they are also thought to kill snakes.

A captive grey-winged trumpeter named &quot;Trumpy&quot; was kept at Jersey Zoo by the author Gerald Durrell, and was noted for interacting with the people and animals of the zoo. &quot;Trumpy&quot; is mentioned several times in Durrell&#x27;s book &quot;Menagerie Manor&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN follows HBW taxonomy and so assesses the grey-winged and ochre-winged trumpters separately. Both are rated as being of Least Concern. The population size of neither is known but both are believed to be decreasing. The white-winged trumpeter &quot;sensu lato&quot; is heavily hunted. It is frequently trapped by indigenous peoples but does not reproduce in that captivity. Deforestation for timber, ranching, and gold mining is an ongoing threat.

<text>Precious Patrick McKenzie (born 6 June 1936) is a South African-born former Olympic weightlifter and powerlifter who won Commonwealth titles representing both England and New Zealand and has won several world powerlifting and masters world powerlifting titles. He is of diminutive stature at 1.45m (4&#x27; 9&quot;).

He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1974 Birthday Honours for services to weightlifting.

==Career==

Born in Durban, Union of South Africa, Precious McKenzie suffered from ill-health during his childhood. An ambition to be a circus performer ended because of South Africa&#x27;s racist laws and this led him to weight training and weightlifting. Although he was ranked the best weightlifter in his weight category in South Africa, he was barred from representing his country at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games that year because he was classified as &quot;Coloured&quot; under the apartheid regime he was also excluded from the South African team for the 1960 Rome Olympiad. In 1963, he was told he could be included in the South African team for the 1964 Olympics, provided he was segregated from the white members of the team. He refused and left South Africa for Britain in 1964 with his wife and young family. British minister for sport, Denis Howell, fast-tracked his citizenship application to allow him to compete for England in the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Jamaica where he won gold.

Initially working as a clicker in a Northampton shoe factory, he moved to Bristol where he completed a Physical Education degree.

McKenzie competed in three Empire and Commonwealth Games representing England and at three Olympics (1968, 1972 and 1976) representing Britain. As a result of contacts made during the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, he decided to settle in that country, where he was offered the opportunity to be a weight trainer in a gym. He settled in the North Island city of Auckland and won his fourth Commonwealth gold representing New Zealand at the age of 42 at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. He has won more Commonwealth and world medals in his sport than any other person, competing in both the bantam and flyweight divisions.

McKenzie has one of the longest-held world records in sports, (possibly the longest-held current record): 37 years. His 607 kg (1,339 lb) total in the 123 lb class, was achieved in 1979.

He subsequently became a private consultant in the field of back injury prevention and the New Zealand Safety Council&#x27;s Manual Handling Advisor, running courses in New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom and United States.

In 2006, he was recognised by his native country with an induction into the South African Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2008, a film was planned about his life. A New Zealand-based father-son team had a screenplay and sought funding in Cannes. They hoped to start shooting in South Africa by early November 2008. The relationship between McKenzie and the film makers deteriorated and ended in 2012 when McKenzie became disappointed with the slow pace of progress.

== Documentary film ==

*McKenzie was one of nine athletes featured in a National Film Board of Canada documentary on the Edmonton Commonwealth Games, &quot;Going the Distance&quot; (1979).

<doc id="872655" wikidata="Q7651462" url="?curid=872655" title="Suzzallo Library">
<text>Suzzallo Library is the central library of the University of Washington in Seattle, and perhaps the most recognizable building on campus. It is named for Henry Suzzallo, who was president of the University of Washington until he stepped down in 1926, the same year the first phase of the library&#x27;s construction was completed. The library was renamed for him after his death in 1933.

==Architecture==

The library&#x27;s original architects, Charles H. Bebb and Carl F. Gould, called for three structures built in Collegiate Gothic style and arranged in a roughly equilateral triangle with a bell tower in the center. The proposed bell tower, however, was never built. A terra cotta bas relief of this plan, with the bell tower, can still be found on the wall outside the northeast entrance to Smith Hall.
The first phase, completed 1926, built the wing that forms the west face of the triangle. Its façade dominates the eastern side of the university&#x27;s Central Plaza, better known as Red Square. The south wing, the second phase of construction, was completed in 1935. Part of this second phase added a floor between the first and second floors of the original building, and the curving Grand Staircase on either side of what was formerly a rotunda. The original plans for the third wing of the library, completed in 1963, were extensively revised, as by this time the university had largely moved away from its earlier architectural style and had adopted instead modernist concrete and glass forms. A fourth and final addition was completed in 1990 with the wing, named for the father of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen; the elder Allen was an associate director of the university library system from 1960 to 1982. Between the years 2000 and 2002, Suzzallo Library underwent extensive retrofitting to strengthen the structure&#x27;s integrity as a precaution against the effects of an earthquake. It remained open to the public throughout the entire renovation process, although sections were closed for periods of time. While the 2001 Nisqually earthquake occurred during the renovation, the library only sustained minor damage as 60 percent of the interior seismic work was completed when it occurred.

The long, wide, high Graduate Reading Room (illustrated below) features cast-stone ashlar wall blocks and details, and oak bookcases topped with hand-carved friezes of native plants, under a painted and stenciled timber-vaulted ceiling. Tall leaded windows feature 35 foot stained glass panels reproducing Renaissance watermarks. On the oriels at each end of the room, painted world globes bear the names of European explorers. The Graduate Reading Room spans the entire third floor of the west front of the library. Its distinctive look, reminiscent of the great halls of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, is also said to have been inspired by Henry Suzzallo&#x27;s stated belief that universities should be &quot;cathedrals of learning.&quot;

Adorning the exterior of the early wings are terra cotta sculptures by Allen Clark of influential thinkers and artists selected by the faculty. These include Moses, Louis Pasteur, Dante Alighieri, Shakespeare, Plato, Benjamin Franklin, Justinian I, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Herodotus, Adam Smith, Homer, Johann Gutenberg, Ludwig van Beethoven, Charles Darwin and Hugo Grotius. The front façade is also decorated with stone coats of arms from universities around the world, including Toronto, Louvain, Virginia, California, Yale, Heidelberg, Bologna, Oxford, Paris, Harvard, Stanford, Michigan, Uppsala, and Salamanca. Three cast stone figures representing &quot;Thought&quot;, &quot;Inspiration&quot;, and &quot;Mastery&quot; stand above the main entrance.

== Artwork ==
The Allen wing hosts the &quot;Raven Brings Light to this House of Stories&quot; ( in Lushootseed), an installation project by the Washington State Arts Commission, Art in Public Places Program. It is composed of sculpted ravens and crows in the lobby, the &quot;Table of Knowledge&quot; (a cedar table by Ron Hilbert Coy) with a presentation of &quot;International Symposium of Light&quot; (a book printed and bound by Mare Blocker), &quot;Broadsides&quot; (poems by J.T. Stewart) in the lobby and on the 2nd floor, &quot;Study Desks&quot; (two &quot;cawpets&quot; by Carl Chew) on the 1st and 3rd floors of the Allen wing, and a &quot;Things the Crows Left&quot; (a special collection).

==Library collection==
Of the 6 million volumes that make up the University of Washington Libraries collection, approximately 1.6 million are housed in Suzzallo/Allen Library. Along with the Main Collection, Suzzallo/Allen Library also has a Children&#x27;s Literature, Government Publications, Natural Sciences, and Periodicals collections. The Special Collections contains a Rare Book Collection with books printed before 1801. The Microforms/Newspapers collection is the largest collection of microform materials in any Association of Researches Library. Suzzallo Library also houses the main technical services units of the UW Libraries, including the Monographic Services Division and the Serials Services Division.

== In popular culture ==
The Suzzallo Library appears as a recurring setting in the 2018 virtual reality video game &quot;Moss&quot;. Several members of Polyarc, the game&#x27;s developer, graduated from the University of Washington.

<doc id="872661" wikidata="Q16932642" url="?curid=872661" title="1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election">
<text>The Liberal Party of Canada held a leadership election on April 6, 1968. The election was won by Minister of Justice and Attorney General Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who became the new prime minister of Canada as a result. He was the unexpected winner in what was one of the most important leadership conventions in party history. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s newspaper report the next day called it &quot;the most chaotic, confusing, and emotionally draining convention in Canadian political history.&quot;

The convention was held following the announced retirement of Lester B. Pearson, who was a well-respected party leader and prime minister, but who had failed to win a majority government in two attempts. Eight high-profile cabinet ministers entered the race, but by the time the convention began on April 3, the charismatic Trudeau had emerged as the front runner. He was strongly opposed by the party&#x27;s right wing, but this faction was divided between former Minister of Trade and Commerce Robert Winters and Minister of Transport Paul Hellyer and failed to mount a united opposition. Trudeau won the leadership with the support of 51% delegates on the fourth ballot of the convention.

==Pearson retires==

Liberal leader and Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced on December 14, 1967, that he would be retiring in April 1968. Pearson had been Liberal leader since 1958 and prime minister since 1963. He was still much liked by the party and by the Canadian people in general, but had failed to win a majority government in the 1963 and 1965 elections. Liberals were also trailing in the polls behind the Progressive Conservatives, whose popular new leader Robert Stanfield had been selected in September 1967.

Long before the actual convention, a vigorous leadership contest had begun. At the outset, the leading candidates were believed to be Secretary of State for External Affairs Paul Martin, Minister of Transport Paul Hellyer, and Minister of Finance Mitchell Sharp. The unofficial Liberal Party tradition was to alternate between francophone and anglophone leaders, and Jean Marchand was considered a possible candidate. Martin was a highly respected veteran minister who had finished second to Pearson in the 1958 convention, and his ambitions to try again for the top job were well-known. Hellyer was a former Minister of National Defence who had unified the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force into the Canadian Forces.

Marchand declined to run, however, not being interested and suggesting that his English and health were not good enough to be a national leader. It was seen as necessary for national unity and the health of the party to have a strong Quebec candidate. Marchand and Gérard Pelletier united behind Justice Minister Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau had little experience and was not well known nationally, but had earned some renown for his wit and charisma. He had received plaudits for a wide-ranging overhaul of the criminal code that removed many of the morality laws, such as those against sodomy. Trudeau also had the strong support of top Pearson advisor Marc Lalonde as well as the tacit backing of Pearson himself, who felt it was important that a Francophone finish at least second in the race.

==Candidates==
*Pierre Elliot Trudeau, 48, had been Justice Minister since 1967 and Member of Parliament for Mount Royal, Quebec, since 1965. Before entering politics he had been a law professor, writer, and founder and editor of the dissident journal &quot;Cité Libre&quot;.
*Robert Winters, 57, was Minister of Trade and Commerce under Pearson and had been Public Works Minister under Louis St. Laurent. An engineer by training, he had been an MP for Nova Scotia from 1945 until 1957. After several years as a corporate executive he re-entered parliament, representing the Toronto riding of York West since 1965. 
*John Turner, 38, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs since 1967 and previously a Minister without portfolio since 1965, Turner had been MP for St. Lawrence—St. George, Quebec since 1962. 
*Paul Hellyer, 44, had been a Toronto MP since 1949. He served briefly as Associate Minister of National Defence in 1957 in St. Laurent&#x27;s last government, and as Minister of National Defence and then Transport Minister under Pearson. 
*Joe Greene, 47, had been the MP for Renfrew South, Ontario, since 1963 and served as Agriculture Minister under Pearson.
*Allan MacEachen, 46, MP for Inverness—Richmond, Nova Scotia from 1953 to 1958 and again since 1962, served first as Minister of Labour, and then as Health Minister in Pearson&#x27;s cabinet. 
*Paul Martin Sr., 64, MP for Essex East, Ontario since 1935, had first entered Cabinet in 1945 as Secretary of State of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King, served as Minsister of National Health and Welfare under St. Laurent and, since 1963, was Secretary of State for External Affairs under Pearson. He was the runner-up to Pearson in the 1958 leadership convention. 
*Eric Kierans, 54, an economist by training, had been a senior Quebec cabinet minister as Minister of Revenue and then Minister of Health under Quebec Premier Jean Lesage as well as president of the Quebec Liberal Party. 
*Harold Lloyd Henderson, 61, was a Presbyterian minister and the former mayor of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. He had stood in the 1958 Liberal leadership convention where he received a single vote.

==The campaign==
The campaign consisted of trying to win over the almost twenty-four hundred delegates who would go to the April convention. These consisted of prominent Liberals from across the country and also ordinary party members elected by each riding association. The campaign lasted from after the Christmas recess up to the convention. Parliament was in session during this period and since all the major candidates were important cabinet ministers finding time to campaign was difficult. Thus it mostly consisted of the candidates taking short trips to various parts of the country to try to win over delegates.

===Trudeau campaign===
As Trudeau gained more public exposure, his popularity grew. Trudeau is believed to have decided he would run while on holiday in Tahiti over the Christmas break of 1967. The winter of 1968 was dominated by the lead-up to a February constitutional convention, at which Trudeau as justice minister was expected to play an important role. Lalonde, with the approval of Pearson, organized a pre-convention national tour in which Trudeau met with each of the premiers to talk about the constitution, and also to get guaranteed news coverage. One of his most important meetings was with Newfoundland Premier Joey Smallwood, whom Trudeau sufficiently impressed to earn Smallwood&#x27;s lasting support. At the constitutional convention itself, Trudeau made a strong impression by outmanoeuvring and outdebating Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. on national television. Johnson, and many others, felt that French Canadian disaffection could only be addressed by giving Quebec more autonomy. Trudeau rejected this approach, arguing that the best way to protect the interests of French Canadians was to guarantee their rights across Canada. On February 17, only days after this success, Trudeau declared himself as an official candidate for the Liberal leadership.

To the surprise of many, Trudeau became one of the prime contenders. Marchand played a leading role in Trudeau&#x27;s campaign and brought in many supporters, especially in Quebec. Trudeau received endorsements from three cabinet ministers, and two provincial premiers, with Louis Robichaud of New Brunswick joining Smallwood. Trudeau&#x27;s charisma and attention-grabbing behaviour earned him far more media coverage than any other candidate. A Université Laval study found that from January 1 to March 20, Trudeau had received 26% percent of the media coverage devoted to the nine candidates running. Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp was a distant second, with only 16%. Trudeau also received attention outside Canada, being profiled in both the British and American media.

By the end of the campaign, Trudeau was unquestionably the most popular figure among the Canadian public. A public opinion poll gave Trudeau 32% support, Martin 14% and Winters 10%, with the other candidates in single digits. Many within the Liberal Party still had deep doubts about him, however. He was a recent convert, having joined the party only in 1965, and was still considered an outsider. Some saw him as too radical and outspoken a figure and bitterly opposed his views on divorce, abortion and homosexuality. A number of minor scandals also broke out, including one where articles written by Trudeau that were deeply critical of Pearson, especially of the decision to accept nuclear weapons in Canada, were republished. Trudeau was also forced to explain why he had been blacklisted by the United States in the 1950s. His campaign was not run by professional political consultants, instead being directed by a group of young, extremely well educated amateurs such as Gordon Gibson and Jim Davey. The team impressed many, but it also made a number of errors.

===Other candidates===
The race was by no means a sure thing for Trudeau, and a number of potent candidates remained in the contest. Finance Minister Mitchell Sharp was one of the highest-profile cabinet ministers and represented the same liberal wing of the party as Trudeau. His campaign was badly hurt, however, when on February 19 the government was unexpectedly defeated on a tax bill, almost forcing a snap election. Pearson was out of the country, and as senior minister and finance minister getting the bill passed was Sharp&#x27;s responsibility. After this debacle Sharp was prevented from campaigning through much of March by having to deal with a collapse in the world gold market. Though he campaigned intensively in the last few days, internal polling found that Sharp had fewer than 150 delegates and was unlikely to even be able to play kingmaker. The day before the convention, Sharp dropped out of the race and endorsed Trudeau. Sharp brought other ministers with him into the Trudeau camp, including Jean Chrétien, and at least a hundred delegates. The endorsement of the respected elder statesman also reassured many who liked Trudeau but were worried about his radical image.

A number of potent candidates remained in the race, including much of the inner cabinet. Paul Hellyer ran one of the most skilled campaigns, directed by Bill Lee, widely regarded as one of the Liberals&#x27; best campaign managers. The campaign received much attention for using a computer to keep track of delegates. By the convention Hellyer was widely viewed as having the greatest chance to defeat Trudeau. He had several prominent backers including Defence Minister Leo Cadieux and Secretary of State Judy LaMarsh. He drew support from a wide part of the political spectrum and from across the country, but was generally seen as somewhat to the right of Trudeau.

Robert Winters entered the race late, but won strong support representing the right wing of the party. He promised to privatize crown corporations if elected and also was highly critical of Pearson&#x27;s fiscal policy, arguing that the new social programs would damage the Canadian economy. The faction of the party that was deeply worried about Trudeau&#x27;s insurgency hoped for one of Hellyer or Winters to drop out and support the other, but neither would compromise.

Several other prominent ministers remained in the campaign, but were seen as having little chance of victory. The campaign of elder statesman Paul Martin, who had first run for the Liberal leadership in 1958, had slowly faded. Canada seemed in a mood to reject elder statesmen with few new ideas in favour of the fresh new faces. Martin remained in the race, however. Health Minister Allan MacEachen was also floundering and being pressured to drop out in favour of Trudeau, but he too remained. He had a firm base of support in his native Nova Scotia, but was expected to swing his votes to Trudeau after the first ballot. MacEachen ran on a strongly left-wing platform, defending Canada&#x27;s new Medicare system. Agriculture minister Joe Greene was also still in the race and had support in Eastern and Northern Ontario, but was seen as a dark horse. Besides Trudeau, the candidate to garner the most attention for his charisma and oratory was the young junior minister John Turner. He gathered a following, but was viewed as too young and inexperienced to win.

Former Quebec provincial cabinet minister Eric Kierans ran a solid campaign with minimal resources. He developed a small following, but never having been a federal cabinet minister and without a seat in the House of Commons he remained an outsider.

Two fringe candidates also ran. Reverend Lloyd Henderson, a former mayor of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba had received one vote when he ran in the 1958 Liberal leadership convention and had also run unsuccessfully for parliament as an independent in the 1960s. He was not a delegate himself at the 1968 convention and would famously receive no votes even though his wife was a delegate. Ernst Zündel, not yet known publicly as a Holocaust denier, was also a candidate but dropped out before the first ballot after delivering a speech to the convention, decrying what he alleged was discrimination against German-Canadians.

==The convention==

The convention, held at Ottawa, Ontario&#x27;s Civic Centre, took place in the shadow of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots that followed in the United States. The opening day of the convention was dedicated to giving tribute to Pearson, still a much-respected and popular figure, and he gave his parting address to the delegates. The following day consisted of a series of policy workshops. These were based around three halls named Our Life, Our Country, and Our Economy. Each candidate had twenty-five minutes to discuss the topic of the room with delegates. The other candidates noted in alarm that Trudeau drew by far the largest crowds to these events. Friday consisted of speeches by each of the candidates. It was marked by strong speeches by Trudeau, Turner, and surprisingly, Greene. Greene&#x27;s speech focused on his service in the air force during the Second World War and reportedly moved some in the audience to tears. Hellyer&#x27;s address, described as like the reading of a treatise, was poorly received. Hellyer&#x27;s campaign manager, Bill Lee, later reported that the speeches had caused at least a hundred votes to move from Hellyer to Greene.

Outside the convention halls, each candidate&#x27;s team worked to woo delegates. Most of the candidates set up conventional hospitality suites with food and drink for the delegates. Trudeau had nine set up in the various Ottawa hotels, though he did not provide any alcohol. Joe Greene did not have enough money for this, so he gave each delegate Laura Secord chocolates. Allan MacEachen had his own television station, AJM-TV, which broadcast to all the hotels where the delegates were staying; delegates could call in with questions and MacEachen would answer them. The system was plagued with technical difficulties and was not a great success. Hellyer and Trudeau were more successful with publishing a newspaper on each day of the convention, reporting on upcoming events and selling the candidate. Each candidate also had a team of &quot;convention hostesses,&quot; young women dressed in matching uniforms who accompanied the candidate, handed out buttons, and generally tried to build enthusiasm for their candidate.

As with the other conventions of the time, the new leader was decided by runoff voting. Multiple votes were held, and after each round the candidate with the fewest votes was removed from the ballot. This continued until a single candidate won a majority. In the 1968 convention, this process took four ballots and seven and a half hours. The delay was blamed on the new IBM punched card machines that were used to count the votes. Despite instructions not to, a good number of the delegates folded their punched card as they would a normal ballot. These folded ballots caused the machines to repeatedly jam.

The weather was surprisingly warm for that time of year, and, as the convention centre was not well air conditioned, the delegates were left sweltering. Food stands also ran out of supplies early, leaving many delegates hungry. Crowd control was reported as &quot;non-existent&quot;, and even the candidates had to battle their way through the throng to get anywhere. Asked the next day what his first thought was after being elected, Trudeau quipped that it was &quot;how am I ever going to reach the podium&quot;. Outside were several protests, the largest being against the Vietnam War and demanding that Canada stop selling materiel to the United States.

===First ballot===

Trudeau was in first place on the first ballot with about as many votes as expected. Winters and Greene did surprisingly well, creating an unexpected four-way split in the anti-Trudeau vote with Turner and Hellyer. The result was especially disappointing to Hellyer, who had expected to get two hundred more votes than he had.

After the first ballot, Martin, MacEachen, and Kierans withdrew, knowing they could not win. Henderson, who did not get a single vote, was automatically eliminated. Kierans, despite being courted, did not endorse another candidate. Martin&#x27;s tie for fourth ended any chance of victory, or even of playing kingmaker. After speaking with advisors and his son (future prime minister Paul Martin), Martin delivered an emotional withdrawal address that marked the end of his career in politics. Despite earlier discussions with the Hellyer camp, he did not endorse another candidate. Several of Martin&#x27;s supporters, including Herb Gray, moved to support Trudeau. MacEachen withdrew and, as was expected, quickly endorsed Trudeau. However, he did not withdraw in time, and therefore remained listed on the second ballot.

Throughout the voting Trudeau projected an image of what Radwanski referred to as &quot;supreme detachment.&quot; In his booth Trudeau played with the flower in his lapel and ate grapes by tossing them up in the air and catching them in his mouth.

===Second ballot===

Trudeau&#x27;s vote increased on the second ballot. The greatest surprise was Winters, who seemed to be drawing the largest share of the stop-Trudeau votes, with Hellyer unexpectedly falling into third place. Great pressure was exerted on Hellyer, and Turner and Greene, to unite behind Winters. Cabinet minister Judy LaMarsh was famously caught on tape telling Hellyer that &quot;you&#x27;ve got to go to Winters. Don&#x27;t let that bastard win it, Paul—he isn&#x27;t even a Liberal.&quot; Only eight votes behind Winters, and still seeing a chance of victory, Hellyer refused to quit. Turner also stayed unexpectedly and he resolutely refused to deal. Greene was saved from elimination by MacEachen remaining on the ballot, but he promised to endorse Trudeau after the next round. 
Belatedly, Hellyer and Winters agreed that whoever finished third on the next ballot would withdraw and back the other against Trudeau, but most observers felt the time to block Trudeau had passed. Peacock states that it is &quot;fascinating to speculate&quot; what would have happened if Hellyer and Winters had reached an agreement after the second ballot, but he feels that Trudeau most likely would still have won.

===Third ballot===

The third ballot was a close repeat of the second, but Trudeau and Winters began to draw off a substantial number of votes from the candidates who no longer were seen to have had a chance of victory. As per earlier agreements Hellyer and Greene withdrew after this ballot, with Hellyer backing Winters and Greene endorsing Trudeau. To the surprise of many, Turner insisted on remaining on the ballot.

===Final ballot===

Trudeau and Winters won additional support on the final ballot, while Turner, despite having no hope of victory, won almost two hundred votes. Turner&#x27;s delegates would later form the &quot;195 Club,&quot; which would become fundamental in his 1984 run. Trudeau placed 249 votes ahead of Winters on this last ballot with 51% of the vote. With this majority, Trudeau was declared the winner.

===Summary of results===
: MacEachen announced after the first ballot that he was withdrawing and would support Trudeau, but he missed the deadline to remove his name from the ballot.
==Trudeau victorious==

Trudeau won the leadership on the fourth and final ballot, and all the remaining candidates endorsed him. This included both Winters and Hellyer, but observers noted that neither man did so with much enthusiasm. The subsequent Trudeau victory party at the Skyline Hotel swelled to massive proportions as over 5,000 revellers attended and the celebration spilled out into nearby streets.

Trudeau was sworn in as Liberal leader and prime minister two weeks later on April 20. That summer he led the Liberals to victory in the 1968 federal election. Canadians were quickly caught up in the excitement created by this youthful and dynamic leader. His popularity following the convention and through the general election was dubbed &quot;Trudeaumania&quot; by the media; Trudeau was often mobbed by fans, as if he were a rock star.

While Winters announced his support for Trudeau at the convention, he quit politics soon afterward returning to the private sector. He died only a year later. Hellyer briefly became a cabinet minister in the Trudeau government before leaving in 1969, eventually to form his own fringe party, and then seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party. Turner served in Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet, becoming one of the most powerful MPs until quitting in 1975. He eventually returned to politics and succeeded Trudeau in the 1984 Liberal leadership convention. Greene and MacEachen both served Trudeau ably as ministers before being appointed to the Senate of Canada.

The 1968 leadership convention did more than choose a single leader of the Liberal party: it did a great deal to set the history of the party, and of Canada, for the next four decades. Four future prime ministers were at the convention. Trudeau remained leader of the Liberal Party until 1984, and was prime minister for all of that time except during Joe Clark&#x27;s short-lived Conservative government of 1979–1980.

His replacement by Turner in 1984 was largely a product of Turner&#x27;s showing at the 1968 convention. After Winters&#x27; death, Turner&#x27;s third-place showing made him the leading runner-up. Turner&#x27;s political and organizational skills were much lauded in 1968, establishing him as one of the highest-profile Liberals. Turner was succeeded by Jean Chrétien in 1990. Chrétien had originally backed the leadership bid of his mentor, Mitchell Sharp, but joined Trudeau&#x27;s campaign when Sharp withdrew in favour of Trudeau. At the convention, Chrétien became one of the Trudeau team&#x27;s leading figures, playing a crucial role in recruiting a number of other cabinet ministers to the Trudeau fold. Chrétien continued to be Trudeau&#x27;s loyal deputy until Trudeau&#x27;s retirement in 1984. Chrétien would go on to win the Liberal leadership in 1990 and become prime minister in 1993, in part by claiming to be the heir to Trudeau&#x27;s vision and policies. Paul Martin, who would himself become prime minister in 2003, was also at the convention, not as a Liberal operative, but as a close advisor to his father Paul Martin Sr. His father&#x27;s poor showing, permanently ending his long dream of becoming prime minister, has long been cited by biographers as the source of the ceaseless ambition by Martin Jr. to win Canada&#x27;s top job.

<text>Dr. José Antonio Dávila (October 7, 1898 – December 4, 1941) was a postmodern Puerto Rican poet.

== Life and career ==
Dávila (birth name: José Antonio Dávila Morales ) was born and raised in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, into a literary family; he received both his primary and secondary education here and went to high school in Santurce, San Juan.

==Early years==
In 1918, he enrolled in the University of Puerto Rico and later transferred to Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia where he studied medicine, earning his medical degree in 1924; after graduating he established a medical practice there.

He was married to Alma Blake with whom he had a son (José Antonio Dávila, Jr.). Dávila became fatally ill and had to abandon his medical practice. He was interned at the Saranac Lake Hospital in New York, but returned to Puerto Rico in 1930.

Dávila became a poet and received an award from the Puerto Rican Institute of Culture for his poem &quot;Vendimia&quot; (1940). His main source of inspiration was his father, the poet and Mayor of Bayamón, Virgilio Dávila.

== Written works ==
Much of Dávila&#x27;s work was published posthumously. Besides &quot;Vendimia&quot;, his other works are:

* &quot;Los Motivos de Tristan&quot; (&#x27;The Motives of Tristan&#x27;) (1957)
* &quot;Poemas&quot; (Poems) (1964)
* &quot;Almacen de Baratijas&quot;
* &quot;Carta de Recomendación&quot; &quot;Señor: en breve llegará a tu cielo una tímida y dulce viejecita ...&quot;

Davila also wrote a biography of the Bayamonese musician and composer Mariano Feliú Balseiro.

==Death==
Dr José Antonio Dávila died on December 4, 1941, at the age of 43. He was buried next to his father at Cementerio Porta Coeli in his hometown Bayamón, Puerto Rico.

==Commemoration==
The City of Bayamón has named a school and an avenue after him.

<doc id="872675" wikidata="Q902899" url="?curid=872675" title="Halftime show">
<text>A halftime show is a performance given during the brief period between the first and second halves, or the second and third quarters, of a sporting event. Halftime shows are not given for sports with an irregular or indeterminate number of divisions (such as baseball or boxing), or for sports that do not have an extended period of stoppage in play. Ice hockey games consist of three periods, so there are in effect two halftimes at a hockey game: the first intermission is between the first and second periods, and the second intermission comes between the second and third periods. The intermissions are usually given over to contests involving randomly selected audience members, although for major games, like the Winter Classic, the Stanley Cup Finals, the NHL All-Star Game and the Frozen Four, the intermission between the 2nd and 3rd period often features entertainment typically found during halftime shows.

The first instance of a halftime show was in November, 1892 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln when General John J. Pershing required the ROTC band to march drills as a part of their performances. This was first showcased at a football game where the band marched drills at halftime. Since the band&#x27;s military reviews had attracted significant crowds, the goal was to increase attendance at football games by conducting a military review while the team rested between halves. 

Others generally attribute the invention of the halftime show to Walter Lingo. Lingo was the owner of a dog kennel and sponsored an all-Native American football team, the Oorang Indians, to tour the country and promote the kennel. In addition to playing football, the Indians would provide various forms of entertainment, including exhibiting the dogs, players demonstrating their prowess (Nick Lassa once wrestled a bear while Jim Thorpe would kick long-distance field goals), dancing, and demonstrations of native culture. Although the halftime show was in part designed to bring an additional draw to mask the fact that the Indians did not put much effort into the actual game, his halftime show was mostly the same from game to game, and the novelty wore off after two years.

A modern halftime show can consist of cheerleading performances, majorette routines, marching bands playing music, or other spectacular performances. Halftime shows are particularly well known among historically black colleges and universities, which have elaborate &quot;battles of the bands&quot; between the opposing schools&#x27; marching bands during halftimes of the most prominent games (see, for instance, the Bayou Classic). More common in modern times, especially in major games, is to reserve the entire halftime period for a short concert by a major recording artist.

The halftime show also often describes television studio shows during the intermission which review scores and stories from across the league&#x27;s schedule during that break between action.

== Gridiron football ==

A halftime show is a traditional element in an American football and Canadian football game. During the interval between the second and third quarters (normally 20 minutes) some form of entertainment is presented on the field. The entertainment frequently consists of performances by marching bands.

At high school and most college games, the school bands of the two competing teams perform at halftime with the marching band of the visiting team performing first followed by the marching band of the home team. Often, the cheerleaders and/or a dance team will perform. Other activities may also take place, and these vary widely. Until sometime in the early 1980s, these shows were typically included as part of the broadcast if the game was televised; since that time, it has become traditional for TV networks to devote the halftime to a roundup of other games&#x27; scores as well as providing analysis.

During a professional football game, a high school or college band may be brought in to perform. For the Super Bowl and Grey Cup games, an elaborate show involving musicians, dancers, fireworks and other special effects has become the norm. High-profile acts are generally chosen for their broad appeal, due to the games&#x27; large audiences, and choices that deviate from that tend to be poorly received.

Many football historians believe halftime shows originated with the Oorang Indians of the early National Football League. The team was a marketing ploy by Walter Lingo to sell and promote his Airedale Terriers. He would lure audiences to his games with the promise of an outrageous halftime show, instead of the promise of a good football game. The team was called the Indians because they were made up entirely of Native Americans, and Oorang came from Lingo&#x27;s Oorang Kennel Company. The Indians players participated in helping the Oorang Airedales perform tricks for the crowd before and after the game. However, it was their halftime entertainment that made them such a huge attraction in the early 1920s. There were shooting exhibitions with the dogs retrieving the targets. There were Native American dances and tomahawk and knife-throwing demonstrations. Indians player Nick Lassa, also called &quot;Long-Time-Sleep&quot;, even wrestled a bear on occasion. Another show was a demonstration of the United States Indian scouts actions during World War I. The show promoted Lingo&#x27;s kennels by showing the Airedale Red Cross dogs administering first aid to wounded soldiers. Many of the scouts and Red Cross dogs taking part in the event were real veterans of the war, while the German troops were impersonated by local American Legion men who wore German uniforms furnished by Lingo. The halftime activities soon became more important than the results of the game for the Indians fanbase. The Indians only won 3 games in their two seasons of existence.

=== Super Bowl ===

In the United States, the halftime show for the Super Bowl is perhaps the highlight of the event and can cost millions to stage.

On February 1, 2004, the live halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVIII, produced by music video giant MTV, sparked outrage among many viewers when Justin Timberlake, one of the performers, exposed fellow performer Janet Jackson&#x27;s right breast in what was later dubbed a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. Since it was broadcast live, the exposure was seen by millions when it happened.

=== Grey Cup ===

In Canada, the halftime show for the Grey Cup is a highlight of the event and can cost millions to stage. Performers over the years have included Justin Bieber, Shania Twain, Blue Rodeo, Black Eyed Peas, Keith Urban, Green Day and Imagine Dragons.

== Rugby football ==
A halftime show is a traditional element in a Rugby league and Rugby union game during a Grand final.

== Association football ==
Due to the time format and fan nature of association football, halftime shows are quite rare for the sport, although there have been halftime shows in major competitions. 

On September 28, 2024, FIFA announced that Global Citizen would co-produce a halftime show for the 2026 FIFA World Cup final in New York City, the first halftime show in the history of the FIFA World Cup.

<text>An autobike or automatically geared bicycle is a bicycle with a derailleur or internally geared hub (transmission) that shifts gears without intervention from the rider.

== History ==
The CSA Autobike Classic was the first commercially sold autobike and was equipped with a system of centrifugal weights on the rear wheel with a rear derailleur attached to them. When the rider started pedaling it would cause the weights to spin outwards, which shifted the derailleur to a higher gear. When the rider stops pedaling and the bike comes to a stop, the weights would return to the center position, shifting the bike into its lowest gear so it is easier to get started again. The Autobike was featured on several infomercials in the latter half of the 1990s. CSA, the maker of the Autobike, eventually went bankrupt. Also of note was the Trek Lime from the 2000s. It used an internal 3-speed hub gear that was electrically shifted based on the rider&#x27;s speed. Power was provided by a dynamo on the front hub. 

Current autobike designs of the 2020s build on the principles introduced by the Trek Lime. The front wheel uses a hub dynamo to generate electricity. Wires connect the dynamo through the frame to the bottom bracket area where it joins a small onboard computer with sensors that detect the rider&#x27;s speed and cadence. The computer uses this information to actuate a motorized shifter mounted on the rear wheel&#x27;s hub gear to change the gear ratio. The rear hub used is the Nuvinci N360 CVP which is a continuously variable transmission using a planetary gear system.

<doc id="872732" wikidata="Q36856" url="?curid=872732" title="Zwin">
<text>The Zwin is a nature reserve at the North Sea coast, on the Belgian–Dutch border. It consists of the entrance area of a former tidal inlet which during the Middle Ages connected the North Sea with the ports of Sluis and Bruges inland.

The Zwin inlet was formed originally by a storm that broke through the Flemish coast in 1134, creating a tidal channel that reached some 15 km inland and was also connected, through another channel, to the mouth of the Scheldt further north-east. The new waterway offered access to the sea to the inland city of Bruges, which consequently rose to become one of the foremost medieval port cities of Europe. The towns of Damme, Sluis and Sint Anna ter Muiden were also located on the Zwin. However, from the late 13th century onwards, the channel was affected by progressive silting, which from around 1500 caused the waterway to become unusable and cut off the harbour of Bruges from the sea.

The present-day nature reserve was founded in 1952. It has an area of 1.25 square kilometres in Knokke-Heist, Belgium and 0.33 square kilometres in Sluis, Netherlands. It is famous for its large variety in salt-resistant flora, such as sea lavender. It is also popular with bird watchers. There is a small zoo with some major domestic birds and it is one of the few places in Belgium with a population of white storks.

In March 1986 it was declared a Wetland of International Importance.

== Sea battles ==
The Battle of Damme was fought on 30 May and 31 May 1213. The success of the English raids ended the threat of a French invasion of England.

The Battle of Sluys was a sea battle fought on 24 June 1340 as one of the opening conflicts of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France.

During the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Dutch Republic and Spain, the Battle of Sluys on 26 May 1603 was a naval battle in which a Spanish squadron tried to break through a blockade of the Zwin by Dutch ships.

The star schema is an important special case of the snowflake schema, and is more effective for handling simpler queries.

The star schema gets its name from the physical model&#x27;s resemblance to a star shape with a fact table at its center and the dimension tables surrounding it representing the star&#x27;s points.

== Model ==
The star schema separates business process data into facts, which hold the measurable, quantitative data about a business, and dimensions which are descriptive attributes related to fact data. Examples of fact data include sales price, sale quantity, and time, distance, speed and weight measurements. Related dimension attribute examples include product models, product colors, product sizes, geographic locations, and salesperson names.

A star schema that has many dimensions is sometimes called a &quot;centipede schema&quot;. Having dimensions of only a few attributes, while simpler to maintain, results in queries with many table joins and makes the star schema less easy to use.

=== Fact tables===
Fact tables record measurements or metrics for a specific event. 
Fact tables generally consist of numeric values, and foreign keys to dimensional data where descriptive information is kept.
Fact tables are designed to a low level of uniform detail (referred to as &quot;granularity&quot; or &quot;grain&quot;), meaning facts can record events at a very atomic level. This can result in the accumulation of a large number of records in a fact table over time. Fact tables are defined as one of three types:

* Transaction fact tables record facts about a specific event (e.g., sales events)
* Snapshot fact tables record facts at a given point in time (e.g., account details at month end)
* Accumulating snapshot tables record aggregate facts at a given point in time (e.g., total month-to-date sales for a product)

Fact tables are generally assigned a surrogate key to ensure each row can be uniquely identified.
This key is a simple primary key.

=== Dimension tables ===

Dimension tables usually have a relatively small number of records compared to fact tables, but each record may have a very large number of attributes to describe the fact data. Dimensions can define a wide variety of characteristics, but some of the most common attributes defined by dimension tables include:

* Time dimension tables describe time at the lowest level of time granularity for which events are recorded in the star schema
* Geography dimension tables describe location data, such as country, state, or city
* Product dimension tables describe products
* Employee dimension tables describe employees, such as sales people
* Range dimension tables describe ranges of time, dollar values or other measurable quantities to simplify reporting

Dimension tables are generally assigned a surrogate primary key, usually a single-column integer data type, mapped to the combination of dimension attributes that form the natural key.

== Benefits ==
Star schemas are denormalized, meaning the typical rules of normalization applied to transactional relational databases are relaxed during star-schema design and implementation. The benefits of star-schema denormalization are:

* Simpler queries – star-schema join-logic is generally simpler than the join logic required to retrieve data from a highly normalized transactional schema.
* Simplified business reporting logic – when compared to highly normalized schemas, the star schema simplifies common business reporting logic, such as period-over-period and as-of reporting.
* Query performance gains – star schemas can provide performance enhancements for read-only reporting applications when compared to highly normalized schemas.
* Fast aggregations – the simpler queries against a star schema can result in improved performance for aggregation operations.
* Feeding cubes – star schemas are used by all OLAP systems to build proprietary OLAP cubes efficiently; in fact, most major OLAP systems provide a ROLAP mode of operation which can use a star schema directly as a source without building a proprietary cube structure.

== Example ==

Consider a database of sales, perhaps from a store chain, classified by date, store and product. The image of the schema to the right is a star schema version of the sample schema provided in the snowflake schema article.

codice_1 is the fact table and there are three dimension tables codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4.

Each dimension table has a primary key on its codice_5 column, relating to one of the columns (viewed as rows in the example schema) of the codice_1 table&#x27;s three-column (compound) primary key (codice_7, codice_8, codice_9). The non-primary key codice_10 column of the fact table in this example represents a measure or metric that can be used in calculations and analysis. The non-primary key columns of the dimension tables represent additional attributes of the dimensions (such as the codice_11 of the codice_2 dimension).

For example, the following query answers how many TV sets have been sold, for each brand and country, in 1997:

SELECT
 P.Brand,
 S.Country AS Countries,
 SUM(F.Units_Sold)

FROM Fact_Sales F
INNER JOIN Dim_Date D ON (F.Date_Id = D.Id)
INNER JOIN Dim_Store S ON (F.Store_Id = S.Id)
INNER JOIN Dim_Product P ON (F.Product_Id = P.Id)

WHERE D.Year = 1997 AND P.Product_Category = &#x27;tv&#x27;

GROUP BY
 P.Brand,
 S.Country

<doc id="872749" wikidata="Q395414" url="?curid=872749" title="Agoraphobic Nosebleed">
<text>Agoraphobic Nosebleed (abbreviated as ANb) is an American grindcore band. Its line-up has changed often over the years, with guitarist and drum programmer Scott Hull being the only continuous member. The current line-up includes vocalist Jay Randall, Richard Johnson of Enemy Soil and Drugs of Faith, and John Jarvis of Fulgora on bass guitar.

==History==
Agoraphobic Nosebleed formed in 1994 in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States. They are known for rarely playing live, having played at the 2003 New England Metal and Hardcore Festival as an unscheduled appearance. The band Pig Destroyer cut its set short so Agoraphobic Nosebleed could play two songs and an intro. Twelve years later, the band finally played their first full live set at the 2015 edition of the Maryland Deathfest. Their second full live set was played on November 15, 2015, at the Housecore Horror Festival Part III in San Antonio, TX. In keeping with the band&#x27;s aesthetic, no live drummer has been used at the performances.

In 2006, Hydra Head Records reissued Agoraphobic Nosebleed&#x27;s 6&quot; &quot;PCP Torpedo&quot; as a double disc set entitled &quot;PCP Torpedo/ANbRx&quot;. The first disc consists of the 10-song, 6-minute original EP. The second disc is over an hour&#x27;s worth of remixes of songs from &quot;PCP Torpedo&quot; by breakcore and noise music artists such as Xanopticon, James Plotkin, Merzbow, and Justin Broadrick.

In 2009, the band released the album &quot;Agorapocalypse&quot; on Relapse, available as a CD, LP, and longbox CD. The split 7-inch with Crom was released a month later. In 2010, the band released a split 7-inch with The Endless Blockade for Relapse Records and a split 5&quot; with A.N.S. for Tankcrimes Records. A split CD/LP with Despise You was released on Relapse in 2011. The December 2011 issue of &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; included a flexi disc titled &quot;Make a Joyful Noise&quot;, and the December 2012 issue included a flexi disc containing the song &quot;Merry Chrystmeth&quot;.

Agoraphobic Nosebleed is recording four EPs, each written in the preferred style of a specific member. Kat Katz&#x27;s EP, &quot;Arc&quot;, was released in 2016. Randall is currently working on &quot;Drum Machine Gun 2&quot;, as well as doing a collaborative 7-inch with Wadge and a collaborative 12-inch with Black Mayonnaise.

On October 24, 2018, Kat Katz announced their departure from Agoraphobic Nosebleed due to &quot;being bullied by dudes&quot;. The remaining band members denied this, but supported Katz leaving due to irreconcilable differences.

==Musical style==
Agoraphobic Nosebleed is one of the most well-known drum-machine grindcore bands, and has influenced many drum-machine grindcore bands. They are known for the brevity of their songs. The album &quot;Altered States of America&quot; features 100 songs (including one hidden) in just under 22 minutes, with many songs of 5 seconds or less, and the longest song being only 1:45.

<text>A spotlight (or followspot) is a powerful stage lighting instrument which projects a bright beam of light onto a performance space. Spotlights are controlled by a spotlight operator who tracks actors around the stage. Spotlights are most commonly used in concerts, musicals and large-scale presentations in which highlighting a specific mobile individual is critical. Spotlights are sometimes located overhead on catwalks. In some theatres, they may also be located in the control booth or purpose-built &quot;spot booths&quot; in addition to the catwalk.

Spotlights may be arranged in a variety of patterns for coverage. For example, they can be located to the back or rear of a theater and aimed at the stage in front of them. This location can become problematic due to the audience being distracted by fan noise or the spot operator speaking into their headset microphone. In circus and sports, spotlights may be arranged around the facility covering both sides and the ends. In a concert setting, they may be in a front of house (FOH) position, while other positions may have the spotlight upstage used as back or top light. Some concerts use truss spots on a truss downstage, but closer than catwalk spots in an amphitheater-style catwalk layout. In other places, spot locations are at the mercy of the architect who designed the space. 

Characteristics of a typical spotlight include:

* A strong light source, often a high-intensity discharge lamp with a high colour temperature.
* A lens which can be manually focused.
* A manual device to change the intensity of the beam, especially when an HID source which can not be electronically dimmed, is used.
* An &quot;iris&quot; to adjust the size of the spot/angle of the beam.
* A color magazine or &quot;boomerang&quot; consisting of several gel frames which can be swung in front of the beam.
* Some sort of physical sight to assist in aiming is sometimes added onto the lamp by the operator.

Some spotlights can be fitted with colourchangers to colour the beam or gobo holders to create a variety of effects. Most spotlights can be fitted with colour gels.

<text>Distinct society (in ) is a political term especially used during constitutional debate in Canada, in the second half of the 1980s and in the early 1990s, and present in the two failed constitutional amendments, the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord. &quot;Distinct society&quot; refers to the uniqueness of the province of Quebec within Canada, although here the meaning of &quot;unique&quot; is vague and controversial.

==Origin==
Quebec is not explicitly declared distinct in the Constitution of Canada. However, constitutional scholar Peter Hogg argues that several parts of the Constitution already indicate Quebec has distinctiveness that should be reflected in law. Canadian federalism itself, bilingualism in the federal and Quebec legislatures, educational rights, and the acknowledgment of the importance of Roman Catholicism in Quebec were cited as examples.

Experts disagree on whether Quebec is a &quot;distinct society&quot; or &quot;unique culture&quot;, and whether and how to enshrine such status in the Constitution. The term &quot;distinct society&quot; was invented as a description for Quebec by Jean Lesage, the Provincial Premier from 1960 to 1966. In addition to using this terminology, Lesage also advocated that Quebec&#x27;s special status be recognized in the Constitution, which presaged the constitutional amendments later proposed in the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. Lesage did not achieve his desired constitutional amendment as premier.

Quebec was also referred to as a distinct society by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism.

==The Meech Lake Accord==
The Meech Lake Accord, proposed (but never enacted) amendments to the Constitution from 1987 to 1990, would have inserted the phrase &quot;distinct society&quot; into the Constitution Act, 1867 as part of the new section 2 of that Act (the original section 2 of the Act had already been repealed; currently there still is no section 2). In doing so, the Accord would have recognized the difference of Quebec from the rest of Canada, and perhaps implicitly recognized Quebec as a nation. As author Marjorie Bowker wrote, it was primarily a reference to Quebec&#x27;s &quot;laws, its language and its culture.&quot; The National Assembly of Quebec was then referred to in the Accord as having the power to protect Quebec&#x27;s distinctiveness.

It is controversial as to whether Quebec can be referred to as a &quot;nation&quot;, and the use of that word in the official papers of the Accord would have probably doomed its approval in the rest of Canada. However, the &quot;distinct society&quot; euphemism itself seems to have shocked English Canadians, partly leading to the demise of the accord in the other provinces. Some critics, such as the Reform Party of Canada, saw it as granting special status to Quebec, which offended their vision of Canada in which all provinces are equal. Others feared that if the National Assembly was empowered to promote Quebec&#x27;s distinctiveness, a provincial government might decide Quebec must secede in order to keep its distinctiveness.

Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa of the Quebec Liberal Party was a major advocate of the distinct society clause. He regarded it as granting Quebec powers that were vague and thus within the Quebec National Assembly&#x27;s power to help determine; indeed, what makes Quebec distinct could change in the future, and the distinct society clause would still recognize Quebec&#x27;s progress. The Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney of the Conservatives, however, had lower expectations for the legal change it signaled. It was revealed in &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot; that he told Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells that &quot;distinct society&quot; &quot;means dick&quot; (i.e. nothing).

Hogg was also confident the distinct society clause signalled little legal change. As he wrote in 1988, the distinct society clause is &quot;an affirmation of sociological facts with little legal significance.&quot; He believed it was merely a reference to the fact that Quebec is the only province where most Canadians speak French rather than English and that Quebec is the only jurisdiction in Canada that practices civil law rather than common law. The only place in the Accord where he saw Quebec&#x27;s distinct society given real substance was in the other provisions, as Quebec would gain more powers in regard to immigration. Hence, the only way Hogg saw the distinct society clause as having legal effect would be in how to read the rest of the Constitution, although he did not expect that adding a &quot;distinct society&quot; clause would have much practical impact. Rather than giving Quebec powers, he thought, the distinct society clause would recognize that Quebec already has powers that promote distinctiveness (e.g. educational powers), and, just as before the Meech Lake Accord, the use of these powers, even to protect the distinct society of Quebec, would be limited by the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. While the Quebec government could infringe upon a right by saying Quebec&#x27;s distinctiveness is a sufficient reason to do so under Section 1 of the Charter, Section 1 would still demand that the infringement be minimized.

The Accord also recognized that the distinct society clause did not undermine Canada&#x27;s multiculturalism (protected under section 27 of the Charter) or Aboriginal community (protected under section 25 of the Charter and other constitutional provisions).

==The Charlottetown Accord==
The Charlottetown Accord (proposed amendments to the Constitution rejected in 1992) had a so-called &quot;Canada clause&quot; that would have also recognized Quebec as a distinct society. In this Accord, &quot;distinct society&quot; was more clearly defined as including &quot;a French-speaking majority, a unique culture and a civil law tradition&quot;, and the Charter was specified as having to be interpreted with this in mind.

==The 1995 referendum and beyond==
In the run-up to the 1995 Quebec referendum, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien opposed recognition of Quebec&#x27;s distinct society until he reversed himself shortly before the independence vote. However, Ontario Premier Mike Harris refused to support a constitutional amendment on the matter. A House of Commons resolution did endorse recognition of Quebec&#x27;s distinct society. That recognition asked institutions of government &quot;to take note of this recognition and be guided in their conduct accordingly.&quot; 
Since the death of the Meech and Charlottetown accords, the use of the expression has faded, replaced within Quebec with the term &quot;nation&quot; to describe Quebec, its people, and its state. On November 27, 2006, the federal House of Commons also voted to recognize the Québécois as a nation within Canada. As only a motion of the House, it is not legally binding.

==Subsequent events==
In 2021, François Legault&#x27;s Coalition Avenir Québec government in Quebec proposed to amend the Charter of the French Language and the provincial constitution to more strongly entrench French as the sole official language. In response to this, the Bloc Québécois initiated a motion in the House of Commons endorsing the constitutionality of Legault&#x27;s initiatives and reasserting Quebecers&#x27; nationhood. The Commons passed the motion 281–2, with 36 abstentions.

Other euphemisms used mainly by federalist nationalists and federalists outside Quebec are &quot;different&quot; or &quot;unique society&quot;. The Calgary Declaration of 1997, for example, describes Quebec as &quot;unique&quot;.

<text>Francis William Lawvere (; February 9, 1937 – January 23, 2023) was an American mathematician known for his work in category theory, topos theory and the philosophy of mathematics.

==Biography==
Born in Muncie, Indiana, and raised on a farm outside Mathews, Lawvere received his undergraduate degree in mathematics from Indiana University.

Lawvere studied continuum mechanics and kinetic theory as an undergraduate with Clifford Truesdell. He learned of category theory while teaching a course on functional analysis for Truesdell, specifically from a problem in John L. Kelley&#x27;s textbook &quot;General Topology&quot;. 

Lawvere found it a promising framework for simple rigorous axioms for the physical ideas of Truesdell and Walter Noll. Truesdell supported Lawvere&#x27;s application to study further with Samuel Eilenberg, a founder of category theory, at Columbia University in 1960.

Before completing the Ph.D. Lawvere spent a year in Berkeley as an informal student of model theory and set theory, following lectures by Alfred Tarski and Dana Scott. In his first teaching position at Reed College he was instructed to devise courses in calculus and abstract algebra from a foundational perspective. He tried to use the then current axiomatic set theory but found it unworkable for undergraduates, so he instead developed the first axioms for the more relevant composition of mappings of sets. He later streamlined those axioms into the &quot;Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets&quot; (1964), which became an ingredient (the constant case) of elementary topos theory.

Lawvere died on January 23, 2023, in Chapel Hill, N.C., after a long illness at the age of 85.

==Mathematical work==
Lawvere completed his Ph.D. at Columbia in 1963 with Eilenberg. His dissertation introduced the category of categories as a framework for the semantics of algebraic theories. From 1964 to 1967 at the Forschungsinstitut für Mathematik at the ETH in Zürich he worked on the category of categories and was especially influenced by Pierre Gabriel&#x27;s seminars at Oberwolfach on Grothendieck&#x27;s foundation of algebraic geometry. He then taught at the University of Chicago, working with Mac Lane, and at the City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY), working with Alex Heller. Lawvere&#x27;s Chicago lectures on categorical dynamics were a further step toward topos theory and his CUNY lectures on hyperdoctrines advanced categorical logic especially using his 1963 discovery that existential and universal quantifiers can be characterized as special cases of adjoint functors.

Back in Zürich for 1968 and 1969 he proposed elementary (first-order) axioms for toposes generalizing the concept of the Grothendieck topos (see History of topos theory) and worked with the algebraic topologist Myles Tierney to clarify and apply this theory. Tierney discovered major simplifications in the description of Grothendieck &quot;topologies&quot;. Anders Kock later found further simplifications so that a topos can be described as a category with products and equalizers in which the notions of map space and subobject are representable. Lawvere had pointed out that a Grothendieck topology can be entirely described as an endomorphism of the subobject representor, and Tierney showed that the conditions it needs to satisfy are just idempotence and the preservation of finite intersections. These &quot;topologies&quot; are important in both algebraic geometry and model theory because they determine the subtoposes as sheaf-categories.

Dalhousie University in 1969 set up a group of 15 Killam-supported researchers with Lawvere at the head; but in 1971 it terminated the group. Lawvere was controversial for his political opinions, for example, his opposition to the 1970 use of the War Measures Act, and for teaching the history of mathematics without permission. But in 1995 Dalhousie hosted the celebration of 50 years of category theory with Lawvere and Saunders Mac Lane present.

Lawvere ran a seminar in Perugia, Italy (1972–1974) and especially worked on various kinds of enriched category. For example, a metric space can be regarded as an enriched category. From 1974 until his retirement in 2000 he was professor of mathematics at University at Buffalo, often collaborating with Stephen Schanuel. In 1977 he was elected to the Martin professorship in mathematics for five years, which made possible the meeting on &quot;Categories in Continuum Physics&quot; in 1982. Clifford Truesdell participated in that meeting, as did several other researchers in the rational foundations of continuum physics and in the synthetic differential geometry that had evolved from the spatial part of Lawvere&#x27;s categorical dynamics program. Lawvere continued to work on his 50-year quest for a rigorous flexible base for physical ideas, free of unnecessary analytic complications. He was professor emeritus of mathematics and adjunct professor emeritus of philosophy at Buffalo.

== Mathematical work related to physics ==
A central motivation for Lawvere&#x27;s work is the search for a good mathematical (rigorous) foundations of physics, specifically of (classical) continuum mechanics (or at least some kinematical aspects thereof, Lawvere does not seem to mention Hamiltonians, Lagrangians or action functionals).
In an interview (page 8) he recalled:&quot;I had been a student at Indiana University from 1955 to January 1960. I liked experimental physics but did not appreciate the imprecise reasoning in some theoretical courses. So I decided to study mathematics first. Truesdell was at the Mathematics Department but he had a great knowledge in Engineering Physics. He took charge of my education there. ... in 1955 (and subsequently) had advised me on pursuing the study of continuum mechanics and kinetic theory.&quot;

&quot;In Summer 1958, I studied Topological Dynamics with George Whaples, with the agenda of understanding as much as possible in categorical terms. ... Categories would clearly be important for simplifying the foundations of continuum physics. I concluded that I would make category theory a central line of my study.&quot;Then in the same interview (page 11) he said about the early 1960s:&quot;I felt a strong need to learn more set theory and logic from experts in that field, still of course with the aim of clarifying the foundations of category theory and of physics.&quot;The title of the early text &quot;Toposes of laws of motion&quot;, which is often cited as the text introducing synthetic differential geometry, clearly witnesses the origin and motivation of these ideas in classical mechanics.

In an interview, William F. Lawvere reflects on his time as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago in 1967. He mentions that he and Mac Lane co-taught a course on mechanics, which led him to consider the justification of older intuitive methods in geometry, eventually coining the term &quot;synthetic differential geometry&quot; This course was based on Mackey&#x27;s book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, indicating Mackey&#x27;s influence on category theory.

Further in the interview, he discusses the origins of synthetic differential geometry, noting that the idea for the joint course on mechanics came from a suggestion by Chandra. This course was the first in a series, and Mac Lane later gave a talk on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation at the Naval Academy in 1970, which was published in The American Mathematical Monthly. He explains that he began applying Grothendieck topos theory, learned from Gabriel, to simplify the foundations of continuum mechanics, inspired by Truesdell&#x27;s teachings, Noll&#x27;s axiomatizations, and his own efforts in 1958 to categorize topological dynamics.

A more detailed review of these ideas and their relation to physics can be found in the introduction to the book collection &quot;Categories in Continuum Physics&quot;, which is the proceedings of a meeting organized by Lawvere in 1982.

In his 1997 talk &quot;Toposes of Laws of Motion&quot;, Lawvere remarks on the longstanding program of infinitesimal calculus, continuum mechanics, and differential geometry, which aims to reconstruct the world from the infinitely small. He acknowledges the skepticism around this idea but emphasizes its fruitful outcomes over the past 300 years. He believes that recent developments have positioned mathematicians to make this program more explicit, focusing on how continuum physics can be mathematically constructed from &quot;simple ingredients&quot;.

In the same talk, Lawvere mentions that the essential spaces required for functional analysis and physical field theories can be found in any topos with an appropriate object (T).

In his 2000 article &quot;Comments on the Development of Topos Theory&quot;, Lawvere discusses his motivation for simplifying and generalizing Grothendieck&#x27;s concept of a topos. He explains that his interest stemmed from his earlier studies in physics, particularly the foundations of continuum physics as inspired by Truesdell, Noll, and others. He notes that while the mathematical apparatus used in this field is powerful, it often does not fit the phenomena well. Lawvere questions whether the problems and necessary axioms could be stated more directly and clearly, potentially leading to a simpler yet rigorous account. These questions led him to apply the topos method in his 1967 Chicago lectures on categorical dynamics. He realized that further work on the notion of topos was necessary to achieve his goals. His time spent with Berkeley logicians in 1961-62, listening to experts on foundations, also influenced his approach.

Lawvere highlights that several books on simplified topos theory, including the recent and accessible text by MacLane and Moerdijk, along with three excellent books on synthetic differential geometry, provide a solid foundation for further work in functional analysis and the development of continuum physics.

== Mathematical work related to philosophy ==
William Lawvere has also proposed formalizations in category theory, categorical logic and topos theory of concepts which are motivated from philosophy, notably in Georg Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Science of Logic&quot; (see there for more). 

This includes for instance definitions of concepts found there such as objective and subjective logic, abstract general, concrete general, concrete particular, unity of opposites, Aufhebung, being, becoming, space and quantity, cohesion, intensive and extensive quantity ... and so on. 

In his work &quot;Categories of Space and Quantity&quot; from &quot;The Space of Mathematics&quot; (1992), William Lawvere expresses his belief that the technical advancements made by category theorists will significantly benefit dialectical philosophy in the coming decades and century. He argues that these advancements will provide precise mathematical models for age-old philosophical distinctions, such as general versus particular, objective versus subjective, and being versus becoming. He emphasizes that mathematicians need to engage with these philosophical questions to make mathematics and other sciences more accessible and useful. This, he notes, will require philosophers to learn mathematics and mathematicians to learn philosophy. 

A precursor to this undertaking is Hermann Grassmann with his Ausdehnungslehre.

== Political affiliations ==
Lawvere was a committed Marxist-Leninist; for instance, in 1976, he gave a talk called &quot;Applying Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-Thung Thought to Mathematics &amp; Science&quot;. 

According to Anders Kock&#x27;s obituary, in 1971:&quot;[...] The [Dalhousie] university administration refused to renew the contract with [Lawvere], due to his political activities in protesting against the Vietnam war and against the War Measures Act proclaimed by Trudeau, suspending civil liberties under the pretext of danger of terrorism.&quot;As per the obituary on the Communist Party of Canada (Marxist–Leninist) site:&quot;More than 1,000 students rallied in the lobby of the Dal Student Union Building to oppose the arbitrary dismissal of Professor Lawvere.&quot;He saw his political commitments as related to his mathematical work in sometimes surprising and unexpected ways: for instance, here&#x27;s a passage from &quot;Quantifiers and Sheaves&quot; (1970):&quot;When the main contradictions of a thing have been found, the scientific procedure is to summarize them in slogans which one then constantly uses as an ideological weapon for the further development and transformation of the thing. Doing this for &quot;set theory&quot; requires taking account of the experience that the main pairs of opposing tendencies in mathematics take the form of adjoint functors, and frees us of the mathematically irrelevant traces (∈) left behind by the process of accumulating (∪) the power set (P) at each stage of a metaphysical &quot;construction&quot;.&quot;In the earlier sections of the paper, he discusses the &quot;unity of opposites&quot; between logic and geometry. He clarifies that his discussion of contradiction, ideology, and opposition is rooted in the Marxist tradition, referencing Mao&#x27;s &quot;On Contradiction&quot; (1937) in the bibliography. Additionally, he connects various mathematical concepts to Hegel&#x27;s Dialectic and Lenin&#x27;s theory of knowledge in other parts of his work.

<doc id="872767" wikidata="Q790620" url="?curid=872767" title="Avernum">
<text>Avernum is a series of demoware role-playing video games by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software available for Macintosh and Windows-based computers. Several are available for iPad, and were formerly available for Android.

There are six canonical games in the series. The first three games in the series and the non-canon &quot;Blades of Avernum&quot; are remakes of the &quot;Exile&quot; series by Jeff Vogel, who owns the company, collectively entitled &quot;Avernum: First Trilogy&quot;. The next three games (&quot;Avernum: Second Trilogy&quot;), also by Vogel, were released in 2005, 2007 and 2009 respectively. The latter games are entirely original built on a newer game engine and not a remake of any previous game. The &quot;Avernum&quot; games, like other Spiderweb Software games, are designed with gameplay and storytelling before graphical elements. In December 2011, a newer version of Avernum has been released, &quot;&quot;, followed by its sequels &quot;Avernum 2: Crystal Souls&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Avernum 3: Ruined World&quot; in 2018.

==Improvements over &quot;Exile&quot;==
The original &quot;Exile&quot; games used a top-down perspective tile-based graphical system, effectively displayed as an X-Y axis wherein each tile in the grid was filled by a base graphic and perhaps an item or character icon. &quot;Avernum&quot; features a 45-degree axonometric display that appears three-dimensional. The game also adds varying terrain height, allowing for more interesting map layouts.

As the first three games in the series are remakes of the &quot;Exile&quot; series, the primary plot devices remain relatively unchanged, while many new encounters and side-quests are added. With the design overhaul came improvements to the graphical user interface (GUI) and to the storyline as well. Also Avernum has a maximum of four party members instead of six (with a minor exception of two NPCs in Blades of Avernum). In-game art by Phil Foglio lends a more humorous feel to the game.

==Games==

The &quot;Avernum&quot; games take place largely in a subterranean world known as Avernum. The main clash of the game is between the Avernites and the surface kingdom, known as the Empire.

The game features several races. The humans are the dominant race in the series, with the Nephilim and Slithzerikai being two other primary races. Among notable encounters in the game are the Vahnatai, a race of highly magical and alien creatures who live in the deeper caves of Avernum.

The &quot;Avernum&quot; series, similarly to the &quot;Exile&quot; before it, is demoware. The user can download the program for free, and play a significant part of the game without restrictions. The demo ends at a certain point in the storyline, at which time the user must purchase a registration key to continue playing.

===&quot;Avernum: First Trilogy&quot;===
====&quot;Avernum&quot;====
&quot;Avernum&quot;, the first game of the &quot;Avernum&quot; series, features a party of characters thrown from the surface world into the subterranean Avernum. Once here, the player discovers a culture that has formed from the outcasts of the Empire above: a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. In Avernum, adventurers meet with many who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the Avernites.

Besides countless side quests along the way, the game offers three primary quests: killing the demon Grah-Hoth, discovering a route back to the surface, and assassinating Emperor Hawthorne of the surface world.

The game was re-released as &quot;&quot; in December 2011 for OS X and April 2012 for iOS and Windows. This re-released version is the second remake of &quot;Escape from the Pit&quot; and uses a new game engine.

====&quot;Avernum 2&quot;====
&quot;Avernum 2&quot; takes place five years after the events in the original &quot;Avernum&quot;. Upon assassination of Emperor Hawthorne, the Empire of the surface recognizes the threat the Avernites pose and begins sending huge military forces down to Avernum. To make matters worse, unknown barriers of energy are sprouting up around the Avernum, which divides Avernum&#x27;s forces, making them weaker.

The player controls a party of characters that meets one of the Vahnatai creatures responsible for the barriers in Avernum, and travels to meet with their leaders to negotiate. The party finds out that the reason of the hostility is the theft of the crystal souls by the Empire. The party retrieves the crystal souls, and in turn the Vahnatai join the Avernites in opposition against the Empire. With their support, the Avernites turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repel the invasion.

Starting &quot;Avernum 2&quot; player may choose to have Nephilim and Slithzerikai characters in the party, in contrast to the original &quot;Avernum&quot; that allowed only human characters.

====&quot;Avernum 3&quot;====
&quot;Avernum 3&quot; takes place ten years after the events of &quot;Avernum 2&quot;. Avernites have done a lot of preparation and are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. After those selected few vanish, they send a selected few more. While those who emerge are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they also begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes encountered are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste. When scouting the land, as per orders from the Avernite government, the player is asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. Adventurers must bring the Avernites and the Empire together to find the cause of the destruction.

===&quot;Blades of Avernum&quot;===
&quot;Blades of Avernum&quot; is a non-canon installment in the &quot;Avernum&quot; series, released in June 2004. It comes with four pre-installed scenarios, three of which are only available after game purchase. Its most notable feature is a free scenario creation kit that can be downloaded and used to make scenarios that can be distributed to other players. It has come under fire for being &quot;too complex&quot; in comparison to &quot;Blades of Exile&quot;, its predecessor, which used a very simple instruction list instead of a script system. On the other hand, it has also been praised for allowing many new possibilities using said script system, which couldn&#x27;t be achieved with the &quot;Blades of Exile&quot; system.

Spiderweb Software has released the source code for the editor and allows others to make enhanced versions and add-ons, which a number of players have done. The most notable adaptation of the editor is a 3D editor, which allows the user to view and edit a project using axonometric in-game view.

===&quot;Avernum: Second Trilogy&quot;===

====&quot;Avernum 4&quot;====
&quot;Avernum 4&quot; was released for Macintosh in late 2005 and released for Windows on March 2, 2006. It makes use of the Geneforge engine and merges it with the &quot;Avernum&quot; engine; essentially this means that the gameplay is entirely turn-based, but uses the &quot;Geneforge&quot; point-and-click navigation and user interfaces. In addition, there is a large amount of new art in order to bring the world of Avernum to life within the reworked &quot;Geneforge&quot; engine.

&quot;Avernum 4&quot; takes place long after the other games – one of the dialogue options remarks that the events of the third game happened &quot;before we were even born&quot;. Weird monsters have been appearing in the underworld, and three powerful shades have been attacking people in the cities. A group of assassins also appears and targets all travellers and especially player characters. The player takes charge of a group of heroes which will, in the end, determine the fate of all of Avernum.

====&quot;Avernum 5&quot;====

On November 12, 2007 Spiderweb Software released &quot;Avernum 5&quot; for Macintosh, followed by the Windows version on February 16, 2008. The game utilizes the same game engine as its predecessor, but differs greatly in its plot element. Instead of being hired by Avernum (as with all other chapters in the series), the party of adventurers in the story fulfill the bidding of the Empire. The player controlling the party must hunt down the assassin Dorikas while dealing with numerous other obstacles such as spies and betrayal. Meanwhile, characters in the party are trained in over fifty spells and battle disciplines. Battle disciplines are applied on an axonometric game grid sharing an interface with &quot;Avernum 4&quot;.

====&quot;Avernum 6&quot;====
&quot;Avernum 6&quot; was released late 2009 for the Macintosh and early March 2010 for Windows and was developed on a low budget. In the time since the last game, Avernum has been struck by several disasters. The mushrooms which provide most of Avernum&#x27;s food have been infected with a disease causing them to become poisonous and die, and the Slithzerikai horde has attacked. The player controls a group of Avernite soldiers whose job is to save Avernum.

==Rebooted Series==

In 2011, the series was rebooted with &quot;Avernum: Escape from the Pit&quot;, which follows the same plot (and whose title is a portmanteau of) &quot;Avernum&quot; and &quot;Exile: Escape from the Pit&quot;, but features a greatly enhanced game engine and an expanded storyline.

===&quot;Avernum 2: Crystal Souls&quot;===

In 2015, following the reboot of the first game, the second game was rebooted, based on the same plot and title of &quot;Avernum 2&quot; and &quot;Exile II: Crystal Souls&quot;. Once again it consists of game engine enhancements and additional plot elements.

===&quot;Avernum 3: Ruined World&quot;===

The third rebooted game, based on the same plot and title of &quot;Avernum 3&quot; and &quot;Exile III: Ruined World&quot; was released on January 31, 2018.

==Reception==
The original titles in the &quot;Avernum&quot; series have frequently been met with praise for the depth of their storytelling and gameplay, while simultaneously receiving criticism for the use of crude graphics and game engines and lack of better sound effects.

Although &quot;Avernum&quot; is an indie game, it is nevertheless compared to games released by publishers. A review of the original &quot;Avernum&quot; in July 2000 noted that it was &quot;not even in the same league as current RPG/RTS products [in] the market&quot;. Newer games in the series, however, were praised for having much higher production values.

Several years later, in August 2002, the Just RPG review of sequel &quot;Avernum 3&quot; reached a completely different conclusion. Scoring the game as an 88%, the review concluded, &quot;Bottom line? Graphics don&#x27;t make the game. Despite lack of animation and 32-bit graphics, this is a top-notch RPG that I would love to see more of in today&#x27;s market.&quot;

The latter games in the series received more positive reviews. A June 2006 review at Game Tunnel for &quot;Avernum 4&quot; commented that &quot;lots of thought [was] given to the environment and background story, and the game itself seems very solid.&quot;

Reaction to the final game of the original series, &quot;Avernum 6&quot;, was reasonably positive and praised the storyline. IndieRPGs.com said it was &quot;a game that lives and dies by the strength of its writing, and the writing is pretty good&quot;, while noting that &quot;it lacks a certain level of polish&quot;. IT Reviews commented, &quot;As long as you can get past the aesthetics, Avernum 6 is a compelling slice of old school role-playing, which is well designed on the character development and combat fronts.&quot; It was also nominated and became the runner-up on &quot;Independent RPG of the Year&quot; by GameBanshee.

The games have received very varying scores throughout the series, often the tipping point being the &quot;inadequate&quot; graphics. However, most reviews admitted to good storytelling and well-presented RPG gameplay elements, noting that the game is recognisable for its gameplay value.

The Avernum series was rebooted in early 2010s, and the ground-up rewrites &quot;&quot; and &quot;Avernum 2: Crystal Souls&quot; have received a largely positive critical reception. For example, GameBanshee wrote, &quot;Fans looking to get into the Avernum series will do very well with &quot;Escape from the Pit&quot;, and while the improvements beyond the game engine and visuals are relatively modest, there&#x27;s still a lot to enjoy even if you&#x27;ve played through the game once before already.&quot;

<doc id="872768" wikidata="Q1395551" url="?curid=872768" title="Rose West">
<text>Rosemary Pauline West (née Letts; born 29 November 1953) is an English serial killer who collaborated with her husband, Fred West, in the torture and murder of at least nine young women between 1973 and 1987; she also murdered her eight-year-old stepdaughter Charmaine in 1971. The majority of these murders took place at the West residence in Gloucester.

West is currently an inmate at HM Prison New Hall, Flockton, West Yorkshire, after being convicted in 1995 of ten murders. Fred West died by suicide in prison that same year while awaiting trial, following the couple&#x27;s arrest in 1994.

==Early life==
Rose West was born Rosemary Pauline Letts in Northam, Devon, to William Andrew &quot;Bill&quot; Letts and Daisy Gwendoline Fuller after a difficult pregnancy. She was the fifth of seven children born into a poor family. Rose&#x27;s mother suffered from depression and was given electroconvulsive therapy both during and immediately after her pregnancy; some have argued that this treatment may have caused prenatal developmental injuries to her daughter.

Rose grew up into a moody teenager, prone to daydreaming and performing poorly at school. After her parents separated she initially lived with her mother and attended Cleeve School for six months, then moved in with her father in Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Letts&#x27;s father, who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, was prone to extreme violence and repeatedly sexually abused Letts and her oldest sister Patricia.

At the onset of puberty, Letts, reportedly fascinated by her developing body, would deliberately parade naked or semi-naked around the house in the presence of her younger brother, Graham (born 1957). On numerous occasions, at the age of 13, she would also creep into nine-year-old Graham&#x27;s bed at nightfall and molest him and her youngest brother Gordon.

==Meeting Fred West==

Rose first encountered Fred West at a Cheltenham bus stop in early 1969, shortly after Rose had turned 15 and when Fred was aged 27. Initially Rose was repulsed by Fred&#x27;s unkempt appearance, but quickly became flattered by the attention he continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred but allowed him to accompany her home.

Having discovered Rose worked in a nearby bread shop, Fred persuaded an unknown woman to enter the premises and present her with a gift accompanied by the explanation that a &quot;man outside&quot; had asked her to present this gift to her. Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening, an offer she accepted. Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the caravan park where he lived with the two children from his first marriage to Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; Costello, daughter Anne Marie and stepdaughter Charmaine. Rose became a willing childminder to Fred&#x27;s daughters, who she noted were neglected and whom she initially treated with care and affection. On several occasions in the early days of their courtship, Rose insisted she and Fred take the girls on excursions to gather wildflowers.

Within weeks of her first meeting Fred, Rose left her job at the bread shop in order to become a full-time nanny to Fred&#x27;s children; this decision was made with the agreement that Fred would provide her with sufficient money to give to her parents on Fridays to convince them she was still obtaining a salary at the bread shop. Several months later, Rose introduced Fred to her family, who were aghast at their daughter&#x27;s choice of partner. Rose&#x27;s mother was unimpressed with Fred&#x27;s boastful and arrogant behaviour, and correctly concluded he was a pathological liar. Her father vehemently disapproved of the relationship, threatening Fred directly and promising to call social services if he continued to associate with his daughter.

===Relationship===
Rose&#x27;s parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was having a sexual relationship with an older man and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at Fred&#x27;s caravan. In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969, and only permitted to leave under controlled conditions. When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred.

On her 16th birthday, Rose left the home for troubled teenagers to return to her parents while Fred was serving a thirty-day sentence for theft and unpaid fines. Upon his release, Rose left her parents&#x27; home to move into the Cheltenham flat he then lived in. Shortly thereafter, Fred collected Charmaine and Anne Marie from social services. Rose&#x27;s father made one final effort to prevent his daughter from seeing Fred, and Rose was examined by a police surgeon in February 1970, who confirmed she was pregnant. In response, Rose was again placed into care but was discharged on 6 March on the understanding she would terminate her pregnancy and return to her family. Instead, Rose opted to live with Fred, resulting in her father forbidding his daughter from ever again setting foot in his household.

Three months later, the couple vacated the Cheltenham flat and relocated to the ground floor flat of a two-storey house at Midland Road in Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (speculation remains that Heather may have been sired by Rose&#x27;s own father). Two months later, Fred was imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle tax disc. He remained imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with Charmaine and Anne Marie being told to refer to Rose as their mother.

According to Anne Marie, she and Charmaine were frequently subjected to extensive physical and emotional abuse throughout the time they lived under Rose&#x27;s care at Midland Road. Although Anne Marie was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in response to the abuse, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude, no matter how severely she was treated. Despite the years of neglect and abuse, Charmaine&#x27;s spirit had not been broken and she talked wistfully to Anne Marie of the belief she held that her &quot;mummy will come and save me&quot;. Anne Marie later recollected her sister repeatedly antagonised Rose by making statements such as: &quot;My real mummy wouldn&#x27;t swear or shout at us&quot; in response to Rose&#x27;s scathing language.

A childhood friend of Charmaine&#x27;s named Tracey Giles, who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road, would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests&#x27; flat unannounced only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Giles, Charmaine had been &quot;calm and unconcerned&quot;, while Anne Marie had been standing by the door with a blank expression on her face.

Hospital records reveal Charmaine had received treatment for a severe puncture wound to her left ankle in the casualty unit of the Gloucester Royal Hospital on 28 March 1971. This incident was explained by Rose to have resulted from a household accident.

===Murder of Charmaine West===
Rose is believed to have murdered Charmaine shortly before Fred&#x27;s prison release date of 24 June 1971. She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anne Marie, and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June; it is believed Charmaine was killed on or very shortly after this date. As well as forensic odontology confirming that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Tracey Giles&#x27;s mother, Shirley, corroborated the fact that Charmaine had died before Fred&#x27;s release. In her later testimony at Rose&#x27;s trial, Shirley stated that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anne Marie when her family lived in the upper flat of 25 Midland Road in 1971. Shirley further stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat in April 1971, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine on one day in June, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: &quot;She&#x27;s gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!&quot;

As with the Giles family, Rose explained Charmaine&#x27;s disappearance to others who enquired about her whereabouts by claiming that Fred&#x27;s first wife, Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; West, had taken her eldest daughter to live with her in Bristol. She informed staff at Charmaine&#x27;s primary school that the child had moved with her mother to London. When Fred was released from prison on 24 June, he allayed Anne Marie&#x27;s concerns for her sister&#x27;s whereabouts by claiming her mother Rena had collected Charmaine and returned to her native Scotland. In her autobiography, &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;, Anne Mariewho was fully white while Charmaine was of part-Asian ethnicityrecollects that when she asked why her mother had collected Charmaine but not her, Fred callously replied: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t want you, love. You&#x27;re the wrong colour.&quot;

Charmaine&#x27;s body was initially stowed in the coal cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He later buried her naked body in the yard close to the back door of the flat, and he remained adamant he had not dismembered her. A subsequent post-mortem suggested the body had been severed at the hip; this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976. Several bonesparticularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle boneswere missing from Charmaine&#x27;s skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes. This would prove to be a distinctive finding in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994.

===Murder of Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; West===
Rena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated. She is also known to have visited Fred&#x27;s family in Much Marcle, Herefordshire, to enquire as to her children&#x27;s whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971. Fred&#x27;s sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was depressed and extremely anxious about her children. Being provided with Fred&#x27;s Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront himlikely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the last time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred&#x27;s Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated. When Rena&#x27;s body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving open a possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. The body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags and buried close to a cluster of trees, known as Yewtree Coppice, at Letterbox Field.

==Marriage==
On 29 January 1972, Fred and Rose married. The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred falsely describing himself as a bachelor on the marriage certificate. No family or friends were invited.

Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street. Initially the three-storey home, located close to Gloucester city centre, was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for £7,000 (). To facilitate the Wests&#x27; purchase, many of the upper-floor rooms were initially converted into bedsits to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where his family lived. Only Fred and his family were permitted access to the back garden of the property.

On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter. The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June.

===Prostitution===
Shortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at Cromwell Street and advertising her services in a local contact magazine. Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester&#x27;s West Indian community through these advertisements. In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in casual sex with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her. When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner, with acts such as partially suffocating her partner or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner&#x27;s body. If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: &quot;Aren&#x27;t you woman enough to take it?&quot;

To many of these women, it became apparent Rose and her husband (who regularly participated in threesomes with his wife and her lovers) took a particular pleasure from taking women beyond their sexual limitstypically via sessions involving bondage. The Wests openly admitted to taking a particular pleasure from any form of sex involving a strong measure of dominance, pain and violence. To cater to these fetishes, they amassed a large collection of bondage and restraining devices, magazines and photographs, later expanding this collection to include videos depicting bestiality and graphic sexual abuse of children.

Rose controlled the West family finances and Fred gave her his pay packets. The room Rose used for prostitution was known throughout the household as &quot;Mandy&#x27;s Room&quot; (Mandy being the working name Rose used when she was with her clients), and had several hidden peepholes allowing Freda longtime voyeurto watch her entertain her clients. Fred also installed a baby monitor in the room, allowing him to listen from elsewhere in the house. The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose was not to be disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room around her neck, and Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which her clients were instructed to ring whenever they visited. Much of the money earned from Rose&#x27;s prostitution was spent on home improvements.

By 1977, Rose&#x27;s father Bill had come to tolerate his daughter&#x27;s marriage, and to develop a grudging respect for Fred. Together, he and Fred opened a café they named The Green Lantern, which was soon insolvent. Bill was also known to visit Cromwell Street to solicit his daughter&#x27;s services. By 1983, Rose had given birth to eight children, at least three of whom had been conceived by clients. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own and falsely informed them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his great-grandmother was a black woman.

===Domestic violence===
When each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishmentalmost always physicalbeing the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. The children feared being the recipients of violence from both parents, but Rose inflicted the vast majority of the abuse. The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose&#x27;s gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children&#x27;s faces or hands in these assaults.

First Heather, and then her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), both ran away from home; they returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends; they were each beaten upon their return. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the casualty units of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.

On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping the kitchen floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using. In response, Rose hit the boy over the head with the bowl, then repeatedly kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: &quot;You did that on purpose, you little swine!&quot; On another occasion, Rose became furious about a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting abrasions to Mae June&#x27;s chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae screamed, &quot;No, Mum! No, Mum!&quot; as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing.

On one occasion in August 1974, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand; Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose lunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and three of Rose&#x27;s fingers slipping down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: &quot;Look what you done, fella. You&#x27;ve got to take me to the hospital now.&quot;

==Initial sexual assaults==
===Anne Marie West===
In September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anne Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street. The child was ordered to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child&#x27;s hesitation. She was then stripped naked, bound to a mattress and gagged before Fred raped her with Rose&#x27;s active encouragement. After the rape, Rose explained to the child: &quot;Everybody does it to every girl. It&#x27;s a father&#x27;s job. Don&#x27;t worry, and don&#x27;t say anything to anybody.&quot; Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands.

Rose occasionally sexually abused Anne Marie herself, and later took extreme gratification in degrading her with acts such as binding her to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, or forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. Fred and Rose forced Anne Marie into prostitution from the age of 13, telling clients she was aged 16. Rose was always present in the room when these acts occurred to ensure the girl did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anne Marie was aged 13 or 14, Rose took her to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anne Marie. Once they had left the premises, Anne Marie was bundled into her father&#x27;s van and beaten by Rose, who asked her: &quot;Do you think you could be my friend?&quot; before she was sexually abused by her father and stepmother.

===Caroline Owens===
In October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children&#x27;s nanny. They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she hitchhiked from Tewkesbury to her home in Cinderford, having visited her boyfriend. Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, Fred and Rose offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday. Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street and shared a room with Anne Marie, whom Owens noted was &quot;very withdrawn&quot;.

Rose, who had begun to engage in prostitution by this time, explained to Owens that she worked as a masseuse when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her. When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests&#x27; overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.

Knowing Owens&#x27;s habits of hitchhiking along the A40 between Cinderford and Tewkesbury, the Wests formulated a plan to abduct her for their shared gratification. Fred later admitted that the specific intent of this abduction was the rape and likely murder of Owens, but that his initial incentive was to determine whether his wife would be willing to at least assist him in an abduction. On 6 December 1972, the couple lured Owens into their vehicle with an apology for their previous conduct and the offer of a lift home. Initially, Owens believed the Wests had been sincere in their apologies and obliged, believing she had simply mistaken their earlier intentions. Rose joined her in the back seat, with the explanation she wanted a &quot;girls&#x27; chat&quot; as Fred drove.

Shortly thereafter, Rose began to fondle Owens, as Fred questioned whether she had had sex with her boyfriend that evening. When Owens began to protest, Fred stopped the car, referred to Owens as a &quot;bitch&quot; and punched her into unconsciousness before he and Rose bound and gagged her with a scarf and duct tape. In her subsequent statement to police, Owens stated that, at Cromwell Street, she was given a drugged cup of tea to drink before being again gagged and subjected to a prolonged sexual assault from the Wests. When Owens screamed, Rose smothered her with a pillow, further restrained her about the neck and performed cunnilingus on her. Realising the gravity of her situation, Owens ceased resisting their sexual assaults.

The following morning, having noted Owens&#x27; screaming when one of his children had knocked on the door of the room in which she was restrained, Fred threatened that he and his wife would keep her locked in the cellar and allow his &quot;black friends&quot; to abuse her, and that when they had finished he would bury her body beneath &quot;the paving stones of Gloucester&quot;. Fred then claimed he had killed hundreds of young girls, adding that Owens had primarily been brought to the house for &quot;Rose&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. He and Rose then calmly asked Owens whether she would consider returning to work as their nanny. Seeing her escape avenue, Owens agreed and vacuumed the house to indicate her belief in becoming an extended member of the family. Later that day, Owens escaped from a launderette she and Rose had entered and returned home. Although initially too ashamed to divulge what had happened, when her mother noted the welts, bruises and exposed subcutaneous tissues on her daughter&#x27;s body, Owens burst into tears and confided her ordeal.

Owens&#x27; mother immediately reported her daughter&#x27;s story to the police, and the Wests were arrested and charged with assault, indecent assault, actual bodily harm and rape. The case was tried at Gloucester Magistrates Court on 12 January 1973, but by this date Owens had decided she could not face the ordeal of giving testimony. All charges pertaining to her ordeal were dropped, and the Wests agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charges of indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm; each was fined £50 (equivalent to £619 in 2024), and the couple were allowed to walk free. When Owens heard this news, she attempted suicide.

==Investigation and arrest==
On 6 August 1992, Fred was arrested after being accused of raping his 13-year-old daughter three times and Rose was arrested for child cruelty. This case against them collapsed on 7 June 1993 when their daughter refused to testify in court. All five of the Wests&#x27; younger children were removed from their custody to foster homes. This case brought to light the disappearance of Heather, who had not been seen since 1987 and triggered the major investigation that followed.

After police found human remains and apparent signs of torture at 25 Cromwell Street, Rose, along with Fred, was arrested in February 1994. During her trial, Rose denied murdering any of the victims and insisted that her husband had committed the criminal acts alone. She also claimed to have tried to stop one of the sexual assaults her husband committed. Rose continued to profess ignorance of her husband&#x27;s activities, but the circumstantial evidence that mounted against the couple was considered sufficient to prosecute her for ten murders: those of the young women whose bodies were found at Cromwell Street, and of Charmaine West. Fred was charged with two further murders committed before his association with Rose.

After his arrest in February 1994, Fred confided to his appropriate adult, Janet Leach, that Rose had murdered Shirley Robinson and had assisted in her dismemberment, personally removing Robinson&#x27;s foetus from the womb in the process. Found under the patio at Cromwell Street was the body of the Wests&#x27; daughter, Heather, who was murdered in June 1987 after being abused by her parents all her life. It is said that Heather began to tell her friends about the abuse occurring in her home. Barry, her younger brother, would later describe watching, as a seven-year-old, his mother kick Heather repeatedly about the head until she was no longer moving. The Wests told friends and concerned parties that she had left home to work at a Devonshire holiday village and on one occasion fabricated a phone call, supposedly from Heather, to allay her siblings&#x27; suspicions regarding her disappearance. Fred would even taunt his children when they misbehaved by jokingly stating, &quot;If you don&#x27;t behave, you&#x27;ll end up under the patio like Heather.&quot; This was the last known murder that the pair committed.

While on remand at HM Prison Birmingham, Fred killed himself by hanging on 1 January 1995.

==Trial==
At pretrial proceedings in February 1995, Rose pleaded not guilty to ten charges of murder (the murder of Charmaine having been added to the original nine after Fred&#x27;s suicide, and two counts of rape and indecent assault of young girls having been dropped with a view for later resubmission) though her counsel conceded that circumstantial evidence indicated Rose&#x27;s willingness to subject young girls to sadistic physical and sexual abuse. Her trial at Winchester Crown Court began on 3 October 1995, with Mr Justice Mantell and a jury. An important early decision by the judge was to admit testimony related to the sexual assault of three women by Fred and Rose, accepting the prosecution&#x27;s argument that it established a pattern of behaviour repeated in the murders.

===Prosecution===
In his opening statement, prosecutor Brian Leveson portrayed the Wests as sadistic sex-obsessed murderers, terming the bodies discovered at Cromwell Street and Midland Road &quot;more terrible than words can express&quot;; &quot;[The victims&#x27;] last moments on earth were as objects of the sexual depravity of this woman and her husband&quot;. He pointed out that Fred had been incarcerated when Charmaine was killed; claimed that Fred and Rose had each learned from their mistake in allowing Caroline Owens to live; and said that the gag on victim Thérèse Siegenthaler evinced a &quot;feminine&quot; toucha scarf tied in a bow. Leveson promised to demonstrate Rose&#x27;s controlling and sexually sadistic character, as well as her efforts to deflect suspicion about the disappearance of their victims.

Prosecution witnesses included Cromwell Street lodgers; victims&#x27; relatives; Rose&#x27;s mother Daisy and sister Glenys; and surviving victims including Anne Marie West, Kathryn Halliday (a former lover of Fred and Rose), Caroline Owens and a &quot;Miss A&quot; (who had been sexually assaulted at age 14 by Fred and Rose in 1977, and who described Rose as the more aggressive perpetrator of the two). Neighbours described Charmaine&#x27;s 1971 disappearance while Fred was imprisoned, and Rose&#x27;s casual indifference to Heather&#x27;s disappearance. Rose&#x27;s counsel, Dick Ferguson, tried to discredit prosecution witnesses as either having financially exploited their connection to the case or motivated by grudges. Owens, though admitting to receiving £20,000 for her story, described her extreme survivor&#x27;s guilt: &quot;I only want to get justice for the girls who didn&#x27;t make it. I feel like it was my fault.&quot;

===Defence testimony===
Ferguson emphasised that Fred, before meeting Rose, had committed at least one murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution&#x27;s case was largely circumstantial. He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred&#x27;s sadism and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner.

Against the advice of her counsel, Rose herself testified; her affect sometimes morose and tearful, sometimes upbeat and humorous. She wept while describing herself as a victim of child sexual abuse who naively married a violent and domineering man, but joked about issues such as her &quot;always being pregnant&quot; and laughed while describing one victim&#x27;s &quot;grandfather glasses&quot;. Rose also claimed never to have met six of the victims buried at Cromwell Street, and to recall very little of her assault on Owens. When shown photographs of the victims buried in the cellar and of victim Alison Chambers, and asked by Leveson whether she recognised any of their faces, Rose&#x27;s face turned bright red and she repeatedly stuttered as she replied, &quot;No, sir.&quot;

When questioned as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose claimed she and Fred had lived separate lives, which was inconsistent with the earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at their address. In reference to her relationship with her eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained before claiming to the court that her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather&#x27;s disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after she had left home.

The defence next called a succession of women who claimed to have been attacked or assaulted by a lone male whose physical description matched that of Fred between 1966 and 1975. These seven women each testified they had recognised their attacker as Fred when his photograph appeared in the media in 1994. The intention of this testimony was to illustrate to the jury that Fred was capable of abducting, assaulting or attempting to attack women without Rose, which the prosecution had never disputed. The physical recollections of several of these women varied greatly.

The final witness to testify at Rose&#x27;s trial was Fred&#x27;s appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, whom the prosecution had called to testify on 7 November in rebuttal to the tape recordings of Fred&#x27;s confession which had been played to the court on 3 November, in which he had stressed Rose had &quot;known nothing at all&quot; about the murders. Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a confidante, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a pact whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being &quot;some of Rose&#x27;s mistakes&quot;. Fred had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated and had also murdered Robinson. He had also confided that Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Robinson, having personally removed her child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had &quot;played a major part&quot; in these murders.

Upon cross-examination, Leach did concede to Ferguson she had earlier lied under oath about having sold her story to a national newspaper for £100,000, although she was adamant as to the sincerity of her testimony. While delivering this testimony, Leach collapsed and the trial was adjourned for six days. She returned to complete her cross-examination on 13 November.

===Conviction===
After seven weeks of evidence the judge instructed the jury, emphasising that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for a finding of guilt and that if two people take part in a murder the law considers them equally guilty regardless of which of them did the deed. On 21 and 22 November 1995, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts for all ten murders. Terming her crimes &quot;appalling and depraved&quot;, Mr Justice Mantell sentenced Rose to life imprisonment, emphasising that she should never be paroled. The Lord Chief Justice later decided that she should spend at least twenty-five years in prison, but in July 1997, Home Secretary Jack Straw subjected Rose to a whole life tariff. This was the second instance of a whole life tariff imposed on a woman in the UK in modern times, the first being serial killer Myra Hindley in 1990.

====Appeal====
Almost immediately after being found guilty, Rose lodged an appeal against her ten murder convictions with the Court of Appeal, claiming that her husband (who had confessed to police during questioning that he had murdered up to thirty people) had committed the murders single-handedly, restating her claims that she had also been victimised by Fred and that she tried to prevent one of the sexual assaults. On 18 March 1996, however, the Court of Appeal refused to consider her application for an appeal to be heard. In September 2001, Rose announced her intention not to lodge further appeals against her convictions while maintaining her innocence.

==Incarceration==
Initially, Rose was incarcerated at HM Prison Bronzefield, Middlesex, as a Category A prisoner; she was later transferred to HM Prison Low Newton in County Durham.

It was first reported in May 1995 that Rose and the Moors murderer Myra Hindleywho were both incarcerated in HM Prison Durham at the time (Rose was on remand)had formed a &quot;friendship&quot;. Hindley denied the claims. Rose acknowledged that they knew each other from being on the same wing, but denied further speculation that the two were &quot;having an affair&quot;.

In 2019, she was transferred to HM Prison New Hall in West Yorkshire. It was reported that serial killer Joanna Dennehy, who had just been transferred to Low Newton, had threatened to kill West and this was the reason for her transfer, although official sources stated that the reports were untrue.

<text>WDRB (channel 41) is a television station in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Block Communications alongside Salem, Indiana–licensed dual CW/MyNetworkTV affiliate WBKI (channel 58). The two stations share studios on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard (near US 150) in downtown Louisville; WDRB&#x27;s transmitter is located in rural northeastern Floyd County, Indiana (northeast of Floyds Knobs).

WDRB went on the air in February 1971 as the first independent station in the Louisville market, being owned in turn by a Missouri consortium, the Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Company, and Block. It affiliated with Fox at the network&#x27;s launch in 1986 and began producing local newscasts in 1990. Initially starting with just one newscast at 10 p.m., in the 2000s and 2010s it expanded its news operation into morning and evening time slots.

==History==
The first construction permit for channel 41 in Louisville was issued in 1953 to Robert Rounsaville, owner of WLOU (1350 AM), Louisville&#x27;s first Black-oriented radio station. The station, if built, would have been the first Black-oriented TV station in the country. However, the construction of WQXL-TV depended on the success of the first of three planned stations, Atlanta&#x27;s WQXI-TV, which failed and left the air in 1955. The permit remained active for several more years; the call letters were changed to WTAM-TV, and in 1963 the permit was sold to Producers, Inc., of Evansville, Indiana, but no station ever materialized. Producers was related to the Polaris Corporation, which in Louisville owned WKYW (900 AM).

===As an independent station===
On July 7, 1965, Consolidated Broadcasting Company, a group of five people from Chillicothe, Missouri, with no television station experience at the time (but who were eventually shareholders in KCIT-TV in Kansas City), filed for a construction permit for the channel. The permit was granted on April 20, 1966, but it would be nearly five years before any station came to air. Antenna height issues and permitting setbacks caused delays for the new WDRB-TV and for another applicant on channel 21. Approval was finally obtained that summer, and Consolidated renovated a building that had housed a lithograph studio on East Main Street in the Butchertown neighborhood to serve as WDRB-TV&#x27;s studios.

WDRB-TV finally signed on the air on February 28, 1971, becoming the first independent station in the Louisville market. Initially, the station signed on at 3 p.m. on weekdays; its programming included low-budget afternoon children&#x27;s programming, occasional news updates provided by anchor Wilson Hatcher, and, most notably, the Saturday night horror film strand &quot;Fright Night&quot;, hosted by local theater actor Charlie Kissinger. Not long after going on air, WDRB-TV debuted an afternoon children&#x27;s program, &quot;Presto the Magic Clown&quot;, hosted by Bill &quot;Presto&quot; Dopp. The station was profitable within months and unexpectedly respectable, matching then-ABC affiliate WLKY (channel 32) in the ratings, even without a local news department. General manager Elmer Jaspan credited the station&#x27;s immediate success to a strong signal, programming, and the fact that the Louisville market already had a commercial UHF station.
Consolidated Broadcasting Corporation sold the station in 1977 to the &quot;Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune&quot; Company (which later became the Cowles Media Company) for $6.5 million. In 1980, the station moved from Butchertown to its present location on Muhammad Ali Boulevard. However, one upgrade that Cowles sought failed to materialize. Beginning in late 1977, WDRB-TV had campaigned for a shift to channel 21. In 1981, however, an administrative law judge denied the application and preferred the competing bid from the Word Broadcasting Network, only for the FCC review board to overturn the decision.

Cowles exited television in the early 1980s; after selling its only other station, KTVH in Hutchinson, Kansas, it sold WDRB to Block Communications of Toledo, Ohio, for $10 million in 1983. Under Block, WDRB-TV dropped the channel 21 application, clearing the way for WBNA to launch on the channel. Block began to increase WDRB&#x27;s profile in the market by acquiring higher-rated and more recent off-network sitcoms and dramas to its schedule, along with a focus on the broadcast rights for the burgeoning athletic programs of the University of Louisville&#x27;s Cardinals, which the station won in 1985 and held for two years.

===As a Fox affiliate===
On October 9, 1986, WDRB-TV became an affiliate of the Fox network. For a time in the 1990s, it was one of two affiliates serving the overall market: in 1992, Campbellsville-based WGRB (channel 34, later CW affiliate WBKI-TV) affiliated with the network. WDRB became the sole Fox station in Louisville when WGRB became affiliated with The WB in 1997.
In 1990, the station also regained rights to Louisville athletics after the university spent three years with WHAS-TV and upgraded its transmitter, improving signal coverage. In 1994, Block Communications entered into a local marketing agreement to operate Salem, Indiana–based WFTE (channel 58, later WMYO, now WBKI), which it programmed with new syndicated shows and programs channel 41 no longer had time to air due to Fox network commitments. Block acquired WFTE outright in 2001, creating the first television station duopoly in the Louisville market; this was allowed by the FCC even though there were fewer than eight unique commercial station owners because WFTE had only been put on the air as a result of the original local marketing agreement.
On April 21, 2007, WDRB became the first television station in Louisville to televise the Kentucky Derby Festival&#x27;s all-day &quot;Thunder Over Louisville&quot; air and fireworks show in high definition—which, at the time, was one of the largest technical undertakings ever attempted by an American television station. This was followed by a second—even more elaborate—&quot;Thunder&quot; telecast in HD in April 2008 as part of a new agreement under which the four major news-producing stations rotated the rights to Thunder.

The station began phasing out the &quot;Fox 41&quot; branding in favor of simply branding by the WDRB call letters in May 2011. While this occurred shortly after sister station KTRV-TV in Boise, Idaho, unexpectedly lost its Fox affiliation, station management stated that the rebrand was done in order to bring its branding in line with Louisville&#x27;s other major network stations, which have all long branded with their call letters. Additionally, management wanted to distinguish the station from Fox News Channel.

In May 2013, WDRB began construction of an additional of space at its Muhammad Ali Boulevard studio facility, including an expanded newsroom and sales area; the addition of two conference rooms; offices for finance and editing departments; and the addition of a secondary studio to be used for commercial and station projects. The $1.7 million expanded facility opened on May 5, 2014; as a result of the expansion, sister station WBKI-TV relocated its 10 employees from that station&#x27;s offices in the Kaden Tower into the WDRB facility. Bill Lamb, who had been general manager of Block&#x27;s Louisville stations since 2001, was hired by Fox Television Stations in 2019 to run that company&#x27;s KTTV and KCOP-TV in Los Angeles.

==News operation==
After more than a year of planning, WDRB launched its news department on March 12, 1990, with the debut of a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast, originally titled &quot;The News at 10&quot;. Several longtime news personalities in the Louisville market joined the new WDRB news staff when the station formed its news operation. &quot;The News at 10&quot; was originally anchored by Lauretta Harris (who joined WDRB from WAVE), Jim Mitchell (who started in the market at WHAS-TV, before moving to WAVE), meteorologist Tammy Garrison, and sports anchor David Sullivan. A weekend edition of &quot;The News at 10&quot; debuted that October, pairing ex-WLKY staffer Bill Francis with Susan Sweeney, who prior to joining channel 41 had worked at WHAS radio.

In 1995, the program was retitled as &quot;Fox News at 10&quot; and expanded to one hour. WDRB launched additional newscasts on its schedule as its ratings position in the market strengthened: the first news expansion outside its established 10 p.m. slot came on October 5, 1998, when WDRB premiered the three-hour-long &quot;Fox in the Morning&quot; and a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30 a.m. (originally titled &quot;Fox First News&quot;); the latter program expanded to an hour on September 21, 2015, with the addition of a half-hour noon newscast. This was later followed by the debut of an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast in September 2001 and weekly editorials by general manager Bill Lamb, the first on any Louisville station since the 1980s, in 2002. The morning newscast was retooled in 2003 as a news-oriented program after ratings took a nosedive during the start of the Iraq War.

Since 2011, WDRB has continued to fill out its newscast schedule, with evening newscasts at 6:30 p.m. in 2011, 6 p.m. in 2014, and 5 p.m. news in 2019, the latter hosted by longtime WAVE anchor Scott Reynolds. One expansion—a 7 p.m. newscast for WBKI-TV (channel 34), was broadcast from 2012 to 2015. The station also has added morning newscasts, including weekend morning news in 2013 and a 9 a.m. weekday morning news extension in 2023. 

In June 2013, WDRB gained notice in the television industry when it debuted a promo criticizing the broad, constant and generalized use of the term &quot;breaking news&quot; by other news stations (both within the Louisville market and around the United States), stating that &quot;breaking news&quot; has been overused as a &quot;marketing ploy&quot; by other stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, WDRB posted on its website a &quot;contract&quot; outline of its journalism practices with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to judiciously use &quot;breaking news&quot; (applying the term to stories that are &quot;both &#x27;breaking&#x27; and &#x27;news&#x27;&quot;), as well as a general promise to deliver news in a truthful, balanced and informative manner, and without overt hype and sensationalism.

The station gained national attention in November 2019 for a sweeps interview with the founder of Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, John Schnatter (who had been a controversial local figure since his July 2018 ouster over use of a racial slur on a conference call). Schnatter had made the claim to WDRB&#x27;s Stephan Johnson that he had found the quality control of the chain had declined after saying he ordered forty pizzas to eat from it in a month-long period and warned of a &#x27;day of reckoning&#x27; for company board member Mark Shapiro for participating in Schnatter&#x27;s ouster from the company.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
This station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WDRB began broadcasting three subchannels of WBKI as part of that multiplex&#x27;s September 2022 conversion to ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) broadcasting.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WDRB discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 41, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 49, using virtual channel 41. The station was repacked from channel 49 to channel 32 in 2019.

<doc id="872770" wikidata="Q2017651" url="?curid=872770" title="X the Unknown">
<text>X the Unknown is a 1956 British science fiction horror film directed by Leslie Norman and starring Dean Jagger and Edward Chapman. It was made by the Hammer Film Productions company and written by Jimmy Sangster. The film is significant in that &quot;it firmly established Hammer&#x27;s transition from B-movie thrillers to out-and-out horror/science fiction&quot; and, with &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; (1955) and &quot;Quatermass 2&quot; (1957), completes &quot;an important trilogy containing relevant allegorical threads revealing Cold War anxieties and a diminishing national identity resulting from Britain&#x27;s decrease in status as a world power&quot;.

==Plot==
The film opens in rural Scotland. In a deserted field, soldiers take turns familiarizing themselves with how to use a Geiger counter. Then, there is an explosion. One soldier dies of radiation exposure while another is badly burned. At the site, there is a Y-shaped crack in the ground with no apparent bottom. Dr. Royston of the Atomic Energy Laboratory, is called in to investigate. He is later joined by &quot;Mac&quot; McGill, who runs security at the UK Atomic Energy Commission. That night, a local boy witnesses an horrific off-camera sight. He dies the next day of radiation burns. Royston investigates and comes upon a tower occupied by an old man in possession of a canister left over from previous radiation experiments. Later, in a local hospital, a young doctor collapses and melts after witnessing the same off-screen horror as the boy.

The same evening, when two soldiers mysteriously die while guarding the Y-shaped crack, Royston&#x27;s colleague Peter Elliott volunteers to be lowered into the pit to investigate. Before long, he encounters the same off-screen horror as witnessed before. However, he is pulled out of the pit in the nick of time. The army uses flamethrowers to try to kill the unseen creature but to no avail. Royston hypothesizes an explanation for the phenomenon. His theory involves a form of life that existed in distant prehistory when the Earth&#x27;s surface was largely molten. This entity had been trapped by the crust of the Earth as it cooled. But every 50 years there is a tidal surge that these creatures feel, causing them to reach the surface and find &quot;food&quot; in the form of radioactive sources.

The thing is finally revealed – an ever-growing blob, now crawling its way toward the Laboratory to feed on cobalt being used there. Royston and McGill accurately predict its movement. They proceed to a location where they set up two large &quot;scanners&quot; on lorries and a canister of cobalt as bait. Peter drives the bait by jeep, drawing the blob&#x27;s deadly attention. Eventually, the creature is neutralized and explodes. But as the team approaches the crack from which the monster had emerged, a second, more powerful explosion occurs, knocking several off their feet. Puzzled, the team continues approaching the crack, presumably to make further tests, as the film comes to an end.

==Production==
The film was originally intended by Hammer to be a sequel to the previous year&#x27;s successful &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, but writer Nigel Kneale refused permission for the character of Bernard Quatermass to be used.

The original director of the film was Joseph Losey, working under the name Joseph Walton – Losey was an American director who had moved to the UK after being placed on the Hollywood blacklist. Although Losey did begin shooting the film and some of his footage is included in the final cut, he was replaced by Leslie Norman due to illness. An alternative version is that Jagger refused to work with him because of his blacklisting.

Norman was borrowed from Ealing. He had just made his directorial debut with &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot; (1955). He later said &quot;I hated working at Hammer ... because I never got on with [Producer] Anthony Hinds.&quot;

Filming took place at Bray Studios in Berkshire. Half the film&#x27;s budget was provided by Sol Lesser, a producer for RKO Pictures. This amount, $30,000, went towards the salary for Dean Jagger. Nonetheless, the American distribution deal between Hammer and RKO fell through due to the latter company&#x27;s pending demise, and the film was distributed in the U.S. by Warner Bros.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;X the Unknown&quot; intriguingly suggests a new addition to the science fiction repertoire of Things, but after a series of prolonged climaxes, with its potential victims staring directly into the camera and shaking with fright, the &quot;Unknown&quot; finally emerges as a type of rolling rubber mattress, disappointingly unhorrific in content and appearance. Scientific explanations for the object&#x27;s arrival are disconcertingly vague; one is left with the impression that the &quot;Unknown&quot; has been created with the sole purpose of manoeuvring its elaborate destruction, and the script sometimes suggests this in a number of unintentionally comic lines. It seems likely, therefore, that enthusiasts may find the present adventure rather tame when compared with the more grisly experiments of Professor Quatermass.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewed the film twice. The first reviewer, &quot;Myro&quot;, wrote in 1956: &quot;X the Unknown&quot; is a highly imaginative and fanciful meller, with tense dramatic overtones which will help it along at the boxoffice. ... Made with creditable slickness, it tells a story which is completely absorbing, though totally unbelievable. There&#x27;s little let-up in the action, and suspense angles are kept constantly to the forefront. Laboratory experiments in an atomic research station have an impressive, but familiar appeal, though ultimately they play a key role in the plot. War Office cooperated in the production, and its seal on a story of this kind should have some value. ... The scenes on the desolate moor, the sight of the grim atomic mass moving relentlessly towards its main target, the closeups of the radio-active victims, and the ultimate efficacy of the neutralizer combine in achieving a tense, almost horrific atmosphere. The acting, though mainly stereotype in style, is in the same vein, with Jagger, Edward Chapman and Leo McKern leading a vigorous cast. Marianne Brauns does a standout bit as the nurse, revealing a warm pert personality.&quot; The next reviewer, &quot;Whit&quot;, said the following year: &quot;Poor and complicated science-fictioner not for discriminating audiences. ... This picture carries a complicated structure difficult to follow. The &#x27;unknown&#x27; that serves as the menace in [this] science-fiction yarn is so vague that audiences may be overmystified. ...Roles are strictly static and Leslie Norman&#x27;s direction isn&#x27;t able to rise above what was handed him.&quot;

&quot;Films and Filming&quot; called the film &quot;a welcomed change from interplanetary yarns.&quot;

<text>Dragons RFC () are one of the four professional rugby union regional teams in Wales. They have been owned by Dragons RFC Ltd since 2023, having been solely owned by the Welsh Rugby Union from 2017 to 2023 and jointly owned by the WRU and Newport RFC between 2004 and 2017. Dragons play their home games at Rodney Parade, Newport, which was the home of Newport RFC from 1877 to 2017, and is shared with Newport County AFC, the city&#x27;s English Football League team. They play in the United Rugby Championship and the European Rugby Champions Cup/European Rugby Challenge Cup. The region they represent covers an area of southeast Wales including Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen with a total population approaching 600,000 and they are affiliated with a number of semi-professional and amateur clubs throughout the area, including Pontypool RFC, Caerphilly RFC, Cross Keys RFC, Ebbw Vale RFC and Newport RFC.

Formed in 2003 as a result of the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales, the team started life with a third-place finish in the 2003–04 Celtic League, and finished fourth the next season; however, the team finished in the bottom three in each of the next four seasons. In 2007, they reached the semi-finals of the European Challenge Cup, losing to French side ASM Clermont Auvergne 46–29. In 2011, they reached the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup, losing to Gloucester. They are yet to make the knock-out stage of the European Rugby Champions Cup.

==History==
===Formation===

The regional team were formed on 1 April 2003, following an agreement between Ebbw Vale RFC and Newport RFC to form one of five regional rugby entities. Fundamental disagreements between the clubs saw a period of arbitration, led by the then Welsh Rugby Union chief executive David Moffett, which recommended the name &quot;Gwent Dragons&quot;. On 28 July the side was launched under that name. This prompted Newport RFC benefactor Tony Brown of Bisley, Surrey to withdraw his financial support for the region. However, by 21 August Brown returned after Ebbw Vale chairman Marcus Russell resigned and the side&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Newport and Gwent Dragons&quot;. With the Welsh Rugby Union demanding an explanation for the changes, and acrimony between the two clubs another agreement was struck: the side officially became &#x27;Newport Gwent Dragons&#x27;. On 12 November 2003, the region&#x27;s founding company Gwent Rugby Ltd entered into
administration. On 27 November a new company, Dragons Rugby Ltd., was established to run the region, with Newport RFC and the Welsh Rugby Union each holding a 50% stake.

===2003–2005: Infancy===

Under Mike Ruddock and his assistant Clive Griffiths Newport Gwent Dragons, with a squad largely drawn from the Newport RFC and Ebbw Vale RFC sides of the preceding year, beat their limited pre-season expectations. Despite starting their life in top-class rugby with a 35–11 defeat away to Llanelli Scarlets, it was the region&#x27;s most successful season so far. A 29–19 win over the Ospreys was to prove more telling; captained by Andy Marinos the side remained unbeaten at home in the Celtic League and eliminated Stade Français in the Heineken Cup. Going into the final round with an outside chance of taking the title, the Dragons finished third in the Celtic League WRU bosses were impressed enough to appoint Ruddock to the vacant Welsh coaching job in summer 2004. In 2005, Ruddock guided Wales to a Grand Slam Title in the Six Nations. Ruddock rewarded two of his former Dragons players, Hal Luscombe and Jason Forster, with their first test caps on Wales&#x27; summer tour of Argentina. Wales Percy Montgomery also impressed Springbok selectors enough to remind them of his international credentials, and earn a Tri Nations recall.

The following off season saw a marked change in direction. Gareth Cooper, Kevin Morgan and Ceri Sweeney were amongst a handful of players who joined the region when the Celtic Warriors were disbanded. Having originally agreed to replace Mike Ruddock as head coach, Declan Kidney decided instead to seek employment back home with Leinster. It was not until 27 July 2004 that former Australia national rugby league team coach Chris Anderson was appointed, with Leigh Jones as his assistant. Another credible Celtic League campaign followed, finishing fourth, the second highest Welsh region. The side&#x27;s Heineken Cup could be viewed as a wasted opportunity: the team beat French side Perpignan 27–14 at home, but were then beaten home and away by Newcastle Falcons to put paid to any quarter-final ambitions. Chris Anderson&#x27;s contract was not extended beyond its initial one-year duration.

===2005–2011 Paul Turner era ===

The region looked to Harlequins backs coach Paul Turner, a Welshman, as their new head coach. Turner would also have to contend with Percy Montgomery returning to South Africa and Newport RFC stalwart Rod Snow retiring. Munster and Sale Sharks proved too strong in the 2005–06 Heineken Cup. After finishing 8th in the Celtic League, a 24–15 defeat Overmach Parma in a play-off for a place in the following seasons Heineken cup proved a new low for the region. Anglo-Welsh Cup wins over Leicester Tigers and Northampton Saints were the highlights of a tough season. Turner remained, but Wales international Hal Luscombe opted for a move away from the region, joining English Premiership side Harlequins.

Former Wales captain Colin Charvis joined ahead of the 2006–07 season with the Dragons progressed into a European Challenge Cup semi-final, where they lost comfortably to ASM Clermont Auvergne. Domestically though, the region&#x27;s European exploits appeared to take their toll, finishing ninth in the Celtic League. Significantly the region avoided the prospect of a second season away from the Heineken Cup, defeating another Italian side Calvisano 22–15. The match also marked the end for departing Wales internationals Ian Gough and Gareth Cooper at Rodney Parade.

2007–08 proved to be another difficult season for the region. Signings such as scrum-half Andy Williams and flanker Richard Parks were not able to help reverse the side&#x27;s fortunes. The Dragons 2007–08 Heineken Cup campaign only saw one win against Italian side Treviso and exiting the Anglo-Welsh Cup in the pool stages for a third year running. Between completing a double over Llanelli Scarlets on 1 January to defeating the Ospreys on 6 May, the Dragons failed to win a Celtic League game. Despite finishing as the lowest-placed Welsh side in the league the region qualified for next season&#x27;s Heineken Cup, without having to play off against Italian opposition due to a failure by the Italian League to finish before a specified date.

The summer of 2008 marked a change in the Dragons recruitment policy to a more antipodean focus. Several new signings included New Zealander Tom Willis who was also appointed captain. The 2008–09 Heineken Cup saw visible signs of encouragement for the region. An opening round defeat of Glasgow at Rodney Parade and two respectable defeats to French giants Toulouse, sandwiched between narrow losses against Bath offered hope of arresting decline at Rodney Parade. Domestically in the Celtic League it was a case of same old as consecutive defeats in rearranged matches away at Cardiff Blues and the Ospreys ended any hopes of avoiding finishing as the lowest placed Welsh region and another Heineken Cup play off against Italian opposition. In record appearance holder Adam Black&#x27;s final game for the side, the Dragons ran out comfortable winners away to Calvisano to secure their place in European rugby&#x27;s premier tournament for a third season running.

The 2009–10 season brought about significant improvements in results, with the Dragons remaining unbeaten at Rodney Parade in the Celtic League until their final home match, a 20–14 loss to Cardiff Blues. Defeat also brought about the end of the Dragons bid to qualify for the inaugural Celtic League playoffs. An improved seventh-place finish did, however, mean automatic qualification for the Heineken cup as the third highest finishing Welsh region. Despite coming close to defeating Gloucester away at Kingsholm and a win at home against Glasgow, back to back losses at Biarritz put paid to the Dragons chances of progressing past the group stages of the Heineken Cup for the first time.

===2011–2017===
Turner stepped down as head coach in February 2011 with Darren Edwards taking over in a caretaker capacity. In March 2011 Edwards led the Dragons to their first Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final, where they lost to Gloucester. In April 2011 Edwards was appointed Head Coach on a full-time basis. Lyn Jones was appointed to the role of Director of Rugby in 2013 taking over a lot of on field responsibilities. He brought with him then Russia head coach Kingsley Jones who worked with him as a consultant at London Welsh. Edwards left the Dragons in February 2014 while in June, Jones was promoted to the role of head coach.

During the 2014–2015 season, the Dragons reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, having defeated the Cardiff Blues 25–21. This was their second time reaching the semi-finals, having done so in 2007. They lost 45–16 to Edinburgh in the semi-final.

The following season, the Dragons once again reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, but lost 22–12 to Montpellier.

===2017–2023: WRU ownership===

In March 2017, following a vote of Newport RFC shareholders, the Welsh Rugby Union agreed to take over the Newport Gwent Dragons in its entirety as part of a deal that also saw the WRU take ownership of the Rodney Parade ground. Following the takeover, Bernard Jackman was appointed head coach, and on 20 June 2017 it was announced that following the takeover of the region by the WRU, the region would be dropping &quot;Newport Gwent&quot; from its name with immediate effect, becoming known simply as &quot;Dragons&quot;. Jackman&#x27;s endured a difficult first season in charge in 2017–18, with the Dragons recording only two wins in the league. Despite recruiting heavily for the 2018-19 campaign, including Wales forwards Ross Moriarty and Richard Hibbard, results did not improve and Jackman was dismissed in 2019 to be replaced by Dean Ryan.

During the WRU-ownership period, the Dragons signed a large number of English-born players eligible for Wales thanks to parents or grandparents, such as Ross Moriarty, Will Talbot-Davies, Tom Griffiths, Huw Taylor, Nick Tompkins, Joe Maksymiw, Greg Bateman and Will Rowlands.

Ahead of the 2022–2023 season, the Dragons continued their extensive recruitment drive, including established props Rhodri Jones and Rob Evans, as well as locks Sean Lonsdale and George Nott from the Premiership. JJ Hanrahan joined from Clermont, while two centres; Welsh-qualified Max Clark and New Zealander Sio Tomkinson added further depth. Further signings were made in the lead up to season.

===2023 onwards: Return to private ownership===
In July 2023 a consortium headed by Dragons chairman David Buttress bought Rodney Parade and the Dragons from the WRU.

==Team name==
The naming of the region&#x27;s team caused considerable turbulence. Newport Gwent Dragons were a new side created out of the restructuring of Welsh rugby, and represent their designated region, like the Cardiff Blues, the Scarlets and the Ospreys. Some in the Welsh rugby world, such as Bobby Windsor, believed that including the name Newport would alienate some fans in the surrounding valleys. Many supporters in the wider Newport area favoured greater identification with the City of Newport and a continuation of the historic traditions of Newport RFC. Several names were suggested but all were rejected by the WRU. In the end, the WRU decided the region would be called the Gwent Dragons. However, initial response to the new region was mixed, with many fans unsure whether to buy a season ticket for the new side or to stick to their local clubs. The company set up to run the side entered administration before a game had been played, and as a compromise the word &quot;Newport&quot; was added to the team name in a double-sized font, whilst &quot;Gwent&quot; was reduced. This addition and choice of kit added a greater Newport emphasis to the region and polarised the regions&#x27; fan base: some supporters of Ebbw Vale, Pontypool, Cross Keys and Newbridge turned their backs on the regional side, claiming that Gwent was no longer being equally represented. This debate continued, with the Dragons being accused of favouritism towards their Newport feeder club rather than the other feeder clubs.

The Newport Action Group, among others, claimed the side has lost more supporters by including the name &quot;Gwent&quot; in its title. The crowds supporting Newport Gwent Dragons averaged 5,154 for the 2005–06 season, whereas in the 2002–03 season, Newport RFC was Wales&#x27; best supported club and British rugby&#x27;s fourth best with an average attendance of 8,302 – behind English Premiership clubs Leicester, Gloucester and Northampton. In the 2006–07 season, attendance averaged 5,629 at Rodney Parade.

In 2017, after the takeover by the WRU, the club was rebranded as simply “The Dragons”, omitting any geographic identifier.

On the 27 June 2022, the Dragons announced their rebranding as Dragons RFC. The new playing colours being black and amber to represent the traditional colours of Newport sporting teams and the blue of the historic Monmouthshire county. The new badge includes three fleur-de-lis derived from the county Flag of Monmouthshire.

==Kit==
The Dragons kit for the 2022–2023 season is supplied by VX3. Their current &#x27;Headline Sponsor&#x27; is Compeed.

==Home ground==
The region&#x27;s ground is the 8,700 capacity Rodney Parade ground in Newport, where they play the majority of their home games. Games are occasionally hosted at other grounds in Gwent, such as Pontypool Park or Pandy Park (home of Cross Keys RFC). These are usually pre-season or other fixtures, however occasionally league games are taken elsewhere such as in 2017 when a game against local rivals Cardiff Blues was hosted at the Constructaquote Stadium (formerly Virginia Park), home of Caerphilly RFC, due to a fixture clash with Newport County AFC; and during the 2017/18 season when the Dragons hosted a Pro14 game against Edinburgh Rugby in Eugene Cross Park, Ebbw Vale.

As a part of Judgement Day, each season a home game against a rival Welsh rugby region is hosted at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

In preparation for the 2014–15 season the Newport Gwent Dragons agreed a partnership with Caerphilly County Borough Council for the team and coaching staff to use the CCB Centre for Sporting Excellence as the new training base for the 1st team and all other age grade structures within the region. The small stadium at the centre hosts the home matches of the Dragons U23 side, which competes in the Celtic Cup. Owing to a frozen pitch at Rodney Parade, the CCB Centre hosted a Challenge Cup fixture on 22 January 2023.

<doc id="872782" wikidata="Q3562529" url="?curid=872782" title="Esophageal speech">
<text>Esophageal speech, also known as esophageal voice, is an airstream mechanism for speech that involves oscillation of the esophagus. This contrasts with traditional laryngeal speech, which involves oscillation of the vocal folds. In esophageal speech, pressurized air is injected into the upper esophagus and then released in a controlled manner to create the airstream necessary for speech. Esophageal speech is a learned skill that requires speech training and much practice. On average it takes 6 months to a year to learn this form of speech. Because of the high level of difficulty in learning esophageal speech, some patients are unable to master the skill.

The Voice Quality Symbol for esophageal speech is Œ.

==Clinical==
Esophageal speech is a skill that can help patients to communicate after a laryngectomy, the most common surgery used for the treatment of laryngeal cancer. In the operation, the larynx and the vocal cords are removed completely. After this, the end of the trachea is sewn onto the edge of an opening cut out at the lower part of the neck, creating an opening (stoma) the patient will breathe from and cough out mucus from. This hole is called a tracheostoma; the patient uses it to breathe through and cough through after the operation.

==Character==

The air moves from outside the body through the tracheostoma directly to the lungs, without passing through the upper respiratory organs of the nose, mouth, and throat. Because it bypasses the vocal folds, speech can be severely impaired, and the development of an esophageal voice becomes necessary. Esophageal speech is produced without an artificial larynx, and is achieved by pumping air from the mouth into the upper esophagus. The esophagus is slightly expanded. The air is then released in a regulated manner through the mouth, with simultaneous articulation of words. Vibration of the pharyngoesophageal sphincter replaces vibration of the glottis to produce the esophageal voice.

Many people learn a basic form of esophageal speech as children, when they speak words while burping, e.g. in competitions with friends to see who can say more of the alphabet during a burp.

Esophageal speech is quieter and more strenuous than laryngeal speech, and fewer words can be produced successively. Good esophageal speakers can produce an average of 5 words per breath and 120 words per minute. Very good esophageal speakers speak very similarly to TEP speakers.

Because of the large, vibrating pharyngo-esophageal segment, the pitch of esophageal speech is very low—between 50 and 100 Hz. In esophageal speech, pitch and intensity correlate: a low-pitched voice is produced with low intensity and a high-pitched voice is produced with high intensity. The production of the latter is more exhausting.

The voice of a speaker without a larynx sometimes has what appears to be a nasal tone to it, even though the nasal passage is no longer connected in a post-surgery laryngectomy patient. In other esophageal speakers, the tone is more similar to a deep belch.

==Tracheoesophageal puncture==
Another option for restoring speech after a laryngectomy is the tracheoesophageal puncture or TEP. In this simple surgical procedure, a small puncture is made between the trachea and the esophagus, and a one-way air valve is inserted. This air supply can be used to cause vibrations of the pharyngoesophageal sphincter in a similar manner to esophageal speech. This surgical procedure may occur during the laryngectomy (primary TEP) or after a period of time (secondary TEP).

The prosthesis is placed approximately 10–14 days post operation by a certified speech language pathologist (SLP) who specializes in ENT work. During the placement of a prosthesis, the SLP measures the depth of the puncture, chooses the correct prosthesis, and inserts it with a loading device (the entire process can occur in 30–45 minutes pending complications). Patients return for the puncture to be resized every few months after surgery. When the puncture site stops changing sizes, then a more permanent prosthesis can be placed that will last approximately 6–12 months (indwelling prosthesis). Patients may choose this route, in which case they will return to the SLP for placement every 6–12 months, or may choose a low pressure, or duckbill prosthesis that they can change independently at home every few months. This option has become increasingly popular in the past 10 years, as in many cases intelligible voicing may be achieved within minutes of placement of the prosthesis.
Some of the advantages to tracheoesophageal puncture are a higher success rate at about 95% of vocal rehabilitation and a much faster time frame compared to esophageal speech.

==Electrolarynx==
An electrolarynx is a handheld device which is held against the throat and provides vibrations to allow speech. Electrolarynges may be used immediately post-surgery with an oral adapter (the neck being too tender right after surgery). Esophageal and electrolaryngeal speech (speech with an electrolarynx) may take weeks or months of training for patients to achieve functional voicing.

<text>HMS &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was a British liner later converted into an armed merchant cruiser, pennant F40. She was launched in 1922, and sunk in battle on 5 November 1940 by the German heavy cruiser in an action which earned her captain the Victoria Cross.

==Merchant service==
The ship was launched as the Commonwealth Line steamer &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, named after the Australian bay of that name (the line named all its passenger liners after bays). She was one of five large liners that operated in the immigrant trade between the United Kingdom and Australia.

The Commonwealth Line had problems with high operating costs and frequent industrial action, so in 1928 their ships were sold to the White Star Line who operated them in the Aberdeen and Commonwealth Linean entity created by merging into the Aberdeen Line, which was a White Star subsidiary. In new ownership, &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; used Southampton as her UK port instead of London, as had been the case under Commonwealth Line management. In 1931, she was converted to a one-class ship. The accommodation was altered from 12 first class and about 712 third class passengers to a tourist class ship carrying 270 passengers. This could be increased by the addition of temporary cabins to a total of 540.

==Naval service==
&quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was requisitioned by the Royal Navy in August 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War, and armed with seven 1898-vintage BL 6-in (152 mm) guns and two QF 3-inch (76.2 mm) guns of 1894 design.
The 6-inch guns were in single centre-pivot mountings with open-backed shields, to protect against blast and splinters at best, being arranged as follows: Two on either side of the forecastle and two either side of the upper deck behind the break of the forecastle, giving two guns firing dead ahead; two guns were mounted on the quarterdeck and the seventh was on the aft deckhouse roof with full command of the stern, giving the ship three guns able to fire dead astern, or a total of four 6-inch guns available on broadside. The 3-inch AA guns were mounted on either side of the boat deck, just aft of amidships, in unusual circular open-topped casements, giving each weapon a 180-degree arc of fire to the side; they would be capable of contributing to broadside fire in an emergency.

After her acquisition and commissioning, &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was initially placed under the Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic. She was involved in an unfortunate incident on 13 October 1939 while at Rosyth, ramming the old S-class destroyer . &quot;Sabre&quot; was under repair for over six months. &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; then became a convoy escort in May 1940, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda. Given brief repairs at Halifax, Nova Scotia, she became the sole escort for the 37 merchant ships of Convoy HX 84 from Bermuda and Halifax to Britain (&quot;Jervis Bay&quot; escorted a convoy from Bermuda which merged at sea with a convoy from Halifax, since larger convoys suffered fewer losses than smaller ones due to the relatively smaller defensive perimeter of the larger surface area).

When the convoy encountered the German warship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; about south-southwest of Reykjavík, the captain of &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, Edward Fegen, ordered the convoy to scatter, and set his own ship on a course towards the German warship to draw its fire. &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was hopelessly outgunned and outranged by the 28 cm (11inch) guns of the German ship, but it attacked the larger ship with its guns, firing more to distract the German ship from the merchantmen than with hopes of doing any damage. Although the German&#x27;s shells ravaged &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, and Fegen was wounded and many crewmen killed, Fegen and the surviving crew fought on until their ship was sunk. Captain Fegen and many of the crew went down with the ship.

&quot;Jervis Bay&quot;″s sacrifice bought enough time for the convoy to begin to scatter. According to some sources, further time was bought by the freighter SS &quot;Beaverford&quot;, which engaged &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; for over four hours. However, the account published after the war by the captain of &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and the timings of the sinking show that there was no such engagement. &quot;Beaverford&quot; fled with the other ships, but was sunk during the night. In the end, the German cruiser was only able to sink five merchant ships, and the remainder of the convoy escaped.

Sixty-eight survivors of &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;″s crew of 254 were picked up by the neutral Swedish ship &quot;&quot; (three later died of their wounds). Guy Byam was one of the survivors of the sinking; he was later killed while covering an air raid over Germany for the BBC.

Captain Fegen was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross as a result of this action. The citation for his award reads:

For valour in challenging hopeless odds and giving his life to save the many ships it was his duty to protect. On the 5th of November, 1940, in heavy seas, Captain Fegen, in His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Merchant Cruiser &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, was escorting thirty-eight Merchantmen. Sighting a powerful German warship he at once drew clear of the Convoy, made straight for the Enemy, and brought his ship between the Raider and her prey, so that they might scatter and escape. Crippled, in flames, unable to reply, for nearly an hour the &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; held the German&#x27;s fire. So she went down: but of the Merchantmen all but four or five were saved.
==Memorials==
===Bermuda===
There is a monument to &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; at Albouy&#x27;s Point, in Hamilton, Bermuda, from where &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; had departed on her final mission. Bermuda was a formation point for trans-Atlantic convoys in both World Wars. During the Second World War, convoys formed at Bermuda and coded BHX merged at sea with those formed at Halifax, which were coded HX, before crossing the Atlantic as it was easier to protect one large convoy than two smaller.

The monument was unveiled on 5 November 1941, in front of a Guard of Honour provided by the Royal Marines detachment of , by Vice Admiral Sir Charles Kennedy-Purvis, Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies Station, who said:

To-day is the anniversary of a very gallant naval deed, that of the action of H.M.S. &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, in which the ship was lost with most hands, carrying out her duty on November 5th, 1940... The &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was serving at the time under my command on this station and she was well-known in this City, where her officers and ship&#x27;s company had many friends...The &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was a medium-sized liner of 16 knots, used on the Australian trade. She was taken up at the beginning of the war and armed with eight 6-inch guns, of which four could be fired on one broadside. She was manned by a crew mostly Royal Naval Reserve and Mercantile Marine. The only Royal Naval Officer was Captain Fegen, her Commander - that was all. On November 5th towards evening she was steaming in the centre of the front line of a big convoy of nearly forty ships. These ships were disposed in columns of four with the columns abeam of each other. Suddenly, the port wing ship sighted smoke on the port bow, and very soon afterwards the foretop of a man-of-war... Captain Fegen instructed the Commandant of the convoy, if this proved to be an enemy ship, to turn his convoy to starboard and to scatter, while he went out to port to engage the enemy. It soon became plain that the ship was German - one of the pocket battleships. The &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; steamed out ahead and turned to port. The convoy turned to starboard, dropping smoke floats and soon after scattered. The &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; proceeded on her course and was soon enveloped in the fire of six 11-inch guns. She was heavily straddled and hit and took fire. As soon as he was within range with his own guns, Captain Fegen opened fire and kept his 6-inch guns firing until the last. The ship became a blazing wreck and after an hour&#x27;s action went to the bottom. A few survivors were picked up that night. The &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; delayed an attack on the convoy for a while and in that time the convoy was all over the ocean, with the result that only some 20% of the ships were lost and 80% of the convoy reached home.

Now, that is a tremendous decision to take when you are faced with overwhelming odds, but I know that in Captain Fegen&#x27;s case there were no second thoughts. He had been brought up by his training of nearly forty years in His Majesty&#x27;s Navy and by tradition to believe that the duty of an escort of a convoy is to protect that convoy at all costs. This he did. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery which His Majesty the King can award.

A small ceremony is held before the monument every Remembrance Day (following the larger parade in front of the Cenotaph commemorating all of the territory&#x27;s dead of the two world wars) in which personnel from the Royal Navy, the Royal Naval Association, and the Sea Cadet Corps take part.

===Canada===
There is a monument to Captain Fegen and the crew of &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; at Ross Memorial Park in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. This is the port where she was refitted for war service in the summer of 1940.

In early 1941, the city of Owen Sound, Ontario dedicated the HMS Jervis Bay Park as a permanent memorial to the ship and to Stoker A.M. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Johnson, RCNR, a resident of the city who was a casualty of the sinking of the Jervis Bay.

===Britain===
In 2006 the Scottish town of Wick erected a plaque to the Caithness members who died in the sinking of the ship. The ship was crewed extensively from Caithness, and Wick in particular.

There was also a monument in London. The main room of the Merchant Navy Hotel (closed, 2002) was known as the &quot;Jervis Bay Room&quot;, and included a display detailing the action. It was the custom for everyone entering the room to salute the display.

===Depictions===
The Australian poet Michael Thwaites wrote a ballad about &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; in 1941, while he was serving as a naval officer in the Atlantic. It can be read in &quot;The Faber Book of War Poetry&quot; or online at the Thwaites family website.

The final action of &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; was portrayed in the movie &quot;San Demetrio London&quot;, released in 1943, regarding the tale of heavy damage and subsequent survival of , one of the vessels of Convoy HX 84. The encounter between &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; and &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; is also narrated in a short story in Alistair MacLean&#x27;s book &quot;The Lonely Sea&quot;. &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; is also commemorated by the Jervis Bay Memorial Pipe Band, located in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.

The ship is featured as a model in Scarborough&#x27;s &quot;Naval Warfare&quot; holiday show, which takes place in the summer at Peasholm Park; in the show the ship fights off an enemy battleship and submarine.

In the Ant and Cleo novels by Dominic Green, a British space fleet names one of its cruisers in the &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;&#x27;s honour.

It is also the subject of issue 47 of &quot;Hitman&quot; and in Volume 6 of the collection, which the protagonists take as an example of how to live.

The ship was later honoured by the Sea Cadets and Marine Cadets Detachment in Brock Barracks in Reading, who adopted TS Jervis Bay (Training Ship) as the name of the unit.

Two ships of the Royal Australian Navy have been named , however, for Jervis Bay, on the south coast of New South Wales.

==In popular culture==

The ship and its sinking is depicted in an early part of the 1943 film &quot;San Demetrio London&quot;.

A merchant ship, &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, is in the Tony Palmer 1969 documentary on Jack Bruce; &quot;Rope Ladder To The Moon&quot; at 11m 23s; the ship &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; figures prominently as the camera pans right.

<doc id="872785" wikidata="Q345569" url="?curid=872785" title="Ad Reinhardt">
<text>Adolph Friedrich Reinhardt (December 24, 1913 – August 30, 1967) was an abstract painter and Art theorist active in New York City for more than three decades. As a theorist he wrote and lectured extensively on art and was a major influence on conceptual art, minimal art and monochrome painting.

Most famous for his &quot;black&quot; or &quot;ultimate&quot; paintings, he claimed to be painting the &quot;last paintings&quot; that anyone can paint. He believed in a philosophy of art he called &quot;Art-as-Art&quot; and used his writing and satirical cartoons to advocate for abstract art and against what he described as &quot;the disreputable practices of artists-as-artists&quot;.

He was a member of the American Abstract Artists (AAA) and part of the movement centered on the Betty Parsons Gallery that became known as Abstract Expressionism. He was also a member of The Club, the meeting place for the New York School abstract expressionist artists during the 1940s and 1950s.

==Background==
Reinhardt was born in Buffalo, New York, and lived with his family in the Riverside section along the Niagara River. His cousin Otto and he were close, as well as the extended family, but work took his father to New York City. He later studied art history at Columbia College of Columbia University, where he was a close friend of Robert Lax and Thomas Merton. The three developed similar concepts of simplicity in different directions. Reinhardt considered himself a painter from a very early age and began winning prizes for painting in grade school and high school. Feeling that he had already acquired all the technical skills in high school he turned down scholarships at art schools and accepted a full scholarship at Columbia University which he attended from 1931 to 1935. Reinhardt studied under the art historian Meyer Schapiro. He took painting classes as an undergraduate at Columbia&#x27;s Teachers College and after graduation began to study painting with Carl Holty and Francis Criss at the American Artists School, while simultaneously studying portraiture at the National Academy of Design under Karl Anderson.

Upon finishing college he was accredited as a painter by Burgoyne Diller, which allowed him to work from 1936 until 1940 for the WPA Federal Art Project, easel division. Sponsored by Holty he became a member of the American Abstract Artists group, with whom he exhibited for the next decade. Reinhardt described his association with the group as &quot;one of the greatest things that ever happened to me&quot;. He participated in group exhibitions at the Peggy Guggenheim Gallery, and he had his first one-man show at the Artists Gallery in 1943. He then went on to be represented by Betty Parsons, exhibiting first at the Wakefield Bookshop, the Mortimer Brandt Gallery and then when Parsons opened her own gallery on 57th street. Reinhardt had regular solo exhibitions yearly at the Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in 1946. He was involved in the 1940 protest against MoMA, designing the leaflet that asked &quot;How modern is the Museum of Modern Art&quot;? His works were displayed regularly throughout the 1940s and 1950s at the Annual Exhibitions held at the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was also part of the protest against the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1950 which became known as &quot;The Irascibles.&quot;

Having completed his studies at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts, Reinhardt became a teacher at Brooklyn College in 1947 and taught there until his death from a heart attack in 1967. He also taught at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, the University of Wyoming, Yale University and Hunter College, New York.

Reinhardt&#x27;s earliest exhibited paintings avoided representation, but show a steady progression away from objects and external reference. His work progressed from compositions of geometrical shapes in the 1940s to works in different shades of the same color (all red, all blue, all white) in the 1950s.

Reinhardt is best known for his so-called &quot;black&quot; paintings of the 1960s, which appear at first glance to be simply canvases painted black but are actually composed of black and nearly black shades. Among many other suggestions, these paintings ask if there can be such a thing as an absolute, even in black, which some viewers may not consider a color at all.

In 1967 he contributed one of 17 signed prints that made up the portfolio &quot;Artists and Writers Protest Against the War in Viet Nam&quot; organized by the group &quot;Artists and Writers Protest&quot;. 
Reinhardt&#x27;s lithograph, known as &quot;No War&quot; from its first two words of text, shows both sides of an air mail post card addressed to &quot;War Chief, Washington, D.C. U.S.A.&quot; with a list of 34 demands that includes &quot;no napalm,&quot; &quot;no bombing,&quot; &quot;no poverty,&quot; &quot;no art of war,&quot; and admonitions concerning art itself, &quot;no art in war&quot; and &quot;no art on war.&quot; That same year, Reinhardt received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

===Writings===
His writing includes comments on his own work and that of his contemporaries. His concise wit, sharp focus, and sense of abstraction make them interesting reading even for those who have not seen his paintings. Like his paintings, his writing remains controversial decades after its composition. Many of his writings are collected in &quot;Art as Art&quot;, edited by Barbara Rose, University of California Press, 1991.

=== Graphics ===
Reinhardt joined the staff of &quot;PM&quot; in 1942 and he worked full-time at this daily newspaper until 1947, with time out while drafted for active duty in the U.S. Navy. While at &quot;PM&quot; he produced several thousand cartoons and illustrations most notably the series of famous and widely reproduced &quot;How to Look at Art&quot; series. Reinhardt also illustrated the highly influential and controversial pamphlet &quot;Races of Mankind&quot; (1943) originally intended for distribution to the U.S. Army, but after being banned subsequently sold close to a million copies. He also illustrated a children&#x27;s book &quot;A Good Man and His Good Wife&quot;. While attending Columbia University he designed many covers and illustrations for the humor magazine &quot;Jester&quot; and was its editor in his senior year (1934–35). In 1940 he was the designer of &quot;The Chelsea Document&quot;, a public exhibition of five 4x8 foot panels. Other commercial art work was done &quot;for such varied employers as the Brooklyn Dodgers, Glamour magazine, the CIO, Macy&#x27;s, The New York Times, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, The Book and Magazine Guild, the American Jewish Labor Council, New Masses, the Saturday Evening Post, Ice Cream World, and &quot;Listen&quot; magazine. He illustrated many books such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Zoo&quot;. Cartoons and illustrations were generally regarded as outside the canon of fine art in 1950s America, which was dominated by abstract painting. However, this aspect of Reinhardt’s oeuvre has garnered renewed interest in recent decades. In 2013, Robert Storr curated a dedicated room showcasing Reinhardt&#x27;s cartoons at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York.

==Recent exhibitions==

<doc id="872788" wikidata="Q4424894" url="?curid=872788" title="Reginald Smith Brindle">
<text>Reginald Smith Brindle (5 January 1917 – 9 September 2003) was a British composer and writer.

==Early life==

Smith Brindle was born in Cuerdon, Lancashire, to Robert and Jane Smith Brindle. He began learning the piano at the age of six, and later took up the clarinet, saxophone and guitar (and won a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; prize for his guitar-playing). Under pressure from his parents, he began to study architecture. At the time, he was interested in jazz, and played saxophone professionally for a while alongside his studies. On attending an organ recital at Chester Cathedral in 1937, however, he was inspired to take up both the organ and composition. He spent most of World War II serving in Africa and Italy as a captain in the Corps of Royal Engineers. It was during this period that he rekindled his interest in the guitar, an instrument for which he wrote an enormous amount of music.

==Career==

After the war, Smith Brindle returned to composition. He submitted a &quot;Fantasia Passacaglia&quot; (1946) for an Italian composition competition, and won first prize. From 1946 to 1949 he studied music at the University College of North Wales in Bangor. He went to Italy in 1949 to continue his studies. There his teachers included Ildebrando Pizzetti and Luigi Dallapiccola for composition and Fernando Germani for organ.

His compositional activity comprised three main phases: tonal until 1951; serial/&quot;dodecaphonic&quot; until c1970; and finally a freer third phase where many compositions were for his own instruments, guitar and organ.

Brindle is presently best known for his solo guitar music (which was highly regarded by players such as Andres Segovia and Julian Bream, especially &quot;El Polifemo de Oro&quot; (1956), written for Bream, as well as five sonatas (1948, 1976, 1978, 1979), &quot;Variants on two themes of J. S. Bach&quot; (1970), &quot;Memento in two movements&quot; (1973), &quot;Do not go gentle...&quot; (1974), &quot;November Memories&quot; (1974), &quot;Four Poems of Garcia Lorca&quot; (1975), &quot;Guitarcosmos&quot; (3 volumes) and &quot;The Prince of Venosa&quot; (1994).

His chamber opera &quot;The Death of Antigone&quot;, was premiered at Oxford in 1971, and later broadcast in May 1976. Notable orchestral works include two symphonies (1955 and 1989), &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (1970), &quot;Creation Epic&quot; (world premiere at the Proms on 5 August 1964), &quot;Homage to H.G. Wells&quot; (1960), the &quot;Renaissance Suite&quot; (1956), &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; (1957), and &quot;Via Crucis&quot; for strings (1966). 

Smith Brindle taught from 1957 to 1970 at the University College of North Wales in Bangor, and from 1970 to 1981 at the University of Surrey. During his time at Surrey, he founded the prestigious Tonmeister course in Music and Sound Recording.} He continued to compose until 1998, being involved with the Chameleon group of composers in 1990s Croydon.

Smith Brindle was an expert on the music of 20th-century Italian composers such as Luigi Dallapiccola, Ildebrando Pizzetti and Bruno Bartolozzi (he studied with all three). He also wrote the technical book &quot;Serial Composition&quot; (1966). He played many instruments, but was particularly fond of the guitar, organ and saxophone.

==Personal life==
Smith Brindle met Giulia Borsi in Italy during the war, and they were married in Britain in 1947. Together they had one son and three daughters.

==Legacy==

Smith Brindle&#x27;s papers are preserved in the University Library Special Collections and Archives at California State University, Northridge.

<text>Gilbert Emanuel Biberian (19 February 1944 – 27 January 2023) was a British guitarist and composer.

Born in Istanbul, Turkey of Greek-Armenian heritage. Biberian&#x27;s ethnic roots was integral to his compositions. He studied at Trinity College of Music, graduating in 1968. In 1965 a French Government grant took him to France to study with Ida Presti and Alexandre Lagoya. He studied composition with James Patten, Elisabeth Lutyens and Hans Keller, as well as widening and enriching his musical knowledge by working with non-guitarists Anthony Kinsella (piano) and Vic Bennett (clarinet).

Biberian has played at the Proms, at Covent Garden and has performed concertos and given solo recitals worldwide.

He has always enthusiastically encouraged and championed the creation of new compositions for guitar. New works have been written for and/or dedicated to him (for solo and ensemble) by James Patten, Elisabeth Lutyens, Reginald Smith Brindle, Alfred Nieman, Charles Camilleri, David Bedford, Roger Williams, Glen Morgan, Robert Keeley, Jeffrey Joseph, Kenneth Paige, Daniel Sturm, Vojislav Ivanovic, Betty Roe, Ivor Mairants, Geoffrey Burgon, Aurelio Peruzzi, Judith Bingham, Monique Cecconi-Botella, Ottavio Negro and Luis Morales Giacoman.

In addition to his pioneering work in chamber music, and always in search of exciting possibilities for the guitar, he expanded the role of the instrument by combining with mime in three works, &quot;Pierrot&quot;, &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Toccata&quot; and &quot;Colombine&quot;, which are now successfully established as stage and concert pieces. He produced a great number of compositions, not only for solo and ensemble guitar but also for all string instruments including a concerto for guitar, cello and 19 strings, which received its world première at the Habana International Festival of Guitar, Cuba, in May 1992. His guitar compositions are being recorded and performed by an ever-increasing number of guitarists. Biberian&#x27;s compositions have been published in England, Italy, Holland, Canada and the US.

Biberian died on 27 January 2023, at Cheltenham General Hospital in Cheltenham (Gloucestershire), at the age of 78.

<doc id="872793" wikidata="Q1639834" url="?curid=872793" title="Edgar Broughton Band">
<text>Edgar Broughton Band were a British blues rock band founded in Warwick in 1968, and in their initial form were operative through to 1976. The group were also a significant influence on the emerging politically conscious and spiritually aware proto punk scene of the 1970s. They were a power trio consisting of brothers Edgar (vocals and guitar) and Steve Broughton (drums) with Arthur Grant (bass), which was augmented at various times by a second guitarist and/or keyboardist, significantly Victor Unitt. They released five studio albums, including &quot;Sing Brother Sing&quot; (UK Albums Chart #18), and six singles, including &quot;Out Demons Out&quot; (UK Singles Chart #39), on the EMI Harvest label and one further studio album for NEMS. The group reformed from 1978 to 1982, initially renamed as The Broughtons, issuing two more studio albums, and again from 2006 to 2010 with Edgar&#x27;s son Luke for live appearances only.

== Career ==
The band started their career as a blues group under the name of The Edgar Broughton Blues Band, playing to a small following in the region around their hometown of Warwick. However, the band began to lean towards the emerging psychedelic movement, dropping the &#x27;Blues&#x27; from their name as well as their music.

In 1968, the Edgar Broughton Band moved to Notting Hill Gate, London, seeking a recording contract and a wider audience, and were picked up by Blackhill Enterprises. Blackhill arranged their first record deal, on EMI&#x27;s progressive rock label Harvest Records, in December 1968. Their first single was &quot;Evil&quot;/&quot;Death of an Electric Citizen&quot;, released in June 1969, which was also the first single released by Harvest.

The first single was followed by the Edgar Broughton Band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Wasa Wasa&quot;. &quot;Wasa Wasa&quot; retained a heavily blues influenced sound that was hard-driven and propelled by Edgar Broughton&#x27;s gritty vocal style, which was similar to that of Captain Beefheart and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. The Broughtons entered into an attempt to capture their live sound on record by organising a performance at Abbey Road on 9 December 1969. Only one track was released at the time: a rendition of &quot;Out Demons Out&quot;, an adaptation of The Fugs&#x27; song &quot;Exorcising the Demons Out Of the Pentagon&quot;, which had become the band&#x27;s set-closer and anthem. The rest of the recording was lost until its rediscovery and release in a remixed form in 2004 as &quot;Keep Them Freaks a Rollin&#x27;: Live at Abbey Road 1969&quot;.

The band&#x27;s touring attracted some controversy from a series of free concerts at locations such as children&#x27;s playgrounds, and from a number of cases of civil disorder occurring at their shows. The most notorious incidents were a show in Redcar at which a fight broke out between audience members and led to violent police intervention, and a show in Keele where the audience vandalised the venue using paint given to them by the band. Though the band denied doing anything to incite any of these incidents (in the case of Keele, Edgar Broughton admitted to giving paint to the audience but argued that &quot;we didn&#x27;t tell them to do anything with it&quot;), several towns banned the group&#x27;s concerts.

The Edgar Broughton Band kept recording, releasing the live performance of &quot;Out Demons, Out!&quot; as a single (b/w &quot;Momma&#x27;s Reward (Keep Those Freaks a Rollin&#x27;)&quot;) and following it, in June 1970, with the album &quot;Sing Brother Sing&quot;. This was accompanied by the single &quot;Up Yours!&quot; (b/w &quot;Officer Dan&quot;), a polemic on the 1970 General Election declaring their intention to drop out. The song featured a string arrangement by David Bedford.

Their next single, &quot;Apache Dropout&quot;, combined The Shadows&#x27; &quot;Apache&quot; with Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Drop Out Boogie&quot;. Jerry Lordan, the composer of &quot;Apache&quot;, insisted that the title be &quot;Apache Dropout&quot; instead of the original &quot;Drop out Apache&quot;. The single reached No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1971, the band decided that existence as a power trio was limiting, and asked Victor Unitt, who had been playing meanwhile in The Pretty Things, to rejoin the band. In May, with the new lineup, they released their eponymous third album, which contained &quot;Evening Over Rooftops&quot; (again with strings by David Bedford). &quot;Edgar Broughton Band&quot; contained heavy blues and even country influences.

The album was followed by the release of the double A-side &quot;Hotel Room&quot;/&quot;Call Me A Liar&quot;. The single failed to chart, but the album sold well throughout Europe, especially in Germany.

With the success of their third album, the Edgar Broughton Band relocated to Devon to begin recording for their next album, &quot;In Side Out&quot;. The band then recorded their fifth album, &quot;Oora&quot;, in 1972; following the release of this album Unitt departed the band.

In 1975 the band signed to NEMS. In the same year, John Thomas joined the band on guitar for the Broughtons&#x27; sixth album, &quot;Bandages&quot;. This featured a softer sound than previous releases. Shortly after the release of &quot;Bandages&quot;, John Thomas left and was replaced by Terry Cottam. In 1976, having recorded the live album &quot;Live Hits Harder&quot; (which was not released until 1979), the Edgar Broughton Band dissolved.

However, Edgar and Steve Broughton together with Grant regrouped as The Broughtons to release &quot;Parlez-Vous English?&quot; in 1979, with Tom Nordon and Pete Tolson (ex-Pretty Things) playing guitar and Richard de Bastion on keyboards. This was the Band&#x27;s first adventure into a fuller, more orchestral style of heavy rock. Pete Tolson was not retained after the release of the album and was replaced by John Thomas for the two years of European touring that followed. Tom Nordon appears again, along with keyboardists Duncan Bridgeman and Dennis Haynes, on &quot;&quot;, released in 1982.

After this the band dissolved again; recording no more studio material but touring infrequently throughout the 1980s and 1990s. A mini-tour in 1989 included a gig at The Oval in London. The band reformed properly once again in 2006, with Edgar&#x27;s son Luke joining on keyboards and guitar, after the re-issue of their back catalogue had stimulated new interest in their work. They had a mini tour of England and Germany then completed a European tour in 2007, including an appearance at the German . The Edgar Broughton Band disbanded once again in 2010, with Edgar Broughton opting to continue to perform as a solo artist. Steve Broughton died on 29 May 2022.

<text>Sovereign Hill is an open-air museum in Golden Point, a suburb of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. Sovereign Hill depicts Ballarat&#x27;s first ten years after the discovery of gold there in 1851 and has become a nationally acclaimed tourist attraction. It is one of Victoria&#x27;s most popular attractions and Ballarat&#x27;s most famous.

Set in the Australian 1850s, the complex is located on a 25-hectare site that is linked to the richest alluvial gold rush in the world. The site comprises over 60 historically recreated buildings, with costumed staff and volunteers, who are able to answer questions and will pose for photos. The recreation is completed with antiques, artwork, books and papers, machinery, livestock and animals, carriages, and devices all appropriate to the era.

==History==
The second-largest gold nugget in the world was found in Ballarat in the Red Hill Mine which is recreated in Sovereign Hill. The Welcome Nugget weighed 69 kg,(2,200 ounces) and comprised 99.2% pure gold, valued at about 10,596 pounds when found, and worth over US$3 million in gold now, or far more as a specimen.

The idea of Sovereign Hill was floated in Ballarat in the 1960s, as a way to preserve historic buildings and to recreate the gold diggings that made the city. The complex was officially opened to the public on 29 November 1970.

Main street is a loose reconstruction of Main Street, Ballarat East which was once the settlement&#x27;s main street, consisting of timber buildings. It was consumed in a large fire during the 1860s and a more substantial town centre planned around Sturt and Lydiard Street in Ballarat West.

==Attractions==

The gold diggings are the centre point of the complex, featuring a winding creek in which visitors are able to pan for real gold. This area is surrounded by tents and buildings contemporary to the early years of the gold rush. A recent addition to Sovereign Hill is the Gold Pour where pure gold valued at $300,000 is melted and poured into a three-kilogram bullion bar.

There are two mines which have guided tours at regular intervals. The Red Hill Mine is a self-guided tour that tells the story of a group of Cornishmen and their discovery of the Welcome Nugget. The Sovereign Quartz Mine runs 40-minute guided tours and features several underground displays. Above ground it also features steam-driven machinery for pumping water and processing the ore. More recently an attraction titled &quot;Trapped&quot; has been added. This exhibit, which is set in series of above-ground concrete structures designed to look like tunnels from within, tells the story of the New Australasian Gold Mine disaster at Creswick in 1882. Twenty-two miners died because of the collapse and flooding of the New Australasian No. 2 Mine. This is still considered one of Australia&#x27;s worst mining disasters. Australia&#x27;s worst mining disaster was the Mount Keira Mine Disaster in 1902 which killed 96 workers.

Main Street is lined with shops, two hotels and a theatre. There is a blacksmith&#x27;s workshop, stables, photography studio, apothecary, bakery, jeweller&#x27;s shop, grocer, tentmaker, tinsmith, bank, post office, candle-dipping shop, lolly shop, nine-pin bowling saloon and library. Behind Main Street there are a number of period cottages which are open for visitors. There are also four schools where children in school-groups dress in period costume and attend as a child of the 1850s.

A number of workshops at Sovereign Hill display traditional trades such as coachbuilder, wheelwright, tinsmith, blacksmith and farrier.

AURA is a son et lumiere show depicting the story of gold. It is run at night for a length of 90 minutes, using only sound and lights.

==Mine tram==
The Sovereign Hill mine tram, opened in March 2008, is an inclined tramway that takes tourists into the mine for a tour. Each tram is 1.35 metres wide and 1.55 metres high, and can carry 33 passengers. The tram goes through a flap, and enters a dark tunnel.

===Stations===
The Sovereign Hill mine tram has 3 stations – the top station, and two bottom stations. The two bottom stations are located in the mine, and the top station is located in a small hut, which has 2 platforms and a tram per platform. The two bottom stations only has a single platform, as each mine tram goes to a different section.

<text>The magenta petrel (Pterodroma magentae), or Chatham Island tāiko, is a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, &quot;Pterodroma&quot;. Found exclusively on Chatham Island, New Zealand, it is one of the rarest birds in the world, believed to be extinct for over 100 years before its rediscovery in the 1970s.

== Description ==
This medium-sized petrel has a brownish-grey head, neck, and upper breast, with white underparts. The undersides of the wings are brown. It has a black bill and pink legs. Adults weigh 400–580 g.

The bird nests in 1–3 m long burrows under dense forest. They form long-term monogamous pair bonds, raising one egg at a time, and both partners incubate the egg and feed the chick. The breeding season is between September and May, during which time the birds forage over the open ocean.

== History ==
Fossil records and historic records show that tāiko used to be the most abundant burrowing seabird on Chatham Island, though has not been found to have lived on other islands. Moriori, the indigenous people of the Chatham Islands, harvested tāiko among other birds for food, as evidenced by bones of tāiko found in midden deposits.

The first specimen of the Magenta petrel was collected from His Italian Majesty&#x27;s ship &quot;Magenta&quot; on July 22, 1867, in the South Pacific Ocean, midway between New Zealand and South America. The name &#x27;Magenta petrel&#x27; and the scientific name &quot;P. magentae&quot; come from this ship.

The tāiko was believed for be extinct for 111 years. Conservationist David Crockett and his team began to investigate sightings reported by locals in the 1970s, and Crockett caught a tāiko on 1 January 1978. It was another ten years before a tāiko burrow was discovered. This discovery confirmed the link between the specimen collected by the &quot;Magenta&quot; and the live birds.

== Conservation ==
Formerly widespread on Chatham Island, the tāiko is now confined to the forested Tuku Valley on the south-west of the island. The species is one of the rarest birds in the world. The species is classified as critically endangered due to an assumed population decline in excess of 80% in the last 60 years and the fact that it is restricted to one small location. In the 2005 breeding season, the 13 known breeding pairs successfully fledged 11 chicks. In 2017, 34 breeding pairs were being monitored. The current population is estimated at between 80 and 100 mature individuals.

The main threats to the species are introduced mammalian predators, principally cats and rats, other threats are present from feral pigs collapsing burrows.

The land on which tāiko were first rediscovered was privately owned by Manuel and Evelyn Tuanui, who in 1983 donated 1283 hectares of land to the government to protect the species, becoming the Tuku Nature Reserve. In a 2004 report, about 80 percent of tāiko breeding burrows were in this reserve. The Tuanui family were also founding members of the Chatham Island Taiko Trust, an organisation formed to promote taiko conservation work.

A conservation strategy is in place on the island to translocate chicks to an area where the main threats have been removed called the Sweetwater Secure Breeding Site. Studies in other petrel species such as the Manx shearwater, wandering albatross, and Cory&#x27;s shearwater, have shown that birds return to the site in which they fledged. In 2007, eight chicks were successfully translocated and fledged from the breeding site. There has also been a predator-proof fence built around a small area of land since 2006, 60 tāiko have been relocated to this area.

<text>The Alien Act 1705 (3 &amp; 4 Ann. c. 6) was a law passed by the Parliament of England in February 1705, as a response to the Parliament of Scotland&#x27;s Act of Security 1704, which in turn was partially a response to the English Act of Settlement 1701. Lord Godolphin, the Lord High Treasurer, was instrumental in the Union of 1707 and all the acts leading up to it. The Alien Act was passed to prevent the inconveniences that would occur hastily if these two Kingdoms were not to become one Union.

The Alien Act provided that Scottish nationals in England were to be treated as aliens (foreign nationals), and estates held by Scots would be treated as alien property, making inheritance much less certain. It also included an embargo on the import of Scottish products into England and English colonies – about half of Scotland&#x27;s trade, covering goods such as linen, cattle and coal. There was also an embargo on the export of arms, ammunition, and horses to Scotland so that they could not raise an army and invade England.

The Act contained a provision that it would be suspended if the Scots entered into negotiations regarding a proposed union of the parliaments of Scotland and England. The Act demanded that a settlement of succession or authorize union negotiation by December 25, 1705. The Scots insisted that the Alien Act be repealed before entering into treaty negotiations. In late December, news that both the Commons and the Lords had agreed to repeal the act reached the north. Combined with English financial offers to refund Scottish losses on the Darien scheme, the Act achieved its aim, leading to the Acts of Union 1707 uniting the two countries as the Kingdom of Great Britain.

<doc id="872828" wikidata="Q3532812" url="?curid=872828" title="M. T. Vasudevan Nair">
<text>Madath Thekkepaattu Vasudevan Narayanan Nair (15 July 1933 – 25 December 2024) was an Indian author, screenplay writer and film director. He was a prolific and versatile writer in modern Malayalam literature, and was one of the masters of post-Independence Indian literature. &quot;Randamoozham&quot;, which retells the story of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; from the point of view of Bhimasena, is widely credited as his masterpiece.

At the age of 20, as a chemistry undergraduate, he won the prize for the best short story in Malayalam for &quot;Valarthumrigangal&quot; at World Short Story Competition jointly conducted by &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, and &quot;Mathrubhumi&quot;. His first major novel, &quot;Naalukettu&quot; (&quot;The Legacy&quot;), written at the age of 23, won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958. His other novels include &quot;Manju&quot; (&quot;Mist&quot;), &quot;Kaalam&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;), &quot;Asuravithu&quot; (&quot;The Demon Seed&quot;), and &quot;Randamoozham&quot; (&quot;The Second Turn&quot;). The emotional experiences of his early days went into his novels, and most of his works are oriented towards the basic Malayalam family structure and culture. His three novels set in traditional &quot;tharavads&quot; in Kerala are &quot;Naalukettu&quot;, &quot;Asuravithu&quot;, and &quot;Kaalam&quot;.

Nair was a screenwriter and director of Malayalam films. He directed seven films and wrote the screenplay for around 54 films. He won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay four times, for: &quot;Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha&quot; (1989), &quot;Kadavu&quot; (1991), &quot;Sadayam&quot; (1992), and &quot;Parinayam&quot; (1994), which is the most by anyone in the screenplay category. In 1995 he was awarded the highest literary award in India, Jnanpith, for his overall contribution to Malayalam literature. In 2005, India&#x27;s third-highest civilian honour, Padma Bhushan, was awarded to him. He died in Kozhikode on 25 December 2024. In 2025, he received Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second-highest civilian honour, posthumously.

==Early life and education ==
Madath Thekkepaattu Vasudevan Narayanan Nair was born on 15 July 1933 in the village of Kudallur, then in Ponnani Taluk (now in Pattambi Taluk, Palakkad District). His birthplace fell under Malabar District in erstwhile Madras Presidency of the British Raj. He was the youngest of four children born to T. Narayanan Nair and Ammalu Amma. His father was in Ceylon, and he spent his early days in Kudallur and in his father&#x27;s house in Punnayurkulam, a village in the present-day Thrissur district.

Although his family did not nurture an interest in reading, Nair started writing at an early age and had his work published in magazines.

Nair attended Malamakkavu Elementary School and then Kumaranelloor High School. He had to break education after high school, and when he joined college in 1949, he was advised to opt for the science stream as it was felt that a degree in science secured a job faster than any other degree. He obtained a degree in chemistry from Victoria College, Palakkad in 1953.

He taught mathematics in Pattambi Board High School and Chavakkad Board High School for over a year and worked in M.B. Tutorial College, Palakkad during 1955–56. He also worked as a gramasevakan at a block development office in Taliparamba, Kannur for a few weeks before joining &quot;Mathrubhumi Weekly&quot; as subeditor in 1957.

==Literary career==

===Short stories===

Nair began writing at a very young age, inspired by his elder brothers who wrote time and again in several literary journals and poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri who was his senior at high school. He initially wrote poems but soon changed to prose writing. His first published work was an essay on the diamond industry of ancient India, titled &quot;Pracheenabharathathile Vaira Vyavasayam&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Keralakshemam&quot;, a biweekly published by C. G. Nair from Guruvayoor. His first story &quot;Vishuvaghosham&quot; was published in Madras-based &quot;Chitrakeralam&quot; magazine in 1948. The story explores the feelings of a boy too poor to have firecrackers of his own, as he stands listening to the sounds of crackers coming from the houses of the rich celebrating the new year festival of Vishu: an overwhelming sense of loss, the painful realisation that this is the way things are and the way they&#x27;re likely to stay. His first book, &quot;Raktham Puranda Manaltharikal&quot; was published in 1952.

Nair&#x27;s first literary prize came to him while he was a student at Victoria College, Palakkad – his short story &quot;Valarthumrigangal&quot; (Pet Animals) won first prize in the World Short Story Competition conducted by &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, and &quot;Mathrubhumi&quot; in 1954. It was a short story delineating the pathetic plight of circus artistes. The numerous stories that followed dealt with themes culled from widely different milieus and contexts but were uniformly successful and popular.

The noted collections of his stories are &quot;Iruttinte Athmavu, Olavum Theeravum, Bandhanam, Varikkuzhi, Dare-e-Salam, Swargam Thurakkunna Samayam, Vaanaprastham&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;. &quot;Iruttinte Athmavu&quot; (&quot;Soul of Darkness&quot;), one of the most celebrated among his short stories, is the heart wrenching story of a 21-year-old man, regarded as a lunatic by everyone and treated abominably. The story reveals the insanity behind the civilised and supposedly sane world. The story &quot;Sherlock&quot; moves between the rural milieu familiar to Nair&#x27;s readers and the sophisticated world of Indian immigrants in the US, highlighting the contrast between them with subtle irony. Nair wrote passionately of the cruelty hidden at the heart of a seemingly idyllic rural life (&quot;Kurukkante Kalyanam&quot; or &quot;The Jackal&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Shilalikhithangal&quot; or &quot;Stone Inscriptions&quot;) and of the privations endured by those dependent on the agricultural cycle (&quot;Karkitakom&quot; and &quot;Pallivalum Kalchilambum&quot; or &quot;Sacred Sword and Anklets&quot;). In the story &quot;Vanaprastham&quot;, he studies the delicately balanced relationship between a teacher and a student that has miraculously survived the years.

Nair was of the opinion that short story is a genre in which a writer can achieve near perfection. He, along with T. Padmanabhan, served as bridges between the early modern short story writers in Malayalam, of the so-called renaissance, and the new short story of the late fifties and sixties.

===&quot;Naalukettu&quot; and &quot;Asuravithu&quot;===

Nair&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Pathiravum Pakalvelichavum&quot; (&quot;Midnight and Daylight&quot;) was serialised in &quot;Mathrubhumi Weekly&quot; in 1957. His first major work &quot;Naalukettu&quot; (&quot;The Legacy&quot;; 1958) is a veritable depiction of the situation which prevailed in a typical joint family when its fortunes is on a steady decline. The title attributes to Nālukettu, a traditional ancestral home (&quot;Taravad&quot;) of a Nair joint family. The novel remains a classic in Malayalam fiction. It contributed to the renewal of a literary tradition initiated by S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Vaikkom Muhammad Basheer and Uroob in the 1950s. It was given the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1959. It has had 23 reprints and was translated into 14 languages and had a record sale of a half a million copies (as of 2008) and still features in the best-seller lists. Nair himself adapted the novel into a television film for Doordarshan in 1995. It won the Kerala State Television Award for the year 1996.

&quot;Asuravithu&quot; (&quot;The Demon Seed&quot;; 1972) which is set in a fictional Valluvanadan village named Kizhakkemuri can be considered almost as a sequel to &quot;Naalukettu&quot;. It has the same geophysical and socio-cultural setting. The novel describes the plight of the protagonist Govindankutty, the youngest son of a proud Nair tharavadu, as he is trapped between the social scenario, social injustice and his own inner consciousness. In &quot;Asuravithu&quot; there are clear indications of the damaging impact of an alien culture in the pollution of the indigenous culture and the disintegration of the family and the community. These two early novels—&quot;Naalukettu&quot; and &quot;Asuravithu&quot;—depict a phase in which the economic and cultural scenario of Kerala manifested symptoms which were to develop into dangerous ecocidal tendencies at a later stage.

===&quot;Manju&quot; and &quot;Kaalam&quot;===

His later novels, such as &quot;Manju&quot; (&quot;Mist&quot;; 1964) and &quot;Kaalam&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;; 1969), are characterised by profuse lyricism which cannot be found in &quot;Naalukettu&quot; or &quot;Asuravithu&quot;. The eco-feminist theme of patriarchal domination and exploitation gained more prominence in &quot;Manju&quot;, Nair&#x27;s only novel with a female protagonist (Vimala). Set in the splendid landscape of Nainital, it stands apart as set in a milieu different from the usual one, the Valluvanadan village. The plot of the novel is allegedly similar to a Hindi story &quot;Parinde&quot; (Birds, 1956), by Nirmal Verma. However, both Nair and Verma had rejected these claims.

In the novel &quot;Kaalam&quot;, Nair returned to his favourite milieu, the dilapidated joint-family Nair tarwad set against the wider backdrop of the Valluvanadan village in the backdrop of the crumbling matrilineal order of Kerala in a newly independent India. Sethu, the protagonist, is toppled over by the eddies of social, cultural and economic transformation. &quot;Kaalam&quot;, though not strictly autobiographical, has a strong autobiographical element in it. &quot;Manju&quot; had a film adaptation in 1983, written and directed by Nair himself. The novel also had a Hindi-language film adaptation titled &quot;Sharad Sandhya&quot;.

===&quot;Randamoozham&quot;===

&quot;Randamoozham&quot; (&quot;The Second Turn&quot;; 1984), retells the story of the &quot;Mahabharatha&quot; from the point of view of Bhimasena, supposed to be the son of Vayu; this is demystified or demythified in the novel. In this novel, Bhima gains, through the author&#x27;s ironic undertones, a new psychological depth. &quot;I have not changed the framework of the story by the first Vyasa, Krishna-Dwaipayana. I have read between his lines and expanded on his pregnant silences,&quot; says the author.

===&quot;Varanasi&quot;===
Nair&#x27;s novel &quot;Varanasi&quot; (2002) is based around a journey to Varanasi, a pilgrim centre in North India. With no intricate plot, the novel is an experiment. It was well received in the literary circles but received criticism from critic and painter M. V. Devan.

Nair wrote the novel &quot;Arabi Ponnu&quot; (&quot;The Gold of Arabia&quot;) along with N. P. Mohammed. Nair and Mohamed stayed in a rented house in Karuvarakkundu village, Malappuram for a period of two weeks to complete this work.

Nair authored two books on the craft of writing—&quot;Kaathikante Panippura&quot; and &quot;Kaathikante Kala&quot;—and his anecdotal columns articles on various topics and speeches on different occasions have been compiled under the titles &quot;Kilivaathililude, Kannanthalippookkalude Kaalam, Vakkukalude Vismayam&quot; and &quot;Eekakikalude Sabdam&quot;. &quot;Manushyar Nizhalukal&quot; and &quot;Aalkkoottathil Thaniye&quot; are his travelogues.

==Other activities==
Nair occupied many important positions in various literary bodies, including the presidency of Kerala Sahitya Akademi and the chairmanship of Tunchan Memorial Trust.

Nair joined the Mathrubhumi Group of Publications in 1956. He served as editor of periodicals and chief editor of &quot;Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly&quot;.

He espoused and promoted secularism through his literature, cinema, and public life. Nair created secular intellectual movement in Kerala in the 1990s for peace with many intellectuals.

==Film career==

Nair is one of the most distinguished and well accepted script writers and directors in Malayalam cinema. He has directed seven films and written the screenplay for around 54 films. He won the National Film Award for Best Screenplay four times for: &quot;Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha&quot; (1989), &quot;Kadavu&quot; (1991), &quot;Sadayam&quot; (1992), and &quot;Parinayam&quot; (1994), which is the most by anyone in the screenplay category.

Nair wrote his first screenplay in 1965 for &quot;Murappennu&quot;, at the behest of producer Shobhana Parameswaran Nair. The film was an adaptation of his story &quot;Snehathinte Mukhangal&quot;. &quot;The Hindu&quot; described it as &quot;a well-made film with a compelling plot&quot; and as &quot;one of the most significant films in the history of Malayalam cinema&quot;.

Nair was the first and foremost script writer in Malayalam who wrote screenplays after having learnt cinema as a distinctive visual art which has its own language, grammar and structure. It was only after he began writing screenplays the Malayali viewers began to consider film script as a distinctive genre which has its own genuine features. Also, it was M.T who elevated this medium of writing as a literary form.

Nair&#x27;s screenplays have won social attention for the portrayal of the social and cultural crisis in the contemporary life of Kerala. The
disintegration of human values and relationship which creates identity crisis, sense of loss, dehumanisation, alienation from one&#x27;s own surroundings, etc. have been presented in its depth by Nair more than any other writers. The best examples are &quot;Kanyakumari&quot;, &quot;Varikkuzhi&quot;, &quot;Vilkkanundu Swapnangal&quot;, Sadayam, Asuravithu, &quot;Edavazhiyile Poocha Mindappoocha&quot;, &quot;Akshrangal&quot;, &quot;Aalkkoottathil Thaniye&quot;, &quot;Aaroodam&quot; etc. A salient aspect of Nair&#x27;s screenplays is the effective presentation of the ecological or geographical factors and elements making use of the visual possibilities of their portrayal. Another unique feature is the language employed in them. Some of his screenplays are known for giving new interpretations to historical characters and historical stories. For instance, he gives the legends woven around the popular story of Perumthachan a new interpretation in his screenplay, based on his own assessment of Perumthachan&#x27;s character. According to the folklore Vadakkanpattu (Northern Ballads), Chandu is said to have betrayed his cousin because he was jealous of Aaromal&#x27;s popularity and abilities. But Nair&#x27;s &quot;Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha&quot;, set in 16th-century Kerala, presents an alternative version of the same legend, as it presents the incident from Chandu&#x27;s perspective, suggesting that grave injustice has been done to Chandu by wrongly accusing him of replacing the rivets.

In 1973, Nair made his directorial debut with &quot;Nirmalyam&quot; which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. The film is about a village oracle whose services are no longer needed by the community and whose family begins to fall apart. Nair scripted and directed many more films including the award-winning &quot;Bandhanam&quot;, &quot;Kadavu&quot; and &quot;Oru Cheru Punchiri&quot;. &quot;Kadavu&quot; won awards at the Singapore International Film Festival and Tokyo International Film Festival. His cinema work also includes three documentaries and one TV series. He has written songs for the 1981 film &quot;Valarthumrugangal&quot; which were set to tune by M. B. Sreenivasan.

Nair was the chairman of Indian Panorama of the 46th National Film Awards (1998). He has also been a member of Film Finance Corporation, National Film Development Corporation and Film Censoring Committee. He has also served as a faculty in the Film and Television Institute, Pune.

==Literary style and themes==

Nair was born and brought up in a sylvan village on the banks of Nila. The writer has so often acknowledged his indebtedness to the ethos of his village and to Nila which has ever been the mainspring of his creative inspiration. Nila occurs and re-occurs in Nair&#x27;s fiction, as a presence and as a symbol, endorsing this view. The staple locale of his fiction is the Valluvanadan village. The landscape and ethos of the Valluvanad region and the transformations undergone by them in the course of the century, involving relics of the tarawad and the communal tensions provide a challenging theme for the highly evocative style of Vasudevan Nair&#x27;s narrative art. The temporal milieu of Nair&#x27;s fiction stretches over the second half of the twentieth century, a period of tremendous social, cultural and economic changes.

It was in the sixties that Nair rose to prominence as a writer. The phase of social realism had come to an end. In his opinion, class-war the ideal which had inspired the writers belonging to the preceding generation had almost lost its relevance by the time he entered the literary career. The prominent Malayalam writers of the pre-independence phase—Thakazhi, Vallathol and Kesavadev—were all stimulated by the progressive leftist ideals. They focussed their attention on social conflict as the theme for their writings—Conflict between capital and labour, between the landlord and the tenant, between the oppressor and the oppressed. Nair felt that this theme of conflict was an outdated phenomenon in the context of present Kerala. The protagonists of Nair are men out of society and at war with themselves, a sharp contrast to the heroes of Kesavadev or Thakazhi who fight a losing war against the hostile forces in the society. Nair, in spite of his broad and deep sympathy for the marginalised, doesn&#x27;t identify himself with any particular political ideology or movement.

==Personal life and death ==
Nair married twice. He first married writer and translator Prameela in 1965. They separated after 11 years of marriage. He had a daughter from this marriage, Sithara, who works as a business executive in the United States.

In 1977 he married dance artist Kalamandalam Saraswathi, with whom he had a daughter, dancer Aswathy Nair.

Nair resided in &quot;Sithara&quot;, Kottaram Road, Kozhikode, named after his eldest daughter.

He died on 25 December 2024, at the age of 91. He had been admitted to Baby Memorial Hospital in Kozhikode on 15 December due to breathing difficulties. Despite medical intervention, his condition worsened, and he suffered a cardiac arrest, leading to his death.

==Recognition, awards, and honours==
Nair is regarded as one of the masters of post-Independence Indian literature.

He was bestowed with honorary D. Litt. degree by the Calicut University and Mahatma Gandhi University.

As of 2016 the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., United States, had a collection of 62 books authored by Nair (including some English translations) or about him.

<text>Captain Edward Stephen Fogarty Fegen, (8 October 1891 – 5 November 1940) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Edward Stephen Fogarty Fegen was born into a naval family, one of four children his father being Vice-Admiral F. F. Fegen MVO. He was born at 42 Nightingale Rd, Southsea, Hampshire, on 8 October 1891. At the age of 12, he entered Osborne Royal Naval College and in 1909, he was appointed Midshipman on HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.

==First World War==
On 24 March 1918, while the British ship SS &quot;War Knight&quot; was proceeding up the English Channel in convoy, she collided with the United States oil carrier &quot;O.B. Jennings&quot;. It appears that the naphtha, which was on board the latter vessel, ignited, and the two ships and surrounding water were soon enveloped in flames. The master of &quot;O.B. Jennings&quot; gave orders that all the ship&#x27;s available boats should be lowered, those on the starboard side were burnt, and the crew abandoned the ship in the port boats, whilst the master, chief engineer, chief officer and three others remained on board. HMS Garland, under the command of Lieutenant Fegen, with other destroyers, were proceeding to the spot to render assistance, when it was seen that one boat which had been lowered from &quot;O.B. Jennings&quot; had been swamped. &quot;Garland&quot; closed with &quot;O.B. Jennings&quot;, rescued the men from the swamped boat, and then proceeded alongside the ship, which was still blazing, and rescued those who were still on board. She afterwards proceeded to pick up the others who had left the ship in boats, rescuing in all four officers and twenty-two men. Lieutenant Fegen handled his ship in a very able manner under difficult conditions during the rescue of the survivors, while Quartermaster Driscoll worked the helm and saw that all orders to the engine-room were correctly carried out, and his actions during this rescue resulted in both being awarded Silver Sea Gallantry Medals.

==Interwar service==
A little later in his naval career, Fegen was seconded to the Royal Australian Navy, and during 1928–29, served as executive officer in the Royal Australian Naval College, which was located on Jervis Bay on the south coast of New South Wales. By coincidence, the vessel on which he later achieved fame (and death) was named after this bay.

==Second World War==
He was 49 years old, and an acting captain in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5 November 1940 in the Atlantic, Captain Fegen, commanding the armed merchantman , was escorting 38 ships of Convoy HX 84, when they were attacked by the German heavy cruiser (often termed a &quot;pocket battleship&quot;). Captain Fegen immediately engaged the enemy head-on, thus giving the ships of the convoy time to scatter. Out-gunned and on fire &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; maintained the unequal fight for 22 minutes, although the captain&#x27;s right arm was shattered, and even after he died when the bridge was shot from under him. He went down with his ship but 31 ships of the convoy managed to escape – including .

He was remembered in Winston Churchill&#x27;s broadcast speech on 13 May 1945 &quot;Five years of War&quot;, as having defended Ireland&#x27;s honour:
The citation for Fegen&#x27;s Victoria Cross was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 22 November 1940, reading:
==In popular culture==
Issue #47 of the comic book &quot;Hitman&quot; by Garth Ennis and John McCrea contains a fictionalized account of Fegen&#x27;s last battle and the sinking of the &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;.

<doc id="872840" wikidata="Q3552193" url="?curid=872840" title="Urban Outfitters">
<text>Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN) is a multinational lifestyle retail corporation headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operating in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, select Western European countries, Poland, soon to operate in African countries, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, and Qatar, the Urban Outfitters brand targets young adults with a merchandise mix of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s fashion apparel, footwear, beauty and wellness products, accessories, activewear and gear, and housewares, as well as music, primarily vinyl records and cassettes.

The company was founded as the retail store Free People by Richard Hayne, Judy Wicks and Scott Belair in 1970 as a project for an entrepreneurship class at University of Pennsylvania. It was renamed to Urban Outfitters and incorporated in 1976.

Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN) carries multiple stores within the URBN portfolio of brands, which also includes Anthropologie, Free People, Terrain, BHLDN and the Vetri Family restaurant group. Much of the merchandise is designed and produced by the company&#x27;s wholesale division on these multiple private labels.

==Corporate history==

In the 1970s, Dick Hayne opened a store and called it Free People in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the store eventually grew from one to two storefronts, the name was changed from Free People to Urban Outfitters.

In 2007, the company received the National Preservation Honor Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation for the Urban Outfitters Corporate Office Campus located on the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

In 2011, it agreed to sell limited editions of Polaroid ONE600 instant cameras and Type 779 instant film in partnership with the Austrian entrepreneur Florian Kaps, who acquired the rights to manufacture 700 copies of the defunct product. In January 2013, it hired the Abraham &amp; Roetzel lobbying firm, led by former Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham, to advocate on its behalf in Washington, D.C., regarding retail industry policy.

In Q4 2015, the company announced plans to acquire the Vetri Family, a Philadelphia restaurant group. As the company was facing declining same store sales and foot traffic, the acquisition illustrated the retailer&#x27;s shift in strategy. This includes restaurants Amis Trattoria, Bar Amis, and Pizzeria Vetri. There are two Pizzeria Vetri locations in Philadelphia, with other locations in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Devon, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.

In 2019, the company drew attention by announcing the sale of used VHS tapes for $40. In the same year, Urban Outfitters launched Nuuly, a subscription clothing rental service. Following that, the company launched Nuuly Thrift, a resale platform for buying and selling women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s and kids’ apparel and accessories from URBN labels and other brands.

As of 2020, Urban Outfitters does not publicly disclose which factories produce the brand&#x27;s clothing. It also has no human resources department.

In December 2022, Urban Outfitters announced the departure of its president, Francis Pierrel, from the company.

== Criticism ==
Urban Outfitters&#x27; products have also been the subject of multiple complaints and criticism, largely from religious, ethical, and ethnic pressure groups including a local chapter of the NAACP, Anti-Defamation League and Navajo Nation for some of their products.

In January 2007, URBN stopped selling keffiyehs after Jewish blogging site &quot;Jewschool&quot; called out the company for describing the item as an “anti-war woven scarf&quot;.

===Labor practices===

On November 27, 2009, URBN drew the attention of the Swedish press for denying collective bargaining rights to employees at their Stockholm store by making all 38 workers redundant and re-hiring them through employment agency Academic Work. In response to the move, ombudsman Jimmy Ekman called for tougher laws to prevent other firms denying collective bargaining rights in this way.

In 2019, a former executive of Chinese descent with 40 years at the company sued it for ethnic and age-based discrimination. 

In 2021, the company only received a score of 11-20% in the Fashion Transparency Index. There is also no evidence of Urban Outfitters ensuring the paying of living wages to their employees.

<doc id="872847" wikidata="Q166268" url="?curid=872847" title="SCO–Linux disputes">
<text>In a series of legal disputes between SCO Group and Linux vendors and users, SCO alleged that its license agreements with IBM meant that source code IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO&#x27;s contractual rights. Members of the Linux community disagreed with SCO&#x27;s claims; IBM, Novell, and Red Hat filed claims against SCO.

On August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; ruled on summary judgment that Novell, not the SCO Group, was the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that &quot;SCO is obligated to recognize Novell&#x27;s waiver of SCO&#x27;s claims against IBM and Sequent&quot;. After the ruling, Novell announced they had no interest in suing people over Unix and stated &quot;We don&#x27;t believe there is Unix in Linux&quot;. The final district court ruling, on November 20, 2008, affirmed the summary judgment, and added interest payments and a constructive trust.

On August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reversed the district court judgment. The appeals court remanded back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell&#x27;s contractual waiver rights. The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.

On March 30, 2010, following a jury trial, Novell, and not The SCO Group, was unanimously found to be the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights. The SCO Group, through bankruptcy trustee Edward Cahn, decided to continue the lawsuit against IBM for causing a decline in SCO revenues.

On March 1, 2016, SCO&#x27;s lawsuit against IBM was dismissed with prejudice; SCO filed an appeal later that month.

==Overview==
Unix is a major computer operating system, developed in the United States of America. Prior to the events of this case, the intellectual property rights (IP) in Unix were held by Unix System Laboratories (USL), part of AT&amp;T, but the area of IP ownership was complex. By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also, some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the Copyright Act of 1976, or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The software company SCO Group (SCO), formerly Caldera International, asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other Unix-type operating systems—particularly the free operating system Linux and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies—were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.

SCO initially claimed, and tried to assert, a legal means to litigate directly against all end-users of these operating systems, as well as the companies or groups providing them—potentially a very substantial case and one that would throw fear into the market about using them. However, it was unable to formulate such a case, since the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets. Lacking grounds to sue all users generally, SCO dropped this aspect of its cases.

The assertions were heavily contested. Claims of SCO&#x27;s own copyright violations of these other systems were raised, along with claims related to SCO being bound by, or violating, the GPL licence, under which SCO conducted business related to these systems. Claims were also made that the case was substantially financed and promoted by Microsoft and investment businesses with links to Microsoft; around that time (1998–2004 onwards), Microsoft was fiercely engaged in various FUD tactics such as its &quot;Get the facts&quot; campaign, that sought to undermine or discredit Linux as a possible competitor to its own Windows operating systems and server systems.

In the end, SCO launched only a few main legal cases—against IBM for improper disclosure and breach of copyright related to its AIX operating system, against Novell for interference (clouding the issue of ownership), against DaimlerChrysler for non-compliance with a demand to certify certain matters related to Unix usage, and against Linux business and former client AutoZone for violating SCO&#x27;s rights by using Linux. Separately, the Linux company Red Hat also filed a legal claim against SCO for making false claims that affected its (Red Hat&#x27;s) business, and to seek a court declaration that SCO had no ownership rights in Linux code.

In 2007, a court ruled in &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; that Novell and not SCO was the owner of the Unix copyrights. , most of these cases have been resolved, or largely resolved, and none of the rulings have been in SCO&#x27;s favor.

==Timeline and major cases==

At the beginning of 2003, SCO claimed that there had been &quot;misappropriation of its UNIX System V code into Linux&quot;. However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the SMP, RCU and a few other parts of the Linux kernel.

On 6 March 2003, they announced that they were suing IBM for $1 billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO trade secrets into Linux. That amount later rose to $3 billion, and then again to $5 billion. Later that year in May 2003, Novell stated publicly that it owned the AT&amp;T Unix intellectual property which SCO claimed IBM violated, a statement which if true would have demolished SCO&#x27;s infringement suit.

Some educated parties note that the &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot; case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT&amp;T or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which, after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially, a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.

SCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Novell, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Red Hat.

By mid-2004, five major lawsuits had been filed:

* &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;
* &quot;Red Hat v. SCO&quot;
* &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; (not directly related to Linux, the suit has more to do with Unix copyrights)
* &quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot;
* &quot;SCO v. AutoZone&quot;

In cases, SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers, but also Linux users.

==UNIX SVRx==
SCO&#x27;s claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets. The UNIX IP rights originated with Unix System Laboratories (USL), a division of AT&amp;T. In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to Novell, including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell&#x27;s development work, were then sold to the Santa Cruz Operation in 1995. The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to Caldera Systems, which later reorganized into Caldera International and changed its name to SCO Group.

Through this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the &quot;owner of UNIX&quot;. The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as SVRx, and licensing contracts originating with AT&amp;T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the &quot;Asset Purchase Agreement&quot;, defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree.

===UNIX copyrights ownership===
The status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories. Some code was released without copyright notice before the Copyright Act of 1976 made copyright automatic. This code may be in the public domain and not subject to copyright claims. Other code is affected by the &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot; case, and is covered by the BSD License.

Groklaw uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot;. This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the university for making BSD source code freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university&#x27;s copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO&#x27;s ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO&#x27;s claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.

Novell challenges SCO&#x27;s interpretation of the purchase agreement. In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003, Novell exchanged a series of letters with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell. In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office.

In response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a &quot;slander of title&quot; suit against Novell, &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;. This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO&#x27;s claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004, for &quot;failure to specifically plead special damages.&quot; However, SCO was given 30 days &quot;to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages&quot;. In the same ruling, the judge stated that it was questionable whether or not the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of &quot;seller hereby conveys to buyer&quot; and that it used ambiguous language when it came to the question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.

SCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO&#x27;s complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation&#x27;s Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell&#x27;s counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO&#x27;s cash is diminishing quickly.

Novell also retained the right to audit SCO&#x27;s Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun, and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO&#x27;s Unix Business.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; case, ruled that &quot;the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights&quot;.

===License administration standing===
The Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners. These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO&#x27;s claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO–Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM&#x27;s license, the second was SCO&#x27;s complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see &quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot;), and the third is the derivative works claim of the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case.

In May 2003, SCO canceled IBM&#x27;s SVRx license to its version of UNIX, AIX. This was based on SCO&#x27;s claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license made it &quot;irrevocable&quot;. In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO&#x27;s behalf in some cases. Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO&#x27;s cancellation of the IBM license. SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM&#x27;s continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license.

In December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language. Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the &quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot; suit in March 2004. All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court.

===Control of derivative works===
The third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO&#x27;s claims of control of derivative works.

Many UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a derivative work. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code.

These claims are the basis of &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;. SCO&#x27;s initial complaint, said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project.

IBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985) and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer&#x27;s property. This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code. In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.

===SCO allegations of copyright and trade secret violations===
SCO claims that Linux infringes SCO&#x27;s copyright, trade secrets, and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the SCOsource program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; lawsuit.

SCO originally claimed in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO&#x27;s trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.

SCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation. SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included.

These examples have fallen into two groups. The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the errno.h header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and Dynix, IBM&#x27;s two UNIX products.

Each of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material.

====SVRx code allegedly in Linux====
The issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed above. Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain.

SCO&#x27;s first public disclosure of what they claimed is infringing code was at its SCO Forum conference in August 2003 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. The first, known as the Berkeley Packet Filter, was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone. The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released under the BSD License. It is no longer in the Linux code base.

SCO has also claimed that code related to application programming interfaces was copied from UNIX. However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to The Open Group. A later claim was made to code segments related to ELF file format standards. This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain. SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO&#x27;s predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.

SCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux. They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases. The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below). The Novell case is about copyright ownership. DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements.

The &quot;may or may not&quot; comes from AutoZone&#x27;s case. In AutoZone, SCO&#x27;s complaint claimed damages for AutoZone&#x27;s use of Linux. However, when objecting to AutoZone&#x27;s request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO&#x27;s original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries. AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries. If SCO&#x27;s oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors.

The copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;. The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities. It is also addressed by Red Hat in the &quot;Red Hat v. SCO&quot; case. Red Hat claims that SCO&#x27;s statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the Lanham Act. Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof. They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights. A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold.

====Allegations of reverse copying====
&quot;EWeek&quot; has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature. If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.

====IBM code in Linux====
SCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), Journaled File System (JFS), Read-copy-update (RCU) and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel, and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.

SCO claims that they have &quot;control rights&quot; to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their &quot;control rights&quot; to an easement, rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at Control of derivative works.

===SCO and the GPL===
Before changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as Caldera International.

Caldera was one of the major distributors of Linux between 1994 and 1998. In August 1998, the company split into Caldera Systems and Caldera Thin Clients, with Caldera Systems taking over the Linux systems business and Caldera Thin Clients concentrating on the Thin Clients and embedded business. The parent and shell company Caldera, Inc. ceased to exist in 2000 after a settlement with Microsoft in the &quot;Caldera v. Microsoft&quot; lawsuit.

Caldera Systems was reorganized to become Caldera International in 2001, the company, which was renamed to The SCO Group in 2002.

Some, like Eben Moglen, have suggested that because Caldera distributed the allegedly infringing code under the GNU General Public License (GPL), that this act would license any proprietary code in Linux.

SCO has stated that they did not know their own code was in Linux, so releasing it under the GPL does not count. However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO&#x27;s claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.

SCO has also claimed, in early stages of the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and non-binding and legally unenforceable. In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO&#x27;s right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license. Later court filings by the SCO Group in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; use SCO&#x27;s alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM&#x27;s counterclaims.

The GPL has become an issue in &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;. Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM&#x27;s code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to &quot;accept&quot; the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL&#x27;s validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws. IBM also claims that SCO&#x27;s SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM&#x27;s copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM&#x27;s copyrighted material.

==Status of current lawsuits==

===&quot;SCO v. IBM&quot;===

On March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM&#x27;s continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO Group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law.

On February 8, 2005, Judge Kimball ruled that IBM&#x27;s motions for summary judgment were premature but added:
Viewed against the backdrop of SCO&#x27;s plethora of public statements concerning IBM&#x27;s and others&#x27; infringement of SCO&#x27;s purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO&#x27;s alleged copyrights through IBM&#x27;s Linux activities.

On June 28, 2006, Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM&#x27;s motion to limit SCO&#x27;s claims and excluded 186 of SCO&#x27;s 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons). Wells cited a number of factors including SCO&#x27;s inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims:
In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, &quot;identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM.&quot; Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed &quot;the basis of their action against IBM.&quot; At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball’s order entered in July 2005.

This left about 100 of SCO&#x27;s items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO.

Following the partial summary judgment rulings in the &quot;SCO v. Novell&quot; Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007, a statement of the status of this case.

In 2021, the case finally ended in a settlement.

===&quot;Red Hat v. SCO&quot;===

Red Hat filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO&#x27;s copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case.

===&quot;SCO v. Novell&quot;===

After SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of UNIX. Novell claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004. Novell removed the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.

On July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO&#x27;s claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a &quot;constructive trust&quot; in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company&#x27;s assets were depleting rapidly.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that &quot;the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights&quot;. Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball&#x27;s ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.

On July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was not authorized to enter into the 2003 agreement with Sun. On November 20, 2008, final judgment in the case affirmed the August 10 ruling, and added interest of $918,122 plus $489 per diem after August 29, 2008, along with a constructive trust of $625,486.90.

On August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reversed the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment ruling. The appeals court remanded back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell&#x27;s contractual waiver rights. The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement. On March 30, 2010, after a three-week trial before Judge Ted Stewart, a jury returned a verdict &quot;confirming Novell&#x27;s ownership of the Unix copyrights.&quot;

On June 10, 2010, Judge Ted Stewart denied SCO&#x27;s motion for another trial and ruled for Novell on all remaining issues.

On July 7, 2010, SCO appealed the new judgments to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

On August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court ruling in its entirety, rejecting SCO&#x27;s attempt to re-argue the case before the Court of Appeals.

===&quot;SCO v. AutoZone&quot;===
AutoZone, a corporate user of Linux and former user of SCO OpenServer, was sued by SCO on March 3, 2004. SCO claims AutoZone violated SCO&#x27;s copyrights by using Linux. The suit was stayed pending the resolution of the IBM, Red Hat and Novell cases.

On September 26, 2008, Judge Robert C. Jones lifted the stay, effective December 31, 2008. He initially scheduled discovery for April 9, 2010. SCO filed an amended complaint on August 14, 2009. On August 31, 2009, AutoZone replied, and filed a motion to dismiss in part.

On October 22, 2009, Edward Cahn, SCO&#x27;s Chapter 11 trustee, sought bankruptcy court approval for an agreement he reached with AutoZone. According to the court filings, the confidential settlement resolves all claims between SCO and AutoZone.

===&quot;SCO v. DaimlerChrysler&quot;===

In December 2003, SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. DaimlerChrysler, a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004, SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment. The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler.

==Other issues and conflicts==

===SCO announces that it will not sue its own customers===
On June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers. In the letter, it states:

===SCO and SGI===
In August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples (Berkeley Packet Filter) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, Silicon Graphics. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that:

* The code originated from an even older version of UNIX which at some point was published by Caldera, thus making any claim of copyright infringement shaky.
* The code did not do anything. It was in a part of the Linux kernel that was written in anticipation of a Silicon Graphics architecture that was never released.
* It had already been removed from the kernel two months earlier.
* The contested segment was small (80 lines) and trivial.

===SCO and BayStar Capital===
In October 2003, BayStar Capital and Royal Bank of Canada invested US$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO&#x27;s Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by Microsoft, whose proprietary Windows operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of Microsoft, according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: &quot;It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda&quot;.

On April 22, 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that BayStar Capital, a private hedge fund which had arranged for $50M in funding for SCO in October 2003, was asking for its $20M back. The remainder of the $50M was from Royal Bank of Canada. SCO stated in their press release that they believed that BayStar did not have grounds for making this demand.

On August 27, 2004, SCO and BayStar resolved their dispute.

===SCO and Canopy Group===
The Canopy Group is an investment group with shares in a trust of different companies. It is a group owned by the Noorda family, also founders of Novell.

Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member Ralph Yarro III on claims of misappropriation. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy&#x27;s director of information systems, Robert Penrose, and Val Kriedel, the daughter of Ray Noorda), the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.

SCO and Canopy Group are now mostly independent, though SCO continues to rent their Utah office space from Canopy.

===Microsoft funding of SCO controversy===
On March 4, 2004, a leaked SCO internal e-mail detailed how Microsoft had raised up to $106 million via the BayStar referral and other means. Blake Stowell of SCO confirmed the memo was real, but claimed it to be &quot;a misunderstanding&quot;. BayStar claimed the deal was suggested by Microsoft, but that no money for it came directly from them.
In addition to the Baystar involvement, Microsoft paid SCO $6M (USD) in May 2003 for a license to &quot;Unix and Unix-related patents&quot;, despite the lack of Unix-related patents owned by SCO. License deals between both companies may have reached at least $16M (USD) according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. This deal was widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO&#x27;s finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM.

===SCOsource===
After their initial claim of copyright infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sold licenses to SCO&#x27;s claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor running Linux. SCO said that participants of the SCOsource initiative were not liable for any claims that SCO made against Linux users.

===The Michael Davidson E-Mail===
On July 14, 2005, an email was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera International employees) in 2002, before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because &quot;(spelling as in the original)&quot;:
The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was &quot;a waste of time&quot;. After 4 to 6 months of consultant&#x27;s work, Davidson says:

<doc id="872850" wikidata="Q899004" url="?curid=872850" title="Heterocyst">
<text>Heterocysts or heterocytes are specialized nitrogen-fixing cells formed during nitrogen starvation by some filamentous cyanobacteria, such as &quot;Nostoc&quot;, &quot;Cylindrospermum&quot;, and &quot;Anabaena&quot;. They fix nitrogen from dinitrogen (N2) in the air using the enzyme nitrogenase, in order to provide the cells in the filament with nitrogen for biosynthesis. 

Nitrogenase is inactivated by oxygen, so the heterocyst must create a microanaerobic environment. The heterocysts&#x27; unique structure and physiology require a global change in gene expression. For example, heterocysts:

* produce three additional cell walls, including one of glycolipid that forms a hydrophobic barrier to oxygen
* produce nitrogenase and other proteins involved in nitrogen fixation
* degrade photosystem II, which produces oxygen
* up-regulate glycolytic enzymes
* produce proteins that scavenge any remaining oxygen
* contain polar plugs composed of cyanophycin which slows down cell-to-cell diffusion

Cyanobacteria usually obtain a fixed carbon (carbohydrate) by photosynthesis. The lack of water-splitting in photosystem II prevents heterocysts from performing photosynthesis, so the vegetative cells provide them with carbohydrates, which is thought to be sucrose. The fixed carbon and nitrogen sources are exchanged through channels between the cells in the filament. Heterocysts maintain photosystem I, allowing them to generate ATP by cyclic photophosphorylation.

Single heterocysts develop about every 9-15 cells, producing a one-dimensional pattern along the filament. The interval between heterocysts remains approximately constant even though the cells in the filament are dividing. The bacterial filament can be seen as a multicellular organism with two distinct yet interdependent cell types. Such behavior is highly unusual in prokaryotes and may have been the first example of multicellular patterning in evolution. Once a heterocyst has formed it cannot revert to a vegetative cell. Certain heterocyst-forming bacteria can differentiate into spore-like cells called akinetes or motile cells called hormogonia, making them the most phenotypically versatile of all prokaryotes.

==Gene expression==
In low nitrogen environments, heterocyst differentiation is triggered by the transcriptional regulator NtcA. NtcA influences heterocyst differentiation by signaling proteins involved in the process of heterocyst differentiation. For instance, NtcA controls the expression of several genes, including HetR, which is crucial for heterocyst differentiation as it up-regulates other genes such as hetR, patS, and hepA by binding to their promoter and thus acting as a transcription factor. It is also worthy to note that the expression of ntcA and HetR are dependent on each other and their presence promotes heterocyst differentiation even in the presence of nitrogen. It has also been recently found that other genes such as PatA and hetP regulate heterocyst differentiation. PatA patterns the heterocysts along the filaments, and it is also important for cell division. PatS influences the heterocyst patterning by inhibiting heterocyst differentiation when a group of differentiating cells come together to form a pro- heterocyst (immature heterocyst). Heterocyst maintenance is dependent on an enzyme called hetN. Heterocyst formation is inhibited by the presence of a fixed nitrogen source, such as ammonium or nitrate.

==Heterocyst formation==
The following sequences take place in formation of heterocysts from a vegetative cell:
*The cell enlarges.
*Granular inclusions decrease.
*Photosynthetic lammel reorients.
*The wall finally becomes triple-layered. These three layers develop outside the cell&#x27;s outer layer.
**The middle layer is homogeneous.
**The inner layer is laminated.
*The senescent heterocyst undergoes vacuolation and finally breaks off from the filament causing fragmentation. These fragments are called hormogonia (singular hormogonium) and undergo asexual reproduction.

The cyanobacteria that form heterocysts are divided into the orders Nostocales and Stigonematales, which form simple and branching filaments respectively. Together they form a monophyletic group, with very low genetic variability.

== Symbiotic relationships ==
The bacteria may also enter a symbiotic relationship with certain plants. In such a relationship, the bacteria do not respond to the availability of nitrogen, but to signals produced by the plant for heterocyst differentiation. Up to 60% of the cells can become heterocysts, providing fixed nitrogen to the plant in return for fixed carbon. The signal produced by the plant and the stage of heterocyst differentiation it affects is unknown. Presumably, the symbiotic signal generated by the plant acts before NtcA activation as hetR is required for symbiotic heterocyst differentiation. For the symbiotic association with the plant, ntcA is needed as bacteria with mutated ntcA cannot infect plants.

=== &quot;Anabaena-Azolla&quot; ===
A notable symbiotic relationship is that of &quot;Anabaena azollae&quot; cyanobacteria with &quot;Azolla&quot; plants. &quot;Anabaena&quot; reside on the stems and within leaves of &quot;Azolla&quot; plants. The &quot;Azolla&quot; plant undergoes photosynthesis and provides fixed carbon for the &quot;Anabaena&quot; to use as an energy source for dinitrogenases in the heterocyst cells. In return, the heterocysts are able to provide the vegetative cells and the &quot;Azolla&quot; plant with fixed nitrogen in the form of ammonia which supports growth of both organisms.

This symbiotic relationship is exploited by humans in agriculture. In Asia, &quot;Azolla&quot; plants containing &quot;Anabaena&quot; species are used as biofertilizer where nitrogen is limiting as well as in animal feed. Different strains of &quot;Azolla-Anabaena&quot; are suited for different environments and may lead to differences in crop production. Rice crops grown with &quot;Azolla-Anabaena&quot; as biofertilizer have been shown to result in a much greater quantity and quality of produce compared to crops without the cyanobacteria. &quot;Azolla-Anabaena&quot; plants are grown before and after rice crops are planted. As the &quot;Azolla-Anabaena&quot; plants grow, they accumulate fixed nitrogen due to the actions of the nitrogenase enzymes and organic carbon from photosynthesis by the &quot;Azolla&quot; plants and &quot;Anabaena&quot; vegetative cells. When the &quot;Azolla-Anabaena&quot; plants die and decompose, they release high amounts of fixed nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon, and many other nutrients into the soil, providing a rich environment ideal for the growth of rice crops.

The &quot;Anabaena&quot;-&quot;Azolla&quot; relationship has also been explored as a possible method of removing pollutants from the environment, a process known as phytoremediation. &quot;Anabaena sp.&quot; together with &quot;Azolla&quot; &quot;caroliniana&quot; has been shown to be successful in removing uranium, a toxic pollutant caused by mining, as well as the heavy metals mercury(II), chromium(III), and chromium(VI) from contaminated waste water.

<doc id="872854" wikidata="Q156292" url="?curid=872854" title="Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Brühl">
<text>The Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces form a historical building complex in Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The buildings are connected by the spacious gardens and trees of the Schlosspark. Built in the early 18th century, the palaces and adjoining gardens are considered masterpieces of early rococo architecture and have been listed as a UNESCO cultural World Heritage Site since 1984. Augustusburg Palace () and its parks also serve as a venue for the Brühl Palace Concerts.

== History ==
The Augustusburg Castle was built on the foundations of a medieval castle in 1725. It was planned and funded by Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Clemens August of Bavaria of the Wittelsbach family, and designed by the architects Johann Conrad Schlaun and François de Cuvilliés. Shortly thereafter, François de Cuvilliés designed the Falkenlust hunting lodge to the southeast for Clemens August to practice falconry, and the lodge was built from 1729 to 1740.

The elaborate gardens surrounding the Augustusburg palace were designed by Dominique Girard. An elaborate parterre for an area south of the palaces was also designed, but it was restructured by Peter Joseph Lenné in the 19th century and turned into a landscape garden. Attempts to renovate the area have proven difficult, due to poor source material availability.

From shortly after World War II until 1994, Augustusburg was used as a reception hall for guests of state by the German President, as it is not far from Bonn, which was the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany at that time.

== Description ==
The palace complex consists of the Augustusburg Palace and the smaller Falkenlust lodge roughly 1 mile to the southeast. The main block of Augustusburg Palace is a U-shaped building with three main storeys and two levels of attics. The three wings are made of brick with a roughcast plaster. Two orangeries adjoin the main building on the north and south sides. The magnificent main staircase was designed by Johann Balthasar Neumann and made of ornate marble, jasper and stucco. The main garden directly south of the Augustusburg Palace is a complex, embroidery-like parterre, with four fountains and a mirror pool, flanked by alleys lined with lime trees. A path runs diagonally south from this garden to the Falkenlust lodge.

The Falkenlust lodge was built in the style of a country home, drawing inspiration from the Amalienburg hunting lodge in the park of Nymphenburg Palace. The main building has two floors, flanked by two single-story buildings that housed the prince-elector&#x27;s falcons. On the ground floor is an oval salon.

<text>Dame Kathleen Mary Ollerenshaw, (&quot;née&quot; Timpson; 1 October 1912 – 10 August 2014) was a British mathematician and politician who was Lord Mayor of Manchester from 1975 to 1976 and an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government in the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
She was born Kathleen Mary Timpson in Withington, Manchester, where she attended Lady Barn House School (1918–26). She was a grandchild of the founder of the Timpson shoe repair business, who had moved to Manchester from Kettering and established the business there by 1870. She became fascinated with mathematics, inspired by the Lady Barn headmistress, Miss Jenkin Jones. While at Lady Barn, she met her future husband, Robert Ollerenshaw.

Ollerenshaw became completely deaf at age eight and was taught to lip read. She gravitated toward the study of mathematics as it is not dependent on hearing. She was further inspired by a headmistress at Lady Barn House School who studied mathematics at Cambridge.

As a young woman, she attended St Leonards School and Sixth Form College in St Andrews, Scotland where today the house of young male boarders is named after her. At the age of 19 she gained admittance to Somerville College, Oxford, to study mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Somerville in 1945 on &quot;Critical Lattices&quot; under the supervision of Theo Chaundy. She wrote five original research papers which were sufficient for her to earn her DPhil degree without the need of a formal written thesis.

While an undergraduate, she became engaged to Robert Ollerenshaw, who became a distinguished military surgeon (Colonel R.G.W. Ollerenshaw, ERD, TD, BM, DMRD) and a pioneer of medical illustration. They married in September 1939 and had two children, Charles (1941–99) and Florence (1946–72). In 1942 she suffered a miscarriage and &quot;cried nonstop for three days&quot; as a result of stress when her husband was posted abroad for front-line war service.

==Career==
After the Second World War, the Ollerenshaws moved to Manchester, where Kathleen worked as a part-time lecturer in the mathematics department at Manchester University while raising her children and continued her work on lattices. In 1949, at the age of 37, she received her first effective hearing aid. 
Outside of academia, Ollerenshaw served as a Conservative Councillor for Rusholme for twenty-five years (1954–79), a member of the city council&#x27;s finance committee (1968–71), a chairman of the education committee of the Association of Municipal Corporations (1967–71), Lord Mayor of Manchester (1975–76), High Sheriff of Greater Manchester from 1978 to 1979, and the prime motivator in the creation of the Royal Northern College of Music. She was made a Freeman of the City of Manchester and was an advisor on educational matters to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government in the 1980s.

She was President of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications from 1978 to 1979. She published at least 26 mathematical papers, her best-known contribution being to most-perfect pandiagonal magic squares. Upon her death, she left a legacy in trust to support distinguished research visitors and public engagement activities at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester. An annual public lecture at the university is named in her honour.
An amateur astronomer, Ollerenshaw donated her telescope to Lancaster University, and an observatory there bears her name. She was an honorary member of the Manchester Astronomical Society and held the post of vice-president for a number of years.

Ollerenshaw attended St Leonards School in St Andrews, Fife, and served as the school&#x27;s president from 1981 to 2003. She was succeeded by Baroness Byford, Conservative spokeswoman in the House of Lords. She turned 100 in October 2012.

She died in Didsbury on 10 August 2014, at the age of 101. Her husband and both their children had predeceased her.

==Honours and legacy==
* In 1970, Ollerenshaw was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to education.
* Composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davies dedicated his Naxos Quartet No.9 to her.

<text> () is a short, non-narrative &quot;ballet blanc&quot; to piano music by Frédéric Chopin, selected and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. 

The ballet, described as a &quot;romantic reverie&quot;, is frequently cited as the first ballet to be simply about mood and dance. has no plot but instead consists of several white-clad sylphs dancing in the moonlight with the &quot;poet&quot; or &quot;young man&quot; dressed in white tights and a black tunic.

Its original choreography was by Michel Fokine, with Chopin&#x27;s music orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Glazunov had already set some of the music in 1892 as a purely orchestral suite, under the title Chopiniana, Op. 46. In that form, it was introduced to the public in December 1893, conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

==Performance history==

Identifying the premiere of the fuller ballet poses a challenge. One might say that it premiered in 1907 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg as &quot;Rêverie Romantique: Ballet sur la musique de Chopin&quot;. However, this also formed the basis of a ballet, &quot;Chopiniana&quot;, which took different forms, even in Fokine&#x27;s hands. As , what we consider the work was premiered by Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes on 2 June 1909 at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. The Diaghilev premiere is the most famous, as its soloists were Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky (as the poet, dreamer, or young man), Anna Pavlova, and Alexandra Baldina. The long white tutu that Pavlova originally danced in, and that the entire female &quot;corps de ballet&quot; adopted soon after, was designed by Léon Bakst and inspired by a lithograph of Marie Taglioni dressed as a sylph.

The London premiere, in the first season of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, was at the Royal Opera House. With more sylph-like elusiveness, the North American premiere might be dated by an unauthorized version in the Winter Garden, New York, on 14 June 1911 (featuring Baldina alone from the Diaghilev cast). However, its authorized premiere on that continent, by Diaghilev Ballets Russes, was at the Century Theater, New York City, 20 January 1916, with Lydia Lopokova (who also featured in the unauthorized production five years earlier). Nijinsky danced it with that company at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 April 1916, where it was paired with a similar work to a piano suite (by Robert Schumann), &quot;Papillons&quot;, also choreographed by Fokine. Fokine also set the ballet for several other companies, and he and his wife, Vera Fokina, danced its leading roles themselves for some years.

==Revision history==

===Original production===

&quot;Chopiniana&quot;, staged by Fokine, had a different musical composition. Also, &quot;Chopiniana&quot; was originally a compilation of dramatic or character dances set to Chopin&#x27;s piano music. The Glazunov suite upon which this original version was based had only four Chopin pieces; Fokine wanted to use a waltz as an addition to the suite and was able to get Glazunov to orchestrate this to create his ballet, also called &quot;Chopiniana&quot;.

# Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1
# Nocturne in F major, Op. 15, No. 1
# Mazurka in C minor, Op. 50, No. 3
# Waltz in C minor, Op. 64, No. 2, as added by Michel Fokine
# Tarantella in A major, Op. 43

The newly orchestrated waltz would be Fokine&#x27;s inspiration to re-choreograph the ballet into its nearly-final form, selecting different Chopin pieces to go with it and getting these orchestrated by the Maryinsky répétiteur Maurice Keller.

===Ballets Russes production===
When Fokine&#x27;s ballet premiered in Paris as part of Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Saison Russe&quot; in 1909, Diaghilev commissioned re-orchestrations of all the dances, except for the Glazunov-orchestrated Waltz, by Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev, Nikolai Tcherepnin and Igor Stravinsky. This version, now titled &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, was first staged at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 2 June 1909.

===Standard version===
The version of the ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot; includes:

# Polonaise in A major (&quot;Military&quot;), Op. 40, No. 1 (some companies substitute the Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7 instead)
# Nocturne in A major, Op. 32, No. 2
# Waltz in G major, Op. 70, No. 1
# Mazurka in D major, Op. 33, No. 2
# Mazurka in C major, Op. 67, No. 3
# Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7
# Waltz in C minor, Op. 64, No. 2 
# Grande valse brillante in E major, Op. 18

===New York City Ballet production===

The New York City Ballet (NYCB) produced its own staging of the standard version, omitting the Polonaise in A major (and leaving the Prelude in A major in its original position), under the original title, &quot;Chopiniana&quot;. The NYCB premiere was staged by Alexandra Danilova and took place 20 January 1972, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. The original cast included Karin von Aroldingen, Susan Hendl, Kay Mazzo, and Peter Martins.

==Other orchestrations==
A number of musicians have orchestrated the Chopin pieces for major ballet companies, including Maurice Ravel, Benjamin Britten, Alexander Gretchaninov, Roy Douglas, and Gordon Jacob. The Ravel orchestration has been lost. The Britten orchestration was considered lost but a score thought to be his was found in 2013 in the archives of the American Ballet Theatre.

Roy Douglas&#x27;s version has been recorded a number of times, and has largely supplanted the earlier versions. It was written in 1936, to replace what Douglas called &quot;very bad orchestrations of Chopin&#x27;s music&quot;.

<doc id="872869" wikidata="Q586385" url="?curid=872869" title="Battle of Santiago (1962 FIFA World Cup)">
<text>The Battle of Santiago (, ) was a football match during the 1962 FIFA World Cup, played between the hosts Chile and Italy on 2 June 1962 in Santiago. It gained its nickname from the level of violence seen in the game, in which two players were sent off, numerous punches were thrown and police intervention was required four times. The referee was Ken Aston, who later went on to invent yellow and red cards.

==Background==
In this Group B clash, already heightened tensions between the two football teams were exacerbated by the description of Santiago in crude terms by two Italian journalists, and Corrado Pizzinelli; they had written that Santiago was a backwater dump where &quot;the phones don&#x27;t work, taxis are as rare as faithful husbands, a cable to Europe costs an arm and a leg and a letter takes five days to turn up&quot;, and its population as prone to &quot;malnutrition, illiteracy, alcoholism and poverty. Chile is a small, proud and poor country: it has agreed to organise this World Cup in the same way as Mussolini agreed to send our air force to bomb London (they didn&#x27;t arrive). The capital city has 700 hotel beds. Entire neighbourhoods are given over to open prostitution. This country and its people are proudly miserable and backwards.&quot; Chilean newspapers fired back, describing Italians in general as fascists, mafiosos, oversexed, and, because some of Inter Milan&#x27;s players had recently been involved in a doping scandal, drug addicts. The Italian journalists involved were forced to flee Chile, while an Argentinian scribe mistaken for an Italian in a Santiago bar was beaten up and hospitalised.

Chile&#x27;s organisation of and preparation for the tournament had been severely disrupted by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, the strongest earthquake ever recorded in human history. Articles in the Italian papers &quot;La Nazione&quot; and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; were saying that allowing Chile to host the World Cup was &quot;pure madness&quot;; this was used and magnified by local newspapers to inflame the Chilean population. The British newspaper the &quot;Daily Express&quot; wrote &quot;The tournament shows every sign of developing into a violent bloodbath. Reports read like battlefront despatches. Italy vs Germany was described as &#x27;wrestling and warfare.&#x27;&quot;

==Match==

===Summary===

The first foul occurred within 35 seconds of kick-off. Italy&#x27;s Giorgio Ferrini was sent off in the eighth minute after a foul on Honorino Landa, but refused to leave the pitch and had to be dragged off by policemen. In the ensuing scramble, Chilean outside-left Leonel Sánchez broke Humberto Maschio&#x27;s nose with a left hook punch, but English referee Ken Aston did not notice the foul as he was busy telling Ferrini to leave the field. In the 38th minute of the first half, Sánchez slapped Italian right-back Mario David in the face, in retaliation for being fouled seconds earlier. Although the linesman was only a few metres away, Sánchez escaped punishment again. When David attempted to kick Sánchez in the head a few minutes later, he was sent off. The two teams engaged in scuffles and spitting, and police had to intervene three more times.

Chile won the match 2–0, with a headed goal from Jaime Ramírez and a low long-range shot from Jorge Toro, both in the last 16 minutes.

Aston, who had now refereed both of Chile&#x27;s matches, never oversaw a World Cup match again, becoming a senior member of the refereeing committees of the 1966 and 1970 championships.

In his work &quot;The Complete Book of the World Cup&quot; (Harper Sport), Cris Freddi described the match as &quot;…a horror show, the last of the three great World Cup slugfests.&quot; On the same day, Yugoslavia beat Uruguay 3–1 with both teams having a player sent off – Vladimir Popović and Ángel Rubén Cabrera – and Freddi wrote of their opening match against Switzerland: &quot;Chile responded [to conceding an early goal] with some grim tackling, a feature of this World Cup. Aston booked Eschmann then Rojas but should have sent both off when they came to blows a few minutes later.&quot;

===Aftermath===
When highlights from the match were shown on British television a couple of days later (not the same night, because film of matches had to be flown back to the UK), the match was introduced by BBC sports commentator David Coleman as &quot;the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game.&quot; Stones were thrown at some Italian players at their training camp.

Coleman also observed that it was the first meeting between the sides and &quot;we hope it will be the last.&quot; However, the sides were drawn together at the 1966 World Cup and met at Sunderland&#x27;s Roker Park ground with Italy winning 2–0. The rematch also featured unsportsmanlike play but to a lesser degree.

<doc id="872872" wikidata="Q472593" url="?curid=872872" title="Ignatius Kutu Acheampong">
<text>Ignatius Kutu Acheampong ( ; 23 September 1931 – 16 June 1979) was a Ghanaian military officer and politician who was the military head of state of Ghana from 13 January 1972 to 5 July 1978, when he was deposed in a palace coup. He was executed by firing squad on 16 June 1979.

==Early life and education==

Acheampong was born to Catholic parents of Ashanti origin. His parents were James Kwadwo Kutu Acheampong, a Catholic Catechist, and Madam Akua Manu. He attended the Roman Catholic schools at Trabuom and the St Peter&#x27;s school (also Catholic) at Kumasi, both in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. He attended the then Central College of Commerce at Agona Swedru in the Central Region of Ghana.

Acheampong worked as a stenographer/secretary at Timber Sawmill in Kumasi and later taught at Kumasi Commercial College, where he became Vice Principal at Agona-Swedru College of Commerce.

Acheampong trained at Aldershot, England, as a cadet officer. He was commissioned in the Ghana Army in 1959, and served as a member of the UN peacekeepers during the Congo Crisis.

==Politics==

Then commander of Ghana&#x27;s First Infantry Brigade, Acheampong led a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to overthrow the democratically elected government of the Progress Party and its leader Dr Kofi Busia on 13 January 1972. 

He became head of state and chairman of the National Redemption Council (NRC), which was later transformed into the Supreme Military Council on 9 October 1975, with Colonel Acheampong (promoted to General) as its chairman. 

A few months after Acheampong came to power, on 27 April 1972, former president Kwame Nkrumah died in exile. Power in Ghana had changed hands several times since Nkrumah was overthrown, and Acheampong allowed Nkrumah&#x27;s body to be returned and buried on 9 July 1972 at the village of his birth, Nkroful, Ghana. Notable historical changes and events introduced or implemented in Ghana during the period under Acheampong include: the change from the imperial to the metric system of measurement, change from driving on the left to right-hand traffic in &quot;Operation Keep Right&quot;, Operation Feed Yourself (a programme aimed at developing self-reliance in agriculture), &quot;National Reconstruction&quot; (aimed at promoting employment and skill for workers), face-lift projects in cities, and the reconstruction/upgrading of stadia to meet international standards.

There were, however, widespread accusations of both the encouragement and endorsement of corruption in the country under his rule. Also, Ghana began experiencing the troubles it had suffered under previous administrations, with increasing food prices and soaring inflation. Under intense political pressure, Acheampong began in late 1976 to flirt with the idea of a government in which the military could still play a role and proposed a &#x27;Union Government&#x27; with power sharing between civilians and the armed forces. This led to student demonstrations and the closure of universities. Violent clashes between pro and anti-UNIGOV factions led to the death of at least four people in Kumasi.

==Execution==

Following the 4 June 1979 military uprising that brought Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings and the young officers of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) to power, Acheampong was court martialed and executed along with General Edward Kwaku Utuka by firing squad on 16 June. Ten days later, two other former heads of state, Akwasi Afrifa and Fred Akuffo, and senior military officers Joy Amedume, George Boakye, Roger Joseph Felli and Robert Kotei, were executed. The AFRC returned Ghana to civilian rule three months after the uprising.

== Personal life ==

Acheampong was married to Faustina Acheampong. One grandson is the American football player Charlie Peprah. His other grandson is 6&#x27;9&quot; Fulham F.C. striker Yakini Acheampong. 

Whilst he was brought up a Catholic, during his rule he addressed both a gathering of &#x27;Spiritual Churches&#x27; in July 1972 and a pagan ceremony, the &#x27;cow slaughtering ceremony&#x27; at Shana for the Pra River god on 1 December 1973. At both events, his comments expressed belief in the religions.

<text>Gainsthorpe is a deserted medieval village (DMV) site in a field which is part of the present Gainsthorpe Farm in Lincolnshire, England. The site is in Hibaldstow civil parish located on a minor road west of the A15 road, south of Hibaldstow and south-west of Brigg.

It is now in the care of English Heritage. There is a small car park from where a footpath of about leads to the site. The typical medieval layout of sunken roads and raised rectangular tofts and crofts is clearly seen in the humps and hollows of the field.

<text>Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, (; nom de guerre: Jan Bugaj; 22 January 1921 – 4 August 1944) was a Polish poet and Home Army soldier, one of the most well known of the Generation of Columbuses, the young generation of Polish poets, of whom several perished in the Warsaw Uprising and during the German occupation of Poland.
==Biography==

Baczyński was born in Warsaw into the family of renowned literary critic and soldier of the Polish Legions in World War I, Stanisław Baczyński and school teacher Stefania Zieleńczyk (). His mother was a zealous Catholic but with Jewish roots, and as such was treated by the Germans as Jewish. His uncle, Dr. Adam Zieleńczyk, escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto and was killed by Germans in 1943.

Baczynski was baptized on 7 September 1922 in Warsaw. As a child, he suffered from asthma, his heart was very weak and he was in constant threat of tuberculosis. In 1933, he began education at Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Stefana Batorego, he graduated in May 1939. In his class there were future heroes of the Szare Szeregi - Jan Bytnar (&quot;Rudy&quot;) and Tadeusz Zawadzki (&quot;Zośka&quot;). Baczynski debuted as a poet some time in 1938 in &quot;Strzała&quot; - a magazine published by the Organization of Socialist Youth &quot;Spartakus&quot;, to which he belonged himself. After graduation, he wished to continue his education at Warsaw&#x27;s Academy of Fine Arts, but the outbreak of World War II ended these plans.

During the German and Soviet (until 1941) occupation of Poland, he continued to work with the left-wing underground press, most notably with the &quot;Płomienie&quot; (&quot;Flames&quot;) and &quot;Droga&quot; (&quot;Way&quot;) magazines. At the same time he was a student of Polish language at the secret underground Warsaw University and the Armia Krajowa&#x27;s &quot;Agricola&quot; NCOs School. He took up several jobs, and in 1943 joined Batalion Zośka, after which he gave up studies, committing himself to the Polish resistance activities. In his apartment, he hid several pieces of weaponry, including submachine guns and grenades.

On 3rd June 1942, he married Barbara Drapczyńska, a university colleague. The marriage resulted in a set of erotica written by Baczyński, reputedly one of the most notable in the Polish language. In 1942, he gave his wife a hand-made volume of poetry &quot;In Purest Sorrow&quot; as a wedding gift. Shortly before the Warsaw Uprising Baczyński gave a copy of all his poems to one of his friends, to hide in Żoliborz. Because of that, they survived the war.

As a member of Scouting Assault Groups (&quot;Harcerskie Grupy Szturmowe&quot;), Baczyński took part in many sabotage actions throughout the occupation. One of them was derailment of a German military train in August 1944, which resulted in a 26-hour delay of traffic on the strategic connection Warsaw-Białystok.

After the Warsaw Uprising broke out, he joined the &quot;Parasol&quot; battalion. He was killed in action by a German sniper at approximately 4pm on 4 August 1944 in the Blanka Palace in the Warsaw Old Town. He is buried in the Powązki Military Cemetery, together with his pregnant wife, who was killed on 1 September 1944. He was posthumously awarded the Armia Krajowa Cross and in 1947 the Medal for Warsaw 1939-1945 (pl).

In his poems and short novels, Baczyński demonstrated both romantic traditions and catastrophism. His poems depict the brutality of war, and suggest that love is the only force that can effectively defend a human being against it. His talent was highly appreciated by his contemporaries, Stanisław Pigon, upon hearing news of Baczynski joining the Szare Szeregi, said to Kazimierz Wyka: &quot;We belong to a nation, whose fate is to shoot at the enemy with diamonds&quot;.

<text>Kulfi () is a frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as &quot;traditional Indian ice cream&quot;. Kulfi originated in 16th-century Delhi during the Mughal era. It is part of the national cuisines of India and Pakistan. It is also popular in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East.

Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream. It comes in various flavours. Traditional ones include cream (&quot;malai&quot;), rose, mango, cardamom (&quot;elaichi&quot;), saffron (&quot;kesar&quot; or &quot;zafran&quot;), and pistachio. Newer flavours may include apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, or avocado. Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not churned while it is frozen, resulting in a denser final product which is considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert. The density of kulfi causes it to melt more slowly than ice cream.

==History==

The word &quot;kulfi&quot; comes from the Persian (قلفی) meaning &quot;covered cup&quot;. The dessert originated in Delhi during the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. The mixture of dense evaporated milk was already popular in the sweet dishes in the Indian subcontinent. During the Mughal period, this mixture was flavoured with pistachios and saffron, packed into metal cones and immersed in slurry ice, resulting in the invention of kulfi. &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, a detailed record of the Mughal emperor Akbar&#x27;s administration, mentions use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of Himalayan ice to warmer areas.

Although Delhi has been described as the birthplace of kulfi, Australian food historian Charmaine O&#x27;Brien suggests, &quot;...it is likely that [kulfi] originally evolved in the cooler climates of Persia or Samarkand and that the Mughals appropriated the concept and elaborated on it to create the creamy, perfumed dessert that it now is.&quot;

==Preparation==
To prepare kulfi, sweetened, flavoured milk is slow cooked. The milk is stirred almost continuously to prevent it from sticking to the cooking utensil. During this process, the milk condenses and thickens. The slow cooking caramelises the sugar in the mixture and browns its milk proteins, giving kulfi its distinctive taste. The mixture is then poured into moulds (often &quot;kulhars&quot;) and sealed. The sealed moulds are submerged in an insulated &quot;matka&quot; filled with ice and salt. This quickly freezes the mixture, giving it a soft, smooth consistency free of ice crystals. Kulfi prepared in this traditional way is called &quot;matka kulfi&quot;.

The moulds are removed from the freezer 10–15 minutes before serving to allow the kulfi to melt slightly. The kulfi is then removed from the moulds and garnished with ground cardamom, saffron, or pistachios. Kulfi is also served with &quot;falooda&quot; (vermicelli noodles).

==Retail sales==
Throughout the Indian subcontinent, kulfi is sold by street vendors known as &quot;kulfiwallahs&quot;. It is also commonly served in Indian restaurants.

<text>The Vatican Observatory () is an astronomical research and educational institution supported by the Holy See. Originally based in the Roman College of Rome, the Observatory is now headquartered in Castel Gandolfo, Italy and operates a telescope at the Mount Graham International Observatory in the United States.

The Director of the Observatory is Brother Guy Consolmagno, an American Jesuit. In 2008, the Templeton Prize was awarded to cosmologist Fr. Michał Heller, a Vatican Observatory Adjunct Scholar. In 2010, the George Van Biesbroeck Prize was awarded to former observatory director, the American Jesuit, Fr. George Coyne.

==History==

The Church has had a long-standing interest in astronomy, due to the astronomical basis of the calendar by which holy days and Easter are determined. For instance, the Gregorian Calendar, promulgated in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII, was developed by Aloysius Lilius and later modified by Christoph Clavius at the Collegio Romano from astronomical data. The Gregorian Tower was completed in 1580 for his purpose, designed by Bolognese architect Ottaviano Nonni.

In the 18th century, the Papacy actively supported astronomy, establishing the Observatory of the Roman College in 1774. In 1787–1789, the &quot;Specola Vaticana&quot; in the Tower of the Winds within the Vatican was established under the direction of Msgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii (1756–1821). When Msgr. Gilii died, the &quot;Specola&quot; was closed down because it was inconvenient for students in the city because the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s obstructed its view. Its instruments were transferred to the College Observatory. A third facility, the Observatory of the Capitol, was operated from 1827 to 1870.

Father Angelo Secchi SJ relocated the College Observatory to the top of Sant&#x27;Ignazio di Loyola a Campo Marzio (Church of St. Ignatius in Rome). In 1870, with the capture of Rome, the College Observatory fell into the hands of the Italian Government. Out of respect for his work, however, Father Secchi was permitted to continue using the Observatory. After Secchi&#x27;s death in 1878 the Observatory was nationalized by the Italian government and renamed the &quot;Regio Osservatorio al Collegio Romano&quot; (&quot;Royal Observatory at the Roman College&quot;), ending astronomical research in the Vatican.

In 1891, however, Pope Leo XIII issued a &quot;Motu proprio&quot; re-founding the &quot;Specola Vaticana&quot; (Vatican Observatory) and a new observatory was built on the walls at the edge of the Vatican. The new Vatican Observatory remained there for the next forty years.

In the late nineteenth-century the Vatican Observatory was part of a group of top astronomy institutions from around the world which worked together to create a photographic &quot;Celestial Map&quot; (&quot;Carte du Ciel&quot;) and an &quot;astrographic&quot; catalog pinpointing the stars&#x27; positions. Italian astronomer Father Francesco Denza led the Vatican&#x27;s contribution to the project until his death in 1894. In the early twentieth-century Father John Hagen took over the project and recruited a group of nuns from the Sisters of the Holy Child Mary to work on the necessary recording and calculations. The sisters were Sisters Emilia Ponzoni, Regina Colombo, Concetta Finardi and Luigia Panceri.


By the 1930s, the smoke and sky-glow of the city had made it impossible to conduct useful observations in Rome. Pope Pius XI relocated the Observatory to Castel Gandolfo, which is southeast of Rome. By 1961, the same problems with light pollution made observing difficult at Castel Gandolfo. The Observatory then established the Vatican Observatory Research Group (VORG), with offices at the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.

D.K.J. O&#x27;Connell produced the first color photographs of a green flash at sunset in 1960. In 1993, VORG completed construction of the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, which is at Mount Graham near Safford, Arizona.

The Observatory&#x27;s headquarters remain in Italy at Castel Gandolfo. In early 2008, the Vatican announced that the Observatory would be relocated to a former convent a mile away from the castle as part of a general reconstruction of the Papal residence. Its former space would be used to provide more room for the reception of diplomatic visitors. The old quarters in the castle were cramped and very poorly laid out for the Observatory&#x27;s use. VORG research activities in Arizona continued unaffected.

<text>St. George&#x27;s (formally the Town of St. George or St. George&#x27;s Town), located on the island and within the parish of the same names (and on the northern side of St. George&#x27;s Harbour), settled in 1612, is the first permanent English (and later British) settlement on the islands of Bermuda. It is often described as the third permanent British settlement in the Americas, after Jamestown, Virginia (1607), and Cupids, Newfoundland (1610), and the oldest continuously-inhabited British town in the New World, since the other two settlements were seasonal for a number of years.

== Nomenclature ==
Bermudian convention, where a toponym contains the name of a person, is to render the person&#x27;s name in the possessive form. The place is rarely treated as equivalent to the person.
Among many examples of such place names in Bermuda are St. David&#x27;s Island, Bailey&#x27;s Bay, Smith&#x27;s Parish (named for aristocrat Sir Thomas Smith), Sandys&#x27; Parish (named for Sir Edwin Sandys), Skeeters&#x27; Island (often mistakenly rendered &quot;Skeeter&#x27;s Island&quot;, it is named for &quot;Edward Skeeters&quot; and is also known as &quot;Burt&#x27;s Island&quot;), &quot;Gibb&#x27;s Hill&quot;, &quot;Barr&#x27;s Bay&quot;, &quot;Ackermann&#x27;s Hill&quot;, &quot;Nelly&#x27;s Island&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s Island, Darrell&#x27;s Island, &quot;Paynter&#x27;s Vale&quot;, &quot;Abbot&#x27;s Head&quot; (or &quot;Abbot&#x27;s Cliff&quot;), and Fort St. Catherine&#x27;s (on St. Catherine&#x27;s Point). The possessive form is also used for titles, as with &quot;Collector&#x27;s Hill&quot; (named for the &quot;Collector of Taxes&quot;). Maps of Bermuda have most often been produced by non-Bermudians and names given on them do not always conform to Bermudian practice.

The use of the possessive form is not exclusive, however, as exemplified by place names such as the names of most of the parishes (which – other than St. George&#x27;s Parish – all commemorate historical people), such as Hamilton Parish (named for James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton), Devonshire Parish (named for William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire), and Paget Parish. Some of these exceptions may have originated with changed syntax, as &quot;Devonshire Parish&quot; may originally have been &quot;The Parish of Devonshire&quot;. This is seen with the &quot;City of Hamilton&quot; (named for Henry Hamilton, a former Governor of Bermuda). Whereas the City of Hamilton is commonly referred to as &quot;Hamilton&quot;, The Town of St. George, St. George&#x27;s Parish, St. George&#x27;s Island, and St. George&#x27;s Harbour (and any other toponym usually containing a person&#x27;s name in the possessive form) always remains possessive when shortened, such as in the &quot;St. George&#x27;s Foundation&quot;.

== History ==


Originally called &quot;New London&quot;, St. George&#x27;s was first settled in 1612. This was three years after the first English settlers landed on St. George&#x27;s Island on their way to Virginia. Led by Admiral Sir George Somers and Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, they had deliberately steered their ship, &quot;Sea Venture,&quot; onto a reef to escape a storm. The survivors built two new ships, the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;, and most continued their voyage to Jamestown, but the Virginia Company laid claim to the island.

Two men remained behind to maintain the company&#x27;s possession of the archipelago (a third stayed when the &quot;Patience&quot; returned later that year). By the Virginia Company&#x27;s Third Charter in 1612, the boundaries of the new colony were extended out to sea to include Bermuda. The company sent a party of 60 new settlers to Bermuda to join the three men left behind by the &quot;Sea Venture.&quot; After a brief period on neighbouring St. David&#x27;s, the settlers started building structures at St. George&#x27;s, located in a sheltered sound that kept ships protected from bad weather.

In 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a second company, the Somers Isles Company. It administered Bermuda separately until the company was dissolved in 1686. (The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1624).

This small town was the capital of Bermuda until 1815; it was linked to the history of colonial America. Ten thousand Bermudians emigrated, primarily to Virginia and the American Southeast, before United States independence made them citizens of separate nations. Branches of wealthy Bermudian merchant families dominated trade in the area&#x27;s ports. Bermudians settled towns in the South, and contributed greatly to the make up of the populations of several US states.

As Bermuda&#x27;s population centre, and only true port during this period, St. George&#x27;s was connected to development in the North American colonies. During the American War of Independence, at the request of George Washington, Bermudians assisted the American rebels in stealing much-needed gunpowder from a St. George&#x27;s magazine, which supplied the forts protecting the port. The powder was carried over the hill to Tobacco Bay, from where boats transported it to an American ship that lay offshore.

During the American Civil War, some British from St. George&#x27;s evaded coastal blockades to provide supplies and munitions to the desperate Confederates. This trade was based in St. George&#x27;s.

King&#x27;s Square forms the centre of St George&#x27;s, where regular 17th-century re-enactments are held throughout the year. Excavations carried out by Bristol University and the Bermuda National Trust discovered the foundations here of the original 1612 governor&#x27;s house. The Bermuda National Trust Museum is located on the square.

Ordnance Island in St. George&#x27;s Harbour, is situated south of King&#x27;s Square. It holds a replica of &quot;Deliverance&quot; (one of the two ships built by the survivors of &quot;Sea Venture&quot;), and a life-sized statue of Admiral of the Virginia Company, Sir George Somers, by Desmond Fountain. Somers, along with Sir Thomas Gates, had led the survivors of the 1609 wreck.

The town has numerous historical sites, such as the old State House from 1620. Other than fortifications, this was the first stone building in Bermuda, built to house the Parliament. It is the oldest building on the island. Others of note are the Unfinished Church, the Old Rectory, St. Peter&#x27;s (the oldest surviving Anglican and oldest continuously occupied Protestant church in the Western hemisphere), the Tucker House, the Bermuda National Trust Museum, and the St. George&#x27;s Historical Society Museum and the Featherbed Alley Printshop museum (both in the Mitchell House).

In 1996, the town was twinned with Lyme Regis, in Dorset, England, the birthplace of Admiral Sir George Somers. In 2000, the town, together with numerous surrounding fortifications, including the Castle Islands Fortifications, was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, formally known as the Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications.

*Meanings derived from the term &quot;stall&quot;, see Stall (disambiguation)

**Stalling (behavior)**

*Stalling* refers to the act of intentionally delaying or postponing an action, task, or decision, often to avoid or defer the associated responsibility or effort. This behavior can manifest in various contexts, including work, relationships, and personal commitments. Stalling may involve making excuses, offering vague responses, or simply avoiding action altogether.

Example:
Rilley is stalling icons for months because he doesn’t want to do it or say no, continuously delaying the task without providing a clear explanation or refusal.

<doc id="872888" wikidata="Q15059422" url="?curid=872888" title="Kōkako">
<text>Kōkako are two species of forest bird in the genus Callaeas which are endemic to New Zealand, the endangered North Island kōkako (&quot;Callaeas wilsoni&quot;) and the presumed extinct South Island kōkako (&quot;Callaeas cinereus&quot;). They are both slate-grey with wattles and have black masks. They belong to a family containing five species of New Zealand wattlebirds, the other three being two species of tīeke (saddleback) and the extinct huia. Previously widespread, kōkako populations throughout New Zealand have been decimated by the predations of mammalian invasive species such as possums, stoats, cats and rats, and their range has contracted significantly. In the past this bird was called the New Zealand crow. It is not closely related to the crow, but looks like one from a distance.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Callaeas&quot; was introduced in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster to accommodate a single species, the South Island kōkako, which is therefore the type species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;kallaia&quot; for a cock&#x27;s wattles.

The kōkako appears to be a remnant of an early expansion of passerines in New Zealand and is one of five species of New Zealand wattlebirds of the family Callaeidae, the others being two species of endangered tieke, or saddleback, and the extinct huia. New Zealand wattlebirds have no close relatives apart from the stitchbird, and their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined.

== Description ==

The North Island kōkako, &quot;Callaeas wilsoni&quot; has blue wattles (although this colour develops with age: in the young of this bird they are actually coloured a light pink). The South Island kōkako, &quot;Callaeas cinereus&quot;, by contrast has largely orange wattles, with only a small patch of blue at the base.

==Behaviour==

The kōkako has a beautiful, clear, organ-like song. Its call can carry for kilometres. Breeding pairs sing together in a bell-like duet for up to an hour in the early morning. Different populations in different parts of the North Island (if any populations of the South Island kōkako remain they are at present unknown) have distinctly different songs.

The kōkako is a poor flier and seldom flies more than 100 metres. The wings of this species are relatively short and rounded. It prefers to hop and leap from branch to branch on its powerful grey legs. It does not fly so much as glide and when seen exhibiting this behaviour they will generally scramble up tall trees (frequently New Zealand podocarps such as rimu and matai) before gliding to others nearby. Its ecological niche has been compared to that of a flying squirrel. Its diet consists of leaves, fern fronds, flowers, fruit and invertebrates.

== Kōkako and humans ==
Māori myth refers to the kōkako in several stories. In one notable story, a kōkako gave Māui water as he fought the sun by filling its plump wattles with water and offering it to Māui to quench his thirst. Māui rewarded kōkako for its kindness by stretching its legs until they were lean, long and strong, so that kōkako could easily leap through the forest to find food.

The kōkako appears on the reverse side of the New Zealand $50 note.

<text>HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; was a dreadnought battleship built in the United Kingdom in the early 1910s. Originally part of Brazil&#x27;s role in a South American naval arms race, she holds the distinction of mounting more heavy guns (fourteen) and more turrets (seven) than any other dreadnought battleship, in keeping with the Brazilians&#x27; requirement for an especially impressive design.

Brazil ordered the ship in 1911 as &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot; from the British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the collapse of Brazil&#x27;s rubber boom and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country&#x27;s chief rival, led to the ship&#x27;s sale while under construction to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans renamed her &quot;Sultan Osman I&quot;, after the empire&#x27;s founder, and the ship was nearly complete when the First World War broke out. The British government seized her for use by the Royal Navy, together with another Ottoman dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete.

Renamed &quot;Agincourt&quot; by the Royal Navy, she joined the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. During the war, the ship spent the bulk of her time on patrols and exercises, although she did participate in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. &quot;Agincourt&quot; was put into reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Background==


In the unstable period during and following the 1889 coup in Brazil, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and the 1893–94 navy revolt, the Brazilian Navy found itself unable to care for its own ships, let alone acquire new vessels. Meanwhile, Chile had agreed to a naval-limiting pact in 1902 with Brazil&#x27;s principal rival, Argentina, as part of solving a larger boundary dispute, but they both retained the vessels built in the interim, many of which were significantly more modern and powerful than Brazil&#x27;s ships. The Brazilian Navy was left behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quantity as well—by the turn of the 20th century, Chile&#x27;s total naval tonnage was , Argentina&#x27;s , and Brazil&#x27;s —even though Brazil had nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times that of Chile.

Rising international demand for coffee and rubber in the early 20th century brought Brazil an influx of revenue. Simultaneously, the Baron of Rio Branco spearheaded a drive by prominent Brazilians to force the leading world nations to recognize Brazil as an international power. The National Congress of Brazil inaugurated a large naval acquisition program in late 1904. They ordered three small battleships in 1906, but the launch of caused the Brazilian Navy to reconsider their purchase. In March 1907, they signed a contract for three s. Two ships would be constructed immediately by the British companies Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers, with the third to follow.

Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact and sought dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina&#x27;s orders, after a drawn-out bidding process, went to an American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile&#x27;s orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil&#x27;s relations with Argentina were warming and the country&#x27;s economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;″s keel in March 1910.

The Brazilian Navy had divided into two distinct factions, based on the size of the main battery. The outgoing naval minister favoured an increase over the 12-inch guns mounted on board the &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; class, while his incoming counterpart, Admiral Marques Leão, favoured keeping the smaller but faster-firing gun. While the exact influences upon the Brazilian government are unclear, Leão was advocating strongly for his position in meetings with President Hermes da Fonseca. Other events probably influenced them as well, such as the November 1910 Revolt of the Lash, payments on loans taken out for the dreadnoughts, and a worsening economy that had led to high government debt compounded by budget deficits. By May 1911, Fonseca had made up his mind:

When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, a vessel of 32,000 tons, with an armament of 14 in. guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.

A contract to build the ship that would become &quot;Agincourt&quot; was signed on 3 June 1911, and its keel was laid on 14 September 1911. The design called for fourteen 12-inch guns, an extreme number that historian David Topliss attributed to political necessity: the ship had to appear more powerful to the Brazilian populace than her predecessors (with twelve 12-inch guns) but, without increasing the gun size, the only option left was increasing the total number of guns.

==Design and description==
===General characteristics===
&quot;Agincourt&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load. She had a large turning circle, but manoeuvred well despite her great length. She was considered to be a good gun platform.

When she came to serve in the Royal Navy, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was considered a particularly comfortable ship and very well-appointed internally. A knowledge of Portuguese was necessary to work many of the fittings—including those in the heads—as the original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by the British. In 1917, her crew numbered 1,268 officers and men.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Agincourt&quot; had four Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft. The high-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the wing shafts while the low-pressure ahead and astern turbines drove the inner shafts. The three-bladed propellers were in diameter. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but achieved more than during her sea trials, slightly exceeding her designed speed of .

The steam plant consisted of twenty-two Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers with an operating pressure of . &quot;Agincourt&quot; normally carried of coal, but could carry a maximum of , as well as of fuel oil to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . Electrical power was provided by four steam-driven reciprocating electrical generators.

===Armament===

&quot;Agincourt&quot; mounted fourteen BL 12-inch Mk XIII 45-calibre guns in seven twin hydraulically powered turrets, unofficially named after the days of the week, starting from Sunday, forward to aft. This was the largest number of turrets and heavy guns ever mounted on a dreadnought battleship. The guns could be depressed to −3° and elevated to 13.5°. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 13.5°, this provided a maximum range of just over with armour-piercing (AP) shells. During the war the turrets were modified to increase their maximum elevation to 16°, but this only extended the range to . The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5 rounds per minute. When a full broadside was fired, &quot;the resulting sheet of flame was big enough to create the impression that a battle cruiser had blown up; it was awe inspiring.&quot; No damage was done to the ship when firing full broadsides, despite the common idea that doing so would break the ship in half, but much of the ship&#x27;s tableware and glassware did shatter when &quot;Agincourt&quot; fired her first broadside.

As built, &quot;Agincourt&quot; mounted eighteen BL 6-inch Mk XIII 50-calibre guns. Fourteen were placed in armoured casemates on the upper deck and two each in the fore and aft superstructures, protected by gun shields. After the ship was seized by the British, two more were added abreast the bridge in pivot mounts, protected by gun shields. The guns could be depressed to −7° and elevated to 13°, later increased to 15°. They had a range of at 15° when firing a shell with a muzzle velocity of . Their rate of fire was about five to seven rounds per minute, but this dropped to about three rounds per minute after the ready ammunition was used up because the ammunition hoists were too slow or few to keep the guns fully supplied. About 150 rounds were carried per gun.

Close-range defence against torpedo boats was provided by ten 45-calibre quick-firing guns. These were mounted in the superstructure in pivot mounts and protected by gun shields. &quot;Agincourt&quot; also carried three  submerged torpedo tubes; one was on each beam and the last was in the stern. The water that entered the torpedo tubes when they were fired was discharged into the torpedo flat to facilitate reloading the tube and then pumped overboard. This meant that the torpedo crewmen would be operating in of water if rapid fire was required. Ten torpedoes were carried for them.

===Fire control===
Each turret was fitted with an armoured rangefinder in the turret roof. In addition, another one was mounted on top of the foretop. By the time of the Battle of Jutland in 1916, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was possibly the only dreadnought of the Grand Fleet not fitted with a Dreyer fire-control table. A fire-control director was later fitted below the foretop and one turret was modified to control the entire main armament later in the war. A director for the guns was added on each side in 1916–17. A high-angle rangefinder was added in 1918 to the spotting top.

===Armour===
So much weight had been devoted to &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s armament that little remained for her armour. Her waterline belt was just thick, compared with twelve inches or more found in other British dreadnoughts. It ran some , from the forward edge of &quot;Monday&quot; barbette to the middle of &quot;Friday&quot; barbette. Forward of this the belt thinned to six inches for about before further reducing to all the way to the bow. Aft of the midships section the belt reduced to six inches for about and then thinned to four inches (102 mm); it did not reach the stern, but terminated at the rear bulkhead. The upper belt extended from the main to the upper deck and was six inches thick. It ran from &quot;Monday&quot; barbette to &quot;Thursday&quot; barbette. The armour bulkheads at each end of the ship angled inwards from the ends of the midships armoured belts to the end barbettes and were three inches thick. Four of &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from .

The armour of the barbettes constituted a major weakness in &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s protection. They were 9 inches thick above the upper deck level, but decreased to 3 inches between the upper and main decks and had no armour at all below the main deck except for &quot;Sunday&quot; barbette (which had 3 inches), and &quot;Thursday&quot; and &quot;Saturday&quot; barbettes (which had 2 inches). The turret armour was 12 inches thick on the face, on the side and in the rear. The turret roofs were 3 inches thick at the front and 2 inches at the rear. The casemates for the secondary armament were protected by 6 inches of armour and were defended from raking fire by 6-inch-thick bulkheads.

The main conning tower was protected by 12 inches of armour on its sides and it had a 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 inches thick above the upper deck and 2 inches thick below it. Each magazine was protected by two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half inches thick.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; had another weakness in that she was not subdivided to Royal Navy standards as the Brazilians preferred to eliminate all possible watertight bulkheads that might limit the size of the compartments and interfere with the crew&#x27;s comfort. One example was the officer&#x27;s wardroom, which was in size, much larger than anything else in the Grand Fleet.

===Wartime modifications===
Approximately of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck after the Battle of Jutland to protect the magazines. Two anti-aircraft guns were added to the quarterdeck in 1917–18. A rangefinder was added to the former searchlight platform on the foremast at the same time. A high-angle rangefinder was added to the spotting top in 1918.

==Construction and seizure==

&quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot;, as &quot;Agincourt&quot; was named by her first owners, was laid down on 14 September 1911 by Armstrong Whitworth at their Elswick Yard in Newcastle upon Tyne and launched on 22 January 1913. After the keel-laying, the Brazilian government found itself in an unenviable position: a European depression after the end of the Second Balkan War in August 1913 reduced Brazil&#x27;s ability to obtain foreign loans, while at the same time Brazil&#x27;s coffee and rubber exports collapsed, the latter due to the loss of the Brazilian rubber monopoly to British plantations in the Far East. In addition, reports on new dreadnought construction coming in from overseas indicated that the vessel would be outclassed upon completion. These factors caused Brazil to put the ship up for sale in October 1913, and she was sold to the Ottoman Navy for £2,750,000 on 28 December 1913. Renamed &quot;Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel&quot;, she underwent trials during the July Crisis the following year and was completed in August, just as the First World War was beginning.

The war broke out during her sea trials before delivery. Even though the Ottoman crew had arrived to collect her, the British Government took over the vessel for incorporation into the Royal Navy. The Turkish captain, waiting with five hundred Turkish sailors aboard a transport in the River Tyne, threatened to board his ship and hoist the Turkish flag; First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill gave orders to resist such an attempt &quot;by armed force if necessary.&quot; At the same time, the British also took over a second Ottoman battleship, a -derived vessel being built by Vickers—&quot;Reşadiye&quot;—which was renamed . Such an action was allowed in the contract only if Britain was at war at the time, but since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government were nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. On 3 August, a day before Germany invaded Belgium, causing British political elites to reach a consensus on entering the war, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships. Churchill did not want to risk the ships being used against the British, but it had consequences.

The takeover caused considerable ill will in the Ottoman Empire, where public subscriptions had partially funded the ships. When the Ottoman government had been in a financial deadlock over the budget of the battleships, donations for the Ottoman Navy had come in from taverns, cafés, schools and markets, and large donations were rewarded with a &quot;Navy Donation Medal&quot;. As a result, the seizure, and the gifts of the German battlecruiser and the cruiser to the Ottomans, influenced public opinion in the Empire to turn away from Britain. Although there is no evidence that the seizure played any part in the Ottoman government&#x27;s October 1914 decision to declare war on Britain and the Triple Entente, the Ottomans did curiously offer to transfer &quot;Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel&quot; to the Germans at the beginning of August 1914. Historian David Fromkin has speculated that this offer was made in exchange for signing a secret defensive alliance, and that the Ottomans extended it only after learning that their battleship had been seized by the British.

The Royal Navy made modifications to &quot;Agincourt&quot; before commissioning her: in particular, it removed the flying bridge over the two centre turrets. The ship was also initially fitted with Turkish-style lavatories that had to be replaced. Her name, &quot;Agincourt&quot;, was a favourite of Churchill&#x27;s, and had initially been allocated to a sixth vessel of the ordered under the 1914–15 Naval Estimates, but not yet begun at the war&#x27;s outbreak. Her nickname, &quot;The Gin Palace&quot;, came from her luxurious fittings and a corruption of her name (&quot;A Gin Court&quot;), pink gin being a popular drink among Royal Navy officers at the time.

The Admiralty was unprepared to man a ship of &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s size on such short notice and her crew was drawn &quot;from the highest and lowest echelons of the service: the Royal yachts, and the detention barracks.&quot; &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s captain and executive officer came from , most of whose crew was also transferred to &quot;Agincourt&quot; on 3 August 1914. Most of the naval reservists had already been called up by this time and sent to other ships, so a number of minor criminals who had had their sentences remitted were received from various naval prisons and detention camps.

==Service==
&quot;Agincourt&quot; was working up until 7 September 1914, when she joined the 4th Battle Squadron (BS) of the Grand Fleet. The fleet anchorage at Scapa Flow was not yet secure against submarine attack and much of the fleet was kept at sea, where &quot;Agincourt&quot; spent forty of her first eighty days with the Grand Fleet. This was the beginning of &quot;a year and a half of inaction, only broken by occasional North Sea &#x27;sweeps&#x27; intended to draw the enemy from his bases.&quot;
On 1 January 1915, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was still assigned to the 4th BS, but had been assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron before the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. She was the last ship of the Sixth Division of the 1st BS, along with , and the flagship, , the most heterogeneous group possible as each ship was from a different class. The Sixth Division was the starboardmost column of the Grand Fleet as it headed south to rendezvous with the ships of Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battle Cruiser Fleet, then engaged with their opposite numbers from the German High Seas Fleet in the North Sea. Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, kept it in cruising formation until 18:15, when he ordered it to deploy from column into a single line based on the port division, each ship turning 90° in succession. This turn made the Sixth Division the closest ships in the Grand Fleet to the battleships of the High Seas Fleet, and they fired on each ship as they made their turn to port. This concentration of fire later became known as &quot;Windy Corner&quot; to the British, as the ships were drenched by German shell splashes although none were hit.
At 18:24, &quot;Agincourt&quot; opened fire on a German battlecruiser with her main guns. Shortly afterwards her six-inch guns followed suit as German destroyers made torpedo attacks on the British battleships to cover the turn to the south of the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Agincourt&quot; successfully evaded two torpedoes, although another struck &quot;Marlborough&quot;. Visibility cleared around 19:15, and she engaged a without result before it was lost in the smoke and haze. Around 20:00, &quot;Marlborough&quot; was forced to reduce speed because of the strain on her bulkheads from her torpedo damage and her division mates conformed to her speed. In the reduced visibility the division lost sight of the Grand Fleet during the night, passing the badly damaged battlecruiser without opening fire. Dawn found them with only the detritus from the previous day&#x27;s battle in sight and the division arrived back at Scapa Flow on 2 June. &quot;Agincourt&quot; fired 144 twelve-inch shells and 111 six-inch shells during the battle, although she is not known to have hit anything.
Although the Grand Fleet made several sorties over the next few years it is not known if &quot;Agincourt&quot; participated in them. On 23 April 1918, &quot;Agincourt&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot; were stationed at Scapa Flow to provide cover for the Scandinavian convoys between Norway and Britain when the High Seas Fleet sortied in an attempt to destroy the convoy. The reports from German Intelligence were slightly off schedule, as both the inbound and outbound convoys were in port when the Germans reached their normal route, so Admiral Scheer ordered the fleet to return to Germany without spotting any British ships.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; was later transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron and was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918. She was placed in reserve at Rosyth in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. The Royal Navy then planned to convert her into a mobile naval base and she was recommissioned on 21 November in preparation for the conversion, which would have included the removal of five of her seven turrets with their barbettes converted into storage and workshops; Nos. 2 and 5 turrets would have been retained. The conversion was cancelled on 23 February 1922 after the Washington Naval Treaty was signed that limited the battleship tonnage allowed to the RN and she was paid off on 7 April and listed again for disposal.

The ship was sold on 22 January 1923 to J&amp;W Purves for £25,000 with the proviso that she had to be demolished 18 months after the treaty had been ratified. Her contract was immediately transferred to the Rosyth Shipbreaking Co. which had leased facilities at Rosyth Dockyard for that purpose. As the deadline of 17 January 1925 approached, the ship did not yet meet the treaty standards for scrapping. The Admiralty agreed that cutting the hull in half would be acceptable and the company attempted to move the ship through the dockyard locks on the highest Spring Tide to its beaching ground to complete the demolition. Bad weather thwarted that effort and the Admiralty agreed to allow the use of one of Rosyth&#x27;s dry docks to meet the deadline. Two days later the hull had been severed and both halves had been floated out so they could be beached.

He was born in Kinshasa, Zaire but emigrated to France with his parents at the age of seven. Kaysha&#x27;s first single, which used a sample from French West Indian band Kassav&#x27;s &quot;Oulé&quot;, was called &quot;Bounce Baby&quot;.

Kaysha&#x27;s second single was &quot;Telephone&quot;, from his album &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;. The next year, he changed his entire style to record a more urban album called &quot;Worldwidechico&quot; with a duo with Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Killah Priest. One of his biggest single is the global African hit &quot;On dit quoi&quot;, from his album &quot;It&#x27;s All Love&quot;, released on his own label Sushiraw in 2003. Some of his biggest hits are &quot;Love de toi&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, &quot;Question my heart&quot;, &quot;Fiona&quot;, &quot;Musiquarian&quot; and many more...

Kaysha is also a music producer. He produced songs for Passi, Solaar, Jacob Desvarieux, Soumia, Elizio, Ludo, Vanda May, Aycee Jordanu and others.

He produced huge hits for other artists like &quot;Deeper&quot; &amp; &quot;Rebound Chick&quot; for Nelson Freitas, &quot;I like it&quot; for Abege, &quot;Close your eyes&quot; for Djodje, &quot;Ceu&quot; &amp; &quot;Love again&quot; for C4 Pedro, and many more hits

Kaysha is one of the first African artist to have been nominated in the MTV Europe Awards in 2005 for Best African Artist

He won a Kora award for best African Artist in 2000. He won a Kora award for best African Artist of the Diaspora in 2004 and 2005.

In 2015, he issued an Afro-house hit single, &quot;Mama Kosa&quot; featuring Central African, DJ and music producer, Boddhi Satva.

<text>Devil Girl from Mars is a 1954 British second feature black-and-white science fiction film, produced by the Danziger Brothers, directed by David MacDonald and starring Patricia Laffan, Hugh McDermott, Hazel Court, Peter Reynolds, and Adrienne Corri. It was released by British Lion, and released in the United States the following year. A female alien is sent from Mars to acquire human males to replace their declining male population. When negotiation, then intimidation, fails she must use force to obtain co-operation from a remote Scottish village where she has landed her crippled flying saucer.

==Plot==
Nyah, a female commander from Mars, heads for London in her flying saucer. She is part of the advance alien team looking for Earthmen to replace the declining male population on her world, the result of a &quot;devastating war between the sexes&quot;. Because of damage to her craft, caused when entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and an apparent crash with an airliner, she is forced to land in the remote Scottish moors. She is armed with a raygun that can paralyse or kill, and is accompanied by a tall, menacing robot named Chani.

Professor Arnold Hennessey, an astrophysicist, accompanied by journalist Michael Carter, is sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the crash, believed to be caused by a meteorite. The pair come to the Bonnie Charlie, a remote inn run by Mr and Mrs Jamieson in the depths of the Scottish Highlands.

At the bar they meet Ellen Prestwick, a fashion model who came to the Bonnie Charlie to escape an affair with a married man. She quickly forms a romantic liaison with Carter. Meanwhile, escaped convict Robert Justin (under the alias Albert Simpson), convicted for accidentally killing his wife, comes to the inn to reunite with barmaid Doris, with whom he is in love.

Nyah happens across the inn, incinerates the Jamiesons&#x27; handyman David, and enters the bar. When she finds no one willing to come with her to Mars, she responds with intimidation, trapping the guests and staff within an invisible wall and turning Chani loose to vaporise much of the manor’s grounds. Discovering Justin and Tommy, the Jamiesons&#x27; young nephew, hiding in the grounds, Nyah kidnaps Tommy as a possible male specimen, and sends Justin back to the inn under some manner of mind control. Nyah then brings Professor Hennessy aboard her spaceship to view the technological achievements of Martian civilisation, including the ship&#x27;s atomic power source. In exchange for Tommy, Carter volunteers to go to Mars with Nyah.

Realising that the only road to victory over Nyah requires trickery, Hennessy suggests Carter sabotage the ship&#x27;s power source after take off. However, Carter attempts a double cross before boarding the ship, snatching Nyah&#x27;s controller for Chani, but this attempt is thwarted by Nyah&#x27;s mind control powers. Carter is released by Nyah, and they both return to the bar, where she announces that she will destroy the inn and kill everyone within when she leaves for London. However she allows for one man to go with her in order to escape death. The men draw lots and Carter wins the draw, still hoping to enact Hennessy&#x27;s plan to destroy the spaceship.

At the last minute, Justin, alone at the bar and now free from mind control when Nyah returns, offers to go with her of his own free will. After take-off he successfully sabotages Nyah&#x27;s flying saucer, sacrificing himself to save the men of Earth, and atoning for the death of his wife. The survivors celebrate their escape with a drink at the bar.

==Production==
In an interview with Frank J. Dello Stritto, screenwriter John Chartres Mather claimed that &quot;Devil Girl from Mars&quot; came about while he was working with The Danzigers, who were producing &quot;Calling Scotland Yard&quot; (1953) that appeared as both an American television series and as cinema featurettes in Great Britain and the British Commonwealth. When production finished ahead of schedule, Mather says he was ordered to use up the remaining film studio time already booked and paid for by working on a feature film for the Danzigers. The interview also states that Patricia Laffan&#x27;s devil girl costume was economically made by designer John Sutcliffe.

The film was made at Shepperton Studios with sets designed by the art director Norman G. Arnold. It was made on a very low budget, with no retakes except in cases where the actual film stock became damaged; it was shot over a period of three weeks, often filming well into the night. Actress Hazel Court later said: &quot;I remember great fun on the set. It was like a repertory company acting that film&quot;.

The robot, named Chani, was constructed by Jack Whitehead and was operated by a human being.

The alien Klaatu, posing as &quot;Mr. Carpenter&quot; in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), was intended by screenwriter Edmund H. North to evoke Jesus Christ, and there are indications that the Martian woman Nyah was intended to evoke an anti-Virgin Mary image.

&quot;Devil Girl from Mars&quot;″s sound editor was Gerry Anderson (credited as Gerald Anderson), later to create UK television series such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. To save time and money, composer Edwin Astley reused his &quot;Saber of London&quot; TV series score for the film.

== Critical reception ==
At the time of the film&#x27;s release Gavin Lambert wrote in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;: This primitive British effort at science-fiction is quite enjoyably ludicrous, mainly on account of Patricia Laffan&#x27;s splendid Nyah. Clothed in black silk tights, a black cloak, a metallurgical-looking wig and walled in make-up, she moves with the air of a sleep-walker, never looking at the person to whom she is talking and speaking her lines – particularly those describing the scientific marvels of her planet – in an impatient monotone, as if contemptuous of any meaning they may, from time to time, contain. One would like to see Nyah again, preferably in a serial. The romance of mannequin and journalist, also, will have its appeal to connoisseurs of life among the English. Settings, dialogue, characterisation and special effects are of a low order; but even their modest unreality has its charm. There is really no fault in this film that one would like to see eliminated. Everything, in its way, is quite perfect.Contemporaneously &quot;Kine Weekly&quot; said:Effective interplay of character establishes human interest without curbing essential spectacle, and the ending literally goes with a bang. At once ingenious stunt ofering and artful woman&#x27;s stuff, its conquest of both worlds stands it in good stead. ...The picture keeps the strange and frightening &#x27;flying saucer&#x27; at a respectable distance, but resourceful camera work gives the illusion validity ... and the characters are not dwarfed by the gimmicks. Although the shots of the rocket-ship landing, departing and disintegrating are arresting, they are not introduced at the expense of human interest. The sacrifice made by Albert is the heart of its sensational and salutary matter.&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; columnist Doug Pratt called &quot;Devil Girl from Mars&quot; a &quot;delightfully bad movie&quot;. The &quot;acting is really bad and the whole thing is so much fun you want to run to your local community theatre group and have them put it on next, instead of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;.&quot; 

American film reviewer Leonard Maltin said the film is a &quot;hilariously solemn, high camp British imitation of U.S. cheapies&quot;.

&quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;bonkers fun&quot;.

In &quot;Going to Mars: The Stories of the People Behind NASA&#x27;s Mars Missions Past, Present, and Future,&quot; Muirhead et al describe the film as &quot;an undeniably awful but oddly interesting&quot; film. They noted that the plot was &quot;more a reflection of the 1950s view of politics and the era&#x27;s inequality of the sexes than a thoughtful projection of present or future possibilities&quot;. 

In &quot;Mars: A Tour of the Human Imagination,&quot; Eric S. Rabkin likens the character Nyah to a dominatrix and even a neo-Nazi. He said of the film that, &quot;a host of charged images and subconscious fears&quot; are handled with a broad camp irony. Otherwise, &quot;without some underlying psychological engagement, how could anyone sit through a movie so badly made&quot;?

British film critic Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Absurd attempt to cash in on the then new science fiction craze. The budget matches the imagination.&quot;

In &quot;British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959&quot; David Quinlan rated the film as &quot;average&quot;, writing: &quot;Talky science-film runs like an early serial.&quot;

Chibnall and McFarlane in &quot;The British &#x27;B&#x27; Film&quot; wrote: Clad as a dominatrix in leather cap, cloak and stiletto boots, [Nyah] is a genuinely shocking figure in the staid world of British film-making of the time: it is as if the underworld of S&amp;M fetishism had suddenly surfaced, and with it the collective unconscious of the nation. Backed by the mechanised might of her faithful robot (resembling a fridge on legs) she imparts a sexual charge that the film&#x27;s scenario struggles to contain, and gives a wholly different spin to the desire expressed by another of the inn&#x27;s visitors, the prodigal metropolitan model played by Hazel Court, to spend more time in the country, find the right man, have children. Nyah is an eroticised threat to a patriarchy that was increasingly troubled in the post-war years. She comes to turn the proud men of Earth into sex slaves for her matriarchal order. ... &quot;Devil Girl From Mars&quot; is, therefore, not only a camp classic but an ideologically significant moment in 1950s British cinema.

==Legacy==
The film inspired Hugo and Nebula award-winning author Octavia E. Butler to begin writing science fiction. After watching the motion picture at age 12, she declared that she could write something better.

The Los Angeles avant-garde artist Gronk lists this film as the crucial factor that guided him in his career choice.
