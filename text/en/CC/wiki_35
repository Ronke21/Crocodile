<text>Mohammad Shah (; born Mohammad Mirza; 5 January 1808 – 5 September 1848) was the third Qajar &quot;shah&quot; of Iran from 1834 to 1848, inheriting the throne from his grandfather, Fath-Ali Shah. From a young age, Mohammad Mirza was under the tutelage of Haji Mirza Aqasi, a local dervish from Tabriz whose teachings influenced the young prince to become a Sufi-king later in his life. After his father Abbas Mirza died in 1833, Mohammad Mirza became the crown prince of Iran and was assigned with the governorship of Azarbaijan. After the death of Fath-Ali Shah in 1834, some of his sons including Hossein Ali Mirza and Ali Mirza Zel as-Soltan rose up as claimants to the throne. With the support of English and Russian forces, Mohammad Shah suppressed the rebellious princes and asserted his authority.

Mohammad Shah dismissed and executed his tactful premier, Abol-Qasem Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, and appointed his favourite, Haji Mirza Aqasi, as the grand vizier. The new shah&#x27;s main goal was to reestablish the rule of the Iranian government in the rebellious city of Herat. In 1837 he marched to Herat and laid a futile siege on the city, which was eventually withdrawn when the British government threatened to invade Iran. On his return, Mohammad suppressed a revolt in Isfahan led by the major clergy figure Mohammad Bagher Shafti. Through British-Russian mediation, he concluded the Second Treaty of Erzurum with the Ottoman Empire, after initially wanting retaliation for the sack of Khorramshahr by the Ottoman governor of Baghdad.

Due to British pressure, Mohammad Shah reluctantly prohibited the slave trade through the Persian Gulf, but still allowed the possession and trade of slaves in the country. During the rise of the Bábism faith and its prophet Báb, Mohammad refused to persecute them despite the &quot;fatwa&quot; (decree) imposed by Shiite clerics. Diplomatic relations between France and Iran recommenced during his reign. Mohammad suffered from gout, which overshadowed his reign. In the final years of his life, his physical health deteriorated, leading to his death from a combination of gout and erysipelas on 4 September 1848 at the age of 40 after fourteen years of reign. He was buried at the Fatima Masumeh Shrine in Qom and was succeeded by his son, Naser al-Din Shah.

As a ruler, Mohammad Shah did not receive praise. He was labeled as a figurehead king for Aqasi, whom he was highly dependent on. Mohammad was devoted to both Aqasi and his teachings on Sufism; he became a willing sustainer of Sufis, and sought spiritual guidance in mystical rituals instead of the &quot;marji&#x27;i taqlīd&quot; (Shiite clerics). The &quot;ulama&quot; grew as his firmest rivals, who challenged his legitimacy and authority throughout his short reign. Mohammad enlarged the Qajar bureaucracy, and filled governmental positions with Aqasi&#x27;s Sufi friends and companions, thus establishing a corrupt administration that saw its peak during his son&#x27;s reign. Mohammad Shah was the last Qajar king who attended the battlefield in a foreign war, and was also the last to use the title &quot;Ghazi&quot; (warrior of Islam) for his activity in the Iran-Russia war and for suppressing the rebellion in Isfahan.

== Background ==
The Russian Empire invaded the Caucasus in 1795, when Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, was reconquering the eastern provinces of Iran. Thus, Agha Mohammad was forced to withdraw his army and march towards the Caucasus without consolidating his rule in the east, including in Herat. The Russian army retreated before he could reach the Caucasus, and Agha Mohammad was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha. Though his realm never reached the far east of Greater Khorasan, he was recognised as the Shahanshah by Ahmad Shah Durrani, who proclaimed his allegiance in a public &quot;khutba&quot;. Agha Mohammad Khan was succeeded by his nephew, Fath-Ali Shah. During the reign of Fath-Ali Shah, tensions in Iranian-Russian relations escalated and turned into two full scale wars which saw the defeat of Iran in several stages. According to the treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay, large parts of the realm were ceded and Iran was forced to make many concessions to Russia. The war also tarnished Iran&#x27;s global image as being a weak state with unstable borders. 

In Europe, the British Empire had emerged, gained sovereignty over India and viewed Iran as a strong barrier to prevent Russia from gaining access to the region. On the other hand, it was well known that the Russian Empire, in its quest to reach the open waters in southern Iran, intended to expand its sovereignty over Iranian territory. Thus, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah, the Iranian political stage was a competition between the Russian and British governments to receive numerous concessions and expand political influence.

In the years between the two wars with Russia, a conflict broke out between Iran and the Ottoman Empire in 1821, which ended with the military victory of Iran and the conclusion of the First Treaty of Erzurum in 1823. The treaty did not resolve fundamental differences, the most important of which was the unclear borders of the two nations. There were also disputes such as the persecution of Iranian pilgrims to Shiite holy sites by the Ottomans and the citizenship of border tribes. Another contentious issue was the trade rivalry between Khorramshahr and Basra.

From the beginning of his reign, Fath-Ali Shah tried to present himself as a pious king in the eyes of the Shiite clerics and went so far as to declare his monarchy a subrogation for the &quot;ulama&quot;. During his reign, Isfahan once again took on the image of the religious capital of Iran, and the government left Shiite clerics free to persecute religious minorities. Sufis suffered the most. Fath-Ali Shah took it upon himself to lead their persecution, for example, ordering the &quot;suffocation&quot; of the Sufi leaders of Tabriz.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Mohammad Mirza was born on 5 January 1808 in Tabriz. He was the eldest son of crown prince Abbas Mirza and Galin Khanum, daughter of Mirza Mohammad Khan Qajar Davallu. During his childhood and youth, Mohammad Mirza was a &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;shy&quot; boy with no apparent political ambitions. He completed his traditional princely education in Tabriz and became a skilled calligrapher and painter, he learned the latter from the Scottish artist Robert Ker Porter. His level of knowledge, however, was limited compared to that of his brothers, especially Djahangir Mirza and Farhad Mirza, who excelled in writing and other &quot;branches of science&quot;. A turning point in his life was the arrival of the local dervish, Haji Mirza Aqasi, in his father&#x27;s household. By the orders of Abbas Mirza&#x27;s majordomo, Mirza Bozorg Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, Aqasi was appointed the chief tutor to Mohammad, who quickly became a devotee of his Sufi teachings. Abol-Qasem Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, another of Mohammad&#x27;s tutors, tried to dissuade Mohammad from studying under Aqasi, but Aqasi&#x27;s influence on Mohammad increased.

When Mohammad Mirza was 12 years old, Fath-Ali Shah summoned him to Tehran to marry Malek Jahan Khanom, the daughter of Mohammad Qasim Khan Zahir al-Dawla, to establish solidarity between the royal family and the Davallu cadet branch of the Qajar dynasty. The marriage, which took place in September 1819, was loveless. As a result of the recurring deaths of their infants, Mohammad Mirza developed resentment towards Malek Jahan. Of their children, only Naser al-Din Mirza, who later became the crown prince and then king of Iran; and Ezzat ed-Dowleh, who married Amir Kabir, later the chief minister of Naser al-Din Shah; survived into adulthood.

=== Early military career ===
The Second Russo-Iranian War began with the declaration of &quot;jihad&quot; by the Shiite clerics. During the war, Abbas Mirza sent Mohammad Mirza with an army consisting of the tribes of Khajevandi and Abdul Maliki to protect the fortress of Ganja. There, under the command of Amir Khan Sardar, Abbas Mirza&#x27;s maternal uncle, Mohammad launched an attack on the Russian army. In the resulting battle, Amir Khan was killed and Mohammad was severely defeated and forced to retreat; he, however, was praised for his efforts during the war and was nicknamed a &quot;Gazi&quot; (warrior of Islam). After the war, Fath Ali Shah appointed Abbas Mirza to rule Khorasan and regulate the security of that area, which suffered constant raids by Prince Kamran, whom the Iranian government had previously appointed as the governor of Herat and who now styled himself &quot;Shah&quot;. Mohammad Mirza also accompanied his father on this trip. In one of his missions, Mohammad released nearly 20,000 Iranians held captive by Central Asian Sunni tribes; in honor of this victory, he named his newborn child &quot;Naser al-Din&quot; (defender of the faith).

Abbas Mirza spent two years in Khorasan suppressing rebel khans; Khiva and Herat supported these revolts and promised aid but Mohammad&#x27;s victories discouraged them. In 1832, Abbas Mirza summoned Kamran Shah, the ruler of Herat, to pay tribute, but Kamran instead sent his vizier Yar Mohammad Khan. Feeling insulted, Abbas Mirza sent Mohammad Mirza with an army to Herat. Mohammad Mirza advanced directly to Herat and prepared for a siege. Meanwhile, Abbas Mirza was on his way with reinforcements when he suddenly died in Mashhad. Upon hearing the news, Mohammad Mirza and Abol-Qasem Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, who was also a leading figure in the siege, were forced to negotiate with Kamran. It was agreed that Kamran would accept the sovereignty of Iran, pay 15,000 tomans in gold and fifty Kashmir shawls, and release the Iranian prisoners who had been captured during the war. Mohammad appointed his brother Ghahreman Mirza as the governor of Khorasan and, with Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, went to Tehran to claim the title of crown prince.

== Accession ==
At Nowruz (Iranian New Year, which is held at the March equinox) of 1834, Mohammad Mirza was appointed the crown prince and took the governorship of Azarbaijan—the office of his father—and left Tehran for Tabriz. As crown prince, Mohammad Mirza was under the complete influence of Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, on whose orders, he imprisoned four of his brothers, including Djahangir Mirza and Khosrow Mirza, in Hamadan and later blinded them to invalidate their claims to the throne. The appointment of Mohammad as the crown prince angered Fath-ali Shah&#x27;s fifth son Hossein Ali Mirza, the Prince-Governor of Fars, who thought the appointment would deprive him of his rights and was a sign of submission to Russian demands.

In October 1834, Fath-Ali Shah, with the intention of collecting 200,000 tomans of tax arrears from Hossein Ali Mirza, went to Fars but died &quot;en route&quot; at Isfahan. Couriers were quickly sent to Tabriz but otherwise, the shah&#x27;s death remained secret. His body was then taken to the Fatima Masumeh Shrine for burial; only then was the death publicly announced. As expected, his death sparked revolts across the country, and a number of princes, including Hossein Ali Mirza in Shiraz and Ali Mirza Zel as-Soltan in Tehran, proclaimed themselves kings.

In early November, John Campbell and Comte Ivan Simonich, the British and Russian envoys, arrived in Tabriz to proclaim their support for Mohammad Mirza. They provided him an army led by Col. Henry Lindsay Bethune that set off for Tehran, where Ali Mirza had proclaimed himself king. Mohammad&#x27;s army met 15,000 of Ali Mirza&#x27;s men, who were led by Ali&#x27;s brother Emamverdi Mirza, at Takestan, west of Qazvin. After a brief confrontation, Emamverdi Mirza sought to surrender and pledge fealty to Mohammad. The new king agreed to waive his uncles&#x27; punishment. In early 1835, Mohammad entered the capital with Qa&#x27;em-Maqam, his courtiers and Russian and British ambassadors, and was crowned king on 14 January.

In February 1835, Mohammad sent an army under the command of Manuchehr Khan Gorji to liberate Isfahan from Hossein Ali Mirza&#x27;s forces, who were under the command of his brother Shoja al-Saltanah. After reconquering Isfahan, Manuchehr Khan Gorji marched to Shiraz, where he captured Hossein Ali Mirza and ended his rebellion. Hossein Ali was imprisoned in Ardabil and soon died of cholera; with his defeat, the other rebel princes surrendered their claims and recognized Mohammad as the king of Iran.

== Reign ==

=== Early years ===

Mohammad Shah appointed Qa&#x27;em-Maqam as his grand vizier. Qa&#x27;em-Maqam&#x27;s efforts in budgeting and his disdain for the courtiers made him an unpopular figure in the court. As soon as he had become the grand vizier, Qa&#x27;em-Maqam had the royal princes swear an oath of fealty to Mohammad, otherwise he would have them imprisoned. This fate befell many Qajar princes, such as Mahmud Mirza, the governor of Kashan, who refused to relinquish his claim and thus lost his title and wealth. Soon, Qa&#x27;em-Maqam was attacked by rivals, the most prominent being Allahyar Khan Asef ol-Dowleh—Mohammad Shah&#x27;s uncle from the Davallu tribe—and a coalition led by Aqasi. Qa&#x27;em-Maqam&#x27;s adversaries soon included British envoy John Campbell, who had expected grand privileges for his contribution to Mohammad&#x27;s enthronement but had been denied by Qa&#x27;em-Maqam. To reduce British influence over the court, Qa&#x27;em-Maqam had tried to improve Iran&#x27;s relations with the Ottoman Empire. His rivals, with slanderous accusations, urged Mohammad to have Qa&#x27;em-Maqam ousted from his position and Mohammad eventually agreed to do so. On 22 June 1835, he arrested and imprisoned Qa&#x27;em-Maqam in Negarestan Palace, and four days later he ordered Qa&#x27;em-Maqam&#x27;s execution.

Mohammad Shah then spent a few months without a grand vizier. Campbell expressed his support for Mirza Abolhassan Khan Ilchi while his courtiers supported Abdollah Amin al-Dowleh, an erstwhile grand vizier of Fath-Ali Shah, but Mohammad chose Aqasi, who filled this position for most of Mohammad&#x27;s reign. By this time, Mohammad&#x27;s health had become a concern for the kingdom&#x27;s future and the four-year-old Naser al-Din Mirza was appointed the crown prince. Mohammad Shah granted the governorship of Azarbaijan, which the Qajar kings bestowed upon their heir apparent, to his firstborn son Naser al-Din and appointed his brother Ghahreman Mirza as Naser al-Din&#x27;s regent. Ghahreman Mirza was in close contact with the Russian government. After he died in 1841, Mohammad appointed his last-surviving full-brother, Bahman Mirza as his son&#x27;s regent in 1842.

In 1837, a rebellion broke out in Kerman, led by Hassan Ali Shah, better known as Agha Khan I, the leader of the Nizari Ismailis. The Nizari Muslims, though few in number, lived in Iran under the leadership of Hassan Ali Shah, who asserted his power by marrying Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s daughter Sarveh Jahan Khanum, and acquiring the title of Aga Khan. When Mohammad Shah ascended the throne, on the advice of Qa&#x27;em Maqam, he had appointed Agha Khan as the governor of Kerman, a rebellious state that was governed by Shoja al-Saltanah, a brother of Hossein Ali Mirza. Agha Khan pacified the state but his governorship was short-lived; in 1837, he was recalled to Tehran and was replaced with Firouz Mirza, the shah&#x27;s brother. Agha Khan declared a rebellion against the shah, and withdrew with his forces to Bam. Mohammad Shah sent an army under the command of Sourab Khan; they besieged Bam and took the severely injured brother of Agha Khan prisoner. After eight months, Agha Khan surrendered and was imprisoned; his belongings were plundered and he was not allowed to receive his religious dues sent from India, Khurasan and Badakhshan. Agha Khan was a prisoner of the shah until 1838, when he was allowed to retreat to his familial lands in Mahallat.

=== Herat campaign ===
After asserting his authority, Mohammad Shah&#x27;s main objective was to annex Herat. This alarmed Kamran Shah and prompted him to attempt to gather the neighboring tribes such as the Jamshidi, Tumani and Hazara in Herat to fight Mohammad in the event of a military campaign. These mobilizations alarmed the British government, which sent Alexander Burnes and Eldred Pottinger to Kabul and Herat respectively. Iran wanted to retake Herat partly because of Mohammad&#x27;s desire to liberate the Iranians who had been taken prisoner by the Sunni tribes who lived near Khorasan. Conquest of Herat was also the first step in a plan to extend Iran&#x27;s influence up to the Amu Darya river. In late 1836, Mohammad ordered his army to be mustered for the following spring. This gave John McNeill, the British envoy in Iran, time to arrange a treaty in which Herat would resume paying tributes. Yar Mohammad Khan, however, would not tolerate Iranian sovereignty, and Mohammad Shah would not withdraw unless the city was conquered.

In 1837, Mohammad Shah marched on Herat. British officers were expelled from the Iranian army and the British embassy was closed. Mohammad took personal command of Iran&#x27;s 80,000 troops, while Kamran Shah had gathered a few thousand poorly equipped soldiers. The ruler of Herat had little hope of resisting Mohammad Shah, because the city&#x27;s population, who had been terrorized by their overlord and dispirited by economic decline, were unlikely to put up any fight. Also, the crumbling fortifications of the city&#x27;s walls were in disrepair and would not withstand an assault. Kamran Shah&#x27;s only source of hope was the support of Sher Mohammad Khan Hazara, the Amir of Qala e Naw, who vowed to fight to the death for Kamran Shah, and brought about 4,000 foot soldiers and numerous horsemen to Herat&#x27;s army. Sher Mohammad Khan Hazara also organized an alliance between the Aimaq, Uzbek and Turkman tribes under the banner of Sunni Islam. Thus, under the leadership of Sher Mohammad and Kamran Shah&#x27;s son Nader Mirza, ten to twelve thousand horsemen had assembled around Qala-e Naw and threatened to attack Iran&#x27;s borders.

On 28 October, Mohammad Shah camped at Torbat-e Jam, and in order to counterattack, he ordered 12,000 of his best soldiers under the command of Mohammad Khan Asef al-Dowleh, the governor of Khorasan, to march to Qala e Naw. By the middle of November, he had seized the city and its surroundings, dividing Sher Mohammad&#x27;s army into two; one part was camped in Kushk under the command of Mohammad Zaman Jamshidi and the other was already retreating to Herat. The Jamshidi army faced Asef al-Dowleh&#x27;s men and were scattered in a desperate fight; two to three hundred men were killed and as many taken prisoner. Despite their victory, the Iranian army faced difficulties, suffering from the winter cold that reached the mountains much earlier than it reached Herat, and a shortage of supplies that could only be purchased at high prices. Eventually, Asaf al-Dowleh and his men marched through the mountains to Bala Murghab and from there to Maymana, where he defeated another host of the Afghan army under the command of Sher Mohammad Khan. After this victory, Asaf al-Dowleh sent an ambassador to his opponent&#x27;s camp, and promised them freedom and wealth if they surrendered to Mohammad Shah. His offer was received positively and Sher Mohammad agreed to send two of his sons to Herat to proffer their submission to Mohammad Shah.

On 23 November, Mohammad Shah with a part of his army reached the outskirts of Herat, where they faced fierce resistance from the defenders but eventually forced them to retreat behind the city walls. Mohammad Shah set up his camp south-east of Herat and began a long siege of the city. The Iranian army were divided in opinion; Aqasi wanted to wait for Russian aid whereas Mirza Aqa Khan Nuri had argued for crushing the city walls. Mohammad Shah faced problems feeding his men; his army quickly ran out of supplies, and the lines back to Mashhad were insecure and often impassable. The fields around Herat had already been harvested by the residents and the remains had been destroyed. The problem was only solved after the spring of 1838, when Mohammad Shah ordered his men to plant their crops.

In March 1838, John McNeill arrived at Mohammad Shah&#x27;s camp as the British representative; he failed to dissuade Mohammad and thus on 7 June 1838, he withdrew from Herat. Ten days later, the British Indian fleet from Bombay occupied Kharg Island and threatened further military action. Under pressure to end the campaign, Mohammad Shah ordered a full-scale assault on Herat, which failed with many casualties. The British sent an ultimatum threatening war if the siege continued. The Russians abandoned Mohammad Shah&#x27;s cause and withdrew their support. These circumstances, along with news of rebellions, led Mohammad Shah to give up his campaign and end the siege. Although he had failed to conquer Herat, Mohammad&#x27;s army still occupied Ghurian and other forts; and a number of Afghan members of the Barakzai dynasty such as Kohan Dil Khan of the Principality of Kandahar would remain loyal to Mohammad Shah.

=== Rebellion in Isfahan ===
Mohammad Bagher Shafti was one of the most distinguished religious figures of his time; with a fortune of two and a half million francs (equivalent to million French francs in ). Shafti rebelled against Mohammad Shah in 1834, when he tried to seize the city Isfahan from its Prince-Governor Sayf ol-Dowleh. Over four years, Shafti took control of the city&#x27;s Luti population, and in 1838, he rebelled against the governor of the city, Gholam Hossein Khan Sepahdar, and therefore Mohammad Shah. Shafti&#x27;s men, who were known for their acts of murder, robbery and rape, looted the city and took the booty to the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan. There, Shafti declared their leader Ramazan as Ramazan Shah and ordered the striking of coins in his name. The roots of this revolt lay in a letter from McNiell to Shafti, in which he implied the cause of the war in Herat was the Shah&#x27;s warmongering and obduracy. The rebellion was supported by a Safavid descendant called Nawab Safavi, which further encouraged the rebels to kill the city&#x27;s deputy governor.

As a result, between 1838 and 1840, Isfahan was in the hands of rebels, especially the Lutis, whose numbers were increasing as the city&#x27;s poor population joined their cause. To end their rebellion, Mohammad Shah went to Isfahan with 60,000 troops on the return journey from Herat. It was unprecedented for the shah to take arms against the state&#x27;s clergy, especially Shafti, who was considered a clergy leader and because Isfahan was regarded as the religious capital of Iran. Modern historian Homa Nategh argued that this act was a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

Upon reaching the city, Mohammad Shah ordered the cannons to bombard Isfahan. Shafti, fearing great losses, opened the city&#x27;s northern gate and the Lutis deserted from the southern gate. Mohammad Shah triumphantly entered the city and instantly ordered the execution of the remaining Lutis. He could not punish Shafti with any extreme measures but had exiled his son to Astrabad. The Luti leader Ramazan Shah died under torture, and of his men, 240 were killed and 400 were arrested. Mohammad Shah set up a court for people to recount the Lutis&#x27; crimes. He took the lands and the properties Shafti and the Lutis had usurped, and incorporated them in his demesne lands. Harsh penalties were imposed to ensure stability and fear, and to prevent future rebellions. Mohammad Shah celebrated his victory greatly, trying to erase the memory of his failure in Herat. To declare Shafti&#x27;s cause blasphemy, Mohammad Shah reaffirmed the title Ghazi (the warrior of Islam).

=== The Second Treaty of Erzurum ===
Hostilities with the Ottomans and tensions over the borderlands of the two empires had not been resolved by the treaty of Erzurum and later led to incidents during Mohammad Shah&#x27;s reign that pushed him to start a war, such as the sack of Khorramshahr by Ali Reza Pasha, the governor of Baghdad, in 1837. In the early 1840s, peace in the frontier of Iran and the Ottoman Empire became a prioritized European project. Negotiations between the two nations began in 1842 in Erzurum, a sizeable frontier town. The Iranian commission included Mirza Taqi Khan Farahani, later known as Amir Kabir, whose involvement in the treaty got him the attention of political circles. On the Ottoman side was Enveri Sadullah Efendi, a member of the Supreme Council of Justice, whose arrogance and occasional undiplomatic language created so many problems that he was once considered to be replaced. Negotiations began on 15 May 1843; Mohammad Shah had demanded that the Iranian plenipotentiaries resolve the negotiations quickly or he would raise arms against the Ottoman Empire. Negotiations lasted for four years, mostly because of delays caused by political and military crises such as the Ottoman massacre of 22,000 Shi&#x27;i Iranian pilgrims on the road to Karbala that caused the suspension of the negotiations for three months.

Negotiations were resumed by British and Russian mediators. Territorial restitution was confined to the cities of Khorramshahr, Zohab and Sulaymaniyah, and the Iranian dominance over the Shatt al-Arab river. Ownership of Zohab was a heated argument between negotiators; the town, which was insignificant in itself, had been captured by Mohamad Ali Mirza Dowlatshah, the firstborn son of Fath-Ali Shah, during the Ottoman-Persian war of 1821. Iran had retained sovereignty over it even though it had agreed to cede it in the First Treaty of Erzurum. Farahani suggested that Zohab be divided between the two nations, but the Iranian party later agreed to cede the town to the Ottomans who, in return, would forsake their desire to dominate the Shatt al-Arab&#x27;s trade route. When the commissioners began discussing Khorramshahr, Farahani declared that the town had always been part of Khuzistan and demanded £1 million (equivalent to £ million in ) in compensation for the 1837 sack of the city. Despite the Ottoman protests and arguments, Khorramshahr was determined to be a part of Iran after Farahani&#x27;s firm efforts.

In May 1846, the first drafts of the treaty were written. Russia and Britain were to draw up a map of the border areas, and both parties would accept it. In the meantime, Farahani fell ill and a riot broke out in Erzurum, his house was looted and two of his companions were killed by rebels. Negotiations were suspended for several months. The Ottoman government formally apologized to Iran, imprisoned 300 rioters and paid 15,000 tomans in compensation. Afterwards, negotiations resumed and resulted in a treaty with nine articles. The Ottoman party, however, were unsatisfied with the outcome and threatened to leave the negotiations. The mediators, determined to avoid such results, secretly gave assurances to the Ottomans. On 31 May 1847, Farahani and Efendi signed the treaty and left Erzurum, and on 26 June, Mohammad Shah also ratified the treaty.

While the tensions seemed to be resolved, the Ottoman government had secretly added three more articles to the treaty with the support of British and Russian ambassadors. Based on these articles, Iran&#x27;s rights to the Shatt al-Arab were revoked and those to Khorramshahr were reduced. Contrary to the agreements, control of Shatt al-Arab, except for a few islands, was handed to the Ottoman Empire. At the end of January 1848, Mirza Javad, a courier from Tehran, arrived in Istanbul with Mohammad Shah&#x27;s ratified copies of the treaty; the Ottoman government insisted they would not ratify the treaty unless the shah agreed to the new articles. Not wanting to make Mohammad Shah suspicious, the British and Russian ambassadors persuaded Mirza Mohammad-Ali Khan Shirazi, Iran&#x27;s envoy to France who was in Istanbul at the time, to ratify the new articles, alternatively called the &quot;Explanatory Note&quot;. Mirza Mohammad-Ali agreed, but only if the ambassadors signed an official statement in which they would inform Mohammad Shah that the new articles were necessary for maintaining the treaty. Mohammad Shah did not accept the new terms and declared the treaty false and invalid. The tensions between Iran and the Ottomans persisted even after the fall of the Ottoman Empire when the newly established country of Iraq inherited the Ottoman claims against Iran.

===Prohibition of slavery in the Persian Gulf ===

In the 1840s, an estimated four to five thousand slaves were sold in the Persian Gulf each year. When Justin Sheil succeeded John McNiel as the envoy to Iran in 1844, he and his wife decided to act against the slavery. He sent a letter to Aqasi and pleaded for an abolition. Mohammad Shah, however, did not respond to this diplomatic pressure, so Sheil brought up the moral aspect of slavery, emphasizing its negative impacts on the African population. Mohammad Shah remained unmoved and said abolition would contradict the Islamic tradition. Sheil further argued his points but Mohammad responded that such interference would undermine the diplomatic relations between the two nations.

In late 1847, Sheil was recalled to London and replaced with Colonel Francis Farrant, who also negotiated for abolition with Aqasi. Farrant was more successful, especially due to the newly signed treaty of Erzurum that had put him in a good light for the grand vizier. Farrant argued that if the Ottoman Empire could abolish slavery in their nation, Iranians could do the same. The argument appealed to Aqasi, who suggested it to Mohammad Shah. Mohammad wrote this to Farrant regarding the abolition of slavery in the Ottoman Empire:

Between the religions of Europe and our religion there is great distinction and difference, and we cannot observe or join in matters which are in accordance with their religion and in opposition to ours, why we wrote that the exalted English government should make enquiries of the Turkish government on this subject, was because that government being a Mahomedan state and in that country the traffic in slaves being much more extensive than any where else, we might observe what answer it will give, that then we may give a reply which should not be opposed to tenets of the Mahomedan faith.

Mohammad Shah agreed to the abolition of the slave trade through the Persian Gulf, but owning slaves and trading them over land was still allowed. On Mohammad&#x27;s behest, Aqasi sent three letters to the governors of Fars, Kerman, and Isfahan, ordering the governors not to partake in the slave trade in the Persian Gulf. On the advice of both Sheil and Farrant, Aqasi also approached the major &quot;ulama&quot; of Tehran to ask their consent should the slave traders accuse them of blasphemy. The results were unfavorable; most of the &quot;ulama&quot; regarded slavery as legal according to Mohammedan law. Mohammad&#x27;s order to prohibit the slave trade was not impactful and the trade continued until final abolishment in 1929.

=== Last years and death ===
Throughout his life, Mohammad Shah had suffered from gout and endured its recurrent attacks. Influenced by Aqasi, he had refused to be treated by European doctors, and instead trusted the traditional treatment of a fraudster, which gave him a severe paroxysm, due to which Mohammad became so weak that rumours of his impending death spread throughout Tehran. He recovered but lost the use of one leg. Aqasi, however, refused to let any foreign-trained physicians, especially English ones, approach Mohammad; only two French doctors, Dr. Labat and Dr. Ernest Cloquet, were allowed to treat him. Under Labat&#x27;s care, Mohammad recovered somewhat but was still so feeble that he could only move with the help of two persons. Becoming infirm and debilitated, Mohammad lost the will to rule; he handed over the government to Aqasi, leading to political and social turmoil.

Mohammad&#x27;s dire health prompted the foreign powers to declare their support for Mohammad&#x27;s eldest son Naser al-Din Mirza in February 1842. Bahman Mirza, who had previously served as the regent for Naser al-Din Mirza, began mobilizing forces at Tabriz, in hopes of becoming Naser al-Din&#x27;s regent once again after Mohammad&#x27;s death. Bahman Mirza had support from Count Medem and John McNeill, the Russian and British envoys respectively, but the British withdrew their support when Sheil succeeded McNeill; but the Russians continued to consider Bahman Mohammad&#x27;s successor. To counteract the Russians, in 1845, Aqasi arranged a marriage for Naser al-Din Mirza with the daughter of Ahmad Ali Mirza, a son of Fath-Ali Shah. This wedding brought the young prince into the political spectrum. Mohammad&#x27;s health slightly improved, and the realm and its succession seemed stable and secure. Rebellions, however, broke out in Khorasan, one of which was led by Hasan Khan Salar in support of Bahman Mirza&#x27;s claim; another was led by Allah-Qoli Khan Ilkhani, a grandson of Fath-Ali Shah through his mother and a protégé of Aqasi to press his own claim. Both rebellions continued after Mohammad&#x27;s death into the early years of Naser al-Din Shah&#x27;s rule.

After Mohammad abdicated his role in the government, Aqasi&#x27;s influence on him increased. Aqasi, now Iran&#x27;s most powerful figure, was also becoming avaricious in his position and was less inclined to govern because he was addicted to opium. Mohammad, thinking highly of Aqasi, was happy to let him govern as he liked. In mid-to-late 1848, Mohammad suffered a combination of gout and erysipelas, from which it was clear he would not recover. 
Mohammad Shah Qajar died at around 21:00 on 4 September 1848. He was buried at the Fatima Masumeh Shrine located in Qom and his tomb was placed near the shrine&#x27;s sanctuary.

== Policies ==

=== Religion ===
For his patronage of Sufism, Mohammad Shah was compared to Ismail I, the Safavid shah who had made Twelver Shi&#x27;ism the official religion of Iran. Mohammad denoted Sufi Islam as the rival of the Shi&#x27;ia and &quot;ulama&quot;. The Sufis, who were persecuted during Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s reign, could now freely promote their beliefs. Mohammad was very dependent on his Sufi teacher Aqasi and gave court positions to Aqasi&#x27;s Sufi friends like Mirza Mahdi Khui, who became chief scribe of the court. Concurrent with their new patronage, Sufis took the idea of the Hidden Imam from the Shi&#x27;ia and connected it to their Sufi saints. Figures such as Safi-ad-din Ardabili became messengers of the Hidden Imam and the Sufi &quot;murshids&quot; (spiritual guides) were the only knowledgeable people who could read these communications, often through dreaming. The Sufis despised acts of torture and violence; when Aqasi became the grand vizier, he pleaded for their reduction. Mohammad would not accept these requests in his early years, arguing that a culprit does not deserve sympathy, but as he aged and grew weaker from gout, he ordered the complete abolition of torture.

Mohammad&#x27;s approach to the Shi&#x27;ia clergy was one of hostility and conflict. He abandoned Fath-Ali Shah&#x27;s attempts to meet the demands of the clergy. He never asked for a theoretical acknowledgment of his coronation and was more inclined to search his spiritual guide among the dervishes and Sufis than among the &quot;ulama&quot; of the state. On 24 November 1842, Mohammad issued a firman abolishing the rights of taking shelter in sanctuaries. He would constantly try to undermine the orthodox &quot;ulama&quot;&#x27;s position through the promotion of Sufism, and with the rise of Báb and Bábism. When Sayyid Ali Muhammad Shirazi first claimed to be the Báb (gateway to the Hidden Imam), the &quot;ulama&quot; declared a fatwa saying that he must be killed. Mohammad, however, called Báb to Tehran and promised him shelter. This alarmed Aqasi, who had Báb sent to Maku in Azerbaijan, where he was kept under confinement. Facing dissent from Mohammad, however, Aqasi took no drastic measures against Báb and his followers.

Although Mohammad had no enmity towards any branches of Christianity, he preferred to allow the French Lazarist missionaries into Iran rather than the English Anglicans. In the hope of bringing modern education to the nation, he issued an edict that allowed missionaries to open schools. The head of the Lazarists was Eugène Boré, who in 1839 opened a school in Tabriz with both Christian and Muslim students. Boré&#x27;s school provoked unrest among the &quot;ulama&quot; of Tabriz, but as he was under the protection of Mohammad, they could not harm Boré.

=== Education ===
During his tenure as the governor of Azerbaijan, Abbas Mirza sent several students to France, mainly with the goal of improving the military. Mohammad Shah took his father&#x27;s path and sent seven students of noble birth to Europe, among whom were Mirza Hosein Khan Sepahsalar, the future grand vizier of Naser al-Din Shah; and Mirza Malkam Khan, a prominent figure in the Iranian Enlightenment. These students were to master skills in military, painting, medicine, and geometry. Another 10 people were to be sent to France in 1847 but it is uncertain if they were ever sent.

In 1837, on the orders of Mohammad, Mirza Saleh Shirazi published the first Iranian newspaper in Tehran. This newspaper was untitled and was referred to as the &quot;Kaghaz-e Akhbar&quot; (literary news-paper). Many lithographic printing presses were established in Tehran, Urmia, Tabriz and Isfahan on the orders of Mohammad.

=== Administration ===

As a result of various wars and the continual unrest throughout Iran, Mohammad Shah&#x27;s treasury was virtually empty. In the hope of improving financial conditions, he sought to revive barren fields that had been burned during the wars with Russia and the local insurgencies. He asked the French foreign minister for a French irrigation expert but nothing came of it. With Mohammad&#x27;s efforts, however, 1,438 villages—which were part of the royal domain—were made habitable. Mohammad inherited many domain lands from Fath-Ali Shah and Agha Mohammad Khan, and he greatly increased the number of such lands. He confiscated the properties of Aqasi and the properties seized by the Lutis during the Isfahan rebellion, an act which was disliked by major landowners. On his orders, the number of the royal domains were recorded in the &quot;Raqabat-e Mohammadshahi&quot;, which also included all previous inventories.

Most of these domains were given to the villagers and the nomads who wanted settlements. A part of Nader Shah&#x27;s personal domains were returned to the Afshar tribe, who had inherited the claims to these lands once the Afsharid dynasty died out. Despite granting two crores of land per person, many of these lands still belonged to the crown and were under the purposeful maladministration of the contemporary Mostowfi ol-Mamalek (royal treasurer). Mohammad was unable to return more of them and his successor, Naser al-Din Shah, completely ignored the Afshar people&#x27;s pleas and petitions. The same Mostowfi ol-Mamalek secretly extorted money and forced villagers to pay taxes.

Mohammad reinstated governmental positions that had once been part of the Safavid bureaucracy. They bore mixed results; improving the state&#x27;s efficiency but leading to a corrupt administration that reached its peak during Naser al-Din Shah&#x27;s reign. Positions such as the Mostowfi ol-Mamalek became hereditary and many holders of these offices accepted bribes for the lack of a regular salary. Aqasi enlarged governmental titles and promoted his kinsmen, thuz the once-rudimentary bureaucracy of Agha Mohammad Khan became filled with positions with the same duties but under different names.

=== Military ===
Mohammad Shah continued the military reforms his father had started; these included abolishing tribal cavalry and modeling it on Frederick the Great&#x27;s cavalry using Western military technology on a very small scale with Abbas Mirza&#x27;s personal army of 1,000 regular infantry and 500 regular cavalry.

When Mohammad Shah ascended the throne, the Iranian army was disorganized, undisciplined and rigidly hierarchical. Mohammad could hardly muster more than 20,000 men, and they were in poor shape. Instead of carts and wagons, transportation took place on mules, camels and horses. Other than Abbas Mirza&#x27;s cavalry, the army was filled with tribal cavalry who recognized only their tribal chief. To counter these problems, Aqasi put forth a three-staged plan which would centralize the command, create arsenals, and recover from the losses suffered in the wars with Russia. To create arsenals, he established the Tehran foundry, which provided his army with 600 bronze cannons, 200 mortars; and rifles, muskets and Zamburaks.

On Mohammad&#x27;s request, Henry Rawlinson was sent to Kermanshah in April 1835 to train Bahram Mirza&#x27;s troops in the style of the &quot;Nezam-e Jadid&quot;. The Italian F. Colombari reformed the Zamburak units of the Iranian army with the new cannon saddles and falconets he had designed for them.

=== Diplomacy ===
Despite his short reign, Mohammad Shah left a lasting mark on Iran&#x27;s foreign policy. He had resentment towards Russia and Britain, even though both nations had supported him during his accession. The threat of the Russian military bordering Azerbaijan and their navy anchoring in the port of Anzali Lagoon put Mohammad Shah in a state of paranoia at the thought of another war. The Russians argued that per the Treaty of Turkmenchay they were free to anchor their ships in the Caspian Sea but neither Mohammad nor Aqasi considered Anzali part of the sea. To keep the Russian navy away, Mohammad ordered the troops at Anzali to shoot at the Russians if they approached. These events led to Nicholas I exchanging letters with Mohammad. From a diplomatic perspective, Mohammad had allowed the Russian navy to anchor at Anzali as a result of these exchanges. Another source of tension was the Russian merchants in Tabriz and Tehran who owed money to the Iranians but would not pay them in full. In 1843, Mohammad issued a &quot;firman&quot; ordering full payments of the debts by the Russians to prevent fraudulent bankruptcies.

During his reign, various matters disturbed Anglo-Iranian relations, the most troublesome of which was Mohammad&#x27;s campaign to Herat which led to the British, for the first time in their relations with Iran, invading Iran&#x27;s southern islands in the Persian Gulf. In 1841, Mohammad signed a treaty with the British ambassador under which Britain could reopen their consulates in Tehran, Tabriz and Bushehr but had to withdraw from Kharg Island. This treaty was not ideal for either side; the British did not have the right to reside outside the three cities and their goal was to establish a consulate in Gilan near the Russian border. For Mohammad, the treaty was considered shameful and a surrender to his enemy&#x27;s demands. After the signing of the agreement, inexpensive British goods entered Iran through the Tabriz-Trabzon trade zone and filled the country&#x27;s markets, causing the bankruptcy of a number of Iranian businessmen in Tabriz. In 1844, Iranian merchants petitioned Mohammad to prohibit the import of European merchandise. The following year, traders from Kashan implored Mohammad to defend their manufacturers against European merchandise. Both cases were rejected.

Mohammad Shah was an avid Francophile and most excited to build diplomatic relations with France in lieu of Britain and Russia. As a child, Mohammad learned French from Madame de la Marininere, a tutor in the court of Abbas Mirza. He denoted French as the diplomatic language of Iran and ensured diplomats and ambassadors from other nations were fluent in French. In 1839, to resume political relations with France, Mohammad sent Mirza Hossein Khan to Paris, where Hossein Khan was brought before King of France Louis Philippe I. The Iranian delegation took with them numerous gifts to France, including a translation of the Shahnameh and the portrait of Mohammad, which is now kept in the Louvre Museum. On Mohammad&#x27;s insistence, the French embassy in Iran was reopened and France–Iran relations resumed, resulting in Iran sending students to France, a tradition that has continued throughout modern Iranian history.

== Family ==

Mohammad Shah had a large harem, although his harem was smaller than that of other Qajar kings, either due to disliking sex with women or because of his severe illness. By the time he died, he had seven wives, with whom he had sired four sons and five daughters. Of his consorts, a woman named Khadija was Mohammad&#x27;s favourite; they had his best-loved son Abbas Mirza III, who was named after Mohammad&#x27;s father Abbas Mirza and a deceased son of the same name. Mohammad, however, never showed fatherly affection to his son with Malek Jahan Khanom, the future king Naser al-Din. In 1839, Mohammad summoned Naser al-Din to Tehran and treated him coldly. For most of his early childhood, Naser al-Din was no more than a nuisance for Mohammad and his grand vizier.

Of Mohammad Shah&#x27;s seven wives, three of them are known to history:
* Malek Jahan Khanom (26 February 1805 – 2 April 1873); mother of Naser al-Din Shah and Malek Zadeh Khanum.
* Bolour Khanum Zandieh, the granddaughter of Karim Khan Zand. Mother of two daughters.
* Khadija, daughter of a Naqshbandi chief. Mother of Abbas Mirza III.

He had four sons:
* Naser al-Din Shah (16 July 1831 – 1 May 1896); Shah of Iran (r. 1848 – 1896)
* Abbas Mirza II, died in childhood.
* Abbas Mirza III (November 27, 1839 – April 13, 1897); known as Mulk Ara.
* Mohammad Taqi Mirza (d. 1901); known as Rokn ed-Dowleh, governor of several provinces.
* Abdol-samad Mirza (May 1843 – 21 October 1929); known as Ezz ed-Dowleh.

He had five daughters, four of whom are known:
* Malek Zadeh Khanum, (1834-35 – 27 June 1905); known as Ezzat ed-Dowleh, married five times, and was the grandmother of Mohammad Ali Shah.
* Ozra, daughter of Bolour Khanum Zandieh.
* Effat al-Dowleh, daughter of Bolour Khanum Zandieh.
* Aziz ol-Dowleh, married Fath-Ali Khan Saheb Divan.

== Historiography and personality ==

Mohammad Shah&#x27;s 14-year reign resembles an interregnum between the reigns of Fath-Ali Shah and Naser al-Din Shah. During his reign, the &quot;ulama&quot; possessed little influence over the crown. Mohammad was heavily influenced by Sufi theology as a result of his close friendship with and reliance on Aqasi. His corresponding negligence of his relations with the Shi&#x27;ia &quot;ulama&quot; was the most lasting aspect of his reign. Mohammad had a passive character, was withdrawn from everyday life, and most of the time was physically unwell; he relied on Aqasi to govern while taking a ceremonial role himself. The extent of Aqasi&#x27;s influence over Mohammad increased in Mohammad&#x27;s last years, when he became very dependent on his grand vizier; Aqasi, however, proved to be a poor ruler, and mismanaged the economy and military. Mohammed&#x27;s reign saw costly wars and maladministration, and by the end of it Iran suffered from instability, turmoil, and chaos.

Most historians present Mohammad as sedentary and aloof from governmental matters, an image that is accurate when applied to his later years. In his youth, though, Mohammad was an active soldier like his father and his grandfather. He was more Europeanised than his ancestors; Mohammad&#x27;s dress contrasted the more traditional appearance of Fath-Ali Shah, who wore Persian ornamented long robes, high heels and a long beard. Mohammed wore semi-Europeanised dress and maintained a short beard. Travel writer James Baillie Fraser, who met Mohammad in 1834, described him as &quot;the worthiest of all the numerous descendants of Fath-Ali Shah, particularly in the points of moral and private character&quot;. Mohammad was the last Qajar shah to lead his army into war. He was praised for his bravery; the contemporaneous historian Mohammad Taqi Sepehr wrote: &quot;Until now, in Shiʿite realms, I never heard about a sovereign endowed with such a pure nature and so perfect manners and natural perfection. Bravery and firmness perfectly appeared in his demeanours.&quot; Still, most contemporary historians were unimpressed with his rulership and character. Some British writers accused him of being a Russian pawn for his instigation of the First Herat War.

== Coinage and titles ==
On his seal is the text &quot;al-Sultan ibn al-Sultan Mohammad Shah Ghazi&quot; and on a portrait that was painted between 1836 and 1837, he is identified as &quot;al-Sultan b. al-Sultan b. al-Sultan b. al-Sultan&quot;, an effort to legitimate his right of rule by remarking on his lineage. Mohammad used the titles &quot;Khaqan son of Khaqan&quot;, a Turko-Mongol title; and Shahanshah, an ancient Iranian title, to follow the styles of Fath-Ali Shah, who had used both Khaqan and Shahanshah.

His coins bear the inscription &quot;Mohammad, Shahanshah-i Anbiya&quot; (Mohammad, King of the Prophets). Mohammad Shah&#x27;s coins display artistic aestheticism that is different to the coins of Fath-Ali and Naser al-Din, both of them had displayed a love for glitter.

<doc id="854218" wikidata="Q107321" url="?curid=854218" title="BAP (German band)">
<text>BAP () is a German rock band. With thirteen albums reaching the number one in the German record charts, BAP is one of the most successful rock acts in their home country.

Nearly all of BAP&#x27;s lyrics are written in &quot;Kölsch&quot;, the dialect of Cologne, or more precisely in a Kölsch-influenced derivation of Eifelplatt, a regional variant of the Ripuarian language spoken in the nearby rural Eifel. Niedecken&#x27;s most prominent musical influences, especially early in his career, were Bob Dylan, the Kinks, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and Wolfgang Ambros.

== History ==

The group was founded in 1976 under the name &quot; in Cologne by Wolfgang Niedecken and Hans Heres. In 1981, they released their most famous song &quot; (&quot;Damn long time ago&quot;), in which Niedecken describes regrets he has about his relationship with his then recently deceased father. The band&#x27;s name &quot;BAP&quot; derived from &quot;BAPP&quot;, both, a play-on-words on the &quot;Kölsch&quot; word &quot;&quot; (related to the German word &quot;dad&quot;), but pronounced differently, and Niedecken&#x27;s then-nickname.

Niedecken translated a collection of Bob Dylan&#x27;s lyrics to German for his 1995 solo album &quot;Leopardefell&quot;.

<text>David Teniers the Elder (158229 July 1649), Flemish painter, was born at Antwerp of a family originally from Ath.

==Biography==

The Teniers family of painters came from Ath, a town in Hainaut. 

Having received his first training in the painter&#x27;s art from his brother Juliaen, he studied under Rubens in Antwerp, and subsequently under Elsheimer in Rome; he became a member of the Antwerp guild of painters in 1606.

Though his ambition led him at times to try his skill in large religious, historical and mythological compositions, his claim to fame depends chiefly on his landscapes and paintings of peasants carousing, of kermesse scenes and the like, which are marked by a healthy sense of humour, and which are not infrequently confused with the early works of his son David.

There is a large painting by the elder Teniers at St. Paul&#x27;s church in Antwerp, representing the &quot;Works of Charity&quot;. At the Vienna Gallery are four landscapes painted by Teniers under the influence of Elsheimer, and four small mythological subjects, among them &quot;Vertumnus and Pomona&quot;, and &quot;Juno, Jupiter and Io&quot;. The National Gallery has a characteristic scene of village life, &quot;Playing at Bowls&quot;, a &quot;Conversation of three men and a woman&quot;, and a large &quot;Rocky Landscape&quot;. Other examples of his work are to be found at the galleries of St Petersburg, Madrid, Brussels, Munich, Dresden and Berlin (&quot;The Temptation of St Anthony&quot;).

Teniers also achieved success as a picture dealer, and is known to have attended the fair of St Germain in Paris in 1635, with a large number of paintings by himself and by his four sons. He died at Antwerp in 1649.

<doc id="854248" wikidata="Q1459157" url="?curid=854248" title="RFB (protocol)">
<text>RFB (&quot;remote framebuffer&quot;) is an open simple protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces. Because it works at the framebuffer level it is applicable to all windowing systems and applications, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, the X Window System and Wayland. RFB is the protocol used in Virtual Network Computing (VNC) and its derivatives.

==Description==
By default, a viewer/client uses TCP port 5900 to connect to a server (or 5800 for browser access), but can also be set to use any other port. Alternatively, a server can connect to a viewer in &quot;listening mode&quot; (by default on port 5500). One advantage of listening mode is that the server site does not have to configure its firewall/NAT to allow access on the specified ports; the burden is on the viewer, which is useful if the server site has no computer expertise, while the viewer user would be expected to be more knowledgeable.

Although RFB started as a relatively simple protocol, it has been enhanced with additional features (such as file transfers) and more sophisticated compression and security techniques as it has developed. To maintain seamless cross-compatibility between the many different VNC client and server implementations, the clients and servers negotiate a connection using the best RFB version, and the most appropriate compression and security options that they can both support.

==History==
RFB was originally developed at Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) as a remote display technology to be used by a simple thin client with Asynchronous Transfer Mode connectivity called a Videotile. In order to keep the device as simple as possible, RFB was developed and used in preference to any of the existing remote display technologies.

RFB found a second and more enduring use when VNC was developed. VNC was released as open source software and the RFB specification published on the web. Since then RFB has been a free protocol which anybody can use.

When ORL was closed in 2002 some of the key people behind VNC and RFB formed RealVNC, Ltd., in order to continue development of VNC and to maintain the RFB protocol. The current RFB protocol is published on the RealVNC website.

== Versions ==

Published versions of the RFB protocol are as follows:

Developers are free to add additional encoding and security types but they must book unique identification numbers for these with the maintainers of the protocol so that the numbers do not clash. Clashing type numbers would cause confusion when handshaking a connection and break cross-compatibility between implementations. The list of encoding and security types was maintained by RealVNC Ltd and is separate from the protocol specification so that new types can be added without requiring the specification to be reissued. Since December 2012, the list went to IANA.

A community version of the RFB protocol specification which aims to document all existing extensions is hosted by the TigerVNC project.

== Encoding types ==

Multiple encodings are part of the negotiation. Some of the encodings are pseudo-encodings used to advertise the ability to handle a certain extension. Encodings include:

* Raw
* Zlib
* Tight
* XZ
* H.264
* Tight PNG

Of the publicly-defined picture-based encodings, the most efficient ones are the Tight encoding types. Two types of encodings are defined by TightVNC: Tight Encoding (a mixture of rectangle, palette and gradient filling with zlib and JPEG, plus a Zlib-plus-filter &quot;basic compression&quot;) and Tight PNG Encoding (Tight encoding with basic compression replaced with PNG data).

H.264 has been researched for encoding RFB data, but the preliminary results (using Open H.264 format) were described as lackluster by a TurboVNC developer. It does become more efficient with fewer I-frames (keyframes), but CPU utilization remains a problem.

==Limitations==
In terms of transferring clipboard data, &quot;there is currently no way to transfer text outside the Latin-1 character set&quot;. A common pseudo-encoding extension solves the problem by using UTF-8 in an extended format.

The VNC protocol is pixel based. Although this leads to great flexibility (i.e. any type of desktop can be displayed), it is often less efficient than solutions that have a better understanding of the underlying graphic layout like X11 or desktop such as RDP. Those protocols send graphic primitives or high level commands in a simpler form (e.g. open window), whereas RFB just sends the raw pixel data, albeit compressed.

The VNC protocol expresses mouse button state in a single byte, as binary up/down. This limits the number of mouse buttons to eight (effectively 7 given convention of button 0 meaning &quot;disabled&quot;). Many modern mice enumerate 9 or more buttons, leading to forward/back buttons having no effect over RFB. A &quot;GII&quot; extension solves this problem.

There is no standard to transfer sound data at all, with the sole exception that the server may signal a bell (audible beep, notification sound) should be played by the client.

<text>Traprain Law is a hill east of Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. It is the site of a hill fort or possibly &quot;oppidum&quot;, which covered at its maximum extent about . It is the site of the Traprain Law Treasure, the largest Roman silver hoard from anywhere outside the Roman Empire which included exquisite silver artefacts.

The hill, about above MSL, was already a place of burial by around 1500 BC, and showed evidence of occupation and signs of ramparts after 1000 BC. The ramparts were rebuilt and realigned many times in the following centuries. Excavations have shown it was occupied in the Late Iron Age from about AD 40 until the last quarter of the 2nd century (about the time that the Antonine Wall was manned).

In the 1st century AD the Romans recorded the Votadini as a British tribe in the area, and Traprain Law is generally thought to have been one of their major settlements, named &quot;Curia&quot; by Ptolemy. They emerged as a kingdom under the Brythonic version of their name Gododdin and Traprain Law is thought to have been their capital before moving to Din Eidyn (Castle Rock in modern Edinburgh).

In 1938 an area of the hill was leased to the district council for use as a quarry for road stone, causing substantial disfigurement to the landscape.

==Name history==

This hill was only known as Traprain Law from the late 18th century, taking its name from a local hamlet. This is etymologically a Cumbric name cognate with Welsh &quot;tref&quot; &#x27;farm&#x27; and either &quot;pren&quot; &#x27;tree&#x27; or &quot;bryn&quot; &#x27;hill&#x27;. Law comes from the Old English word &quot;hlāw&quot;, meaning a hill.

Before that, it is found on old maps as Dunpendyrlaw. This name appears on a map printed in 1630. An alternative spelling &#x27;Dounprenderlaw&#x27; was used in 1547, when a signal beacon was placed on the hill to warn of an English invasion.

Locally, and particularly amongst fishermen who use it as a landmark, it is still referred to as Dunpelder. This name seems also to be etymologically Cumbric, cognate with Welsh &quot;din&quot; &#x27;fort&#x27; and &quot;pelydr&quot; &#x27;spear shafts&#x27;, thus meaning &#x27;fort of the spear shafts&#x27;. Dun may also be derived from the Scottish Gaelic word &quot;dùn&quot; meaning &#x27;fort&#x27;. It is as &#x27;Dunpeldyr&#x27;, the capital of King Lot of Lothian, that Traprain Law appears in Mary Stewart&#x27;s Merlin Trilogy.

==Archaeology==
A team led by Curle and Cree began the first excavations in 1914 and continued them until 1923, finding layers of fragmentary stone and timber houses under the turf.

===Traprain Law Treasure===

In 1919, Alexander Ormiston Curle recovered a hoard of silver plate. The hoard is known as the Traprain Treasure, or Traprain Law Treasure. Consisting of over of sliced-up Roman-era silver, the discovery was made in a pit within the boundary of the settlement earlier uncovered. Four Gallic coins were discovered with the hoard; one of the emperor Valens (reigned 364–378), three of Arcadius (reigned 383–408) and one of Honorius (reigned 393–423), which dates the find to some point in the fifth century AD after the Romans had left Britain. The quality of some of the items suggests that they may have come from as far afield as Rome, Ravenna, or possibly Antioch or Constantinople.

Most objects had been crushed and hacked to pieces, and only some were left intact. A great deal of the find was table silver, but there were also early Christian items and remnants from a Roman officer&#x27;s uniform.

It had originally been thought that the objects had been brought back from a raid abroad, as the objects had been split up ready for division. Later finds such as the Mildenhall Treasure found at Mildenhall, Suffolk and the Hoxne Hoard from Suffolk, showed that silverware of this nature was certainly in use in Roman Britain. A further suggestion is that it had been brought back on a raid by the Votadini across Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the silver was in payment for mercenary service to protect weaker tribes from the inroads of the Scots, Picts, and Angles, the silver being split up as bullion due to lack of adequate coinage.

Further excavations were made in 1939 by Cruden and in 1947 by Bersu.

The collection was restored where appropriate and sent to the National Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh and now is in the care of the National Museum of Scotland.

==Folklore==
In legend, Traprain Law was the cliff from which Thenaw, the mother of Saint Mungo, was thrown when her father, King Lot or Leudonus, discovered she was pregnant by Owain mab Urien. Saved by divine providence, she was transported by boat to Saint Serf&#x27;s community in Culross, where she gave birth to Kentigern, later also known as Mungo.

==Geodesy==
Up to 1891 Traprain Law was the origin (meridian) of the 6-inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of East Lothian. After that year the East Lothian maps were drawn according to the meridian of The Buck in Aberdeenshire.

==Geology==
Traprain Law, together with nearby Berwick Law and Bass Rock, is an example of the unusual rock type Phonolite. It was intruded around 350 million years ago as a laccolith into sandstones, siltstones and dolomitic limestones of the Ballagan Formation of the Carboniferous period. During quarrying, large xenoliths of sandstone and shale have been found and recorded in detail. 
Detailed optical and chemical analysis have revealed the presence of small quantities of Sodalite, Olivine and Apatite.

<text>The Great Western Tiers (Palawa kani: &quot;Kooparoona Niara&quot;) are a collection of mountain bluffs that form the northern edge of the Central Highlands plateau in Tasmania, Australia. The bluffs are contained within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Site.

The bluffs stretch northwest to southeast over from the Western Bluff near the town of Mole Creek to the Millers Bluff, approximately west of Campbell Town. During the late 19th century the Tiers were known as the Great Western Range.

==Features==
The Central Highlands, or Tasmanian central plateau, was uplifted from the lower Meander Valley, most probably in the Eocene epoch though possibly earlier, forming the Tiers&#x27; escarpment. The plateau&#x27;s north-east boundary, which ranges from –, originated in extensive Tertiary faulting.

This escarpment divides the high, rocky, sparsely inhabited central plateau from the fertile lower land of the Meander Valley and the northern midlands. The edge of the tiers have prominent cliffs and columns of Jurassic dolerite. The highest peak in the tiers is the Ironstone Mountain. Unlike most of the bluffs this mountain is not visible from the Meander Valley, but is south of the escarpment. The escarpment has a distinct concave profile. Cliffs and scree slopes are common features. The dolerite is so prominent as the older rocks that overlay them are softer and have been eroded away. In places dolerite columns have collapsed into scree slopes.

The face of the tiers has been eroded and retreated approximately since their formation, leaving the mountain Quamby Bluff as a solitary outlier. The central plateau&#x27;s landform has been changed by glaciation. Valleys under the tiers are filled with talus, mostly bounders with a 25% mix of soil formed from boulder weathering.

== Peaks ==
The peaks and bluffs of the Great Western Tiers include:
* Brady&#x27;s lookout, at . Named after the bushranger Matthew Brady.
* Billop Bluff
* Dry&#x27;s Bluff at . Origin of the Liffey River.
* Ironstone Mountain, at 
* Millers Bluff, at 
* Mother Cummings Peak, at 
* Mount Blackwood
* Mount Parmeener
* Neals Bluff
* Panorama Hill
* Projection Bluff
* Quamby Bluff, at

<doc id="854267" wikidata="Q367741" url="?curid=854267" title="Adriaen van de Velde">
<text>Adriaen van de Velde (bapt. 30 November 1636, in Amsterdam – bur. 21 January 1672, in Amsterdam), was a Dutch painter, draughtsman and print artist. His favorite subjects were landscapes with animals and genre scenes. He also painted beaches, dunes, forests, winter scenes, portraits in landscapes, as well as mythological and biblical scenes. He belongs to a group of painters referred to as the Dutch Italianate painters, who combined Dutch agricultural landscapes with mythological or Arcadian scenes in Italian settings. His paintings are characterised by their delicate, careful composition and his mastery of lighting effects as well as the human figure.

==Life==
Adriaen was born in Amsterdam where he was baptised in the Oude Kerk on 30 November 1636. He was the son of the marine painter Willem van de Velde the Elder and Judith Adriaens van Leeuwen. His brother Willem van de Velde the Younger was also a marine painter.
He initially studied with his father. Not wishing to follow in the family tradition of marine painting, he decided to move to Haarlem to continue his study in the workshop of Jan Wynants, a landscape painter. In Haarlem he also met Philip Wouwerman and Paulus Potter, both animal painters who had an important influence on his work. 
From 1657 he worked in Amsterdam where he married on 5 April 1657 Maria Pieters Oudekerck (or Ouderkerk), a Catholic. He converted to Catholicism even though its adherents suffered persecution and could only practise their faith in clandestine churches. All five of his children were baptized in such churches around Amsterdam. His daughter married the broker Sodyn in Amsterdam. She was the source for the Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken&#x27;s biographical sketch of her father. Van de Velde&#x27;s career blossomed and he became one of the foremost landscape artists in the Dutch Republic.

He collaborated with other artists in Amsterdam typically adding the staffage or animals to their paintings. These artists included his master Wynants, Meindert Hobbema, Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael, Adriaen Hendriksz Verboom, Philips Koninck, Jan van der Heyden and Frederik de Moucheron.

Despite his success as an artist, he was in dire straits throughout his life. His wife had to run a linen business to help make ends meet. When he died his possessions and works were auctioned off but the proceeds were insufficient to cover his debts.

His pupils included Johannes Innevelt, Johannes van der Bent, Dirck van Bergen and Jacob Coning.

==Work==

Despite his short career, van de Velde created an extensive body of work of paintings, drawings and prints. His favorite subjects were meadows and Italianate views with herdsmen and cattle. He also painted beaches, dunes, forests, winter scenes, portraits in landscapes, as well as mythological and biblical scenes. Although primarily a painter of summer landscapes, he also depicted winter scenes and beaches. His early work with its tight, precise technique and hard, cool sunlight shows the influence of Paulus Potter. His mature style reveals the influence of Dutch Italianate painters such as Karel Dujardin, Nicolaes Berchem and Jan Asselijn. This is reflected in his handling of the soft sunlight and warm hues in his depictions of the Italian landscape.

He prepared his paintings meticulously by making preparatory drawings, many of which have been preserved. These drawings include sketches of landscapes, cattle in meadows and life figure studies. The many nude studies executed in red or black chalk are highlights of his oeuvre. He reused these studies in different compositions.

He also was active as an etcher. His earliest known works are a set of six etchings executed in 1653. His twenty-odd etchings depict mostly cattle in landscapes, occasionally with herders. These works were highly prized by collectors in his time.

<text>Jules Arnous de Rivière (4 May 1830, Nantes – 11 September 1905, Paris) was the strongest French chess player from the late 1850s through the late 1870s. He is best known today for playing many games with Paul Morphy when the American champion visited Paris in 1858 and 1863.

Born in Nantes to a French father William Henri Arnous-Rivière and an Irish mother Marie Tobin. His grandfather baron Jean-Joseph Arnous-Rivière from an old breton family of Nantes have been ennobled by king Charles X in 1828. 

Arnous-Rivière finished 6th of 13 in the 1867 Paris international tournament organized in conjunction with the Exposition Universelle. Although he finished well below the strongest foreign masters, he was ahead of fellow Parisian, Polish-born, Samuel Rosenthal. Arnous-Rivière had success in some minor tournaments in Paris: 3rd in 1880, 2nd= in 1881, 2nd in 1882–3, and 3rd in the Café de la Régence tournament of 1896.

Arnous-Rivière fared poorly in his casual games against Morphy, but did well in more formal match play. He lost to Serafino Dubois (+8-21=3) in 1855, and Gustav Neumann (+3-7=2) in 1864, but he drew with Ignatz von Kolisch (5:5) in 1859, and defeated Thomas Wilson Barnes in London (+5−2=0) and Paul Journoud in Paris (+7−2=1) in 1860, and Johann Löwenthal (+2−0=0) in Paris in 1867. He also lost a close match to Mikhail Chigorin by +4−5=1 in 1883.

Arnous-Rivière&#x27;s writings included several chess columns and books on billiards and roulette. He also invented many games.

He married 27 October 1858 to Joséphine de Coulhac Mazérieux (1834–1921) and had three children: William Arnous-Rivière (1860–1904), Hélène Arnous-Rivière (1862–?) and Jacques Arnous-Rivière (1874–1919). Hélène Arnous-Rivière married Baron Christian-Hubert von Pfeffel; her great-grandson is British politician Stanley Johnson, father of Boris Johnson.

Arnous-Rivière died in Paris in 1905.

<doc id="854269" wikidata="Q2472277" url="?curid=854269" title="USS Intrepid (1798)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Intrepid&quot; was a captured ketch rigged galiot in the United States Navy during the First Barbary War.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; was built in France in 1798 for Napoleon&#x27;s Egyptian expedition. The vessel was sold to Tripoli, which she served as &quot;Mastico&quot; (referred to as &quot;Martigana&quot; in one document). The bomb ketch was one of several Tripolitan vessels which captured on 31 October 1803 after the American frigate had run fast aground on uncharted Kaliusa reef some five miles (8 km) east of Tripoli.

==Capture==
, a schooner with Lt. Stephen Decatur in command, captured &quot;Mastico&quot; on 23 December 1803 as it was sailing from Tripoli to Constantinople under Turkish colors and without passports. After a time-consuming search for a translator, the ketch&#x27;s papers and the testimony of an English ship master who had been in Tripoli to witness her role in operations against &quot;Philadelphia&quot; convinced the commander of the American squadron, Commodore Edward Preble, that &quot;Mastico&quot; was a legitimate prize. He took her into the U.S. Navy and renamed her &quot;Intrepid&quot;.

==Destruction of USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;==

Meanwhile, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; lay in Tripoli Harbor threatening to become Tripoli&#x27;s largest and most powerful corsair. Preble decided that he must destroy the frigate before the enemy could fit her out for action against his squadron. In order to take the Tripolitans by surprise, he assigned the task to the only ship which could be sure of passing as a North African vessel, &quot;Intrepid&quot;. He appointed Lieutenant Stephen Decatur captain of the ketch on 31 January 1804 and ordered him to prepare her for a month&#x27;s cruise to Tripoli in company with . Preble&#x27;s orders directed Decatur to slip into harbor at night, to board and burn the frigate, and make good his retreat in &quot;Intrepid&quot;, unless it then seemed feasible to use her as a fire ship against other shipping in the harbor. In the latter case, he was to escape in boats to &quot;Syren&quot; which would await just outside the harbor.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Syren&quot; set sail 2 February and arrived off Tripoli five days later. However, bad weather delayed the operation until 16 February. That evening &quot;Syren&quot; took station outside the harbor and launched her boats to stand by for rescue work. At 7 o&#x27;clock &quot;Intrepid&quot; entered the harbor and 2½ hours later was alongside &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. When hailed, they claimed to be traders who had lost their anchor in the late gale, and begged permission to make fast to the frigate till morning. Guards suddenly noticed the ketch still had her anchors and gave the alarm. Leaving a small force commanded by Surgeon Lewis Heermann on board &quot;Intrepid&quot;, Decatur led 60 of his men to the deck of the frigate. A brief struggle, conducted without firing a gun, gave the Americans control of the vessel enabling them to set her ablaze. Decatur, the last man to leave the burning frigate, remained on board &quot;Philadelphia&quot; until flames blazed from the hatchways and ports of her spar deck. When he finally left the ship, her rigging and tops were afire. Shore batteries opened up on &quot;Intrepid&quot; as she escaped only to be answered from abandoned &quot;Philadelphia&quot; when her guns discharged by the heat of the conflagration.

When Lord Nelson, then blockading Toulon, heard of &quot;Intrepid&quot; feat, he is said to have called it &quot;the most bold and daring act of the age&quot;.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; returned to Syracuse on 19 February, and the next day her crew returned to their original ships. The ketch was decommissioned and remained in Syracuse with only a midshipman and 3 or 4 men on board as noted on 22 February in USS Constitution&#x27;s logbook. She became a hospital ship on 1 June and continued this duty through July. She departed Syracuse on 12 August for Malta, where she took on board fresh supplies for the squadron and departed on 17 August. She rejoined the squadron off Tripoli on 22 August.

==Fire ship==

A week later she began to be fitted out as a &quot;floating volcano&quot; and was to be sent into the harbor and blown up in the midst of the corsair fleet close under the walls of Tripoli. The vessel was loaded with 100 barrels of powder and 150 fixed shells, the fuses leading to the explosives were calculated to burn for 15 minutes. Carpenters of every ship were pressed into service and she was ready on 1 September, but unfavorable weather delayed the operation until 4 September. That day, Lieutenant Richard Somers assumed command of the fire ship. Volunteers for the mission also included Midshipman Henry Wadsworth and ten seamen. Shortly after &quot;Intrepid&quot; got underway, Midshipman Joseph Israel arrived with last-minute orders from Commodore Preble and insisted on accompanying the expedition.

Two of the fastest rowing vessels were chosen to assist in the mission and return the volunteers from the mission. At eight o&#x27;clock on 4 September &quot;Intrepid&quot; got underway with &quot;Argus, Vixen&quot;, and &quot;Nautilus&quot; serving as escorts up to the point by the rocks near the harbor&#x27;s entrance, remaining there to watch and pick up the returning rowing boats and return the crew from their mission. As &quot;Intrepid&quot; approached the enemy fleet they were discovered and fired upon by carronades from the overlooking shore batteries. At 8:30 before &quot;Intrepid&quot; could get to its final position it exploded, lighting up the entire scene and sending the hull, yards and rigging and exploding shells in all directions, killing all on board. The anxious crews of the awaiting squadron were shaken by the concussion of the great explosion but at this time could not determine the exact fate of the mission. They remained there the entire night with the hope that the rowing vessels would return with the volunteers, but by morning their hopes turned to despair when the light of day finally revealed what had happened. Commodore Preble later concluded that an attempt was made by intercepting boarding vessels, and that Somers decided to destroy the vessel, himself, and his crew to avoid capture and enslavement, but there was no way of knowing the exact events which resulted in the explosion.

==Aftermath==
The remains of the 13 sailors on the ship washed ashore the next day after the explosion and were dragged through the street by angry locals. The bodies were buried in an unmarked mass grave outside Tripoli. In 1949, the Libyan government unearthed the remains and moved them to the current cemetery. Rear Admiral Richard H. Cruzen, veteran of two expeditions to Antarctica, represented the U.S. Navy at the ceremony unveiling the monument to the fallen sailors on 2 April 1949. Since then, the Libyan government has maintained the grave site, although sometimes has allowed maintenance of the site to deteriorate. On 17 December 2011, US defense chief Leon Panetta visited the cemetery in Tripoli and placed a wreath at the grave site. The US has no plans to repatriate the remains to the US.

<doc id="854272" wikidata="Q409458" url="?curid=854272" title="Creatine kinase">
<text>Creatine kinase (CK), also known as creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or phosphocreatine kinase, is an enzyme () expressed by various tissues and cell types. CK catalyses the conversion of creatine and uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to create phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This CK enzyme reaction is reversible and thus ATP can be generated from PCr and ADP.

In tissues and cells that consume ATP rapidly, especially skeletal muscle, but also brain, photoreceptor cells of the retina, hair cells of the inner ear, spermatozoa and smooth muscle, PCr serves as an energy reservoir for the rapid buffering and regeneration of ATP &quot;in situ&quot;, as well as for intracellular energy transport by the PCr shuttle or circuit. Thus creatine kinase is an important enzyme in such tissues.

Clinically, creatine kinase is assayed in blood tests as a marker of damage of CK-rich tissue such as in myocardial infarction (heart attack), rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown), muscular dystrophy, autoimmune myositides, and acute kidney injury.

==Types==
In the cells, the cytosolic CK enzymes consist of two subunits, which can be either &quot;B&quot; (brain type) or &quot;M&quot; (muscle type). There are, therefore, three different isoenzymes: CK-MM, CK-BB and CK-MB. The genes for these subunits are located on different chromosomes: &quot;B&quot; on 14q32 and &quot;M&quot; on 19q13. In addition to those three &quot;cytosolic&quot; CK isoforms, there are two mitochondrial creatine kinase isoenzymes, the &quot;ubiquitous&quot; form and the &quot;sarcomeric&quot; form. The functional entity of the mitochondrial CK isoforms is an octamer consisting of four dimers each.

While mitochondrial creatine kinase is directly involved in the formation of phosphocreatine from mitochondrial ATP, cytosolic CK regenerates ATP from ADP, using PCr. This happens at intracellular sites where ATP is used in the cell, with CK acting as an &quot;in situ&quot; ATP regenerator.
Isoenzyme patterns differ in tissues. Skeletal muscle expresses CK-MM (98%) and low levels of CK-MB (1%). The myocardium (heart muscle), in contrast, expresses CK-MM at 70% and CK-MB at 25–30%. CK-BB is predominantly expressed in brain and smooth muscle, including vascular and uterine tissue.

==Protein structure==

The first structure of a creatine kinase solved by X-ray protein crystallography was that of the octameric, sarcomeric muscle-type mitochondrial CK (s-mtCK) in 1996., followed by the structure of ubiquitous mitochondrial CK (u-mtCK) in 2000.
The atomic structure of the banana-shaped, dimeric cytosolic brain-type BB-CK was solved in 1999 at a resolution of 1,4 Å. Cytosolic BB-CK, as well as muscle-type MM-CK both form banana-shaped symmetric dimers, with one catalytic active site in each subunit.

==Functions==
Mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKm) is present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it regenerates phosphocreatine (PCr) from mitochondrially generated ATP and creatine (Cr) imported from the cytosol. Apart from the two mitochondrial CK isoenzyme forms, that is, ubiquitous mtCK (present in non-muscle tissues) and sarcomeric mtCK (present in sarcomeric muscle), there are three cytosolic CK isoforms present in the cytosol, depending on the tissue. Whereas MM-CK is expressed in sarcomeric muscle, that is, skeletal and cardiac muscle, MB-CK is expressed in cardiac muscle, and BB-CK is expressed in smooth muscle and in most non-muscle tissues.

Mitochondrial mtCK and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit. PCr generated by mtCK in mitochondria is shuttled to cytosolic CK that is coupled to ATP-dependent processes, e.g. ATPases, such as acto-myosin ATPase and calcium ATPase involved in muscle contraction, and sodium/potassium ATPase involved in sodium retention in the kidney. The bound cytosolic CK accepts the PCr shuttled through the cell and uses ADP to regenerate ATP, which can then be used as an energy source by the ATPases (CK is associated intimately with the ATPases, forming a functionally coupled microcompartment). PCr is not only an energy buffer, but also a cellular transport form of energy between subcellular sites of energy (ATP) production (mitochondria and glycolysis) and those of energy utilization (ATPases).

Thus, CK enhances skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle contractility, and is involved in the generation of blood pressure. Further, the ADP-scavenging action of creatine kinase has been implicated in bleeding disorders: persons with highly elevated plasma CK could be prone to major bleeding.

==Laboratory testing==
CK is often determined routinely in a medical laboratory. It used to be determined specifically in patients with chest pain to recognize acute myocardial infarction, but this test has been largely replaced by troponin. Normal values at rest are usually between 60 and 400 IU/L, where one unit is enzyme activity, more specifically the amount of enzyme that will catalyze 1 μmol of substrate per minute under specified conditions (temperature, pH, substrate concentrations and activators.) This test is not specific for the &quot;type&quot; of CK that is elevated.

Creatine kinase in the blood may be high in health and disease. Exercise increases the outflow of creatine kinase to the blood stream for up to a week, and this is the most common cause of high CK in blood. Furthermore, high CK in the blood may be related to high intracellular CK such as in persons of African descent.

Finally, high CK in the blood may be an indication of damage to CK-rich tissue, such as in rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction, myositis and myocarditis. This means creatine kinase in blood may be elevated in a wide range of clinical conditions including the use of medication such as statins; endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism; and skeletal muscle diseases and disorders including malignant hyperthermia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Furthermore, the isoenzyme determination has in the past been used extensively as an indication for myocardial damage in heart attacks. Troponin measurement has largely replaced this in many hospitals, although some centers still rely on CK-MB.


== Nomenclature ==
This enzyme is often listed in medical literature under incorrect name &quot;creatinine kinase&quot;. Creatinine is not a substrate or a product of the enzyme.

<doc id="854274" wikidata="Q454671" url="?curid=854274" title="Philips Wouwerman">
<text>Philips Wouwerman (also Wouwermans) (24 May 1619 (baptized) – 19 May 1668) was a Dutch painter of hunting, landscape and battle scenes. He became prolific during the Dutch Golden Age and joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.

==Life and work==
Philips Wouwerman was one of the most versatile and prolific artists of the Dutch Golden Age. Embedded in the artistic environment and tradition of his home town of Haarlem, Wouwerman made an important and highly influential contribution to the canon of seventeenth-century Dutch painting. His pictures were in demand during his lifetime, and even more sought after in the 18th century. Throughout Europe, formerly princely art collections like in Dresden and St. Petersburg still bear witness to this widespread admiration of Wouwerman&#x27;s art.
Born in Haarlem in 1619, the son of a now altogether obscure painter named Pouwels Joostsz Wouwerman, little is known of his artistic schooling. According to Cornelis de Bie, he studied with Frans Hals (1581/85–1666), but the particular style of Hals didn&#x27;t leave a footmark on his oeuvre. Apart from a short stay in Hamburg at the end of the 1630s, Wouwerman seemed to have lived in Haarlem during his whole artistic career and died as a prosperous member of the community at the age of 48. He joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1640 and here took on several official posts in the years to come. Wouwerman also worked as an estate agent in his home town, as many documents in Haarlem archives mentioned the artist in this context.

Wouwerman started his artistic career with simple depictions of everyday life in the tradition of the &quot;bamboccianti&quot; by Pieter van Laer (1592/99–after 1642). His paintings of the mid-1640s often feature a diagonal slope of land, a tree which functions as a repoussoir, and figures accompanied by horses. Over the next thirty years he developed an individual style, treating a wide range of subjects from genre and landscape to military and religious scenes (equestrian scenes, hunting and hawking parties, landscapes with travellers, cavalry battles and military encampments, peasants festivities etc.). He is noted for his skill in the depiction of horses of all breeds seen in motion. The art historian Frederik J. Duparc calls Wouwerman &quot;undoubtedly the most accomplished and successful 17th-century Dutch painter of horses&quot;. The masterpieces from his best period (around 1650–1660) are of indisputably high quality, beautifully combining imaginary southern landscapes and a typically Dutch atmosphere. Wouwerman&#x27;s paintings are characterized by subdued colours, a cool atmosphere and a wealth of witty, anecdotal details. He died in Haarlem.

The first retrospective exhibition of Philips Wouwerman&#x27;s work took place in Kassel, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, and in The Hague, The Royal Picture Gallers Mauritshuis, 2009/2010.

==Family==
At an early age, Wouwerman married Anna Pietersz. van Broeckhoff with whom he had ten children. They lived on the Bakenessergracht in a house that was also lived in by Haarlem painters Cornelis Gerritsz Decker and Hendrik de Meijer. Seven of the Wouwerman children survived and, after the death of their mother in 1670, accepted a substantial inheritance.

==Output==
About 800 pictures were listed in John Smith&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue raisonné&quot; (1829/1842) as the work of Philip Wouwerman. In Hofstede de Groot&#x27;s enlarged &quot;Catalogue&quot; (1908) the number exceeds to 1200. In Birgit Schumacher&#x27;s recently published &quot;Catalogue raisonné&quot; (2006), only about 570 pictures were listed as authentic works, as many of the pictures mentioned by Hofstede de Groot were actually painted by countless followers and imitators all over Europe. Jan and Pieter Wouwerman, the younger brothers of Philips, were often regarded as close followers whose pictures seemed to have been frequently attributed to Philips. 
The oeuvre of Pieter (1623–1682) clearly manifests the influence of Philips with regard to the range of subjects, but regarding the artistic style, Pieter had quite one of his own. And Jan (1629–1666) was a rather autonomous landscape painter. Out of the countless followers, some of the most gifted artists working in Wouwerman&#x27;s style are worth mentioning: Jan van Huchtenburgh (1647–1733), the brothers Jan Frans (1683–1750) and Joseph van Bredael (1688–1739) as well as Carel van Falens (1683–1733).

His registered pupils were Johannes van der Bent, Hendrick Berckman, Eduard Dubois, Nicolas Ficke, Barent Gael, Anthony de Haen, Emanuel Murant, Matthias Scheits, Kort Withold, and his brothers.

<text>The Diocese of Clifton is a Latin Church diocese of the Catholic Church centred at the Cathedral Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Clifton, England.

The diocese covers the City and County of Bristol and the ceremonial counties of Gloucestershire, Somerset, and Wiltshire, an area of . Thus it stretches from Stow-on-the-Wold in the north to Minehead and Watchet in the South. The most north-westerly parishes are in the Forest of Dean, while Marlborough near Swindon is one of the most easterly. The City of Bristol, of which Clifton is a suburb, is the largest centre of population within the Diocese; Swindon is the next biggest. Other well-known cities and towns include Bath, Wells, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Salisbury, Taunton, Shepton Mallet and Weston-super-Mare.

The Clifton Diocese makes up part of the Catholic Association Pilgrimage.

The diocese was erected in 1850; from then until 1911 it was in the ecclesiastical province of Westminster, and has been in the province of Birmingham since then.

==Statistics==
The Diocese has 104 Parishes, or the equivalent. Many have chapels-of-ease or other Mass centres, adding a total of 99 chapels. The parishes are run by a mixture of Diocesan priests, and priests who belong to Religious Orders such as the Benedictines, Franciscans and others.

==Diocesan boundaries==

==History==

The English Reformation suppressed the Catholic hierarchy in England by the mid-16th century. In 1622 the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith created an apostolic vicariate for the whole of England, which was divided into four districts in 1688. The Western District, comprising the whole of Wales and the present Dioceses of Plymouth and Clifton, was by far the poorest. The hierarchy was restored in 1850 by Pope Pius IX, and the Western District was created the Diocese of Clifton, so-called because the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851 (repealed 20 years later by the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1871) made it illegal for Catholic dioceses to use the same title as current or former Anglican dioceses, despite the fact that the Diocese of Clifton had its Cathedral Church within the City of Bristol. The apostolic vicar William Joseph Hendren was appointed as the first bishop.

In 1830, in an attempt to ensure a supply of priests for the district, Bishop Peter Baines, the Vicar-Apostolic, had bought the Prior Park estate near Bath and had established there a school and a seminary, now Prior Park College. Although an academic success the college was a financial disaster. Bishop Hendren resigned in 1851 realising his inability to do anything about the huge debts on the college. His successor, Bishop Thomas Burgess, died in 1854 without doing anything to solve the problem.

A Decree of the Sacred College promulgated on 22 December 1855 prevented the appointment of a new Bishop of Clifton until the problems of the college had been solved. Instead, an administrator was appointed who would manage the affairs of the diocese until a bishop was appointed. He was Archbishop Errington, Co-Adjutor to Cardinal Wiseman the Archbishop of Westminster. He arrived at Prior Park at the end of October 1855, but was not able to do anything to preserve the college. A Court Order was enforced against the college for non-payment of rent, and the contents of the college were sold by auction, and the premises vacated.

The problem of Prior Park having been settled, a new Bishop of Clifton was appointed. William Clifford, the second son of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh in Devon, was consecrated by Pope Pius IX on 15 February 1857, and enthroned at the pro-cathedral on 17 March 1857. For the next 36 years he guided the diocese to prosperity.
The pro-cathedral had an unfortunate history. Work on the building started in 1834 but ceased the following year when the foundations failed. The half-finished building was abandoned in 1843 when a second attempt to reinforce the foundations again failed. Bishop William Ullathorne, Vicar-Apostolic from 1846 to 1848, had a roof placed on the half-finished building so that it could be used as a church, but Bishop Clifford, with the advice of the architect Charles Hansom, had it converted into a reasonable pro-cathedral. He also re-purchased Prior Park and re-opened the school and the seminary, much of the expense being found by the bishop&#x27;s family. Bishop Clifford died in 1893. His successor, Bishop William Brownlow, was consecrated in 1894 and died in 1901.

Brownlow&#x27;s successor, Bishop George Ambrose Burton, a priest of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle, was Bishop of Clifton for the next 29 years. An outstanding scholar, he was an authority on ancient manuscripts and catalogued the documents which now form the basis of the Diocesan Archives. He saw the magnificent Benedictine Downside Abbey completed, and he welcomed a second Benedictine community when the convert community from Caldey Island came to the diocese to settle at Prinknash Abbey.

Bishop William Lee, who had been secretary to Bishop Burton, succeeded him in 1931. During his 16 years as bishop, he founded 72 new parishes and Mass Centres. His successor, Bishop Joseph Rudderham, a priest of the Diocese of Northampton, was consecrated at Clifton on 26 July 1949. The financial demands made on the people of the diocese to provide new schools to comply with the provisions of the Education Act 1944 resulted in expenditure of £332,000 between 1949 and 1960. In spite of these demands, the building of a new cathedral was undertaken in 1968. On the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, 1973, in the presence of a vast gathering of religious and civic dignitaries, Bishop Rudderham took possession of the current Clifton Cathedral.

Bishop Rudderham resigned his See in August 1974 and died in retirement in February 1979. His auxiliary bishop, Bishop Mervyn Alexander was appointed eighth Bishop of Clifton in December 1974 and guided the diocese for the next 27 years. He then retired to Weston-super-Mare as parish priest at St Joseph&#x27;s. In March 2001, Bishop Declan Lang was ordained as the ninth Bishop of Clifton.

<text>Israel Joshua Singer (Yiddish: ישראל יהושע זינגער ; November 30, 1893, Biłgoraj, Congress Poland — February 10, 1944 New York) was a Polish-Jewish novelist who wrote in Yiddish.

==Biography==
He was born Yisruel Yehoyshye Zinger, the son of Pinchas Mendl Zynger, a rabbi and author of rabbinic commentaries, and Szewa Zylberman. He was the brother of the author Isaac Bashevis Singer and novelist Esther Kreitman. He married Genia Kupferstok. His eldest son, Yasha, died at 14 of pneumonia before the family&#x27;s emigration to America. His younger son, Joseph Singer, was the translator for both his father&#x27;s works and his uncle&#x27;s, Isaac Bashevis Singer. Joseph, a painter and writer like his father, married June Flaum Singer, who went on to become a writer. They had four children: Sharon Salinger, Brett Singer, I.J. Singer and Valerie Singer. The three daughters followed in the family business and are also published poets and novelists.

Singer contributed to the European Yiddish press from 1916. In 1919, he and his wife Genia went to Ukraine, where he found work on a newspaper, &quot;The New Times&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Kiev Writers&quot;. Then they moved to Moscow, where he published articles and stories. After two hard years, in 1921, they returned to Warsaw. In 1921, after Abraham Cahan noticed his story &quot;Pearls&quot;, Singer became a correspondent for the American Yiddish newspaper &quot;The Forward&quot;. His short story &quot;Liuk&quot; appeared in 1924, illuminating the ideological confusion of the Bolshevik Revolution. He wrote his first novel, &quot;Steel and Iron&quot;, in 1927. In 1934 he emigrated to the United States to write for &quot;The Forward&quot;.
Eventually, Israel Joshua invited his younger brother, the future Nobel prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer, to the United States and engineered for him a job with &quot;The Forward&quot;. 
&quot;Had it not been for Joshua, Abraham Cahan would have fired him&quot;, I. J. Singer&#x27;s wife Genia later told I. B. Singer&#x27;s son Israel Zamir.
I. J. Singer died of a heart attack at age 50 at his home in New York City, at 258 Riverside Drive, on February 10, 1944.

==Works==

In the introduction to &quot;A Treasury of Yiddish Stories&quot;, Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg stated that Singer&#x27;s books are organized &quot;in a way that satisfies the usual Western expectations as to literary structure. His novels resemble the kind of family chronicle popular in Europe several decades ago [that is, the turn of the century]&quot;.

<text>DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome. In human cells, both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage, resulting in tens of thousands of individual molecular lesions per cell per day. Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell&#x27;s ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes. Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell&#x27;s genome, which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis. As a consequence, the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure. When normal repair processes fail, and when cellular apoptosis does not occur, irreparable DNA damage may occur. This can eventually lead to malignant tumors, or cancer as per the two-hit hypothesis.

The rate of DNA repair depends on various factors, including the cell type, the age of the cell, and the extracellular environment. A cell that has accumulated a large amount of DNA damage or can no longer effectively repair its DNA may enter one of three possible states:
# an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence
# cell suicide, also known as apoptosis or programmed cell death
# unregulated cell division, which can lead to the formation of a tumor that is cancerous

The DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism. Many genes that were initially shown to influence life span have turned out to be involved in DNA damage repair and protection.
The 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar for their work on the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair processes.

==DNA damage==

DNA damage, due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs at a rate of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes at most only 0.0003125% of the human genome&#x27;s approximately 3.2 billion bases, unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell&#x27;s ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumor heterogeneity.

The vast majority of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix; that is, the bases themselves are chemically modified. These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules&#x27; regular helical structure by introducing non-native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix. Unlike proteins and RNA, DNA usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level. DNA is, however, supercoiled and wound around &quot;packaging&quot; proteins called histones (in eukaryotes), and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage.

===Sources===
DNA damage can be subdivided into two main types:

# endogenous damage such as attack by reactive oxygen species produced from normal metabolic byproducts (spontaneous mutation), especially the process of oxidative deamination
## also includes replication errors
# exogenous damage caused by external agents such as
## ultraviolet (UV) radiation (200–400 nm) from the sun or other artificial light sources
## other radiation frequencies, including x-rays and gamma rays
## hydrolysis or thermal disruption
## certain plant toxins
## human-made mutagenic chemicals, especially aromatic compounds that act as DNA intercalating agents
## viruses

The replication of damaged DNA before cell division can lead to the incorporation of wrong bases opposite damaged ones. Daughter cells that inherit these wrong bases carry mutations from which the original DNA sequence is unrecoverable (except in the rare case of a back mutation, for example, through gene conversion).

===Types===
There are several types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes:
# &quot;oxidation&quot; of bases [e.g. 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)] and generation of DNA strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species,
# &quot;alkylation&quot; of bases (usually methylation), such as formation of 7-methylguanosine, 1-methyladenine, 6-O-Methylguanine
# &quot;hydrolysis&quot; of bases, such as deamination, depurination, and depyrimidination.
# &quot;bulky adduct formation&quot; (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-dG adduct, aristolactam I-dA adduct)
# &quot;mismatch&quot; of bases, due to errors in DNA replication, in which the wrong DNA base is stitched into place in a newly forming DNA strand, or a DNA base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted.
# Monoadduct damage cause by change in single nitrogenous base of DNA
# Di adduct damage

Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms. Some examples are:
# Absorption of &quot;UV light&quot; directly by DNA induces photochemical reactions, leading to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, and photoionization, provoking oxidative damage.
# &quot;UV-A light&quot; creates mostly free radicals. The damage caused by free radicals is called indirect DNA damage.
# &quot;Ionizing radiation&quot; such as that created by radioactive decay or in &quot;cosmic rays&quot; causes breaks in DNA strands. Intermediate-level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage (leading to replicational and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions) leading to pre-mature aging and cancer.
# &quot;Thermal disruption&quot; at elevated temperature increases the rate of depurination (loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination is seen in the thermophilic bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40–80 °C. The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.
# &quot;Industrial chemicals&quot; such as vinyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide, and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethanoates, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphodiesters and crosslinking of DNA, just to name a few.

UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage. Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base, deamination, sugar ring puckering and tautomeric shift. Constitutive (spontaneous) DNA damage caused by endogenous oxidants can be detected as a low level of histone H2AX phosphorylation in untreated cells.

===Nuclear versus mitochondrial===
In eukaryotic cells, DNA is found in two cellular locations – inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unraveled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.

===Senescence and apoptosis===
Senescence, an irreversible process in which the cell no longer divides, is a protective response to the shortening of the chromosome ends, called telomeres. The telomeres are long regions of repetitive noncoding DNA that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division (see Hayflick limit). In contrast, quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage (see cell cycle). Senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism, which serves as a &quot;last resort&quot; mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro-growth cellular signaling. Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor (see cancer), which is potentially lethal to an organism. Therefore, the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered to be part of a strategy of protection against cancer.

===Mutation===
It is important to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of error in DNA. DNA damage and mutation are fundamentally different. Damage results in physical abnormalities in the DNA, such as single- and double-strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired if redundant information, such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome, is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented, and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked or the cell may die.

In contrast to DNA damage, a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce.

Although distinctly different from each other, DNA damage and mutation are related because DNA damage often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these errors are a major source of mutation.

Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation, it can be seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell&#x27;s survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.

==Mechanisms==
Cells cannot function if DNA damage corrupts the integrity and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending on the type of damage inflicted on the DNA&#x27;s double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.

Damage to DNA alters the spatial configuration of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell. Once damage is localized, specific DNA repair molecules bind at or near the site of damage, inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place.

===Direct reversal===
Cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of the four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500 nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the enzyme methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.

===Single-strand damage===

When only one of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand can be used as a template to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.
# Base excision repair (BER): damaged single bases or nucleotides are most commonly repaired by removing the base or the nucleotide involved and then inserting the correct base or nucleotide. In base excision repair, a glycosylase enzyme removes the damaged base from the DNA by cleaving the bond between the base and the deoxyribose. These enzymes remove a single base to create an apurinic or apyrimidinic site (AP site). Enzymes called AP endonucleases nick the damaged DNA backbone at the AP site. DNA polymerase then removes the damaged region using its 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; exonuclease activity and correctly synthesizes the new strand using the complementary strand as a template. The gap is then sealed by enzyme DNA ligase.
# Nucleotide excision repair (NER): bulky, helix-distorting damage, such as pyrimidine dimerization caused by UV light is usually repaired by a three-step process. First the damage is recognized, then 12-24 nucleotide-long strands of DNA are removed both upstream and downstream of the damage site by endonucleases, and the removed DNA region is then resynthesized. NER is a highly evolutionarily conserved repair mechanism and is used in nearly all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. In prokaryotes, NER is mediated by Uvr proteins. In eukaryotes, many more proteins are involved, although the general strategy is the same.
# Mismatch repair systems are present in essentially all cells to correct errors that are not corrected by proofreading. These systems consist of at least two proteins. One detects the mismatch, and the other recruits an endonuclease that cleaves the newly synthesized DNA strand close to the region of damage. In &quot;E. coli &quot;, the proteins involved are the Mut class proteins: MutS, MutL, and MutH. In most Eukaryotes, the analog for MutS is MSH and the analog for MutL is MLH. MutH is only present in bacteria. This is followed by removal of damaged region by an exonuclease, resynthesis by DNA polymerase, and nick sealing by DNA ligase. 

===Double-strand breaks===
Double-strand breaks, in which both strands in the double helix are severed, are particularly hazardous to the cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements. In fact, when a double-strand break is accompanied by a cross-linkage joining the two strands at the same point, neither strand can be used as a template for the repair mechanisms, so that the cell will not be able to complete mitosis when it next divides, and will either die or, in rare cases, undergo a mutation. Three mechanisms exist to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs): non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and homologous recombination (HR):
# In NHEJ, DNA Ligase IV, a specialized DNA ligase that forms a complex with the cofactor XRCC4, directly joins the two ends. To guide accurate repair, NHEJ relies on short homologous sequences called microhomologies present on the single-stranded tails of the DNA ends to be joined. If these overhangs are compatible, repair is usually accurate. NHEJ can also introduce mutations during repair. Loss of damaged nucleotides at the break site can lead to deletions, and joining of nonmatching termini forms insertions or translocations. NHEJ is especially important before the cell has replicated its DNA, since there is no template available for repair by homologous recombination. There are &quot;backup&quot; NHEJ pathways in higher eukaryotes. Besides its role as a genome caretaker, NHEJ is required for joining hairpin-capped double-strand breaks induced during V(D)J recombination, the process that generates diversity in B-cell and T-cell receptors in the vertebrate immune system.
# MMEJ starts with short-range end resection by MRE11 nuclease on either side of a double-strand break to reveal microhomology regions. In further steps, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is required and may be an early step in MMEJ. There is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to remove overhanging flaps. This is followed by recruitment of XRCC1–LIG3 to the site for ligating the DNA ends, leading to an intact DNA. MMEJ is always accompanied by a deletion, so that MMEJ is a mutagenic pathway for DNA repair.
# HR requires the presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as a template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.

In an &quot;in vitro&quot; system, MMEJ occurred in mammalian cells at the levels of 10–20% of HR when both HR and NHEJ mechanisms were also available.

The extremophile &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; has a remarkable ability to survive DNA damage from ionizing radiation and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until complementary partner strands are found. In the final step, there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent homologous recombination.

Topoisomerases introduce both single- and double-strand breaks in the course of changing the DNA&#x27;s state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork. Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them.

Another type of DNA double-strand breaks originates from the DNA heat-sensitive or heat-labile sites. These DNA sites are not initial DSBs. However, they convert to DSB after treating with elevated temperature. Ionizing irradiation can induces a highly complex form of DNA damage as clustered damage. It consists of different types of DNA lesions in various locations of the DNA helix. Some of these closely located lesions can probably convert to DSB by exposure to high temperatures. But the exact nature of these lesions and their interactions is not yet known

===Translesion synthesis===
Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites. It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V, from the Y Polymerase family), often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides. The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by, among other factors, the post-translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA. Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity (high propensity to insert wrong bases) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases. However, many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage. For example, Pol η mediates error-free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation, whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites. Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T^T photodimer using Watson-Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing. From a cellular perspective, risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair, which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death. In short, the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication. For example, Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine-thymine intra-strand crosslink, G[8,5-Me]T, although it can cause targeted and semi-targeted mutations. Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; by replicating a G[8,5-Me]T-modified plasmid in &quot;E. coli&quot; with specific DNA polymerase knockouts. Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II, pol IV, and pol V, the three SOS-inducible DNA polymerases, indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases.
A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At a site of lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, as in the case of Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.

==Global response to DNA damage==
Cells exposed to ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light or chemicals are prone to acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double-strand breaks. Moreover, DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The accumulation of damage, to be specific, double-strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks, are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage. The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells&#x27; own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair, lesion bypass, tolerance, or apoptosis. The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cell division.

===Initial steps===
The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action. To allow DNA repair, the chromatin must be remodeled. In eukaryotes, ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes are two predominant factors employed to accomplish this remodeling process.

Chromatin relaxation occurs rapidly at the site of a DNA damage. In one of the earliest steps, the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks or other DNA damage. This post-translational modification facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites, and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. PARP1 protein starts to appear at DNA damage sites in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs. PARP1 synthesizes polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly (ADP-ribose) or PAR) chains on itself. Next the chromatin remodeler ALC1 quickly attaches to the product of PARP1 action, a poly-ADP ribose chain, and ALC1 completes arrival at the DNA damage within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the damage. About half of the maximum chromatin relaxation, presumably due to action of ALC1, occurs by 10 seconds. This then allows recruitment of the DNA repair enzyme MRE11, to initiate DNA repair, within 13 seconds.

γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of H2AX is also involved in the early steps leading to chromatin decondensation after DNA double-strand breaks. The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139) can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of γH2AX occurs in one minute. The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs at the site of a DNA double-strand break. γH2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of irradiation, RNF8 protein can be detected in association with γH2AX. RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with CHD4, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex NuRD.

DDB2 occurs in a heterodimeric complex with DDB1. This complex further complexes with the ubiquitin ligase protein CUL4A and with PARP1. This larger complex rapidly associates with UV-induced damage within chromatin, with half-maximum association completed in 40 seconds. The PARP1 protein, attached to both DDB1 and DDB2, then PARylates (creates a poly-ADP ribose chain) on DDB2 that attracts the DNA remodeling protein ALC1. Action of ALC1 relaxes the chromatin at the site of UV damage to DNA. This relaxation allows other proteins in the nucleotide excision repair pathway to enter the chromatin and repair UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer damages.

After rapid chromatin remodeling, cell cycle checkpoints are activated to allow DNA repair to occur before the cell cycle progresses. First, two kinases, ATM and ATR are activated within 5 or 6 minutes after DNA is damaged. This is followed by phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein Chk1, initiating its function, about 10 minutes after DNA is damaged.

===DNA damage checkpoints===
After DNA damage, cell cycle checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint activation pauses the cell cycle and gives the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.

DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down the rate of S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide.

Checkpoint Proteins can be separated into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses is a pair of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.

An important downstream target of ATM and ATR is p53, as it is required for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.

===The prokaryotic SOS response===
The SOS response is the changes in gene expression in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences commonly referred to as SOS boxes. In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS response is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.
The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.

In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, SOS boxes are 20-nucleotide long sequences near promoters with palindromic structure and a high degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD&#x27;2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression.

===Eukaryotic transcriptional responses to DNA damage===
Eukaryotic cells exposed to DNA damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response indicates that a general global stress response pathway exist at the level of transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.

In general global response to DNA damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for postreplication repair, homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, DNA damage checkpoint, global transcriptional activation, genes controlling mRNA decay, and many others. A large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision: undergo apoptosis and die, or survive at the cost of living with a modified genome. An increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations. Yeast Rev1 and human polymerase η are members of Y family translesion DNA polymerases present during global response to DNA damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to DNA damage in eukaryotes.

==Aging==
===Pathological effects of poor DNA repair===
Experimental animals with genetic deficiencies in DNA repair often show decreased life span and increased cancer incidence. For example, mice deficient in the dominant NHEJ pathway and in telomere maintenance mechanisms get lymphoma and infections more often, and, as a consequence, have shorter lifespans than wild-type mice. In similar manner, mice deficient in a key repair and transcription protein that unwinds DNA helices have premature onset of aging-related diseases and consequent shortening of lifespan. However, not every DNA repair deficiency creates exactly the predicted effects; mice deficient in the NER pathway exhibited shortened life span without correspondingly higher rates of mutation.

The maximum life spans of mice, naked mole-rats and humans are respectively ~3, ~30 and ~129 years. Of these, the shortest lived species, mouse, expresses DNA repair genes, including core genes in several DNA repair pathways, at a lower level than do humans and naked mole rats. Furthermore several DNA repair pathways in humans and naked mole-rats are up-regulated compared to mouse. These observations suggest that elevated DNA repair facilitates greater longevity.

If the rate of DNA damage exceeds the capacity of the cell to repair it, the accumulation of errors can overwhelm the cell and result in early senescence, apoptosis, or cancer. Inherited diseases associated with faulty DNA repair functioning result in premature aging, increased sensitivity to carcinogens and correspondingly increased cancer risk (see below). On the other hand, organisms with enhanced DNA repair systems, such as &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;, the most radiation-resistant known organism, exhibit remarkable resistance to the double-strand break-inducing effects of radioactivity, likely due to enhanced efficiency of DNA repair and especially NHEJ.

===Longevity and caloric restriction===

A number of individual genes have been identified as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms. The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment, in particular, on the organism&#x27;s diet. Caloric restriction reproducibly results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms, likely via nutrient sensing pathways and decreased metabolic rate. The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear (see for some discussion); however, the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction. Several agents reported to have anti-aging properties have been shown to attenuate constitutive level of mTOR signaling, an evidence of reduction of metabolic activity, and concurrently to reduce constitutive level of DNA damage induced by endogenously generated reactive oxygen species.

For example, increasing the gene dosage of the gene SIR-2, which regulates DNA packaging in the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, can significantly extend lifespan. The mammalian homolog of SIR-2 is known to induce downstream DNA repair factors involved in NHEJ, an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction. Caloric restriction has been closely linked to the rate of base excision repair in the nuclear DNA of rodents, although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial DNA.

The &quot;C. elegans&quot; gene AGE-1, an upstream effector of DNA repair pathways, confers dramatically extended life span under free-feeding conditions but leads to a decrease in reproductive fitness under conditions of caloric restriction. This observation supports the pleiotropy theory of the biological origins of aging, which suggests that genes conferring a large survival advantage early in life will be selected for even if they carry a corresponding disadvantage late in life.

==Medicine and DNA repair modulation==
===Hereditary DNA repair disorders===
Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for several genetic disorders, including:
* Xeroderma pigmentosum: hypersensitivity to sunlight/UV, resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging
* Cockayne syndrome: hypersensitivity to UV and chemical agents
* Trichothiodystrophy: sensitive skin, brittle hair and nails

Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders, suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons.

Other DNA repair disorders include:
* Werner&#x27;s syndrome: premature aging and retarded growth
* Bloom&#x27;s syndrome: sunlight hypersensitivity, high incidence of malignancies (especially leukemias).
* Ataxia telangiectasia: sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents

All of the above diseases are often called &quot;segmental progerias&quot; (&quot;accelerated aging diseases&quot;) because those affected appear elderly and experience aging-related diseases at an abnormally young age, while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age.

Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include Fanconi anemia, hereditary breast cancer and hereditary colon cancer.

==Cancer==
Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. There are at least 34 Inherited human DNA repair gene mutations that increase cancer risk. Many of these mutations cause DNA repair to be less effective than normal. In particular, Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is strongly associated with specific mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway. &quot;BRCA1&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot;, two important genes whose mutations confer a hugely increased risk of breast cancer on carriers, are both associated with a large number of DNA repair pathways, especially NHEJ and homologous recombination.

Cancer therapy procedures such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy work by overwhelming the capacity of the cell to repair DNA damage, resulting in cell death. Cells that are most rapidly dividing – most typically cancer cells – are preferentially affected. The side-effect is that other non-cancerous but rapidly dividing cells such as progenitor cells in the gut, skin, and hematopoietic system are also affected. Modern cancer treatments attempt to localize the DNA damage to cells and tissues only associated with cancer, either by physical means (concentrating the therapeutic agent in the region of the tumor) or by biochemical means (exploiting a feature unique to cancer cells in the body). In the context of therapies targeting DNA damage response genes, the latter approach has been termed &#x27;synthetic lethality&#x27;.

Perhaps the most well-known of these &#x27;synthetic lethality&#x27; drugs is the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor olaparib, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for the treatment in women of BRCA-defective ovarian cancer. Tumor cells with partial loss of DNA damage response (specifically, homologous recombination repair) are dependent on another mechanism – single-strand break repair – which is a mechanism consisting, in part, of the PARP1 gene product. Olaparib is combined with chemotherapeutics to inhibit single-strand break repair induced by DNA damage caused by the co-administered chemotherapy. Tumor cells relying on this residual DNA repair mechanism are unable to repair the damage and hence are not able to survive and proliferate, whereas normal cells can repair the damage with the functioning homologous recombination mechanism.

Many other drugs for use against other residual DNA repair mechanisms commonly found in cancer are currently under investigation. However, synthetic lethality therapeutic approaches have been questioned due to emerging evidence of acquired resistance, achieved through rewiring of DNA damage response pathways and reversion of previously inhibited defects.

===DNA repair defects in cancer===
It has become apparent over the past several years that the DNA damage response acts as a barrier to the malignant transformation of preneoplastic cells. Previous studies have shown an elevated DNA damage response in cell-culture models with oncogene activation and preneoplastic colon adenomas. DNA damage response mechanisms trigger cell-cycle arrest, and attempt to repair DNA lesions or promote cell death/senescence if repair is not possible. Replication stress is observed in preneoplastic cells due to increased proliferation signals from oncogenic mutations. Replication stress is characterized by: increased replication initiation/origin firing; increased transcription and collisions of transcription-replication complexes; nucleotide deficiency; increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Replication stress, along with the selection for inactivating mutations in DNA damage response genes in the evolution of the tumor, leads to downregulation and/or loss of some DNA damage response mechanisms, and hence loss of DNA repair and/or senescence/programmed cell death. In experimental mouse models, loss of DNA damage response-mediated cell senescence was observed after using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to inhibit the double-strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), leading to increased tumor size and invasiveness. Humans born with inherited defects in DNA repair mechanisms (for example, Li-Fraumeni syndrome) have a higher cancer risk.

The prevalence of DNA damage response mutations differs across cancer types; for example, 30% of breast invasive carcinomas have mutations in genes involved in homologous recombination. In cancer, downregulation is observed across all DNA damage response mechanisms (base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination repair (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). As well as mutations to DNA damage repair genes, mutations also arise in the genes responsible for arresting the cell cycle to allow sufficient time for DNA repair to occur, and some genes are involved in both DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint control, for example ATM and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) – a tumor suppressor that is often absent or downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer.

===Epigenetic DNA repair defects in cancer===
Classically, cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, and chromosomal aberrations. However, it has become apparent that cancer is also driven by epigenetic alterations.

Epigenetic alterations refer to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation) and histone modification, changes in chromosomal architecture (caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as HMGA2 or HMGA1) and changes caused by microRNAs. Each of these epigenetic alterations serves to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes usually remain through cell divisions, last for multiple cell generations, and can be considered to be epimutations (equivalent to mutations).

While large numbers of epigenetic alterations are found in cancers, the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes, causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins, appear to be particularly important. Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers.

Reduced expression of DNA repair genes causes deficient DNA repair. When DNA repair is deficient DNA damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation. Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair (HRR). Chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy also increase in HRR defective cells.

Higher levels of DNA damage not only cause increased mutation, but also cause increased epimutation. During repair of DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other DNA damages, incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing.

Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause increased risk of cancer. Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes (see article DNA repair-deficiency disorder) have an increased risk of cancer, with some defects causing up to a 100% lifetime chance of cancer (e.g. p53 mutations). However, such germline mutations (which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers.

===Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes===
Deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes are occasionally caused by a newly arising somatic mutation in a DNA repair gene, but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes. For example, when 113 colorectal cancers were examined in sequence, only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT, while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region (an epigenetic alteration). Five different studies found that between 40% and 90% of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region.

Similarly, out of 119 cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression, PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene, while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation (PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1). In the other 10 cases, loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA, miR-155, which down-regulates MLH1.

In a further example, epigenetic defects were found in various cancers (e.g. breast, ovarian, colorectal and head and neck). Two or three deficiencies in the expression of ERCC1, XPF or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of 49 colon cancers evaluated by Facista et al.

The chart in this section shows some frequent DNA damaging agents, examples of DNA lesions they cause, and the pathways that deal with these DNA damages. At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes. Of these, 83 are directly employed in repairing the 5 types of DNA damages illustrated in the chart.

Some of the more well studied genes central to these repair processes are shown in the chart. The gene designations shown in red, gray or cyan indicate genes frequently epigenetically altered in various types of cancers. Wikipedia articles on each of the genes highlighted by red, gray or cyan describe the epigenetic alteration(s) and the cancer(s) in which these epimutations are found. Review articles, and broad experimental survey articles also document most of these epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies in cancers.

Red-highlighted genes are frequently reduced or silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in various cancers. When these genes have low or absent expression, DNA damages can accumulate. Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) can lead to increased mutations and, ultimately, cancer. Epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in accurate DNA repair pathways appear to be central to carcinogenesis.

The two gray-highlighted genes &quot;RAD51&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot;, are required for homologous recombinational repair. They are sometimes epigenetically over-expressed and sometimes under-expressed in certain cancers. As indicated in the Wikipedia articles on RAD51 and BRCA2, such cancers ordinarily have epigenetic deficiencies in other DNA repair genes. These repair deficiencies would likely cause increased unrepaired DNA damages. The over-expression of &quot;RAD51&quot; and &quot;BRCA2&quot; seen in these cancers may reflect selective pressures for compensatory &quot;RAD51&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; over-expression and increased homologous recombinational repair to at least partially deal with such excess DNA damages. In those cases where &quot;RAD51&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; are under-expressed, this would itself lead to increased unrepaired DNA damages. Replication errors past these damages (see translesion synthesis) could cause increased mutations and cancer, so that under-expression of &quot;RAD51&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; would be carcinogenic in itself.

Cyan-highlighted genes are in the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway and are up-regulated in cancer. MMEJ is an additional error-prone &quot;inaccurate&quot; repair pathway for double-strand breaks. In MMEJ repair of a double-strand break, an homology of 5–25 complementary base pairs between both paired strands is sufficient to align the strands, but mismatched ends (flaps) are usually present. MMEJ removes the extra nucleotides (flaps) where strands are joined, and then ligates the strands to create an intact DNA double helix. MMEJ almost always involves at least a small deletion, so that it is a mutagenic pathway. FEN1, the flap endonuclease in MMEJ, is epigenetically increased by promoter hypomethylation and is over-expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung. PARP1 is also over-expressed when its promoter region ETS site is epigenetically hypomethylated, and this contributes to progression to endometrial cancer and BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer. Other genes in the MMEJ pathway are also over-expressed in a number of cancers (see MMEJ for summary), and are also shown in cyan.

===Genome-wide distribution of DNA repair in human somatic cells===
Differential activity of DNA repair pathways across various regions of the human genome causes mutations to be very unevenly distributed within tumor genomes. In particular, the gene-rich, early-replicating regions of the human genome exhibit lower mutation frequencies than the gene-poor, late-replicating heterochromatin. One mechanism underlying this involves the histone modification H3K36me3, which can recruit mismatch repair proteins, thereby lowering mutation rates in H3K36me3-marked regions. Another important mechanism concerns nucleotide excision repair, which can be recruited by the transcription machinery, lowering somatic mutation rates in active genes and other open chromatin regions.

==Epigenetic alterations due to DNA repair==
Damage to DNA is very common and is constantly being repaired. Epigenetic alterations can accompany DNA repair of oxidative damage or double-strand breaks. In human cells, oxidative DNA damage occurs about 10,000 times a day and DNA double-strand breaks occur about 10 to 50 times a cell cycle in somatic replicating cells (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)). The selective advantage of DNA repair is to allow the cell to survive in the face of DNA damage. The selective advantage of epigenetic alterations that occur with DNA repair is not clear.

===Repair of oxidative DNA damage can alter epigenetic markers===
In the steady state (with endogenous damages occurring and being repaired), there are about 2,400 oxidatively damaged guanines that form 8-oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the average mammalian cell DNA. 8-OHdG constitutes about 5% of the oxidative damages commonly present in DNA. The oxidized guanines do not occur randomly among all guanines in DNA. There is a sequence preference for the guanine at a methylated CpG site (a cytosine followed by guanine along its 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; direction and where the cytosine is methylated (5-mCpG)). A 5-mCpG site has the lowest ionization potential for guanine oxidation.

Oxidized guanine has mispairing potential and is mutagenic. Oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) is the primary enzyme responsible for the excision of the oxidized guanine during DNA repair. OGG1 finds and binds to an 8-OHdG within a few seconds. However, OGG1 does not immediately excise 8-OHdG. In HeLa cells half maximum removal of 8-OHdG occurs in 30 minutes, and in irradiated mice, the 8-OHdGs induced in the mouse liver are removed with a half-life of 11 minutes.

When OGG1 is present at an oxidized guanine within a methylated CpG site it recruits TET1 to the 8-OHdG lesion (see Figure). This allows TET1 to demethylate an adjacent methylated cytosine. Demethylation of cytosine is an epigenetic alteration.

As an example, when human mammary epithelial cells were treated with H2O2 for six hours, 8-OHdG increased about 3.5-fold in DNA and this caused about 80% demethylation of the 5-methylcytosines in the genome. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene into messenger RNA. In cells treated with H2O2, one particular gene was examined, &quot;BACE1&quot;. The methylation level of the &quot;BACE1&quot; CpG island was reduced (an epigenetic alteration) and this allowed about 6.5 fold increase of expression of &quot;BACE1&quot; messenger RNA.

While six-hour incubation with H2O2 causes considerable demethylation of 5-mCpG sites, shorter times of H2O2 incubation appear to promote other epigenetic alterations. Treatment of cells with H2O2 for 30 minutes causes the mismatch repair protein heterodimer MSH2-MSH6 to recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to sites of some kinds of oxidative DNA damage. This could cause increased methylation of cytosines (epigenetic alterations) at these locations.

Jiang et al. treated HEK 293 cells with agents causing oxidative DNA damage, (potassium bromate (KBrO3) or potassium chromate (K2CrO4)). Base excision repair (BER) of oxidative damage occurred with the DNA repair enzyme polymerase beta localizing to oxidized guanines. Polymerase beta is the main human polymerase in short-patch BER of oxidative DNA damage. Jiang et al. also found that polymerase beta recruited the DNA methyltransferase protein DNMT3b to BER repair sites. They then evaluated the methylation pattern at the single nucleotide level in a small region of DNA including the promoter region and the early transcription region of the BRCA1 gene. Oxidative DNA damage from bromate modulated the DNA methylation pattern (caused epigenetic alterations) at CpG sites within the region of DNA studied. In untreated cells, CpGs located at −189, −134, −29, −19, +16, and +19 of the BRCA1 gene had methylated cytosines (where numbering is from the messenger RNA transcription start site, and negative numbers indicate nucleotides in the upstream promoter region). Bromate treatment-induced oxidation resulted in the loss of cytosine methylation at −189, −134, +16 and +19 while also leading to the formation of new methylation at the CpGs located at −80, −55, −21 and +8 after DNA repair was allowed.

===Homologous recombinational repair alters epigenetic markers===
At least four articles report the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to sites of DNA double-strand breaks. During homologous recombinational repair (HR) of the double-strand break, the involvement of DNMT1 causes the two repaired strands of DNA to have different levels of methylated cytosines. One strand becomes frequently methylated at about 21 CpG sites downstream of the repaired double-strand break. The other DNA strand loses methylation at about six CpG sites that were previously methylated downstream of the double-strand break, as well as losing methylation at about five CpG sites that were previously methylated upstream of the double-strand break. When the chromosome is replicated, this gives rise to one daughter chromosome that is heavily methylated downstream of the previous break site and one that is unmethylated in the region both upstream and downstream of the previous break site. With respect to the gene that was broken by the double-strand break, half of the progeny cells express that gene at a high level and in the other half of the progeny cells expression of that gene is repressed. When clones of these cells were maintained for three years, the new methylation patterns were maintained over that time period.

In mice with a CRISPR-mediated homology-directed recombination insertion in their genome there were a large number of increased methylations of CpG sites within the double-strand break-associated insertion.

===Non-homologous end joining can cause some epigenetic marker alterations===
Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of a double-strand break can cause a small number of demethylations of pre-existing cytosine DNA methylations downstream of the repaired double-strand break. Further work by Allen et al. showed that NHEJ of a DNA double-strand break in a cell could give rise to some progeny cells having repressed expression of the gene harboring the initial double-strand break and some progeny having high expression of that gene due to epigenetic alterations associated with NHEJ repair. The frequency of epigenetic alterations causing repression of a gene after an NHEJ repair of a DNA double-strand break in that gene may be about 0.9%.

==Evolution==
The basic processes of DNA repair are highly conserved among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and even among bacteriophages (viruses which infect bacteria); however, more complex organisms with more complex genomes have correspondingly more complex repair mechanisms. The ability of a large number of protein structural motifs to catalyze relevant chemical reactions has played a significant role in the elaboration of repair mechanisms during evolution. For an extremely detailed review of hypotheses relating to the evolution of DNA repair, see.

The fossil record indicates that single-cell life began to proliferate on the planet at some point during the Precambrian period, although exactly when recognizably modern life first emerged is unclear. Nucleic acids became the sole and universal means of encoding genetic information, requiring DNA repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor. The emergence of Earth&#x27;s oxygen-rich atmosphere (known as the &quot;oxygen catastrophe&quot;) due to photosynthetic organisms, as well as the presence of potentially damaging free radicals in the cell due to oxidative phosphorylation, necessitated the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms that act specifically to counter the types of damage induced by oxidative stress. The mechanism by which this came about, however, is unclear.

===Rate of evolutionary change===
On some occasions, DNA damage is not repaired or is repaired by an error-prone mechanism that results in a change from the original sequence. When this occurs, mutations may propagate into the genomes of the cell&#x27;s progeny. Should such an event occur in a germ line cell that will eventually produce a gamete, the mutation has the potential to be passed on to the organism&#x27;s offspring. The rate of evolution in a particular species (or, in a particular gene) is a function of the rate of mutation. As a consequence, the rate and accuracy of DNA repair mechanisms have an influence over the process of evolutionary change. DNA damage protection and repair does not influence the rate of adaptation by gene regulation and by recombination and selection of alleles. On the other hand, DNA damage repair and protection does influence the rate of accumulation of irreparable, advantageous, code expanding, inheritable mutations, and slows down the evolutionary mechanism for expansion of the genome of organisms with new functionalities. The tension between evolvability and mutation repair and protection needs further investigation.

==Technology==
A technology named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (shortened to CRISPR-Cas9) was discovered in 2012. The new technology allows anyone with molecular biology training to alter the genes of any species with precision, by inducing DNA damage at a specific point and then altering DNA repair mechanisms to insert new genes. It is cheaper, more efficient, and more precise than other technologies. With the help of CRISPR–Cas9, parts of a genome can be edited by scientists by removing, adding, or altering parts in a DNA sequence.

<text>Isaac van Ostade (bapt. June 2, 1621 – buried October 16, 1649) was a Dutch genre and landscape painter.

==Biography==
Van Ostade was born in Haarlem. He began his studies under his brother, Adriaen, with whom he remained until 1641, when he started his own practice. At an early period he felt the influence of Rembrandt, and this is apparent in a &quot;Slaughtered Pig&quot; of 1639, in the gallery of Augsburg. He soon found a style more suited to his own inclinations. He produced pictures in 1641–1642 on the lines of his brother – amongst these, the Five Senses, which Adrian afterwards represented by a &quot;Man reading a Paper&quot;, a &quot;Peasant tasting Beer&quot;, a &quot;Rustic smearing his Sores with Ointment&quot; and a &quot;Countryman sniffing at a Snuff-box&quot;. A specimen of Isaac&#x27;s work at this period may be seen in the &quot;Laughing Boor with a Pot of Beer&quot;, in the museum of Amsterdam; the cottage interior, with two peasants and three children near a fire, in the Berlin museum; a &quot;Concert&quot;, with people listening to singers accompanied by a piper and flute player, and a &quot;Boor stealing a Kiss from a Woman&quot;, in the Lacaze collection at the Louvre.

The interior at Berlin is lighted from a casement in the same Rembrandtesque style as Adrian&#x27;s interior of 1643 at the Louvre. He received low prices for this kind of painting, in which he could only remain subordinate to his brother. Gradually he abandoned Adriaen&#x27;s cottage subjects for landscapes in the fashion of Esaias van de Velde and Salomon van Ruysdael. Once only, in 1645, he reverted to the earlier mode, when he produced the &quot;Slaughtered Pig&quot;, with a boy puffing out a bladder, in the museum of Lille.

Isaac&#x27;s progress in his new path was greatly facilitated by his previous experience as a figure painter; and, although he now selected his subjects either from village high streets or frozen canals, he gave fresh life to the scenes by depicting animated groups of people with a refined and searching study of picturesque contrasts. He did not live long enough to bring his art to the highest perfection. He died on 16 October 1649 in Haarlem, having painted about 400 pictures (see H. de Groot, 1910).

The first manifestation of Isaac&#x27;s surrender of Adriaen&#x27;s style is apparent in 1644 when the skating and sledging scenes were executed which we see in the Lacaze collection and the galleries of the Hermitage, Antwerp and Lille. Three of these examples bear the artists name, spelled Isack van Ostade, and the dates of 1644 and 1645. The roadside inns, with halts of travellers, form a compact series from 1646 to 1649. This is the last form of Isaac&#x27;s art and has very distinct peculiarities. The air which pervades his composition is warm and sunny, yet mellow and hazy, as if the sky were veiled with a vapour coloured by moor smoke. The trees are rubbings of umber, in which the prominent foliage is tipped with touches hardened in a liquid state by amber varnish mediums. The same principle applied to details such as glazed bricks or rents in the mud lining of cottages gives an unreal and conventional stamp to them.

These quirks are overcome by his broad contrasts of light and shade and the masterly figures of horses, riders, travellers, rustics, quarrelling children, dogs, poultry and cattle. A favorite place is always given to the white horse, which seems as invariable an accompaniment as the grey in the skirmishes and fairs of Philip Wouwerman.

Isaac displays the best qualities in winter scenes. The absence of foliage, the crisp atmosphere and the calm air of cold January days, unsullied by smoke or vapour, preclude the use of the brown tinge, and leave the painter no choice but to ring the changes with a great variety of opal tints. Then the figures emerge with masterly effect on the light background. Amongst the roadside inns, there are those in the collections of Buckingham Palace, the National Gallery, London, the Wallace Collection and Holford collections in England, the Louvre, Berlin, Hermitage and Rotterdam museums and the Rothschild collection at Vienna. The finest of the ice scenes is the famous one at the Louvre.

For his etchings see &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre d&#x27;Ostade, cu description des eaux-fortes de ce maître&quot;, etc., by Auguste d&#x27;Orange (1860); and &quot;Catalogue raisonné de toutes les estampes qui forment l&#x27;œuvre grave d&#x27;Adrian van Ostade&quot;, by L.E. Faucheux (Paris, 1862).

<text>Augustin Josip &quot;Tin&quot; Ujević (; 5 July 1891 – 12 November 1955) was a Croatian poet, considered by many to be the greatest poet in 20th century Croatian literature. 

From 1921, he ceased to sign his name as Augustin, thereafter using the signature Tin Ujević.

==Biography==
Ujević was born in Vrgorac, a small town in the Dalmatian hinterland, and attended school in Imotski, Makarska, Split and Zagreb. He completed Classical Gymnasium in Split, and in Zagreb he studied Croatian language and literature, classical Philology, Philosophy, and Aesthetics.

In 1909, while studying literature, his first sonnet &quot;Za novim vidicima&quot; (Towards New Horizons) appeared in the journal &quot;Mlada Hrvatska&quot; (Young Croatia). After the assassination attempts on the ban Slavko Cuvaj in 1912, Ujević became active in the Nationalist youth movement and was repeatedly imprisoned. On the eve of the First World War, he lived briefly in Dubrovnik, Šibenik, Zadar, Rijeka and for a longer time in Split. The crucial period for his political and poetic consciousness was his visit to Paris (1913–19).

After the death of A.G. Matoš in 1914, Ujević published an essay about his teacher in the literary magazine &quot;Savremenik&quot;. That same year the anthology of poetry inspired by Matoš, &quot;Hrvatska mlada lirika&quot; (Croatian Young Lyrics) brought together the work of 12 young poets, including 10 poems by Tin Ujević. Also in that year, Ujević joined the French Foreign Legion, though he left again after 3 months at the urging of Frano Supilo.

In 1919, Ujević returned to Zagreb. Around that time he wrote two autobiographical essays &quot;&quot;Mrsko Ja&quot; (Hateful Me, 1922) examining his political beliefs, which he described as disenchanted, and &quot;Ispit savjesti&quot;&quot; (Examination of Conscience, published in 1923 in the journal &quot;Savremenik),&quot; which he himself called a &quot;sleepwalking sketch&quot;. It is considered to be one of the most moving confessional texts in Croatian literature, in which an author mercilessly examines their own past.

Ujević lived from 1920 to 1926 in Belgrade, then he moved between Split and Zagreb, back to Belgrade, then to Split again. In 1920 his first anthology of poetry &quot;&quot;Lelek sebra&quot; (Cry of a slave) was published in Belgrade, and in 1922 his poem &quot;Visoki jablani&quot;&quot; (High Poplars) appeared in the journal &quot;Putevi&quot; (Roads).

He was well known in bohemian circles in Belgrade and a frequent guest at Hotel Moskva and Skadarlija.

During the years 1930–37, Ujević lived in Sarajevo, then 1937–1940 in Split, finally moving back to Zagreb, where he lived until his death in 1955.

From 1941 to 1945 he did not publish a single book, earning his living as a journalist and translator. Ujević held a post in the Independent State of Croatia as a translator, and continued to publish some material. For this reason, he was forbidden by the Yugoslav government from continuing with his literary career for several years. In the last days of 1950 a selection of his work was published in Zagreb, under the title &quot;Rukovet&quot; (&quot;Handful&quot;). Ujević died on 12 November 1955 and is buried at Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb.

== Legacy ==
In addition to his poetry, Tin Ujević also wrote essays, short stories, serials (feuilletons), studies on foreign and domestic authors, and he translated philosophical discussions from many foreign languages. 

He translated numerous works of poetry, novels and short stories into Croatian (Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, Marcel Proust, Joseph Conrad, Benvenuto Cellini, George Meredith, Emile Verhaeren, Arthur Rimbaud, André Gide, among others).

He wrote more than ten books of essays, poetry in prose and meditations — but his enduring strength lies chiefly in his poetic works. At first a follower of Silvije Strahimir Kranjčević and more especially A.G. Matoš, Ujević soon moved on and developed his own independent voice. 

He preferred the French and American modernists such as Charles Baudelaire, Arthur Rimbaud and Walt Whitman, whose work he translated. His first collections &quot;Lelek sebra&quot;, and &quot;Kolajna&quot;, inspired by his years in Paris, are considered the peak of modern Croatian lyrical poetry. 

From those original first books grew a body of work that is a classic of Croatian literature, and according to the British poet Clive Wilmer, &quot;Tin Ujević was one of the last masters of European Symbolism&quot;. Poet and writer Anne Stevenson says his &quot;melancholy, turn-of-the-century lyricism&quot; is comparable to that of Thomas Hardy, of Edward Thomas, and of early Yeats&quot;.

British poet Richard Berengarten, who has translated some of Ujević&#x27;s best works into English, writes &quot;Although Tin&#x27;s major achievement is as a lyricist, his oeuvre is much broader than lyric alone. He was a writer of profound and discerning intellect, broad and capacious interests, inquisitive appetite and eclectic range.&quot;There are some 380 records about Tin Ujević&#x27;s works in the catalogue of the National and University Library in Zagreb, and part of his literary heritage is preserved in the Library&#x27;s Manuscripts and Old Books Collection. Ujević published his writings in all renowned newspapers and journals, in which numerous articles about Ujević were published, and part of that material in digital format is available at the Portal of Digitized Croatian Newspapers and Journals.

The Tin Ujević Award is the most prestigious poetry award in Croatia. In 2003, the Jadrolinija ferry, MV &quot;Tin Ujević&quot; was named for the poet. In 2005, Hrvatska Pošta issued a stamp in their series of Famous Croats: Tin Ujević on the 50th anniversary of his death. By 2008, a total of 122 streets in Croatia were named after Ujević, making him the ninth most common person for whom streets were named in Croatia. Six streets in Serbia are named after Ujević .

<doc id="854305" wikidata="Q5358078" url="?curid=854305" title="Electromagnetic cavity">
<text>An electromagnetic cavity is a cavity that acts as a container for electromagnetic fields such as photons, in effect containing their wave function inside. The size of the cavity determines the maximum photon wavelength that can be trapped. Additionally, it produces quantized energy levels for trapped charged particles like electrons and protons. The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in effect places the Earth in an electromagnetic cavity.

== Physical description of electromagnetic cavities ==

Electromagnetic cavities are represented by potential wells, also called &quot;boxes&quot;, which can be of limited or unlimited depth V0.

Quantum-mechanic boxes are described by the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

:formula_1

with the additional boundary conditions 
* the wave function is confined to the box (infinite deep potential well) or approaches zero as the distance from the wall increases to infinity, thus normalisable
* the wave function must be continuous
* the derivative of the wave function must be continuous
which leads to real solutions for the wave functions if the net energy of the particle is negative., i.e. if the particle is in a bound state.

== Applications of electromagnetic cavities ==

Electrons which are trapped in an electromagnetic cavity are in a bound state and thus organise themselves as they do in a regular atom, thus expressing chemical-like behaviour. Several researchers have proposed to develop programmable matter by varying the number of trapped electrons in those cavities.

The discrete energy levels of electromagnetic cavities are exploited to produce photons of desired frequencies and thus are essential for nano- or submicrometre-scale laser devices.

<text>Human Frailty is the fourth studio album by Australian rock band Hunters &amp; Collectors, which was released on 7 April 1986. It was a commercial and critical success. The album peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and No. 5 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. Four singles were issued from the album, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, which reached No. 24 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart; &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; (a re-recorded version of a previous single), No. 49; &quot;Everything&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, No. 78; and &quot;Is There Anybody in There&quot;, which did not chart in Australia but did reach No. 41 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

At the 1986 Countdown Australian Music Awards the album was nominated for Best Australian Album.

In October 2010 &quot;Human Frailty&quot; was listed at No. 18 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Human Frailty&quot; was released on 7 April 1986 and is the fourth studio album by Australian rock band Hunters &amp; Collectors. Their line up was John Archer on bass guitar, Doug Falconer on drums, Jack Howard on trumpet, Robert Miles on live sound, Mark Seymour on lead vocals and guitar, Jeremy Smith on French horn, and Michael Waters on keyboards and trombone.

Seymour later told Tracee Hutchison: &quot;I remember having a discussion with [Miles] and [Falconer] in a beergarden at the Standard Hotel in Fitzroy, and I said &#x27;Look, you know, we should try and make a commercial record if we want to take things seriously in the long term.&#x27; I think that was a year before we even started thinking about recording this record&quot;. He recalled for &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (October 2010) that all the tracks are &quot;connected to the relationship that [my then-girlfriend] and I had&quot;.

&quot;Human Frailty&quot; became their first Australian Top Ten album reaching No. 8 on the Australian charts and No. 5 in New Zealand. The lead single from the album, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, was released in February 1986, and peaked at No. 24 in Australia and No. 20 in New Zealand. A third version of &quot;Throw Your Arms Around Me&quot; was recorded for the album and was issued as its second single, which peaked at No. 49 in Australian in May 1986. Eventually it became one of their most popular songs, voted in the Top 5 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1989, 1990, and 1991.

Two further singles from &quot;Human Frailty&quot; were released: &quot;Everything&#x27;s on Fire&quot; in August and &quot;Is There Anybody in There?&quot; in October, both reached the top 50 in New Zealand (No. 44 and 41 respectively) but not in Australia. The album included a cover version of a track originally recorded by Sardine v, &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, written by Ian Rilen and Stephanie Falconer aka Stephanie Rilen.

Hunters &amp; Collectors signed a parallel deal with I.R.S. Records for North America, which released the album in July 1987, although with a different track listing from the Australian version. I.R.S. Records also re-issued the album in a CD format, including all three tracks from the &quot;Living Daylight&quot; extended play (April 1987, Australasia-only). In July 1991 White Label Records re-issued the album on CD, also including &quot;Living Daylight&quot; tracks. Liberation Music released a re-mastered issue of &quot;Human Frailty&quot; on 7 July 2003.

On 20 September 2007, SBS in Australia aired a one-hour documentary on Hunters &amp; Collectors and &quot;Human Frailty&quot; as the part of their &quot;Great Australian Albums&quot; series. The series was subsequently released on DVD on 22 October 2008.

==Reception==

In May 1986 Pollyanna Sutton of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; reviewed &quot;Human Frailty&quot;, she felt that their &quot;early rythmical drum beats, abstract music and sometimes inaudible lyrics have been turned around to produce [the album], something of a showpiece for lead singer, Mark Seymour&quot;. The album had &quot;broadened the band&#x27;s audience, taking away the uncertainty which manifested itself&quot; earlier. In the next month her colleague, Lisa Wallace, declared it &quot;the best album I have heard in a long, longtime. It&#x27;s clean, fresh, emotional and very, very good. Not for many a moon (far too many) has there been an Australian band which has proved itself such a consistent winner&quot;.

Fellow Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noted &quot;Seymour&#x27;s themes of alienation and sexual politics came to the fore&quot; with this album. He described how the group &quot;had discovered how to tap the unique vein they had unearthed; where, in a sweat-dripping venue packed to the rafters with a beer swilling macho rock fans the audience would and could at the top of their voices unselfconsciously sing along to a chorus like &#x27;you don&#x27;t make me feel like a woman any more&#x27;&quot;. While Ian McFarlane saw it showed &quot;further refinement of the sinewy and dynamic approach established on &quot;The Jaws of Life&quot;&quot;.

Allmusic&#x27;s Steve Kurutz saw the group had &quot;finally discovered their true strength; a balance of bass and drum-driven grooves set below punchy horns and counterpoint melody lines&quot;. In October 2010, it was listed at No. 18 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. Its three authors, John O&#x27;Donnell, Toby Creswell, and Craig Mathieson, praised &quot;the immense power of [Archer&#x27;s] bass and [Falconer&#x27;s] drums set against Seymour&#x27;s inventive guitar playing ... the songs were still esoteric , the massive bottom end made [them] an increasingly popular band around the pubs&quot;.

<text>Jacobus Houbraken (25 December 1698 – 14 November 1780) was a Dutch engraver and the son of the artist and biographer Arnold Houbraken (1660–1719), whom he assisted in producing a published record of the lives of artists from the Dutch Golden Age.

== Biography ==
Jacobus was born in Dordrecht, and learned the art of engraving from his father. In 1707, he moved to Amsterdam, where for years he helped his father with his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, his art historical work &quot;The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters&quot; (1718–1721). When his father died he assisted his mother with the last proofs of the manuscript before publishing. With this project he started his portraits of Netherlandish celebrities, that are today in many cases the &quot;only&quot; likenesses left of these people. He was influenced by studying the works of Cornelis Cort, Jonas Suyderhoef, Gerard Edelinck and the Visschers. He died, aged 81, in Amsterdam.

== Works ==
Houbraken devoted himself almost entirely to portraiture. His work became famous through his collaboration with the historian Thomas Birch and artist George Vertue, on the project entitled, &quot;Heads of Illustrious Persons of Great Britain&quot;, published in parts in London from 1743 to 1752. After that, during the years 1752–59 he worked with the historian Jan Wagenaar (1709–1773) on his 21 part &quot;Vaderlandsche historie&quot;, working for the publisher Isaac Tirion in Amsterdam. With this project of biographies of celebrated figures, he annotated his work with notes about the original paintings.

Among his best works are scenes from the comedy of &quot;De Ontdekte Schijndeugd&quot;, executed in his eightieth year, after Cornelis Troost, who was called by his countrymen the Dutch Hogarth. Houbraken also engraved the portraits for Jan van Gool&#x27;s &quot;Nieuwe schouburg der Nederlantsche kunstschilders&quot; (Den Haag, 1750–51).

== Legacy ==
His oeuvre of more than 400 portrait engravings form an important record for art provenance. His portraits were often set in an oval frame, with a subtitle with the subject&#x27;s claim to fame. Under that in small letters, he placed his notes about the original oil portrait. Some examples:

<doc id="854312" wikidata="Q506138" url="?curid=854312" title="Dan Piraro">
<text>Daniel Charles Piraro (born October 1958), is a painter, illustrator, and cartoonist best known for his syndicated cartoon panel &quot;Bizarro&quot;. Piraro&#x27;s cartoons have been reprinted in 16 book collections (as of 2012). He has also written three books of prose.

==Biography==
Piraro was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and his family moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma when he was 4 years old. When he was in junior high school his family moved to Tulsa, where he graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in 1976.

He dropped out of Washington University in St. Louis. He lived in Dallas and New York City for many years. He had two daughters with his first wife, and later married Ashley Lou Smith. After they divorced, he moved to Los Angeles, California. On October 30, 2016, he announced that he and his partner &#x27;Olive Oyl&#x27; (or &quot;O2&quot;) had purchased a house in Mexico and would be residing there beginning December 2016. Syndicated since 1985, &quot;Bizarro&quot; was appearing in 250 papers by 2006.

In 2014, he hosted the Fox reality television show &quot;Utopia&quot;.

Piraro has written a graphic novel, &quot;Peyote Cowboy,&quot; a story of magical realism in the Old West. He is posting it online as it is being illustrated.

==Political views==
Piraro describes himself as &quot;liberal and progressive politically&quot; and identifies as spiritual but non-religious.&quot;. His work has garnered occasional complaints, as in 2005 when he offered newspapers a politics-free version of a comic supporting gay rights. A glitch however meant that papers printing in color received the political version while those in black and white received its tamer counterpart.

In 2007, Piraro designed a limited edition T-shirt for endangeredwear.com to raise money for the Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit organization committed to ending the systematic abuse of animals used for food.

In a 2011 interview with This Land Press, Piraro discussed his challenges as a liberal growing up in Tulsa, OK.

==Awards==

Since 2001, Piraro has toured the U.S. with his one-man comedy show, &quot;The Bizarro Baloney Show&quot;, which won the 2002 New York International Fringe Festival&#x27;s award for Best Solo Show. He played the full show for the final time in 2008, although he has performed bits from the show a few times since then.

Piraro received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Panel Cartoon Award for 1999, 2000 and 2001. Beginning in 2002, Piraro was nominated every year for the National Cartoonists Society’s Reuben Award, as Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, and he finally was given a Reuben Award in 2010. Editorial cartoonist-illustrator Steve Greenberg commented:
His graphic novel, &quot;Peyote Cowboy,&quot; won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s &quot;Best Online Comic-Longform&quot; award in 2021.

<text>Gérard Edelinck (20 October 1640 (baptized) – 2 April 1707) was a copper-plate engraver and print publisher of Flemish origin, who worked in Paris from 1666 and became a naturalized French citizen in 1675.

==Life==
Edelinck was born in Antwerp, where he received his early training under the engravers Gaspar Huybrechts (1619–1684) and Cornelius Galle the Younger. He went to Paris in 1666, where he worked with his fellow Fleming Nicolas Pitau the elder. To improve himself further he subsequently studied under François de Poilly, Robert Nanteuil, and Philippe de Champaigne. These masters likewise had soon done all they could to help him onwards, and Edelinck ultimately took the first rank among line engravers.

His excellence was generally acknowledged; and having become known to Louis XIV he was appointed, on the recommendation of Le Brun, teacher at the academy established at the Gobelins manufactory for the training of workers in tapestry. He was also entrusted with the execution of several important works. In 1677 he won admission to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) with his &quot;Portrait of Philippe de Champaigne&quot;, engraved after a self-portrait.
==Work==

The work of this great engraver constitutes an epoch in the art. His prints number more than four hundred. Edelinck stands above and apart from his predecessors and contemporaries in that he excelled, not in some one respect, but in all respects, that while one engraver attained excellence in correct form, and another in rendering light and shade, and others in giving color to their prints and the texture of surfaces, he, as supreme master of the burin, possessed and displayed all these separate qualities, in so complete a harmony that the eye is not attracted by any one of them in particular, but rests in the satisfying whole.

Edelinck was especially good as an engraver of portraits, and executed prints of many of the most eminent persons of his time. Among these are those of Le Brun, Rigaud, Champaigne, Nanteuil, La Fontaine, Colbert, John Dryden, Descartes, Jean-Baptiste Lully, etc. He died at Paris in 1707. His younger brother Jean, and his son Nicholas, were also engravers.

==Works==
Among his most famous works are:
*&quot;Holy Family&quot;, after Raphael
*&quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot;, after Charles le Brun
*&quot;Alexander at the Tent of Darius&quot;, after Le Brun
*&quot;Combat of Four Knights&quot;, after Leonardo da Vinci
*&quot;Christ surrounded with Angels&quot;, after Le Brun
*&quot;St. Louis praying&quot;, after Le Brun
*&quot;St Charles Borromeo before a crucifix&quot;, after Le Brun

<text>The Mobro 4000 was a barge owned by MOBRO Marine, Inc. made infamous in 1987 for hauling the same load of trash along the east coast of North America from New York City to Belize and back until a way was found to dispose of the garbage. During this journey, local press often referred to the &quot;Mobro 4000&quot; as the &quot;Gar-barge&quot;.

== Voyage ==
In 1987, the City of New York found that it had reached its landfill capacity. The city agreed to ship its garbage to Morehead City, North Carolina, where there were plans to convert it into methane. On 22 March 1987, the tugboat &quot;Break of Day&quot; towed the barge &quot;Mobro 4000&quot; and its cargo of over 3,100 tons (2,812 tonnes) of trash. Chartered by entrepreneur Lowell Harrelson and Long Island mob boss Salvatore Avellino, it set sail on March 22 from Islip, New York, escorted by the tugboat &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; and carrying 3,168 tons (2,874 tonnes) of trash headed for a pilot program in Morehead City, North Carolina, to be turned into methane.

While it was in transit, a rumor spread that the 16 bundles of trash that contained hospital gowns, syringes and diapers was a contaminant that affected the entire load. The barge was docked at Morehead City, until a WRAL-TV news crew, acting on a tip, flew by helicopter to the coast to investigate. Action News 5 Reporter Susan Brozek broke the story on the 6 p.m. news on 1 April 1987, and North Carolina officials began their own investigation, which resulted in an order for the Mobro to move on.

As a result, the state of North Carolina refused to accept the waste. The barge then proceeded along the coast looking for another place to offload and continued to meet stiff resistance. After an 11-day delay, the &quot;Mobro&quot; made its way to its home port in Louisiana, but that state, too, declined the waste. Similarly, Alabama, three other states, and the nations of Mexico, Belize, and the Bahamas refused the load. The Mexican Navy denied it entrance to their waters. It made it as far south as Belize, again being rejected, before the operators abandoned the plan and returned to New York. 

Lowell Harrelson, the owner of the garbage, tried to negotiate for the &quot;Mobro&quot; to dock near Queens, whence the refuse would be carried back to Islip by trucks. Claire Shulman, the borough president of Queens, was not consulted, however; she obtained a temporary restraining order that forced the waste to stay at sea. The &quot;Mobro&quot; and its decaying cargo stayed off the shores of Brooklyn until July, when the vessel was granted a federal anchorage in New Jersey. The court hearings ran until October, when it was agreed that the cargo should be incinerated in Brooklyn. The 430 tons of ash that remained from this process was added to the landfill in Islip.

==Legacy==
At the time, the &quot;Mobro 4000&quot; incident was widely cited by environmentalists and the media as emblematic of the solid-waste disposal crisis in the United States due to a shortage of landfill space: almost 3,000 municipal landfills had closed between 1982 and 1987. It triggered much national public discussion about waste disposal, and may have been a factor in increased recycling rates in the late 1980s and after.

According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the &quot;Mobro 4000&quot; incident was caused by a combination of poor decision making by local Islip public officials and short-term difficulties triggered by changing environmental regulations.

==In popular culture==
A commemorative T-shirt was produced with the wording &quot;L.I. Garbage Barge - World Tour &#x27;87&quot; surrounding a cartoon image of the scow.

The Swedish 1988 comedy film &quot;S.O.S. – En segelsällskapsresa&quot; features a garbage barge as a plot device, roaming the inner Stockholm Archipelago.

The backstory of the garbage ball in the 1999 &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;A Big Piece of Garbage&quot;, draws directly from this event.

Singer Sally Timms included a song about the incident, &quot;Junk Barge&quot;, written by Dave Trumfio, in her 1995 album &quot;To the Land of Milk and Honey&quot;.

A children&#x27;s book about the incident, &quot;Here Comes the Garbage Barge&quot;, by Jonah Winter, was published in 2010. Another, &quot;All That Trash: The Story of the 1987 Garbage Barge and Our Problem with Stuff&quot;, by Meghan McCarthy, was published in 2018.

<doc id="854333" wikidata="Q370495" url="?curid=854333" title="Dahab">
<text>Dahab (, , &quot;gold&quot;) is a small Egyptian town on the southeast coast of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, approximately northeast of Sharm el-Sheikh.

Dahab can be divided into three major parts. Masbat, which includes the Bedouin village of Asalah, is in the north. South of Masbat is Mashraba, which is more touristic and has considerably more hotels. In the southwest is Medina which includes the Laguna area, famous for its excellent shallow-water kite- and windsurfing.

The region of Asalah is quite developed and has many campsites and hostels. Most people who have visited Dahab in the past are backpackers interested in diving and snorkeling in the Red Sea. The town of Dahab counts around 15,000 inhabitants.

Dahab is mentioned in Deuteronomy as דִ֥י זָהָֽב (&quot;dî zāhāḇ),&quot; and in the Septuagint translation as Καταχρύσεα. Gesenius exegetes as, &quot;“I have no doubt but that it is the same place as that now called Dehab on the western shore of the Ælanitic gulf, where there are many palms.”&quot;

Following the Six-Day War of 1967, Sinai was occupied by Israel and Dahab became known as Di-Zahav. The Sinai Peninsula was restored to Egyptian rule under the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty in 1982.

==Tourism==

Dahab attracts large numbers of tourists. It is world-renowned for its windsurfing. Reliable winds provide superb flat-water conditions inside Dahab&#x27;s sand spit. Further away from shore, wavy conditions couple with strong winds to provide formidable conditions for keen windsurfers. However, in recent years, the lagoon inside the sand spit has been overtaken by kitesurfers, with two Russian-owned schools opening right on the beach. Scuba diving, free-diving and snorkelling are also popular activities with many reefs immediately adjacent to waterfront hotels. The nearby Blue Hole (nicknamed &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Diving Site&quot;) and Canyon are internationally famous dive spots. The increasing destruction of coral by reckless divers is a pressing issue that is causing some worry, sparking the need to regulate dive centers more thoroughly.

Land-based activities include rock climbing, camel riding, horse riding, cycling, mountain biking trips, jeep and quad bike trips. Mount Sinai is a two-hour drive, with Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery being a popular tourist destination.
Historically, most visitors to Dahab have been backpackers traveling independently and staying in hostels, motels, or guesthouses in the Masbat area. In recent years, the development of hotels in the Medina area has facilitated the arrival of a wider range of tourists, many of whom visit Dahab specifically to partake in surfing, windsurfing, diving, kite surfing, sailing, and other activities.

The word &quot;Dahab&quot; is Arabic for gold and is possibly a reference to the geographic locality; gold washed down from the desert mountains may have accumulated on the alluvial flood plain where the town was built. The name may also be a reference to the color of the sands to the south of the town itself. Some locals attribute the name to the colour of the sky just after sunset.

One local story concerning the town&#x27;s name is that it stems from the floods that wash through the town every five or six years. Larger than average seasonal storms in the mountains cause a great rush of water to surge down to the sea, dragging with it great amounts of sand. During this time, the town is cut in two by the flood, the bay is stirred up and the sands turn it a golden yellow. This typically lasts a few days, and has caused damage and loss of life in the past as people were unaware of the sudden onset and the force the water moves at. Today, locals are ready when they see the clouds over the mountains.

According to the Bedouins of the area, however, the name &quot;Dahab&quot; has a different origin. When the Bedouin people came there they called it &quot;Waqaat Thahaab&quot; (وقت ذهب) which translates literally as &quot;Time Goes&quot;. This name derived from the fact that one could easily lose track of time when there, as the days would begin to run together. The name was then shortened to &quot;Thahaab&quot; (ذهب), but was misunderstood by travelers who thought they were saying Dahab.

Much of the coral in the reefs just offshore is slowly disappearing, due to inexperienced divers being taken out in large numbers. Another considerable problem is that in Masbat local restaurants are dumping sand and rock into the sea to extend the shoreline, again causing disruption to local coral reefs.

Local Bedouin children, sometimes encouraged by their families, come to beach cafes and restaurants to sell items such as woven bracelets to tourists.

== Natural and tourist attractions ==

The city has many of the most prominent attractions in Ras Abu Gallum, a nature reserve, and a diving area. It is one of the world&#x27;s most famous dive spots. The Kanoun region is one of the best diving areas in Al-Asala, a region where about 75% of the population of the city is divided into three areas (Mubarak City, Zarnouk, Al-Asala), Coral Island, and the remains of a historic fortress built by the Crusaders, Al-Mellil, a road parallel to the coast road, which includes some small hotels, cafeterias and houses, The main neighborhood of the city starts with Al Fanar Street and then Masbat Bay. It includes a wide range of shops, diving clubs, cafes, camps, and hotels. It includes a large number of cafeterias and diving centers. It also includes the only impact there is Tel Mashraba. It is located in the old city of Dahab. The area of Wadi Qani, an area that represents the future urban expansion of the city because it includes a wide range of hotels, service, and residential complexes, as well as the areas of Lighthouse and the Garden Garden and Oasis. Dahab comprises two gulfs, the Laguna or Ghazala, which is characterized by the city&#x27;s only sandy beach and the city&#x27;s cistern, as well as resorts along its shores that integrate with the surrounding nature with log-and-palm kiosks for tourists.

== Geography ==
=== Landscape ===
Dahab contains many mineral deposits, including rutile, zircon, monazite, leucoxene, and gold. Many of these are Neoproterozoic rocks such as schist. 

=== Climate ===
Dahab has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) as the rest of Egypt. The weather on summer days is very hot and also quite hot at night. Winter days are warm and nights are mild. Dahab has a very dry climate and rain is rare, even during the winter months. The precipitation peaks in February.

<text>&#x27; (provisional designation &#x27;) is a trans-Neptunian object and damocloid from the outer Solar System. Its orbit is retrograde and comet-like, and has a high eccentricity. It was discovered on 4 September 2002 by astronomers with the LONEOS survey at Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, in the United States. The unusual object measures approximately in diameter and is likely elongated in shape. It is a slow rotator and potentially a tumbler as well. The object was probably ejected from the ecliptic by Neptune.

== Orbit and classification ==
 is a member of the damocloids, with a retrograde orbit and a negative TJupiter of −0.8340. It is also a trans-Neptunian object, as its orbit has a semi-major axis larger than that of Neptune (30.1 AU). The Minor Planet Center lists it as a critical object, centaur, and (other) unusual minor planet due to an orbital eccentricity of more than 0.5.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.5–105 AU once every 396 years (semi-major axis of 53.92 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.95 and an inclination of 119° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Astrovirtel at ESO&#x27;s La Silla Observatory in February 2001, or 19 months prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.

== Numbering and naming ==
This minor planet was permanently numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 14 June 2003 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

== Physical characteristics ==
The object has a B–R magnitude of 1.37, typical for most dynamical groups in the outer Solar System.

=== Rotation period ===
In October 2010, a rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer René Roy . Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 200 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.6 magnitude, indicative of an elongated, non-spherical shape (). With a rotation period above 100 hours, it is a typical slow rotator.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey of minor-planet albedos of bodies in a comet-like orbit, carried out by Yanga Fernández in collaboration with David Jewitt and Scott Sheppard at the Institute for Astronomy, Hawaii, measures 14.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.098. Johnston&#x27;s archive gives a rounded figure of 15 kilometers.

<text>Cornelis Cort ( March 1578) was a Dutch engraver and draughtsman. He spent the last 12 years of his life in Italy, where he was known as &quot;Cornelio Fiammingo&quot;.

==Biography==

Born in Hoorn or Edam, Cort may have been a pupil of Dirck Volckertsz Coornhert in the 1550s in Haarlem. His first known engravings were published in Antwerp around 1553, though it is thought that he remained working in the Northern Netherlands. The publisher was Hieronymous Cock, under whom Cort may have apprenticed as well. A letter of 1567 from Dominicus Lampsonius to the artist Titian described Cock as Cort&#x27;s master. Plates, which Cort produced for Cock were inscribed with Cort&#x27;s name only after he left his apprenticeship with Cock.

Cort moved to Venice and lived in the house of Titian in 1565 and 1566. He produced engravings based on Titian&#x27;s works. Among these are the well-known copperplates of &quot;St Jerome in the Desert&quot;, the &quot;Magdalen&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot;, and &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;. From Italy he wandered back to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567, proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced engravings from all the great masters of the time.

In Rome he founded the well-known school in which, as Bartsch tells us, the simple line of Marcantonio was modified by a brilliant touch of the burin, afterwards imitated and perfected by Agostino Carracci in Italy and Nicolaes de Bruyn in the Netherlands. Before visiting Italy, Cort had been content to copy Michael Coxcie, Frans Floris, Heemskerk, Gillis Mostaert, Bartholomeus Spranger and Stradanus. In Italy he gave circulation to the works of Raphael, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Baroccio, Giulio Clovio, Muziano and the Zuccari.

Cort visited Florence between 1569 and 1571 probably working for the Medici family. He returned to Titian in Venice in 1571-1572. He spent the last year of his life in Rome, where he died. His connection with Cock and Titian is pleasantly illustrated in a letter addressed to the latter by Dominick Lampson of Liège in 1567. Cort is said to have engraved upwards of one hundred and fifty-one plates.

The art collector George Cumberland wrote in 1827 that

<text>Reddiar (also spelt as Reddiyar) is a Telugu speaking land owning, merchants, agricultural social group in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.

Reddiars, Reddy, Reddappa are considered and believed to come from the same origins and they spread across the lands of Southern and Central India. They are the patrons/financial supporters of local temples in Tamil Region. The names have been believed to be derived according to the regions they are spread across. Reddy in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Reddiar (Reddy + ar) in Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, and Kerala. Reddy, Reddappa (Reddy + appa- signifying respect) in Karnataka.

Many Reddiars moved from the Andhra region in search of rich soil for cultivation and settled in Pondicherry and the northern districts of Cuddalore, Villupuram and Chengalpet in Tamil Nadu during Vijayanagar Empire.

The migration of the Reddys/Reddiars to Tamil Nadu is assumed to have occurred during the Reddy dynasty expansion till Kanchipuram areas.

Following are the districts that have significant Reddiar Population.
Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Ranipet, Vellore, Thirupattur, Thiruvannamalai, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Puducherry, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Salem, Erode, Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Karur, Perambalur, Tiruchirappalli, Dindigul, Madurai,
Virudhunagar, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli.

==Origins==

Anavota Reddy (1335-1364 CE) of Reddy dynasty extended the dominion of the kingdom to Rajahmundry on the north, Kanchi on the south and Srisailam on the west. In a battle at Vallioor, Reddiapuram army defeated Travancore army in the 14th century. In an information Board at the entrance of the Vallioor Murugan Temple it is stated that 14th century Vallioor War - Reddiapuram army defeated Travancore Army at vallioor Battle. After this war Reddiars settled at Samugarengapuram, Seelathikulam and all over Tirunelveli Region in the 14th century.

A mural at the Tiruppudaimaruthur temple in Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu, shows the emissaries of the Vijayanagara king Achyutadeva Raya serving an ultimatum to the Travancore ruler Bhoothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varma to pay tributes to him and return the Pandya territory to Sri Vallabhan. It also depicts the battle between the armies of Achyutadeva Raya and Bhoothala Varma.They are believed moved into Tamil Nadu with the Vijayanagara Emperor Kumara Kampana to liberate Madurai [Madura Vijayam] from Islamic rule and expansion of Vijayanagar empire along with other Telugu and Kannada origin social groups.

==Diaspora==

Through emigration, there are now many Reddiars in the United States, South Africa, Singapore, Australia and United Kingdom. Many were brought to South Africa during British colonial era to work on the sugarcane farms as indentured labourers. The descendants of such Reddiars can still be found in South Africa today.

==Reddy versus Reddiars==

Reddys predominantly speak Telugu and follow Telugu cultural norms like Ugadi, Dussehra and Sankranthi and follow all other Andhra norms, whereas Reddiars who came from Andhra to the Tamil region speak both Tamil and Telugu, and follow both Tamil and Telugu cultural norms. They also celebrate Thai Pongal, Tamil New Year and Ugadi. Some have represented in Tamil literary circles as great patrons and scholars of Tamil language.

<text>Jeanette Biedermann (born Jean Biedermann, 22 February 1980) is a German singer, actress, and television personality. Born and raised in the greater Berlin area, Biedermann began performing as a member of a troupe of acrobats in a children&#x27;s circus at the age of six. She later attended beauty school before dropping out to pursue her music career following her participation and win of the &quot;Bild&quot;-Schlagerwettbewerb competition in 1998. The following year, Biedermann placed fourth in the national final for the Eurovision Song Contest and was propelled to stardom when she was cast in a main role in the soap opera &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot;. In 2000, she made her musical breakthrough with her first two full English-language albums &quot;Enjoy!&quot; (2000) and &quot;Delicious&quot; (2001).

Trying to reinvent her image, Biedermann shifted to pop rock music for her next albums – &quot;Rock My Life&quot; (2002), &quot;Break On Through&quot; (2003) and &quot;Naked Truth&quot; (2006). Following her departure from &quot;GZSZ&quot; and a longer hiatus, she had a starring role in the telenovela &quot;Anna und die Liebe&quot; and released her dance pop-led album &quot;Undress to the Beat&quot; (2009), which was less successful commercially and led to a decline in her musical career. In 2012, Biedermann became the lead singer of the German-language group Ewig which eventually disbanded in 2019. The same year, she appeared in the sixth season of &quot;Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of the &quot;Best Singers&quot; series and announced the release of her eighth solo effort &quot;DNA&quot; (2019).

Lending her musical knowledge to others, Biedermann served as a member of the judging panel of reality television competition series such as &quot;Star Search&quot; and &quot;Stars auf Ice&quot; in 2003 and 2006, respectively. Since then, she has also starred in various films, theatrical projects and television shows, including crime series &quot;Tatort&quot; (2006) and spoofing film &quot;Dörte&#x27;s Dancing&quot; (2008). With album and single sales in excess of ten million copies, Biedermann is ranked among the highest-selling German music artists to emerge in the early 2000s. Her contributions to the music industry have garnered her numerous achievements including two ECHO Awards, a Goldene Kamera and a &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; Award.

== Early life ==
Biedermann was born in Bernau bei Berlin on 22 February 1980 as the only child of Bernd and Marion Biedermann. Before Jeanette was born, her parents lost three children. Two children were lost during their pregnancies! the third child, Dennis, died three weeks after birth. At the age of six she began performing professionally on stage of the &quot;Circus Lilliput&quot;, appearing as a member of a troupe of acrobats and she went on to attend beauty school once she graduated from high school. After her secondary school graduation, she started receiving vocational training as a hairdresser. The singer discontinued her studies in 1999, however, after she participated in and won the &quot;Bild-Schlagerwettbewerb&quot; competition, winning out over 270,000 other contestants. She released her debut single, &quot;Das tut unheimlich weh&quot;, soon after that. To date, it remains her only song performed entirely in German.

One month later, after the competition, she continued becoming an actress when she appeared on the German soap opera &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot;, where she played the role of Marie Balzer from 1999 to 2004.
Biedermann&#x27;s blossoming TV career only boosted her music career. In May 2008, she has played the main role of Anna Polauke with German actor in the new TV series &quot;Anna und die Liebe&quot; aired in August 2008, which has brought her further success within Germany. The series broke many records with more than 2.5 million people watching Anna und die Liebe. In October 2009, Jeanette confirmed that she will leave Anna und die Liebe in January 2010. The last episode with her aired in April 2010; she focused on her music career and going on Tour.

== Career ==
=== 2000–2001: Success career: &quot;Enjoy&quot; and &quot;Delicious&quot; ===
Her second album, &quot;Delicious&quot;, came out soon after her debut album, and it became her first album which was certified Gold in Germany.

A few months later after her debut on &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot;, she signed a music contract with Polydor and recorded her first album. In September 2000 she released her first English speaking single &quot;Go Back&quot; which became the first single of Biedermann&#x27;s debut album &quot;Enjoy&quot;. The album peaked at number 39 in the national album charts and in Switzerland at number 67. Biedermann won an ECHO in 2001 for best-selling &quot;Female Artist National&quot; one year later.

=== 2002–2003: &quot;Rock My Life&quot; and &quot;Break On Through&quot; ===

Trying to distance herself from her dance pop image, Biedermann reinvented her musical direction by developing a more rock pop-oriented sound with her third album, &quot;Rock My Life&quot; (2002). Upon its release, the album peaked at number seven on the German Albums Chart and was eventually certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). Its same-titled lead single became her first top five hit, reaching number three on the German Singles Chart, and peaked at number six in Austria. &quot;Rock My Life&quot; spawned three further top ten singles, including &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot;, &quot;Right Now&quot; and a cover version of Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot;, a duet with Boyzone member Ronan Keating that was initially recorded for his second album &quot;Destination&quot; (2002). Afterwards Biedermann started her second live tour, the Rock My Life Tour. It sold over 130,000 tickets and became a sellout.

The following year, Biedermann announced her departure from &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; and served as a coach on the debut season of the Sat.1 talent series &quot;Star Search&quot;. In November, her fourth studio album &quot;Break On Through&quot; was released. Taking her work further into the rock genre, it became her first top ten album in Austria and Switzerland as well as her highest-charting album to date in Germany, peaking at number six. With sales in excess of 200,000, it reached platinum status in Germany and was certified gold by the Austrian International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). &quot;Rockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Floor&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, became a top ten hit all over German-speaking Europe and was followed by two further singles, &quot;No Eternity&quot; and &quot;Hold the Line&quot;. The same year, Biedermann embarked on her Break On Through Tour, a 45-city tour throughout Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, and played a fictionalized version of herself in the television action film &quot;&quot; alongside Ralf Moeller and Katy Karrenbauer.

=== 2004–2006: &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; and &quot;Naked Truth&quot; ===
In 2004, Biedermann played a dancer opposite Jan Sosniok in the Sat.1 television film &quot;Liebe ohne Rückfahrschein&quot;. The romantic comedy was broadcast to mixed reviews and high ratings. Biedermann recorded several original songs as well as cover versions of Christmas standards and carols for her fifth studio album and first Christmas record, &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. Released in November 2004, the album debuted at number 22 in the German Albums Chart. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Infant Light&quot;, peaked at number eleven on the German Singles Chart.

&quot;Naked Truth&quot; was released in March 2006 and included contributions from her then boyfriend and guitarist Jörg Weissenberg. The album reached a moderate number 14 on the national albums chart but then fell quickly out of the Top 50. In Austrian the album reached number 44 and in Switzerland number 55. The singles charted within the Top 20. The third single Heat of Summer peaked at number 50 in the German singles Charts. It was promoted by a short live tour, entitled &quot;Bad Girls Club&quot;, hitting eight cities throughout Germany. After the tour she decided to take a break from her music career and want focus on her acting career but will coming back anytime to make music. During the Tour she Datet Jorg Weisselberg.

=== 2008–2017: Comeback with &quot;Undress to the Beat&quot; and solo career retirement ===

In 2009, Biedermann released her seventh studio album &quot;Undress to the Beat&quot;. Trying to reinvent her image once again, she shifted to electronic pop music for the overall sound of the record and consulted a number of new and upcoming collaborators to work with her, including Scandinavian musicians such as Remee, Carl Falk, Thomas Troelsen and Johan Bobäck. Upon its release, &quot;Undress to the Beat&quot; debuted and peaked at number 13 on the German Albums Chart, also reaching the top 30 in Austria, and became her highest-charting album since &quot;Break on Through&quot; (2003). Its release was preceded by the same-titled lead single, produced by Bobäck, which peaked at number six in Germany, becoming her eleventh top ten single. &quot;Undress to the Beat&quot; spawned two further singles, including &quot;Material Boy (Don&#x27;t Look Back)&quot; and &quot;Solitary Rose&quot;, the latter of which she performed on &quot;Anna und die Liebe&quot; and was a top 20 hit in Austria and Germany. In early 2010, Biedermann announced her departure from &quot;Anna und die Liebe&quot; in March 2010 since she was preparing for her Solitary Rose Tour, set to start in April 2010. However, the tour was eventually cancelled in late March 2010 due to her father&#x27;s pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Following her father&#x27;s remission, Biedermann resigned with &quot;Anna und die Liebe&quot; for its third and fourth season in fall 2010.

In 2011, German fashion retailer Jeans Fritz engaged Biedermann as a designer and model for their casual brand. The same year, she appeared in the historical television thriller &quot;&quot;. Filmed in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest, it was broadcast to positive reviews and high ratings. In August 2011, Biedermann was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for her social, charitable or philanthropic work as a German Red Cross ambassador. Feeling increasingly exhausted due to her time-consuming career in both music and film, Biedermann decided to withdraw from her public life as a solo artist and founded the band Ewig along with boyfriend Jörg Weißelberg and friend Christian Bömkes. Taking her back to her career beginnings, the band released two German language studio albums, &quot;Wir sind Ewig&quot; and &quot;Indianerehrenwort&quot;, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, with both of them reaching the top 50 of the German Albums Chart. In 2015, Ewig represented Brandenburg in the Bundesvision Song Contest with the song &quot;Ein Geschenk&quot;, finishing in eighth place.

=== 2018–present: Solo career revival ===
In April 2019, Ewig announced their disbandment following the departure of band member Christian Bömke. On 16 April 2019, Biedermann released &quot;Wie ein offenes Buch&quot;, her first solo single in ten years, through Columbia Records. The following month, she participated in the sixth season of the reality television series &quot;Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert&quot;, the German version of the series &quot;The Best Singers&quot;. Her appearance on the show was accompanied by the release of another single, &quot;Deine Geschichten&quot;, as well as the announcement of her seventh studio album &quot;DNA&quot; which was released on 6 September 2019.

== Personal life ==
In early 2005, Biedermann dated Jörg Weisselberg, the guitarist of her band. In July 2008, they broke up, stating their lack of time spent together and the stress of a long-distance relationship. Biedermann said they would be friends and would be working together as such. There were some rumors that they were still together (or together again), as they were seen going out together. Two years later, they are together and engaged, as the German press reports. In summer 2012, the couple married.

<text>Maarten van Heemskerck (born Maerten Jacobsz van Veen; 1 June 1498 – 1 October 1574), also known as Marten Jacobsz Heemskerk van Veen, was a Dutch portrait and religious painter, who spent most of his career in Haarlem. He was a pupil of Jan van Scorel, and adopted his teacher&#x27;s Italian-influenced style. He spent the years 1532–36 in Italy. He produced many designs for engravers, and is especially known for his depictions of the Wonders of the World.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Heemskerck was born in the village of Heemskerk, North Holland, halfway between Alkmaar and Haarlem. He was the son of a farmer called Jacob Willemsz. van Veen, later buried in the village churchyard. According to his biography by Karel van Mander, he began his artistic training with the painter Cornelius Willemsz in Haarlem, but was recalled to Heemskerk by his father to work on the family farm. However, having contrived an argument with his father he left again, this time for Delft, where he studied under Jan Lucasz, before moving on to Haarlem, where he became a pupil of Jan van Scorel, learning to paint in his teacher&#x27;s innovative Italian-influenced style.

Heemskerck then went to lodge at the home of the wealthy curate of the Sint-Bavokerk, Pieter Jan Foppesz (whose name van Mander writes as Pieter Ian Fopsen). They knew each other because Foppesz owned land in Heemskerk. The artist painted him in a now famous family portrait, considered the first of its kind in a long line of Dutch family paintings. His other works for Foppesz included two life size figures symbolising the Sun and the Moon on a bedstead, and a picture of Adam and Eve &quot;rather smaller but (it is said) after living models&quot;. His next home was in the house of a goldsmith, Justus Cornelisz, on the edge of Haarlem.

Before setting off for Italy on a Grand Tour in 1532, Heemskerck painted a scene of St. Luke painting the Virgin for the altar of St. Luke in the Bavokerk. An inscription, incorporated into a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; label on the painting begins &quot;This picture is a remembrance from its painter, Marten Heemskerck; he has here dedicated his labours to St Luke as a proof of regard to his associates in his profession, of which that saint is patron&quot;.

===Italy===
He travelled around the whole of northern and central Italy, stopping at Rome, where he had letters of introduction from van Scorel to the influential Dutch cardinal William of Enckenvoirt.

It is evident of the facility with which he acquired the rapid execution of a scene-painter that he was selected to collaborate with Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, Battista Franco and Francesco de&#x27; Rossi (Il Salviati) on the redecoration of the Porta San Sebastiano at Rome as a triumphal arch (5 April 1536) in honour of Charles V. Giorgio Vasari, who saw the battle-pieces which Heemskerk then produced, said they were well composed and boldly executed.

While in Rome where he made numerous drawings of classical sculpture and architecture, many of which survive in two sketchbooks now in the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin. He was to use them as source material throughout the rest of his career. Among these are the Capitoline Brutus, van Heemskerck being the first known artist to make a sketch of this now famous bust.

A hypothesis put forward in 2021 and explained in 2024 stating that the drawings in the two Berlin scrapbooks were not executed by Maarten van Heemskerck and the Anonimi A and B, but with a few exceptions entirely by the sculptor Cornelis Floris II and dated between 1535/36 and 1538, was not taken up by archaeological and art-historical research and was refuted by several contributions to the Berlin exhibition catalog “The Allure of Rome. Maarten van Heemskerck draws the city.&quot;

Not only the provenance history of the Roman sketchbook, but above all stylistic and handwritten comparisons confirm Van Heemskerck&#x27;s authorship. In addition, Van Heemskerck often reused Roman motifs from his drawings in later works, which would not have been possible if Cornelis Floris, who worked in Antwerp, had been the author. The results of the art technological examination of 2024 also contradict the hypothesis, as the ink of the drawings in the Roman sketchbook has the same composition as the undoubtedly autograph sheets of larger format, some of which are signed and dated.

===Later career===
On his return to the Netherlands in 1536, he settled back at Haarlem, where he became president of the Haarlem Guild of Saint Luke (in 1540), married twice (his first wife and child died during childbirth), and secured a large and lucrative practice.

The alteration in his style, brought about by his experience of Italy was not universally admired. According to van Mander, &quot;in the opinion of some of the best judges he had not improved it, except in one particular, that his outline was more graceful than before&quot;.

He painted large altarpieces for his friend, the art maecenas and later Catholic martyr of the Protestant Reformation, Cornelis Muys (also known as &quot;Musius&quot;). Muys had returned from a period in France to the Netherlands in 1538 and became prior of the St. Agatha cloister in Delft (later became the Prinsenhof). This lucrative and high-profile work in Delft earned Heemskerck a commission for an altarpiece in the Nieuwe Kerk (Delft) for their Guild of St. Luke. In 1553 he became curate of the Sint-Bavokerk, where he served for 22 years (until the Protestant reformation). In 1572 he left Haarlem for Amsterdam, to avoid the siege of Haarlem which the Spaniards laid to the place.

==Engravings==
He was one of the first Netherlandish artists to make drawings specifically for reproduction by commercial printmakers. He employed a technique incorporating cross-hatching and stippling, intended to aid the engraver.


===Wonders of the World===
Heemskerck produced designs for a set of engravings, showing eight, rather than the usual seven wonders of the ancient world. His addition to the conventional list was the Colosseum in Rome, which, unlike the others, he showed in ruins, as it was in his own time, with the speculative addition of a giant statue of Jupiter in the centre. They were engraved by Philip Galle and published in 1572. 
==Paintings==


Many works by van Heemskerck survive. &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; and &quot;St. Luke painting the Likeness of the Virgin and Child&quot; in presence of a poet crowned with ivy leaves, and a parrot in a cage – an altar-piece in the gallery of Haarlem, and the &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; in the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, are characteristic works of the period preceding van Heemskerck&#x27;s visit to Italy. An altar-piece executed for the St. Laurence Church of Alkmaar in 1539–1543, composed of at least a dozen large panels, which including portraits of historical figures, preserved in Linköping Cathedral, Sweden since the Reformation, shows his style after his return from Italy.

He painted a crucifixion for the Riches Claires at Ghent (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent) in 1543, and an altar-piece for the Drapers&#x27; Company at Haarlem, finished in 1546 and now in the gallery of the Hague. They show how Heemskerck studied and repeated the forms which he had seen in the works of Michelangelo and Raphael at Rome, and in the frescoes of Andrea Mantegna and Giulio Romano in Lombardy, but he never forgot his Dutch origin or the models first presented to him by Scorel and Jan Mabuse.

In 1550, Heemskerck painted a large, now dismembered triptych, the remains of which are today divided between the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg (&quot;Adam and Eve/Gideon and the Fleece&quot;), and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (&quot;The Visitation&quot;). As late as 1551, he then produced a copy from Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of Loreto&quot; (Frans Hals Museum). In 1552, he painted a view of a bull race inside the Colosseum of Rome (Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille). A &quot;Judgment of Momus&quot;, dated 1561, in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, shows that he was well acquainted with anatomy and fond of florid architecture. Two altar-pieces which he finished for churches at Delft in 1551 and 1559, one complete (&quot;St. Luke painting the Virgin&quot;), the other a fragment, in the museum of Haarlem, a third of 1551 in the Brussels Museum, representing Golgotha, the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, the &quot;Flight into Egypt&quot;, &quot;Christ on the Mount&quot;, and scenes from the lives of St. Bernard and St. Benedict, are all fairly representative of his style.

There is a &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the Hermitage Museum of Saint Petersburg, and two &quot;Triumphs of Silenus&quot; in the gallery of Vienna. Other pieces of varying importance are in the galleries of Rotterdam, Munich, Cassel, Brunswick, Karlsruhe, Mainz, Copenhagen, Strasbourg and Rennes.

===Parrots===

In his depiction of &quot;Saint Luke painting the Virgin&quot;, which Heemskerck painted twice for two painter&#x27;s guilds, there is some confusion in the literature about a parrot. In both paintings he painted a parrot, but the parrot in a cage has been sawn off the first painting and is no longer visible.

==Death==
In Amsterdam he made a will, which has been preserved. It shows that he had lived long enough and prosperously enough to make a fortune. At his death, he left money and land in trust to the orphanage of Haarlem, with interest to be paid yearly to any couple who should be willing to perform the marriage ceremony on the slab of his tomb in the cathedral of Haarlem. It was a superstition in Catholic Holland that a marriage so celebrated would secure the peace of the dead within the tomb.

==Reputation==
Heemskerck was widely respected in his own lifetime and was a strong influence on the painters of Haarlem in particular. He is known (along with his teacher Jan van Scorel) for his introduction of Italian art to the Northern Netherlands, especially for his series on the wonders of the world, that were subsequently spread as prints. Karel van Mander devoted six pages to his biography in his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;.

<doc id="854367" wikidata="Q7736458" url="?curid=854367" title="The Ginger Man">
<text>The Ginger Man is a novel, first published in Paris in 1955, by J. P. Donleavy. The story is set in Dublin, Ireland, in post-war 1947. It has become a major commercial success, selling over 45million copies worldwide. It was named one of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century by the Modern Library in 1998.

== Plot summary ==
The novel follows a wealthy disaffected American student, Sebastian Dangerfield, during his time studying law at Trinity College. The book chronicles Dangerfield&#x27;s violent and sexual misadventures and troubled relationship with his English wife and daughter.

==Background==
Donleavy&#x27;s friend and fellow writer Brendan Behan was the first person to read the completed manuscript. The book was rejected by numerous publishers, but &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; published some extracts from it, calling the book a &quot;comic triumph&quot;. Subsequently, Behan told Donleavy about Olympia Press, a Paris-based English-language publisher that had produced works by Samuel Beckett, and Donleavy succeeded in getting the book published by them, but was angered when he discovered that it had done so under its pornography imprint.

In his 1994 autobiography &quot;The History of The Ginger Man&quot;, Donleavy wrote, &quot;I smashed my fist upon its green cover format, published as it was in the pseudonymous and pornographic Traveller&#x27;s Companion Series, and I declared aloud, &#x27;If it&#x27;s the last thing I ever do, I will avenge this book.&#x27;&quot; Donleavy and the owner of Olympia Press, Maurice Girodias, became embroiled in decades of legal cases, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noting: &quot;Twenty years later, the two parties were still suing each other, under the guise of phantom companies – Donleavy was &#x27;The Little Someone Corporation&#x27; – with no end in sight. Girodias had declared himself bankrupt, and was preparing to buy back the title of his beloved Olympia Press at an auction in Paris. Donleavy learned of the sale and sent his wife to France with a large sum in cash. When bidding went over $8,000, Girodias ran out of money. The mysterious woman (as Girodias saw her) made a final bid, and the Olympia Press belonged to Donleavy.&quot;

==Reception==

Upon its publication, it was initially banned both in Ireland and the United States of America by reason of obscenity.

&quot;The Ginger Man&quot; has sold 45 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print. It was named one of the 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century by the Modern Library in 1998. The book was reprinted in 2001, and republished on by Grove Press.

In 1958, Norman Podhoretz, the editor of &quot;Commentary&quot;, noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, &quot;In recent months a large number of remarkably accomplished first novels by Americans have appeared, all of them bearing the usual exclamations of enthusiasm from the publishers on their dust jackets. What is most surprising, some of them – notably William Humphrey&#x27;s &quot;Home From the Hill&quot; and J. P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; – justify the excitement. […] What really makes &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; a vital work is the fact that it both reflects and comments dramatically on the absurdities of an age clinging to values in which it simply cannot believe and unable to summon up the courage to find out what its moral convictions really are&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2004, James Campbell judged that, &quot;&quot;The Ginger Man&quot; still reads well today, once one becomes accustomed to its headlong rush of style, its frequent verbless sentences, the switch of tenses and the manic swing between first and third persons as it lunges to catch the protagonist&#x27;s babbling thoughts […] In other places, the prose hops along alliteratively, with hints of Joyce and Dylan Thomas. Many chapters end with a snatch of verse, a habit that began in Donleavy&#x27;s first book and became his signature tune&quot;.

In the 2010 reissue of &quot;The Ginger Man&quot;, Jay McInerney noted in the introduction that the book &quot;has undoubtedly launched thousands of benders, but it has also inspired scores of writers with its vivid and visceral narrative voice and the sheer poetry of its prose&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Donleavy wrote a stage adaptation of &quot;The Ginger Man&quot;, directed by Philip Wiseman, which opened in London in September 1959, with Richard Harris playing Dangerfield. In October, the play opened in Dublin, also starring Harris, and was closed after three performances, owing to the play&#x27;s offensiveness (according to the Dublin critics), and following protests from the Catholic Church. All this is recorded by Donleavy in the 1961 Random House publication of the play with an essay by Donleavy, &quot;What They Did in Dublin with The Ginger Man (a play)&quot;.

The BBC produced a 90-minute made-for-television version of the play, directed by Peter Dews, and aired on 23 March 1962 in the United Kingdom. Ann Bell played Marion Dangerfield, Ronald Fraser as Kenneth O&#x27;Keefe, Ian Hendry as Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield, and Margaret Tyzack was Miss Frost.

Donleavy asked director George Roy Hill to film the novel (the two of them, along with Gainor Crist, had been at Trinity together), but Hill felt that he would lose perspective because the project would be too close to his heart and his time as a young man at Trinity.

In 2005 there was reportedly discussion with actor Johnny Depp about starring in a film based on the novel. Rumors of getting the project started surfaced every year or two since 1998, including Depp traveling to Dublin to work on a script with Donleavy, and Depp enlisting Shane MacGowan for a part, but it never seemed to get going. In 2006 it appeared things were taking shape, with Depp selecting a director, Laurence Dunmore (&quot;The Libertine&quot;). Apparently, interest waned with the success of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. Depp returned to Ireland to meet with Donleavy again in the summer of 2008. As recently as June 2009, Donleavy was still hopeful that Depp would start the project in earnest.

The book also inspired songs of the same name, the first recorded by Geoff Muldaur, Fritz Richmond, and John Sebastian on the 1964 Elektra &quot;The Blues Project&quot; (EKL-264). (However, the liner notes for this album indicate that the song was a tribute to Richmond.) A second was written and recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Brian Cadd and was released as the first single from his self-titled debut album, released in October 1972.

<text>The Book of Heroic Failures, written by Stephen Pile in 1979, is a book written in celebration of human inadequacy in all its forms. Entries include William McGonagall, a notoriously bad poet, and Teruo Nakamura, a soldier of the Imperial Japanese Army who fought for Japan in World War II until 1974.

The original edition included an application to become a member of the Not Terribly Good Club of Great Britain; however, this was taken out in later editions because the club received over 20,000 applications and closed in 1979 on the grounds that, &quot;Even as failures, we failed&quot; (but not before Pile himself had been expelled from it for publishing a bestseller). The American version of the book was misprinted by the publishers, who left out half the introduction. As a consequence, later versions of the book came out with an erratum slip longer than the entire introduction. In his second book, &quot;The Return of Heroic Failures&quot;, published in 1988, Stephen Pile reports that Taiwanese pirates were not aware of this and did not include the erratum slip. The second book was published in the USA under the title &quot;Cannibals in the Cafeteria&quot;.

The second book came out in Greece in 1992, despite the first book not being released in the country. In fact, this second book was named &quot;Η ΤΕΧΝΗ ΤΗΣ ΑΠΟΤΥΧΙΑΣ No1&quot; (The Art of Failure No. 1). A small erratum slip in the book itself explains that it was a mistake. In an interview with English Radio DJ Andrew Marshall, Pile said &quot;&quot;The Book&quot; is one of the least successful books ever issued in the USA, I don&#x27;t think it has reached double figures there as yet and long may that remain the case.&quot;

In 1999, Penguin made the decision to re-publish the book as part of their &quot;Penguin Readers&quot; series to encourage reading from a young age.

A third volume, &quot;The Ultimate Book of Heroic Failures&quot;, was published by Faber and Faber in 2011, and a selection from the first two volumes (the author&#x27;s last ever word on the subject of heroic failure) was published in 2012.

Meyers has continued to star in other films, such as &quot;Albert Nobbs&quot; in 2011.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships and family ===
For a year in the late 1990s, Meyers dated his &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; co-star, Toni Collette.

From 2004 until 2012, he was in a relationship with Reena Hammer when she was 17 years old and he was 27. Reena is the daughter of makeup artist Ruby Hammer.

On 20 November 2007, his mother, Mary Geraldine O&#x27;Keeffe, died at Mercy University Hospital, Cork, aged 51, following a short, undisclosed illness.

On 30 June 2011 it was reported that he was taken to hospital by ambulance after a suspected suicide attempt. In 2016, a second attempt was suspected when paramedics, responding to an emergency call, found him slumped on the floor. Anonymous sources variously claimed and denied that Meyers intended to take his own life.

During 2016, he married Mara Lane. Their son was born in December 2016. In September 2017, Lane revealed that she had miscarried a second child.

In 2022 he listed his Nichols Canyon home in Los Angeles for sale. It was reported that the home had previously been listed for sale and was made available as a rental property until 2012 when it was listed for $1.6 million and again in 2018 it was offered for $1.795 million. The 2022 listing has the home for sale at $1.85 million.

=== Issues with alcohol ===
In 2007, Meyers&#x27; representative confirmed that Meyers had entered an alcohol-treatment programme.

In November 2007, he was arrested at Dublin Airport for intoxication and disturbing the peace.

In 2009, he was detained in Paris by French police for allegedly assaulting an airport lounge employee while drunk.

In 2010, at John F. Kennedy International Airport, he verbally abused and used racist language against airline staff and officials, who had refused him access to the boarding area after he had become intoxicated in the first-class lounge. He was banned by United Airlines as a result.

His representative confirmed Meyers was receiving treatment again in 2010. In November 2011, he was ordered by a French court to pay restitution of €1,000 and was given a judgment of a suspended sentence for public intoxication 24 months earlier.

After his wife suffered a miscarriage in 2017, Meyers relapsed at Dublin Airport.

In 2018, he broke his sobriety on a flight, resulting in a dispute with his wife at Los Angeles International Airport. In an interview with Larry King later that year, Meyers addressed the incident, stating &quot;... I shouldn&#x27;t drink. It doesn&#x27;t suit me and I had been sober for a long time.&quot; He insisted that he had learned his lesson and was sober again.

Meyers crashed his car in Malibu, California, in November 2020 and was subsequently charged with two drunk driving offences.

== Honours ==
On 5 October 2008, Meyers received an Honorary Patronage from the Trinity College Philosophical Society in Dublin.

In 2014, he was honoured at &quot;The Irish Post Awards&quot; by the presentation of the &quot;Legend Award&quot; for his contributions to the film and entertainment industry.

== Charity work ==
In February 2008, Meyers was named the ambassador for the Hope Foundation, a charity formed in his native Cork to support the street children of Calcutta.

He is also an ambassador for the Irish children’s charity Barretstown which supports children affected by serious illness. In 2019, he and fellow actor Aidan Gillen helped launch Barretstown&#x27;s new &quot;Press Play&quot; campaign which aimed to raise additional funds to serve more children and their families.

<doc id="854380" wikidata="Q346952" url="?curid=854380" title="Jan Gossaert">
<text>Jan Gossaert ( – 1 October 1532) was a French-speaking painter from the Low Countries also known as Jan Mabuse (the name he adopted from his birthplace, Maubeuge) or Jennyn van Hennegouwe (Hainaut), as he called himself when he matriculated in the Guild of Saint Luke, at Antwerp, in 1503. He was one of the first painters of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting to visit Italy and Rome, which he did in 1508–09, and a leader of the style known as Romanism, which brought elements of Italian Renaissance painting to the north, sometimes with a rather awkward effect. He achieved fame across at least northern Europe, and painted religious subjects, including large altarpieces, portraits and mythological subjects.

From at least 1508 he was apparently continuously employed, or at least retained, by quasi-royal patrons, mostly members of the extended Habsburg family, heirs to the Valois Duchy of Burgundy. These were Philip of Burgundy, Adolf of Burgundy, Christian II of Denmark when in exile, and Mencía de Mendoza, Countess of Nassau, third wife of Henry III of Nassau-Breda.

A contemporary of Albrecht Dürer and the younger Lucas van Leyden, whom he knew, he was less highly regarded in modern times than they were. As he was not a printmaker like these two artists, his works and fame did not spread as widely as theirs. His surviving drawings are excellent and are preferred by some to his paintings.

==Biography==

His name was in fact &quot;Jan Gossart&quot;, and he was so known in his lifetime; the Dutch version &quot;Gossaert&quot; crept into later sources, despite Gossart&#x27;s first language being French. Little is known of his early life. One of his earliest biographers, Karel van Mander, claimed he was from a small town in Artois or Henegouwen (County of Hainaut) called Maubeuge or &quot;Maubuse&quot;. Other scholars have determined he was the son of a bookbinder who received his training at Maubeuge Abbey, while the RKD mentions there is evidence to support a claim that he was born in Duurstede Castle. He is registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1503.

In 1508-9 he travelled to Rome, either in the company of, or later sent by, Philip of Burgundy, an illegitimate son of Duke Philip the Good, who was sent as ambassador to Pope Julius II by Philip the Handsome. Philip&#x27;s party, very likely including Gossaert, left the Netherlands in October 1508, arrived in Rome on 14 January 1509, and was back at The Hague by 28 June 1509. Although the details are unclear, it seems that Gossaert remained in Philip&#x27;s employment until he died in 1524, by then Bishop of Utrecht. However, throughout this time he was able to work for other patrons, mostly friends of Philip.

In 1509–17 Gossaert was registered as a resident of Middelburg. According to Van Mander he was one of the first Flemish artists to bring back the &quot;Italian manner&quot; of painting with much nudity in historical allegories. From 1517 to 1524 he is registered at Duurstede Castle where according to the RKD, he had Jan van Scorel as pupil. From 1524 onwards he returned to Middelburg as court painter to Adolf of Burgundy, another Habsburg relative. Jan Mertens the Younger was another pupil.

He was a contemporary of Lucas van Leyden, and was influenced by artists who came before him, such as Rogier van der Weyden, the great master of Tournai and Brussels and, like him, his compositions were usually framed in architectural backgrounds.

==Works==

Gossaert&#x27;s large altar-pieces previously located at Castle Howard and Scawby show the influence of the Antwerp school. At Scawby he illustrates the legend of the count of Toulouse, who parted with his worldly goods to assume the frock of a hermit. His altarpiece of the &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; with heavy double doors in Middelburg was admired by Albrecht Dürer before the church itself was hit by lightning. This is possibly the work now in the Hermitage, though Van Mander stated the lightning destroyed it and describes another &quot;Descent of the Cross&quot; in the possession of Mr. Magnus of Delft in 1604.

At Castle Howard, the Earl of Carlisle had obtained &quot;The Adoration of the Kings&quot; previously created for the Grandmontines, which throws together some thirty figures on an architectural background, varied in detail, massive in shape and fanciful in ornament. This painting is now on display at the National Gallery, which bought it in 1911. Gossaert surprises the viewer with pompous costume and flaring contrasts of tone. His figures, like pieces on a chess-board, are often rigid and conventional. The landscape which shows through the colonnades is adorned with towers and steeples in the minute fashion of Van der Weyden. After a residence of a few years at Antwerp, Gossaert took service with Philip of Burgundy, bastard of Philip the Good, at that time lord of Somerdyk and admiral of Zeeland. One of his pictures had already become celebrated: a &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; (50 figures), on the high altar of Tongerlo Abbey.
Philip of Burgundy ordered Gossaert to execute a replica for the church of Middelburg, and the value which was then set on the picture is apparent from the fact that Dürer came expressly to Middelburg (1521) to see it. In 1568 the altarpiece perished by fire. In 1508 Gossaert accompanied Philip of Burgundy on his Italian mission to the pope, and by this accident an important revolution was effected in the art of the Netherlands. Gossaert appears to have chiefly studied in Italy the cold and polished works of the Leonardesques. He not only brought home a new style, but he also introduced the fashion of travelling to Italy; and from that time until the age of Rubens and Van Dyck it was considered proper that all Flemish painters should visit the peninsula. The Flemings grafted Italian mannerisms on their own stock, and the cross turned out so unfortunately that for a century Flemish art lost all trace of originality.

Gossaert undoubtedly made a large number of drawings in Rome after the innumerable ancient ruins and sculptures that the city had. Today only four surviving magazines are known; a sheet with the ruins of the Colosseum (Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett), a study of the so-called Apollo Kitharoedos (Venice, Accademia), a study of the so-called Capitolean Hercules (Private collection, London), and a sheet with studies of, among others, the famous Spinario or &quot;thorn extractor&quot; (Leiden, Leiden University Library&#x27;s Print Room).

In the summer of 1509 Philip returned to the Netherlands, and, retiring to his seat of Suytburg in Zeeland, surrendered himself to the pleasures of planning decorations for his castle and ordering pictures of Gossaert and Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari. Being in constant communication with the court of Margaret of Austria at Mechelen, he gave the artists in his employ fair chances of promotion. Barbari was made court painter to the regent, while Gossaert received less important commissions. Records prove that Gossaert painted a (posthumous) portrait of Eleanor of Portugal, and other small pieces, for Charles V in 1516.
But his only signed pictures of this period are the &quot;Neptune and Amphitrite&quot; of 1516 at Berlin, and the &quot;Madonna&quot;, with a portrait of Jean Carondelet of 1517, at the Louvre, both of which suggest that Vasari only spoke by hearsay of the progress made by Gossaert in the true method of producing pictures full of mythological nude figures and poesies. It is difficult to find anything more coarse or misshapen than the Amphitrite, unless it is the grotesque and ungainly drayman who figures for Neptune. In later forms of the same subject—the Adam and Eve at Hampton Court, or its feebler replica at Berlin and &quot;Venus and Amor&quot; (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels)—there is more nudity, combined with realism of the commonest type.

Happily, Gossaert was capable of higher efforts. His St Luke painting the portrait of the Virgin in Sanct Veit at Prague, a variety of the same subject in the Belvedere at Vienna, the Madonna of the Baring collection in London, or the numerous repetitions of Christ and the scoffers (Ghent and Antwerp), all prove that travel had left many of Gossaert&#x27;s fundamental peculiarities unaltered. His figures still retain the character of stone; his architecture is as rich and varied, his tones are as strong as ever. But bright contrasts of gaudy tints are replaced by soberer greys; and a cold haze, the &quot;sfumato&quot; of the Milanese, pervades the surfaces. It is but seldom that these features fail to obtrude. When they least show, the master displays a brilliant palette combined with smooth surface and incisive outlines. In this form the Madonnas of Munich and Vienna (1527), the likeness of a girl weighing gold pieces (Berlin), and the portraits of the children of the king of Denmark at Hampton Court, are fair specimens of his skill.
As early as 1523, when Christian II of Denmark came to the Netherlands, he asked Gossaert to paint the likenesses of his dwarfs. In 1528 he requested the artist to furnish to Jean de Hare the design for his queen Isabellas tomb in the abbey of St Pierre near Ghent. It was no doubt at this time that Gossaert completed the portraits of John, Dorothy and Christine, children of Christian II, which came into the collection of Henry VIII. No doubt, also, these portraits are identical with those of three children at Hampton Court, which were long known and often copied as likenesses of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry and Princess Margaret of England. One of the copies at Wilton, inscribed with the forged name of Hans Holbein, ye father, and the false date of 1495, has often been cited as a proof that Gossaert came to England in the reign of Henry VII; but the statement rests on no foundation whatever.
At the period when these portraits were executed Gossaert lived at Middelburg. But he dwelt at intervals elsewhere. When Philip of Burgundy became bishop of Utrecht, and settled at Duurstede Castle, in 1517, he was accompanied by Gossaert, who helped to decorate the new palace of his master. At Philip&#x27;s death, in 1524, Gossaert designed and erected his tomb in the church of Wijk bij Duurstede. He finally retired to Middelburg, where he took service with Philip&#x27;s brother, Adolph, lord of Veeren.

Carel van Mander&#x27;s biography accuses Gossaert of an unruly life; yet it describes the solid education he must have had to learn his trade so well. It also describes the splendid appearance of Gossaert, dressed in gold brocade, as he accompanied Lucas van Leyden on a pleasure trip to Ghent, Mechelen and Antwerp in 1527.
The works of Gossaert are those of a hardworking and patient artist; the number of his still extant pictures practically demonstrates that he was not a debauchee. The marriage of his daughter with the painter Henry van der Heyden of Leuven suggests that he had a home, and did not live habitually in taverns. His death at Antwerp is recorded in the portrait engraved by Jerome Cock.

<doc id="854383" wikidata="Q309964" url="?curid=854383" title="MX (newspaper)">
<text>mX was an Australian free afternoon daily newspaper in the cities of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, owned and produced by News Corp Australia. Targeted at commuters, its main channels of distribution were inner-city railway stations, tram and bus stops, and major CBD intersections. The last edition of &quot;mX&quot; was published on 12 June 2015.

==Beginnings==
The first &quot;mX&quot; was published in Melbourne on 6 February 2001, hoping to capitalise on the Metro format, popular in Europe. The paper contained lighter news and sports articles, often containing strange stories and facts from around the world (under the headings &quot;Nice One&quot; and, &quot;What The?&quot;). The newspaper&#x27;s approach was to focus much more on entertainment than news, compared to broadsheet newspapers, or even other tabloids.

&quot;Melbourne Express&quot;, published by rival Fairfax Media, was this paper&#x27;s competitor. Initially it used the same format, although it was released in the mornings rather than the afternoon. It began publication the day before &quot;mX&quot;, but was soon overtaken due to &quot;mX&quot;&#x27;s much broader use of colour, its greater availability, and its lighter tone. In addition, &quot;mX&quot; had no explanation at its launch, allowing readers to assume that it stood for &quot;Melbourne Express&quot; and that it was the paper known by that name. &quot;Melbourne Express&quot; ceased publication on 7 September 2001.

The broad success of &quot;mX&quot; contributed to reduced sales of the afternoon edition of News Corporation stablemate the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, its last edition being published on 21 December 2001.

==Sydney and Brisbane editions==

Following the success of &quot;mX&quot; in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane editions were launched.

On 4 July 2005, &quot;mX&quot; launched a Sydney edition. Sydney City Council was considering a tender to lease Sydney footpaths to News Corporation for $362,000 annually, and charge other free daily newspaper a similar fee if they use the same location more than 40 times a year. Other newspapers, that are distributed by sellers on streets, are concerned about the possibility that they may be required to also pay such fees.

The Brisbane edition of &quot;mX&quot; was launched on 5 March 2007, with an expected distribution of 40,000 copies per day.

==Format and content==
Being a commuter newspaper, &quot;mX&quot; was much thinner than other daily newspapers.

Central themes of most articles included U.S. celebrity gossip, new product lines, controversial events, rumours, celebrity trivia, and readers&#x27; gripes, amongst other attention-grabbing stories. Large photographs often appeared without any related story, only a caption describing their contents; conversely, news stories were rarely accompanied by photographs. Small, large, and full page advertisements were also a major contributor to the paper&#x27;s overall make-up.

The newspaper launched an app in 2013.

==Sections==
* News – Short items of &quot;legitimate&quot; news such as national and state politics, included the next day&#x27;s weather forecast. Started on page 2.
* Juice – Celebrity gossip. Located on pages 4 and 5.
* Sport – Located on the final two or three pages.
* Brainwave – The puzzles page, including a crossword, Sudoku and various (Mumma needed) other word games. Also included a horoscope under the heading of &quot;Should I get out of bed tomorrow?&quot;
* Talk – Essentially Letters to the Editor, although most letters were very short, having been sent via SMS. It was divided into several sections:
** Vent Your Spleen – Devoted to readers&#x27; SMSed complaints (often about public transport services), comments and thoughts.
** Overheard – Devoted to humorous or bizarre conversations overheard and sent in by readers.
** Here&#x27;s Looking At You – In which readers wrote messages to people on public transport to whom they are attracted, in the hope that they will reply and arrange a date, or just to anonymously compliment them. Originally such messages appeared in the general &quot;Vent Your Spleen&quot; section, but the practice became so popular that it was separated into its own section. &quot;Here&#x27;s looking at all of you&quot; was the page-filling title page when the paper announced on 29 May 2015 its closure to the readers.
** Lost in Love – Readers&#x27; responses to a request from another reader for relationship advice, and an invitation to send replies to the next day&#x27;s question.
** My Platform – A vox pop in which three people on the street gave a short response to a question. This section has been dropped.
* Flicks – That night&#x27;s movie listings. A movie review used to feature in the middle of every flicks page but that was dropped in 2011 due to the space being needed for session time listings.
* The Box – Reviews of television programs screening that night.
* Program – That night&#x27;s primetime (6:00pm – midnight) television listing. Was combined with &quot;The Box&quot;.
* City Scene – A weekly entertainment section with an emphasis on all genres of popular music, including CD and movie reviews, concert listings, band interviews and trivia. Appears on Thursdays. Used to be called Citybeat.
* Goss &amp; Glam – Magazine-style entertainment and fashion news. Located on the middle four pages.
* Quickie – A short interview with a famous person. Dropped.
* CareerOne – Mainly job advertisements. Dropped.
* Flirt – A weekly section focused on love and relationships. Appeared on Fridays. Dropped.
* Weird – A two-page spread of weird news from around the world.
* Wanderlust – A two-page spread about travel destinations sponsored by Jetstar.

===Staples===
Some &quot;mX&quot; editions had been stapled, as they tended to remain contained and not blow around as much. This decision was also based on the capabilities of publishing equipment and whether binding systems were installed at the production facilities.

===Theming===
Occasionally the &quot;mX&quot; masthead was modified to capitalise on major events, such as a tennis ball and racquet during the Australian Open, and love hearts and using rose scented ink during Valentine&#x27;s Day. On the day of the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the x was changed to a Union Jack and many pages said &quot;The royal wedding&quot; other pages said &quot;Not the wedding&quot;. In the lead-up to both the 2007 federal election and 2010 federal election, the front page of each issue bore a &quot;disclaimer&quot; warning of the number of election stories (if any) contained within.
* St Patrick&#x27;s Day editions had the blue captions replaced with green, and Irish themed stories fill the &quot;Did You Know&quot; and &quot;What The?&quot; sections.
* Easter editions did not change colour; however, the &quot;Did You Know&quot; and &quot;What The?&quot; sections related to modern Easter stories (such as the world&#x27;s largest easter egg).

==Closure==

On 28 May 2015, News Corp announced that the newspaper was closing down. The final edition was printed on 12 June 2015, and the corresponding mobile app was also closed down.

==Revival==
In 2018 &quot;mX&quot; was briefly revived in Melbourne as part of a promotion by Carlton &amp; United Breweries. Published on four consecutive Wednesdays from 26 September, it was only available at Flinders Street, Flagstaff, Melbourne Central, Richmond and Southern Cross stations. The same stunt was pulled again in 2024, this time to promote the Rising arts festival. Two issues were distributed to 60,000 city workers at key train stations in the Melbourne central business district.

<doc id="854386" wikidata="Q2268151" url="?curid=854386" title="Wide Sargasso Sea">
<text>Wide Sargasso Sea is a 1966 novel by Dominican-British author Jean Rhys. The novel serves as a postcolonial and feminist prequel to Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847), describing the background to Mr. Rochester&#x27;s marriage from the point of view of his wife Antoinette Cosway, a Creole heiress. Antoinette Cosway is Rhys&#x27;s version of Brontë&#x27;s &quot;madwoman in the attic&quot;. Antoinette&#x27;s story is told from the time of her youth in Jamaica, to her unhappy marriage to an English gentleman, Mr. Rochester, who renames her Bertha, declares her mad, takes her to England, and isolates her from the rest of the world in his mansion. &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; explores the power of relationships between men and women and discusses the themes of race, Caribbean history, and assimilation as Antoinette is caught in a white, patriarchal society in which she fully belongs neither to Europe nor to Jamaica.

Rhys lived in obscurity after her previous work, &quot;Good Morning, Midnight&quot;, was published in 1939. She had published other novels between these works, but &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; caused a revival of interest in Rhys and her work and was her most commercially successful novel.

In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

==Plot==
The novel, initially set in Jamaica, opens a short while after the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834. The protagonist Antoinette relates the story of her life from childhood to her arranged marriage to an English gentleman, Mr. Rochester.

The novel is in three parts:

Part One takes place in Coulibri, a sugar plantation in Jamaica, and is narrated by Antoinette as a child. Formerly wealthy, since the abolition of slavery, the estate has become derelict and her family has been plunged into poverty. Antoinette&#x27;s widowed Martinique mother, Annette, must remarry to wealthy English gentleman Mr. Mason, who is hoping to exploit his new wife&#x27;s situation. Angry at the returning prosperity of the planter class, emancipated slaves living in Coulibri burn down Annette&#x27;s house, killing Antoinette&#x27;s mentally disabled younger brother, Pierre. As Annette had been struggling with her mental health up until this point, the grief of losing her son weakens her sanity. Mr. Mason sends her to live with a couple who torment her until she dies. When Antoinette visits her after the fire, Annette refuses to see or speak to her. Antoinette visits her mother once more when she is older but is alarmed at the abuse she witnesses by the servants to her mother and goes away without speaking to her.

Part Two alternates between the points of view of Antoinette and her husband during their honeymoon excursion to her mother&#x27;s summer estate Granbois, Dominica. Likely catalysts for Antoinette&#x27;s downfall are the mutual suspicions that develop between the couple, and the machinations of Daniel, who claims he is Antoinette&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother; he impugns Antoinette&#x27;s reputation and mental state and demands money to keep quiet. Antoinette&#x27;s old nurse Christophine openly distrusts Mr. Rochester. His apparent belief in the stories about Antoinette&#x27;s family and past aggravate the situation; her husband is unfaithful and emotionally abusive. He begins to call her Bertha rather than her real name and flaunts an affair in front of her to cause her pain. Antoinette&#x27;s increased sense of paranoia and the bitter disappointment of her failing marriage unbalance her already precarious mental and emotional state. She flees to the house of Christophine. Antoinette pleads with Christophine for an obeah potion to attempt to reignite her husband&#x27;s love, which Christophine reluctantly gives her. Antoinette returns home but the love potion acts like a poison on her husband. Subsequently he hardens his heart against reconciling with his wife and decides to take her away from Granbois out of spite.

Part Three is the shortest part of the novel; it is from the perspective of Antoinette, renamed by her husband as Bertha. Mr. Rochester&#x27;s father and brother have died, so he has returned to England with Antoinette to claim his sizeable inheritance. She is largely confined to &quot;the attic&quot; of Thornfield Hall, the mansion she calls the &quot;Great House&quot;. The story traces her relationship with Grace Poole, the servant who is tasked with guarding her, as well as her disintegrating life with Mr. Rochester, as he hides her from the world. He promises to come to her more but never does. Antoinette is thought mad by those who interact with her and has little understanding of how much time she has been confined. She dreams of freedom, when she remembers, and writes to her stepbrother Richard in Jamaica who, however, says he cannot &quot;interfere legally&quot; with her husband. Desperate and enraged, she attacks him with a knife bought in secret. She later forgets this encounter. Expressing her thoughts in stream of consciousness, Antoinette dreams of flames engulfing the house and her freedom from the life she has there, and believes it is her destiny to fulfill the vision. Waking from her dream she escapes her room, and sets out candle in hand.

==Themes==
===Postcolonialism===
Since the late 20th century, critics have considered &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; as a postcolonial response to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Rhys uses multiple voices (Antoinette&#x27;s, her husband&#x27;s, and Grace Poole&#x27;s) to tell the story, and intertwines her novel&#x27;s plot with that of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. In addition, Rhys makes a postcolonial argument when she ties Antoinette&#x27;s husband&#x27;s eventual rejection of Antoinette to her Creole heritage (a rejection shown to be critical to Antoinette&#x27;s descent into madness). 

=== Feminism ===
The novel is also considered a feminist work, as it deals with unequal power between men and women, particularly in marriage.

=== Slavery and ethnicity ===
Antoinette and her family were planters who owned slaves until the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act, which resulted in the family losing their wealth. They are pejoratively called &quot;white nigger&quot; or &quot;white cockroach&quot; by the island&#x27;s Black inhabitants because of their poverty and are openly despised, harassed, and assaulted. The villagers, inadvertently or not, kill Antoinette&#x27;s brother, setting fire to the home and seem poised to murder the rest of the family if not for the apparition of an ill omen - their dying green parrot. Meanwhile, Rochester looks down on Antoinette because of her status as a Creole. Scholar Lee Erwin describes this paradox through the scene in which Antoinette&#x27;s childhood home Coulibri is burned down and she runs to Tia, a black girl her own age, to &quot;be like her&quot;. Tia attacks Antoinette, throwing a rock at her head. Antoinette then says she sees Tia &quot;as if I saw myself. Like in a looking glass&quot;. Erwin argues that &quot;even as she claims to be seeing &quot;herself,&quot; she is simultaneously seeing &quot;the other&quot;, that which only defines the self by its separation from it, in this case literally by means of a cut. History here, in the person of a former slave&#x27;s daughter, is figured as refusing Antoinette&quot;, the daughter of a slave owner.

In the novel, Rhys also explores the legacy of slavery and the slave trade, focusing on how abolition dramatically affected the status of Antoinette&#x27;s family as planters in colonial Jamaica. Scholar Trevor Hope has noted that the &quot;triumphant conflagration of Thornfield Hall in &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; may at one level mark a vengeful attack upon the earlier textual structure&quot;. The destruction of Thornfield Hall occurs in both novels; however, Rhys epitomises the fire as a liberating experience for Antoinette. Hope has suggested that the novel &quot;[takes] residence inside the textual domicile of empire in order to bring about its disintegration or even, indeed, its conflagration&quot;.

==Publication and reception==
Rhys&#x27;s editor Diana Athill discusses the events surrounding the publication of the book in her memoir. The book came out of a friendship between Rhys and Selma Vaz Dias who encouraged her to start writing again. At the time, Rhys was living in a shack made of corrugated iron and tar paper in a slum neighbourhood of Cheriton Fitzpaine. The book was virtually completed in November 1964 when Rhys, who was 74 years old and complained of the cold and rain in her shack, suffered a heart attack. Athill cared for Rhys in the hospital for two years, keeping a promise not to publish the book until Rhys was well enough to compile the manuscript and add a few final lines. The income from the book provided enough money for Rhys to improve her living conditions.

On 5 November 2019, &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

<doc id="854387" wikidata="Q1550377" url="?curid=854387" title="Methods of Mayhem">
<text>Methods of Mayhem is an American rap rock band formed in 1999 by Tommy Lee, who had temporarily quit his position as Mötley Crüe&#x27;s drummer.

==History==
Lee formed Methods of Mayhem on the eve of his divorce from Pamela Anderson. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in late 1999 and went on to be certified gold. The album featured appearances by Fred Durst, The Crystal Method, U-God, Kid Rock, Snoop Dogg, Lil&#x27; Kim, George Clinton and Mix Master Mike. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty good for what it is,&quot; Lee&#x27;s former Mötley Crüe band member Nikki Sixx conceded in 2000, &quot;I guess you&#x27;d call it rap-rock.&quot; The band disbanded for the first time in September 2000.

In March 2009, Lee announced that he was reforming Methods of Mayhem and would start recording new music. Drummer Will Hunt, guitarist J3, guitarist Phil X (who contributed to the first album), and touring bassist Marty O&#x27;Brien contributed to the sophomore album, &quot;A Public Disservice Announcement&quot;, released in September 2010. A live performance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; saw Morgan Rose (of Sevendust) playing drums, DJ Aero on turntables, J3 on guitar and vocals, and Lee on vocals and guitar. No bass player was on stage during the performance. Methods of Mayhem later signed to Loud &amp; Proud/Roadrunner Records.

On April 2, 2019, it was announced that Lee had resurrected the project and had plans to release a new album in the future.

== Style ==

The band&#x27;s self-titled debut featured a rap metal style, while &quot;A Public Disservice Announcement&quot; was more varied in style, covering genres such as rap rock, nu metal and dance-rock.

<doc id="854391" wikidata="Q4882676" url="?curid=854391" title="Belgrave, Leicester">
<text>Belgrave is an area, suburb, electoral ward and administrative division of the city of Leicester, in the ceremonial county of Leicestershire, England. Belgrave is the location of and known for several notable landmarks such as the National Space Centre, Space Park Leicester, Abbey Pumping Station, the Golden Mile and Belgrave Hall.

The old Belgrave Village, containing the Belgrave Conservation Area, including Belgrave Hall, St Peter&#x27;s Church, Belgrave House and The Talbot Pub is to the west of Loughborough Road and to the east of the River Soar.

==Geography==

Belgrave is bounded by the wards and areas of the suburb of Rushey Mead and the village of Birstall to the north, Spinney Hills, North Evington and Northfields to the east on the other side of the Midland Main Line, St Matthew&#x27;s and Leicester City Centre to the south and Beaumont Leys and Stocking Farm to the west. It is located just north of the centre of Leicester, in the eastern part of the city. The old village part of Belgrave is close to the Leicestershire county border and the Borough of Charnwood at the beginning of the Leicester Urban Area in that direction which is located on the other side of Red Hill Circle. Belgrave therefore stretches from and adjoins the city centre and the county.

==Etymology==
The settlement was named in the Domesday Book as &quot;Merdegrave&quot; (from Old English &quot;mearð&quot; &#x27;marten&#x27; + &quot;grāf&quot; &#x27;grove&#x27;). However, after the Norman Conquest the &quot;merde&quot;, which means &quot;excrement&quot; in French, was changed to &quot;bel&quot;.

==History==
Belgrave was originally one of Leicestershire’s ancient villages, the first mention of which, under its original Saxon name of Merdegrave (which in old English means Martins grove) appears in Domesday Book of 1086 where it is listed amongst the lands given to Hugh de Grandmesnil. Grandmesnil had fought at the side of William the Conqueror at Hastings and was his chief cavalry commander. As a reward for his services he was granted several manors/lands of which this was one. by the King. The land consisted of a mill, of meadow and land for six ploughs. For centuries afterwards Belgrave continued as a small agricultural village.

During the Middle Ages Belgrave became one of Leicestershire’s wealthier livings. In the thirteenth century its value rocketed. In 1217 it was valued at 16 marks, at 30 in 1254 and at 60 in 1291.

Belgrave was one of the communities in Leicestershire that experienced the shock of military confrontation because of its situation on the busy London to Derby road which cut right through the heart of the village unlike neighbouring Birstall and Wanlip which it bypassed by some hundreds of yards.

When the English Civil War burst violently into Belgrave, records indicate that there were a number of skirmishes between the opposing forces around the Thurcaston Road bridge and inside St Peter&#x27;s Church. There is damage to the Tudor Memorial to Ambrose de Belgrave which suggests that it may have been used for target practice.

With large 19th century terraced developments along the A607 (Belgrave Road and Melton Road), this area now has a large, vibrant Asian community featuring the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;. The Asian community based in and around Belgrave and Melton Road have been residents since the early 1970s.

The Belgrave Hall area is a conservation area.

Belgrave is home to Belgrave Hall &amp; Gardens. Belgrave Hall, built between 1709 and 1713 is a Grade II* listed building in a plain classical style. The Hall is in the midst of two acres of serene walled gardens that are open to the public during special events. It has changed hands many times, but the owners have always played a major role in the economic, social and charitable life of the community.

St Peter&#x27;s Church is the oldest building in the local conservation area, parts of which date from the twelfth century. Archaeologists believe there may be an earlier Saxon church beneath the present structure.

The Talbot Inn has origins in the 14th century, when it was a popular stop providing bed and board to those who travelled through Leicester along Loughborough Road.

As can be seen by some of the houses along Loughborough Road there were some very wealthy residents, including the Chief constable of Leicester at one point.

As the wealth of the area grew so did the population and by the late 19th century many more houses were being built.

As Belgrave grew so did the town of Leicester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 11,405. On 31 October 1891 most of the parish became part of the County Borough of Leicester, on 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form Leicester.

The area continued to expand with some of the earlier 19th century houses being replaced by 1930s semis. By the 1960s and 1970s large parts of Belgrave were cleared of the old Victorian terraced houses including Mellor School, the Baptist Church on Loughborough Road and Claremont Street Methodist Church, and were replaced with more modern structures.

In 1975 the old area of the village was declared a Conservation area, and it is this area that represents the nucleus of the ancient village.

<doc id="854392" wikidata="Q1195350" url="?curid=854392" title="The Magus (novel)">
<text>The Magus (1965) is a postmodern novel by British author John Fowles, telling the story of Nicholas Urfe, a young British graduate who is teaching English on a small Greek island. Urfe becomes embroiled in the psychological illusions of a master trickster, which become increasingly dark and serious. Considered an example of metafiction, it was the first novel written by Fowles but his second novel to be published. A revised edition was published in 1977.

In 1999, &quot;The Magus&quot; was ranked on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 93 on the editors&#x27; list and number 71 on the readers&#x27; list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 67 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

==Background==
&quot;The Magus&quot; was the first book John Fowles wrote, but his third to be published, after &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Aristos&quot; (1964). He started writing it in the 1950s, under the original title of &quot;The Godgame&quot;. He based it partly on his experiences on the Greek island of Spetses, where he taught English for two years at the Anargyrios School. He worked on it for twelve years before its publication in 1965. Despite critical and commercial success, he continued to rework it, publishing a final revision in 1977.

==Plot summary==
The story reflects the perspective of Nicholas Urfe, a young Oxford graduate and aspiring poet. After graduation, he briefly works as a teacher at a small school, but becomes bored and decides to leave England. While looking for another job, Nicholas takes up with Alison Kelly, a young Australian woman he meets at a party in London. He goes on to accept a post teaching English at the Lord Byron School on the Greek island of Phraxos. After beginning his new post, he becomes bored, depressed, disillusioned and overwhelmed by his life on the Mediterranean island; Nicholas struggles with loneliness and contemplates suicide. While habitually wandering around the island, he stumbles upon an estate and soon meets its owner, Maurice Conchis, a wealthy Greek recluse. They develop a sort of friendship, and Conchis slowly reveals that he may have collaborated with the Nazis during World War II.

Nicholas is gradually drawn into Conchis&#x27;s psychological games, his paradoxical views on life, his mysterious persona and his eccentric masques. At first, Nicholas takes these machinations of Conchis, what the novel terms the &quot;godgame&quot;, to be a joke, but they grow more elaborate and intense. Nicholas loses his ability to determine what is real and what is artifice. Against his will and knowledge, he becomes a performer in the godgame. Eventually, Nicholas realises that the re-enactments of the Nazi occupation, the absurd playlets after Sade, and the obscene parodies of Greek myths are not about Conchis&#x27;s life, but his own.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Nicholas Urfe – the protagonist, a 26-year-old Englishman who goes to Greece to teach English and one day stumbles upon &quot;the waiting room&quot;
* Alison Kelly – Nicholas&#x27; recent Australian girlfriend, whom he abandons to go to Greece
* Maurice Conchis – a wealthy intellectual who is a main player in the masques
* Lily Montgomery / Julie Holmes / Vanessa Maxwell – a young woman who is involved in the masques and with whom Nicholas falls in love

===Other===
* Joe – a young black American, involved in the masques
* Maria – Conchis&#x27;s maid
* Demetriades – a fellow teacher at the school
* Lily de Seitas (older) – Lily&#x27;s mother
* Rose de Seitas – Lily&#x27;s identical twin sister
* Benji de Seitas – the younger brother of the Seitas twins
* Kemp – an unmarried woman who rents Nicholas a room in London
* Jojo – a young girl whom Nicholas pays to accompany him

=== Story characters ===
* de Deukans
* Gustav Nygaard
* Henrik Nygaard
* Anton
* Wimmel

==Ending==
The book ends indeterminately. Fowles received many letters from readers wanting to know which of the two apparently possible outcomes occur. He refused to answer the question conclusively, however, sometimes changing his answer to suit the inquirer. The novel ends quoting the refrain of the &quot;Pervigilium Veneris&quot;, an anonymous work of fourth-century Latin poetry, which has been taken as indicating the possible preferred resolution of the ending&#x27;s ambiguity.

==Literary precedents==
John Fowles wrote an article about his experiences in the island of Spetses and their influence on the book. He acknowledged some literary works as influences in his foreword to the 1977 revised edition of &quot;The Magus&quot;, including Alain-Fournier&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes,&quot; for showing a secret hidden world to be explored, and Richard Jefferies&#x27;s &quot;Bevis&quot; (1882), for projecting a very different world. In the revised edition, Fowles referred to a &quot;Miss Havisham&quot;, a likely reference to the character Miss Havisham in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1861).

==Critical reception==
* &quot;A major work of mounting tensions in which the human mind is the guinea-pig ... Mr. Fowles has taken a big swing at a difficult subject and his hits ... are on the bull&#x27;s eye&quot; (&quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;)
* &quot;A deliciously toothsome celebration of wanton story-telling ... Before one quite realises what is happening, one finds oneself no less avid for meanings and no less starving amid a plethora of clues than is Nicholas himself&quot; (&quot;Sunday Times&quot;)
* &quot;A splendidly sustained piece of mystification ... such as could otherwise only have been devised by a literary team fielding the Marquis de Sade, Arthur Edward Waite, James George Frazer, Gurdjieff, Madame Blavatsky, C.G. Jung, Aleister Crowley, and Franz Kafka&quot; (&quot;Financial Times&quot;)
* The novel was featured on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels: It ranked as No. 71 on the Readers&#x27; List and No. 93 on the Critics&#x27; List of the top 100 novels.

==Adaptations==

The novel was adapted for film with a screenplay by Fowles, directed by Guy Green, and released in 1968. It starred Michael Caine as Nicholas Urfe, Anthony Quinn as Maurice Conchis, Anna Karina as Alison, Candice Bergen as Lily / Julie, and Julian Glover as Anton. It was filmed on the island of Majorca. The adaptation generally was considered a failure as film; when Peter Sellers was asked whether he would make changes in his life if he had the opportunity to do it all over again, he jokingly replied, &quot;I would do everything exactly the same except I wouldn&#x27;t see &quot;The Magus&quot;.&quot; Caine said that it was one of the worst films in which he had been involved because no one knew what it was about. Despite the critical failure, the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography.

BBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2016 a dramatisation by Adrian Hodges, with Charles Dance in the role of Conchis.

In 2020, a new television miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Magus&quot; was announced to be in development at Neal Street Productions, with Johan Renck being looked at to direct based on a screenplay written by Tom Edge.

<text>Grofri was a brand of cars manufactured in Austria from 1921 to 1931 (1924 to 1927 under licence from the French Amilcar). SV 903 cc or 1074 cc four-cylinder engines were used in these sporting cyclecars. Racing versions were also made, some of them with Roots superchargers. The Gross &amp; Friedmann house in Altzerdorf near Vienna manufactured these vehicles.

The racing cars were successful, particularly in hillclimbs. Successful race car driver Max Hoffmann (later known for introducing the United States to imports such as the Volkswagen, the Porsche 356, and the BMW) was selected as Grofri&#x27;s factory driver. He continued racing until his final event, a 1936 hillclimb. Famous opera singer Käthe Rantzau also successfully ran a fast Grofri in hill races.

<doc id="854399" wikidata="Q1169793" url="?curid=854399" title="Tobacco Road (novel)">
<text>Tobacco Road is a 1932 novel by Erskine Caldwell about a dysfunctional family of Georgia sharecroppers during the Great Depression. Although often portrayed as a work of social realism, the novel contains many elements of black comedy and sensationalism which made it a subject of controversy following its publication. It was dramatized for Broadway by Jack Kirkland in 1933 and ran for eight years. A 1941 film version, played mainly for laughs, was directed by John Ford, with many of the darker plot elements altered or removed.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; number 91 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The novel was included in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944.

&quot;Tobacco Road&quot; has sold over 10 million copies.

==Setting==
&quot;Tobacco Road&quot; is set in rural Georgia during the worst years of the Great Depression. It depicts a family of poor white tenant farmers, the Lesters, as some of the many small Southern cotton farmers made redundant by the industrialization of production and the migration into cities. The main character of the novel is Jeeter Lester, an ignorant and sinful man who is redeemed by his love of the land and his faith in the fertility and promise of the soil.

The precise setting of the novel is unclear. The Jeeters&#x27; home is said at one point to be located on &quot;the most desirable soil in the entire west-central part of Georgia&quot;, but other passages describe it as being close to the Savannah River and Augusta, which are in eastern Georgia. These references would appear to place their home in Richmond County, of which Augusta is the county seat. The county in which the Jeeters live is also said to be adjacent to Burke County, which Richmond County is. However, the county seat of the Jeeters&#x27; county is not Augusta but the fictional town of Fuller. The Jeeters are also said to live near the fictional town of McCoy.

==Plot summary==
Lov Bensey, a friend of the Lesters, walks to his home at the train yard coal chute. He has walked seven and a half miles to get a sack of winter turnips for 50 cents, which is half of his daily wage. On his way home, he stops by the Lesters to talk to Jeeter about Jeeter&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter Pearl, to whom Lov is married. While Lov is talking to Jeeter, the book introduces the reader to 16-year-old Dude, the youngest of the Lester boys; Ada, Jeeter’s wife; Grandma Lester; and Ellie May, an 18-year-old girl with a grotesque cleft lip. The entire family, acting in complete desperation, works to steal the turnips from Lov, who then becomes nauseated by the sight and leaves for home.

At this point, the preacher Bessie enters the scene. Sister Bessie Rice, like Ellie May, also has a deformity of the face. Bessie’s nose contains no bone, and so when looking straight at her face one can see straight into her nostrils, like a pig. Despite this, Jeeter is still attracted to her. She does some preaching and praying for everyone’s sins, and then proposes marriage to Dude. However, Dude is more interested in her offer of letting him drive the new automobile that she anticipates purchasing than in actually marrying her. Bessie then goes home to her hovel to ask God whether or not she and Dude should get married.

Jeeter has lived on the same plot of land since he was born, and even though his standard of living continues to decline until he and his family begin to starve, Jeeter stubbornly refuses to move to the city to make a better life for himself by working in a cotton mill. Such a life, he insists, would be impossible for him to live.

Alongside Jeeter’s preoccupation with farming the land is his preoccupation with his own imminent death. Ada as well is fixated on her death, but their morbidity does not take the form of lamentation or self-pity. Ada&#x27;s main concern is that she not be buried in her tattered, old, out-of-style calico dress, and Jeeter&#x27;s main concern is that his body not be left in the old corn storage shed where it might be eaten by rats. He has had a terrible phobia of rats ever since he saw his dead father’s face half-eaten by a rat the day of his funeral. Neither of these two characters have any doubts that they are going to die sometime soon, and it is not their present life but their lifeless bodies which they care about most. Possibly they realize that their way of life is already dead; thus their primary concern becomes not the preservation of that life but its appearance during burial.

When Sister Bessie returns the next day to the Lester house, she exclaims that God has given her his approval for the marriage between Dude and herself. The two then start the long walk to Fuller in order to purchase a new Ford for the purpose of traveling around the country and preaching. Once they are in the auto showroom, the salesmen take advantage of Bessie&#x27;s rural naïveté to pull off a quick and profitable sale, while at the same time constantly making fun of her deformed nose. Later, Dude and Bessie go off to get their marriage certificate and are questioned by the county official, who reprimands Bessie for attempting to marry a boy of 16 years. (Bessie claims she is only 31 years old to the Lesters, but admits to 39 years at the registrar&#x27;s office.) Finally, they get the marriage license, and the anxious Dude gets to drive the automobile again. Dude incessantly sounds the car horn whenever he gets behind the steering wheel to drive off somewhere.

Over the course of the next two days, the automobile slowly gets wrecked more and more. First there is an accident with a wagon in which they end up killing the negro driver, and then Dude drives into a stump. The seats get torn by Jeeter’s blackjack wood, which he attempts to sell in the city of Augusta. The engine irreparably becomes damaged by being run without enough oil. On top of this, they sell the spare tire and wheel for three dollars in order to pay for gasoline, food, and a night at a disreputable hotel where Bessie willingly gets prostituted from room to room by the manager. Some days later Bessie refuses to let Jeeter ride in her car anymore, which makes him upset to the point of kicking her off the land. When she physically attacks him, Ada and Jeeter proceed to beat Bessie and poke her with sticks until she and Dude take off in the car.

While fleeing from Ada and Jeeter’s onslaught, Dude backs the Ford right over Grandma Lester, who then lies with her face mashed into the sand, near dead. Lov runs down to see Jeeter, and asks him if he knows what happened to Pearl, who had run away to Augusta to be free of Lov and the bleak and desperate country life surrounding her. Jeeter notes that more than a few of his daughters have run away to the city. After this discussion about the girls running away, the two notice Grandma’s corpse and drag her into the field to dig her grave and bury her.

Lov departs and Caldwell reflects on Jeeter&#x27;s position as a tenant farmer in the South. Even though Jeeter, like so many others around him, had the urge to plant a crop during this time of the year, there was nothing he could do. His landlord was an absentee who abandoned Jeeter and the rest of those who had lived on his land and given him shares of their crop in exchange for credit for seeds and fertilizer. The stores in the city would not grant any more credit to Jeeter or any of the other farmers because it was too risky and there were too many asking for it.

Jeeter sets a fire to burn off broom sedge and hopes somehow to find enough credit to farm his land that spring. As Jeeter and Ada sleep, sparks from the fire ignite the shingles of their house, which burns to the ground, killing them in their sleep. As the novel closes, Dude makes his first mention of working: He voices the same thoughts of plowing the Lester land that Jeeter had expressed throughout the story, indicating that the vicious cycle in which poor Southern farmers such as the Lesters are trapped continues.

<text>&quot;para&quot;-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA), also known as 4-methoxyamphetamine (4-MA), is a designer drug of the amphetamine class with serotonergic effects. Unlike other similar drugs of this family, PMA does not produce stimulant, euphoriant, or entactogen effects, and behaves more like an antidepressant in comparison, though it does have some psychedelic properties.

PMA has been found in tablets touted as MDMA (ecstasy) although its effects are markedly different compared to those of MDMA. The consequences of such deception have often included hospitalization and death for unwitting users. PMA is commonly synthesized from anethole, the flavor compound of anise and fennel, mainly because the starting material for MDMA, safrole, has become less available due to law enforcement action, causing illicit drug manufacturers to use anethole as an alternative.

== Adverse effects ==
PMA has been associated with numerous adverse reactions including death. Effects of PMA ingestion include many effects of the hallucinogenic amphetamines including accelerated and irregular heartbeat, blurred vision, and a strong feeling of intoxication that is often unpleasant. At high doses unpleasant effects such as nausea and vomiting, severe hyperthermia and hallucinations may occur. The effects of PMA also seem to be much more unpredictable and variable between individuals than those of MDMA, and sensitive individuals may die from a dose of PMA by which a less susceptible person might only be mildly affected. While PMA alone may cause significant toxicity, the combination of PMA with MDMA has a synergistic effect that seems to be particularly hazardous. Since PMA has a slow onset of effects, several deaths have occurred where individuals have taken a pill containing PMA, followed by a pill containing MDMA some time afterwards due to thinking that the first pill was not active.

== Overdose ==

PMA overdose can be a serious medical emergency that may occur at only slightly above the usual recreational dose range, especially if PMA is mixed with other stimulant drugs such as cocaine or MDMA. Characteristic symptoms are pronounced hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, along with agitation, confusion, and convulsions. PMA overdose also tends to cause hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia, which can help to distinguish it from MDMA overdose. Complications can sometimes include more serious symptoms such as rhabdomyolysis and cerebral hemorrhage, requiring emergency surgery. There is no specific antidote, so treatment is symptomatic, and usually includes both external cooling, and internal cooling via IV infusion of cooled saline. Benzodiazepines are used initially to control convulsions, with stronger anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or thiopental used if convulsions continue. Blood pressure can be lowered either with a combination of alpha blockers and beta blockers (or a mixed alpha/beta blocker), or with other drugs such as nifedipine or nitroprusside. Serotonin antagonists and dantrolene may be used as required. Despite the seriousness of the condition, the majority of patients survive if treatment is given in time, however, patients with a core body temperature over 40 °C at presentation tend to have a poor prognosis.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
PMA acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Its values for induction of monoamine release are 166nM for dopamine and 867nM for norepinephrine in rat brain synaptosomes, whereas serotonin was not reported. The drug has been found to robustly increase brain serotonin levels and to weakly increase brain dopamine levels in rodents &quot;in vivo&quot;. Relative to MDMA, PMA appears to be considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin, with properties more akin to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in comparison.

PMA has also been shown to act as a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) with no significant effects on monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The of PMA for MAO-A inhibition has been reported to be 300 to 600nM.

PMA evokes robust hyperthermia in rodents while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA, and only at very high doses. Accordingly, it is not self-administered by rodents unlike amphetamine and MDMA. Anecdotal reports by humans suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast.

It appears that PMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing serotonin syndrome. Amphetamines, especially serotonergic analogues such as MDMA, are strongly contraindicated to take with MAOIs. Many amphetamines and adrenergic compounds raise body temperatures, whereas some tend to produce more euphoric activity or peripheral vasoconstriction, and may tend to favor one effect over another. It appears that PMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like ephedrine, thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities). Many people taking PMA try to get rid of the heat by taking off their clothes, taking cold showers or wrapping themselves in wet towels, and even sometimes by shaving off their hair.

== History ==
PMA first came into circulation in the early 1970s, where it was used intentionally as a substitute for the hallucinogenic properties of LSD. It went by the street names of &quot;Chicken Powder&quot; and &quot;Chicken Yellow&quot; and was found to be the cause of a number of drug overdose deaths (the dosages taken being in the range of hundreds of milligrams) in the United States and Canada from that time. Between 1974 and the mid-1990s, there appear to have been no known fatalities from PMA.

Several deaths reported as MDMA-induced in Australia in the mid-1990s are now considered to have been caused by PMA, the users unaware that they were ingesting PMA and not MDMA as they had intended. There have been a number of PMA-induced deaths around the world since then.

In July 2013, seven deaths in Scotland were linked to tablets containing PMA that had been mis-sold as ecstasy and which had the Rolex crown logo on them. Several deaths in Northern Ireland, Particularly East Belfast were also linked to &quot;Green Rolex&quot; pills during that month.

In 2014, 2015 and early 2016, PMA sold as ecstasy was the cause of more deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Argentina. The pills containing the drug were reported to be red triangular tablets with a &quot;Superman&quot; logo.

The Red Ferarri pills are a new press of the &quot;Superman&quot; logo tablets that were reported to be found in Germany and Norway from 2016 to 2017.

== Society and culture ==

===Legal status===
====International====
PMA is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

====Australia====
PMA is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

====Finland====
Substance is scheduled in decree of the government on amending the government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs.

====Germany====
PMA is part of the Appendix 1 of the Betäubungsmittelgesetz. Therefore, owning and distribution of PMA is illegal.

====Netherlands====
On 13 June 2012 Edith Schippers, Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, revoked the legality of PMA in the Netherlands after five deaths were reported in that year.

====United Kingdom====
PMA is a Class A drug in the UK.

====United States====
PMA is classified as a Schedule I hallucinogen under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States.

=== Economics ===

====Distribution====
Because PMA is given out through the same venues and distribution channels that MDMA tablets are, the risk of being severely injured, hospitalized or even dying from use of ecstasy increases significantly when a batch of ecstasy pills containing PMA starts to be sold in a particular area. PMA pills could be a variety of colours or imprints, and there is no way of knowing just from the appearance of a pill what drug(s) it might contain. Notable batches of pills containing PMA have included Louis Vuitton, Mitsubishi Turbo, Blue Transformers, Red/Blue Mitsubishi and Yellow Euro pills. Also PMA has been found in powder form.

==== Analogues ====

Four analogues of PMA have been reported to be sold on the black market, including PMMA, PMEA, 4-ETA and 4-MTA. These are the N-methyl, N-ethyl, 4-ethoxy and 4-methylthio analogues of PMA, respectively. PMMA and PMEA are anecdotally weaker, more &quot;ecstasy-like&quot; and somewhat less dangerous than PMA itself, but can still produce nausea and hyperthermia similar to that produced by PMA, albeit at slightly higher doses. 4-EtOA was briefly sold in Canada in the 1970s, but little is known about it. 4-MTA, however, is even more dangerous than PMA and produces strong serotonergic effects and intense hyperthermia, but with little to no euphoria, and was implicated in several deaths in the late 1990s.

<text>The &quot;Zara&quot; class was a group of four heavy cruisers built for the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) in the late 1920s and the early 1930s. The class comprised the vessels , , , and , the last of which was completed to a slightly different design. The ships were a substantial improvement over the preceding s, incorporating significantly heavier armor protection at the cost of the very high speed of the &quot;Trento&quot;s. They carried the same main battery of eight guns and had a maximum speed of . Among the best-protected heavy cruisers built by any navy in the 1930s, the heavy armor was acquired only by violating the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruiser displacement to .

All four ships served with the main fleet in the interwar period, where they were primarily occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Gorizia&quot; evacuated Italian nationals and &quot;Pola&quot; took part in non-intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces, including the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan. During the latter engagement, &quot;Pola&quot; was immobilized by an aerial torpedo, and then along with &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Fiume&quot; were all sunk in a one-sided night action with three British battleships.

&quot;Gorizia&quot; continued in service, seeing further action at the First and Second Battles of Sirte. She was seriously damaged by American heavy bombers in April 1943 and towed to La Spezia, where she was still under repair when Italy surrendered in September. Germany seized the ship when they occupied the port, and Italian commandos unsuccessfully attempted to sink her in June 1944. In poor condition by the end of the war, the postwar Italian Navy decided to sell the ship for scrap in 1947.

==Design==
While the preceding of heavy cruisers were still being built, elements of the Italian naval command began to doubt the effectiveness of the new vessels, which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds. They advocated a more balanced design that would incorporate more comprehensive armor, with a main belt that was thick, while retaining the battery of eight guns and a speed of at least . The designers quickly found that these characteristics could not be incorporated into a vessel that remained within the limit imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The naval command agreed to allow the new ships to exceed the displacement limits, but instructed the designers to eliminate unnecessary features to save as much weight as possible. As a result, the belt armor was reduced in thickness and the planned torpedo tubes were removed. The flush deck of the &quot;Trento&quot;s was abandoned, with the ships instead incorporating a forecastle deck and a stepped-down main deck. In addition, the &quot;Zara&quot; design would be powered by just two propellers driven by lightweight machinery, unlike the four-shaft arrangement used in the &quot;Trento&quot;s. Nevertheless, the ships still exceeded the displacement limit by at least . By 1928, the work was finished on what would become the &quot;Zara&quot; class, and the first two ships, and , were ordered for the 1928–1929 building program. followed in the 1929–1930 construction year, and was ordered under the 1930–1931 program. All four ships were named for formerly Austro-Hungarian cities that were annexed to Italy in the aftermath of World War I.

===General characteristics===
The ships of the &quot;Zara&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The ships had a standard displacement of , and displaced at full load, with &quot;Fiume&quot; being the lightest of the four and &quot;Gorizia&quot; the heaviest. The first three ships were built with light superstructures as a weight saving measure, but &quot;Pola&quot;, intended to serve as a flagship, received a much larger bridge structure to accommodate an admiral&#x27;s staff. All four ships received two tripod masts, with the forward mast erected over the bridge. They had a crew of 841 officers and enlisted men. The ships carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the centerline at the bow.

The ships&#x27; power plant consisted of two Parsons steam turbines powered by eight oil-fired Thornycroft boilers, with the exception of &quot;Fiume&quot;, which received Yarrow boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels amidships. Their engines were rated at and produced a top speed of , though on sea trials all four vessels significantly exceeded those figures, reaching a minimum of and speeds of . Nevertheless, in service, their practical speeds were in the range of . The vessels each carried of fuel oil, which allowed them to steam for at a cruising speed of . When operating at maximum speed, their operational radius fell to , though due to the fact that Italian naval vessels were intended to operate only within the narrow confines of the Mediterranean Sea, their relatively short cruising range was not a significant problem.

===Armament and armor===
The &quot;Zara&quot;s were armed with a main battery of eight 203 mm Mod 29 53-caliber guns in four gun turrets. The turrets were arranged in superfiring pairs forward and aft. The guns fired shells at a muzzle velocity of , with a rate of fire of about three and a half rounds per minute. The turrets allowed elevation to 45 degrees, which provided a maximum range of . Each ship carried 157 shells per gun. Like the &quot;Trento&quot;s, the &quot;Zara&quot;-class ships suffered from shell dispersion that hampered accuracy. The problem was in large part due to poor quality control in Italian munition factories, which failed to ensure tight manufacturing tolerances necessary for accurate shells. In addition, the single cradle mounts required the guns to be very close together; this caused the shells to interfere with each other in flight and contributed to the dispersion problem. In an attempt to rectify the dispersion problem, the guns were supplied with modified shells that fired at .

Anti-aircraft defense was provided by a battery of sixteen  47-cal. guns in twin mounts, four Vickers-Terni /39 guns in single mounts and eight guns in twin mounts. The 100 mm guns were copies of Austro-Hungarian guns designed in 1910 by Škoda that were placed in newly designed dual-purpose mounts that elevated to 85 degrees for a maximum range of . The ships&#x27; secondary battery was revised several times during their careers. Two of the 100 mm guns and all of the 40 mm guns were removed in the late 1930s and eight 54-cal. guns were installed in their place. Two 15-cal. star shell guns were added in 1940. In 1942, the star shell guns aboard &quot;Gorizia&quot;, by this time the only surviving member of the class, were replaced with four more 37 mm guns. The following year, a battery of fourteen guns in six twin and two single mounts replaced the  machine guns.

The ships were protected with an armored citadel that covered the ships&#x27; vitals, including the machinery spaces and ammunition magazines. Vertical protection consisted of an armored belt that was thick at the waterline and reduced to at the bottom edge of the belt. Their main armor deck was thick, and the box formed by the belt and deck was capped at either end by armored bulkheads that were thick in the upper portion and in the lower section. The main deck was supplemented with an upper deck that was thick, which was intended to detonate the fuses of incoming shells before they struck the main deck; the upper deck was connected to an upper belt that was thick. The gun turrets had 150 mm thick plating on the faces and the barbettes they sat in were also 150 mm thick. The main conning tower had 150 mm thick sides and an thick roof.

The &quot;Zara&quot; class carried three times the armor protection of the preceding &quot;Trento&quot;s. Their heavy armor made the &quot;Zara&quot;s the best-protected cruisers until the introduction of the , laid down in 1945 by the United States. This additional armor would have made the ships decidedly nose-heavy, so to offset this the rear of the ship was raised by one deck behind the front funnel. The result was excellent watertight integrity and protection.

==Service history==
After entering service in the early 1930s, the four members of the &quot;Zara&quot; class took part in training exercises with the Italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. &quot;Gorizia&quot; and &quot;Pola&quot; were involved in the Spanish Civil War; in 1936 &quot;Pola&quot; conducted non-intervention patrols and &quot;Gorizia&quot; carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France that year. After departing France, &quot;Gorizia&quot; visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank that forced her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty&#x27;s displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them to stop in Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, &quot;Zara&quot;, &quot;Pola&quot;, and &quot;Gorizia&quot; provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania.

The &quot;Zara&quot;-class cruisers saw extensive service during World War II, having taken part in several sorties to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean as the flagship of the 1st Division. At the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier attacked the &quot;Zara&quot;-class cruisers, but they failed to score any hits. The ships steamed ahead to the front of the Italian line of battle and joined the attack on the leading British battleship, , but they scored no hits. British cruisers attacked as the Italians withdrew, but heavy fire from the Italian cruisers drove them off. All four ships escaped damage at the Battle of Taranto in November 1940. 

In March 1941 at the Battle of Cape Matapan, &quot;Pola&quot; was immobilized by a torpedo from a Swordfish torpedo bomber launched by the British aircraft carrier ; &quot;Zara&quot; and &quot;Fiume&quot; were detached from the rest of the fleet to protect &quot;Pola&quot;, and all three and a pair of destroyers were sunk in a close-range night engagement with the battleships , , and &quot;Warspite&quot;. Italian casualties were very heavy, with 783 killed aboard &quot;Zara&quot;, 328 killed aboard &quot;Pola&quot;, 812 aboard &quot;Fiume&quot;. The survivors, mostly from &quot;Pola&quot;, were rescued primarily by British destroyers, though Greek destroyers and an Italian hospital ship picked up others over the following few days.

&quot;Gorizia&quot;, the sole surviving member of the class, saw action at the First Battle of Sirte in December 1941 and Second Sirte in March 1942, where she was heavily engaged with British light cruisers and destroyers. As the action took place at very long range, neither side scored any hits. During this period, the ship also took part in convoy escort operations to supply Italian and German forces in North Africa. While the ship was moored in La Maddalena on 10 April 1943, a major attack from United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers sank the heavy cruiser and hit &quot;Gorizia&quot; with three bombs, inflicting serious damage. She was still under repair in La Spezia when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, and she was seized by German forces when they occupied much of the country. On 22 June 1944, Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedoes to enter the harbor and sink &quot;Gorizia&quot; and the heavy cruiser , which was also out of service due to battle damage, to prevent them from being used as blockships though &quot;Gorizia&quot; survived the attack. She was nevertheless sold for scrap in 1947, since it would have been cost-prohibitive to repair her.

<text>The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly, sometimes known simply as The Weekly, is an Australian monthly women&#x27;s magazine published by Are Media in Sydney and founded in 1933. For many years it was the number one magazine in Australia before being outsold by the Australian edition of &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; in 2014. , &quot;The Weekly&quot; has overtaken &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; again, coming out on top as Australia&#x27;s most read magazine. The magazine invested in the 2020 film &quot;I Am Woman&quot; about Helen Reddy, singer and feminist icon.

==History and profile==
The magazine was started in 1933 by Frank Packer and Ted Theodore as a weekly publication. The first editor was George Warnecke and the initial dummy was laid out by William Edwin Pidgeon who went on to do many famous covers over the next 25 years. It was to have two distinctive features; firstly, the newspaper&#x27;s features would have an element of topicality, and secondly the magazine would appeal to all Australian women, regardless of class, and have a national focus. Wanting it to appeal to a mass audience, Warnecke hoped &quot;The Weekly&quot; would be a sign that Australia finally was coming out of the Depression. Jean Williamson was hired (moving from the Sydney Morning Herald) where she was surprised to find that she was the editor for &quot;fiction&quot;. Soon letters were arriving from women who were obviously lonely and light fiction brought them comfort.

In the coming decades, &quot;The Weekly&quot; became Australia&#x27;s foremost publisher of light fiction, mostly from England but also Australian, and though its readership was mostly women, many men were avid readers. Australian authors who were well supported include Margot Neville, Mary Gilmore, Lennie Lower, Ross Campbell, Frank Dalby Davison and Henrietta Drake-Brockman. Australian artists who enlivened the prose included W. E. Pidgeon, Virgil Reilly and Wynne W. Davies. The cartoon strip &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot; was a longtime competitor to &quot;The Phantom&quot; in rival magazine &quot;The Australian Woman&#x27;s Mirror&quot;. Both strips were the work of American cartoonist Lee Falk. From 1955-1959 the magazine awarded a contemporary art prize.

By 1961, the publication had a circulation of 800,000.

&quot;The Weekly&quot; celebrated its 50th anniversary of publication in June 1983 and its 75th anniversary in the October 2008 issue was published by then Editor-in-Chief Robyn Foyster. The silver foil cover featured Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman with an exclusive interview about their upcoming film, &#x27;Australia&#x27;. The 75th Birthday was marked with an anniversary party of 75 VIP guests at Fort Denison in Sydney. Robyn also re-introduced The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly Book Club which was launched at an event in Sydney in 2008 by award-winning writer Di Morrissey, who had begun her career as a cadet at The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly. Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) launched &quot;Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; versions in Singapore (1997) and Malaysia in 2000. The magazine in each country follows the Australian &quot;Weekly&quot; writing style, while its content is idiosyncratic to the country.
In 2012 the parent company of the magazine, ACP Magazines, a subsidiary of Nine Entertainment, was acquired by the Bauer Media Group.
Audited circulation under Nene King was 980,000. The 60th anniversary edition sold in excess of one-million. 
Audited circulation in June 2013 was 459,175 copies monthly. Readership numbers for September 2014 were estimated to be 1,828,000.

In mid-June 2020, the Sydney–based investment company Mercury Capital acquired &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media&#x27;s Australian and New Zealand magazine brands. In late September 2020, Mercury Capital rebranded Bauer Media as Are Media, which took over publication of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

=== Cultural impact ===
The overall popularity of the magazine between the 1930s–1980s meant that articles and advertisements published in it were widely read across Australia, not only by women, but men as well. The magazine&#x27;s power to influence and shape culture across the nation intersected with the rise of various women&#x27;s and parenting issues. In a review of issues published between the 1930s–1980s, historians have argued that &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; promoted school uniforms for children at a time when school uniforms were not mandatory across the country. This promotion, mainly through targeted coverage of school aged children, shaped views of motherhood and child-rearing throughout Australia. Publications in the magazine focused on products, children&#x27;s fashion, and celebrity children continue to shape readers views of motherhood and child-rearing.

==Format and frequency==
The magazine is usually 240 pages long and printed on glossy paper trimmed to A4 page size, although it was originally a tabloid in size and layout. It typically contains feature articles about the modern Australian woman. For many years, it included a lift-out TV guide.

In 1982, publication frequency was reduced from weekly to monthly. &quot;Weekly&quot; was retained in the name for reasons of familiarity and because a woman&#x27;s &quot;monthly&quot; was a slang term for menstruation. The final weekly edition was dated 15 December 1982, followed by the first monthly edition dated January 1983. The TV guide was discontinued on introduction of the monthly format.

==Editors==
Editors-in-chief of &quot;The Weekly&quot; over the years have included George Warnecke (1933–1939), Alice Mabel Jackson (1939–1950), Esmé (Ezzie) Fenston (1950–1972), Dorothy Drain (1972–1975), Ita Buttrose (1975–76), Jennifer Rowe (1987–1992), Nene King, Dawn Swain (1994–2000), Deborah Thomas (1999–2015), Julia Zaetta (2005–06), Robyn Foyster (2007–2009), Helen McCabe (2009–2016), Kim Wilson (2016–17), Juliet Rieden (who was acting Editor-in-Chief in 2016 and 2017 and then Editor before moving to Editor-at-Large from 2018) and Nicole Byers (2017–2023) and Sophie Tedmanson was appointed as the new Editor in October 2023. 

Robyn Foyster, the editor-in-chief from 2007 to 2009 and later Group Publisher at ACP and Bauer, put Barack and Michelle Obama on the cover of the January, 2009, edition to mark Barack Obama becoming the first black President of the United States. The Obama&#x27;s were also the first black cover stars of &quot;The Weekly&quot;.
Helen McCabe, the editor-in-chief from August 2009 until January 2016, claimed to improve &quot;The Weekly&quot; news coverage. She told The Australian she would not cover Prince William trip to Australia because he refused to give an interview to the magazine. 

In late 2009, she hired Juliet Rieden as deputy editor (Rieden was later promoted to Editor and Acting Editor-in-Chief) and Jordan Baker, formerly a reporter and travel writer for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, as news editor. In February 2016 Kim Wilson was named as the editor-in-chief of the magazine.

In July 2017, Nicole Byers was appointed Editor-in-Chief.

News editors included Les Haylen (from 1933) and Dorothy Drain (from 1958). Nicole Byers stepped down from the role in October 2023 and was replaced by Sophie Tedmanson. 

Being editor of The Weekly is often lauded as one of the most prestigious roles in Australian media.

=== Recipes and cookbooks ===
The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly Test Kitchen (then known as the Leila Howard Test Kitchen) was established just after World War I. From 1965, it continued to be on the same site of the Australian Consolidated Press (ACP) building (corner of Park and Castlereagh Streets) in Sydney. The Test Kitchen&#x27;s first &#x27;Best Ever&#x27; recipes compilation was published in 1976, collating the most-requested recipes from the issues of the Weekly. The cookbook sold out in days and had many reprints.

The Test Kitchen had a team of 16 people in 2006, comprising chefs, home economists, food editors and support staff.

In 2012, ACP was sold to Bauer Media Group. The Test Kitchen triple-tests recipes which are then published in the magazine, as well as Woman&#x27;s Day and the AWW cookbooks. Surveys have shown that over 90 per cent of readers buy the magazine for the recipes.

<doc id="854407" wikidata="Q206173" url="?curid=854407" title="Karel van Mander">
<text>Karel van Mander (I) or Carel van Mander I (May 1548 – 2 September 1606) was a Flemish painter, playwright, poet, art historian and art theoretician, who established himself in the Dutch Republic in the latter part of his life. He is mainly remembered as a biographer of Early Netherlandish painters and Northern Renaissance artists in his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;. As an artist and art theoretician he played a significant role in the spread and development of Northern Mannerism in the Dutch Republic.

==Life==
Most of the information about Karel van Mander&#x27;s life is based on a brief and anonymous biographical sketch included in the posthumous second edition of the Schilder-boeck published in 1618 by Jacob Pietersz Wachter. It is not certain who wrote this biographical sketch with the title &quot;t Geslacht, de geboort, plaets, tydt, leven, ende wercken van Karel van Mander, schilder, en poeet, mitsgaders zyn overlyden, ende begraeffenis&quot; (The lineage, birth, place, time, life, and works of Karel van Mander, painter and poet, including his death and burial). Various candidates have been proposed including his brother Adam van Mander and the author Gerbrand Adriaensz. Bredero. It has been argued more recently that his son Karel van Mander the Younger was the author of the biographical. He would have relied on biographical information that Karel van Mander had written himself as well as on his own recollections and notes. The information in the biographical sketch is not entirely reliable but is still regarded as the best source of information on van Mander&#x27;s life.
Van Mander was born into a noble family in Meulebeke, in the County of Flanders. He studied under Lucas de Heere in Ghent. De Heere was a versatile artist who was painter, watercolorist, print artist, biographer, playwright, poet and writer. During the period 1568-1569 van Mander studied with the painter Pieter Vlerick in Kortrijk. The next five years he was less occupied with painting than with the writing of religious plays for which he also painted the scenery. He built quite a reputation in Flanders with his theatre productions.

In 1573 he travelled to Rome in the company of some young nobles. He stayed in Rome for more than three years. There he was active as a painter and became acquainted with patronage. For the Italian count Michelangelo Spada he made some frescoes with scenes of the Parisian blood wedding of 1572 in the Palazzo Spada in Terni. He also received commissions for frescoes with landscapes from several cardinals. He studied and became proficient in the painting of grotesques during his Roman residence.

His biographical sketch refers to van Mander as the discoverer of &quot;caves&quot; in Rome. This may be a reference to the Catacombs of Rome although the exact meaning of the reference is unclear. In Rome he may also have come into contact with fellow Flemish painter Bartholomeus Spranger, who left Rome in 1575 for Vienna to enter into the service of the emperor. On his return journey he passed through Vienna, where, together with Spranger and the sculptor Hans Mont, he made the triumphal arch for the royal entry of the emperor Rudolf II.
Van Mander settled back in his native Meulebeke in 1578 where he was active as a painter and writer. He married an 18-year-old local girl, with whom he had a son. In 1580 he left for Kortrijk due to religious troubles caused by Catholic zealots in Meulebeke. Karel van Mander had at some point become a Mennonite and was therefore a possible target of these zealots. In Kortrijk he got a commission for an altar piece. In Kortrijk another son was born. He left Kortrijk for Bruges in 1582 because of an outbreak of the plague and other reasons. In Bruges, he worked with the painter Paul Weyts. Because of the threat of religious troubles and the plague, Karel fled with his family and his mother-in-law by ship to the Dutch Republic where he settled in Haarlem in the province of Holland in 1583.

Here he worked for 20 years on a commission by the Haarlem city fathers to inventory &quot;their&quot; art collection. The city of Haarlem had confiscated all Catholic religious art after the satisfactie van Haarlem, which gave Catholics equal rights to Protestants, had been overturned in 1578. Van Mander used his work on the commission in his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;. While in Haarlem he continued to paint, concentrating his energy on his favourite genre: historical allegories. In 1603 he rented a fortified manor (&quot;het Huis te Zevenbergen&quot;), later renamed Kasteel Marquette in Heemskerk to proofread his book that was published in 1604. He died soon after it was published in Amsterdam at the age of 58.

==Haarlem Mannerists==

Karel van Mander was the founder, together with Hubertus Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem, of an &quot;academy to study after life&quot;. It is not entirely clear what this academy did but it is believed it was an informal discussion group which may have organised drawing classes with life models. It has also been claimed that the nature of the academy was more of a literary nature.

He had an important impact on art in the Dutch Republic when in 1585 he showed his friend Hendrick Goltzius drawings by Bartholomeus Spranger. Spranger was then the leading artist of Northern Mannerism and was based in Prague as the court artist of emperor Rudolf II. These drawings had a galvanising effect on Goltzius whose style was influenced by them. Goltzius made engravings of the drawings which were important in disseminating the Mannerist style. Van Mander, Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem became known as the &quot;Haarlem Mannerists&quot; and artists from other towns joined the movement. Their pictorial language was characterised by a strong awareness of style and cultivated elegance. They strove for artful ingenuity rather than naturalism. They also had a preference for depicting exaggeratedly brawny musclemen, violent drama, wild fantasy and a heightened richness of detail. The dissemination of the engravings of Goltzius went hand in hand with the new practice of art theorisation that was new to the 16th century and in which Karel van Mander played an important role.

He received budding artists in his home for evenings of communal drawing and study of classical mythology. After the iconoclasm of the Calvinists, religious themes had gone out of fashion and mythology had become popular. However, few painters could afford a trip to Italy such as the one that van Mander had undertaken. His purpose was to educate young painters in the proper artistic techniques. He was a firm believer in the hierarchy of genres. It was his firm belief that only through proper study of existing works it was possible to realize true-to-life historical allegories.

His own works included mannerist mythological subjects, but also portraits and genre paintings influenced by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, such as the &quot;Kermis&quot; in the Hermitage Museum. Relatively few paintings by him survive.

==Writings==

As a writer van Mander worked in various genres: drama, poetry, songs, biography and art theory. He also translated classical literature. His literary production reflects the two sides of his intellectual and spiritual interests: the humanism of the Renaissance and the religious convictions of a pious mennonite. His earliest works were biblical plays that he wrote while still in Flanders. These have not been preserved.

His first spiritual writings are contained in &quot;De Gulden Harpe&quot;, published in 1597. This poetry volume consists of rather longwinded versification of biblical stories that were intended to educate readers with biblical words. His style developed under the influence of his translation (from the French) of classical literature such as the &quot;Iliad&quot; and, in particular, the &quot;Bucolica&quot; en &quot;Georgica&quot; of Virgil. He abandoned the heavy style of the rhetoricians for the jambs of Virgil in his bundle of spiritual songs published in 1613 after his death under the title &quot;Bethlehem dat is het Broodhuys&quot;.

==&quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;==

Karel van Mander&#x27;s &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;, written in 17th century Dutch and published in Haarlem in 1604 by Passchier van Wesbusch, describes the life and work of more than 250 painters, both historical and contemporary, and explains contemporary art theory for aspiring painters. During his travels and stay in Italy, van Mander had read and was influenced by Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s famous biographical accounts of painters in his book &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, often referred to as the &quot;Vite&quot;. It was published in 1550 and republished in 1568 with woodcuts, which is the version van Mander probably studied. He set about translating this work into Dutch and it was during this project that he was offered the commission to inventory Haarlem&#x27;s art collection, a job that resulted in the chapters of his book on Early Netherlandish painters. In both books, the lives of the painters are told in the standard &quot;Vita di ...&quot; manner of Catholic saints, extolling the virtues of the painters one by one in several chapters. In van Mander&#x27;s book many entries on Italian painters were simply translated or adapted from the Italian &quot;Vite&quot;, but the biographical details on early Netherlandish painters and, in particular the Haarlem painters, are unique and gathered during van Mander&#x27;s commission.

Karel van Mander&#x27;s book also contains an interpretation of the stories in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. This was meant as an aid to artists who wished to paint mythological themes rather than religious ones. Symbolism was very important in painting at the time, and the use of Ovid&#x27;s characters, combined with the proper use of artistic symbolism allowed the artist to tell a specific story. The last chapter of the Schilder-Boeck describes the meaning of animals and other figures.

==Legacy==

Van Mander was the master of Frans Hals. Frans Hals appears not to have shared van Mander&#x27;s view that history painting was the highest in the hierarchy of genres since Frans Hals produced almost solely portrait paintings.

The &quot;Schilder-Boeck&quot; introduced Dutch artists to Italian art and encouraged them to travel, if not follow the book&#x27;s instructions on Italian painting methods. Aside from his son Karel van Mander the Younger and Frans Hals, his registered pupils were Cornelis Engelsz, Everard Crynsz van der Maes, Jacobus Martens (landscape painter and father of the painter Jan Martszen de Jonge), Jacob Martsen (genre painter), Jacob van Musscher, Hendrik Gerritsz Pot and François Venant.

Van Mander was further influential on art writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Cornelis de Bie (&quot;Gulden Cabinet&quot;, 1662), Joachim von Sandrart (&quot;Teutsche Akademie&quot;, 1675), Filippo Baldinucci (&quot;Notizie de&#x27; Professori&quot;, 1681), and Arnold Houbraken (&quot;Schouburg&quot;, 1720) are some of the early biographers who used material from his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; for their biographical sketches of Netherlandish painters. His book is still the most-cited primary source in biographical accounts of the lives of many artists he included. Of most interest to art historians is his criticism of the work of these artists, especially when he describes the location and owner of the paintings, thus becoming a valuable source for art provenance. The &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; is part of the Basic Library of Dutch Literature, which contains the 1000 most important works in Dutch literature from the Middle Ages to today.

<text>, provisional designation , is a 970-meter asteroid and near-Earth object with the second smallest perihelion of any numbered asteroid (0.092 AU—38% of Mercury&#x27;s orbital radius). With its high eccentricity, not only does get very close to the Sun, but it also travels relatively far away from it. It has the third largest aphelion of any numbered Aten asteroid and is one of a small group of Aten asteroids that is also a Mars grazer. Its orbital elements indicate that it may be an extinct comet, but it hasn&#x27;t been seen displaying cometary activity so far.

 was discovered by LINEAR in January 2000 and was soon after located by DANEOPS on Palomar plates from 10 February 1997. This allowed a reasonably precise orbit determination, and as a result it was spotted again on 27 February 2001 and 21 January 2002. When it was discovered, it beat 1995 CR&#x27;s record for both asteroid with the smallest perihelion and for Aten asteroid with the highest eccentricity.

It is estimated that &#x27;s surface temperature reaches ~920 K at perihelion, enough to melt lead and zinc, and nearly enough to melt aluminium. The asteroid would be hot enough to incandesce red being above the Draper Point at closest approach. is considered a good candidate for measuring the effects of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity because of how close it comes to the Sun.

 shares noticeable orbit similarities with two other low-perihelion asteroids: and 1995 CR, their longitude of perihelion differing by only 9.9 and 7.1 degrees, respectively. Combined with their similar semimajor axis (average distance from the Sun) of 0.877, 0.911, and 0.907 astronomical units respectively, they could possibly be fragments of that separated from it in the past.

<text>The R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is both a crucial piece of infrastructure and an architecturally acclaimed historic building named after the longtime commissioner of Toronto&#x27;s public works Roland Caldwell Harris. The plant&#x27;s architect was Thomas C. Pomphrey with engineers H.G. Acres and William Gore. It is located in the east of the city at the eastern end of Queen Street and at the foot of Victoria Park Avenue along the shore of Lake Ontario in the Beaches neighbourhood in the former city of Scarborough.

It has been the location for a number of film productions, the best known being &quot;Strange Brew&quot; (1983) with Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas.

==Roland Caldwell Harris==

Harris was born in Lansing on May 26, 1875 in what is now North York, Ontario, but grew up in Toronto. As Public Works Commissioner from 1912 to 1945, Harris was involved in such projects as:

* Crawford Street Bridge, 1914-1915, with design heavy influenced by Harris
* Prince Edward Viaduct, opened in 1918, which included his idea to add a deck under the bridge allowing for the Bloor Danforth line to be built decades later.
* Mount Pleasant bridge as part of the extension of Mount Pleasant Road north to Lawrence Avenue East in 1934.
* expansion of the streetcar network of the Toronto Civic Railways from 1912 to 1915.
* Waterfront Railway Viaduct built from 1925 to 1934 to bring rail lines into Union Station.
* extension of University Avenue south of Queen Street West to Front Street in 1931.

Harris died on September 3, 1945. His son Lieutenant Colonel Roland Allen Harris was a member of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles. Harris is buried in family plot at St. John&#x27;s Norway Cemetery.

==Site history==
===Victoria Park===
The land was once owned by Peter Patterson and was a popular spot for picnickers who nicknamed it &quot;Yellowbanks&quot; for the colour of the bluffs In 1878, Patterson leased the property to businessmen John Irwin, Bob Davies, and P.G. Close who hired John Boyle to develop and operate it as an amusement park. Buildings were erected and landscaping was done in time for it to open on June 8, 1878 as Victoria Park. Initially, the park was only accessible by water and a wharf was built to allow for steamships to bring picnickers from the Toronto Harbour at the foot of Yonge Street. The six-hectare park included a beach, with boating and canoe rentals, picnic shelters, a dance pavilion, restaurant, and an observation tower. Thomas Davies bought the park in 1886 and by 1894 the Toronto Railway Company extended streetcar lines to the park, allowing for ferry service to be discontinued. In 1899, the Toronto Railway Company took over the lease allowing it to continue as a trolley park along with nearby Munro Park which the TRC also operated. In 1906, the park was purchased by Henry Eckardt in a foreclosure sale after Davies had been unable to keep up the mortgage payments. Eckardt closed the park in 1906, the same year that nearby Munro Park closed. The traditions of both continued at Scarboro Beach Amusement Park which opened in 1907 and operated until 1925.

Victoria Park Avenue is named after the amusement park. 

From 1912 to 1932 part of the property was used for Victoria Park Forest School during the summer. The T. Eaton Company also used the property for a summer camp for boys from 1917 until 1927. In 1927, the City of Toronto purchased the property for $370,000 in order to build the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant.

===Water treatment plant===
With an early 20th-century Toronto plagued with water shortages and unclean drinking water, public health advocates such as George Nasmith and Toronto&#x27;s Medical Officer of Health, Charles Hastings, campaigned for a modern water purification system.

Construction for a water treatment plant began on the site in 1932 and the building became operational on November 1, 1941. The building, unlike most modern engineering structures, was also created to make an architectural statement. Fashioned in the Art Deco style, the cathedral-like structure remains one of Toronto&#x27;s most admired buildings. It is, however, little known to outsiders. The interiors are just as opulent with marble entryways and vast halls filled with pools of water and filtration equipment. The plant has thus earned the nickname &quot;The Palace of Purification&quot;.

In 1992, the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant was named a national historic civil engineering site by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. It was designated under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1998. The plant appeared on a stamp issued by Canada Post in 2011, in a series showcasing five notable Art Deco buildings in Canada.

==Use==

Despite its age, the plant is still fully functional, providing approximately 30% of Toronto&#x27;s water supply. The intakes are located over from shore in of water, running through two pipes under the bed of the lake. Water is also chlorinated in the plant and then pumped to various reservoirs throughout the City of Toronto and York Region.

==Access==
The facility grounds have been made available to the public. Despite some concerns of vulnerability to an attack on the water supply since the September 11 attacks, the grounds have remained open to the public, but security has been increased. In the summer of 2007, construction began on the installation of an underground Residual Management Facility allowing processed waste to be removed before discharging into the lake. This construction has since been completed.

==In popular culture==
The R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant has been used in dozens of films and television series as a prison, clinic, or headquarters.

<text>Paul William Gallico (July 26, 1897 – July 15, 1976) was an American novelist and short story and sports writer. Many of his works were adapted for motion pictures. He is perhaps best remembered for &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, his most critically successful book, for the novel &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, primarily through the 1972 film adaptation, and for four novels about the beloved character of Mrs. Harris.

==Early life and career==
Gallico was born in New York City in 1897. His father was the Italian concert pianist, composer and music teacher Paolo Gallico (Trieste, May 13, 1868 – New York, July 6, 1955), and his mother, Hortense Erlich, came from Austria; they had emigrated to New York in 1895. Gallico&#x27;s graduation from Columbia University was delayed to 1921, having served a year and a half in the United States Army during World War I. He first achieved notice in the 1920s as a sportswriter, sports columnist, and sports editor of the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;.

In 1937, in Gallico&#x27;s &quot;Farewell to Sport&quot; he stated, &quot;For all her occasional beauty and unquestioned courage, there has always been something faintly ridiculous about the big-time lady athletes.&quot; 
In the same book, Gallico later explained why he thinks Jewish people are drawn to and good at basketball, &quot;The game places a premium on an alert, scheming mind, flashy trickiness, artful dodging and general smart aleckness.&quot; 

Gallico&#x27;s career was launched by an interview with boxer Jack Dempsey in which he asked Dempsey to spar with him. Gallico described how it felt to be knocked out by the heavyweight champion. He followed up with accounts of catching Dizzy Dean&#x27;s fastball and golfing with Bobby Jones. He became one of the highest-paid sportswriters in America. His book, &quot;Lou Gehrig: Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1941) was adapted into the sports movie &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942), starring Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright.

==Career as a fiction writer==

In the late 1930s, he abandoned sports writing for fiction, first writing an essay about this decision entitled &quot;Farewell to Sport&quot; (published in an anthology of his sports writing, also titled &quot;Farewell to Sport&quot; (1938)), and became a successful writer of short stories for magazines, many appearing in the then-premier fiction outlet, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. His novella &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; and other works are expanded versions of his magazine stories.

Gallico once confessed to &quot;New York&quot; magazine: &quot;I&#x27;m a rotten novelist. I&#x27;m not even literary. I just like to tell stories and all my books tell stories... If I had lived 2,000 years ago I&#x27;d be going around to caves, and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Can I come in? I&#x27;m hungry. I&#x27;d like some supper. In exchange, I&#x27;ll tell you a story. Once upon a time there were two apes.&#x27; And I&#x27;d tell them a story about two cavemen.&quot;

In 1939, Gallico published &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot;, known for its later television adaptation with Wally Cox. It depicts the comic adventures of a modern American knight-errant visiting Europe on the verge of World War II and waging a single-handed, quixotic struggle against the Nazis in various countries. Gallico&#x27;s Austrian background is evident in the book&#x27;s strong Habsburg Monarchist theme. (The protagonist saves an Austrian princess, wins her love and takes charge of her young son – who, the book hints, is fated to become the new Habsburg Emperor once the Nazis are driven out of Austria.)

&quot;The Snow Goose&quot; was published in 1941 in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and won the O. Henry Award for short stories in 1941. Critic Robert van Gelder called it &quot;perhaps the most sentimental story that ever has achieved the dignity of a Borzoi [prestige imprint of publisher Knopf] imprint. It is a timeless legend that makes use of every timeless appeal that could be crowded into it.&quot; A public library puts it on a list of &quot;tearjerkers&quot;. Gallico made no apologies, saying that &quot;in the contest between sentiment and &#x27;slime,&#x27; &#x27;sentiment&#x27; remains so far out in front, as it always has and always will among ordinary humans that the calamity-howlers and porn merchants have to increase the decibels of their lamentations, the hideousness of their violence and the mountainous piles of their filth to keep in the race at all.&quot;

On December 25, 1949, Gallico&#x27;s short story Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; was dramatized as Attraction 66 of the NBC radio series &quot;Radio City Playhouse&quot;. It tells the humorous tale of a New York newspaper reporter and a photographer sent on a Christmas Eve wild goose chase by their publisher&#x27;s wife for two goats harnessed to a little red wagon, which she intends to give her nephews for Christmas. During a night-long search fueled by a few drinks along the way, the reporter and photographer run across the evening&#x27;s most dramatic news stories, which they must supposedly ignore in favor of the chore set out by their publisher&#x27;s wife. The radio dramatization remains very popular with Old Time Radio fans and is featured each year on Sirius XM Radio Classics.

His short story &quot;The Man Who Hated People&quot; was reworked into an unpublished short story &quot;The Seven Souls of Clement O&#x27;Reilly&quot;, adapted into the movie &quot;Lili&quot; (1953) and later staged as the musical &quot;Carnival!&quot; (1961). The film &quot;Lili&quot; is a poignant, whimsical fairy tale, the story of an orphaned waif, a naïve young woman whose fate is thrown in with that of a traveling carnival and its performers, a lothario magician and an embittered puppeteer. In 1954, Gallico published the novella &quot;The Love of Seven Dolls&quot;, based on &quot;The Man Who Hated People&quot;. The versions, while differing, share a core theme surrounding the girl and the puppeteer. The puppeteer, communicating with Lili through his puppets as a surrogate voice, develops a vehicle whereby each of them can freely express their inner pain and anguished emotions. 

In the 1950s, Gallico spent time in Liechtenstein, where he wrote &quot;Ludmila&quot;, the retelling of a local legend.

His novel &quot;Mrs. &#x27;Arris Goes to Paris&quot; (1958) was a bestseller, and became the first of four books about the lovable charwoman Mrs. &#x27;Arris. The character was said by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to be &quot;perhaps Mr. Gallico&#x27;s most beloved creation&quot;. Negotiations for film rights began as early as 1960 when he was resident in Salcombe. It was produced as a TV movie with Angela Lansbury in 1992.

During his time in Salcombe, Gallico serialised an account of the sinking of the MV &quot;Princess Victoria&quot;, the ferry that plied between Larne and Stranraer, an event which left only 44 out of 179 surviving. It was his habit, at this time, to wander in his garden dictating to his assistant Mel Menzies, who then typed the manuscript in the evening, ready for inclusion in the newspaper.

&quot;The Silent Miaow&quot; (1964) purports to be a guide written by a cat, &quot;translated from the feline&quot;, on how to obtain, captivate, and dominate a human family. Illustrated with photographs by Suzanne Szasz, it is considered a classic by cat lovers. Other Gallico cat books include &quot;Jennie&quot; (1950) (American title &quot;The Abandoned&quot;), &quot;Thomasina, the Cat Who Thought She Was God&quot; (1957), filmed in 1964 by the Walt Disney Studios as &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (which was very popular in the former USSR in the early 1990s, inspiring the Russian remake &quot;Bezumnaya Lori&quot;), and &quot;Honorable Cat&quot; (1972), a book of poetry and essays about cats.

Gallico&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, about a group of passengers attempting to escape from a capsized ocean liner, attracted little attention at the time. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a one-paragraph review, noting that &quot;Mr. Gallico collects a &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (a reference to the 1930 Vicki Baum novel) full of shipboard dossiers. These interlocking histories may be damp with sentimentality as well as brine—but the author&#x27;s skill as a storyteller invests them with enough suspense to last the desperate journey.&quot; In contrast, Irwin Allen&#x27;s motion picture adaptation of Gallico&#x27;s book instantly became a hit. In his article &quot;What makes &#x27;Poseidon&#x27; Fun?&quot;, reviewer Vincent Canby coined the term &quot;ark movie&quot; for the genre including &quot;Airport&quot;, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, and &quot;Titanic&quot; (the 1953 movie). He wrote that &quot;&#x27;The Poseidon Adventure&#x27; puts the Ark Movie back where God intended it to be, in the water. Not flying around in the air on one engine or with a hole in its side.&quot; The movie was enormously successful, part of a decade of disaster films, and remains a cult classic.

In his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, Molly Ivins said that &quot;to say that Mr. Gallico was prolific hardly begins to describe his output.&quot; He wrote 41 books and numerous short stories, 20 theatrical movies, 12 TV movies, and had a TV series based on his Hiram Holliday short stories.

==Later life==
On resigning from the &quot;Daily News&quot; to become a full-time fiction writer, Gallico moved from New York to the town of Salcombe, England. Later he lived in different regions of the world, including other parts of England, Mexico, Liechtenstein and Monaco. He spent the last part of his life in Antibes, France, and was buried there after his death from a heart attack in 1976, aged 78, which is variously reported to have happened in Antibes or Monaco.

In 1955, Gallico took an automobile tour of the United States, traveling some 10,000 miles, sponsored by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. He wrote that &quot;it had been almost twenty years since I had traveled extensively through my own country and the changes brought about by two decades would thus stand out.&quot; Several stories resulted.

==Popular culture==
In 2000, J.K. Rowling declared that Gallico&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Manxmouse&quot; was one of her favorite childhood books. The boggarts appearing in Rowling&#x27;s Harry Potter books closely resemble Manxmouse&#x27;s &quot;clutterbumph&quot;, which takes the form of whatever the viewer fears the most. &quot;Manxmouse&quot; was illustrated by Anne and Janet Grahame-Johnstone who also illustrated &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; by Dodie Smith. The Japanese animation studio Nippon Animation adapted this tale into a feature-length anime film in 1979, directed by Hiroshi Saito. The anime, titled &quot;Tondemo Nezumi Daikatsuyaku: Manxmouse&quot; (Manxmouse&#x27;s Great Activity) in Japanese, was dubbed into English in the 1980s, broadcast on Nickelodeon, and released on video by Celebrity Home Entertainment.

The television series &quot;The Adventures of Hiram Holliday&quot; (starring Wally Cox) was adapted from a series of Gallico&#x27;s stories about a newspaper proofreader who had many adventures dealing with Nazis and spies in Europe on the eve of World War II.

In Fredric Brown&#x27;s science-fiction novel &quot;What Mad Universe&quot;, a magazine editor from our own world is accidentally sent to a parallel Earth significantly different from ours; in this parallel world, the editor reads a biography written of a dashing space hero, a figure central to the novel&#x27;s narrative, which is supposedly written by Paul Gallico.

In 1975, the British progressive rock band Camel released an album of work based on Gallico&#x27;s &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;. Although the author was initially opposed to the album&#x27;s release, legal action was evaded on the condition that the band used the words &quot;Music Inspired by The Snow Goose&quot; on the album&#x27;s cover.

In 2005, a televised disaster film titled &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, which was a remake of the movie inspired by Gallico&#x27;s novel, was aired; the Captain, played by Peter Weller, is named after Gallico.

<text>Scenography is the practice of crafting stage environments or atmospheres. In the contemporary English usage, scenography can be defined as the combination of technological and material stagecrafts to represent, enact, and produce a sense of place in performance. 

While inclusive of the techniques of scenic design and set design, scenography is a holistic approach to the study and practice of all aspects of design in performance. It also includes the design of lighting, sound, and costumes.

==Etymology and cultural interpretations==
The term scenography is of Greek origin (&quot;skēnē&quot;, meaning &#x27;stage or scene building&#x27;; &quot;grapho&quot;, meaning &#x27;to describe&#x27;) originally detailed within Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; as &#x27;skenographia&#x27;. Nevertheless, within continental Europe, the term has been closely aligned with the professional practice of scénographie and is synonymous with the English-language term &#x27;theatre design&#x27;. More recently, the term has been used in museography with regards to the curation of museum exhibits.

==History==
In what is not the first use of the term, Antonio Caimi, in 1862, describes a category of artists practising &quot;pittura scenica e l&#x27;architettura teatrale&quot;, inspired by the artist Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena, who was also known as a painter of quadratura, or architectural painting (usually trompe-l&#x27;œil depictions of architecture on ceilings or walls). Caimi also calls this &quot;Arte scenografica&quot;, and notes that it required ingenious engineering to create movable sets, or create illusions of environments. The Galli da Bibiena family was a pedigree of scenographic artistry that emerged in late-seventeenth-century Bologna, but spread throughout northern Italy to Austria and Germany. Another large family known for theatrical scenography were members of the Quaglio surname.

Caimi goes on to mention practitioners of scenography in the second half of the 18th century and early 19th century in Lombardy, including: Bernardino Galliari, Gaspare Galliari, Pasquale Canna, Pietro Gonzaga, Paolo Landriani, Giovanni Perego, Alessandro Sanquirico, Bomenico Menozzi, Carlo Fontana, Baldassare Cavallotti, Carlo Ferrari, Filippo Peroni, Carlo Ferrario, Enrico Rovecchi, Angelo Moja, Luigi Vimercati, and the brothers Mofta of Modena, among others. A review of the history of Italian-influenced scenic painting, architecture, and design up to the nineteenth century, was provided by Landriani.

==Usage==
While also aligned with the professional practice of the scenographer, it is important to distinguish the individual elements that comprise the &#x27;design&#x27; of a performance event (such as light, environment, costume, etc.) from the term &#x27;scenography&#x27;, which is an artistic perspective concerning the visual, experiential, and spatial composition of performance. Influenced by the work of Modernist pioneers Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, scenography proposes that design practices within performance are considered an equal partner, alongside other elements such as literary texts and performance technique, within the construction and reception of meaning. The practice of scenography is thereby a holistic approach to the composition of performance and can be applied to the design or curation of events within, and outside of, the conventional theatre environment. Or, as Pamela Howard states in her book &quot;What is Scenography?&quot;:

:&quot;Scenography is the seamless synthesis of space, text, research, art, actors, directors and spectators that contributes to an original creation.&quot;

Joslin McKinney and Philip Butterworth expand upon this to suggest that:

:&quot;Scenography is not simply concerned with creating and presenting images to an audience; it is concerned with audience reception and engagement. It is a sensory as well as an intellectual experience, emotional as well as rational.&quot;

==Scenographic theory==
While there is no one theory of scenography, Rachel Hann has argued for a distinction between &#x27;scenography&#x27; and &#x27;scenographics&#x27;. Hann introduces this framework by plotting the usage of key terminologies:

:&quot;As part of this differentiation, I approach a scenographic trait as &quot;orientating&quot; and scenography as a &quot;crafting&quot;. My intention is to map how these evidently related concepts apply to artistic and social scenarios beyond institutional conceptions of theatre. I attempt to dissuade the reader from understanding notions of scenographic as singular and monolithic. My adoption of scenographics stresses the inherent plurality and multiplicities that sustain a scenographic encounter. Consequently, scenographic traits result from a combination of orientating stimuli that exceed strict ontologies of empiricism and complicate the neat separation of theatrical crafts.&quot;

Scenographics are a collection of place-orienting traits that are often explicit in theatre, yet are also present within other scenographic cultures such as gardening and visual merchandising. These traits draw attention to &quot;orders of world&quot; by employing methods that sculpt or irritate how distinct worlding orientations (whether that of materiality and texture, familiarity and proximity, as well as ideologies of nation and identity) sit together as part of a broader geography. Hann consolidates this position by arguing that to &quot;speak of staging is to speak of how scenographics enact an &#x27;othering&#x27; of place&quot;. Scenographics are &quot;interventional acts of orientation that complicate, reveal or score processes of worlding&quot;.

This approach positions scenography as a &quot;crafting of place orientation&quot; and a theatre-making strategy, alongside dramaturgy and choreography. The usage of place orientation as the loci for scenography seeks to capture an understanding that is inclusive of the physical as well as metaphysical relations that affect how individuals design and experience the assemblage of place. This could be the role of directed sound systems in cultivating a feeling of isolation; the usage of a tightly focused lantern to re-orientate the spatial dimensions of a place; the scent of an old well-worn desk; along with how costumes mould relations between bodies and stage environments. In practice, Hann argues that it is the interrelations between these distinct methods of scenography (costume, scenery, light, sound) that give rise to an act of scenography, where &quot;scenography is neither exclusively visual nor spatial&quot; 

Lastly, Hann proposes that scenographics are formative to all staged atmospheres by arguing that there &quot;are no stages without scenographics&quot;. This is based on the argument that &quot;all stages are also scenes&quot; that challenges the &quot;deterministic assumption that stages precede scenography&quot;. In this model, stages become manifest through the place-orienting traits of scenographics (rather than the other way around). The implications of this are that all theatre is scenographic - even if it has no defined objects or &#x27;setting&#x27; - as all theatre is performed on a stage. Hann summarises this position by using the hybrid &#x27;stage-scene&#x27; when discussing the tensions between the histories of these practices, particularly with reference to original Greek &quot;&quot; as a physical tent or hut that ultimately shaped current conceptualizations of &#x27;the stage&#x27;.

<text>Ragtime is a novel by E. L. Doctorow, first published in 1975. The sweeping historical fiction occurs in the area of New York City between 1902 and 1915.

&quot;Ragtime&quot; was ranked number 86 among Modern Library&#x27;s 100 Best Novels in 1998. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Ragtime&quot; in its list of 100 Best English-Language Novels from 1923 to 2005.

==Plot==
The novel centers on a wealthy family living in New Rochelle, New York, referred to as Father, Mother, Mother&#x27;s Younger Brother, Grandfather, and &#x27;the little boy&#x27;, Father and Mother&#x27;s young son. The family business is the manufacture of flags and fireworks, an easy source of wealth due to the national enthusiasm for patriotic displays. Father joins Robert Peary&#x27;s expedition to the North Pole, and his return sees a change in his relationship with his wife, who has experienced independence in his absence. Mother&#x27;s Younger Brother is a genius at explosives and fireworks but is an insecure, unhappy character who chases after love and excitement. He becomes obsessed with the notorious socialite Evelyn Nesbit, stalking her and embarking on a brief, unsatisfactory affair with her.

Into this insecure setup comes an abandoned black child, then his severely depressed mother, Sarah. Coalhouse Walker Jr., the child&#x27;s father, visits regularly to win Sarah&#x27;s affections. A professional musician, well-dressed and well-spoken, he gains the family&#x27;s respect and overcomes their prejudice initially by playing ragtime music on their piano. Things go well until he is humiliated by a racist fire crew, led by Will Conklin, who vandalize his Model T Ford. He begins a pursuit of redress by legal action but discovers he cannot hope to win because of the inherent prejudice of the system. Sarah is killed in an attempt to aid him, and Coalhouse uses the money he was saving for their wedding to pay for an extravagant funeral. 

Having exhausted legal resources, Coalhouse begins killing firemen and bombing firehouses to force the city to meet his demands: that his Model T be restored to its original condition and Conklin be turned over to him for justice. Mother unofficially adopts Sarah and Coalhouse&#x27;s neglected child over Father&#x27;s objections, putting strain on their marriage. With a group of angry young men, all of whom refer to themselves as &quot;Coalhouse Walker&quot;, Coalhouse continues his vigilante campaign and is joined by Younger Brother, who brings his knowledge of explosives. Coalhouse and his gang storm the Morgan Library, taking the priceless collection hostage and wiring the building with dynamite. Father is drawn into the escalating conflict as a mediator, as is Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse agrees to exchange Conklin&#x27;s life for safe passage for his men, who leave in his restored Model T. Coalhouse is shot as he surrenders to the authorities.

Interwoven with this story is a depiction of life in the tenement slums of New York city, focused on an Eastern European immigrant referred to as Tateh, who struggles to support himself and his daughter after driving her mother off for accepting money for sex with her employer. The girl&#x27;s beauty attracts the attention of Evelyn Nesbit, who provides financial support. When Tateh learns who Nesbit really is, however, he takes his daughter out of the city. 

Tateh is a talented artist and earns a living cutting out novelty paper silhouettes on the street. He tries working in a factory, where he experiences a successful workers&#x27; strike, but becomes disillusioned when he sees it change little about the workers&#x27; lives, although in the final chapter he still describes himself as a socialist. He starts making and selling moving picture books to a novelty toy company, becoming a pioneer of animation in the motion picture industry. Tateh becomes wealthy and styles himself &quot;the Baron&quot; in order to move more easily through high society. He meets and falls in love with Mother, who marries him after Father is killed in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. They adopt each other&#x27;s children, as well as Coalhouse&#x27;s son, and move to California.

Mixed into the interwoven stories are subplots following prominent figures of the day, including those named above as well as in the Historical figures section below.

== Historical figures ==

The novel is unusual for the irreverent way that historical figures and fictional characters are woven into the narrative, making for surprising connections and linking different events and trains of thought about fame and success, on the one hand, and poverty and racism on the other. One such figure is the black moderate politician Booker T. Washington, who tries to negotiate with Coalhouse Walker without success.

Harry Houdini plays an incidental yet prominent part, reflecting on success and mortality. As his success grows, he becomes increasingly depressed and believes his work is ultimately meaningless. After his mother&#x27;s death, he becomes obsessed with exposing fraudulent occultism, while secretly longing to find a true mystic experience.

Arch-capitalist financier J. P. Morgan, pursuing his complex delusions of grandeur, becomes obsessed with reincarnation and Egyptian mysticism, and finds an unexpected kindred spirit in the down-to-earth Henry Ford. Traveling to Egypt hoping for a vision of his grand destiny, Morgan only dreams of a past life as an ordinary peddler. 

Socialite Evelyn Nesbit, desperate to escape the press, becomes involved with Tateh and takes it on herself to care for his daughter. On meeting the anarchist agitator Emma Goldman her identity is exposed and Tateh leaves her. Emma gives Evelyn comfort and guidance on how to free herself from the domination of men. Later, Younger Brother encounters Goldman, who advises him to move beyond his obsession with Evelyn. 

Other historical characters mentioned include 
* the polar explorer Robert Peary and his black assistant Matthew Henson
* the architect Stanford White
* Nesbit&#x27;s mentally unbalanced husband Harry Kendall Thaw, who murdered White for allegedly sexually assaulting Nesbit when she was 15
* Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
* Countess Sophie Chotek
* Sigmund Freud, who rides the Tunnel of Love at Coney Island with Carl Jung
* Theodore Dreiser
* Jacob Riis
* the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, with whom Younger Brother eventually joins forces. 

Two real-life New York City officials also appear in the book: Manhattan District Attorney Charles S. Whitman and Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo.

==Influences==
The name Coalhouse Walker is a reference to the 1811 German novella &quot;Michael Kohlhaas&quot; by Heinrich von Kleist. Doctorow called &quot;Ragtime&quot; a &quot;quite deliberate &quot;hommage&quot;&quot; to Kleist&#x27;s story. The elements involving Coalhouse&#x27;s humiliation and his increasingly desperate search for a dignified resolution reflect plot details in Kleist.

==Recognition==
The novel was a nominee for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1975, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in 1976.

The 1991 Fredric Jameson book &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; considers Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot; to illustrate the crisis of historiography and a resistance to interpretation.

==Adaptations ==
The novel was adapted for an eponymous 1981 movie and 1998 musical.

<doc id="854425" wikidata="Q7643701" url="?curid=854425" title="Superkart">
<text>Superkart is a form of motorsport road racing that uses karts on long circuits. The bigger difference between a superkart and most other forms of kart is that they have full aerodynamic bodykits, as well as having a longer wheel base than sprint chassis, and are generally raced on car circuits over 1,500 metres in length. The power unit, most often but not exclusively two-stroke 250 cc engines, can be specially designed kart engines or production motorcycle engines with either five- or six-speed sequential manual gearboxes. Owing to their high top speed and superb cornering ability, a superkart&#x27;s aerodynamic bodywork includes a front fairing, larger sidepods, and a rear wing. They use either tires and wheels and most often race on full size auto-racing circuits.

The 250 cc superkarts can set faster lap times than much more expensive and technically advanced racing machines. Some British and Australian classes also include 125 cc gearbox karts. Superkarts race on &quot;long circuits&quot; (e.g. Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Magny-Cours). In the UK they also race on &quot;short circuits&quot; (e.g. Kimbolton); &quot;short circuits&quot; are under 1,500 metres in length. Superkarts are raced worldwide. There is a multi-event CIK-FIA European Superkart Championship (for 250 cc karts only), and there has in the past been a world championship, which was last run in 1995.

==Performance==
Powered by a two-stroke 250 cc engine producing for an overall weight including the driver of 205 kilograms (452 lb), superkarts have a power/weight ratio (including the driver) of approximately 365 W/kg (490 hp/tonne)(0.22 hp/lb), or closer to 730 W/kg (980 hp/tonne)(0.44 hp/lb) without the driver, which is about the equivalent of a midget car, or an open-wheel A1 Grand Prix car. Superkarts can accelerate from 0 to in less than 3 seconds with a top speed of . Their low weight and good downforce make for excellent cornering and braking abilities. A superkart is capable of braking from to standstill in around 2 seconds, and taking corners at nearly 3 &quot;&quot;g&quot;&quot; (30 m/s²).
British superkart divisions :

*&quot;Division 1&quot; is open to 250 cc twin cylinder engines with five or six speed gearboxes. Typically the karts produce and are capable of - the fastest form of kart. This formula was previously known as &quot;Formula E&quot;, which was changed to avoid confusion with the Formula E series.
*&quot;250 National&quot; is for single cylinder karts with five- and six-speed boxes. Typically these karts produce and are capable of . However, being lighter than the twin cylinder (Division 1) karts they can be as quick on twisty circuits. This formula was previously known as &quot;250 International&quot;. 
*&quot;125 Open&quot; - Powered by 125 cc engines producing and featuring six-speed sequential gearboxes, this class uses lighter chassis than the 250s and are the most agile of long circuit superkarts, they are capable of .

Australian superkart divisions :
Superkart racing in Australia has, since 1989, referred to any form of racing kart to race on full-size motor racing circuits, usually as sanctioned by the Australian ASN, CAMS.
*&quot;250 cc International&quot; - commonly referred to as &quot;twins&quot; or &quot;inters&quot;, these karts are powered by twin cylinder engines and usually have six-speed sequential gearboxes. Several European and North American chassis are popular in addition to locally developed designs.
*&quot;250 cc National&quot; - single cylinder class, the 250 National class is powered by 250 cc motocross engines and also feature six-speed sequential gearboxes.
*125 cc Gearbox - most often powered by 125 cc Honda and Yamaha Grand Prix motorcycle engines equipped with six-speed sequential gearboxes, this superkart class uses mostly the same chassis as the 250 classes. They run at lighter weights than the 250 classes, which makes for close racing with mid-field 250 Nationals at some circuits.
*80 cc Gearbox - also dominated by Honda and Yamaha motor cycle engines, 80 cc Gearbox is no longer a sanctioned class in Australian racing. Some 80 cc karts were noticeably smaller than 125/250 cc gearbox karts, with &quot;laydown&quot;-style karts, where the driver lies flat in the kart rather than sitting upright, proliferating. Last contested at the national level in 2005. and state level in 2008, some 80 cc karts survive racing in the 125 cc division at state level, but are uncompetitive as they no longer run at lighter homologated weight levels.
*&quot;125 cc Rotax Max&quot; - a cross-over class from Australian short-circuit non-gearbox sprint kart racing to allow easier and cheaper graduation from sprint kart racing to long circuit racing. Three national championships exist for two weight divisions, &quot;Heavy&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;, and also sometimes a &quot;Junior&quot; division for drivers under the age of sixteen which run a version of the Rotax Max engine without a power valve. Rotax Max karts frequently race amongst gearbox-equipped superkarts at the state championship level, while racing for their own titles at the national level.
*&quot;100 cc&quot; - another non-gearbox class, 100 cc also was split into Heavy, Light and Junior classes, was last contested in 2002 and has since been replaced completely by Rotax Max.

United States superkart classes:
*&quot;250 cc Formula/E&quot; or &quot;F/E&quot; - Twin cylinder, six-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines such as the Honda RS250, Yamaha TZ250 or made for kart racing engines such as the BRC250.
*&quot;250 cc Inter-Continental E&quot; or &quot;IC/E&quot; - Single cylinder, five- or six-speed, liquid cooled Grand Prix motorcycle engines.

==Spectacle==

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; reports that superkarts cost between $15,000 to US$20,000 in 2005. Entries of 60 or more are common in Britain. Overtaking tends to be easy, as there is room to get past, so the races tend to be full of action. Race lengths tend to be around 20–25 miles (30–40 km), because the fuel tanks are quite small, so at most meetings that feature superkarts, the karts race is often a brief, spectacular highlight (U.S. superkart races are timed 30-minute races; pre-final on Saturday, final on Sunday).

A global category, superkarts are endorsed by the FIA, and were featured as a support category to the French Formula 1 Grand Prix at Magny-Cours in 2007 where they bettered Porsche Supercup lap times.

<text>Lord Jim is a novel by Joseph Conrad originally published as a serial in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from October 1899 to November 1900. An early and primary event in the story is the abandonment of a passenger ship in distress by its crew, including a young British seaman named Jim. He is publicly censured for this action and the novel follows his later attempts at coming to terms with himself and his past and seeking redemption and acceptance.

In 1998 the Modern Library ranked &quot;Lord Jim&quot; 85th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Plot summary==
Recovering from an injury, Jim seeks a position on the , a steamer serving the transport of 800 &quot;pilgrims of an exacting belief&quot; to a port on the Red Sea. He is hired as first mate. After some days of smooth sailing, the ship hits something in the night and the bulkhead begins bulging under the waterline. Captain Gustav thinks the ship will quickly sink, and Jim agrees but wants to put the passengers on the few boats before that can happen. The captain and two other crewmen think only to save themselves, and prepare to lower a boat. The helmsmen remain, as no order has been given to do otherwise. In a crucial moment, Jim jumps into the boat with the captain. A few days later, they are picked up by an outbound steamer. When they reach port, they learn that the &quot;Patna&quot; and its passengers were brought in safely by a crew from a French navy ship. The captain&#x27;s actions in abandoning both ship and passengers are against the code of the sea, and the crew is publicly vilified. When the other men leave town before the magistrate&#x27;s court can be convened, Jim is the only crew member left to testify. All lose their certificates to sail. Brierly, a captain of perfect reputation who is on the panel of the court, inexplicably commits suicide days after the trial.

Captain Charles Marlow attends the trial and meets Jim, whose behaviour he condemns, but the young man intrigues him. Wracked with guilt, Jim confesses his shame to Marlow, who finds him a place to live in a friend&#x27;s home. Jim is accepted there but leaves abruptly when an engineer who had also abandoned the ship appears to work at the house. Jim then finds work as a ship chandler&#x27;s clerk in ports of the East Indies, always succeeding in the job then leaving abruptly when the memory of the &quot;Patna&quot; incident catches up with him. In Bangkok, he gets in a fistfight. Marlow realises that Jim needs a new situation, something that will take him far away from modern ports and keep him occupied so that he can finally forget his guilt. Marlow consults his friend Stein, who sees that Jim is a romantic and considers his situation. Stein offers Jim to be his trade representative or factor in Patusan, a village on a remote island shut off from most commerce, which Jim finds to be exactly what he needs.

After his initial challenge of entering the settlement of native Malay and Bugis people, Jim manages to earn their respect by relieving them of the depredations of the bandit Sherif Ali and protecting them from the corrupt local Malay chief, Rajah Tunku Allang. He builds a solid link with Doramin, the Bugis friend of Stein, and his son Dain Waris. For his leadership, the people call him &quot;Tuan Jim&quot;, or Lord Jim. Jim also wins the love of Jewel, a young woman of mixed race, and is &quot;satisfied... nearly.&quot; Marlow visits Patusan once, two years after Jim arrived there, and sees his success. Jewel does not believe that Jim will stay, as her father left her mother, and she is not reassured that Marlow or any other outsider will not arrive to take him from her. Her mother had been married before her death to Cornelius, previously given the factor&#x27;s role by Stein for her benefit. Cornelius is a lazy, jealous, and brutal man who treats his stepdaughter cruelly and steals the supplies Stein sends for sale; he is displaced by Jim&#x27;s arrival and resents him for it.

&quot;Gentleman&quot; Brown, a marauding captain notorious for his evil ways, then sails into Patusan, his small crew on the brink of starvation. The local defence led by Dain Waris manages to prevent the marauders from looting the village and holds them entrenched in place while Jim is away in the island&#x27;s interior. When Jim returns, Brown deceptively wins Jim&#x27;s mercy, who hesitantly negotiates to allow them to leave Patusan unobstructed, but reminds Brown that the long passage down river to the sea will be guarded by armed men. Cornelius sees his chance to get rid of Jim. He tells Brown of a side channel that will bypass most of the defenses, which Brown navigates, stopping briefly to ambush the defenders he finds out of revenge. Dain Waris is killed, among others, and Brown sails on, leaving Cornelius behind. Jim&#x27;s man Tamb&#x27; Itam kills Cornelius for his betrayal. Jim is mortified when he receives word of the death of his good friend Waris. He resigns himself to his earlier commitment that no villagers would be harmed and chooses not to flee. Jewel, who had wanted Jim to attack Brown and his ship, is distraught and begs him to defend himself and never leave her. Jim then goes directly to Doramin and in front of the village takes responsibility for the death of his only son. Devastated, Doramin uses his flintlock pistols, given him by Stein, to execute Jim by shooting him in the chest.

On his regular route, Marlow arrives at Stein&#x27;s house a few days after this event, finding Jewel and Tamb&#x27; Itam there, and tries to make sense of what happened. Jewel stays under the protection of Stein, who presages his own death.

==Characters==
*Marlow: A sea captain in the Merchant Navy who helps Jim after his fall from grace, trying to understand how &quot;one of us&quot; could lack the bravery and judgment expected of seamen. Marlow is also the narrator of three of Conrad&#x27;s other works: &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Youth&quot;, and &quot;Chance&quot;.
*Jim: Young parson&#x27;s son who takes to the sea, training for the merchant service as steam ships mix with sailing ships. He dreams of heroic deeds. He is a strong, tall, blond Englishman whose life is the story told by Marlow.
*Captain Gustav: Captain of the &quot;Patna&quot;, an Australian born in Germany, who is interested in the money made from this ship, with no concern for his honour as a captain. He is a man of huge girth. He orders the engineers to free a boat for them to leave the ship. After learning ashore that the ship came in ahead of them, he knows his certificate will be cancelled and he leaves, never seen again.
*Ship&#x27;s engineers: Three men who keep the steam boiler working; one is George, who dies of a heart attack on the &quot;Patna&quot; as the others leave the ship. Another shows up later by chance at the same place where Jim is living, driving Jim away. The third becomes completely drunk, left in the hospital.
*Montague Brierly: Captain in the merchant service with a perfect reputation. He sits in the court that hears the case of the &quot;Patna&quot; crew, telling Marlow that Jim ought to hide somewhere, as he can never work as a seaman again. A few days after the trial, this superior man (&quot;indeed, had you been Emperor of East and West, you could not have ignored your inferiority in his presence&quot;, Chapter 6) kills himself by jumping off his ship at sea, leaving no explanation.
*Stein: Head of Stein &amp; Co., friend of Marlow, and a man with a long, interesting life. He has had success in trade in the East, collecting produce from various ports in the Dutch colonial areas and settling far from his native Bavaria after losing in the uprisings of 1848. He learned lepidopterology, which became his passionate hobby, gaining him a reputation for all the specimens he sent to contacts in Europe in this age of scientific discovery. He was married and had a child, both lost to him by disease. He understands Jim&#x27;s temperament instantly.
*Jewel: Daughter of a Dutch-Malay woman and a white European man, never named, who deserted them. Her stepfather is Cornelius. Her mother died a year or two before she meets Jim.
*Cornelius: Former factor for Stein &amp; Co., on account of his wife, whom Stein admired. He is a lazy man of no morals, and brutal. He is Malacca Portuguese. When replaced by Jim, he does not leave the area, nor does he find any useful occupation for himself. He connives with the marauder Brown to kill Jim, succeeding indirectly after Brown&#x27;s men kill Dain Waris. Cornelius is killed by Tamb&#x27; Itam, who sees him after the attack and realizes the role he played.
*De Jongh: Friend to Marlow, and the last of the ship&#x27;s chandlers who accepts Jim on Marlow&#x27;s recommendation.
*Doramin: Old chief of the Bugis people in Patusan and father of Dain Waris, his only son. He was a friend to Stein, and the two exchanged gifts on parting: Doramin gave a ring to Stein, and Stein gave pistols to Doramin. He becomes an ally to Jim.
*Dain Waris: The only son of Doramin; a young, strong, and fiercely devoted leader of his people. He becomes fast friends with Jim.
*Sherif Ali: Local bandit who is a trial to all others in Patusan, extorting fees and stealing crops and resources from others. He is defeated by Jim, but not killed.
*Rajah Tunku Allang: Malay chief in Patusan who took Jim prisoner on his first entry into the country. Jim escapes, starting life there on his own terms.
*Tamb&#x27; Itam: Malay servant and loyal bodyguard to Jim.
*Gentleman Brown: A cruel captain of a latter-day pirate crew, who kills because he can, and is not a success in life. He has a ship in poor condition and a crew of men similar to him when he runs short of food near Patusan. He goes up the river to the village, which successfully forces him to retreat to a nearby hilltop. On leaving, Brown orders a vengeful attack on Patusan&#x27;s defenders, killing Dain Waris, which leads to the end of Jim&#x27;s life. Marlow meets an ailing Brown in Bangkok just before his death, and hears the story of the encounter from Brown&#x27;s viewpoint.

==Allusions to historical events==
The opening event in &quot;Lord Jim&quot; has been speculated by historians to have been based in part on an actual abandonment of a ship. On 17 July 1880 the British merchantman SS &quot;Jeddah&quot; set sail from Singapore bound for Penang and Jeddah, with 778 men, 147 women, and 67 children on board. The passengers were Muslims from the Malay states and were travelling to Mecca for the &quot;hajj&quot; (holy pilgrimage). After rough weather conditions, the &quot;Jeddah&quot; began taking on water. The hull sprang a large leak, the water rose rapidly, and the captain and officers abandoned the heavily listing ship. They were picked up by another vessel and taken to Aden, where they claimed that the passengers had attacked two engineers and the ship had foundered in poor weather. The pilgrims were abandoned by the crew. However, on 8 August 1880, a French steamship towed &quot;Jeddah&quot; into Aden and the pilgrims on board survived the incident. An official inquiry followed, as in the novel.

The inspiration for the character of Jim was the chief mate of the &quot;Jeddah&quot;, &quot;Austin&quot; Podmore Williams, whose grave was tracked down to Singapore&#x27;s Bidadari Cemetery by Gavin Young in his book &quot;In Search of Conrad&quot;. As in the novel, Williams created a new life for himself, returning to Singapore and becoming a successful ship&#x27;s chandler.

Conrad may also have been influenced by the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s 1869 account of his travels and of the native peoples of the islands of Southeast Asia, &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot;; the character Stein is based on Wallace. The second part of the novel is based in some part on the life of James Brooke, the first Rajah of Sarawak – as Conrad himself says in his letter to Margaret Brooke: &quot;The book (Lord Jim) which has found favour in your eyes has been inspired in great measure by the history of the first Rajah&#x27;s enterprise...&quot;.
Brooke was an Indian-born English adventurer who in the 1840s managed to gain power and set up an independent state in Sarawak, on the island of Borneo. Some critics, however, think that the fictional Patusan was intended not to be part of Borneo but of Sumatra.

==Recognition==
In 1998 the Modern Library Board ranked &quot;Lord Jim&quot; 85th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 1999, the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; conducted a contest among readers to rank which of 200 novels of the 20th century they remembered best. Seventeen thousand responses yielded the final list, which placed &quot;Lord Jim&quot; at number 75. The complete list is found in Le Monde&#x27;s 100 Books of the Century in English, and also in French Wikipedia.

==Critical interpretation==
The novel is in two main parts, firstly Jim&#x27;s lapse aboard the &quot;Patna&quot; and his consequent fall, and secondly an adventure story about Jim&#x27;s rise and the tale&#x27;s climax in the fictional town of Patusan, presumed a part of the Indonesian archipelago. The main themes surround young Jim&#x27;s potential (&quot;he was one of us&quot;, says Marlow, the narrator) thus sharpening the drama and tragedy of his fall, his subsequent struggle to redeem himself, and Conrad&#x27;s further hints that personal character flaws will almost certainly emerge given an appropriate catalyst. Conrad, speaking through his character Stein, called Jim a romantic figure, and indeed &quot;Lord Jim&quot; is arguably Conrad&#x27;s most romantic novel.

In addition to the lyricism of Conrad&#x27;s descriptive writing, the novel is noted for its sophisticated structure. The bulk of the novel is told in the form of a story recited by the character Marlow to a group of listeners, and the conclusion is presented in the form of a letter from Marlow. Within Marlow&#x27;s narration, other characters also tell their own stories in nested dialogue. Thus, events in the novel are described from several viewpoints, and often out of chronological order.

The reader is left to form an impression of Jim&#x27;s interior psychological state from these multiple external points of view. Some critics (using deconstruction) contend that this is impossible and that Jim must forever remain an enigma, whereas others argue that there is an absolute reality the reader can perceive and that Jim&#x27;s actions may be ethically judged.

There is also an analysis that shows in the novel a fixed pattern of meaning and an implicit unity that Conrad said the novel has. As he wrote to his publisher four days after completing &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, it is &quot;the development of one situation, only one really, from beginning to end.&quot; A metaphysical question pervades the novel and helps unify it: whether the &quot;destructive element&quot; that is the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Universe has intention—and, beyond that, malevolent intention—toward any particular individual or is, instead, indiscriminate, impartial, and indifferent. Depending (as a corollary) on the answer to that question is the degree to which the particular individual can be judged responsible for what he does or does not do; and various responses to the question or its corollary are provided by the several characters and voices in the novel.

The omniscient narrator of the first part remarks of the trial: &quot;They wanted facts. Facts! They demanded facts from him, as if facts could explain anything!&quot; Ultimately, Jim remains mysterious, as seen through a mist: &quot;that mist in which he loomed interesting if not very big, with floating outlines – a straggler yearning inconsolably for his humble place in the ranks... It is when we try to grapple with another man&#x27;s intimate need that we perceive how incomprehensible, wavering, and misty are the beings that share with us the sight of the stars and the warmth of the sun.&quot; It is only through Marlow&#x27;s recitation that Jim lives for us – the relationship between the two men incites Marlow to &quot;tell you the story, to try to hand over to you, as it were, its very existence, its reality – the truth disclosed in a moment of illusion.&quot;

Postcolonial interpretations of the novel, while not as intensive as that of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, point to similar themes in the two novels – the protagonist sees himself as part of a &quot;civilising mission&quot; and the story involves a &quot;heroic adventure&quot; during the apogee of the New Imperialism era. Conrad&#x27;s use of a protagonist with a dubious history has been interpreted as an expression of his increasing doubts with regard to positive benefits of colonialism; literary critic Elleke Boehmer sees the novel, along with &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, as part of a growing suspicion that &quot;a primitive and demoralising other&quot; is present within the governing order of the day.

==Comics adaptations==
George Evans adapted the novel into a comic book in the 1950s.

==Radio adaptations==
The book has been adapted in 6 parts for BBC Radio:
*&quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1985), directed by Keith Darville.

==Film adaptations==

*&quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1925), directed by Victor Fleming.
*&quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1965), directed by Richard Brooks and starring Peter O&#x27;Toole as Jim.

The 1979 Hindi film &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; has strong traces of &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, with Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of an ex-Merchant Navy captain who struggles to overcome his guilt of having abandoned a ship and risked the lives of passengers, and turns into a coal-mine worker.

<text>Frans Floris, Frans Floris the Elder or Frans Floris de Vriendt (17 April 15191 October 1570) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman, print artist and tapestry designer. He is mainly known for his history paintings, allegorical scenes and portraits. He played an important role in the movement in Northern Renaissance painting referred to as Romanism. The Romanists had typically travelled to Italy to study the works of leading Italian High Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, Raphael and their followers. Their art assimilated these Italian influences into the Northern painting tradition.

After returning from travels in Italy in 1545, he became a leading painter in his native Antwerp, then at the height of its prosperity. Large numbers of his works for churches were destroyed in the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; of 1566. 

==Life==
Frans Floris was born in Antwerp. He was the scion of a prominent artist family which originally went with the name ‘de Vriendt’. The earliest known ancestors of the Floris de Vriendt family, then still called only ‘de Vriendt’, were residents of Brussels where they practiced the craft of stonemason and stonecutter which was passed on from father to son. One of Frans&#x27; ancestors became in 1406 a master of the Brussels stonemasons guild. A family member, Jan Florisz. de Vriendt, left his native Brussels and settled in Antwerp in the mid-15th century. His patronymic name ‘Floris’ became the common family name in subsequent generations. The original form ‘de Vriendt’ can, however, still be found in official documents until the late 16th century.

Frans&#x27; brothers were prominent artists. The most famous one is Cornelis who was an architect and sculptor and was one of the designers of the Antwerp City Hall. Jacob Floris was a painter of stained-glass windows and Jan Floris was a potter. Jan traveled to Spain to practice his art there and died young. 
Documentary evidence about the life of Frans Floris is scarce. Most of what we know about the youth and training of Frans Floris is based on the early biographer Karel van Mander&#x27;s biography of the artist. At ten pages long it is one of the most detailed biographies in van Mander&#x27;s &quot;Het Schilder-boeck&quot; published in 1604. According to van Mander, Frans Floris was the son of the stonecutter Cornelis I de Vriendt (died 1538). Like his brothers, Frans began as a student of sculpture, but later he gave up sculpture for painting. Floris went to Liège where he studied with the prominent painter Lambert Lombard. The choice for Lombard as a teacher was surprising since Antwerp was a cultural centre with many outstanding painters. He may have chosen Lombard as his brother Cornelis was good friends with Lombard, whom he had met in Rome around 1538. It is also possible that Frans trained as a painter in Antwerp before studying under Lombard. Floris became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1539–40.

Lombard encouraged Frans Floris to study in Italy. He traveled to Rome probably as early as 1541 or 1542 and became fascinated with Italian contemporary painting (particularly Michelangelo and Raphael) and the Classical sculpture and art of Rome. He kept a notebook of sketches, which his pupils would later etch. Floris visited other cities in Italy including Mantua and Genoa.
Upon his return to Antwerp around 1545, Frans Floris opened a workshop on the Italian model. He became the leading history painter and was called the ‘Flemish Raphael’. He enjoyed the patronage of prominent personalities such as the wealthy Antwerp banker Niclaes Jonghelinck for whose house he painted a series of ten compositions on the legend of Hercules and seven compositions on the liberal arts. He also painted 14 large panels for the duke of Aarschot&#x27;s palace of Beaumont. Local nobility including the knights of the Golden Fleece, the Prince of Orange and the Counts of Egmont and Horn (later the leaders of the Dutch Revolt) visited Floris at his home, attracted by his artistic reputation as well as his ability to talk with ‘great insight and judgment on any topic’. He also moved in the circle of the leading humanists such as Abraham Ortelius, Christophe Plantin, Lucas de Heere, Lambert Lombard, Dominicus Lampsonius and Hieronymus Cock. This group of intellectuals and artists was the first to develop theories on art and the role of artists in the Low Countries. In 1549 Floris was commissioned by the Antwerp city authorities to design the decorations for the Joyous entry into Antwerp of Charles V of Spain and the Infante Philip.
His brother Cornelis designed a palace for him in Antwerp with a façade of blue limestone and with luxurious decorations such as gilded leather wall-coverings in the bedroom. The façade itself was designed by Frans. His design program for the façade was intended to illustrate the high status of artists in society. He painted the façade with seven personifications symbolizing the qualities and skills of an artist: Accuracy (Diligentia), Practice (Usus), Labor (Labor), Diligence (Industria), Experience (Experientia), Praise (Lauda) and Architecture (Architectura). Above the doorway of the house a relief depicted the sciences (the seven liberal arts together with painting and architectures) as the principal components of human society. The unknown monogrammist TG portrayed the façade in 1576 in a print. Jozef Linnig made a drawing of the palace in the 19th century but by that time most of the decoration of the façade had disappeared. Floris expressed similar ideas in his composition &quot;The awakening of the Arts&quot; (Museo de Arte de Ponce).

In 1547 Floris married Clara Boudewijns and the couple had one daughter and two sons. The sons Frans and Baptist were later trained as artists by their father. Baptist died young while Frans moved to Italy where he had a successful career.
Frans Floris was known to be hardworking as is testified by his motto: &quot;Als ick werck, dan leef ick: als ick spelen gae, dan sterf ick.&quot; This means &quot;When I work, I live: when I play, I die.&quot; Van Mander recounts that Floris nearly always had a large commission in his workshop on which he would work late at night, and that when he dozed off his pupils would take off his shoes and stockings and put him to bed before they left. Van Mander cites Frans Menton who asserted Floris was loved by his pupils for allowing them more freedom than other Antwerp masters. When a small group of his pupils met up for a reunion after his death they were able to compile a list of 120 of his pupils.

Van Mander recounts that at the end of his life Floris became heavily indebted and started drinking. The debts were likely related to his high costs of living as well as the impact of the &quot;Beeldenstorm&quot; or Iconoclastic Fury that commenced from the 1560s and reached its peak in 1566. During the period of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. It is said Floris never recovered from the shock of seeing his artworks destroyed. Instead, he found himself in a downward spiral in both his personal and professional affairs. His disaffection was so great that he even refused to restore his own works damaged during the Beeldenstorm. He virtually stopped painting after 1566 and his place as the leading history painter in the Habsburg Netherlands was taken by a younger generation of artists among whom Marten de Vos became the most prominent.

Van Mander recounts that while working on a large commission for the grand prior of Spain, Floris became ill and died on 1 October 1570 in Antwerp. His paintings for the grand prior were finished by his studio assistants Frans Pourbus the Elder and Chrispijn van den Broeck. Poems were written about him by Dominicus Lampsonius and the poet-painter Lucas de Heere, who according to van Mander, was his pupil.

==Pupils==
The Netherlands Institute for Art History identifies the following pupils of Frans Floris: Joos de Beer (later the teacher of Abraham Bloemaert), George Boba, Hendrick van den Broeck, Marten van Cleve, Ambrosius Francken, Frans Francken I, Frans Menton (known for schutterstukken in Alkmaar), and Isaac Claesz van Swanenburg. Van Mander lists 26 pupils of Floris, but he may have had as many as 120 assistants. Van Mander&#x27;s list includes Chrispijn van den Broeck, Joris van Ghent (who served Philip II of Spain), Marten (and his brother Hendrick) van Cleve, Lucas de Heere, Anthonie Blocklandt van Montfoort, Thomas van Zirickzee, Simon van Amsterdam, Isaac Claesz van Swanenburg (spelled Isaack Claessen Cloeck), Frans Menton, George Boba, the three Francken brothers Jeroen, Frans and Ambrosius, Joos de Beer, Hans de Maier van Herentals, Apert Francen van Delft, Lois van Brussel, Thomas van Coelen, Hans Daelmans van Antwerpen, Evert van Amersfoort, Herman van der Mast, Damiaen van der Goude, Jeroen van Vissenaken, Steven Croonenborgh uyt den Hage, and Dirck Verlaen van Haerlem.

The long list of pupils and assistants shows that Frans Floris had upon his return to Antwerp adopted the studio practices that he had witnessed in Italy. He relied on a large number of assistants who came from all over the southern and northern Netherlands and even Germany. Floris invented and developed the use of study heads, which were life-size representations of people&#x27;s heads, which he painted in oil on panel. These were then given to his assistants, either for literal transcription or for freer adaptations. His assistants&#x27; role is not always clear and may have ranged from painting after his study heads to adding landscape backgrounds. They also copied his compositions, either in paint or on paper, for reproduction by engravers.

==Work==
===General===

Comparatively few of his works have survived, possibly because many were destroyed during the iconoclastic destructions in Antwerp in the second half of the sixteenth century. The earliest extant canvas by Floris is the &quot;Mars and Venus ensnared by Vulcan&quot; in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin (1547).

Frans Floris is mainly known for his altarpieces, compositions with mythological and allegorical themes and to a lesser extent, for his portraits. He played an important role in introducing the genre of mythological and allegorical subject-matter into Flanders. He was one of the first Netherlandish artists to travel to Italy and study the latest developments in art as well as the Classical relics of Rome. The principal contemporary influences were Michelangelo from whom he borrowed the heroic treatment of the nude and Raphael whom he emulated by developing a ‘relief-like’ idiom. Floris did, however, not abandon the traditional Netherlandish technique of oil paint, which allowed him to fuse its detailed, descriptive properties with his radically new visual language, in which embellishments were reduced to a minimum and the nude played a prominent role.

Floris’ early work of around 1545 shows most clearly the influence of his Italian sojourn. It shows similarities with the work of other Romanists such as Lambert Lombard and Pieter Coecke van Aelst. Later his style became increasingly monumental. His compositional skills improved in that he showed more skill in the arrangement of the figures. After 1560 his work became more Mannerist and the sculptural handling of the figures gave way to a more painterly approach. His palette evolved towards the monochrome. Later he may have been influenced by the school of Fontainebleau as his figures became more elegant and the works more refined.

Just like his brother Cornelis was able to exert influence on contemporary architecture across the borders of Flanders through the medium of the Antwerp publishers, Floris’ work found wide circulation through engravings made by the leading Antwerp engravers. Hieronymus Cock, Philip Galle and Cornelis Cort were the principal engravers involved in this effort but others such as Johannes Wierix, Balthazar van den Bos, Pieter van der Heyden, Frans Huys, Dirck Volckertsz. Coornhert and Jan Sadeler I also made engravings after the works of Frans Floris. Floris also made original designs for series of prints engraved in Antwerp.

===Portraits===

He was a very skilled portraitist but, possibly because of the lower ranking of portraiture in the hierarchy of pictorial genres, he painted only a few (possibly about 12) portraits. He is still regarded as an innovator of the genre as he introduced a new level of expressiveness and accentuated psychological presence. Floris pioneered two types of images in the late 1540s: expressive portraits of individual sitters and head studies on panels. By 1562, Floris’ distinctive head studies had become a form of authorial performance, which bore witness to his creative genius and the workshop practices that he had imported from Italy. While the head studies were made for his own use as well as for the pupils and assistants in his workshop, some were clearly also produced as artworks in their own right. The rapid, expressive brushwork of these panels suggests that he painted some heads as creative studies and thus anticipate in a certain way the tronies of 17th-century artists. These studies became collector&#x27;s items for local art lovers. The head studies testify to the self-conscious artistic culture of Antwerp, where they were valued for their authorship rather than their preparatory value.

Frans Floris made a self-portrait, the original of which has been lost and which is known through a copy in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. He included self-portraits in some of his religious works such as the composition &quot;Rijckart Aertsz as Saint Luke&quot; in which he included himself as the pigment grinder and in the composition &quot;Allegory of the Trinity&quot; (Louvre) where beneath Christ&#x27;s outstretched right arm he painted his self-portrait, which appears out of scale with the other heads around him. The inclusion of his portrait in the latter composition suggests that the painting held a highly personal meaning for the artist. It has been observed that after the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm Flemish artists started including their portraits in religious compositions in order to show their personal commitment to the particular message that the compositions were trying to convey.
Floris painted some family portraits. An example is the &quot;Family portrait&quot; in the Museum Wuyts-Van Campen en Baron Caroly, Lier, which is dated 1561. It was traditionally believed to depict the Berchem family, a prominent family. However, this is no longer accepted unanimously. The painting has two inscriptions, one in the painting itself, the other on its original frame. The first inscription appears on a portrait hanging on the wall behind the figures. It states that the man depicted in the portrait died on 10 January 1559, aged 58 years. The second is the Latin text written at the top and bottom of the frame of the painting. It translates as follows: &quot;As in life there can be nothing happier than a marriage in unison and a bed without discord, there is nothing more pleasant than to see one&#x27;s offspring in unison enjoy peace with an immaculate mind, 1561&quot;. The painting thus simultaneously served as a memento of the deceased father and an expression of the feelings of togetherness of his descendants. Floris depicts all the members of the family performing and attending a concert of music, which emphasized this notion of &#x27;concordia&#x27;, i.e. the harmony within the family.

<text>Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse, FBA (8 September 1864 – 21 June 1929) was an English liberal political theorist and sociologist, who has been considered one of the leading and earliest proponents of social liberalism. His works, culminating in his famous book &quot;Liberalism&quot; (1911), occupy a seminal position within the canon of New Liberalism. 

He worked both as an academic and a journalist, and played a key role in the establishment of sociology as an academic discipline; in 1907 he shared, with Edward Westermarck, the distinction of being the first professor of sociology to be appointed in the United Kingdom, at the University of London. He was also the founder and first editor of &quot;The Sociological Review&quot;. His sister was Emily Hobhouse, the British welfare activist.

== Life ==
Hobhouse was born in St Ive, near Liskeard in Cornwall, the son of Reginald Hobhouse, an Anglican clergyman, and Caroline Trelawny. He attended Marlborough College before reading Greats at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class degree in 1887. Upon his graduation, Hobhouse remained at Oxford as a prize fellow at Merton College before becoming a full fellow at Corpus Christi. Taking a break from academia between 1897 and 1907, Hobhouse worked as a journalist (including a stint with the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;) and as the secretary of a trade union. In 1907, Hobhouse returned to academia, accepting the newly created chair of sociology at the University of London, titled the Martin White Professor of Sociology, where he remained until his death in 1929.

Hobhouse was also an atheist from an early age, despite his father being an archdeacon. He believed that rational tests could be applied to values and that they could be self-consistent and objective.

Hobhouse was never religious. He wrote in 1883 that he was &quot;in politics... a firm radical. In religion... an (if possible yet firmer) agnostic&quot;. In terms of his political and philosophical views, Hobhouse was Gladstonian; a devoted follower of the philosopher John Stuart Mill; and an admirer of John Morley, Bradlaugh; and Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet. These influences led him to various feminist, democratic and secularist political stances. He often proposed republican and democratic motions at debating societies while he was at school.

== Economic policy ==
Hobhouse was important in underpinning the turn-of-the-century &#x27;New Liberal&#x27; movement of the Liberal Party under leaders like H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd George. He distinguished between property held &#x27;for use&#x27; and property held &#x27;for power&#x27;. Governmental co-operation with trade unions could therefore be justified as helping to counter the structural disadvantage of employees in terms of power. He also theorised that property was acquired not only by individual effort but by societal organisation. Essentially, wealth had a social dimension and was a collective product. That means that those who had property owed some of their success to society and thus had some obligation to others. He believed that to provide theoretical justification for a level of redistribution provided by the new state pensions.

Hobhouse disliked Marxist socialism and described his own position as liberal socialism and later as social liberalism. Hobhouse thus occupied a particularly-important place in the intellectual history of the Liberal Democrats.

== Civil liberty ==

His work also presents a positive vision of liberalism in which the purpose of liberty is to enable individuals to develop, not solely that freedom is good in itself. Hobhouse said that coercion should be avoided not for lack of regard for other people&#x27;s well-being but because coercion is ineffective at improving their lot.

While rejecting the practical doctrines of classical liberalism like laissez-faire, Hobhouse praised the work of earlier classical liberals like Richard Cobden in dismantling an archaic order of society and older forms of coercion. Hobhouse believed that one of the defining characteristics of liberalism was its emancipatory character, something that he believed ran constant from classical liberalism to the social liberalism he advocated. He nevertheless emphasised the various forms of coercion already existing in society apart from government. Therefore, he proposed that to promote liberty, the state must ameliorate other forms of social coercion.

Hobhouse held out hope that Liberals and what would now be called the social democrat tendency in the nascent Labour Party could form a grand progressive coalition.

== Foreign policy ==
Hobhouse was often disappointed that fellow collectivists in Britain at the time also tended to be imperialists. Hobhouse opposed the Boer War, and his sister, Emily Hobhouse, did much to draw attention to the abject conditions in the concentration camps established by the British Army in South Africa. Initially opposing the First World War, he later came to support the war effort. He was an internationalist and disliked the pursuit of British national interests as practised by the governments of the day. During the war, Hobhouse criticised the British Idealists such as Bernard Bosanquet in his book &quot;The Metaphysical Theory of the State&quot; (1918) for being Hegelians and therefore Germanizers.

<doc id="854435" wikidata="Q1967252" url="?curid=854435" title="U.S. National Geodetic Survey">
<text>The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is a United States federal agency based in Washington, D.C. that defines and manages a national coordinate system, providing the foundation for transportation and communication, mapping and charting, and a large number of science and engineering applications. Since its founding in 1970, it has been part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a division within the Department of Commerce.

==History==
The National Geodetic Survey&#x27;s history and heritage are intertwined with those of other NOAA offices. It traces its history to the Survey of the Coast, which was formed in 1807 as the first scientific agency of the U.S. federal government. It became the United States Coast Survey in 1836 and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1878, the latter name change reflecting the increasing role of geodesy in its work. Upon the creation of NOAA in 1970, the Coast and Geodetic Survey was abolished and its responsibilities were split among various agencies and offices of NOAA. The Coast and Geodetic Survey′s former geodetic responsibilities were placed under the new National Geodetic Survey in NOAA&#x27;s National Ocean Survey (later renamed the National Ocean Service).

In 2009, former NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps officer Juliana P. Blackwell was named NGS Director, becoming the first woman to head either NGS or any of its ancestor organizations.

==Purpose and function==
The National Geodetic Survey is an office of NOAA&#x27;s National Ocean Service. Its core function is to maintain the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), &quot;a consistent coordinate system that defines latitude, longitude, height, scale, gravity, and orientation throughout the United States&quot;. NGS is responsible for defining the NSRS and its relationship with the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The NSRS enables precise and accessible knowledge of where things are in the United States and its territories.

The NSRS may be divided into its geometric and physical components. The official geodetic datum of the United States, NAD83 defines the geometric relationship between points within the United States in three-dimensional space. The datum may be accessed via NGS&#x27;s network of survey marks or through the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) network of GPS reference antennas. NGS is responsible for computing the relationship between NAD83 and the ITRF. The physical components of the NSRS are reflected in its height system, defined by the vertical datum NAVD88. This datum is a network of orthometric heights obtained through spirit leveling. Because of the close relationship between height and Earth&#x27;s gravity field, NGS also collects and curates terrestrial gravity measurements and develops regional models of the geoid (the level surface that best approximates sea level) and its slope, the deflection of the vertical. NGS is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the NSRS over time, even as the North American plate rotates and deforms over time due to crustal strain, post-glacial rebound, subsidence, elastic deformation of the crust, and other geophysical phenomena.

NGS will release new datums in 2022. The North American Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2022 (NATRF2022) will supersede NAD83 in defining the geometric relationship between the North American plate and the ITRF. United States territories on the Pacific, Caribbean, and Mariana plates will have their own respective geodetic datums. The North American-Pacific Geopotential Datum of 2022 (NAPGD2022) will separately define the height system of the United States and its territories, replacing NAVD88. It will use a geoid model accurate to 1 centimeter (0.4&quot;) to relate orthometric height to ellipsoidal height measured by GPS, eliminating the need for future leveling projects. This geoid model will be based on airborne and terrestrial gravity measurements collected by NGS&#x27;s GRAV-D program as well as satellite-based gravity models derived from observations collected by GRACE, GOCE, and satellite altimetry missions.

NGS provides a number of other public services. It maps changing shorelines in the United States and provides aerial imagery of regions affected by natural disasters, enabling rapid damage assessment by emergency managers and members of the public. The Online Positioning and User Service (OPUS) processes user-input GPS data and outputs position solutions within the NSRS. The agency offers other tools for conversion between datums.

<text>Polidoro Caldara, usually known as Polidoro da Caravaggio ( – 1543), was an Italian painter of the Mannerist period, &quot;arguably the most gifted and certainly the least conventional of Raphael&#x27;s pupils&quot;, who was best known for his now-vanished paintings on the facades of Roman houses. He was unrelated to the later painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, usually known just as Caravaggio, but both came from the town of Caravaggio.

==Life and work==


Polidoro Caldara was born in Caravaggio, in what is now Lombardy. According to Vasari, whilst working as a labourer carrying the materials for the builders of the Vatican logge he ingratiated himself with the artists, and attracted the admiration of Maturino da Firenze, one of Raphael&#x27;s main assistants in the ongoing decoration of the Vatican. He then joined Raphael&#x27;s large workshop, in about 1517, and worked on the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican. He and Maturino then set up as painters of palace facades, usually in sgraffito, with considerable success until the sack of Rome by the army of Charles V under the command of Constable de Bourbon in 1527, in which Maturino was killed. Polidoro fled to Naples, and from there to Messina, where he was very successful. According to tradition, he was about to return from there to the mainland of Italy when he was robbed and murdered by an assistant, Tonno Calabrese, in 1543.

In the second half of the sixteenth century his tomb in Messina (inside Carmine Maggiore, with the tomb of Constantine Lascaris) was totally destroyed during the repression of the Counter-Reformation.

Polidoro&#x27;s main paintings include a &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, painted in Messina, and a &quot;Deposition of Christ&quot; (1527) and a &quot;Christ Carrying the Cross&quot; (1530–34) both in the Museo di Capodimonte of Naples, who have the best collection of his work (an oil sketch for the latter is in the National Gallery, London). They are very individual in style, extremely free in technique, and powerful in expression. The &quot;Christ bearing the Cross&quot; shows considerable Northern influence, probably reflecting the traditionally strong links between Sicily and the Netherlands.

His other works, as well as those of his partner, Maturino da Firenze, have mostly perished from exposure, as most were external decorations on the facades of palaces, but are known from many etchings by Pietro Santi Bartoli, Cherubino Alberti and others. One of his pupils is Deodato Guinaccia. They were authors of the facade decoration in classicising &quot;Graffito&quot;, usually in grisaille, of several Roman houses, like those ones in Borgo and in Parione (near Santa Maria della Pace and in &quot;Via del Pellegrino&quot;). A series of nine small internal wood panels from an unknown palace, perhaps in Naples, of which eight are now in the English Royal Collection, and one in the Louvre, give an idea of the liveliness and quality of these lost works: &quot;Polidoro learned from Raphael the idea of re-creating the decoration of classical antiquity; but he did so with a wit, freedom and spirit of his own&quot;. Being always visible to the public, whilst they lasted the palace facades were very well known and influential, and used by &quot;generations of young artists ... as a visual textbook&quot;. There are also many surviving drawings of high quality.

==Assassination==
According to Vasari, Polidoro was firmly resolved to return to Rome after completing significant projects in Messina. In order to make preparations for this trip, he withdrew all of his savings from the bank for the trip to Rome. Upon discovering this, one of Polidoro&#x27;s workmen, along with several accomplices, resolved to put the master to death on the following night, and then to divide the money among themselves. On the night following, they set upon Polidoro while he was slumbering deeply, and strangled him with a cloth. Then, giving him several wounds, they made sure of his death; After a period of many days when no perpetrator was discovered, it was thought that no one except the workman could have committed the act. Upon receiving intelligence of the assistant&#x27;s alleged involvement, he was captured on the authority of the Count of Messina, and tortured until he confessed to the crime. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced to the gallows, torn with red-hot pincers, and quartered.

==Legacy==
Among Polidoro&#x27;s pupils in Messina was Deodato Guinaccia, Stefano Giordano, Mariano Riccio, Antonello Riccio, Jacopo Vignerio, and Alfonso Lazzaro.

<text>A Personal Record is an autobiographical work (or &quot;fragment of biography&quot;) by Joseph Conrad, published in 1912.

It has also been published under the titles &quot;A Personal Record: Some Reminiscences&quot; and &quot;Some Reminiscences&quot;.

Notoriously unreliable and digressive in structure, it is nonetheless the principal contemporary source for information about the author&#x27;s life. It tells about his schooling in Russian Poland, his sailing in Marseille, the influence of his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, and the writing of &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

It provides a glimpse of how Conrad wished to be seen by his British public, as well as being an atmospheric work of art.

The &quot;Familiar Preface&quot; Conrad wrote for it includes the often quoted lines:

&quot;Those who read me know my conviction that the world, the temporal world, rests on a few very simple ideas; so simple that they must be as old as the hills. It rests notably, among others, on the idea of Fidelity.&quot;

Conrad wrote a new &#x27;Author&#x27;s Note&#x27; to A Personal Record for the Doubleday collected edition of his works (published in 1920) in which he discussed his friendship with the British colonial official and writer Hugh Clifford.

<text>Yevhen Oleksandrovych Hapon (born 30 July 1974, known by his stage name Knjaz Varggoth) is a Ukrainian guitarist, who performs in the black metal act Nokturnal Mortum.

== Biography ==
Yevhen Hapon was born 30 July 1974 in Kharkiv. He is one of the foremost figures in Eastern Europe black metal and far-right musicians. Though he has been involved with numerous music projects and bands (Aryan Terrorism, Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, Lucifugum as a guest musician in 1997, Вече, and more), he is most well known for being the lead vocalist and guitarist for the controversial Ukrainian black metal band Nokturnal Mortum. Nokturnal Mortum gained their reputation performing symphonic black metal with elements of Ukrainian and Slavic folk music and for being a part of the eastern European NSBM scene.

A side project done by Varggoth is the ambient/black metal project Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra, formed in 1994. The most famous album of this project, &quot;The Key to the Gates of the Apocalypse&quot;, is most likely known particularly due to its long runtime (one 72-minute track) and combination of dark ambient and fast black metal.

Knjaz Varggoth also formed the Neo-Nazi hatecore group Aryan Terrorism.

<doc id="854448" wikidata="Q316731" url="?curid=854448" title="Federico Barocci">
<text>Federico Barocci (also written Barozzi) ( – 30 September 1612) was an Italian Renaissance painter and printmaker. His original name was Federico Fiori, and he was nicknamed Il Baroccio. His work was highly esteemed and influential, and foreshadows the Baroque of Rubens. He is generally considered the greatest and the most individual painter of his time in central Italy.

==Early life and training==
He was born at Urbino, Duchy of Urbino, and received his earliest apprenticeship with his father, Ambrogio Barocci, a sculptor of some local eminence. He was then apprenticed with the painter Battista Franco Veneziano in Urbino. He accompanied his uncle, Bartolommeo Genga to Pesaro, then in 1548 to Rome, where he was worked in the pre-eminent studio of the day, that of the Mannerist painters, Taddeo and Federico Zuccari.

==Mature work in Rome and Urbino==
After passing four years at Rome, he returned to his native city, where his first work of art was a &quot;St. Margaret&quot; executed for the Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament. He was invited back to Rome by Pope Pius IV to assist in the decoration of the Vatican Belvedere Palace at Rome, where he painted the &quot;Virgin Mary and infant, with several Saints&quot; and a ceiling in fresco, representing the &quot;Annunciation&quot;.

During this second sojourn, while completing the decorations for the Vatican, Barocci fell ill with intestinal complaints. He suspected that a salad which he had eaten had been poisoned by jealous rivals. Fearing his illness was terminal, he left Rome in 1563; four years later he was said to experience a partial remission after prayers to the Virgin. Barocci henceforth often complained of frail health, though he remained productive for nearly four decades more. While he is described by contemporaries as personally somewhat morose and hypochondriacal, his paintings are lively and brilliant. Although he continued to have major altarpiece commissions from afar, he never returned to Rome, and was mainly patronized in his native city by Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino. The Ducal Palace can be seen in the background of his paintings, rendered in a forced perspective that seems a holdover from Mannerism. 
While Barocci was removed from Rome, the fulcrum of artistic fame and influence, he continued to innovate in his style. At some point he may have seen colored chalk/pastel drawings by Correggio, but Barocci&#x27;s remarkable pastel studies are the earliest examples of the technique to survive. In pastels and in oil sketches (another technique he pioneered) Barocci&#x27;s soft, opalescent renderings evoke the ethereal. Such studies were part of a complex process Barocci used to complete his altarpieces. An organized series of steps leading up to the final product ensured its speed and success in execution. Barocci did innumerable sketches: gestural, compositional, figural studies (using models), lighting studies (using clay models), perspective studies, color studies, nature studies, etc. Today, over 2,000 drawings by him are extant. Every detail of his subsequent cartoons for canvases was worked out in this way. A good example is his famed &quot;Madonna del Popolo&quot; (Uffizi). It is a vortex of color and vitality, made possible by the great variety of people, poses, perspectives, natural details, colors, lighting and atmospheric effects. There are many surviving drawings for the &quot;Madonna del Popolo&quot;, from initial sketches to color studies of heads, to the final full size cartoon. Despite this painstaking process, Barocci&#x27;s genius kept the brushstrokes passionate and liberated, and a spiritual light seems to flicker as a jewel across faces, hands, drapery, and sky.
Barocci&#x27;s embrace of the Counter Reformation would shape his long and fruitful career. By 1566, he joined a lay order of Capuchins, an offshoot of Franciscans. He may have been influenced by Saint Philip Neri, whose Oratorians sought to reconnect the spiritual realm with the lives of everyday people. Neri, who was somewhat ambivalent about the accumulating richness of his Santa Maria in Vallicella, commissioned two completed works from Barocci, the pre-eminent artist of these large pious altarpieces: &quot;The Visitation&quot; (1583–6) and &quot;Presentation of the Virgin&quot; (1593–94). Neri is said to have been moved to ecstasy by Barocci&#x27;s accomplishment in the former painting, which shows the Virgin and Elizabeth greeting each other.

In Urbino, where he painted a &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; for the cathedral of San Lorenzo at Perugia. He again visited Rome during the papacy of Gregory XIII when he painted two admirable pictures for the Chiesa Nuova, representing the &quot;Visitation of the Virgin Mary to Elisabeth&quot; and the &quot; Presentation in the Temple&quot;, and for the Chiesa della Minerva, a &quot;Last Supper&quot;.

==Critical assessment and legacy==

The artist biographer Giovanni Bellori, the Baroque equivalent of Giorgio Vasari, considered Barocci to be among the finest painters of his time. Barocci&#x27;s emotive brushwork was not lost on Peter Paul Rubens when he was in Italy. Rubens is known to have made a sketch of his dramatic &quot;Martyrdom of St Vitale&quot;, in which the martyr&#x27;s undulating flesh is the eye of another whirlwind of figures, gestures, and drama. Also, Rubens&#x27; &quot;The Martyrdom of St Livinus&quot; seems to owe much to Barocci, from the putto with the pointing palm frond to the presence of dogs in the lower right corner. Among the painters and artists who worked under Barocci are Antonio Cimatori (Visacci), Ventura Mazza, Antonio Viviani (il Sordo di Urbino), Giovanni Andrea Urbani, Alessandro Vitali, and finally Felice and Vincenzo Pellegrini. Barocci also had many who followed or were strongly influenced by his style, including Nicolo Martinelli (il Trometta), Giovanni Battista Lombardelli, Domenico Malpiedi, Cesare &amp; Basilio Maggeri, Filippo Bellini, Giovanni Laurentini (Arrigoni), Giorgio Picchi, Giovanni Giacomo Pandolfi, Pietro Paolo Tamburini, Terenzio d’Urbino (&quot;il Rondolino&quot;), Giulio Cesare Begni, Benedetto Marini, Girolamo Cialdieri, Giovanni Battista Urbinelli, Alfonso Patanazzi, Gian Ortensio Bertuzzi, Cesare Franchi (il Pollino), Silla Piccinini, Benedetto Bandiera, Matteuccio Salvucci, Simeone Ciburri, Pietro Rancanelli, Onofrio Marini, Alessandro Brunelli, and Francesco Baldelli.

Barocci&#x27;s swirling composition and the focus on the emotional and spiritual are elements that foreshadow the Baroque of Rubens. But even in Federico&#x27;s Proto-Baroque &quot;Beata Michelina&quot; can see the makings of Bernini&#x27;s High Baroque masterpiece &quot;Ecstasy of St Theresa&quot;.

<text>In agriculture, grazing is a method of animal husbandry whereby domestic livestock are allowed outdoors to free range (roam around) and consume wild vegetations in order to convert the otherwise indigestible (by human gut) cellulose within grass and other forages into meat, milk, wool and other animal products, often on land that is unsuitable for arable farming.

Farmers may employ many different strategies of grazing for optimum production: grazing may be continuous, seasonal, or rotational within a grazing period. Longer rotations are found in ley farming, alternating arable and fodder crops; in rest rotation, deferred rotation, and mob grazing, giving grasses a longer time to recover or leaving land fallow. Patch-burn sets up a rotation of fresh grass after burning with two years of rest. Conservation grazing proposes to use grazing animals to improve the biodiversity of a site. 

Grazing has existed since the beginning of agriculture; sheep and goats were domesticated by nomads before the first permanent settlements were constructed around 7000 BC, enabling cattle and pigs to be kept.

Livestock grazing contributes to many negative effects on the environment, including deforestation, extinction of native wildlife, pollution of streams and rivers, overgrazing, soil degradation, ecological disturbance, desertification, and ecosystem stability.

==History==
Sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs were domesticated early in the history of agriculture. Sheep were domesticated first, soon followed by goats; both species were suitable for nomadic peoples. Cattle and pigs were domesticated somewhat later, around 7000 BC, once people started to live in fixed settlements.

In America, livestock were grazed on public land from the Civil War. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 was enacted after the Great Depression to regulate the use of public land for grazing purposes.

==Production==

According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, about 60% of the world&#x27;s grassland (just less than half of the world&#x27;s usable surface) is covered by grazing systems. It states that &quot;Grazing systems supply about 9 percent of the world&#x27;s production of beef and about 30 percent of the world&#x27;s production of sheep and goat meat. For an estimated 100 million people in arid areas, and probably a similar number in other zones, grazing livestock is the only possible source of livelihood.&quot;

===Management===
Grazing management has two overall goals:

# Protecting the quality of the pasturage against deterioration by overgrazing: in other words, maintain the sustainability of the pasturage
# Protecting the health of the animals against acute threats, such as:
#* Grass tetany and nitrate poisoning
#* Trace element overdose, such as molybdenum and selenium poisoning
#* Grass sickness and laminitis in horses
#* Milk sickness in calves

A proper land use and grazing management technique balances
* maintenance of forage and livestock production, with
* maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

It does this by allowing sufficient recovery periods for regrowth. Producers can keep a low density on a pasture, so as not to overgraze. Controlled burning of the land can help in the regrowth of plants. Although grazing can be problematic for the ecosystem, well-managed grazing techniques can reverse damage and improve the land.

On commons in England and Wales, rights of pasture (grassland grazing) and pannage (forest grazing) for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights can be exercised. For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen cattle, four horses, ponies or donkeys, and fifty geese, while the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different. On some commons (such as the New Forest and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a &#x27;marking fee&#x27; is paid each year for each animal &#x27;turned out&#x27;. However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be &#x27;stinted&#x27;; that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus, rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further.
==Systems==

Ranchers and range science researchers have developed grazing systems to improve sustainable forage production for livestock. These can be contrasted with intensive animal farming on feedlots.

===Continuous===
With continuous grazing, livestock is allowed access to the same grazing area throughout the year.

===Seasonal===

Seasonal grazing incorporates &quot;grazing animals on a particular area for only part of the year&quot;. This allows the land that is not being grazed to rest and allow for new forage to grow.

===Rotational===

Rotational grazing &quot;involves dividing the range into several pastures and then grazing each in sequence throughout the grazing period&quot;. Utilizing rotational grazing can improve livestock distribution while incorporating rest period for new forage.

===Ley farming===
In ley farming, pastures are not permanently planted, but alternated between fodder crops and arable crops.

===Rest rotation===

Rest rotation grazing &quot;divides the range into at least four pastures. One pasture remains rested throughout the year and grazing is rotated amongst the residual pastures.&quot; This grazing system can be especially beneficial when using sensitive grass that requires time for rest and regrowth.

===Deferred rotation===

Deferred rotation &quot;involves at least two pastures with one not grazed until after seed-set&quot;. By using deferred rotation, grasses can achieve maximum growth during the period when no grazing occurs.

===Patch-burn===

Patch-burn grazing burns a third of a pasture each year, no matter the size of the pasture. This burned patch attracts grazers (cattle or bison) that graze the area heavily because of the fresh grasses that grow as a result. The other patches receive little to no grazing. During the next two years the next two patches are burned consecutively, then the cycle begins anew. In this way, patches receive two years of rest and recovery from the heavy grazing. This technique results in a diversity of habitats that different prairie plants and birds can utilize—mimicking the effects of the pre-historical relationship between bison and fire, whereby bison heavily graze one area and other areas have opportunity to rest, based on the concept of pyric herbivory. The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma has been patch-burn grazed with bison herds for over ten years. These efforts have effectively restored the bison–fire relationship on a large landscape scale of . In the grazed heathland of Devon, the periodic burning is known as swailing.

===Riparian area management===

Riparian area grazing is intended to improve wildlife and their habitats. It uses fencing to keep livestock off ranges near streams or water areas until after wildlife or waterfowl periods, or to limit the amount of grazing to a short period of time.

===Conservation grazing===

Conservation grazing is the use of grazing animals to help improve the biodiversity of a site. Due to their hardy nature, rare and native breeds are often used in conservation grazing. In some cases, to re-establish traditional hay meadows, cattle such as the English Longhorn and Highland are used to provide grazing.

===Cell grazing===

A form of rotational grazing using as many small paddocks as fencing allows, said to be more sustainable.

===Mob grazing===

Mob grazing is a system, said to be more sustainable, invented in 2002; it uses very large herds on land left fallow longer than usual.

==Environmental considerations==

===Ecology===
Many ecological effects, which may be positive or negative, derive from grazing. Negative effects of grazing may include overgrazing, increased soil erosion, compaction and degradation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and adverse water quality impacts from run-off. Sometimes grazers can have beneficial environmental effects such as improving the soil with nutrient redistribution and aerating the soil by trampling, and by controlling fire and increasing biodiversity by removing biomass, controlling shrub growth and dispersing seeds. In some habitats, appropriate levels of grazing may be effective in restoring or maintaining native grass and herb diversity in rangeland that has been disturbed by overgrazing, lack of grazing (such as by the removal of wild grazing animals), or by other human disturbance. Conservation grazing is the use of grazers to manage such habitats, often to replicate the ecological effects of the wild relatives of domestic livestock, or those of other species now absent or extinct.

Grazer urine and faeces &quot;recycle nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other plant nutrients and return them to the soil&quot;. Grazing can reduce the accumulation of litter (organic matter) in some seasons and areas, but can also increase it, which may help to combat soil erosion. This acts as nutrition for insects and organisms found within the soil. These organisms &quot;aid in carbon sequestration and water filtration&quot;.

When grass is grazed, dead grass and litter are reduced, which is advantageous for birds such as waterfowl. Grazing can increase biodiversity. Without grazing, many of the same grasses grow, for example brome and bluegrass, consequently producing a monoculture. The ecosystems of North American tallgrass prairies are controlled to a large extent by nitrogen availability, which is itself controlled by interactions between fires and grazing by large herbivores. Fires in spring enhance the growth of certain grasses. Herbivores preferentially graze these grasses, producing a system of checks and balances, and allowing higher plant biodiversity. In Europe heathland is a cultural landscape which requires grazing by cattle, sheep or other grazers to be maintained.

===Conservation===
An author of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report &quot;Livestock&#x27;s Long Shadow&quot;, stated in an interview:

Much grazing land has resulted from a process of clearance or drainage of other habitats such as woodland or wetland.

According to the opinion of the Center for Biological Diversity, extensive grazing of livestock in the arid lands of the southwestern United States has many negative impacts on the local biodiversity there.
In arid climates such as the southwestern United States, livestock grazing has severely degraded riparian areas, the wetland environment adjacent to rivers or streams. The Environmental Protection Agency states that agriculture has a greater impact on stream and river contamination than any other nonpoint source. Improper grazing of riparian areas can contribute to nonpoint source pollution of riparian areas. Riparian zones in arid and semiarid environments have been called biodiversity hotspots. The water, higher biomass, favorable microclimate and periodic flood events together produce higher biological diversity than in the surrounding uplands. In 1990, &quot;according to the Arizona state park department, over 90% of the original riparian zones of Arizona and New Mexico are gone&quot;. A 1988 report of the Government Accountability Office estimated that 90% of the 5,300 miles of riparian habitat managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Colorado was in an unsatisfactory condition, as was 80% of Idaho&#x27;s riparian zones, concluding that &quot;poorly managed livestock grazing is the major cause of degraded riparian habitat on federal rangelands&quot;.

A 2013 FAO report estimated livestock were responsible for 14.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Grazing is common in New Zealand; in 2004, methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture made up somewhat less than half of New Zealand&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions, of which most is attributable to livestock. A 2008 United States Environmental Protection Agency report on emissions found agriculture was responsible for 6% of total United States greenhouse gas emissions in 2006. This included rice production, enteric fermentation in domestic livestock, livestock manure management, and agricultural soil management, but omitted some things that might be attributable to agriculture. Studies comparing the methane emissions from grazing and feedlot cattle concluded that grass-fed cattle produce much more methane than grain-fed cattle. One study in the &quot;Journal of Animal Science&quot; found four times as much, and stated: &quot;these measurements clearly document higher CH4 production for cattle receiving low-quality, high-fiber diets than for cattle fed high-grain diets&quot;.

===Agrivoltaics===

Agrivoltaics for grazing would allow for shade for the animals as well as the vegitation so the soil retains a higher moisture level.

<text>Wilhelm Paul Corssen (20 January 182018 June 1875) was a German philologist noted for his work on Latin and Etruscan topics.

== Biography ==

Corssen was born in Bremen and, after his merchant father moved to Schwedt in the Kingdom of Prussia, received his school education there. After spending some time at the Joachimsthal-Gymnasium in Berlin, where his interest in philological pursuits was awakened by the rector, Meinike, he proceeded to the university, and there came especially under the influence of Philipp August Böckh and Karl Lachmann.

His first important appearance in literature was as the author of &quot;Origines poesis romanae&quot;, by which he had obtained the prize offered by the philosophical or arts faculty of the university. In 1846 he was called from Stettin, where he had for nearly two years held a post in the gymnasium, to occupy the position of lecturer in the royal academy at Pforta (commonly called Schulpforta), and there he continued to labour for the next twenty years.

In 1854 he won a prize offered by the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences for the best work on the pronunciation and accent of Latin, a treatise which at once took rank, on its publication under the title of &quot;Über Aussprache, Vocalismus, und Betonung der lateinischen Sprache&quot; (1858–1859), as one of the most erudite and masterly works in its department. This was followed in 1863 by his &quot;Kritische Beiträge zur lat. Formenlehre&quot;, which were supplemented in 1866 by &quot;Kritische Nachträge zur lat. Formenlehre&quot;.

In the discussion of the pronunciation of Latin he was naturally led to consider the various old Italian dialects, and the results of his investigations appeared in miscellaneous communications to Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für vergleichende Schriftforschung&quot;. Ill-health obliged him to give up his professorship at Pforta and return to Berlin in 1866, but it produced almost no diminution of his literary activity. In 1867 he published an elaborate archaeological study entitled the &quot;Alterthümer und Kunstdenkmale des Cistercienserklosters St Marien und der Landesschule Pforta&quot;, in which he gathered together all that can be discovered about the history of the Pforta academy, the so-called &quot;German Eton&quot;, and in 1868–1869 he brought out a new edition of his work on Latin pronunciation.

From a very early period he had been attracted to the special study of Etruscan remains, and had at various times given occasional expression to his opinions on individual points; but it was not till 1870 that he had the opportunity of visiting Italy and completing his equipment for a formal treatment of the whole subject by personal inspection of the monuments. In 1874 appeared the first volume of &quot;Über die Sprache der Etrusker&quot;, in which with great ingenuity and erudition he endeavoured to prove that the Etruscan language was cognate with that of the Romans. Before the second volume (published posthumously under the editorship of Ernst Kuhn) had received the last touches of his hand, he was cut off in 1875 by a comparatively early death.

==Influence on Friedrich Nietzsche==
In Twilight of the Idols (&quot;What I Owe to the Ancients&quot;) Friedrich Nietzsche, who was educated at the Schulpforta, pays homage to Corssen in discussion of his education and writing style:

:My sense of style, for the epigram as a style, was awakened almost instantly when I came into contact with Sallust. I have not forgotten the surprise of my honored teacher, Corssen, when he had to give his worst Latin pupil the best grade—I had finished with one stroke.

<doc id="854457" wikidata="Q2581397" url="?curid=854457" title="Question Time (TV programme)">
<text>Question Time is a topical debate programme, typically broadcast on BBC One at 10:45 pm on Thursdays. It is usually repeated on BBC Two (with British Sign Language) and on BBC Parliament later in the week. If there is a Leaders special, it would be broadcast simultaneously on BBC News. &quot;Question Time&quot; is also available on BBC iPlayer. Fiona Bruce currently chairs the show having succeeded David Dimbleby as presenter in January 2019.

Mentorn has produced the programme since 1998.

==Origins==
&quot;Question Time&quot; was first broadcast on Tuesday 25 September 1979, based on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Any Questions?&quot; The first panel consisted of Labour MP Michael Foot, author Edna O&#x27;Brien, Conservative politician Teddy Taylor, and the Archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock.

==Format==
&quot;Question Time&quot; panels are typically composed of five public figures, &quot;nearly always [including] a representative from the UK government and the official opposition.&quot; The panel also features &quot;representatives from other political parties across the series, taking as [its] guide the level of electoral support at national level which each party enjoys.&quot;

High-profile journalists and authors, television and radio broadcasters, and comedians, join the panel, as do business leaders from well-known companies, and leading or expert academics, lawyers, police officers, and clerics.

With the exception of Margaret Thatcher, every British Prime Minister that has held office since the programme began in 1979 has appeared as a regular panelist at some point. Additionally, former Prime Ministers Edward Heath and James Callaghan also participated in panels, with Callaghan&#x27;s single appearance coming in a special edition marking the resignation of Thatcher on 22 November 1990. Additionally, every leader of the Conservative party after Thatcher and prior to Rishi Sunak, Labour after Harold Wilson and the Liberal/Liberal Democrat parties after Clement Davies with the single exception of Jeremy Thorpe, have appeared as panelists.

Audience members are selected by the &#x27;audience producer&#x27; based on age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, disability status, voting intention, voting history, and party membership. The audience members are &quot;requested to come up with two questions, to be considered for the programme.&quot; The panel hears the questions for the first time, when the audience members ask them. Applicants are contacted on the Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday before the programme, although due to a &quot;high volume of requests&quot;, the team are unable to call everyone.

&quot;Question Time&quot; is usually recorded &quot;as-live&quot;, and in a single-take, shortly before transmission. The programme is only edited on &quot;very rare&quot; occasions for legal or taste reasons, or because it over-runs. For example, &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper reported in 1986 that &quot;The BBC&#x27;s lawyers ordered nine seconds of &quot;Question Time&quot; to be deleted by the old-fashioned method of simply cutting off the sound&quot;.

==Presenters==
===Sir Robin Day===
Veteran broadcaster Robin Day was the programme&#x27;s first chair, presenting it for nearly 10 years until June 1989. &quot;Question Time&quot; soon gained popularity under Day&#x27;s lead, with his quick wit and interrogation skills. His famous catchphrase when he had introduced the panel was: &quot;There they are, and here we go.&quot;

The programme was mainly filmed at the Greenwood Theatre in London on the south side of London Bridge. Day&#x27;s last appearance as presenter was broadcast from Paris on 12 July 1989. He was allowed to choose his own guests.

===Peter Sissons===

After Day retired, Peter Sissons took over and continued until 1993. The BBC decided to widen the programme&#x27;s appeal by moving it around the country. The programme also changed its London location from the Greenwood Theatre to the Barbican Centre. Sissons&#x27; tenure as &quot;Question Time&quot; chair included three different editors. There were several problems during filming, including a bomb scare during a live recording, which resulted in the programme being taken off the air, and the death of an audience member who collapsed while recording.

The programme continued to enjoy good ratings during this period, notably on the day of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s resignation on 22 November 1990, which featured two different panels over two editions.

===David Dimbleby===
David Dimbleby succeeded Sissons as &quot;Question Time&quot; presenter in 1994, after the BBC held two pilot show auditions between Dimbleby and Jeremy Paxman, with two different audiences and two different panels. For a brief period under Dimbleby in the mid-1990s, there were a number of variations to the format, including the audience using voting keypads to take a poll of the audience at the end of the programme and Dimbleby getting out of his seat at intervals to question the audience.

Dimbleby presented &quot;Question Time&quot; for 25 years, the programme&#x27;s longest-serving presenter, until his final programme, aged 80, on 13 December 2018.

===Fiona Bruce===
In December 2018, the BBC announced that Fiona Bruce would succeed Dimbleby as moderator. Bruce—along with Samira Ahmed, Victoria Derbyshire, Emily Maitlis, Nick Robinson, and Kirsty Wark—attended October 2018 auditions at London&#x27;s James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. She presented her first &quot;Question Time&quot; in January 2019.

===Guest presenters===
&quot;Question Time&quot; has seen various presenters deputise for the main chair. Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Sue Lawley (the first woman to chair the programme), Bernard Levin (who is the only person to have been both programme chair and a panelist), and Donald MacCormick, all moderated in Day&#x27;s place.

In November 2009, John Humphrys presented in lieu of Dimbleby, who had been &quot;injured by a bullock at his farm&quot; causing him &quot;briefly to be knocked out.&quot; In June 2017, Nick Robinson presented a &quot;Leaders Special&quot; edition of &quot;Question Time&quot;. The programme was moved for news coverage of the London Bridge attack. Dimbleby was preparing for the General Election coverage. Victoria Derbyshire presented the 31 March 2022 edition of Question Time in place of Bruce.

==Editors==
The original &#x27;producer&#x27; of Question Time when it began in 1979 was Barbara Maxwell. In 1983, Maxwell was promoted to &#x27;Executive Producer&#x27; with Liz Elton becoming the show&#x27;s producer/editor. At the same time, Ann Morley became the show&#x27;s regular Director; putting the key production roles entirely in female control. Later in 1983, the role of Executive Producer was renamed &#x27;Editor&#x27;. In 1986, Antonia Charlton and Anne Carragher replace Morley and Elton as the show&#x27;s regular director and producer. After 11 years at the helm, Maxwell stepped down from the show in 1990, with her replacement James Hogan editing his first edition on 20 September 1990 Alexandra Henderson took over as editor on 12 September 1991 Christopher Capron became Series Editor in September 1994 Charlie Courtauld was editor from 1998 to 2000, leaving to join the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; as its comment editor. Nick Pisani was appointed in 2000, resigning abruptly in May 2005 after news was leaked that he had been offered a job as David Cameron&#x27;s head of TV presentation. Ed Havard was made acting editor in May 2005 after Pisani left. During his time in charge the BBC offered a seat on the panel to Nick Griffin in 2009. He left when the programme&#x27;s production base moved to Glasgow.

Gill Penlington, the ITV News political producer, was made interim editor in May 2008, when the BBC gave Ed Havard a year-long sabbatical.

==Interactivity==

===SMS contributions===
Viewers of the show can submit comments to the show via SMS; until October 2012 a selection of those comments was posted on Ceefax. Comments were edited and put to air by a team of four journalists based at Television Centre in London. The system displayed one message at a time, and usually showed several tens of messages throughout each hour-long episode. The system&#x27;s popularity sprang from its mix of serious and light-hearted comments. On average, around 3,500 texts are received during each hour-long programme, although 12,000 texts were once recorded in one frantic programme in 2004. Quantity of texts is generally related to the composition of the panel.

===Twitter===
On 24 September 2009, the show launched its Twitter presence and the show&#x27;s presenter has regularly announced its presence on Twitter since late 2009. Using the Twitter ID &quot;@bbcquestiontime&quot; it tweeted using the #bbcqt hashtag. By early 2010, this had become one of the UK&#x27;s most active &quot;Twitter backchannels&quot; to a TV show. @bbcquestiontime claimed 10,000 tweets had been sent around the show on 7 October 2010. The show had over 40,000 followers on Twitter by October 2010 and this exceeded 50,000 on the evening of 3 February 2011.

On 9 June 2011, &quot;Question Time&quot; became one of the most-tweeted about shows of the week in the UK, with 5,000 tweets during the programme, with tweeting continuing through to the next day. In addition to the more sober analysis of the discussion, &quot;Question Time&quot; also has a parallel Twitter backchannel based on the spoof account Dimblebot - purportedly a robot version of Dimbleby - where the entire premise of the programme is claimed to be a demonstration of Dimbleby&#x27;s ability to defeat the panel. It became clear during the riot special that David Dimbleby knows of the existence of Dimblebot and the associated Dimbledance. The @bbcquestiontime account now has over 500,000 followers.

In March 2020, Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi and MP Debbie Abrahams sent an open letter to the programme&#x27;s runners, after Question Time uploaded anti-immigrants Twitter comments from a far-right supporter who allegedly also ran for the National Front and showed support for the English Defence League. Baroness Warsi and Abrahams wrote in their letter: &quot;We understand the producers of the show seek out ‘controversial members of the audience – including those of far-right campaign groups – in an attempt to curry large ratings... By providing a platform for views that are racist or sexist, the institution is normalising them and contributing to the coarsening of public debate and the growing toxicity of our politics.&quot;

==Locations==
===Venues===
&quot;Question Time&quot; is filmed at a variety of different types of building, these have included: educational buildings, arts venues, and government buildings... airports, religious buildings, and prisons.

The programme has been broadcast from the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament, and Westminster Hall.

Heathrow Airport, Wormwood Scrubs Prison, and the cathedrals of St Paul&#x27;s and Winchester, have all hosted &quot;Question Time&quot;.

LSO St Luke&#x27;s and the Sage are among the arts venues to have held the programme and Queen Mary University of London and the University of Birmingham have also hosted &quot;Question Time&quot;.

However, the itinerant nature of the programme will continue.

==Famous editions==

In early 1981, David Steel declared his support in principle for &quot;a marriage&quot; between the Liberal Party and any party which might be formed by the Gang of Four; David Owen, who was also on the programme, said he could see advantages in an &quot;electoral alliance&quot; between them. This prefigured the period 1983–1987 when Owen and Steel were Leaders of the SDP–Liberal Alliance and tension grew over whether their deal was a prelude to a merger of the parties or merely a temporary electoral pact.

During the 1983 election campaign, Conservative Foreign Secretary Francis Pym was asked by an A-level student named Andy Davis about the implications of the Conservatives winning the election with a landslide victory. He began by casting doubt on the likelihood of this happening and then observed &quot;I think landslides on the whole don&#x27;t produce successful governments&quot;. Margaret Thatcher later wrote that the remark &quot;struck a wrong note&quot;: &quot;people drew the inference that he did not want us to win a large majority&quot;. Following the election (won by the Conservatives on a landslide) she sacked him as Foreign Secretary, partly because of his gaffe.

In a 1984 edition, Alan Clark, a junior government Minister at the time, was openly critical of a government decision to buy a foreign-made missile system, prompting guest host Sue Lawley to ask the audience, &quot;Is there anyone here who wishes to defend the government on this, because its Minister doesn&#x27;t?&quot;

A 1994 edition was notable for a confrontation between Jeffrey Archer and the historian David Starkey over the age of homosexual consent. After arguing that 18 should be the age of consent, Archer was attacked by Starkey who told him: &quot;Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.&quot; Archer replied &quot;I enjoyed the very clever way you got a laugh ... I was not sitting on the fence and I was not compromising ... you don&#x27;t have the right to doubt my beliefs and think just because you are an expert in this subject I don&#x27;t have the right to say what I feel or get a cheap laugh out of it. I stand by 18 and I mean it.&quot;

The programme broadcast on 13 September 2001, which was devoted to the political implications of the September 11 attacks, featured many contributions from members of the audience who were anti-American, expressing the view that &quot;the United States had it coming&quot;. The BBC received more than 2,000 complaints and later apologised to viewers for causing offence, stating that the edition should not have been broadcast live, but rather should have been recorded and edited.

In 2002, the editor of &quot;Private Eye&quot;, Ian Hislop, made an open attack on Jeffrey Archer, who had been imprisoned for perjury, when his wife Mary Archer was a fellow panellist. She was noticeably angry that the issue had been raised and criticised Hislop after the recording had finished.

In March 2007, an Iraq Special was broadcast, featuring Tony Benn, Benazir Bhutto, Des Browne, Liam Fox, Charles Kennedy and, via video link from Washington, D.C., John Bolton. The episode is particularly memorable for the clashes between Benn and Bolton.

On 11 October 2007, former editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper Kelvin MacKenzie appeared on the programme in Cheltenham and launched an attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that &quot;Scotland believes not in entrepreneurialism like London and the south east... Scots enjoy spending it (money) but they don&#x27;t enjoy creating it, which is the opposite to down south.&quot; The comments came as part of an attack on Prime Minister Gordon Brown who MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was &quot;a Scot&quot; and a &quot;socialist&quot;, and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist Chuka Umunna from the think tank Compass called his comments &quot;absolutely disgraceful&quot;, and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received 350 complaints and MacKenzie&#x27;s comments drew widespread criticism in both Scotland and England. On 3 July 2008, it was reported that the BBC Trust&#x27;s editorial complaints unit had cleared the programme of any wrongdoing. &quot;Question Time&quot; then proceeded to broadcast the following question from Nick Hartley as part of the programme on the same evening: &quot;After the media coverage of [Andy] Murray&#x27;s rise and fall, are we now to infer that the English resent the Scots more than the Scots resent the English?&quot; MacKenzie reappeared on the programme in Cardiff on 17 May 2012.

After he was elected to the European Parliament, Nick Griffin the leader of the British National Party was invited onto &quot;Question Time&quot; for the first time, to appear on 22 October 2009. The decision led to controversy and political debate. Hundreds of people protested outside BBC Television Centre as the edition was filmed; six people were arrested after 25 protesters forced their way into the main reception. The edition attracted eight million viewers, and also drew a large number of complaints as a result of its content. Griffin himself said that he would make a formal complaint to the BBC for the way he believed he was treated by the show&#x27;s other guests and the audience, who he described as a &quot;lynch mob.&quot;

An edition aired on 19 May 2011 was recorded at Wormwood Scrubs Prison in London. The episode was the first to feature prisoners as part of the audience, while panellists included Justice Secretary Ken Clarke who attempted to defend controversial remarks he had made earlier in the week about rape sentencing.

A special edition of the programme was aired on 11 August 2011 following the outbreak of rioting which had occurred during the previous weekend and earlier that week. &quot;Question Time&quot; had been off air for its annual summer break at the time and the edition was a scheduled at short notice due to the English riots.

An appearance by George Galloway on the edition of 5 February 2015 recorded in Finchley gained much negative comment before the broadcast. Inviting Galloway, a politician who has been outspoken about Israel, onto the programme was thought to be provocative and insensitive because Finchley has a large Jewish minority. Galloway, who was heckled during a discussion about antisemitism, thought he had been defamed by a question posed to him, which insinuated that he should share some of the blame for a rise in antisemitic incidents during 2014.

On 23 November 2017 the programme was shortened because an audience member became ill and could not be safely moved.

On 19 March 2020 the programme broadcast from Weston-super-Mare was the first without an audience, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 26 March 2020 the programme moved to a semi-permanent home at the IMG Studios at Stockley Park in London as a measure to prevent unnecessary travel during the Coronavirus outbreak, the show followed a different format with no audience, the number of panellists reduced to four and the removal of the desk table, with the panellists and host now sitting on chairs in a semi-circle, 2m apart from one another in order to observe social distancing rules. At the same time, the programme moved to a new, temporary timeslot of 8pm, so that it could be broadcast live and allow viewers to submit their own questions to be answered on the programme.

Four-time Formula One World Champion and Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association, the trade union for F1, director Sebastian Vettel appeared on the 12 May 2022 edition, which was broadcast from Hackney.

==Audience figures==

The highest audience figures to date were recorded when Nick Griffin of the BNP appeared in an episode on 22 October 2009; the audience reaching 8.3 million viewers.

On 14 May 2009, &quot;Question Time&quot; discussed the MPs&#x27; expenses row, with audience members heckling guest panellists Menzies Campbell and Margaret Beckett, the Labour MP, who was booed by the audience for insisting that her expenses were her privilege. The TV audience reached 3.8 million.

3.4 million people watched in 2003 at the start of the war on Iraq.

<text>Veno Pilon (22 September 1896 – 23 September 1970) was a Slovene expressionist painter, graphic artist and photographer. He was born and died in Ajdovščina.

== Biography ==

Pilon was born in Ajdovščina, then part of the Austro-Hungarian province of Gorizia and Gradisca (now in Slovenia). After he had finished the Gorizia Grammar School, he was drafted by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He fought on the Eastern front and was captured by the Russian army. He later described his experience as a prisoner of war in the autobiography &quot;Na robu&quot; (&quot;On the Edge&quot;). He returned to Ajdovščina in 1919, where he took up painting and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague.

In the late 1920s Pilon moved to Paris, where he explored photography and translating Slovene literature into French.

After a donation by his son, Dominique, his work in on permanent display at the Pilon Gallery in Ajdovščina.
