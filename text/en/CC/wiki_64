<text>Cadmium sulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula CdS. Cadmium sulfide is a yellow salt. It occurs in nature with two different crystal structures as the rare minerals greenockite and hawleyite, but is more prevalent as an impurity substituent in the similarly structured zinc ores sphalerite and wurtzite, which are the major economic sources of cadmium. As a compound that is easy to isolate and purify, it is the principal source of cadmium for all commercial applications. Its vivid yellow color led to its adoption as a pigment for the yellow paint &quot;cadmium yellow&quot; in the 1800s.

==Production==
Cadmium sulfide can be prepared by the precipitation from soluble cadmium(II) salts with sulfide ion. This reaction has been used for gravimetric analysis and qualitative inorganic analysis.The preparative route and the subsequent treatment of the product, affects the polymorphic form that is produced (i.e., cubic vs hexagonal). It has been asserted that chemical precipitation methods result in the cubic zincblende form.

Pigment production usually involves the precipitation of CdS, the washing of the solid precipitate to remove soluble cadmium salts followed by calcination (roasting) to convert it to the hexagonal form followed by milling to produce a powder. When cadmium sulfide selenides are required the CdSe is co-precipitated with CdS and the cadmium sulfoselenide is created during the calcination step.

Cadmium sulfide is sometimes associated with sulfate reducing bacteria.

===Routes to thin films of CdS===
Special methods are used to produce films of CdS as components in some photoresistors and solar cells. In the chemical bath deposition method, thin films of CdS have been prepared using thiourea as the source of sulfide anions and an ammonium buffer solution to control pH:
:Cd2+ + H2O + (NH2)2CS + 2 NH3 → CdS + (NH2)2CO + 2 NH4+

Cadmium sulfide can be produced using metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy and MOCVD techniques by the reaction of dimethylcadmium with diethyl sulfide:
:Cd(CH3)2 + Et2S → CdS + CH3CH3 + C4H10
Other methods to produce films of CdS include
* Sol–gel techniques
* Sputtering
* Electrochemical deposition
* Spraying with precursor cadmium salt, sulfur compound and dopant
* Screen printing using a slurry containing dispersed CdS

==Reactions==
Cadmium sulfide can be dissolved in acids.
:CdS + 2 HCl → CdCl2 + H2S

When solutions of sulfide containing dispersed CdS particles are irradiated with light, hydrogen gas is generated:
: H2S → H2 + S Δf&quot;H&quot; = +9.4 kcal/mol
The proposed mechanism involves the electron/hole pairs created when incident light is absorbed by the cadmium sulfide followed by these reacting with water and sulfide:
:Production of an electron–hole pair
::CdS + &quot;hν&quot; → e− + h+
:Reaction of electron
::2e− + 2H2O → H2 + 2OH−
:Reaction of hole
::2h+ + S2− → S

==Structure and physical properties==
Cadmium sulfide has, like zinc sulfide, two crystal forms. The more stable hexagonal wurtzite structure (found in the mineral Greenockite) and the cubic zinc blende structure (found in the mineral Hawleyite). In both of these forms the cadmium and sulfur atoms are four coordinate. There is also a high pressure form with the NaCl rock salt structure.

Cadmium sulfide is a direct band gap semiconductor (gap 2.42 eV). The proximity of its band gap to visible light wavelengths gives it a coloured appearance. As well as this obvious property other properties result:
* the conductivity increases when irradiated, (leading to uses as a photoresistor)
* when combined with a p-type semiconductor it forms the core component of a photovoltaic (solar) cell and a CdS/Cu2S solar cell was one of the first efficient cells to be reported (1954)
* when doped with for example Cu+ (&quot;activator&quot;) and Al3+ (&quot;coactivator&quot;) CdS luminesces under electron beam excitation (cathodoluminescence) and is used as phosphor
* both polymorphs are piezoelectric and the hexagonal is also pyroelectric
* electroluminescence
* CdS crystals can act as a gain medium in solid state laser
* In thin-film form, CdS can be combined with other layers for use in certain types of solar cells. CdS was also one of the first semiconductor materials to be used for thin-film transistors (TFTs). However interest in compound semiconductors for TFTs largely waned after the emergence of amorphous silicon technology in the late 1970s.
* Thin films of CdS can be piezoelectric and have been used as transducers which can operate at frequencies in the GHz region.
* Nanoribbons of CdS show a net cooling due annihilation of phonons, during anti-Stokes luminescence at ~510 nm. As a result, a maximum temperature drop of 40 and 15 K has been demonstrated when the nanoribbons are pumped with a 514 or 532 nm laser.

==Applications==

===Pigment===

CdS is used as pigment in plastics, showing good thermal stability, light and weather fastness, chemical resistance and high opacity. As a pigment, CdS is known as cadmium yellow (CI pigment yellow 37). About 2000 tons are produced annually as of 1982, representing about 25% of the cadmium processed commercially.

===Historical use in art===
The general commercial availability of cadmium sulfide from the 1840s led to its adoption by artists, notably Van Gogh, Monet (in his London series and other works) and Matisse (&quot;Bathers by a River&quot; 1916–1919). The presence of cadmium in paints has been used to detect forgeries in paintings alleged to have been produced prior to the 19th century.

===CdS-CdSe solutions===
CdS and CdSe form solid solutions with each other. Increasing amounts of cadmium selenide, gives pigments verging toward red, for example CI pigment orange 20 and CI pigment red 108.Such solid solutions are components of photoresistors (light dependent resistors) sensitive to visible and near infrared light.

==Safety==
Cadmium sulfide is toxic, especially dangerous when inhaled as dust, and cadmium compounds in general are classified as carcinogenic. Problems of biocompatibility have been reported when CdS is used as colors in tattoos. CdS has an LD50 of approximately 7,080 mg/kg in rats - which is higher than other cadmium compounds due to its low solubility.

<doc id="862628" wikidata="Q1202776" url="?curid=862628" title="Kōza District, Kanagawa">
<text>is a district located in central Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It currently consists of only one town, Samukawa. The entire cities of Chigasaki, Fujisawa, Yamato, Ayase, Ebina, Zama; and parts of the city of Sagamihara, were formerly part of Kōza District.

As of 2009, the district has an estimated population of 47,812 and a density of 3,560 persons per km2. The total area is 13.42 km2.

== Towns and villages ==
*Samukawa

== History ==

Kōza District was one of the ancient subdivisions of Sagami Province, extending from Sagami Bay north to the border of Musashi Province between the Sagami River and the Sakai River. It was mentioned in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; records of 675 AD in the Nara period as . The provincial capital of Sagami Province and its &quot;kokubunji&quot; were located within Kōza District, although its exact location is today unknown.

The area was under the control of various &quot;shōen&quot; from the Heian period through the Sengoku period, and was held as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered by the &quot;shōgun&quot; under the Tokugawa shogunate of the Edo period.

===Timeline===
After the Meiji Restoration, it was established as a district under the cadastral reform of 1878, with a district office built near what is now part of Chigasaki. This was moved to Fujisawa-Ōsaka Town (present-day Fujisawa) in 1906.

* On April 1, 1889, Kōza District was divided into one town (Fujisawa-Ōsaka) and 22 villages. In 1908, Chigasaki Village became a town, as did Kamimizo in 1928, and Zama in 1937. Fujisawa became a city in 1940. Samukawa and Ebina became towns the same year. In 1941, Zama, Kamimizo and six neighboring villages merged to form the town of Sagamihara. Yamato became a town in 1943, Shibuya in 1944 and Ayase in 1945. Chigasaki became a city in 1947.
* In 1948, Zama was separated from Sagamihara, which became a city in 1954.
* The town of Shibuya dissolved in 1955, with the southern portions merging with Fujisawa, and the northern portion reverting to the status of village until absorbed by Yamato town in 1956. Yamato became a city in 1959, and both Ebina and Zama became cities in 1971, and Ayase in 1978, leaving Samukawa as the only remaining component of Kōza District.

*Hiratsuka
*Ninomiya

===Climate===
Ōiso has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Ōiso is 15.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2144 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.2 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōiso has grown steadily over the past century, with a slight drop from 2010 to 2020.

==History==
Ōiso is the ancient centre of Sagami Province. The exact location of the Nara period provincial government of Sagami Province is unknown, but tradition and the place name &quot;Kōzu&quot; place its probable location within the boundaries of present-day Ōiso.

As a minor coastal settlement, Ōiso was under the control of the later Hōjō clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. In the Edo period, it was nominally part of Odawara Domain, and developed as Ōiso-juku, a post town on the Tōkaidō connecting Edo with Kyoto. After the Meiji Restoration and with the establishment of the district system in 1878, it came under the control of . Ōiso became a town on 1 April 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Blessed with a temperate climate, and with convenient access to Tokyo due to the Tōkaidō Main Line railway, it was favoured as a seaside health resort by politicians and literary figures during the Meiji period after a glowing report on its location was written by noted physician Matsumoto Jun. Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo, Saionji Kinmochi and Ōkuma Shigenobu, Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu, writer Shimazaki Toson and &quot;zaibatsu&quot; founder Yasuda Zenjirō had summer residences in Ōiso. This popularity continued into the postwar era, and Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida also had a residence in Ōiso to which he retired after leaving politics. The former Itō, Yoshida and Shimazaki residences have been preserved as memorial museums.

Ōiso merged with neighbouring town Kokufu on 1 December 1954.

==Government==
Ōiso has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 14 members. Ōiso, together with neighboring Ninomiya, contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Kanagawa 15th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy of Ōiso is based primarily on seasonal tourism, agriculture and commercial fishing. The town is also a bedroom community for both Tokyo/Yokohama and Odawara

==Education==
Ōiso has one public elementary schools and one public middle schools operated by the town government. The town has one public high school operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private elementary school, middle school and high school. The private Seisa University has a campus at Ōiso.

<doc id="862635" wikidata="Q7848173" url="?curid=862635" title="Trust metric">
<text>In psychology and sociology, a trust metric is a measurement or metric of the degree to which one social actor (an individual or a group) trusts another social actor. Trust metrics may be abstracted in a manner that can be implemented on computers, making them of interest for the study and engineering of virtual communities, such as Friendster and LiveJournal.

Trust escapes a simple measurement because its meaning is too subjective for universally reliable metrics, and the fact that it is a mental process, unavailable to instruments. There is a strong argument against the use of simplistic metrics to measure trust due to the complexity of the process and the &#x27;embeddedness&#x27; of trust that makes it impossible to isolate trust from related factors.

There is no generally agreed set of properties that make a particular trust metric better than others, as each metric is designed to serve different purposes, e.g. provides certain classification scheme for trust metrics. Two groups of trust metrics can be identified:
* Empirical metrics focusing on supporting the capture of values of trust in a reliable and standardized way;
* Formal metrics that focus on formalization leading to the ease of manipulation, processing and reasoning about trust. Formal metrics can be further classified depending on their properties.

Trust metrics enable trust modelling and reasoning about trust. They are closely related to reputation systems. Simple forms of binary trust metrics can be found e.g. in PGP. The first commercial forms of trust metrics in computer software were in applications like eBay&#x27;s Feedback Rating. Slashdot introduced its notion of &quot;karma&quot;, earned for activities perceived to promote group effectiveness, an approach that has been very influential in later virtual communities.

==Empirical metrics==

Empirical metrics capture the value of trust by exploring the behavior or introspection of people, to determine the perceived or expressed level of trust. Those methods combine theoretical background (determining what it is that they measure) with defined set of questions and statistical processing of results.

The willingness to cooperate, as well as actual cooperation, are commonly used to both demonstrate and measure trust. The actual value (level of trust and/or trustworthiness) is assessed from the difference between observed and hypothetical behaviors i.e. those that would have been anticipated in the absence of cooperation.

===Surveys===

Surveys capture the level of trust by means of both observations or introspection, but without engaging into any experiments. Respondents are usually providing answers to a set of questions or statements and responses are e.g. structured according to a Likert scale. Differentiating factors are the underlying theoretical background and contextual relevance.

One of the earliest surveys are McCroskey&#x27;s scales that have been used to determine authoritativeness (competence) and character (trustworthiness) of speakers. Rempel&#x27;s trust scale and Rotter&#x27;s scale are quite popular in determining the level of interpersonal trust in different settings. The Organizational Trust Inventory (OTI) is an example of an exhaustive, theory-driven survey that can be used to determine the level of trust within the organisation.

For a particular research area a more specific survey can be developed. For example, the interdisciplinary model of trust, has been verified using a survey while uses a survey to establish the relationship between design elements of the web site and perceived trustworthiness of it.

===Games===

Another empirical method to measure trust is to engage participants in experiments, treating the outcome of such experiments as estimates of trust. Several games and game-like scenarios have been tried, some of which estimate trust or confidence in monetary terms (see for an interesting overview).

Games of trust are designed in a way that their Nash equilibrium differ from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximize their own utility by altering his selfish strategy without cooperation, while cooperating partners can benefit. Trust can be therefore estimated on the basis of monetary gain attributable to cooperation.

The original &#x27;game of trust&#x27; has been described in as an abstracted investment game between an investor and his broker. The game can be played once or several times, between randomly chosen players or in pairs that know each other, yielding different results.

Several variants of the game exist, focusing on different aspects of trust as the observable behaviour. For example, rules of the game can be reversed into what can be called a game of distrust, declaratory phase can be introduced or rules can be presented in a variety of ways, altering the perception of participants.

Other interesting games are e.g. binary-choice trust games, the gift-exchange game, cooperative trust games, and various other forms of social games. Specifically the Prisoners Dilemma are popularly used to link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity. For multi-player games, different forms of close market simulations exist.

==Formal metrics==

Formal metrics focus on facilitating trust modelling, specifically for large scale models that represent trust as an abstract system (e.g. social network or web of trust). Consequently, they may provide weaker insight into the psychology of trust, or in particulars of empirical data collection. Formal metrics tend to have a strong foundations in algebra, probability or logic.

===Representation===

There is no widely recognised way to attribute value to the level of trust, with each representation of a &#x27;trust value&#x27; claiming certain advantages and disadvantages. There are systems that assume only binary values, that use fixed scale, where confidence range from −100 to +100 (while excluding zero), from 0 to 1 or from [−1 to +1); where confidence is discrete or continuous, one-dimensional or have many dimensions. Some metrics use ordered set of values without attempting to convert them to any particular numerical range (e.g. See for a detailed overview).

There is also a disagreement about the semantics of some values. The disagreement regarding the attribution of values to levels of trust is specifically visible when it comes to the meaning of zero and to negative values. For example, zero may indicate either the lack of trust (but not distrust), or lack of information, or a deep distrust. Negative values, if allowed, usually indicate distrust, but there is a doubt whether distrust is simply trust with a negative sign, or a phenomenon of its own.

===Subjective probability===

Subjective probability focuses on trustor&#x27;s self-assessment about his trust in the trustee. Such an assessment can be framed as an anticipation regarding future behaviour of the trustee, and expressed in terms of probability. Such a probability is subjective as it is specific to the given trustor, their assessment of the situation, information available to him etc. In the same situation other trustors may have a different level of a subjective probability.

Subjective probability creates a valuable link between formalisation and empirical experimentation. Formally, subjective probability can benefit from available tools of probability and statistics. Empirically, subjective probability can be measured through one-side bets. Assuming that the potential gain is fixed, the amount that a person bets can be used to estimate his subjective probability of a transaction.

===Uncertain probabilities (subjective logic)===

The logic for uncertain probabilities (subjective logic) has been introduced by Josang, where uncertain probabilities are called &quot;subjective opinions&quot;. This concept combines probability distribution with uncertainty, so that each opinion about trust can be viewed as a distribution of probability distributions where each distribution is qualified by associated uncertainty. The foundation of the trust representation is that an opinion (an evidence or a confidence) about trust can be represented as a four-tuple (trust, distrust, uncertainty, base rate), where trust, distrust and uncertainty must add up to one, and hence are dependent through additivity.

Subjective logic is an example of computational trust where uncertainty is inherently embedded in the calculation process and is visible at the output. It is not the only one, it is e.g. possible to use a similar quadruplet (trust, distrust, unknown, ignorance) to express the value of confidence, as long as the appropriate operations are defined. Despite the sophistication of the subjective opinion representation, the particular value of a four-tuple related to trust can be easily derived from a series of binary opinions about a particular actor or event, thus providing a strong link between this formal metric and empirically observable behaviour.

Finally, there are CertainTrust and CertainLogic. Both share a common representation, which is equivalent to subjective opinions, but based on three independent parameters named &#x27;average rating&#x27;, &#x27;certainty&#x27;, and &#x27;initial expectation&#x27;. Hence, there is a bijective mapping between the CertainTrust-triplet and the four-tuple of subjective opinions.

===Fuzzy logic===

Fuzzy systems, as trust metrics can link natural language expressions with a meaningful numerical analysis.

Application of fuzzy logic to trust has been studied in the context of peer-to-peer networks to improve peer rating. Also for grid computing it has been demonstrated that fuzzy logic allows to solve security issues in reliable and efficient manner.

==Properties of trust metrics==

The set of properties that should be satisfied by a trust metric vary, depending on the application area. Following is a list of typical properties.

===Transitivity===

Transitivity is a highly desired property of a trust metric. In situations where A trusts B and B trusts C, transitivity concerns the extent to which A trusts C. Without transitivity, trust metrics are unlikely to be used to reason about trust in more complex relationships.

The intuition behind transitivity follows everyday experience of &#x27;friends of a friend&#x27; (FOAF), the foundation of social networks. However, the attempt to attribute exact formal semantics to transitivity reveals problems, related to the notion of a trust scope or context. For example, defines conditions for the limited transitivity of trust, distinguishing between direct trust and referral trust. Similarly, shows that simple trust transitivity does not always hold, based on information on the Advogato model and, consequently, have proposed new trust metrics.

The simple, holistic approach to transitivity is characteristic to social networks (FOAF, Advogato). It follows everyday intuition and assumes that trust and trustworthiness apply to the whole person, regardless of the particular trust scope or context. If one can be trusted as a friend, one can be also trusted to recommend or endorse another friend. Therefore, transitivity is semantically valid without any constraints, and is a natural consequence of this approach.

The more thorough approach distinguishes between different scopes/contexts of trust, and does not allow for transitivity between contexts that are semantically incompatible or inappropriate. A contextual approach may, for instance, distinguish between trust in a particular competence, trust in honesty, trust in the ability to formulate a valid opinion, or trust in the ability to provide reliable advice about other sources of information. A contextual approach is often used in trust-based service composition. The understanding that trust is contextual (has a scope) is a foundation of a collaborative filtering.

===Operations===

For a formal trust metric to be useful, it should define a set of operations over values of trust in such way that the result of those operations produce values of trust. Usually at least two elementary operators are considered:

* fusion that provides a quasi-additive functionality, allowing to consolidate trust values coming from several sources;
* discounting that provides a quasi-multiplicative functionality, allowing the advice/trust opinion provided by a source to be discounted as a function of the trust in the source, which is the principle for transitive trust computation.

The exact semantics of both operators are specific to the metric. Even within one representation, there is still a possibility for a variety of semantic interpretations. For example, for the representation as the logic for uncertain probabilities, trust fusion operations can be interpreted by applying different rules (Cumulative fusion, averaging fusion, constraint fusion (Dempster&#x27;s rule), Yager&#x27;s modified Dempster&#x27;s rule, Inagaki&#x27;s unified combination rule, Zhang&#x27;s centre combination rule, Dubois and Prade&#x27;s disjunctive consensus rule etc.). Each interpretations leads to different results, depending on the assumptions for trust fusion in the particular situatation to be modelled. See for detailed discussions.

===Scalability===

The growing size of networks of trust make scalability another desired property, meaning that it is computationally feasible to calculate the metric for large networks. Scalability usually puts two requirements of the metric:

* The elementary operation (e.g. fusion or discount) is computationally feasible, e.g. that relationships between context of trust can be quickly established.
* The number of elementary operations scale slowly with the growth of the network.

===Attack resistance===

&quot;Attack resistance&quot; is an important non-functional property of trust metrics which reflects their ability not to be overly influenced by agents who try to manipulate the trust metric and who participate in bad faith (i.e. who aim to abuse the presumption of trust).

The free software developer resource Advogato is based on a novel approach to attack-resistant trust metrics of Raph Levien. Levien observed that Google&#x27;s PageRank algorithm can be understood to be an attack resistant trust metric rather similar to that behind Advogato.

<doc id="862636" wikidata="Q1202849" url="?curid=862636" title="Naka District, Kanagawa">
<text>is a district located in central Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It currently consists of two towns, Ōiso, and Ninomiya. The majority of the area of the city of Hadano and the entire cities of Hiratsuka and Isehara were formerly part of Naka District.

As of 2009, the district had an estimated population of 62,522 and a density of 2,380 persons per km2. The total area was 26.26 km2.

== Towns and villages ==
*Ninomiya
*Ōiso

==History==

Naka District was one of the four subdivisions of Sagami Province established by the later Hōjō clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. In the Edo period, it was nominally part of Odawara Domain, although large portions were &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled by the &quot;shōgun&quot; in Edo through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;.

===Timeline===
After the Meiji Restoration and with the establishment of the district system in 1878, the territory came under the control of and . On March 26, 1896, these two districts were joined to form the modern Naka District, which initially consisted of five towns and 23 villages. Hiratsuka was elevated to city status in 1932, followed by Hadano in 1955 and Isehara in 1971.

==History==
During the Kamakura period, the area around Yugawara was called &quot;Doi County&quot; in Sagami Province.

After the Meiji Restoration, it was divided into six hamlets, and initially formed part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture, before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District of Kanagawa Prefecture. In April 1889, four of the six hamlets merged to form Doi village with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The remaining two hamlets merged to form Yoshihama village. On July 1, 1926, Doi village was elevated to town status, taking the new name of Yugawara. Yoshihama attained town status on April 1, 1940, and merged into Yugawara on April 1, 1955. A planned merger of Yugawara into Odawara in 2005 was rejected by local voters in an August 8, 2004 referendum.

<text>is a district of Japan located in western Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Most sparsely populated mountainous districts are part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The majority area of the city of Odawara was formerly part of Ashigarashimo District.

As of 2009, the district had an estimated population of 48,713 and a density of 346 persons per km2. The total area was 140.73 km2.

== Towns and villages ==
*Hakone
*Manazuru
*Yugawara

==History==

Ashigarashimo District was one of the ancient subdivisions of Sagami Province, per the Nara period Ritsuryō system, under the name . The area was under the control of the later Hōjō clan in the Sengoku period, and part of Odawara Domain during the Edo period. Following disasters caused by eruptions of nearby Mount Fuji, a portion also came to be held as &quot;tenryō&quot; territory administered by the Tokugawa shogunate.

===Timeline===
After the Meiji Restoration, it initially formed part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before it was established as a district of Kanagawa Prefecture under the cadastral reform of 1878. In 1889, it was administratively divided into two towns (Odawara and Hakone) and 30 villages. On December 20, 1940, Odawara was elevated to city status. Local voters rejected a planned merger of Yugawara into Odawara in 2005 in an August 8, 2004 referendum.

A portion of the Tanzawa Mountains can be found in the western part of the town. Miyagase Dam, a major source of hydroelectric power, is situated on the Nakatsu River. The highest mountain in Aikawa is Mount Takatori.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Kanagawa Prefecture
*Atsugi
*Kiyokawa
*Sagamihara

Aikawa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Aikawa is 13.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1906 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.5 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Aikawa grew rapidly during the late 20th century and has plateaued in the 21st.

==History==
During the Sengoku period, the Battle of Mimasetoge between the forces of Takeda Shingen and the later Hōjō clan occurred on what is now Aikawa Town. During the Edo period, the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, Aikawa village was founded on April 4, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to town status on April 1, 1940. The Imperial Japanese Army established the Sagami Airfield in Aikawa, which was also adjacent to military factories in Sagamihara, an officer&#x27;s training school in Zama, and numerous Army and Imperial Japanese Navy facilities in Atsugi and Yokohama. On January 15, 1955, Aikawa merged with neighboring Takamine Village and on September 30, 1956, with neighboring Nakatsu Village. In 1966, an industrial park was built on the site of the former airfield and military facilities.

==Government==
Aikawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Aikawa, together with neighboring Kiyokawa, contributes one member to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Kanagawa 16th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Aikawa has a mixed economy, supported by agriculture and light/precision industries. Makino Milling Machines has a factory in Aikawa, as does Asahi Glass Co., NHK Spring Company, Merck Pharmaceuticals and Mitsubishi Motors. The town also serves as a bedroom community for neighboring Sagamihara and Atsugi.

==Education==
Aikawa has six public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

== Internationalization ==

Aikawa town has a population of just under 40,000, which is relatively small for a municipality in Kanagawa Prefecture, but the percentage of foreign residents is high. The percentage of foreign residents, approximately 7.5% of the total population, is the highest in Kanagawa Prefecture, ahead of other international cities such as Yokohama. In addition to South America and Asia, people from 48 countries and regions, including European and African countries, have settled in Aikawa.

One reason for the large number of foreign residents in Aikawa is thought to be the demand for labor in the Aikawa Inland Industrial Park, one of the largest industrial parks in Kanagawa Prefecture, which was completed in 1966. In addition, the Planning and Policy Division of Aikawa Town cites the 1990 amendment to the Immigration Control Act as a turning point in the increase of foreign residents. Despite the Lehman Shock in 2008, the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, and the spread of the new coronavirus in 2020, the number of foreign residents in Aikawa has continued to increase.

A large Vietnamese Buddhist temple, Chua Vietnam, is located in Aikawa Town. In addition to Chua Vietnam, there is also &quot;the Cambodian Cultural Center in Japan, which was planned as a Theravada Buddhist temple and cultural center for Cambodians living in Japan; &quot;the Lao Cultural Center in Japan&quot;, which is considered the only Lao Buddhist temple in Japan for Laotians living in Japan; and &quot;Wat Rakhang Japan&quot;, a branch temple of Wat Rakhang, known as the Bell Temple in Thailand for Thai residents in Japan.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Aikawa does not have any passenger railway service.

<text>REACT (Radio Emergency Associated Communication Teams) is a CB radio Emergency Channel 9 monitoring organizations across the United States, Canada and worldwide, established in 1962. The primary role of REACT volunteers was to stand and watch on CB Emergency Channel 9 to help motorists. Later, duties grew to include radio communications after disasters (e.g., tornadoes and floods), and before disasters (storm spotting). REACT safety communications for parades, runs/walks, and other community events also became prominent. REACT Teams have added amateur, FRS, GMRS, Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS), Trunked radio systems, and business band radio (LMR) to their public service capabilities.

== Services provided ==
Each REACT Team functions within a limited locale. 

Many REACT Teams utilize their radio communications to provide services such as parking control, search and rescue support, assistance with large public events, safety breaks along highways, and support of local emergency management offices and law enforcement. Some Teams participate in the Skywarn program of storm spotters. All of these roles require the radio communications that REACT Teams offer.

== Objectives ==
*(a) To develop the use of personal radio services as an additional source of communications for emergencies, disasters, and as an emergency aid to individuals;
*(b) To establish 24-hour volunteer monitoring of emergency calls, particularly over officially designated emergency frequencies, from personal radio service operators, and report such calls to appropriate emergency authorities;
*(c) To promote transportation safety by developing programs that provide information and communications assistance to motorists;
*(d) To coordinate efforts with, and provide communications support to, other groups, (e.g., Red Cross, Emergency Management, local, state, and federal authorities,) during emergencies and disasters;
*(e) To develop, administer, and promote public information projects demonstrating and publicizing the potential benefits and the proper use of the personal radio service to individuals, organizations, industry, and government;
*(f) To participate in citizen crime prevention programs were established by law enforcement agencies.

<text>Coco/R is a compiler generator that takes wirth syntax notation grammars of a source language and generates a scanner and a parser for that language.

The scanner works as a deterministic finite automaton. It supports Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding and can be made case-sensitive or case-insensitive. It can also recognize tokens based on their right-hand-side context. In addition to terminal symbols the scanner can also recognize pragmas, which are tokens that are not part of the syntax but can occur anywhere in the input stream (e.g. compiler directives or end-of-line characters).

The parser uses recursive descent; LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by either a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k. Fuzzy parsing is supported by so-called ANY symbols that match complementary sets of tokens. Semantic actions are written in the same language as the generated scanner and parser. The parser&#x27;s error handling can be tuned by specifying synchronization points and &quot;weak symbols&quot; in the grammar. Coco/R checks the grammar for completeness, consistency, non-redundancy as well as for LL(1) conflicts.

There are versions of Coco/R for Java, C#, C++, Pascal, Modula-2, Modula-3, Delphi, VB.NET, Python, Ruby and other programming languages. The latest versions from the University of Linz are those for C#, Java and C++. For the Java version, there is an Eclipse plug-in and for C#, a Visual Studio plug-in. There are also sample grammars for Java and C#.

Coco/R was originally developed at the ETHZ and moved with Hanspeter Mössenböck to University of Linz when he got his appointment there. Coco/R is distributed under the terms of a slightly relaxed GNU General Public License.

<text>Peder Ludvik Kolstad (28 November 1878 – 5 March 1932) was a Norwegian politician from the Agrarian Party. He was the prime minister of Norway from 1931 until his death in 1932.

== Early life and education ==
Born to a farmer&#x27;s family in Borge, now part of Fredrikstad in Østfold county he got a degree from Kalnes school of agriculture in 1899 and a degree from the Agricultural University of Norway at Ås, Akershus county in 1902. He subsequently worked as teachers at agricultural schools in Asker, Akershus county and Nedenes, Aust-Agder county. Returning to Østfold and Kalnes school of agriculture in 1905, he became principal at the school in 1912.

== Early political and organizational career ==
In Østfold, Kolstad became engaged in organisational work related to agriculture. He served as leader of the Tune chapter of the Norwegian Agrarian Association, became leader of the Østfold county chapter and member of the national board of the organisation. He also sat on the board of the agricultural cooperative Felleskjøpet.

In the period from 1919 to 1922, he was part of the &quot;herredsstyre&quot; (selective body of the municipal council) in Tune. He was a member of the municipal council until 1928 and leader of the Østfold chapter of the Farmer&#x27;s Party for several years in the 1920s.

At the Agrarian Association&#x27;s congress in Kristiansand in 1920, he played an important role in the process that led to the decision that the organization should nominate its own list in the 1921 Norwegian parliamentary election, leading to the establishment of the Farmer&#x27;s Party.

In the 1921 Norwegian parliamentary election, Kolstad topped the list for the Farmers&#x27; Party in Østfold and was elected to the Parliament of Norway and subsequently re-elected in all elections until his death. He served in the Standing Committee on Finance in all his parliamentary career, becoming head of the committee in 1928. He served as secretary for the Farmers&#x27; Party&#x27;s parliamentary group in all his years in Parliament and was elected President of the Odelsting in 1931. In this period, he also headed the Østfold chapter of the Farmer&#x27;s Party for several years.

As finance politician, Kolstad like his party argued for austerity, in particular he wanted to reduce public administration He led the majority in the Farmer&#x27;s Party that supported the Liberal Mowinckel&#x27;s Cabinet&#x27;s decision to return the Norwegian krone to the gold standard in 1928 after convertibility had been suspended after World War I.

== As prime minister ==
Mowinckel&#x27;s Cabinet&#x27;s decision to grant the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever Concession to acquire half the shares in the Norwegian company Lilleborg caused a political crisis in 1931, leading to the resignation of the cabinet and the formation of the first cabinet from the Farmer&#x27;s Party.

The Farmers&#x27; Party had only 25 of the 150 seats in the Parliament; the weakest foundation for a cabinet in Norway to that date. The cabinet would seek support in the parliament from the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. The party chose Kolstad as prime minister instead of the party leader Jens Hundseid to a large degree because he was seen as being moderate and better at cooperating with other parties and politicians than Hundseid. The party also saw it as an advantage that he was well versed in financial policies.

=== Formation of the cabinet ===
Never having been in government before, the party lacked experienced persons for the ministerial positions. The Cabinet had 10 members. Kolstad took the position of Minister of Finance in addition to being prime minister. He set as an ultimatum that Jon Sundby should take the position as Minister of Agriculture; Sundby himself originally wanted to stay in the Parliament as leader of the Standing Committee on Agriculture. A controversial choice was major Vidkun Quisling as Minister of Defence. Quisling had not been involved in party politics and Sundby did not personally know him. Kolstad stated that Quisling&#x27;s knowledge about Russia as demonstrated in his writings would be useful for the cabinet.

=== The Lilleborg case ===
The Mowinckel Cabinet had granted the Norwegian company Lilleborg concession to buy De-No-Fa&#x27;s oil mill in Fredrikstad and at the same time given concession for De-No-Fa, which was 50% owned by the Dutch company Unilever, to acquire half the shared in Lilleborg. This would give Unilever control over Lilleborg. While the Farmer&#x27;s party opposed the concession as they wanted to protect Norwegian ownership of industry and it led to the fall of the Mowinkel Cabinet, Kolstad&#x27;s Cabinet found it impossible to revoke the concession. De-No-Fa stated the mill would have to close without a concession and at the same time De-No-Fa and Unilever had negotiated a new contract which would give Unilever control over Lilleborg even without a concession. On 10 July 1931, the Kolstad cabinet confirmed the concession that the Mowinckel&#x27;s Cabinet had already given.

=== Eastern Greenland dispute===
On 26 May 1923, the newly established &quot;Det Norske Ishavsråd&quot; (English: The Norwegian Arctic Council) published a proposal to 
that Norway should claim sovereignty over part of the area near Scoresbysund. Norwegian whalers and trappers stayed in the area. The Farmer&#x27;s Party had a post in their program that Norway should assert historical rights in Greenland and whaling interest in the Arctic Oceans. Nevertheless, Kolstad was initially negative to the proposal.

In June the same year, the cabinet got a telegram from Hallvard Devold who led a Norwegian expedition in Greenland which stated that Norwegians had occupied Myggbukta and declared the nearby area for Norwegian territory, calling it Erik the Red&#x27;s Land. After multiple cabinet discussions, the cabinet issued a royal declaration on 10 July 1931 where Eastern Greenland was claimed as Norwegian territory. The decision was met with condemnation from the Labour Party. Denmark contested the claim and brought the case to the International Court of Justice where they won in 1933.

=== The Menstad conflict ===
When Kolstad formed the cabinet in May 1931, the industry in Norway had been marked by strikes and lock-out since March. In Menstad near Porsgrunn, Norsk Hydro hired temporary workers to unload a number of ships. The union considered those workers to be strikebreakers. The cabinet sent 120 police officers to protect the workers. After the police officers were attacked by stones and sticks on 8 June, the cabinet sent military forces to the place – soldiers and four vessels – which calmed the situation. Although Quisling was not prominent in making the decision, as Minister of Defence the non-socialist parties gave him most of the credit while he became considered an enemy by the labour movement.

=== Economic and agricultural policies ===
To support Norwegian farmers, the cabinet proposed that all margarine sold in Norway should contain a certain percentage of butter. This was legalized in the Parliament in June 1923. The cabinet also proposed to increase the subsidies to farmers that produced corn. The Liberal Party initially opposed the increase, but after Kolstad threatened to resign over the issue a compromise was reached.

Following the United Kingdom&#x27;s decision to leave the gold standard in September 1923, the Kolstad cabinet decided to abandon the standard the same month. At the same time, the cabinet devaluated the Norwegian krone which sank more than most other currencies in Europe, which helped the Norwegian export.

In December 1923, Kolstad was informed that the large banks Bergens Privatbank and Den norske Creditbank were in grave financial troubles. The cabinet and a majority in the Parliament backed a plan by the Norwegian Central Bank to help the bank with liquidity, but Kolstad blamed the Central Bank for not having addressed the problem at an earlier stage and argued in favour of more political influence over the Central Bank.

== Health problems and death ==
Kolstad suffered various health problems during his time as prime minister and was hospitalised in January 1932. He died of a blood clot on 5 March 1932. Jens Hundseid became prime minister for a new Farmers&#x27; party government on 14 March.

== Personal life and legacy ==
Kolstad married Ingrid Mathiesen, daughter of an industrialist, in 1905. He was post mortem father-in-law to Liberal politician and women rights activist Eva Kolstad and the grandfather to film critic Harald Kolstad.

He was interred at Tune churchyard. A road in Sarpsborg is named after him.

In the book &quot;Norsk statsministre&quot; (English: Norwegian prime ministers) from 2010 edited by Gudleiv Forr and Per Egil Hegge, historians rated Kolstad as one of Norway&#x27;s weakest prime ministers with a grade of 2 on a scale from 1 to 6. The historians put weight on how long the person served as prime minister in their evaluation.

<doc id="862665" wikidata="Q1202818" url="?curid=862665" title="Aikō District, Kanagawa">
<text>is a district located in central Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It currently consists of only one town, Aikawa, and one village, Kiyokawa. The city of Atsugi was formerly part of Aikō District.

== Towns and villages ==
*Aikawa
*Kiyokawa

==History==

Aikō District was one of the ancient subdivisions of Sagami Province, extending from central Sagami north to the border of Musashi Province between the Sagami River and the Tanzawa Mountains. The district offices were located in what is now part of Atsugi. The area was part of a vast &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by the Ōe clan, and their descendants, the Mōri clan of Chōshū from the Heian period through the Sengoku period. It later became a contested area between the later Hōjō clan of Odawara and the Takeda clan of Kai. In the Edo period, it was nominally part of Odawara Domain, although large portions were &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled by the &quot;shōgun&quot; in Edo through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. From 1706, a branch of the Ōkubo clan in Odawara was permitted to establish the Ogino-Yamanaka Domain on a portion of the district. Other portions of the district came under control of Karasuyama Domain of Shimōsa Province.

With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Ogino-Yamanaka Domain came under the control of Shizuoka Domain, while remaining territories became part of the new Kanagawa Prefecture. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, former Ogino-Yamanaka Domain became Ogino-Yamanaka Prefecture, and subsequently part of the short-lived Ashigaru Prefecture. It merged with Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876.

===Timeline===
* The new Aikō and Tsukui Districts were established in 1878.
* In 1889, Aikō District was administratively divided into the following municipalities:
** one town (Atsugi)
** 16 villages (Koayu, Tamagawa, Nanmori, Mita, Tanasawa, Shimokawairi, Tsumada, Oikawa, Hayashi, Echi, Ogino, Aikawa, Takamine, Nakatsu, Susugaya and Miyagase)
* In 1940, Aikawa Village was elevated to town status.
* In 1946, Mutsuai Village was created through the merger of six villages (Mita, Tanasawa, Shimokawairi, Tsumada, Oikawa and Hayashi).
* In 1955:
** January 15 – The village of Takamine was absorbed into Aikawa.
** February 1 – The village of Mutsuai merged with the town of Atsugi and three other villages (Koayu, Tamagawa and Nanmori) to form the city of Atsugi.
** July 8 – The village of Echi was absorbed into Atsugi.
* In 1956:
** September 30 – Kiyokawa Village was created through the merger of two villages (Susugaya and Miyagase).
** September 30 – The village of Nakatsu was absorbed into Aikawa.
** September 30 – The village of Ogino was absorbed into Atsugi.

<text>Glenbrook North High School (also known as GBN) is a public high school in Northbrook, Illinois, a north suburb of Chicago, United States. It was established in 1953 and is part of the Northfield Township High School District 225.

In 2022, it was ranked the 48th-best public high school in the United States by Niche.

Feeder schools that attend GBN are Wood Oaks, Northbrook Junior High, Field (Northbrook portions), and Maple (Northbrook portions). GBN serves most of Northbrook, some unincorporated portions of Cook County, and a small section of Glenview.

== History ==
In 1930, Northbrook opened Northbrook High School to serve its residents. But as Northbrook grew due to American suburbanization, more space to accommodate students was needed, warranting its closure and the construction of a new high school.

===Founding===
Glenbrook North High School opened its doors in the fall of 1953 as Glenbrook High School, with its name being a combination of &quot;Northbrook&quot; and &quot;Glenview&quot;. After the opening of Glenbrook South High School in Glenview, the school was renamed to Glenbrook North. Subsequently, the two schools formed Glenbrook High School District 225.

Glenbrook North has grown fourfold in the size of its student body since its founding. In 1979, the school opened the Sheely Center for the Performing Arts, and in 1990, a fieldhouse was dedicated. In the spring of 1996, a three-year renovation and construction project involving the science facilities and the &quot;A&quot; wing was built. A second swimming pool was built in 2000 to accommodate the burgeoning growth in aquatics. A successful referendum in 2006 enabled renovation and addition to a second floor of the schools &quot;F&quot; wing, state of the art Fitness Center, complete renovation and additions to the Music Area, and a sun-filled main entrance, which were completed in 2009.

Throughout the years, Glenbrook North High School has received state and national recognition for its academic excellence. In the late 1950s, when Glenbrook was less than 10 years old, it was named one of the top 44 high schools in the country by a survey in a national magazine. In 1984, GBN was named one of only four high schools in the state of Illinois to receive the United States Office of Education Excellence in Education Award from President Ronald Reagan. In 2008, GBN was selected again for the nation&#x27;s top distinction as a Blue Ribbon School.

=== John Hughes films ===
John Hughes was an alumnus who used exteriors of the school in his film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Hughes also used other schools throughout the north Chicago suburbs for his &quot;Shermer, Illinois&quot; locations. Hughes used interiors of the school in his film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

=== President Clinton visit ===
On January 22, 1997, President Bill Clinton visited the school to deliver a speech about education initiatives. It was held in the school&#x27;s fieldhouse and largely centered around mathematics and science. At the time, students in Northern Illinois were participating in a program called &quot;First in the World.&quot; The program was to judge the level of knowledge in math and science against other schools around the world. Northern Illinois students scored 1st in the Science category and 3rd in the Mathematics category. Remarking about Glenbrook High School District 225, President Clinton said:

Can you imagine a school district or a set of school districts with more genuine local control than this one, with—more than these— more parental involvement, more committed teachers, more—you know, you&#x27;ve got local control. But you didn&#x27;t use it as an excuse not to throw your hat in the ring. I think it&#x27;s great that it came out this way. But if you had finished eighth and ninth, I would still be here to pat you on the back because you had the guts to do it.

Less than a month later, Bill Clinton referenced his visit to the school and these achievements in his 1997 State of the Union on February 4, 1997.

=== Student hazing incident ===
In May 2003, the school gained notoriety after an off-campus, non-school-sanctioned event involving students dressed in school colors turned into a major hazing incident that attracted national media attention. The event was a &quot;Powder Puff&quot; girls&#x27; football game between members of the junior and senior classes. The &quot;game&quot; took place on May 4, 2003, in Chipilly Woods, part of the Cook County Forest Preserve District. Although the annual Powder Puff game had been held at the school&#x27;s football stadium in earlier decades, there was no football at the 2003 event. During the event, about 20 junior class participants were covered in paint, urine, feces, and animal guts. Some were shot with paintball guns, others were kicked and beaten. At least five participants sustained injuries requiring medical attention.

Thirty-one students – twenty-eight females and three males – were suspended from school for 10 days. They were later expelled. Some of the expelled students and their parents filed a lawsuit to allow the expelled students to graduate. The plaintiffs and the school district reached an agreement where the expelled students would have their diplomas mailed to them but would not be able to participate in graduation ceremonies. Local law enforcement authorities investigated the hazing incident and filed charges against 15 students for assault and battery. Two mothers were charged with providing alcohol for the event. All were convicted and the sentences received were light, ranging from probation to community service.

A community-wide task force was established by the Northbrook Police Department Community Services Division after the hazing incident. Their final report stressed the needs for recognizing and preventing hazing incidents.

==Campus==
Glenbrook North is located at 2300 Shermer Road adjacent to Maple School. Glenbrook North is home to the Forrest S. Sheely Center for the Performing Arts (where the Northbrook Symphony performs) and has an additional &quot;little theater&quot; located in the schools basement. Within the athletics wing exists multiple pools, several gyms including a climbing and gymnastics gym, a fieldhouse, a fitness center, and outdoor tennis courts, fields (including for football), and tracks. There are two cafeterias; one for students and one for staff. Weather permitting, the central courtyard is open during lunch. At the back of the property is a 1.5 acre prairie.

==Diversity==
For the 2021 school year, 71.4% of students were White, 0.5% were Black, 5.4% were Hispanic, 17.9% were Asian, 0% were Native American, 0.1% were Pacific Islander, and 4.8% were of two or more races. The school also has a large Jewish population.

The school offers a variety of programs catering to students&#x27; heritage. For example, its language program includes less commonly taught languages such as Russian and Mandarin Chinese. Owing to the North Shore (Chicago)&#x27;s large Jewish population (see History of the Jews in Chicago), Hebrew was introduced in 2010 and Jewish Club was created. Other culture-focused clubs are Black Student Union, Foreign Films Club, Hellenic Club, and Pan-Asian Student Society. Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA) serves Glenbrook North&#x27;s LGBT population. There is also a feminist club.

== Academics ==

The academic school year consists of 37 weeks divided into two semesters. It has a block schedule with classes meeting on alternating days and each school day consists of four blocks of 90 minutes each. The summer school program is six weeks in length.

Honors level courses are offered to qualified students. Advanced Placement (AP) courses are available in a range of topics including English, history, math, science, art, music, computer science, and world languages.

In 2021, the school graduated 96% of its senior class, and 98% enrolled in college. The 2021 class included 14 National Merit Semifinalists and 176 Illinois State Scholars. The student-to-teacher ratio is 11.54 to 1.

In 2022, it was ranked the 48th best public high school in the United States by Niche. In 2016, it was ranked 23rd on the public high schools with the best teachers in America by Business Insider.

=== Debate ===
The school&#x27;s debate team was ranked the top debate school of the 20th century based on performance in the National Speech and Debate Association. The school has won numerous state and national championships in Policy Debate, as well as state championships in Lincoln-Douglas and Public Forum Debate. It is the only high school debate program in the country to have ever won the debate&#x27;s &quot;Triple Crown,&quot; sweeping the National Speech and Debate Association Tournament, the Tournament of Champions, and the Grand National Speech and Debate Tournament in 2004.

Since 1974, it has won at least one national championship in debate in fourteen individual years. It has also won an Illinois High School Association (IHSA) state championship in 18 of the 35 years since 1982, and has placed as runner up in three of those years.

Glenbrook North offers many sports including, but not limited to baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross-country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball. The school is a member of the Central Suburban League North and the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). William Lutz Stadium, which is the home of the Glenbrook North&#x27;s football, lacrosse, track and field and soccer teams, is named in honor of William Lutz, the school&#x27;s first athletic director.

<doc id="862673" wikidata="Q7850104" url="?curid=862673" title="Tsukui District, Kanagawa">
<text>was a district located in the far northwestern corner of Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

From 2007 it merged into the city of Sagamihara. Prior to its merger it consisted of four towns (Shiroyama, Tsukui, Sagamiko, Fujino), with a total area of 238.44 square kilometers and a population of 72,871. The district was located in the Tanzawa Mountains.

==History==

Tsukui District was regarded as a portion of Aikō District until the Meiji period, although as a regional name, “Tsukui” appears in Kamakura period and Sengoku period documents. During the Edo period, the area was largely &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo, although ruled as a patchwork of small fiefs held by various &quot;hatamoto,&quot; except for the brief period from 1663 to 1684, when the entire district was ruled by Sekiyado Domain. A portion of the district was also controlled by Odawara Domain.

After the Meiji restoration, the Shogunal and &quot;hatamoto&quot; holdings became part of the short-lived Nirayama Prefecture, which merged with Kanagawa Prefecture in 1869. The Odawara-ruled portion became part of the equally short-lived Odawara Prefecture, which merged into Ashigaru Prefecture in 1871, and then into Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876. 

In 1889, Tsukui District was organized into one town, 21 villages and 2 post stations. 

==Towns and villages==
Prior to its abolition, Tsukui District consisted of two towns:

*Fujino
*Shiroyama

==Mergers==
*On March 20, 2006 the towns of Sagamiko and Tsukui were merged into Sagamihara.
*On March 11, 2007 the towns of Fujino and Shiroyama were merged into Sagamihara.

===Merger problems===
*On February 19, 2006, the current mayor of Shiroyama was recalled for denying to join Sagamiko, Tsukui, and Fujino (scheduled to be merged with Sagamihara in the future) to merged into Sagamihara. Tsukui District failed to dissolve as a result of this recall election.
*The official dissolved date of this district was March 11, 2007, when Shiroyama and Fujino were merged into Sagamihara.

<doc id="862675" wikidata="Q869082" url="?curid=862675" title="1960 World Series">
<text>The 1960 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1960 season. The 57th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff that matched the National League (NL) champion Pittsburgh Pirates against the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees. In Game 7, Bill Mazeroski hit the series winning ninth-inning home run, the first time a winner-take-all World Series game ended with a home run, and the first World Series to end on a home run. Mazeroski&#x27;s home run gave the Pirates their third title overall and their first since 1925.

Despite losing the series, the Yankees scored 55 runs, the most runs scored by any one team in World Series history, and more than twice as many as the Pirates, who scored 27. The Yankees won three blowouts (16–3, 10–0, and 12–0), while the Pirates won four close games (6–4, 3–2, 5–2, and 10–9) to win the series. The Pirates&#x27; -28 run differential is the lowest ever by any team, winner or loser, in a World Series. The Series MVP was Bobby Richardson of the Yankees, the only time in history that the award has been given to a member of the losing team, though the rules were different at this time. Votes had to be in by the start of the 8th inning of Game 7, at which point the Yankees were in the lead, and this was the first time since the series MVP award was created in 1955 that the team leading at that point did not go on to win. Richardson was also the first non-pitcher to be named MVP.

This World Series featured seven past, present, or future league Most Valuable Players. The Pirates had two – Dick Groat (1960) and Roberto Clemente (1966) – while the Yankees had five: Yogi Berra (1951, 1954, 1955), Bobby Shantz (1952), Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, 1962), Roger Maris (1960, 1961), and Elston Howard (1963).

==Summary==
The Yankees, winners of their 10th pennant in 12 years, outscored the Pirates 55–27 in this Series, out-hit them 91–60, out-batted them .338 to .256, hit 10 home runs to Pittsburgh&#x27;s four (three of which came in Game 7), got two complete-game shutouts from Whitey Ford—and lost. The Pirates&#x27; inconsistent pitching and Yankees&#x27; manager Casey Stengel&#x27;s controversial decision not to start Ford in Games 1 and 4 resulted in the peculiar combination of close games and routs. Ford (Games 3 and 6) and Vern Law (Games 1 and 4) were excellent, while Pirates relief pitcher Roy Face was a major factor in Games 1, 4 and 5. The Yankees also committed twice as many errors as the Pirates in the series. The Yankees had 8 errors while the Pirates had four errors.

==Matchups==

===Game 1===


The Yankees threw Art Ditmar against the Pirates&#x27; Vern Law (the NL Cy Young Award winner) in Game 1. In the top of the first inning, New York right fielder Roger Maris, the eventual 1960 AL MVP, drilled a home run off Law to give the Yankees a 1–0 lead. In the bottom half, however, the Pirates evened the score when Bill Virdon walked, stole second, advanced to third on an error by shortstop Tony Kubek, and scored on a double by eventual National League Most Valuable Player Dick Groat. Bob Skinner then singled to drive in Groat and stole second, coming home on a single by Roberto Clemente. Pittsburgh now led 3–1. This was enough to compel Casey Stengel, the Yankee manager, to pull Ditmar in favor of Jim Coates, who finished the inning.

In the fourth, New York cut the lead to one run when Maris singled, moved to second on a Mickey Mantle walk, took third on a fly out by Yogi Berra, and scored on a single by Bill Skowron. But the Pirates extended their lead to 5–2 in the fourth when Don Hoak walked and Bill Mazeroski homered. Pittsburgh added an insurance run in the sixth when Mazeroski doubled with one out and scored on Virdon&#x27;s double off Duke Maas, and although the Yankees cut the lead in half on a ninth-inning 2-run home run to right field by Elston Howard, reliever Roy Face successfully closed it out to give the Pirates a 6–4 victory and a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===


Game 2, matching New York&#x27;s Bob Turley against the Pirates&#x27; Bob Friend, saw the Yankees pummel Pittsburgh 16–3.

The game was scoreless until the top of the third, when the Yankees jumped out to a 2–0 lead. Second baseman Bobby Richardson walked, was sacrificed over to second by Turley, and scored on a single by Tony Kubek. Gil McDougald then doubled, plating Kubek all the way from first base. Turley aided his own cause with an RBI single in the fourth, driving home Richardson, who had singled and moved to second on a passed ball. Although Hoak doubled home Gino Cimoli in the bottom of the fourth to break the shutout, the Yankees extended their lead to 5–1 courtesy of a two-run home run by Mantle off Fred Green.

In the sixth, the solid Yankee lead turned into a rout. Elston Howard hit a lead-off triple and scored on Bobby Richardson&#x27;s double to chase Green from the game. Clem Labine replaced Green. A passed ball by Smoky Burgess and error by shortstop Dick Groat on Tony Kubek&#x27;s ground ball put runners on first and third with one out before McDougald&#x27;s RBI single made it 7–1 Yankees. After a walk and strikeout, Yogi Berra&#x27;s two-run single and Bill Skowron&#x27;s RBI single made it 10–1 Yankees. Red Witt relieved Labine and allowed back-to-back RBI singles to Howard and Richardson that made it 12–1 Yankees. Mantle continued the onslaught by blasting a three-run home run in the seventh off Joe Gibbon and scoring on a wild pitch by Tom Cheney in the ninth after walking and moving to third on a double, making it 16–1 Yankees. Although the Pirates tacked on two runs in the bottom half of the frame on back-to-back RBI singles by Gino Cimoli and Smoky Burgess, Bobby Shantz relieved Turley and got Don Hoak to hit into the game-ending double play. This decisive Yankee victory tied the series at a game apiece.

===Game 3===


For Game 3, the Series shifted to Yankee Stadium as Stengel sent Whitey Ford to the mound against Pittsburgh&#x27;s Vinegar Bend Mizell. Ford had somewhat of an off year (12–9, 3.08 ERA and 192.2 IP) for his lofty standards, but was brilliant against the Pirates.

The Yankees continued the offensive onslaught they displayed in Game 2, grabbing a 6–0 lead by the end of the first inning. Mizell would only get one batter out. After two singles, Bill Skowron drove in the first run with an RBI single. After a walk loaded the bases, Elston Howard added another run with an RBI single off Clem Labine before Bobby Richardson capped the scoring with a grand slam (during the regular season, Richardson had hit only one home run, off Baltimore&#x27;s Arnie Portocarrero on April 30). The next time a first inning World Series Grand slam would be hit would be in the 2021 World Series, 61 years later. In the fourth, the Bronx Bombers added on four more runs, courtesy of a two-run home run by Mickey Mantle off Fred Green and—after three singles had loaded the bases—a two-run single by Richardson off Red Witt. The Pirates, meanwhile, could not get anything going against Ford, who tossed a masterful four-hitter. The Yankees now led the series 2–1.

===Game 4===


The Pirates had seen their pitching fail them in the last two games, as the team fell victim to the powerful Yankee bats. This was not the case in Game 4, however, as Pittsburgh sent Game 1 winner Vern Law to the hill against Ralph Terry.

The game was scoreless until the bottom of the fourth, when Bill Skowron launched a home run off Law to give New York a 1–0 advantage. The very next half-inning, though, Pittsburgh stormed back, when with two on and two outs, Law doubled in Gino Cimoli to tie the game and Bill Virdon&#x27;s two-run single put the Pirates up 3–1. Law kept the potent pinstripers at bay, though the Yankees did scratch and claw for a single run in the bottom of the seventh when Skowron doubled, moved to third on a single by McDougald, and scored on a fielder&#x27;s choice on a ball hit by Richardson. After a pinch-hit single by Johnny Blanchard, Pirate manager Danny Murtaugh brought in reliever Roy Face, who held the fort for the final innings as Pittsburgh tied the series at two games apiece to ensure a return to Forbes Field.

===Game 5===


With the series now tied at two, Yankee manager Casey Stengel started pitcher Art Ditmar, his Game 1 starter (in which he was ineffective), against the Pirates&#x27; Harvey Haddix, who had become famous for taking a perfect game into the thirteenth inning in a loss to the Milwaukee Braves the previous year.

As it turned out, on this day Ditmar could not get out of the second inning once again. Dick Stuart singled and was forced out at second on a fielder&#x27;s choice hit by Gino Cimoli, who then moved to third on a double by Smoky Burgess. Don Hoak then slapped a ground ball toward Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek, who flipped it to third baseman Gil McDougald in an attempt to retire Burgess, who was attempting to advance. However, McDougald dropped the ball for an error (Kubek&#x27;s toss was accurate), allowing Cimoli to score, with Burgess safe at third, and Hoak reaching second on the error. Bill Mazeroski then lashed a double to left, scoring Burgess and Hoak. After this offensive outburst, Stengel yanked Ditmar and replaced him with Luis Arroyo, who finally ended the inning and stranded Mazeroski.

The next half-inning, New York picked up a run when Elston Howard doubled, moved to third on a ground-out by Bobby Richardson, and scored on another grounder by Kubek. However, the Pirates extended their lead back to three runs in the third, when Roberto Clemente singled home Groat, who led off with a double.

In the bottom of the third, Roger Maris touched Haddix for a home run to deep right field. Otherwise, however, the Pittsburgh hurler was in fine form, holding the Yankees at bay until the seventh, when he was replaced by Face. In the ninth, the Pirates added an insurance run off Ryne Duren. Smoky Burgess had singled and taken second on an error; he was replaced at second by pinch-runner Joe Christopher, who moved to third on a wild pitch, and was singled in by Hoak. Face then shut down the Yankees once again to give the Pirates a 5–2 victory and 3–2 series lead.

===Game 6===


For the sixth contest in Pittsburgh, the Yankees started Whitey Ford against the Pirates&#x27; Bob Friend. And as was the case the last time Ford had toed the rubber for the Yanks in Game 3, his teammates relentlessly mashed the ball, en route to a resounding 12–0 victory.

In the top of the second, the Yankees went to work. After a Yogi Berra walk and a Bill Skowron single, Elston Howard was hit by a pitch to load the bases (Eli Grba ran for him). Ford himself then notched the first RBI of the game, with a ground ball single to his counterpart Friend that scored Berra. The next inning, after a lead-off hit-by-pitch and double, Mantle cracked a two-run single that scored Tony Kubek and Roger Maris. After a Yogi Berra single moved Mantle to third, Pirates skipper Danny Murtaugh removed the clearly ineffective Friend in favor of Tom Cheney. Cheney, however, fared no better, as a Bill Skowron sacrifice fly scored Mantle and, after a single, a Richardson triple to deep left field scored Berra and Johnny Blanchard, making the score 6–0.

The Yankees then ran away with the game, scoring two runs in each of the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings. In the sixth, Clete Boyer hit a lead-off triple off Fred Green and scored on Kubek&#x27;s single. After another single, Berra&#x27;s RBI single off Clem Labine made it 8–0 Yankees. Next inning, after a lead-off double by Blanchard, Richardson ripped his second RBI triple of the contest, and Ford added his second RBI courtesy of a fielder&#x27;s choice on a sacrifice bunt. In the eighth, Berra hit an RBI single with a runner on second, and later scored on Blanchard&#x27;s double. As in Game 3, Ford was his masterful self, not letting the Pirates mount anything resembling a rally for the full nine innings. His second shutout of the series was critical, as it forced Game 7. Yankee manager Casey Stengel would come under fire in Mickey Mantle&#x27;s autobiography for letting Ford finish this game—instead of removing him once the Yankees had a comfortable lead—thus making him unavailable out of the bullpen if needed in Game 7.

===Game 7===


For the deciding seventh game, Bob Turley, the winning pitcher in Game 2, got the nod for the Yankees against the Pirates&#x27; Vern Law, the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 4.

Turley lasted only one inning plus one batter. After retiring the first two batters, Turley walked Bob Skinner, then first baseman Rocky Nelson homered, Pittsburgh&#x27;s first home run since Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s in Game 1, to give the Pirates a 2–0 lead. Turley was then pulled after giving up a single to Smoky Burgess leading off the second. Don Hoak then drew a walk against Bill Stafford, and a bunt single by Mazeroski loaded the bases. Stafford appeared to get the Yankees out of trouble after inducing Law to hit into a double play, pitcher to catcher to first. But lead-off man Bill Virdon&#x27;s single to right scored Hoak and Mazeroski and increased the Pirates&#x27; lead to 4–0.

The Yankees got on the board in the fifth on Bill Skowron&#x27;s lead-off home run, his second of the Series. In the sixth, Bobby Richardson led off with a single and Tony Kubek drew a walk. Elroy Face relieved Law and got Roger Maris to pop out to Hoak in foul territory, but Mickey Mantle singled to score Richardson. Face then blew the save when Yogi Berra followed with a three-run shot to right that gave the Yankees their first lead, 5–4.

The Yankees extended their lead to 7–4 in the eighth with two more runs off Face. With two out, Berra walked, and Skowron singled when the Pirates couldn&#x27;t get a force-out. Johnny Blanchard (who had replaced Elston Howard at catcher for game 7) then singled to score Berra, and Clete Boyer doubled to score Skowron.

But the Pirates retook the lead with a 5-run eighth inning. Gino Cimoli (pinch-hitting for Face) led off with a single, and Virdon hit a ground ball to short for what could have been a double play. But the ball instead took a bad hop and hit Kubek in the throat, leaving everybody safe and knocking the wind out of Kubek. He eventually got up, and game footage showed him arguing with manager Stengel, seemingly insisting he was ok to stay in the game. He was eventually coaxed off the field and replaced. He was taken to a hospital and kept overnight for observation due to concerns surrounding his trachea swelling up and thus, causing difficulty breathing. Back on the field, Dick Groat then chased Bobby Shantz (who had entered the game in the third and had pitched five innings, having not pitched more than four in any game during the regular season) with a single to score Cimoli and send Virdon to second. Jim Coates relieved Shantz and got Skinner out on a sacrifice bunt, which moved the runners up. Nelson followed with a fly ball to right, and Virdon declined to challenge Maris&#x27; throwing arm. Coates then got two quick strikes on Roberto Clemente and was a strike away from getting the Yankees out of their most serious trouble of the afternoon, when Clemente hit a Baltimore chop towards first; first baseman Skowron and Coates both tried to get to the ball at the same time, and Clemente&#x27;s speed forced Skowron to just hold the ball as Coates could not make it to first base in time to cover. The high chopper allowed Virdon to score, cutting the Yankee lead to 7–6. Hal Smith, who had replaced Smoky Burgess at catcher after being pinch-ran for by Joe Christopher followed with a three-run home run to give the Pirates a 9–7 lead. Game 4 loser Ralph Terry relieved Coates and got the last out.

Bob Friend, an 18-game winner for the Pirates and their starter (and loser) in Games 2 and 6, came on in the ninth to try to protect the lead. Bobby Richardson and pinch-hitter Dale Long both greeted him with singles, and Pirates manager Danny Murtaugh was forced to remove the veteran pitcher in favor of Harvey Haddix. Although he got Roger Maris to foul out, Haddix gave up a key single to Mickey Mantle that scored Richardson and moved Long to third. Yogi Berra followed, hitting a sharp grounder to first, with Rocky Nelson easily getting the second out. In what, at the moment, appeared to be a monumental play, Mantle, seeing he had no chance to beat a play at second, faked a step toward second base and then dove head-first back to first, narrowly avoiding Nelson&#x27;s tag (which would have been the third out) as Gil McDougald (pinch-running for Long) raced home to tie the game at 9-9. Had Mantle been out on the play, the run would likely not have counted since the play happened so quickly that the runner on third might not have crossed the plate before the out was recorded. With Mantle safe, the inning continued, but ended when Bill Skowron hit into a force play.

Ralph Terry returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth. The first batter to face him was Bill Mazeroski. With a count of one ball and no strikes, the Pirates&#x27; second baseman smashed a historic long drive over the left field wall for his second home run of the Series (left fielder Berra had no chance to catch it despite following it to the wall), winning the game 10–9 and crowning the Pirates as World Series champions. As the Pirates erupted, the Yankees stood across the field in stunned disbelief. The improbable champions were outscored, out-hit, and outplayed, but somehow had managed to pull out a Game 7 victory. Years later, Mickey Mantle was quoted in Ken Burns&#x27; documentary &quot;Baseball&quot; as saying that losing the 1960 series was the only loss, amateur or professional, he cried actual tears over. For Bill Mazeroski, by contrast, his Series-clinching home run was the highlight of a Hall of Fame career otherwise notable mostly for excellent defense.

Mazeroski became the first player to end the World Series with a home run. Thirty-three years later, Joe Carter would become the only other player to end the World Series with a home run, doing so for the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series against the Pirates&#x27; in-state rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies, albeit in Game 6. Mazeroski remains the only player to end a Game 7 of the World Series with a home run, and is one of just two players to hit a walk-off home run in a Game 7 of any postseason series (Aaron Boone is the other, doing so for the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox).

Because of the game’s back-and-forth nature (especially in the eighth and ninth innings) and historic conclusion, the game is considered by some to be the greatest game in MLB history, as well as one of the greatest games in the history of professional sports. Although most noted for the series-ending homer, Game 7 is also the only game in all of postseason history with no strikeouts recorded by either side. Three teams in the expansion era (since 1961) went a whole postseason game without striking out - the Pirates in 1974 (Game 2 of NLDS), the Anaheim Angels in 2002 (Game 2 of World Series), and the New York Mets in 2024 (Game 5 of NLCS) - although each of these teams struck out their opponents in these games at least once.

Bobby Richardson of the Yankees was named MVP of the Series, the only time someone from the losing team has been so honored. He batted .367 with 12 RBIs and eight runs in the Series and hit the key grand slam in Game 3.

====Game 7 telecast====
Prior to the mid-1970s, television networks and stations generally did not preserve their telecasts of sporting events, choosing instead to tape over them. As a result, the broadcasts of the first six games are no longer known to exist. The lone exception is a black-and-white kinescope of the entire telecast of Game 7, which was discovered in a wine cellar in Bing Crosby&#x27;s former home in Hillsborough, California, in December 2009.

A part-owner of the Pirates who was too superstitious to watch the Series live, Crosby listened to the decisive contest with his wife Kathryn and two friends on a shortwave radio in Paris, France. Wanting to watch the game at a later date only if the Pirates won, he arranged for the telecast to be recorded by Ampex, in which he also held a financial investment. After viewing the kinescope, he placed it in his wine cellar, where it sat untouched for 49 years. It was finally found by Robert Bader, vice-president of marketing and production for Bing Crosby Enterprises, while looking through videotapes of Crosby&#x27;s television specials which were to be transferred to DVD. The five-reel set is the only known complete copy of the historic game, which was originally broadcast in color.

The NBC television announcers for the Series were Bob Prince and Mel Allen, the primary play-by-play voices for the Pirates and Yankees respectively. Prince called the first half of Game 7 and conducted post-game interviews in the Pittsburgh clubhouse, while Allen did the latter portion of the game.

==50th anniversary celebrations==

On October 13, 2010, for the 50th anniversary of the series winning home run, a gala was hosted by the Byham Theater in downtown Pittsburgh, where the historic telecast of Game 7 was re-aired in its entirety. Bill Virdon, 1960 MVP Dick Groat and Yankee Bobby Richardson were guest speakers, with actor and Pittsburgh native Jeff Goldblum hosting the event. The MLB Network would air the game and gala on December 15, 2010. The telecast was also released on DVD by A&amp;E Home Video.

1960 World Series (4–3): Pittsburgh Pirates (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.)
==Aftermath==
This would prove to be Casey Stengel&#x27;s last World Series, as the Yankees soon sent him into retirement. This led to his famous remark, &quot;I&#x27;ll never make the mistake of turning 70 again.&quot; Mazeroski and Clemente were the last two remaining Pirates players from the 1960 World Series winners along with manager Danny Murtaugh and third-base coach Frank Oceak, when the Pirates won the World Series in 1971.

To date, this is the last championship in any of the four major sports to be won in Pittsburgh by the home team, as the Pirates&#x27; two subsequent World Series championships in 1971 and 1979, both against the Baltimore Orioles, were clinched at Memorial Stadium. The Pittsburgh Penguins have won all five of their Stanley Cup titles on the road, and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won all six of their Super Bowl championships at neutral sites, as is customary in the NFL.

<text>Jean Paul Lemieux, (; 1904 - 1990) was one of the foremost twentieth century painters in Canada. He worked in several different styles, as represented by his five artistic periods.

== Biography ==
He was born in Quebec City, where he also died. He was raised in Quebec City until 1916, when his family moved to Berkeley, California. In 1917, the family returned to Quebec and settled in Montreal.

As a youth, Lemieux created watercolours, taking lessons in his teens from an &quot;English lady&quot; in Montreal. From 1926 to 1934, Jean Paul Lemieux studied with Edwin Holgate and others at the Montreal School of Fine Arts. In 1929, he traveled to Europe with his mother. In Paris, he studied advertising and art and met other artists. Lemieux took teaching positions from 1934, first at his former school, then in 1935 at the École du meuble. In 1937, he moved to Quebec City and taught at the École des Beaux-Arts de Québec until his retirement in 1965. 

His connections at that period include other major artists associated with these schools, such as Alfred Pellan and Paul-Émile Borduas. In 1960, works by Lemieux along with Edmund Alleyn, Graham Coughtry, Frances Loring and Albert Dumouchel represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In 1967, he had his first major retrospective of over 100 paintings organized by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, which toured to the Musée du Québec (now MNBAQ) and the National Gallery of Canada. 

=== Awards and honors ===
Jean Paul Lemieux received several awards for his works, including the Louis-Philippe Hébert prize in 1971 and the Molson Prize for the Canada Council for the Arts in 1974. In 1968, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was also a member of the Royal Canadian Academy. In 1997, he was posthumously made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

== Artistic career ==

Lemieux was a representational artist whose painting career sometimes had echoes of folk art but, in 1956, at the age of 52, he changed his subject matter and refined his technique. The paintings which followed are among his best known. They usually feature emblematic scenes of French Canada, often combined with a sense of the vast spaces of his homeland.

=== Works - a selection ===
*&quot;Marine, Baie Saint-Paul&quot;, 1935
*&quot;Notre-Dame protégeant Québec&quot;, 1941
*&quot;Portrait de l’artiste à Beauport-Est&quot;, 1943
*&quot;Le Far West&quot;, 1955
*&quot;Les Parques&quot;, 1962
*&quot;L’été de 1914&quot;, 1965
*&quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh&quot;, 1979
*&quot;Dies Irae&quot;, 1982–83

=== The five periods ===
The Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec and other sources divide Lemieux&#x27;s career into five periods:

* Montreal period (1926–1937), marked by realistic naturalism influenced by Quebec regionalism and, later, European post impressionism.
* Primitive period (1940–1947), focused on anecdote and accumulated scenic detail.
* Minimalist period (1951–1955), with cubist structures, which signaled a major turning point in the artist&#x27;s career.
* Classical period (1956–1970), with a figures fuelled by the sources and practices of abstract art (MNBAQ). It is in this period that Lemieux produced the paintings of lonely figures in desolate, bleak landscapes for which he is so well known today.
* Expressionist period (after 1970), presenting humanity living in a post nuclear attack world.

== Legacy ==

A set of postage stamps depicting three works by Lemieux, &quot;Self-portrait&quot; (1974), &quot;June Wedding&quot; (1972) and &quot;Summer&quot; (1959) were issued by Canada Post on October 22, 2004. The stamps were released on the day that a retrospective of his work organized to recognize the centenary of the artist&#x27;s birth opened at the National Gallery of Canada. The Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec (abbreviated as MNBAQ) held the exhibition &quot;Jean Paul Lemieux: Silence and Space&quot; in 2022.

The Jean Paul Lemieux and Madeleine Des Rosiers fonds, R6612, is in Library and Archives Canada.

<text>Leopold Anton Johann Sigismund Josef Korsinus Ferdinand Graf Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz, Frättling und Püllütz (, ) (18 April 1863 – 21 November 1942) was an Austro-Hungarian politician, diplomat and statesman who served as Imperial Foreign Minister at the outbreak of World War I.

== Life==
===Early life===
Born in Vienna on 18 April 1863 as the son of Count Sigismund Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz, Frättling und Püllütz (1834–1900) and his wife, Countess Josephine von Trauttmansdorff-Weinsberg (1835–1894). He belonged to a wealthy Austrian noble family that owned lands in Moravia and Hungary. He was reputed to be one of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s richest men. 

His paternal grandparents were Count Siegmund Andreas Corsinus Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz and Countess Ludmilla Maria Theresia Wratislavová z Mitrowicz. His maternal grandparents were Franz Joseph Ferdinand von Trauttmansdorff-Weinsberg (grandson of Prince Ferdinand von Trauttmansdorff) and Countess Josephine Károlyi de Nagykárolyi.

Tutored at home, he later studied law and joined the Austro-Hungarian foreign service in 1893. 

=== Career ===
After his 1893 marriage, he served at the embassies in Paris (1894), London (1899) and St. Petersburg (1903). In December 1906, Count Berchtold was appointed as the successor of Count Alois von Aehrenthal as Ambassador to Russia upon the latter&#x27;s appointment as imperial foreign minister. He served with distinction for five years in St. Petersburg and experienced Russia&#x27;s distrust and fear of Vienna. In September 1908, he hosted a secret meeting between Aehrenthal and the Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky at his estate at Buchlau in Moravia. This meeting produced the so-called Buchlau bargain and led to the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

At the death of Aehrenthal in February 1912, Count Berchtold was appointed as his successor and thus became, at the age of 49, the youngest foreign minister in Europe. His appointment reportedly came against his own will and despite lack of experience in domestic affairs, as well as in military matters.

=== Balkan Wars ===

As imperial foreign minister, Count Berchtold focused almost exclusively on the Balkans where his foreign policy aims were to maintain peace, stick to the principle of non-intervention and preserve the territorial status quo. The Balkan Wars in 1912/1913, however, quickly made such a policy illusory.

At the outset of the Balkan Wars, Count Berchtold pursued a hard-line policy and flirted with the idea of war against Serbia, but vacillated and pulled back from intervention at the last moment. Although he managed to prevent Serbia from securing an outlet to the Adriatic Sea by support given to the creation of Albania, the Balkan Wars resulted in a failure to contain the rising Russian influence in the Balkans and thwart Serbian ambitions for a united Yugoslav state. It meant diplomatic defeat for Austria-Hungary and also a reputation of being weak and indecisive for Count Berchtold.

Count Berchtold&#x27;s focus on Serbia was grown out of a fear of Serbian territorial expansion in the Balkans and also a complication of frictional matters within the multinational Dual Monarchy, and would eventually result in the dissolution of the empire itself.

=== July Crisis ===

Following the Balkan Wars, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 was therefore a culmination of the heightened tension between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. If Count Berchtold had been accused of indecisiveness and diffidence during the Balkan Wars, he gave proof of more resolve during the July Crisis. Pushed by the so-called Young Rebels at the Ballhausplatz led by Count Hoyos, his chef de cabinet, Count Berchtold seized the opportunity to launch punitive action against Serbia and deal the country a mortal blow.

After having dispatched Count Hoyos on a mission to Berlin on 5 July to secure German support for Austria-Hungary&#x27;s future actions, which resulted in the famous &quot;blank cheque&quot;, he became the leading spokesman, together with the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff General Conrad von Hötzendorf, for war against Serbia during the meeting of the Imperial Crown Council on 7 July. Through the moderating influence of the Hungarian Minister-President Count István Tisza, who had reservations on the use of force against Serbia, it was decided to present Serbia with an ultimatum. The ten-point ultimatum was presented to Emperor Franz Joseph on 21 July and transmitted to Belgrade on 23 July. The previous night, according to his wife Nadine&#x27;s testimony, Count Berchtold spent a sleepless night, altering the ultimatum and adding clauses, as he was very worried the Serbs could accept it. The Serbian government accepted all points of the ultimatum but the one that permitted Austro-Hungarian authorities to participate in the investigation of the assassination on Serbian territory, which would have been a severe violation of Serbian sovereignty and the country&#x27;s constitution. As the acceptance of all 10 demands listed in the ultimatum was required, the Austro-Hungarian government made a decision to enter a state of war with Serbia on 28 July, for which he was largely to blame.

=== World War I ===

Once war had started, Count Berchtold focused his efforts on the question of Italy&#x27;s participation, the outcome of which would lead to his downfall. The main problem was Italy&#x27;s demands for territorial compensation in exchange for remaining within the Triple Alliance. When Rome presented the Ballhausplatz with demands for control over territories in southern Austria-Hungary, Berchtold demurred and refused to offer any Habsburg concessions, especially not in the Trentino.

However, Italian Foreign Minister Baron Sidney Sonnino succeeded in obtaining vague promises of compensations in South Tyrol from Germany and by the end of 1914, Count Berchtold informed the Crown Council that the choice was either acceptance of the Italian demands or a declaration of war. Both Count Tisza and General Conrad von Hötzendorf expressed a preference for the latter. Under mounting German pressure, Count Berchtold, however, indicated that he was ready to cede the Trentino and parts of the Albanian coastline. When he informed Tisza and Conrad of the concessions he was ready to give, they forced him to resign on 13 January 1915. At Count Tisza&#x27;s insistence he was replaced by the more pugnacious Count Burián.

Berchtold played no further public role during the war, although he was appointed Lord High Steward to Archduke Charles, the heir apparent, in March 1916, and became Lord Chamberlain following the latter&#x27;s accession to the throne in November. 
Count Berchtold had been invested as a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1912 and bestowed with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen in 1914.

After the war, he retired as a grand seigneur on his estate at Peresznye near Csepreg in Hungary.

===Personal life===

On 25 January 1893 in Budapest, he married Countess Ferdinanda Károlyi de Nagykároly (1868–1955), the daughter of Countess Franciska &quot;Fanni&quot; Erdödy and Count Alajos Károlyi, one of the richest aristocrats in Hungary who served as the Austrian ambassador to the German Empire and the United Kingdom. Her maternal aunt, Countess Hanna Erdödy, was the wife of Count Béla Széchenyi von Sárvár-Felsövidék, a &quot;personal friend&quot; of King Edward VII. Together, they were the parents of two sons: 

* Count Aloys &quot;Louis&quot; Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz (1894–1977), who never married.
* Count Adalbert &quot;Bela&quot; Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz (1895–1906), who died young.
* Count Sigismund &quot;Sziga&quot; Berchtold von und zu Ungarschitz (1900–1979), who married Countess Maria Anna &quot;Etti&quot; Esterházy ( von Wurmbrand-Stuppach), the former wife of Clendenin J. Ryan, Count Paul Pálffy ab Erdöd, and Count Tamás Esterházy, in 1944. They divorced in 1949 and she married William Deering Davis and then Árpád Plesch. Sziga then married Emilia de Gosztonyi (former wife of Michael Bankier and Robin Alexander Lyle) in 1953. After their divorce in 1956, she married Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia. Sziga then married Eva Machan, the former wife of Count Leopold zu Hardegg auf Glatz und im Machlande, in 1967.

Berchtold died at Peresznye on 21 November 1942 and was buried in the family tomb at Buchlau.

== Legacy ==
Count Berchtold was described at the time as &quot;intelligent and hard-working&quot; and possessed of a &quot;great personal charm&quot; that made him well-liked at court. Indeed, he possessed all the social graces required at the Hofburg and impressed with his aristocratic background. However he lacked the strength of character and broad experience that would have been desirable in an imperial foreign minister. This contributed to quick reversals of decisions, giving rise to a foreign policy often perceived as inconsistent and vacillating.

Many historians have regarded him as indecisive and diffident. However, during the July Crisis this appears not to have been the case as he &quot;commanded and managed the process&quot; on this occasion. His responsibility for the outbreak of the First World War has been much debated by historians. Without a doubt, he played a leading role in the intransigent formulation in the ultimatum of 23 July, the declaration of war on 28 July, and the rebuttal of Grey&#x27;s mediation proposal on 29 July. He believed that only the defeat of Serbia could preserve the Dual Monarchy. Despite that, he was not thought of as a warmonger by, for example, General Conrad von Hötzendorf. At the same time, his lack of self-confidence at the helm of Austro-Hungarian diplomacy made him susceptible to persuasion by his pro-war staff at the Ballhausplatz, on whose advice and opinions he was heavily dependent.

Although Berchtold may have personally pushed for war, the main question is whether he appreciated that a war against Serbia carried the risk of a major European war. According to G. A. Tunstall Jr, &quot;a Russian intervention doesn&#x27;t seem to had been taken into much consideration by the Austro-Hungarian leaders during the decision-making process&quot;. In any case, &quot;if he did not apprehend the consequences of his policies sufficiently, he was, however, not alone; as a matter of fact, there were few diplomats at the time who actually did&quot;.

=== In film and television ===
Count Berchtold was portrayed by actor John Gielgud in the 1969 film &quot;Oh! What A Lovely War&quot;.

<doc id="862681" wikidata="Q535876" url="?curid=862681" title="Sheehan's syndrome">
<text>Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock (ischemic necrosis) or stroke, originally described during or after childbirth leading to decreased functioning of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism). Classically, in the milder partial form, the mother is unable to breastfeed her baby, due to failure of the pituitary to secrete the hormone prolactin, and also has no more periods, because FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone) are not secreted. Although postmenopausal, the mother with this milder form of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome does not experience hot flushes, because the pituitary fails to secrete FSH (high levels of FSH, secreted by the pituitary in healthy postmenopausal women is an attempt to trigger ovulation, and these high levels of FSH cause hot the flushes). The failure to breastfeed and amenorrhea no more periods, were seen as the syndrome (a collection of symptoms), but we now view Sheehan&#x27;s as the pituitary failing to secrete 1-5 of the 9 hormones that it normally produces (the anterior (front) lobe of the pituitary produces FSH, LH, prolactin, ACTH (Adreno-cortico-trophic hormone),TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and GH (Growth Hormone); the posterior (the lobe at the back) pituitary produces ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) and Oxytocin, i.e. the pituitary is involved in the regulation of many hormones. It is very important to recognise Sheehan&#x27; stroke as, the ACTH deficiency Sheehan&#x27;s in the presence of the stress of a bacterial infection, such as a urine infection, will result in death of the mother from Addisonian crisis. This gland is located on the under-surface of the brain, the shape of a cherry and the size of a chickpea and sits in a pit or depression of the sphenoid bone known as the sella turcica (the Turk&#x27;s saddle). The pituitary gland works in conjunction with the hypothalamus, and other endocrine organs to modulate numerous bodily functions including growth, metabolism, menstruation, lactation, and even the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response. These endocrine organs, (like the thyroid gland in the neck, or adrenals on the upper pole of the kidneys), release hormones in very specific pathways, known as hormonal axes. For example, the release of a hormone in the hypothalamus will target the pituitary to trigger the release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the pituitary&#x27;s released hormone (TSH) will target the next organ in the pathway i.e. the thyroid to release thyroxin. Hence, damage to the pituitary gland can have downstream effects on any of the aforementioned bodily functions.

==Signs and symptoms==
The various signs and symptoms in Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome are caused by damage to the pituitary, thereby causing a decrease in one or more of the hormones it normally secretes. Since the pituitary controls many glands in the endocrine system, partial or complete loss of a variety of functions may result. Many of the signs and symptoms of Sheehan&#x27;s are considered &quot;nonspecific&quot; in the medical community; in other words these signs and symptoms are seen in a number of different disease processes, and are not specific to a singular disease or syndrome.

In some cases, a woman with Sheehan syndrome may be relatively asymptomatic initially; therefore, the diagnosis would not be made until years later when features of hypopituitarism become evident. In rare instances this syndrome can present acutely with unstable vital signs, dangerously low blood glucose levels, heart failure, or even psychosis. Hypopituitarism can lead to an interruption in any of the following hormone pathways: thyroid disorder (secondary hypothyroidism), adrenal gland (adrenal insufficiency due to glucocorticoid deficiency), sex hormone (gonadotropin deficiency), prolactin (a hormone responsible for lactation), growth hormone, or rarely anti-diuretic hormone deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). Since damage to the pituitary can cause a deficiency in more than one of these hormone pathways simultaneously, it is possible to have a mix of any of the signs or symptoms listed below.

Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome&#x27;s most common initial symptoms are difficulties with or total absence of lactation (agalactorrhea). Another common sign is infrequent menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhea) or absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) following delivery. In addition to menstrual irregularities other signs of sex hormone deficiency are hot flashes, decreased libido, and breast involution. Symptoms and signs of thyroid disorder are tiredness, intolerance to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss, slowed thinking, as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. Adrenal gland malfunction can present acutely or chronically. In a more chronic case, it is similar to Addison&#x27;s disease with symptoms including fatigue, weight loss, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels), low hemoglobin levels (anemia) and hyponatremia (low sodium levels) that develop over several months or years. Acute adrenal insufficiency is referred to as an adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening, and occurs very shortly after the inciting event i.e. significant blood loss post-partum in the context of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome. Adrenal crisis signs and symptoms include hypoglycemia, hypotension, weakness, fatigue, and seizures from severe hyponatremia.

Growth hormone deficiency is one of the most common hormone deficiencies of hypopituitarism seen in Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome. Low levels of growth hormone may present with low energy, body aches, or subtle wrinkling of the skin around the eyes or mouth. The symptoms of anti-diuretic hormone deficiency are increased thirst, excessive urination, headache, and fatigue. Hematological changes might be seen as well such as anemia or low platelets (thrombocytopenia). Hyponatremia is seen in many cases of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome because it can result from multiple etiologies. Drops in thyroid hormones and glucocorticoid/adrenal hormones can indirectly lead to hyponatremia through water retention, while blood loss can trigger hyponatremia through ADH secretion. The development of Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone in patients with Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome has been documented in the literature, although the mechanism is not well understood.

==Causes==
As stated, Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome is caused by damage to the pituitary, thereby causing a decrease in one or more of the hormones it normally secretes. Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome typically occurs because of excessive blood loss after delivery (post-partum hemorrhage), although there are several risk factors that may contribute to its development. This syndrome does not appear to be exclusively linked to childbirth, as Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome has been reported in pregnant patients that experienced massive hemorrhage from non-obstetrical causes. The pituitary gland grows and has a higher metabolic demand during pregnancy because the pituitary needs to rev up the production of certain hormones associated with pregnancy. This higher metabolic demand, in turn, leads to higher demand for blood flow.

Thus, if the body enters a state of shock from excessive blood loss in post-partum delivery, the pituitary gland is more susceptible to injury. Although the vast majority of cases of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome occur in the setting of massive blood loss, cases have been documented of acute Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome occurring with blood loss volumes that are not considered &quot;massive&quot;. Some possible predisposing factors to Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome may include: disseminated blood coagulation (DIC), hypotension, small sella turcica size, and blood clots from a pre-existing hypercoagulable disorder. Atony of the uterus is a leading cause of post-partum hemorrhage, therefore uterine atony could induce Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

This syndrome seems to arise when certain factors compound each other to cause pituitary injury. The physiologic enlargement of the pituitary gland in conjunction with an interference in its blood supply, such as episiotomy progressing to anal tearing, ultimately result in pituitary ischemia and necrosis. One cause of pituitary growth associated with the risk of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome is the hyperplasia of lactotrophs which produce prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. Other hormone-secreting cells of the pituitary undergo rapid growth in pregnant women as well, which contribute to the gland&#x27;s enlargement.

The anterior pituitary is supplied by a low pressure portal venous system. The anterior pituitary is more commonly affected in Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome because of the structure of the portal venous system. Posterior pituitary involvement leading to central diabetes insipidus is much rarer, and typically reflects more extensive damage to the organ and more severe disease. It has been suggested that the arrangement of the pituitary&#x27;s blood supply contribute to its susceptibility for injury. &quot;The highly vascularized pituitary tissue involves one of the most rapid blood flow in the human body and probably, therefore, has a tendency to infarction because even small degrees of change in the pituitary intravascular pressure cause an arrest of blood flow&quot;. Ischemia may occur as a result of vasospasm from shock, hypotension, thrombosis, or direct vascular compression of the hypophyseal artery from the enlarged pituitary gland itself. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (i.e., in amniotic fluid embolism or HELLP syndrome) also appears to be a factor in its development.

==Diagnosis==
Typically an important clue that leads to a diagnosis of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome is identifying a deficiency in one or more of the hormones produced directly, or indirectly, by the pituitary gland. The extent of hormone deficiency, and which hormones are affected depends on the extent of the damage to the pituitary. Hormonal assays measure the levels of these hormones which include but are not limited to T4, TSH, estrogen, gonadotropin, cortisol, and ACTH. It might be difficult to detect damage to these hormone pathways if hormone levels are at the borderline of the abnormal range. In this case, stimulation tests will be done to determine if the pituitary is responsive to hypothalamic hormones.

MRI is useful in diagnosing Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome since it examines the structure of the pituitary and may identify any anatomical damage. MRI findings will vary based on how early or late in the disease process the test is being conducted. If an MRI is conducted early enough in the disease process the pituitary may appear larger than normal, and show changes that are consistent with damage from lack of blood supply. Later in the disease process of this syndrome the damage imposed on the pituitary gland will cause it to shrink, and leave a partially empty or totally empty sella turcica on MRI.

==Treatment==
The mainstay of treatment is hormone replacement therapy for the hormones that are missing. Treatment plans and dosages should be individualized by an endocrinologist. Glucocorticoids may be administered to address or prevent an adrenal crisis, a potential serious complication of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome. Hormone replacement is vital in reducing the morbidity and mortality of this syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence of this syndrome is difficult to define because the incidence varies so much from country to country. Sheehan syndrome is more prevalent in developing countries than developed countries. In a study from the United Kingdom in 2001 only 1.4% of patients with hypopituitarism were diagnosed with Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome. Just a few years earlier in 1996 the World Health Organization estimated that 3 million women were effected by Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome. In a study of 1,034 symptomatic adults, Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome was found to be the sixth-most frequent etiology of growth hormone deficiency, being responsible for 3.1% of cases (versus 53.9% due to a pituitary tumor). Additionally, it was found that the majority of women who experienced Sheehan syndrome gave birth at home rather than in a hospital.

==History==

The specific association with postpartum shock or hemorrhage was described in 1937 by the British pathologist Harold Leeming Sheehan (1900–1988). The initial distinction was made in the research article &quot;Post-Partum Necrosis of the Anterior Pituitary&quot;. In his research, Dr. Sheehan reviewed (through autopsy) the effects of pituitary necrosis on 12 cases of patients that experienced postpartum necrosis. He observed cases where lesions and death occurred during or after pregnancy, as well as cases where death occurred in the late stage of necrosis (years later). This started the initial distinction of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome from Simmonds&#x27; disease (also known as hypopituitarism). Sheehan noted that significant feature of these patients&#x27; cases was hemorrhaging, which in his experience was most commonly caused by either: placenta Previa (low placenta), uterine rupture, cervical or uterine tears, post-partum atony, or retained placenta. Simmonds&#x27; disease, however, occurs in either sex due to causes unrelated to pregnancy.

However, in his 1939 publication, &quot;Simmonds&#x27; Disease due to Post-partum Necrosis of the Anterior Pituitary&quot;, Sheehan displays post-partum necrosis as a cause of Simmonds&#x27; disease, thus establishing the relationship between the two conditions. According to Sheehan in 1939 approximately 41% of survivors of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and/or hypovolemic shock experienced severe or partial hypopituitarism.

== Society and culture ==
In the developed world Sheehan&#x27;s Syndrome is a rare complication of pregnancy; although this syndrome is more prevalent in developing countries it continues to effect women around the world. A retrospective study in Turkey found that the prevalence of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome was directly proportional to the amount of at-home deliveries each decade. This may be due to previously limited obstetric techniques present in a home environment. Blood loss associated with episiotomy and forceps exacerbating blood loss when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus, particularly in mothers with low blood pressure, even in obstetric setting, namely hospital, caused a more subtle Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome of Growth Hormone, Anti-Duretic Hormone, ACTH deficiency, which may be life threatening if missed; PubMed.gov Sheehan&#x27;s in modern times:a nationwide retrospective study Iceland 2011, where every mother gives birth in hospital, with full obstetric care available.

== Research ==
At present, the part that autoimmunity plays in the development of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome is uncertain. Several case reports have identified anti-pituitary antibodies in patients diagnosed with Sheehan&#x27;s. Some patients also tested positive for anti-hypothalamus antibodies. Given that many patients that have developed Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome do not have detectable levels of these antibodies, it is unclear whether these antibodies cause this syndrome or result from it.

<doc id="862687" wikidata="Q6503514" url="?curid=862687" title="Law of total tricks">
<text>In contract bridge, the Law of total tricks (abbreviated here as LoTT) is a guideline used to help determine how high to bid in a competitive auction. It is not really a law (because counterexamples are easy to find) but a method of hand evaluation which describes a relationship that seems to exist somewhat regularly. Written by Jean-René Vernes for French players in the 1950s as a rule of thumb, it was first described in English in 1966 International Bridge Academy Annals. It received more notice from appearing in The Bridge World in June 1969. In 1981 Dick Payne and Joe Amsbury, using their abbreviation TNT (Total Number of Tricks), wrote at length about it for British readers. Later, in the US, Marty Bergen and Larry Cohen popularized the approach, using their preferred abbreviation: &#x27;the LAW&#x27; (all capitals).

It was prefigured in S. J. &quot;Skid&quot; Simon&#x27;s 1945 book &quot;Why You Lose at Bridge&quot; in his aphorism &quot;When in doubt, bid one more&quot;.

==Definition==
LoTT can be stated as follows:

&quot;The total number of tricks available on a deal is equal to the total number of trump cards both sides hold in their respective best suits, where the total number of tricks is defined as the sum of the number of tricks available to each side if they could choose trumps.&quot;

As an example, if North-South between them hold nine spades and East-West hold eight clubs, the LoTT says that the total number of tricks available is 17 (9 + 8). Note the LoTT says nothing about how many tricks each side will make; this depends on the split of high card points (HCP) as well as the number of trumps held - if, in the example, the side with eight clubs held all the HCP, they would make all 13 tricks with clubs as trumps - but if the other side could choose spades as trumps, they could well make four tricks (draw trumps and cross ruff) - note 13 + 4 still = 17. When the HCP are fairly evenly split between the two sides, the number of trumps held by each side is a close indicator of the tricks available to each side.

This method works on the assumption that for shapely hands, the combined length of the trump suit is more significant than points or HCP in deciding on the level of the final contract. It is of most value in competitive bidding situations where the HCP are divided roughly equally between the partnerships.

LoTT is said to be most accurate when the HCP are fairly evenly divided between the two sides and the bidding is competitive. Experts apply adjustment factors to improve accuracy.

==TNT (Total Number of Trumps = Total Number of Tricks)==
Payne and Amsbury&#x27;s &quot;Bridge: TNT and Competitive Bidding&quot; (1981) may have been the first major book on the topic. In the introduction, the authors acknowledge Jean-René Vernes as the first writer to investigate TNT (Total Number of Tricks) Theory. Page 19 includes a key table that may not have been printed elsewhere.

==Total trumps principle==
By combining LoTT with the scoring table, it is argued that the following &quot;Total trumps principle&quot; is quite often a winning strategy:

:&quot;Bid to a number of tricks equal to the number of trumps you and your partner hold (and no higher) in a competitive auction.&quot;

Thus, if with an eight-card fit, a pair is safe to bid to the two level but are unsafe to go to the three level. But, with a nine-card fit, the three level will be safe.

In this context, &quot;safe&quot; does not necessarily mean that the contract will be made. But if not, it means that it is a worthwhile sacrifice against the opponents&#x27; contract. For example, if the opponents have bid to two spades, and you have a nine-card heart fit, the &quot;law&quot; says you should bid three hearts. Assuming the opponents have an eight-card spade fit, there are 17 total tricks. If the opponents can take eight tricks, LoTT says you can take nine. If the opponents can take nine tricks, LoTT says you can take only eight. But down one (even doubled, if not vulnerable) is a smaller negative score for you than letting the opponents make three.

Derived from LoTT, this principle assists players in judging the level to which they should bid in a competitive situation. At its simplest a player should bid to the level of their calculation (from the bidding) of the number of trumps held by their side:
* When the balance of HCP is unfavourable, bidding to this level will act as a useful sacrifice
* When the balance of HCP is favourable, bidding to this level will be an achievable contract
* When the HCP are fairly equally split between the two sides, bidding to this level avoids the danger of a misplaced sacrifice

In certain competitive situations, vulnerability can influence the optimum contract. Thus, with the HCP evenly split and facing a bid at the three level by the opposition, bidding to a level above the number of trumps held can be a useful sacrifice at favourable vulnerability.

==Examples==
For example, suppose that North-South have an eight-card heart fit and East-West have an eight-card spade fit. The total number of trumps is 16 so the &quot;law&quot; says the total number of tricks is also 16. That is, if North-South can take eight tricks playing in hearts, then East-West can take 16 - 8 = 8 tricks playing in spades; if North-South can take nine tricks in hearts, LoTT says East-West can take only seven tricks in spades.

 In the diagram, N-S have 9 spades and E-W 8 hearts combined. N-S can make 4 spades (conceding two clubs and heart ace) while E-W can make only 1 heart on a good defense (which takes a trump from QJ, two spades, diamond ace and two diamond ruffs)—the law holds, as the total tricks available is 10+7=17.

Note, however, how minor card rearrangements affect the law:


===Consequences===
There are a number of bridge conventions that take advantage of this principle. For example, Bergen raises following an opening bid of one of a major (using a 5-card major system):

* 3 of the major = 4-card support and 0-6 HCP
* 3C = 4-card support and 7-9 points
* 3D = 4-card support and 10-12 HCP

In 2002, Anders Wirgren called the accuracy of the &quot;law&quot; into question, saying it works on only 35-40% of deals. However, Larry Cohen remains convinced it is a useful guideline, especially when adjustments are used properly. Mendelson (1998) finds that it is &quot;accurate to within one trick on the vast majority of hands&quot;

<text>Cirebon (, formerly rendered Cheribon or Chirebon in English) is a port city on the northern coast of the Indonesian island of Java. It is the only coastal city of West Java, located about 40 km west of the provincial border with Central Java, approximately east of Jakarta, at . It had a population of 296,389 at the 2010 census and 333,303 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 341,980 (comprising 171,638 males and 170,342 females).

The built-up area of Cirebon reaches out from the city and into the surrounding regency of the same name; the official metropolitan area encompasses the whole of this regency as well as the city, and covers an area of , with a 2010 census population of 2,363,585; the 2020 census total was 2,603,924 and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,702,421.

Straddling the border between West and Central Java, Cirebon&#x27;s history has been influenced by both Sundanese and Javanese culture as well as Arab and Chinese, and is the seat of a former Sultanate.

== Etymology ==
Being on the border of Sundanese (i.e., Western Java) and Javanese (i.e., Central Java) cultural regions, many of Cirebon&#x27;s residents speak a dialect that is a mix of Sundanese and Javanese, known as &quot;Jawareh&quot;. It is thought that the word &quot;Cirebon&quot; derives from the Javanese word, &quot;caruban&quot;, meaning &quot;mixed&quot;: a reference to the city&#x27;s mix of Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic cultural elements. Alternatively, it could be derived from the Sundanese words &quot;ci&quot; (water or river) and &quot;rebon&quot; (&quot;shrimp&quot;). (Indeed, the main product of the city is fish including shrimp.)

== History ==
The sultanate court lies near the modern-day city of Cirebon on West Java&#x27;s northern coast. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the sultanate thrived and became an important center in the region for trade, commerce, and Islamic study and dissemination in Java. In 1677, the sultanate split into four royal houses, leaving four kratons (palaces) in Cirebon; Keraton Kasepuhan, Kraton Kanoman, Keraton Kacirebonan, and Keraton Keprabonan. Each has its own lineage and all are the descendants and stewards of the original Cirebon Sultanate.

According to the manuscript &quot;Purwaka Caruban Nagari&quot;, Cirebon started as a small fishing village in the 15th century named Muara Jati which attracted foreign traders. The port master at that time was Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang, appointed by the king of Galuh kingdom, located inland in Kawali, Ciamis. He later moved the port to Lemahwungkuk, to the south. As the new settlement leader, Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang was bestowed with the title &quot;Kuwu Cerbon&quot; (Cerbon village leader).

A 15th-century prince from Pajajaran, Prince Walangsungsang, converted to Islam and was appointed as the &quot;Adipati&quot; (Duke) of Cirebon with the title &quot;Cakrabumi&quot;. He established the new kingdom of Cirebon and declared independence from Sunda and Galuh. The establishment of the Cirebon Sultanate marked the first Islamic rule in western Java, transforming Muara Jati into a busy port. Cirebon was an independent sultanate under the leadership of Sunan Gunungjati in the early 16th century. After the Sunda Kingdom collapsed, the Sultanates of Banten and Mataram fought over control of Cirebon, which declared its allegiance to Sultan Agung of Mataram, whose grandson Amangkurat II ceded the city to the Dutch in 1677. In 1705, a treaty saw the Cirebon area west of Cisanggarung River become a Dutch protectorate jointly administered by three sultans whose courts rivalled those of Central Java. The Dutch authorities later established the Cirebon Residency (&quot;Residentie Tjirebon&quot;) which was composed of present-day Cirebon, Indramayu, and Kuningan.
During the time of the Dutch &quot;Culture System&quot; a flourishing trade in colonial cash crops attracted many Chinese entrepreneurs and that influence is still evident in the batik for which Cirebon is famous. Cirebon suffered a famine in 1844, apparently triggered by a combination of drought and the shift from subsistence agriculture to cash crops, particularly indigo and sugarcane, enforced by Dutch&#x27;s Cultivation system.

== Geography ==

===Climate===
Cirebon has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with moderate to little rainfall from June to October and heavy to very heavy rainfall from November to May.
=== Administrative divisions ===
The city of Cirebon is divided into five administrative districts (kecamatan), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2011 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres and the number of administrative villages in each district (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;).
The five districts are sub-divided into twenty-two urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) which are listed below with their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census.

== Demographics ==
The city&#x27;s population was 298,224 at the Indonesia census of 2010. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 341,980. As with other coastal cities in Indonesia, a large population of ethnic Chinese has flocked into the city as a result of long-term Chinese immigration since the 17th century. Other communities include Malays, Koreans, Arabs, Indians, Japanese. Significant suburbs lie within densely populated Cirebon Regency, and the official metropolitan area encompasses this entire regency as well as the city.

Although surrounded by Sundanese-speaking areas in West Java, linguists have stated that Cirebon (and the historically related region of Serang city in Banten Province) are inside its own Cirebonese language area. In addition, this is supported by a large portion of the Cirebon people referring to themselves as &quot;Wong Cirebon&quot; (&quot;Cirebonese people&quot;), and to their language as &quot;Basa Cirebon&quot; (&quot;Cirebonese&quot;). Cirebonese language is related to Javanese and Banyumasan with dialects such as the &quot;Jawareh&quot; (half-Javanese half Sundanese), &quot;Plered&quot;, and &quot;Dermayon&quot;. There are also native Sundanese speakers in the city, who speak a local dialect known as &quot;Bahasa Sunda Cirebon&quot; (Cirebonese Sundanese language) which contains unique words not found in its Priangan counterpart.

==Campaign for Cirebon Province==
In the modern era, some of the local political elite in Cirebon and surrounding regencies have campaigned for Cirebon city, together with the regencies of Cirebon, Indramayu, Kuningan and Majalengka to be established as a new province - in the same way as Banten Province was formed by splitting it away from West Java. To be a new province it is required that it should be proposed by at least five regencies. Leaders from four of these administrations have given their consent, but Majalengka Regency has turned down the idea and indicated that it would prefer to stay part of West Java. However, the lack of support from the Majalengka area does not preclude Cirebon city and the other three regencies from continuing to promote the idea.

The potential size and population of this possible Province would be as follows:

== Economy ==
Cirebon City&#x27;s economy is influenced by its strategic geographical location and by the characteristics of natural resources. Thus, the structure of its economy is dominated by manufacturing, trade, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications, and service sectors. Tomé Pires in the Suma Oriental around the year 1513 mentioned Cirebon was one of the trade centers on the island of Java. After Cirebon was taken over by the Dutch East Indies government in 1859, it was designated as a transit port for import-export goods and as a communications route to the political control center for the region in the interior of Java.

Until 2001, the economic contribution to the City of Cirebon was characterized by processing industry (41.32%),
followed by trade, hotels and restaurants (29.8%), transport and communications sector (13.56%), and services sector (6.06%). Other sectors (9.26%) included mining, agriculture, construction, electricity, and gas. Aside from fishery, its harbor, Tanjung Emas, on the Java Sea has been a major hub for timber from Borneo.

==Culture==
Cirebon itself is known as &quot;Grage&quot; in the Cirebon dialect of Javanese language, which came from the words &quot;Negara Gede&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Kingdom.&quot; As a port city, Cirebon attracts visitors and settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia and from other nations as well. Cirebon culture was described as Java &quot;Pasisiran&quot; (coastal) culture, similar to the cultures of Banten, Pekalongan, and Semarang, with notable mixtures of Sundanese, Chinese, Arabic-Islamic, and European influences.

=== Arts and crafts ===

Batik textiles from Cirebon, especially Cirebon batik with vivid colors with motifs and patterns, that demonstrate Chinese and local influences, are well known. Chinese influences can be seen in Cirebon&#x27;s culture, most notably the Cirebon batik &quot;Megamendung&quot; pattern that resembles Chinese cloud imagery. The Trusmi area is the production center of Cirebon batik. Cirebon Glass Painting is another aspect of Cirebon arts and crafts. The imagery in glass painting is usually derived from wayang theme to Islamic calligraphy.

=== Performing arts ===

The Tari Topeng Cirebon, or Cirebon mask dance, is a dance style peculiar to the city. Topeng Cirebon mask dance, inspired by Javanese Panji cycles is one of notable Cirebon traditional dance and quite famous within Indonesian dances.

Cirebon culture is also influenced by Islamic Middle Eastern culture, such as the &quot;Burokan&quot; tradition where people exhibit the image of buraq — traditionally made from the bamboo frame and paper skin, or other materials — in processions around the village accompanied with music. The traditions of the bamboo statues borne in these processions are similar to Sundanese &quot;Sisingaan&quot;, Betawi &quot;Ondel-ondel&quot;, or Balinese &quot;Ogoh-ogoh&quot; processions, yet differ in their Islamic theme. &quot;Burokan&quot; are usually held during festive occasions such as circumcision or marriage, and are accompanied by popular Cirebon folk songs, such as &quot;tarling.&quot;

Tarling is a musical tradition reminiscent of Bandung&#x27;s &quot;kecapi suling&quot; music with except that it features guitar, &quot;suling&quot; (bamboo flute) and voice. The name derived from &quot;gitar (guitar), and &quot;suling (flute).

===Sports===
Cirebon is the home town of the PSGJ Cirebon football team, the club plays in the Liga Nusantara.
Another team, Cirebon Football Club, team also plays in the Liga Nusantara is based in the Bima stadium Cirebon. Other popular sports in Cirebon include Futsal.

=== Court culture ===
The remnants of Cirebon sultanate; Kasepuhan, Kanoman, Kaprabonan, and Kacirebonan kratons are now run as cultural institutions to preserve Cirebon culture. Each still holds their traditional ceremonies and have become the patrons of Cirebon arts. Some of the royal symbols of the Cirebon Sultanate describe their legacy and influences. The banner of Cirebon Sultanate is called &quot;Macan Ali&quot; (Ali&#x27;s panther) with Arabic calligraphy arranged to resemble a panther or tiger. These indicate both Islamic influence and that of the Hindu Pajajaran Sundanese King Siliwangi&#x27;s tiger banner. The royal lineage of Cirebon is still well respected and is held in high prestige among the people of Cirebon, although it does not hold real political power anymore.

The royal carriage of Kasepuhan&#x27;s Singa Barong and Kanoman&#x27;s Paksi Naga Liman carriage resembles the chimera of three animals; eagle, elephant, and dragon. These symbolize Indian Hinduism, Arabic Islam, and Chinese influences. The images of Macan Ali, Singa Barong, and Paksi Naga Liman are also often featured as patterns in Cirebon batik.

=== Cuisine ===
As a coastal city, Cirebon&#x27;s main industry is fishery. Its products include &quot;terasi&quot; (shrimp paste), &quot;petis&quot;, &quot;krupuk udang&quot; (shrimp crackers) and various salted fish.

<text>The Debian Social Contract (DSC) is a document that frames the moral agenda of the Debian project. The values outlined in the Social Contract provide the basic principles for the Debian Free Software Guidelines that serve as the basis of the Open Source Definition.

Debian believes the makers of a free software operating system should provide guarantees when a user entrusts them with control of a computer. These guarantees include:
*Ensuring that the operating system remains open and free.
*Giving improvements back to the community that made the operating system possible.
*Not hiding problems with the software or organization.
*Staying focused on the users and the software that started the phenomenon.
*Making it possible for the software to be used with non-free software.

==History==
The idea of the DSC was first proposed by Ean Schuessler after a conversation with Bob Young, co-founder of Red Hat. Schuessler said Red Hat should issue a set of guidelines that would guarantee to the community as the company expanded it would always be committed to the ideals of Free Software. Young said this would be a &quot;kiss of death&quot; for Red Hat, implying it would constrain the company&#x27;s ability to generate profit. Concerned about Young&#x27;s response, Schuessler and other Debian developers decided to broach the idea of a &quot;social contract&quot; that would supplement Debian&#x27;s initial manifesto written by Ian Murdock. Bruce Perens later led the effort from June 1997 to coordinate the creation of the DSC using the Free Software Definition as its basis.

The Debian project ratified its social contract 1.0 on July 5, 1997.

<text>A photometer is an instrument that measures the strength of electromagnetic radiation in the range from ultraviolet to infrared and including the visible spectrum. Most photometers convert light into an electric current using a photoresistor, photodiode, or photomultiplier.

Photometers measure:
*Illuminance
*Irradiance
*Light absorption 
*Scattering of light
*Reflection of light
*Fluorescence
*Phosphorescence
*Luminescence

Historically, photometry was done by estimation, comparing the luminous flux of a source with a standard source. By the 19th century, common photometers included Rumford&#x27;s photometer, which compared the depths of shadows cast by different light sources, and Ritchie&#x27;s photometer, which relied on equal illumination of surfaces. Another type was based on the extinction of shadows.

Modern photometers utilize photoresistors, photodiodes or photomultipliers to detect light. Some models employ photon counting, measuring light by counting individual photons. They are especially useful in areas where the irradiance is low. Photometers have wide-ranging applications including photography, where they determine the correct exposure, and science, where they are used in absorption spectroscopy to calculate the concentration of substances in a solution, infrared spectroscopy to study the structure of substances, and atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the concentration of metals in a solution.

==History==
Before electronic light sensitive elements were developed, photometry was done by estimation by the eye. The relative luminous flux of a source was compared with a standard source. The photometer is placed such that the illuminance from the source being investigated is equal to the standard source, as the human eye can judge equal illuminance. The relative luminous fluxes can then be calculated as the illuminance decreases proportionally to the inverse square of distance. A standard example of such a photometer consists of a piece of paper with an oil spot on it that makes the paper slightly more transparent. When the spot is not visible from either side, the illuminance from the two sides is equal.

By 1861, three types were in common use. These were Rumford&#x27;s photometer, Ritchie&#x27;s photometer, and photometers that used the extinction of shadows, which was considered to be the most precise.

===Rumford&#x27;s photometer===

Rumford&#x27;s photometer (also called a shadow photometer) depended on the principle that a brighter light would cast a deeper shadow. The two lights to be compared were used to cast a shadow onto paper. If the shadows were of the same depth, the difference in distance of the lights would indicate the difference in intensity (e.g. a light twice as far would be four times the intensity).

===Ritchie&#x27;s photometer===

Ritchie&#x27;s photometer depends upon equal illumination of surfaces. It consists of a box (a,b) six or eight inches long, and one in width and depth. In the middle, a wedge of wood (f,e,g) was angled upwards and covered with white paper. The user&#x27;s eye looked through a tube (d) at the top of a box. The height of the apparatus was also adjustable via the stand (c). The lights to compare were placed at the side of the box (m, n)—which illuminated the paper surfaces so that the eye saw both surfaces at once. By changing the position of the lights, they were made to illuminate both surfaces equally, with the difference in intensity corresponding to the square of the difference in distance.

===Method of extinction of shadows===
This type of photometer depended on the fact that if a light throws the shadow of an opaque object onto a white screen, there is a certain distance that, if a second light is brought there, obliterates all traces of the shadow.

==Principle of photometers==
Most photometers detect the light with photoresistors, photodiodes or photomultipliers. To analyze the light, the photometer may measure the light after it has passed through a filter or through a monochromator for determination at defined wavelengths or for analysis of the spectral distribution of the light.

==Photon counting==

Some photometers measure light by counting individual photons rather than incoming flux. The operating principles are the same but the results are given in units such as photons/cm2 or photons·cm−2·sr−1 rather than W/cm2 or W·cm−2·sr−1.

Due to their individual photon counting nature, these instruments are limited to observations where the irradiance is low. The irradiance is limited by the time resolution of its associated detector readout electronics. With current technology this is in the megahertz range. The maximum irradiance is also limited by the throughput and gain parameters of the detector itself.

The light sensing element in photon counting devices in NIR, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths is a photomultiplier to achieve sufficient sensitivity.

In airborne and space-based remote sensing such photon counters are used at the upper reaches of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the X-ray to far ultraviolet. This is usually due to the lower radiant intensity of the objects being measured as well as the difficulty of measuring light at higher energies using its particle-like nature as compared to the wavelike nature of light at lower frequencies. Conversely, radiometers are typically used for remote sensing from the visible, infrared though radio frequency range.

==Photography==

Photometers are used to determine the correct exposure in photography. In modern cameras, the photometer is usually built in. As the illumination of different parts of the picture varies, advanced photometers measure the light intensity in different parts of the potential picture and use an algorithm to determine the most suitable exposure for the final picture, adapting the algorithm to the type of picture intended (see Metering mode). Historically, a photometer was separate from the camera and known as an exposure meter. The advanced photometers then could be used either to measure the light from the potential picture as a whole, to measure from elements of the picture to ascertain that the most important parts of the picture are optimally exposed, or to measure the incident light to the scene with an integrating adapter.

==Visible light reflectance photometry==
A reflectance photometer measures the reflectance of a surface as a function of wavelength. The surface is illuminated with white light, and the reflected light is measured after passing through a monochromator. This type of measurement has mainly practical applications, for instance in the paint industry to characterize the colour of a surface objectively.

==UV and visible light transmission photometry==

These are optical instruments for measurement of the absorption of light of a given wavelength (or a given range of wavelengths) of coloured substances in solution. From the light absorption, Beer&#x27;s law makes it possible to calculate the concentration of the coloured substance in the solution. Due to its wide range of application and its reliability and robustness, the photometer has become one of the principal instruments in biochemistry and analytical chemistry. Absorption photometers for work in aqueous solution work in the ultraviolet and visible ranges, from wavelength around 240 nm up to 750 nm.

The principle of spectrophotometers and filter photometers is that (as far as possible) monochromatic light is allowed to pass through a container (cell) with optically flat windows containing the solution. It then reaches a light detector, that measures the intensity of the light compared to the intensity after passing through an identical cell with the same solvent but without the coloured substance. From the ratio between the light intensities, knowing the capacity of the coloured substance to absorb light (the absorbency of the coloured substance, or the photon cross section area of the molecules of the coloured substance at a given wavelength), it is possible to calculate the concentration of the substance using Beer&#x27;s law.

Two types of photometers are used: spectrophotometer and filter photometer. In spectrophotometers a monochromator (with prism or with grating) is used to obtain monochromatic light of one defined wavelength. In filter photometers, optical filters are used to give the monochromatic light. Spectrophotometers can thus easily be set to measure the absorbance at different wavelengths, and they can also be used to scan the spectrum of the absorbing substance. They are in this way more flexible than filter photometers, also give a higher optical purity of the analyzing light, and therefore they are preferably used for research purposes. Filter photometers are cheaper, robuster and easier to use and therefore they are used for routine analysis. Photometers for microtiter plates are filter photometers.

==Infrared light transmission photometry==

Spectrophotometry in infrared light is mainly used to study structure of substances, as given groups give absorption at defined wavelengths. Measurement in aqueous solution is generally not possible, as water absorbs infrared light strongly in some wavelength ranges. Therefore, infrared spectroscopy is either performed in the gaseous phase (for volatile substances) or with the substances pressed into tablets together with salts that are transparent in the infrared range. Potassium bromide (KBr) is commonly used for this purpose. The substance being tested is thoroughly mixed with specially purified KBr and pressed into a transparent tablet, that is placed in the beam of light. The analysis of the wavelength dependence is generally not done using a monochromator as it is in UV-Vis, but with the use of an interferometer. The interference pattern can be analyzed using a Fourier transform algorithm. In this way, the whole wavelength range can be analyzed simultaneously, saving time, and an interferometer is also less expensive than a monochromator. The light absorbed in the infrared region does not correspond to electronic excitation of the substance studied, but rather to different kinds of vibrational excitation. The vibrational excitations are characteristic of different groups in a molecule, that can in this way be identified. The infrared spectrum typically has very narrow absorption lines, which makes them unsuited for quantitative analysis but gives very detailed information about the molecules. The frequencies of the different modes of vibration varies with isotope, and therefore different isotopes give different peaks. This makes it possible also to study the isotopic composition of a sample with infrared spectrophotometry.

==Atomic absorption photometry==

Atomic absorption photometers are photometers that measure the light from a very hot flame. The solution to be analyzed is injected into the flame at a constant, known rate. Metals in the solution are present in atomic form in the flame. The monochromatic light in this type of photometer is generated by a discharge lamp where the discharge takes place in a gas with the metal to be determined. The discharge then emits light with wavelengths corresponding to the spectral lines of the metal. A filter may be used to isolate one of the main spectral lines of the metal to be analyzed. The light is absorbed by the metal in the flame, and the absorption is used to determine the concentration of the metal in the original solution.

<doc id="862696" wikidata="Q6863569" url="?curid=862696" title="Mind over matter">
<text>&quot;Mind over matter&quot; is a phrase that has been used in several contexts, such as mind-centric spiritual doctrines, parapsychology, and philosophy.

Merriam Webster Dictionary defines mind as &quot;the element or complex of elements in an individual that feels, perceives, thinks, wills, and especially reasons&quot; and mind over matter as able to; &quot;a situation in which someone is able to control a physical condition, problem, etc., by using the mind&quot;.

==Origin==
The phrase &quot;mind over matter&quot; first appeared in 1863 in &quot;The Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of Man&quot; by Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) and was first used to refer to the increasing status and evolutionary growth of the minds of animals and man throughout Earth history. 

Another related saying, &quot;the mind drives the mass&quot; (Latin: ), was coined almost two millennia earlier, in 19 B.C. by the poet Virgil in his work &quot;Aeneid&quot;, book 6, line 727.

==Parapsychology==
In the field of parapsychology, the phrase has been used to describe paranormal phenomena such as psychokinesis.

==Mao Zedong==
&quot;Mind over matter&quot; was also Mao Zedong&#x27;s idea that rural peasants could be &quot;proletarianized&quot; so they could lead the revolution and China could move from feudalism to socialism through New Democracy. According to some, it departs from Leninism in that the revolutionaries are peasants, instead of the urban proletariat.

==Controlling pain==
The phrase also relates to the ability to control the perception of pain that one may or may not be experiencing.

<text>Sir John Hall (21 September 1911 — 19 January 1978) was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Education and business career==
Hall was educated privately and worked as a chartered secretary and company director, including of Viskase and Bass Charrington. 

==Political career==
Hall first stood for Parliament without success in Grimsby in 1950 and Fulham East in 1951. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Wycombe at a by-election in November 1952. Hall served as an opposition spokesman on Treasury, economic affairs and trade until October 1965. He was an executive member of the 1922 Committee from 1964 to 1966 and vice-chairman of the Conservative parliamentary finance committee from 1965.

He was knighted in July 1973 &quot;for political and public services&quot;.

Hall suffered a heart attack in the summer of 1977 and soon announced he would not stand for election again. He died at a hospital in London on 19 January 1978, aged 66. His death triggered the by-election.

==Personal life==
In 1935, Hall married Nancy Doreen Hampton Blake. They had a son and a daughter. The Halls lived at Carlisle Place, London SW1.

<text>Sydenham Teast Edwards (5 August 1768 – 8 February 1819) was a natural history illustrator. He illustrated plants, birds and importantly published an illustrated book on the breeds of dogs in Britain, &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot;.

Edwards was born in 1768 in Usk, Monmouthshire, the son of Lloyd Pittell Edwards, a schoolmaster and organist; and his wife, Mary Reese, who had been married on 26 September 1765, at Llantilio Crossenny Church, and where Sydenham was christened in 1768. Mary Reese was a sister of the Rev. William Reece, the curate of Llantilio Crossenny who had married Ann Mackafee. Their son, Richard Reece was an eminent physician and wrote a number of works on medicine. Young Edwards had a precocious talent for draughtsmanship and when only 11 years old had copied plates from &quot;Flora Londinensis&quot; for his own enjoyment. A certain Mr. Denman visited Abergavenny in 1779 and saw some of Edwards&#x27; work. Denman, being a friend of William Curtis, the publisher of botanical works, and founder of the &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot;, spoke to Curtis about the boy. Curtis proceeded to have Edwards trained in both botany and botanical illustration.

Edwards produced plates at a prodigious rate: between 1787 and 1815 he produced over 1,700 watercolours for the &quot;Botanical Magazine&quot; alone. He illustrated &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot; (1800) (an encyclopaedic compendium of dog breeds in Britain), &quot;New Botanic Garden&quot; (1805-7), &quot;New Flora Britannica&quot; (1812), and &quot;The Botanical Register&quot; (1815-19). Edwards established the latter under his own editorship in 1815 after a disagreement with John Sims, who succeeded Curtis as editor. He also provided drawings for encyclopedias such as &quot;Pantologia&quot; and &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot;. He completed a number of parrot illustrations between 1810 and 1812 which were acquired by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby. Edwards was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1804.

Edwards&#x27; work inspired the decoration of ceramics made by a number of major potters of the time, such as Spode.

He was buried at Chelsea Old Church (All Saints), London.

There is confusion over the spelling of his middle name. He was baptised Sydenham Edwards, but by the 1790s adopted the middle name &#x27;Teak&#x27; on some signatures of his drawings. His death certificate has this as &#x27;Teaste&#x27;, whereas his tombstone, in Chelsea Old Church, it was &#x27;Teast&#x27;. A memorial in the church reads, &quot;As a faithful delineator of nature, few equalled, none excelled.&quot; The tombstone was destroyed by bombings in World War II, but has been replaced.

<doc id="862713" wikidata="Q231001" url="?curid=862713" title="Amanda Beard">
<text>Amanda Ray Beard (born October 29, 1981), also known by her married name Amanda Brown, is an American swimmer and a seven-time Olympic medalist (two gold, four silver, one bronze). She is a former world record holder in the 200-meter breaststroke (long course).

Beard&#x27;s success has earned her the American Swimmer of the Year Award twice. She has won a total of twenty-one medals in major international competition, five gold, thirteen silver, and three bronze spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, the Pan Pacific Championships, and the Summer Universiade.

==Career==

===1996 Summer Olympics===
At the age of 14, Beard made her inaugural Olympic appearance at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, when a student at Irvine High School in Irvine, California. She was often photographed clutching her teddy bear, even on the medal stand. Beard has the distinction of being the second-youngest American Olympic medalist when she won three medals—a gold and two silvers.

===2000–2003===
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Beard won a bronze medal in the 200-meter breaststroke.

Beard attended the University of Arizona, where she competed for the Arizona Wildcats swimming and diving team. She won an individual NCAA Division I championship in 2001. In 2003, she became the world champion and American record-holder in the 200-meter breaststroke.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Swim Trials, she qualified to participate in four events at the 2004 Summer Olympics and broke the world record in the 200-meter breaststroke. She would win a gold medal in the 200-meter breaststroke. Beard also won silver in both the 200-meter individual medley and the 4×100-meter medley relay. Her split in the medley relay was the fastest out of the eight competing (1:06.32).

===2008 Summer Olympics===
At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Swim Trials, Beard finished second in the 200-meter breaststroke event, and she qualified for her fourth consecutive Olympics. On July 30, 2008, at the U.S. swimming team&#x27;s final training in Singapore, Beard, together with Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin, were elected co-captains of the U.S. Olympic women&#x27;s swimming team.

In Beijing, Beard failed to reach the semi-finals in the 200-meter breaststroke, placing 18th in the preliminaries.

===2010 U.S. Swimming Nationals===
In August 2010, she came out of retirement to compete at the 2010 Conoco Phillips National Championships. She finished second in the 200-meter breaststroke finals at 2:26.50, qualifying her for the Pan Pac team to represent the United States later in the month.

In the 100-meter breaststroke, Amanda Beard swam a 1:08.72 in prelims and 1:09.12 in finals, finishing 6th.

After the U.S. Nationals, Beard and Natalie Coughlin were nominated co-captains of U.S. national team once again. During the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Amanda Beard signed up for her two signature events, the 100- and the 200-meter breaststroke.
Beard qualified for finals in both events, but failed to medal. She was fifth in the 100-meter breaststroke (1:07.49) and fifth in the 200-meter breaststroke (2:24.30).

===2012 Summer Olympics===
Beard failed to qualify for the 2012 Olympic team after finishing 5th in the 200-meter breaststroke at the Olympic swimming trials.

===Modeling and advertising===

Her modeling work has included appearances in &quot;FHM&quot;, the 2006 &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition&quot;, and the July 2007 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, in which she posed nude.

She is a spokeswoman for Defenders of Wildlife, and enjoys interior decorating. Both of her sisters, Leah and Taryn, are swimmers. Amanda placed eighth in the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach Celebrity car race in 2006.

In November 2007, Beard made her first television commercial for GoDaddy entitled &quot;Shock&quot;. It featured her &quot;flashing&quot; the seven Olympic medals she won from 1996 to 2004. Mark Spitz made a cameo appearance.

In April 2008, she joined Fox Network&#x27;s popular sports talk program, &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; as a correspondent, covering major sporting events.

In 2008, Beard participated in an anti-fur campaign for the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). She was photographed semi-nude (again covering her breasts and not exposing her nipples) in front of an American flag. The flag in that photograph is hung incorrectly according to the United States Flag Code with the blue field (canton) to the upper right. Shortly after the PETA campaign was released, accusations of hypocrisy surfaced. Beard had told a fashion blogger the year before that her favorite shoes were leather sandals, and she had stated during an interview with &quot;SmartMoney&quot; magazine that she would never buy a low-quality leather jacket.

==Personal life==
Beard is a vegetarian. She reports a case of mild dyslexia, which caused trouble with grades in school. She is married to photographer Sacha Brown. On September 15, 2009, she gave birth to their first child, a boy named Blaise Ray Brown. Their daughter, Doone Isla Brown, was born on June 19, 2013.

==Body dysmorphia==
After achieving an athletic scholarship to the University of Arizona, Beard began to struggle with body dysmorphic disorder. Stress from wearing a swimsuit in front of others as well as seeing the photo-shopping process of her ads caused Beard to desire having a body which matched that in her photos. Beard has said that &quot;even if it had hurt my swimming, I wouldn&#x27;t have stopped. I wanted to be a great swimmer, but more than that, I wanted to be pretty, skinny, and perfect.&quot;

==Autobiography==
Beard released an autobiography on April 3, 2012, entitled &quot;In the Water They Can&#x27;t See You Cry: A Memoir&quot;. She explains the title&#x27;s significance as the sensation of putting her face in the water while swimming to hide any tears she shed into her goggles. The book cites her parents&#x27; divorce at the age of 12 as the beginning of her personal struggles, as well as her perfectionist nature. In the memoir, Beard chronicles struggles with self-mutilation, depression and drug use. She credits her husband with encouraging her to seek therapy.

== Personal bests==
Beard&#x27;s personal bests in long-course meters are:
* 100 m breaststroke: 1:07.42, 2003 World Aquatics Championships
* 200 m breaststroke: 2:22.44, 2004 U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials 2004
* 200 m individual medley: 2:11.70, 2004 Summer Olympics

<doc id="862717" wikidata="Q10281355" url="?curid=862717" title="Projectile motion">
<text>Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is projected in a gravitational field, such as from Earth&#x27;s surface, and moves along a curved path (a trajectory) under the action of gravity only. In the particular case of projectile motion on Earth, most calculations assume the effects of air resistance are negligible.

Galileo Galilei showed that the trajectory of a given projectile is parabolic, but the path may also be straight in the special case when the object is thrown directly upward or downward. The study of such motions is called ballistics, and such a trajectory is described as ballistic. The only force of mathematical significance that is actively exerted on the object is gravity, which acts downward, thus imparting to the object a downward acceleration towards Earth&#x27;s center of mass. Due to the object&#x27;s inertia, no external force is needed to maintain the horizontal velocity component of the object&#x27;s motion.

Taking other forces into account, such as aerodynamic drag or internal propulsion (such as in a rocket), requires additional analysis. A ballistic missile is a missile only guided during the relatively brief initial powered phase of flight, and whose remaining course is governed by the laws of classical mechanics.

Ballistics () is the science of dynamics that deals with the flight, behavior and effects of projectiles, especially bullets, unguided bombs, rockets, or the like; the science or art of designing and accelerating projectiles so as to achieve a desired performance.

The elementary equations of ballistics neglect nearly every factor except for initial velocity, the launch angle and a gravitational acceleration assumed constant. Practical solutions of a ballistics problem often require considerations of air resistance, cross winds, target motion, acceleration due to gravity varying with height, and in such problems as launching a rocket from one point on the Earth to another, the horizon&#x27;s distance &quot;vs&quot; curvature R of the Earth (its local speed of rotation formula_1). Detailed mathematical solutions of practical problems typically do not have closed-form solutions, and therefore require numerical methods to address.

== Kinematic quantities ==
In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other. This is the principle of &quot;compound motion&quot; established by Galileo in 1638, and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion.

A ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude as formula_2 and direction (faraway targets) with latitude/longitude along the trajectory. This causes an elliptic trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. However, if an object was thrown and the Earth was suddenly replaced with a black hole of equal mass, it would become obvious that the ballistic trajectory is part of an elliptic orbit around that &quot;black hole&quot;, and not a parabola that extends to infinity. At higher speeds the trajectory can also be circular (cosmonautics at LEO?, geostationary satellites at 5formula_3 R), parabolic or hyperbolic (unless distorted by other objects like the Moon or the Sun).

In this article a &quot;homogeneous&quot; gravitational acceleration formula_4 is assumed.

=== Acceleration ===
Since there is acceleration only in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to formula_5. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to g. The components of the acceleration are: 
: formula_6,
: formula_7.*

&quot;*The y acceleration can also be referred to as the force of the earth&quot; formula_8 &quot;on the object(s) of interest.&quot;

=== Velocity ===
Let the projectile be launched with an initial velocity formula_9, which can be expressed as the sum of horizontal and vertical components as follows:
:formula_10.
The components formula_11 and formula_12 can be found if the initial launch angle θ is known:
:formula_13,
:formula_14

The horizontal component of the velocity of the object remains unchanged throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly, because the acceleration due to gravity is constant. The accelerations in the x and y directions can be integrated to solve for the components of velocity at any time t, as follows:
: formula_15,
: formula_16.

The magnitude of the velocity (under the Pythagorean theorem, also known as the triangle law):
: formula_17.

=== Displacement ===

At any time formula_18, the projectile&#x27;s horizontal and vertical displacement are:
:formula_19,
:formula_20.
The magnitude of the displacement is:
:formula_21.

Consider the equations,
:formula_19 and formula_23.
If t is eliminated between these two equations the following equation is obtained:
:formula_24
Here R is the range of a projectile.

Since g, θ, and v0 are constants, the above equation is of the form 
:formula_25,
in which a and b are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic. The axis of the parabola is vertical.

If the projectile&#x27;s position (x,y) and launch angle (θ or α) are known, the initial velocity can be found solving for v0 in the afore-mentioned parabolic equation:

:formula_26.

=== Displacement in polar coordinates ===
The parabolic trajectory of a projectile can also be expressed in polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates. In this case, the position has the general formula
:formula_27.
In this equation, the origin is the midpoint of the horizontal range of the projectile, and if the ground is flat, the parabolic arc is plotted in the range formula_28. This expression can be obtained by transforming the Cartesian equation as stated above by formula_29 and formula_30.

== Properties of the trajectory ==
=== Time of flight or total time of the whole journey ===
The total time t for which the projectile remains in the air is called the time-of-flight.
:formula_31

After the flight, the projectile returns to the horizontal axis (x-axis), so formula_32.
:formula_33

:formula_34

:formula_35

Note that we have neglected air resistance on the projectile.

If the starting point is at height y0 with respect to the point of impact, the time of flight is:
: formula_36

As above, this expression can be reduced (y0 is 0) to

: formula_37 = formula_38

if θ equals 45°.

=== Time of flight to the target&#x27;s position ===
As shown above in the Displacement section, the horizontal and vertical velocity of a projectile are independent of each other.

Because of this, we can find the time to reach a target using the displacement formula for the horizontal velocity:

formula_39

formula_40

formula_41

This equation will give the total time &quot;t&quot; the projectile must travel for to reach the target&#x27;s horizontal displacement, neglecting air resistance.

=== Maximum height of projectile ===

The greatest height that the object will reach is known as the peak of the object&#x27;s motion.
The increase in height will last until formula_42, that is,
:formula_43.
Time to reach the maximum height(h):
:formula_44.
For the vertical displacement of the maximum height of the projectile:
:formula_45
:formula_46
The maximum reachable height is obtained for &quot;θ&quot;=90°:
:formula_47

If the projectile&#x27;s position (x,y) and launch angle (θ) are known, the maximum height can be found by solving for h in the following equation:
:formula_48

Angle of elevation (φ) at the maximum height is given by:
:formula_49
=== Relation between horizontal range and maximum height ===
The relation between the range d on the horizontal plane and the maximum height h reached at formula_50 is:
:formula_51
formula_52
:formula_53
:formula_54 × formula_55
:formula_56
formula_51.

If formula_58
:formula_59
=== Maximum distance of projectile ===


The range and the maximum height of the projectile do not depend upon its mass. Hence range and maximum height are equal for all bodies that are thrown with the same velocity and direction. The horizontal range d of the projectile is the horizontal distance it has traveled when it returns to its initial height (formula_60).
: formula_61.

Time to reach ground:
: formula_62.
From the horizontal displacement the maximum distance of the projectile:
: formula_63,
so
: formula_64

Note that d has its maximum value when
: formula_65
which necessarily corresponds to formula_66, or formula_67.

The total horizontal distance (d) traveled.

: formula_68

When the surface is flat (initial height of the object is zero), the distance traveled:

: formula_69

Thus the maximum distance is obtained if θ is 45 degrees. This distance is:

: formula_70

=== Application of the work energy theorem ===
According to the work-energy theorem the vertical component of velocity is:
:formula_71.

These formulae ignore aerodynamic drag and also assume that the landing area is at uniform height 0.

=== Angle of reach ===
The &quot;angle of reach&quot; is the angle (θ) at which a projectile must be launched in order to go a distance d, given the initial velocity v.

: formula_72
There are two solutions:
: formula_73 (shallow trajectory)
and because formula_74,

: formula_75 (steep trajectory)

=== Angle θ required to hit coordinate (x, y) ===

To hit a target at range x and altitude y when fired from (0,0) and with initial speed v, the required angle(s) of launch θ are:

: formula_76

The two roots of the equation correspond to the two possible launch angles, so long as they aren&#x27;t imaginary, in which case the initial speed is not great enough to reach the point (x,y) selected. This formula allows one to find the angle of launch needed without the restriction of formula_77.

One can also ask what launch angle allows the lowest possible launch velocity. This occurs when the two solutions above are equal, implying that the quantity under the square root sign is zero. This, tan θ = v2/gx, requires solving a quadratic equation for formula_78, and we find
:formula_79
This gives
:formula_80

If we denote the angle whose tangent is by , then
:formula_81 its reciprocal:
:formula_82
:formula_83
:formula_84
This implies
:formula_85

In other words, the launch should be at the angle formula_86 halfway between the target and zenith (vector opposite to gravity).

=== Total Path Length of the Trajectory ===
The length of the parabolic arc traced by a projectile, L, given that the height of launch and landing is the same (there is no air resistance), is given by the formula:

:formula_87

where formula_88 is the initial velocity, formula_89 is the launch angle and formula_90 is the acceleration due to gravity as a positive value. The expression can be obtained by evaluating the arc length integral for the height-distance parabola between the bounds &quot;initial&quot; and &quot;final&quot; displacement (i.e. between 0 and the horizontal range of the projectile) such that:

:formula_91

If the time-of-flight is &quot;t&quot;,
:formula_92

== Trajectory of a projectile with air resistance ==

Air resistance creates a force that (for symmetric projectiles) is always directed against the direction of motion in the surrounding medium and has a magnitude that depends on the absolute speed: formula_93. The speed-dependence of the friction force is linear (formula_94) at very low speeds (Stokes drag) and quadratic (formula_95) at large speeds (Newton drag). The transition between these behaviours is determined by the Reynolds number, which depends on object speed and size, density formula_96 and dynamic viscosity formula_97 of the medium. For Reynolds numbers below about 1 the dependence is linear, above 1000 (turbulent flow) it becomes quadratic. In air, which has a kinematic viscosity formula_98 around 0.15 cm2/s, this means that the drag force becomes quadratic in &quot;v&quot; when the product of object speed and diameter is more than about 0.015 m2/s, which is typically the case for projectiles.
* Stokes drag: formula_99 (for formula_100)
* Newton drag: formula_101 (for formula_102)
The free body diagram on the right is for a projectile that experiences air resistance and the effects of gravity. Here, air resistance is assumed to be in the direction opposite of the projectile&#x27;s velocity: formula_103

=== Trajectory of a projectile with Stokes drag ===
Stokes drag, where formula_104, only applies at very low speed in air, and is thus not the typical case for projectiles. However, the linear dependence of formula_105 on formula_106 causes a very simple differential equation of motion
:formula_107
in which the 2 cartesian components become completely independent, and it is thus easier to solve. Here, formula_88,formula_109 and formula_110 will be used to denote the initial velocity, the velocity along the direction of x and the velocity along the direction of y, respectively. The mass of the projectile will be denoted by m, and formula_111. For the derivation only the case where formula_112 is considered. Again, the projectile is fired from the origin (0,0).
The relationships that represent the motion of the particle are derived by Newton&#x27;s Second Law, both in the x and y directions. 
In the x direction formula_113 and in the y direction formula_114.

This implies that:

formula_115 (1),

and

formula_116 (2)

Solving (1) is an elementary differential equation, thus the steps leading to a unique solution for vx and, subsequently, x will not be enumerated. Given the initial conditions formula_117 (where vx0 is understood to be the x component of the initial velocity) and formula_118 for formula_119:

formula_120 (1a)

:formula_121 (1b)

While (1) is solved much in the same way, (2) is of distinct interest because of its non-homogeneous nature. Hence, we will be extensively solving (2). Note that in this case the initial conditions are used formula_122 and formula_32 when formula_119.

formula_125 (2)

formula_126 (2a)

This first order, linear, non-homogeneous differential equation may be solved a number of ways; however, in this instance, it will be quicker to approach the solution via an integrating factor formula_127.

formula_128 (2c)

formula_129 (2d)

formula_130 (2e)

formula_131(2f)

formula_132 (2g)

And by integration we find:

formula_133 (3)

Solving for our initial conditions:

formula_134 (2h)

formula_135 (3a)

With a bit of algebra to simplify (3a):

:formula_136 (3b)
The total time of the journey in the presence of air resistance (more specifically, when formula_137) can be calculated by the same strategy as above, namely, we solve the equation formula_138. While in the case of zero air resistance this equation can be solved elementarily, here we shall need the Lambert W function. The equation

is of the form , and such an equation can be transformed into an equation solvable by the function (see an example of such a transformation here). Some algebra shows that the total time of flight, in closed form, is given as

:formula_139.

=== Trajectory of a projectile with Newton drag ===

The most typical case of air resistance, in case of Reynolds numbers above about 1000, is Newton drag with a drag force proportional to the speed squared, formula_140. In air, which has a kinematic viscosity around 0.15 cm2/s, this means that the product of object speed and diameter must be more than about 0.015 m2/s.

Unfortunately, the equations of motion can not be easily solved analytically for this case. Therefore, a numerical solution will be examined.

The following assumptions are made:
* Constant gravitational acceleration formula_141
* Air resistance is given by the following drag formula,
::formula_142

::Where:

:*&quot;FD&quot; is the drag force,
:*&quot;c&quot; is the drag coefficient,
:*ρ is the air density,
:*&quot;A&quot; is the cross sectional area of the projectile. Again formula_143 formula_144 formula_145. Compare this with theory/practice of the ballistic coefficient.

==== Special cases ====
Even though the general case of a projectile with Newton drag cannot be solved analytically, some special cases can. Here we denote the terminal velocity in free-fall as formula_146 and the characteristic &quot;settling time&quot; constant formula_147. (Dimension of formula_90 [m/s2], formula_149 [1/m])
*Near-horizontal motion: In case the motion is almost horizontal, formula_150, such as a flying bullet. The vertical velocity component has very little influence on the horizontal motion. In this case:
::formula_151
::formula_152
::formula_153
:The same pattern applies for motion with friction along a line in any direction, when gravity is negligible (relatively small formula_90). It also applies when vertical motion is prevented, such as for a moving car with its engine off.

*Vertical motion upward:
::formula_155
::formula_156
::formula_157
:Here
::formula_158 and formula_159
::formula_160
:and
::formula_161
:where formula_162 is the initial upward velocity at formula_163 and the initial position is formula_164.
:A projectile cannot rise longer than formula_165 in the vertical direction, when it reaches the peak (0 m, ypeak) at 0 m/s.

*Vertical motion downward:
::formula_166
::formula_167
::formula_168 With &quot;hyperbolic&quot; functions
:After a time formula_169 at y=0, the projectile reaches almost terminal velocity formula_170.

==== Numerical solution ====
A projectile motion with drag can be computed generically by numerical integration of the ordinary differential equation, for instance by applying a reduction to a first-order system. The equation to be solved is

:formula_171.

This approach also allows to add the effects of speed-dependent drag coefficient, altitude-dependent air density (in product formula_172) and position-dependent gravity field formula_173 (when formula_174, is linear decrease).

==Lofted trajectory==

A special case of a ballistic trajectory for a rocket is a lofted trajectory, a trajectory with an apogee greater than the minimum-energy trajectory to the same range. In other words, the rocket travels higher and by doing so it uses more energy to get to the same landing point. This may be done for various reasons such as increasing distance to the horizon to give greater viewing/communication range or for changing the angle with which a missile will impact on landing. Lofted trajectories are sometimes used in both missile rocketry and in spaceflight.

== Projectile motion on a planetary scale ==

When a projectile travels a range that is significant compared to the Earth&#x27;s radius (above ≈100 km), the curvature of the Earth and the non-uniform Earth&#x27;s gravity have to be considered. This is, for example, the case with spacecrafts and intercontinental missiles. The trajectory then generalizes (without air resistance) from a parabola to a Kepler-ellipse with one focus at the center of the Earth (shown in fig. 3). The projectile motion then follows Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.

The trajectory&#x27;s parameters have to be adapted from the values of a uniform gravity field stated above. The Earth radius is taken as R, and g as the standard surface gravity. Let formula_175 be the launch velocity relative to the first cosmic or escape velocity.

Total range d between launch and impact:
: formula_176 (where launch angle formula_177)
Maximum range of a projectile for optimum launch angle θ=45o:
: formula_178       with formula_179, the first cosmic velocity
Maximum height of a projectile above the planetary surface:
:formula_180
Maximum height of a projectile for vertical launch (formula_181):
:formula_182       with formula_183, the second cosmic velocity, 
Time of flight:
:formula_184

<text>Derek Anthony Enright (2 August 1935 – 31 October 1995) was a British Labour Party politician. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1984, and the MP for Hemsworth from 1991 until his death.

==Early life==
Born in Thornaby-on-Tees, North Riding of Yorkshire, he attended St. Michael&#x27;s College on St John&#x27;s Road, Leeds (which has since merged with Mount St Mary&#x27;s Catholic High School), then a grammar school.

He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, gaining a BA in Classics and a DipEd, and worked as a school teacher of classics at The John Fisher School, a Roman Catholic grammar school in Purley, Surrey, from 1959 to 1967. He taught at St Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic High School in the 1970s, where he taught students to sing &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Ten Green Bottles&quot; in Latin.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected as a Labour Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Leeds in 1979, staying until 1984. He was British Labour group spokesman on third world affairs and women&#x27;s rights, and was later an EC delegate in Guinea Bissau. He contested Kent East in the 1984 European election. He became Member of Parliament (MP) for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire at a 1991 by-election. A devout Catholic, he co-founded, in 1990, the cross-party Movement for Christian Democracy, portions of which later evolved into the Christian Peoples Alliance. He was a strong supporter European integration and the Social Chapter.

On 2 March 1993, during a debate on the Education Reform Bill, Enright mentioned that &quot;To help my pupils discover what the optative and subjunctive are all about, I translated Beatles songs into Latin.&quot; Challenged by Nicholas Fairbairn to sing a Beatles song in Latin, Enright immediately stood up and did so, singing &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; in Latin. The Deputy Speaker, Geoffrey Lofthouse, got him to curtail his performance by reminding Enright of the rules of the House: &quot;Order. The hon. Gentleman has been a Member of the House long enough to know its rules full well.&quot;

==Personal life==
He married Jane Simmons in 1963, and they had two sons and two daughters. His son, Duncan Enright, stood against Michael Heseltine in Henley at the 1997 general election, and against David Cameron in Witney at the 2015 general election. Duncan is a councillor in Witney, Oxfordshire.

Enright died from cancer in London on 31 October 1995, at the age of 60.

<text>Ram Oren (; born 8 March 1936) is a popular Israeli author who has sold an unprecedented 1 million books in Hebrew.

Oren was born in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era. At age 15, he began his journalistic career as a messenger boy for &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot;, and was a correspondent for that newspaper from 1952 to 1955. From 1955 to 1958, he served in the Israel Defense Forces as a reporter for the IDF&#x27;s weekly magazine &quot;Bamahane&quot;. From 1958 to 1963, he studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1964 to 1994, he worked again for &quot;Yediot Aharonot&quot;. He advanced to editorship of important sections in the newspaper, and was at one point its chief correspondent in New York City. He only began his career as a literary writer at a relatively advanced age.

In 1994, he published his first book, &quot;Seduction&quot; (Keter Publishing). The book did not sell well at first, and was considered a commercial failure. Then Oren appeared on Dan Shilon&#x27;s television show, the most popular Israeli talk show at the time. The appearance was a springboard for the book, which turned into one of Israel&#x27;s most popular bestsellers ever. A 2002 movie adaptation was also successful.

Oren&#x27;s success at the tills, nearly unprecedented in Israeli publishing, led him to found a publishing house, &quot;Keshet&quot;. Founded in 1996, the company advertises Oren&#x27;s books as well as bestsellers by authors such as Shifra Horn, Irit Linoor, Shelly Yachimovich, and Koby Oz.

Oren&#x27;s books are known for their fast pace and gripping plots. Since his first success, Oren tries to present a picture of various phenomena in the national culture, such as the seeking of eastern mysticism in ashrams. His books have been translated into several languages, including English and French.

Most of his books are in the detective fiction genre. In 2002 his first book presenting a historical episode was published, &quot;Latrun&quot;, employing his compelling, readable style. In 2004 he published another book in this category, &quot;Target: Tel Aviv&quot;, concerning the Egyptian Army&#x27;s invasion of Israel in the War of Independence.

Oren lives in Tel Aviv. He has been married to his wife Nitza since 1961. They have three children and grandchildren.

<text>German Earth and Stone Works (, ) was an SS-owned company created to procure and manufacture building materials for state construction projects in Nazi Germany. DEST was a subsidiary company of &quot;Amtsgruppe W&quot; (&quot;Amt. W&quot;) of SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (WVHA). Both &quot;Amt. W&quot; and the WVHA were headed by Waffen-SS generals Oswald Pohl and Georg Lörner.

The headquarters for DEST were located in Sankt Georgen an der Gusen, a small town in Austria where Gusen II, a subcamp of Mauthausen, was built in 1944.

==History==
&quot;DEST&quot;, founded on April 29, 1938, in Berlin, was administered by the &quot;WHVA&quot; for the purpose of procuring building materials and organizing slave labor and overseeing quarry operations.
The Sachsenhausen (1936), Buchenwald (1937), Flossenbürg (1938), Mauthausen (1938), Natzweiler-Struthof (1939), Gross Rosen (1940) and Neuengamme (1940) concentration camp sites were chosen because of their proximity to soil suitable for making bricks, or due to the close proximity of a brickworks factory or stone quarry. 
&quot;DEST&quot; was widely successful in the exploitation of slave labor, most of whom were Jews, in the quarries. Human labor was used cruelly, becoming one of the main tenets of war crime charges in the Nuremberg Trials. The director of the program, &quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Oswald Pohl, who was stationed in Berlin, was sentenced to death for war crimes in 1947 in Nuremberg, and executed in 1951.

In 1943, &quot;DEST&quot; changed its focus from stone industry to armaments. From this time the organization played a key role, helping the SS to enter some key war industries. This was underlined by its industrial park at St. Georgen and Gusen that made the SS a key supplier of aircraft fuselages (Bf 109, Me 262), carbines and machine guns to companies like BFW, Messerschmitt and Steyr-Daimler-Puch. To run its business with the inmates of the Gusen and Mauthausen concentration camps, &quot;DEST&quot; operated its headquarters of &quot;Granitwerke Mauthausen&quot; between 1940 and 1945 in the town of Sankt Georgen an der Gusen which was its biggest and most important &quot;Werkgruppe&quot; (industry group).

<text>Westside Seattle, formerly The Westside Weekly, is a weekly newspaper that serves the areas of West Seattle, Ballard, White Center, Burien, Des Moines, and SeaTac in Washington state.

==History==
In 1952, Gerald “Jerry” Robinson, owner of Robinson Newspapers, purchased the &quot;White Center News&quot; (1923). He founded the &quot;Federal Way News&quot; in 1954 and launched the &quot;Des Monies News&quot; in 1963. He bought the &quot;West Seattle Herald&quot; (1923) in 1974 and acquired the &quot;Highline Times&quot; of Burien a few years later.

In 1989, Robinson&#x27;s five newspaper operation was sold to American Community Newspapers and he retired. In 1991, The Seattle Times Company acquired three of those newspapers (&quot;Federal Way News&quot;, &quot;Highline Times&quot; and &quot;Des Monies News&quot;) in bankruptcy court. Robinson also bought back the &quot;West Seattle Herald&quot; and &quot;White Center News&quot;. The Seattle Times later shuttered those three papers in 1997. This promoted Robinson to relaunch the newspapers and Sound Publishing to launch the &quot;Federal Way Mirror&quot;.

In 1993, Robinson acquired the &quot;Ballard News-Tribune&quot; of Ballard (founded in 1963 after &quot;The Ballard News&quot; and &quot;The Ballard Tribune&quot; merged) and the &quot;Monroe Monitor and Valley News&quot; (1899). The &quot;Monitor&quot; was later sold to RIM Publications.

On August 21, 2013, Robinson Newspapers announced that it would combine the &quot;Ballard News-Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Highline Times&quot;, the &quot;West Seattle Herald&quot;, and &quot;White Center News&quot; into &quot;The Westside Weekly&quot; on September 6, 2013. In 2014, Amanda Knox began writing for the paper. Jerry Robinson died in 2014, and ownership of the paper was passed down to his three sons. The paper&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;The Westside Weekly&quot; to &quot;Westside Seattle&quot; in June 2017. The newspaper published its final print issue on April 30, 2021, but continued to maintain an online presence.

<doc id="862736" wikidata="Q421761" url="?curid=862736" title="Acetanilide">
<text>Acetanilide is the organic compound with the formula . It is the N-acetylated derivative of aniline. It is an odourless solid chemical of leaf or flake-like appearance. It is also known as &quot;N&quot;-phenylacetamide, acetanil, or acetanilid, and was formerly known by the trade name Antifebrin.

==Preparation and properties==
Acetanilide can be produced by reacting acetic anhydride with aniline: 
:C6H5NH2 + (CH3CO)2O → C6H5NHCOCH3 + CH3COOH

The preparation used to be a traditional experiment in introductory organic chemistry lab classes, but it has now been widely replaced by the preparation of either paracetamol or aspirin, both of which teach the same practical techniques (especially recrystallization of the product) but which avoid the use of aniline, a suspected carcinogen.

Acetanilide is slightly soluble in water, and stable under most conditions. Pure crystals are plate shaped and appear colorless, white, or in between.

==Applications==
Acetanilide is used as an inhibitor of hydrogen peroxide decomposition and is used to stabilize cellulose ester varnishes. It has also found uses in the intermediation in rubber accelerator synthesis, dyes and dye intermediate synthesis, and camphor synthesis. Acetanilide is used for the production of 4-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride, a key intermediate for the manufacture of the sulfa drugs.

In the 19th century acetanilide was one of a large number of compounds used as experimental photographic developers.

During the same period of time, acetanilide was introduced into medical practice as a fever-reducing agent under the name Antifebrin. It was one of the first aniline derivatives found to possess analgesic and antipyretic properties. However, its use was later discontinued due to toxic side effects, including methemoglobinemia, which led to cyanosis. 

Acetanilide derived herbicides have been used since the 1960s or earlier. These include alachlor, metolachlor and xylachlor.

===Pharmaceutical use===
Acetanilide was the first aniline derivative found to possess analgesic as well as antipyretic properties, and was quickly introduced into medical practice under the names of Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But its (apparent) unacceptable toxic effects, the most alarming being cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia and ultimately liver and kidney damage, prompted the search for supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives such as phenacetin. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in the human body, and that it was this metabolite that was responsible for the analgesic and antipyretic properties. The observed methemoglobinemia after acetanilide administration was ascribed to the small proportion of acetanilide that is hydrolyzed to aniline in the body.

<text>John McKee Spratt Jr. (November 1, 1942 – December 14, 2024) was an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 1983 to 2011. The 5th Congressional District covers all or part of 14 counties in north-central South Carolina. The largest cities are Rock Hill and Sumter. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

Spratt was the dean of the South Carolina congressional delegation, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Budget, and the second ranking Democrat on the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services, where he served on three subcommittees: Oversight and Investigations, Strategic Forces, and Air and Land Forces. In addition to his committee work, he co-chaired the Textile Caucus, the Bearing Caucus, and the Nuclear Energy Caucus.

In 2010, Spratt lost his seat to Republican challenger Mick Mulvaney.

==Background==
Spratt was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, on November 1, 1942, and raised in York, South Carolina. His father founded the Bank of Fort Mill and the York law firm where he would eventually practice. His only sibling is Jane Bratton Spratt McColl, wife of Hugh McColl, former chairman and chief executive officer of Bank of America Corporation.

After graduating from York High School, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Davidson College in 1964. He served as student body president at both schools. Spratt then earned an MA degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from Oxford University (Corpus Christi College) in 1966 while studying on a Marshall Scholarship, and an LLB degree from Yale Law School in 1969.

Spratt was a captain in the Army from 1969 to 1971, serving in the Operations Analysis Group in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) at the Pentagon, and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.

Spratt returned to York in 1971 to practice at the law firm of Spratt, McKeown, and Spratt. He was county attorney and school board attorney, and president of the Bank of Fort Mill. He also ran a small insurance agency and owned a farm in Fort Mill.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

For his work in Congress, Spratt won praise from Columbia&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The State&quot;, which called him &quot;one of his party&#x27;s most reliable &#x27;bridges&#x27; to the Republican side.&quot; &quot;National Journal&quot; featured him on its cover as &quot;a stand-out&quot; in Congress, comparing his legislative skills to the &quot;best infielders in baseball.&quot; In a &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine survey, Congressional staff voted him a &quot;Workhorse&quot; and &quot;House Member I&#x27;d Like to See Win the Presidency in 2008.&quot;

Spratt co-authored the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, putting the federal budget in surplus for the first time in 30 years. In 2003, Spratt engineered an amendment which shifted $30 million in the defense appropriations bill to the Airborne Laser program.

In the 111th Congress, Spratt supported legislation such as the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, extension of unemployment benefits, increased infrastructure and labor workforce funding, increased federal financial aid packages, increased home foreclosure and small business assistance, reduction in estate taxes for 99.8 percent of estates, clean water legislation, health insurance reform, expansion of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, reforming of medicare payment plans, clean energy legislation, pay as you go legislation, defense authorization for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and increased VA hospital investment.

On March 21, 2010, Spratt joined a majority of his House colleagues in approving H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Senate version of the health care reform bill. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he made the floor motion which led to the vote on the bill. &quot;I was where the action was when the bill had to be called from the clerk&#x27;s desk,&quot; he told &quot;The Herald&quot;, a Rock Hill, South Carolina newspaper. &quot;It was like sharing a moment in history.&quot;

On March 24, 2010, Spratt was appointed to the president&#x27;s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. In reporting on the appointment, Dow Jones Newswires called Spratt &quot;one of the staunchest fiscal conservatives among House Democrats.&quot; One of Spratt&#x27;s last acts in Congress was helping compile a 65-page report on fixing the country&#x27;s financial deficit.

==Political campaigns==
Spratt became active in politics within the Democratic Party at an early age, and was elected delegate to the 1964 Democratic National Convention, which he attended at the age of 22. Spratt was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1982, succeeding fellow Democrat Kenneth Holland. He was reelected 13 more times. Although parts of the district were becoming friendlier to Republican candidates at the national level, the GOP was more or less nonexistent in this part of South Carolina at the local level for some time; Spratt only faced a Republican opponent twice from 1984 to 1992, winning easily in both instances. In 1994, however, Spratt was nearly defeated by Republican Larry Bigham, only surviving by a margin of 6,300 votes. He defeated Bigham by a slightly larger margin in 1996, but from 1998 to 2008 Spratt usually won with relatively little difficulty due to his popularity and campaigning skills.

Spratt typically stayed out of presidential politics while he was a congressman because the national party was not popular in his district. For instance, he did not endorse any candidate in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Nonetheless, he was rumored to have been President Obama&#x27;s pick as White House Budget Director, though President Obama instead chose Peter R. Orszag, whom Spratt had helped hire as the director of the Congressional Budget Office.

=== 2010 ===
In 2010, John Spratt&#x27;s re-election chances was the subject of numerous articles. He was seen as particularly vulnerable due to his ties with the Democratic party leadership, his district&#x27;s double-digit unemployment rate, and the district&#x27;s growing Republican base. He was defeated that year by Mick Mulvaney by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent—one of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in the 2010 cycle.

Mulvaney successfully weaponized Spratt&#x27;s bipartisan credentials against him during the election. He lamented that Spratt was no longer fiscally conservative like he had once been in 1997 when he helped balance the nation&#x27;s budget and criticized his relationship with Nancy Pelosi. The National Republican Congressional Committee called John Spratt an &quot;amnesiac&quot; and stated he was forgetting what was going on in Washington. Notably, President Barack Obama flew into Charlotte with Spratt on Air Force One during the campaign. Spratt was among three Democratic U.S. House chairmen who lost that year to Tea Party candidates.

==Personal life==
On May 31, 1968, Spratt married Jane Stacy of Filbert, South Carolina. They had three daughters, Susan Spratt, Sarah Spratt, and Catherine Spratt, along with five grandchildren, Lily Tendler, Jack Tendler, Max Tendler, Jane Grace Brennan, and James Brennan. Spratt lived in York, South Carolina, where he was a member of the local First Presbyterian Church. He was active in the United Way and other civic and charity organizations. He was brother-in-law to Hugh McColl, CEO of Bank of America and NationsBank. After his departure from Congress, Spratt served as Visiting Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at Winthrop University.

In 2010, Spratt was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died from the disease at his home on December 14, 2024, at the age of 82. His funeral service was held on December 18, 2024, at York&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church, followed by burial at Rose Hill Cemetery. At the funeral service, a eulogy was delivered by Jim Clyburn, congressman for South Carolina&#x27;s 6th congressional district and Spratt&#x27;s colleague in congress from 1993 to 2011. Clyburn described Spratt as &quot;an inconspicuous genius and the most ordinary, extraordinary person I have ever known.&quot; Governor Henry McMaster announced that flags would be flown at half-staff on the day of his funeral.

<text>Portulaca oleracea (common purslane, also known as little hogweed, or pursley) is a succulent plant in the family Portulacaceae.

== Description ==

The plant may reach in height. It has smooth, reddish, mostly prostrate stems, and the leaves, which may be alternate or opposite, are clustered at stem joints and ends. The yellow flowers have five regular parts and are up to wide. Depending upon rainfall, the flowers appear at any time during the year. The flowers open singly at the center of the leaf cluster for only a few hours on sunny mornings. The tiny seeds are formed in a pod that opens when the seeds mature. Purslane has a taproot with fibrous secondary roots and can tolerate poor soil and drought.

The fruits are many-seeded capsules. The seed set is considerable; one plant can develop up to 193,000 seeds. The seeds germinate optimally at a temperature above 25 °C; they are light germinators, with even a soil cover of 5 mm having a negative effect on germination.

Although usually an annual plant, it is a tropical perennial in United States Department of Agriculture growing zones 10–11).

=== Metabolism ===
&quot;P. oleracea&quot; is one of the very few plants able to utilize both C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis pathways, long believed to be incompatible with each other despite biochemical similarities. &quot;P. oleracea&quot; will switch from C4 to CAM pathways during drought, and there is transcription regulation and physiological evidence for C4-CAM hybrid photosynthesis during mild drought.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;P. oleracea&quot; was recorded in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Due to the great variability, a large number of subspecies and varieties have been described as species of their own, but according to other publications, they all fall within the range of variation of &quot;P. oleracea&quot;. The synonyms &quot;P. oleracea&quot; subsp. &quot;sativa&quot;, &quot;P. sativa&quot;, and &quot;P. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;sativa&quot;, which are more common in the literature, refer to a somewhat more robust form in cultivation with larger seeds that cannot be separated from the species. Approximately 40 cultivars of &quot;P. oleracea&quot; are currently grown.

The flowering plant more commonly known as winter purslane (&quot;Claytonia perfoliata&quot;) is a member of the Montiaceae family and is not closely related.

=== Etymology ===
The specific epithet &quot;oleracea&quot; means &quot;vegetable/herbal&quot; in Latin and is a form of (), from &#x27;vegetable&#x27;. The genus name is simply the plant&#x27;s name in Latin.

===Varieties===
Two varieties are accepted.
*&quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot; var. &quot;delicatula&quot; – endemic to Aldabra in the Seychelles
*&quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot; var. &quot;oleracea&quot; – native to full species range

== Distribution and habitat ==
Purslane has an extensive distribution, assumed to be mostly anthropogenic (or hemerochoric), extending from North Africa and Southern Europe through the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent to Malesia and Australasia. The species status in the Americas is uncertain. In general, it is often considered an exotic weed, but there is evidence that the species was in Crawford Lake deposits (Ontario) in 1350–1539, suggesting that it reached North America in the pre-Columbian era. Scientists suggested that the plant was already eaten by Native Americans, who spread its seeds. How it reached the Americas is currently unknown.

==Ecology==
Compared to other common crops, &quot;P. oleracea&quot; is more tolerant of pests due to its waxy cover, which protects the plant from insects and diseases. In some instances, &quot;P. oleracea&quot; is even known to have antifungal properties. However some phytotoxic metabolites of &quot;Drechslera indica&quot;, a fungus, can cause necrosis on purslane. &quot;Dichotomophthora portulacae&quot;, another fungus, can cause stem rot. &quot;P. oleracea&quot; is a known host plant of &quot;Hyles lineata&quot;.

&quot;Schizocerella pilicornis&quot; and &quot;Hypurus bertrandi&quot; are known to feed on &quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;. In some instances, they may help control the competitiveness of &quot;P. oleracea&quot; to prevent weed infestation in fields where &quot;P. oleracea&quot; is not wanted, however, they do not stop it from growing completely.

==Uses==
=== Nutrition ===
Raw purslane is 93% water, 3% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, purslane supplies 20 calories, and rich amounts (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin E (81% DV) and vitamin C (25% DV), with moderate content (11–19% DV) of several dietary minerals. Purslane is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid.

=== Culinary ===
All parts of purslane are edible raw or cooked. The seeds can be eaten raw or used to make flour.

The plant may be eaten as a leaf vegetable. William Cobbett noted that it was &quot;eaten by Frenchmen and pigs when they can get nothing else. Both use it in salad, that is to say, raw&quot;. It has a slightly sour and salty taste and is eaten throughout much of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Mexico. The stems, leaves, and flower buds are all edible raw or cooked. Purslane may be used fresh as a salad, stir-fried, or cooked as spinach is, and because of its mucilaginous quality it also is suitable for soups and stews. The sour taste is due to oxalic and malic acid, the latter of which is produced through the CAM pathway that is seen in many xerophytes (plants living in dry conditions) and is at its highest when the plant is harvested in the early morning.

Aboriginal Australians use the seeds of purslane to make seedcakes. Greeks, who call it () or (), use the leaves and the stems with feta cheese, tomato, onion, garlic, oregano, and olive oil. They add it to salads, boil it, or add it to casseroled chicken. In Turkey, besides being used in salads and baked pastries, it is cooked as a vegetable similar to spinach or is mixed with yogurt to form a tzatziki variant. In Egypt, the vegetable is known as &quot;regla&quot; (رجلة) it is also cooked as a vegetable stew, similar to how spinach and malva (خبيزة) are cooked, but not fresh in salads.
In Kurdistan, people commonly make a kind of soup from it called palpina soup (شۆربای پەڵپینە). In the Alentejo region of Portugal, purslane is used for cooking a traditional soup (sopa de beldroegas) which is topped with soaked bread, poached eggs, and/or goats&#x27; cheese. In Mexico and the American Southwest, the plant is consumed as &quot;verdolagas.&quot;

=== Soil salinity ===
Salination of agricultural soils decreases the yields of many crops, and salt-sensitive species can no longer be cultivated on such soils. Purslane has a high tolerance for salt, making it suitable for cropping in areas where irrigation is carried out with water with high chloride-based salinity.

Purslane can remove salt from the cultivation medium under saline conditions. As an intercrop or during one growing season, it can remove 210 kg/ha of chloride and 65 kg/ha of sodium when cultivated at 6.5 dS *m−1, allowing growth of salt-sensitive plants on saline soils. In salty conditions, purslane has a positive effect on companion plants such as tomatoes.

==Culture==
Archaeobotanical finds are common at many Mediterranean prehistoric sites. In historic contexts, seeds have been retrieved from a protogeometric layer in Kastanas, as well as from the Samian Heraion dating to the 7th century BC. In the 4th century BC, Theophrastus names purslane, (), as one of the several summer pot herbs that must be sown in April (&quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot; 7.1.2). As &quot;Portulaca&quot; it figures in the long list of comestibles enjoyed by the Milanese given by Bonvesin de la Riva in his &quot;Marvels of Milan&quot; (1288).

In antiquity, its healing properties were thought so reliable that Pliny the Elder advised wearing the plant as an amulet to expel all evil (&quot;Natural History&quot; 20.210).

The plant is mentioned in Rabbinic literature variably as &quot;rgila&quot; (), &quot;ḥalaglogit&quot; (), and &quot;parpaḥonya&quot; (). The Babylonian Talmud recounts that sages were initially unfamiliar with the term &quot;ḥaloglogot&quot;. However, they realised it was the same as &quot;parpaḥonya&quot; after witnessing Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi&#x27;s maidservant reprimand a man who was scattering the plant while using this term. The plant is also mentioned in a &quot;piyyut&quot; by Eleazar ben Kalir, by Maimonides, and by Tanhum of Jerusalem. Tanhum states that the plant is known to medics as &quot;the fast vegetable&quot; due to its quick spreading and branching.

&quot;Verdolaga&quot;, the Spanish word for purslane, is a nickname for South American football clubs with green-white schemes in their uniforms, including Colombia&#x27;s Atletico Nacional and Argentina&#x27;s Ferrocarril Oeste. Afro-Colombian singer Totó la Momposina sings a song entitled “La Verdolaga.”

<doc id="862741" wikidata="Q7700261" url="?curid=862741" title="Tennessee v. Lane">
<text>Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States involving Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Background==
The plaintiffs were disabled Tennesseans who could not access the upper floors in state courthouses. They sued in federal court, arguing that since Tennessee was denying them public services because of their disabilities, it was violating Title II of the &quot;Americans with Disabilities Act&quot; (ADA). Under Title II, no one can be denied access to public services due to his or her disability; it allows those whose rights have been violated to sue states for money damages.

Tennessee argued that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the suit, and filed a motion to dismiss the case. It relied principally on &quot;Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett&quot; (2001), in which the Supreme Court held that Congress had, in enacting certain provisions of the &quot;ADA&quot;, unconstitutionally abrogated the sovereign immunity of the States by letting people sue the States for discrimination on the basis of disability. That case, in turn, relied on the rule laid down by &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot;: Congress may abrogate the Eleventh Amendment using its section 5 powers only if the way it seeks to remedy discrimination is &quot;congruent and proportional&quot; to the discrimination itself. &quot;Garrett&quot; had held that Congress had not met the congruent-and-proportional test – i.e., that it had not amassed enough evidence of discrimination on the basis of disability to justify the abrogation of sovereign immunity.

==Opinion of the Court==
In &quot;Lane&quot;, the Supreme Court split 5–4. In the majority opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court ruled that Congress did have enough evidence that disabled people were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, among those rights being the right to access a court. Further, the remedy Congress enacted was congruent and proportional, because the &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; mandated by the &quot;ADA&quot; were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm. &quot;Garrett&quot;, the Court said, applied only to Equal Protection claims, not to Due Process claims. Therefore, the law was constitutional. Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia filed dissents.

<text>Wadborough is a small village 2 miles outside Pershore and 7 miles from Worcester. The village is in Worcestershire, England. The village is an old farming community, with its nearest church a mile away in Pirton.

In the 2001 census the parish of Drakes Broughton and Wadborough recorded a population of 1,762. Wadborough itself has approximately 200 inhabitants. Wadborough has one public house, the Mason’s Arms. The village has one bus service, the 382, which runs between Pershore and Worcester, once an hour in both directions.

==History==

Wadborough is first mentioned in the 10th century when Edgar, King of England confirmed that four manses (priests’ houses) there belonged to Pershore Abbey. The Abbey owned most of the land in the area. Place-names like Abbottswood and Hermitage Farm reflect a long church ownership. Wadborough appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Wadberge, meaning Old English wad &quot;woad&quot; beorg &quot;hill&quot;. Woad dye production was usually carried out at some distance from towns (Wadborough is about four miles from Pershore) because of the offensive smells produced.

Wadborough railway station was situated west of the village on the Bristol to Birmingham main rail line. The line remains open and high-speed trains regularly pass through, but the station closed in January 1965.

<doc id="862749" wikidata="Q1273595" url="?curid=862749" title="E.S. Posthumus">
<text>E.S. Posthumus was an independent music group that produced a form of 21st-century classical music/epic music that intertwined popular style drum rhythms with orchestral and electronic sounds. Their music is inspired by the Pythagorean philosophy which states that &quot;music is the harmonization of opposites; the conciliation of warring elements&quot;. The &quot;E.S.&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Experimental Sounds&quot; while &quot;Posthumus&quot; (Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;last&quot; or &quot;born after father&#x27;s death&quot;; the English spelling is influenced by &quot;&quot;, &quot;ground&quot;, &quot;soil&quot;) is a word that is meant to represent &quot;all things past&quot;, suggesting the music was inspired by things that have ended, some time after they ended.

==Career==
The group was formed in 2000 by brothers Helmut and Franz Vonlichten. Helmut and Franz studied piano with their mother. After graduating from high school, Franz worked in recording studios while Helmut attended and graduated from UCLA, with a degree in archaeology. Their music has been licensed by many movie and television production studios, being included in numerous movie trailers and television shows. E.S. Posthumus released three albums overall in their career.

On July 22, 2010, it was officially announced that Franz had died about two months before. After reporting his brother&#x27;s death, Helmut stated that while there still may be one or two unreleased songs (one of them being their single &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; released in November 2010), the group would no longer be active. In November 2011, it was officially announced that Helmut Vonlichten had formed a new band called Les Friction, and released a preview of his new work with a track called &quot;Torture&quot;.

==Albums==

===Unearthed===

Unearthed was the first album composed by E.S. Posthumus. It was originally made available for purchase online through CD Baby in January 2001; It became the third-biggest selling album in CDBaby&#x27;s history. The success of the album prompted the wide re-release to retail in May 2005 through Wigshop and 33rd Street Records/Bayside Distribution. A key piece to the distinctive sound of the music comes from working with the Northwest Sinfonia. Other musicians performing on this CD include Pedro Eustache, Michael Landau, Matt Laug, Lance Morrison, Davy Spillane and Efrain Toro. Many tracks from Unearthed have been featured in various movie trailers and television shows. They have been used in the trailers for movies due to their escalating structure, which makes them well-suited for dramatic montages building towards the credits in trailers.

===Cartographer===
&quot;Cartographer&quot;, the second album from E.S. Posthumus, was supposed to be released sometime in 2006 but was actually released in early 2007. It is rumored the delay was due to the addition of Sans to the group of musicians, an addition much heralded by Helmut Vonlichten

===Makara===
Makara is the third album of E.S. Posthumus. It consists of 15 tracks and was released on February 2, 2010, for download on iTunes, Amazon MP3, and several other popular download services. The album is available on both CD and for digital download at CD Baby. The album was made available on eMusic on January 26, 2010. There may also be a vinyl release of the album in the future.

==Singles==

===Rise to Glory===

Rise to Glory is a single released in September 2005 featuring the vocals of rappers DJ Quik and Bizarre (from D12). The song &quot;Rise to Glory&quot; is recognized as a sung remix and an extended version of &quot;Posthumus Zone&quot;, which is most commonly recognized as the theme song to the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; since the 2003 season.

===Run This Town/Posthumus Zone===
E.S. Posthumus collaborated with hip hop artist Jay-Z to create a remix of Run This Town and Posthumus Zone for the CBS broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV.

===Christmas Eve===

Christmas Eve is a single released in November 2010 as a Christmas tribute to Franz Vonlichten of E.S. Posthumus.

The Vonlichten brothers had begun work on a holiday project in early March 2010, which was to be released later during the holiday season. According to Helmut, the project would be a re-arrangement of their favorite holiday songs and &quot;bring something new to the party&quot;. This track was the only song they started recording before Franz died in May 2010.

In a Facebook posting on the group&#x27;s fanpage, mid-November 2010, Helmut relayed that &quot;When Franz passed away last May, the project was barely off the ground; however, a lyric, piano sketch and rough vocal were completed on the new song.&quot; In that same posting, Helmut shared that he contacted Jeremy Lubbock, the brothers&#x27; childhood favorite arranger, to arrange the song for them. Helmut later salvaged the rough vocal recorded months earlier and included it in the final recording.

&quot;Christmas Eve&quot; is the last song produced from the group E.S. Posthumus and is a product of the Vonlichten brothers&#x27; last recording session before Franz&#x27;s death.

<text>North Antrim is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Jim Allister (TUV).

==Boundaries==
1950–1974: The Boroughs of Ballymena and Larne, the Urban Districts of Ballycastle, Ballymoney, and Portrush, the Rural Districts of Ballycastle, Ballymena, and Ballymoney, and in the Rural District of Larne the electoral divisions of Ardclinis, Ballycor, Carncastle, Glenarm North, Glenarm South, Glencloy, and Kilwaughter.

1974–1983: The Boroughs of Ballymena, Carrickfergus, and Larne, the Urban Districts of Ballycastle, Ballymoney, Portrush, and Whitehead, the Rural Districts of Ballycastle, Ballymena, and Ballymoney, and in the Rural District of Larne the electoral divisions of Ardclinis, Ballycor, Carncastle, Eden, Glenarm North, Glenarm South, Glencloy, Glynn, Islandmagee North, Islandmagee South, Kilwaughter, Middle Division, Raloo, and Templecorran.

1983–2010: The District of Ballymena, the District of Ballymoney, and the District of Moyle.

2010–present: The District of Ballymena, the District of Ballymoney, and the District of Moyle wards of Armoy, Ballylough, Bushmills, Bonamargy and Rathlin, Carnmoon, Dalriada, Dunseverick, Glenshesk, Glentaisie, Kinbane, Knocklayd, Moss Side, and Moyarget.

North Antrim has always been a county constituency comprising the northern part of County Antrim in the north-east of Northern Ireland. It has the sea to the north and east and parts of the border with County Londonderry to the west – the County Antrim town of Portrush is included in the East Londonderry constituency (although it was in this seat until 1983).
From 1885, this constituency was one of four county divisions carved out of the former constituency of Antrim. It comprised the baronies of Cary, Dunluce Lower, Dunluce Upper and Kilconway and returned one Member of Parliament from 1885 until 1922, when it was merged into a new Antrim constituency.

North Antrim was re-created in 1950 when the old Antrim two MP constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single member seats.

The constituency is largely rural. Amongst the features within its boundaries are Rathlin Island and Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

The Boundary Commission initially proposed alterations for the boundaries of North Antrim prior to the 2010 general election. It was proposed to transfer Ballycastle and the Glens, including Rathlin Island, in Moyle to East Antrim and rename that seat Antrim Coast &amp; Glens. However that proposal raised many questions, with some arguing that the Glens have no natural ties to Jordanstown. Following consultation and revision, the constituency alterations were passed through the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order.

==History==
North Antrim is an overwhelmingly unionist seat. It first existed from 1885 to 1922. From 1886 to 1974 the Conservative and Unionist members of the United Kingdom House of Commons formed a single Parliamentary party.

Unusually for Ireland, the Liberal Party retained significant strength in this constituency after the split over Home Rule in 1886. The Irish Parliamentary Party never contested the seat.

In 1906 the constituency was won by a Russellite Unionist, at least somewhat linked to the Liberal Party. Although the Unionists regained the seat when the sitting MP retired, the constituency was one of very few Unionist/Liberal marginals in Ireland at both 1910 elections.

A victory for the Unionist candidate in 1918 by 9,621 votes to Sinn Féin&#x27;s 2,673 votes demonstrated the strength of the unionist support in the area.

In 1922, the constituency reverted to being part of the two member Antrim seat (as it had been before 1885). North Antrim was re-created in 1950 as a larger seat than it had been in its first incarnation. County Antrim, excluding the parts in the Belfast constituencies, was split into two divisions instead of four as previously. The 1950 North Antrim was comparable to the North and Mid Antrim divisions which had existed from 1885 to 1922.

Since 1950 the Westminster elections have been relatively uncompetitive. In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a UK general election. More recently, one man repeatedly won by a large majority: Ian Paisley was first elected as a Protestant Unionist Party candidate in the 1970 general election after narrowly defeating sitting member Henry Clark. The following year that party changed to the Democratic Unionist Party and Paisley easily held the seat for 40 years until his retirement in 2010. This is the longest continuous period for which the current holding party has held any Northern Irish seat. In elections at all levels, the DUP have frequently had their highest share of the vote in North Antrim and have rarely been seriously challenged.

In March 2010 Ian Paisley announced that he would step down at the 2010 general election. His son Ian Paisley Jr was selected by the DUP to replace him as candidate. Former DUP MEP Jim Allister announced that he would contest the constituency for the Traditional Unionist Voice. Paisley Jr was elected with a significantly reduced majority.

In July 2018 North Antrim was the site of the first recall petition UK held in the under the provisions of the Recall of MPs Act 2015. This petition was launched following a critical report into Paisley Jr&#x27;s conduct in respect to an undeclared trip to Sri Lanka, and Paisley Jr subsequently being suspended from the Commons for 30 days. The petition was signed by 9.4% of the electorate, short of the 10% required to unseat Paisley Jr and trigger a by-election.

== Members of Parliament ==
The Member of Parliament since the 2024 general election is Jim Allister of the TUV, after the DUP lost the seat for the first time since gaining it in 1970 as the Protestant Unionist Party.

North Antrim has had comparatively few MPs in its lifetime compared to other parliamentary constituencies. Sir Hugh O&#x27;Neill had sat for one of the predecessor seats of Mid Antrim between 1915 and 1922 and Antrim between 1922 until 1950, making this one of the few seats where four individuals between them represented the seat continuously over a period of ninety years.

<text>Taxi Orange was an alternative to the &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality show. It was broadcast by the public television channel ORF. The idea, like &quot;Big Brother&quot;, was to lock up a group of people in a closed environment, only allowed to leave operating an orange taxi within the city of Vienna as a source of income and interaction with the world outside.

The habitat and the taxi interior were videotaped and used to produce a 30-minute daily summary. Each week, viewers elected a winner who had to decide on the exclusion of one colleague. The winner received 1 million Schillings. Two seasons (2000, 2001) were produced.

The show was adapted into Turkish as &quot;Biri Bizi Gözetliyor&quot; (Someone is watching us).

<doc id="862774" wikidata="Q1094801" url="?curid=862774" title="Concerto for Two Violins (Bach)">
<text>The Concerto for Two Violins in D minor, BWV 1043, also known as the Double Violin Concerto, is a violin concerto of the Late Baroque era, which Johann Sebastian Bach composed around 1730. It is one of the composer&#x27;s most successful works.

== History ==
Bach composed his Concerto for Two Violins in D minor, BWV 1043, around 1730, as part of a concert series he ran as the Director of the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig. The concerto was later arranged as a concerto for two harpsichords by Bach himself as BWV 1062.

==Structure==
The concerto is characterized by a subtle yet expressive relationship between the violins throughout the work. In addition to the two soloists, the concerto is scored for strings (first violin, second violin and viola parts) and basso continuo. The musical structure of this piece uses fugal imitation and much counterpoint.

The concerto comprises three movements:
# Vivace in D minor, 
# Largo ma non tanto in F major, 
# Allegro in D minor, 

Performance time of the concerto ranges from less than 13 minutes to over 18 minutes.

==Reception==

Around 1736–1737 Bach arranged the concerto for two harpsichords, transposed into C minor, BWV 1062.

1734–1738 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach performed the concerto in Frankfurt an der Oder. After his father&#x27;s death in 1750, Carl Philipp Emanuel inherited some of the original performance parts, likely doubles, of the concerto (surviving: parts for soloists and continuo), and likely also the composer&#x27;s autograph score (lost). The extant original parts were later owned by , and were added to the Royal Library at Berlin (later converted to the Berlin State Library) in the 1840s. After the Second World War they were lost for several decades, eventually resurfacing in Poland.

Manuscript copies of (parts of) the concerto were produced around 1730–1740, in 1760, around 1760, around 1760–1789, and in the early 19th century. The concerto was first published in 1852, by Edition Peters, edited by Siegfried Dehn. In the first volume of his Bach biography (1873), Philipp Spitta describes the concerto as a product of the composer&#x27;s Köthen period (1717–1723). After describing Bach&#x27;s other extant violin concertos, those in E major (BWV 1042) and A minor (BWV 1041), he adds:

The Bach Gesellschaft published the concerto in 1874, edited by Wilhelm Rust. The Neue Bachgesellschaft reports around 25 known public performances of the concerto in the period from late 1904 to early 1907: most of these in Germany, but also performances in other European cities, including London, Madrid, Paris, Riga, St. Petersburg and Vienna, are mentioned. Outside of Europe, there was for instance the performance by Eugène Ysaÿe and Fritz Kreisler in New York in 1905. In London, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Double&quot; became a repertoire piece, for instance regularly performed at the Proms.

After commenting that the &quot;A minor and E major concertos are beginning to win a place in our concert halls,&quot; Albert Schweitzer writes, in the 1911 English-language edition of his book on Bach:Johannes Umbreit&#x27;s piano reduction of the orchestral score was published by Henle. 

Research by Andreas Glöckner, published in 1982, dispelled prior assumptions that Bach would have composed the concerto in Köthen: Bach&#x27;s extant autograph parts indicate that the concerto was composed in Leipzig, likely in 1730 or the earlier part of 1731. The New Bach Edition published the concerto in 1986, edited by Dietrich Kilian. According to Peter Wollny, writing in 1999, &quot;The &quot;Concerto for two violins in D minor BWV 1043&quot; is today one of the best-known and most frequently performed works of the composer, above all by virtue of its soulful, song-like middle movement.&quot;

According to Michael Miller, writing for Penguin&#x27;s &quot;Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guides&quot;, the concerto is one of Bach&#x27;s eleven most notable compositions. In the &quot;Rough Guides&quot;, the &quot;Double Concerto&quot; is described as &quot;one of Bach&#x27;s very greatest works.&quot; The BBC website describes the concerto as &quot;one of Bach&#x27;s best loved instrumental works.&quot; According to the British Classic FM website, &quot;the &#x27;Bach Double&#x27; is one of the most famous of his works.&quot; The uDiscover Music website lists it among ten essential pieces by the composer.

==Recordings==
Recordings of the concerto include:
==Use in Choreography==
Neoclassical choreographer George Balanchine created the ballet &quot;Concerto Barocco&quot; to the Concerto in D minor for two violins, with two principal female dancers each following one of the instrumental soloists and the corps following the orchestra. 
Modern dance choreographer Paul Taylor used the second and third movements of Bach&#x27;s Concerto in D minor (as well as the entire Violin Concerto in E Major) as the music for Esplanade, a dance &quot;based on pedestrian movement&quot;.

<text>The Portulacaceae are a family of flowering plants, comprising 115 species in a single genus &quot;Portulaca&quot;. Formerly some 20 genera with about 500 species, were placed there, but it is now restricted to encompass only one genus, the other genera being placed elsewhere. The family has been recognised by most taxonomists, and is also known as the purslane family. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the highest diversity in semiarid regions of the Southern Hemisphere in Africa, Australia, and South America, but with a few species also extending north into Arctic regions. The family is very similar to the Caryophyllaceae, differing in the calyx, which has only two sepals.

The APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998) assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. In the APG III system, several genera were moved to the Montiaceae, Didiereaceae, Anacampserotaceae and Talinaceae, thus making the family monotypic and only containing the genus &quot;Portulaca&quot;.

==Uses==
Common purslane (&quot;Portulaca oleracea&quot;) is widely consumed as an edible plant, and in some areas it is invasive. &quot;Portulaca grandiflora&quot; is a well-known ornamental garden plant. Purslanes are relished by chickens. Some &quot;Portulaca&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the nutmeg moth (&quot;Hadula trifolii&quot;).

<text>John Milton (April 20, 1807 – April 1, 1865) was governor of Florida through most of the American Civil War. A lawyer who served in the Florida Legislature, he supported the secession of Florida from the Union and became governor in October 1861. In that post, he turned the state into a major supplier of food for the Confederacy. In his final message to the state legislature as the war was ending, he declared that death would be preferable to reunion with the North. When he killed himself, his son Jefferson Davis Milton was a toddler.

==Early and personal life==
Milton was the son of a prominent Southern family and a relative of the famed English poet of the same name. A lawyer and politician, he was the governor of Florida through much of the Civil War, being a strong supporter of secession, as well as a slave owner.

He was the son of Homer Virgil Milton, an officer who fought in the War of 1812, and the grandson of Revolutionary War hero, United States presidential candidate of 1789, and former Georgia Secretary of State, John Milton. Born near Louisville, Georgia, John Milton married Susan Cobb in about 1830, and they had three children. They lived in Georgia and later in Alabama. He remarried Caroline Howze from Alabama in 1844; they had two sons and seven daughters.

John and Caroline lived in Alabama, New Orleans, and eventually settled in Marianna (northern Florida). One of their sons was Old West lawman Jeff Milton, and a grandson, William Hall Milton, was a United States senator from Florida in 1908 and 1909.

==Career==
During his career, Milton became a lawyer, practicing in a number of communities in Georgia and Alabama, before settling in New Orleans. He came to Florida in 1846, and quickly entered the Florida political scene. In 1848, he served as a presidential elector for the state, then in 1850 was elected to the Florida House of Representatives.

==American Civil War==
As a supporter and practitioner of slavery, he was an early advocate for secession of Florida from the Union. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention from Florida and in the same year ran for the office of governor. A convention was called for to take up the issue of secession and on January 10, 1861, the measure passed. He took the oath of office on October 7, 1861. During the Civil War, Milton stressed the importance of Florida as a supplier of goods, rather than men, with Florida being a large provider of food and salt for the Confederate Army. As the war drew to a close and the Confederacy was close to defeat, he became worn down by the stress of his office. Governor Milton left Tallahassee for his plantation, Sylvania, in Marianna, Florida.

==Death==
In his final message to the state legislature, he said that the Northern Army leaders &quot;have developed a character so odious that death would be preferable to reunion with them&quot;.

On April 1, 1865, his son, William Henry Milton, found the governor dead of a gunshot wound to the head. The president of the Florida Senate, Abraham K. Allison, was sworn in as governor of Florida later that day.

Governor John Milton is buried at Saint Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Cemetery in Marianna.

Like many families of the era, Reconstruction was an economically difficult time for the late governor&#x27;s family in Jackson County, Florida. Milton&#x27;s youngest son, Jefferson Davis Milton (1861–1947) moved to Texas, later Arizona. He distinguished himself as a Texas Ranger, police chief of El Paso, and served for over 25 years as America&#x27;s first border agent. William Hall Milton (1864–1942), grandson of the governor, was a U.S. Senator from Florida from 1908 to 1909.

== Military career ==
Promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Royal Corps of Engineers, Duportail was secretly sent to America in March 1777 to serve in Washington&#x27;s Continental Army under an agreement between Benjamin Franklin and the government of King Louis XVI of France. He was appointed colonel and chief engineer of the Continental Army, July 1777; brigadier general, November 17, 1777; commander, Corps of Engineers, May 1779; and major general, November 16, 1781.

Duportail helped Washington evolve the primarily defensive military strategy that wore down the British Army, and participated in fortifications planning from Boston, Massachusetts to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was captured following the surrender of the city in May 1780. Subsequently exchanged, he also directed the construction of siege works at the Battle of Yorktown, site of the decisive Franco-American victory of the Revolutionary War. During the encampment at Valley Forge in late 1777 and early 1778, his headquarters was at Cressbrook Farm.

Returning to France in October 1783, Duportail became an infantry officer and in 1788 a Maréchal-de-Camp (brigadier general). He served as France&#x27;s minister of war from November 16, 1790, through December 7, 1791, during the beginning of the French Revolution and promoted military reforms. Forced into hiding by radical Jacobins, he escaped to America and bought a farm near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He lived there until 1802, when he died at sea while attempting to return to France.

<text>Andrea Jaeger ( ; born June 4, 1965) is an American former professional tennis player. She started her professional tennis career at the age of 14 and went on to win pro tennis tournaments while still competing in other junior tennis events. By the age of 16, she was the second ranked female professional tennis player in the world. She reached the singles finals at the French Open in 1982 and at Wimbledon in 1983. She also reached the singles semifinals at the Australian Open and the U.S. Open. During her career, she won 10 singles titles. In mixed doubles, she won the French Open with Jimmy Arias in 1981. She reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2.

After sustaining a shoulder injury in 1984, Andrea Jaeger shifted her focus from professional tennis to humanitarian projects she had begun as a teenager. She committed her tennis earnings to developing programs that provide support to children with cancer and those in need. Now in its 39th year, her initiative offers financial assistance and various care services to affected children and their families. Nelson Mandela once visited to recognize the work of her foundation.

==Early life==
Andrea Jaeger was born on June 4, 1965 in Chicago. Her parents are Roland and Ilse Jaeger, are both deceased. Jaeger grew up in Skokie and Lincolnshire, Illinois.

==Tennis career==
While a student at Stevenson High School, Jaeger was the top-ranked player in the United States in the 18-and-under age group. She won 13 U.S. national junior titles, including the most prominent junior titles in tennis: the 1979 Orange Bowl and 1979 Boca Raton.

In 1980 (at the age of 15 years, 19 days), Jaeger became the youngest player ever to be seeded at Wimbledon, a record that was broken by Jennifer Capriati in 1990. After defeating former champion Virginia Wade, she became the youngest quarterfinalist in the history of the tournament. Later in the year, she became the youngest semifinalist in US Open history. By the age of 16, she had become the second ranked female professional tennis player in the world.

Jaeger became a household name on the front pages of news publications, notable magazines and appearances on TV. People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Life Magazine visited her junior high and high school. One of her endorsement commercials featured Jaeger with Bjorn Borg and another with her Mom, highlighting a new way of viewing sports prodigies.

At the French Open in 1982, Jaeger defeated Chris Evert in the semifinal 6–3, 6–1 but lost the final to Martina Navratilova. She then reached the semifinals of both the US Open and the Australian Open, losing both matches to Evert in straight sets. Jaeger and Evert met 10 times in all in 1982, with Jaeger winning three of the first five but losing the last five in a row.

At Wimbledon in 1983, Jaeger defeated six-time Wimbledon singles champion Billie Jean King 6–1, 6–1 in a semifinal on Centre Court, which was King&#x27;s last career singles match at that tournament and her most lopsided singles defeat at Wimbledon. Jaeger then lost the final to Navratilova.

Jaeger won eight of the nine singles matches she played for the U.S. in Fed Cup. She also won two of the three Wightman Cup singles matches she played for the U.S., resulting in the U.S. winning Fed Cup and Wightman Cup trophies.

A major shoulder injury at the age of 19 ended Jaeger&#x27;s career in 1985. Jaeger obtained a degree in theology and ministry training.

During her career, Jaeger won U.S. $1.4 million in prize money and had endorsement deals with clothing, racket, shoes, watch and fast food restaurants.

==Philanthropy==
Jaeger used her winnings from tennis to create the Silver Lining Foundation in 1990. The foundation&#x27;s purpose was to provide long term care to children with cancer and children in need. Originally located in Aspen, Colorado, the organization transported groups of young cancer patients to Aspen for a week of support and activities, including horseback riding and whitewater rafting. The foundation also provided money for programs for children who could not travel. The first contributor was John McEnroe. Many high-profile celebrities were involved, including Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, David Robinson, Cindy Crawford, David Foster and Kevin Costner. The foundation was later renamed ‘Little Star Foundation’, paying tribute to Rhea Olsen, a teenager with cancer from Chicago. Olsen became best friends with Jaeger and became the first-ever paid employee of the Foundation. Jaeger helped Olsen for years before her death.

In 1996, Jaeger received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given annually by Jefferson Awards.

Jaeger&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;First Service&quot;, was published in 2004. In the book, she discussed her teenage years as a tennis player and her focus on serving God. All proceeds from the book were donated to children&#x27;s charities.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and recent hurricanes and other natural disasters Jaeger&#x27;s Foundation provided food, medical, daily, educational and recreational supplies and support to help.

In April 2007, Jaeger and several former athletes, including Andre Agassi, Lance Armstrong, Tony Hawk, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and Muhammad Ali, appeared on the American morning television talk show Good Morning America to announce their formation of a charity called Athletes for Hope.

Jaeger&#x27;s Little Star Foundation has a podcast called Little Star Light. Guests have included David Agus, Jill Bolte Taylor, Christine Brennan, Cindy Crawford, David Foster, Tony Hawk, Judy Jordan, Dallas Jenkins, Samina Khan, Nancy Lieberman, Patrick McEnroe, Anne Drysdale, Joe Moravsky, Brian Sharp, Michael Singer, Leslie Visser, Alice Walker, and Kurt Warner.

<doc id="862802" wikidata="Q639138" url="?curid=862802" title="Ardex (car manufacturer)">
<text>Ardex was a small French automobile manufacturer controlled by Marcel Tamine and based in Nanterre.

In 1934, Ardex produced its first cyclecar, which followed the form of the Morgan three-wheeler and was powered by a V2 500 cc engine. A four-wheel car followed in 1937 which was at the time the cheapest car on the French market, priced at 5,500 francs: 10,900 francs were needed to buy a Simca 5.

In September 1939 France declared war on Germany and in June 1940 the German Army rapidly invaded and occupied Northern France. The war years were characterised by a desperate shortage of raw materials for civilian industry and of petrol. Their experience of producing very small lightweight cyclecars now encouraged Ardex to develop several little cars powered initially by electric batteries and later by pedal power during 1942 and 1943. The first significant order came from the Fulmen Company, then a leading French producer of electrical goods and equipment. The early wartime cyclecars came on four wheels, but the number of the wheels was quickly reduced to three since during 1942 tyres became increasingly hard to find and, where found, hard to afford. In October 1942 the occupying power banned the construction of electric cars, following which Ardex were restricted to pedal powered cyclecars until after the war.

In 1953, Ardex introduced a four-seater microcar. The engine was a Société Anonyme BriBan (S.A.B.B) single cylinder two stroke unit of 100 or 125 cc.

Production ended in 1955.

The Ardex name was then acquired by Max Sardou, a French engineer. He went on to create the Ardex S80, which was entered in the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans as a Group 6 Prototype but failed to qualify. It was powered by the BMW M88 3.5L from the BMW M1 and paired to a Hewland five speed manual transmission.

<doc id="862804" wikidata="Q326301" url="?curid=862804" title="Broiler">
<text>Breed broiler is any chicken (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) that is bred and raised specifically for meat production. Most commercial broilers reach slaughter weight between four and six weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Broiler or sometimes broiler-fryer is also used sometimes to refer specifically to younger chickens under , as compared with the larger roasters.

Due to extensive breeding selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions and congestive heart conditions. Management of ventilation, housing, stocking density and in-house procedures must be evaluated regularly to support good welfare of the flock. The breeding stock (broiler-breeders) do grow to maturity but also have their own welfare concerns related to the frustration of a high feeding motivation and beak trimming. Broilers are usually grown as mixed-sex flocks in large sheds under intensive conditions.

== Modern breeding ==
Before the development of modern commercial meat breeds, broilers were mostly young male chickens culled from farm flocks. Pedigree breeding began around 1916. Magazines for the poultry industry existed at this time. A crossbred variety of chicken was produced from a male of a naturally double-breasted Cornish strain, and a female of a tall, large-boned strain of white Plymouth Rocks. This first attempt at a meat crossbreed was introduced in the 1930s and became dominant in the 1960s. The original crossbreed was plagued by problems of low fertility, slow growth and disease susceptibility.

Modern broilers have become very different from the Cornish/Rock crossbreeds. As an example, Donald Shaver (originally a breeder of egg-production breeds) began gathering breeding stock for a broiler program in 1950. Besides the breeds normally favored, Cornish Game, Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire, Langshans, Jersey Black Giant, and Brahmas were included. A white feathered female line was purchased from Cobb. A full-scale breeding program was commenced in 1958, with commercial shipments in Canada and the US in 1959 and in Europe in 1963. As a second example, color sexing broilers was proposed by Shaver in 1973. The genetics were based on the company&#x27;s breeding plan for egg layers, which had been developed in the mid-1960s. A difficulty facing the breeders of the color-sexed broiler is that the chicken must be white-feathered by slaughter age. After 12 years, accurate color sexing without compromising economic traits was achieved.

=== Artificial insemination ===
Artificial insemination is a mechanism in which spermatozoa are deposited into the reproductive tract of a female. Artificial insemination provides a number of benefits relating to reproduction in the poultry industry. Broiler breeds have been selected specifically for growth, causing them to develop large pectoral muscles, which interfere with and reduce natural mating. The amount of sperm produced and deposited in the hen&#x27;s reproductive tract may be limited because of this. Additionally, the males&#x27; overall sex drive may be significantly reduced due to growth selection. Artificial insemination has allowed many farmers to incorporate selected genes into their stock, increasing their genetic quality.

Abdominal massage is the most common method used for semen collection. During this process, the rooster is restrained and the back region located towards the tail and behind the wings is caressed. This is done gently but quickly. Within a short period of time, the male should get an erection of the phallus. Once this occurs, the cloaca is squeezed and semen is collected from the external papilla of the vas deferens.

During artificial insemination, semen is most frequently deposited intra-vaginally by means of a plastic syringe. In order for semen to be deposited here, the vaginal orifice is everted through the cloaca. This is simply done by applying pressure to the abdomen of the hen. The semen-containing instrument is placed 2–4 cm into the vaginal orifice. As the semen is deposited, the pressure applied to the hen&#x27;s abdomen is released simultaneously. The person performing this procedure typically uses one hand to move and direct the tail feathers, while using the other hand to insert the instrument and semen into the vagina.

== General biology ==
Modern commercial broilers, for example, Cornish crosses and Cornish-Rocks, are artificially selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production. They are noted for having very fast growth rates, a high feed conversion ratio, and low levels of activity. Modern commercial broilers are bred to reach a slaughter-weight of about in only 5 to 7 weeks. As a consequence, the behaviour and physiology of broilers reared for meat are those of immature birds, rather than adults. Slow growing free-range and organic strains have been developed which reach slaughter-weight at 12 to 16 weeks of age.

Typical broilers have white feathers and yellowish skin. Recent genetic analysis has revealed that the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl (&quot;G. sonneratii&quot;). Modern crosses are also favorable for meat production because they lack the typical &quot;hair&quot; which many breeds have that must be removed by singeing after plucking the carcass.

Both male and female broilers are reared for their meat.

=== Behavior ===
Broiler behavior is modified by the environment, and alters as the broilers&#x27; age and bodyweight rapidly increase. For example, the activity of broilers reared outdoors is initially greater than broilers reared indoors, but from six weeks of age, decreases to comparable levels in all groups. The same study shows that in the outdoors group, surprisingly little use is made of the extra space and facilities such as perches – it was proposed that the main reason for this was leg weakness as 80 per cent of the birds had a detectable gait abnormality at seven weeks of age. There is no evidence of reduced motivation to extend the behavioral repertoire, as, for example, ground pecking remained at significantly higher levels in the outdoor groups because this behavior could also be performed from a lying posture rather than standing.

Examining the frequency of all sexual behaviour shows a large decrease with age, suggestive of a decline in libido. The decline in libido is not enough to account for reduced fertility in heavy cocks at 58 weeks and is probably a consequence of the large bulk or the conformation of the males at this age interfering in some way with the transfer of semen during copulations which otherwise look normal.

=== Feeding and feed conversion ===
Chickens are omnivores and modern broilers are given access to a special diet of high protein feed, usually delivered via an automated feeding system. This is combined with artificial lighting conditions to stimulate eating and growth and thus the desired body weight.

In the U.S., the average feed conversion ratio (FCR) of a broiler was 1.91 kilograms of feed per kilograms of liveweight in 2011, an improvement from 4.70 in 1925. Canada has a typical FCR of 1.72. New Zealand commercial broiler farms have recorded the world&#x27;s best broiler chicken FCR at 1.38. The microbiome of the broiler also has a large effect in addition to the birds nutrition and genetics on overall FCR.

== Welfare issues ==

Artificial selection has led to a great increase in the speed with which broilers develop and reach slaughter-weight. Selection and husbandry for very fast growth means there is a genetically induced mismatch between the energy-supplying organs of the broiler and its energy-consuming organs. Rapid growth can lead to metabolic disorders such as sudden death syndrome and ascites. Breeding for increased breast muscle affects the way chickens walk and puts additional stresses on their hips and legs. There is a high frequency of skeletal problems in broilers, mainly in the locomotory system. These leg abnormalities impair the locomotor abilities of the birds, and lame birds spend more time lying and sleeping. Increased inactivity is linked with an increase in dermatitis caused by a greater amount of time in contact with ammonia in poultry litter. Broilers are usually kept at high stocking densities. This can reduce feed intake and growth. Management conditions (litter quality, temperature and humidity) are however more important than stocking density. Many broilers die during the processes of catching, packing and transport.

== World production and consumption ==
The commercial production of broiler chickens for meat consumption is a highly industrialized process. There are two major sectors: (1) rearing birds intended for consumption and (2) rearing parent stock for breeding the meat birds. A report in 2005 stated that around 5.9 billion broiler chickens for eating were produced yearly in the European Union. Mass production of chicken meat is a global industry and at that time, only two or three breeding companies supplied around 90% of the world&#x27;s breeder-broilers. The total number of meat chickens produced in the world was nearly 47 billion in 2004; of these, approximately 19% were produced in the US, 15% in China, 13% in the EU25 and 11% in Brazil.

Consumption of broilers is surpassing that of beef in industrialized countries, with demand rising in Asia. Worldwide, 86.6 million tonnes of broiler meat were produced in 2014, and , the worldwide estimation of broiler chick population was approximately 23 billion.

<text>Magic Johnson Enterprises is an investment company founded by Basketball Hall of Famer and entrepreneur Magic Johnson. The company was founded in 1987 and is based in Beverly Hills, California. 

Magic Johnson Enterprises formerly owned Magic Johnson Theatres and 24-Hour Fitness/Magic Johnson Sport health clubs. Over the years, Magic Johnson Enterprises has continually invested ownership in many lucrative businesses such as the Los Angeles Lakers, movie theaters and restaurants in the United States, including T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s, Sodexo, and Burger King locations.

== Investments ==
In 1995, Johnson took an equity stake along with what was then the Loews chain in the 12-screen multiplex movie theater in Baldwin Hills (now owned by Cinemark).

The company teamed up with Starbucks in 1998, acquiring around 125 stores and in October 2010 sold 105 of the stores in a $100 million deal.

In March 2008, Johnson signed a multi-year marketing deal to help electronics retailer Best Buy Co. bolster sales in urban neighborhoods. 

In October 2010, he sold his 4% interest in the Los Angeles Lakers for an estimated $27 million to Patrick Soon-Shiong.

In 2006, the company made headlines for concluding a deal with Sodexo, one of the largest food services and facilities management companies in the world. The initiative includes a marketing agreement and the formation of SodexoMAGIC, LLC, a new joint venture that is 51 percent owned by Johnson.

In June 2015, the company announced it had acquired a controlling interest in EquiTrust Life Insurance Co.

== Sports teams ==
Co-ownership of the LA Dodgers was purchased by Magic Johnson Enterprises in 2012 for a reported $2 billion.

In 2014, Johnson led the purchase of WNBA team, Los Angeles Sparks with Guggenheim Partners. The same year, he became part owner of MLS team, Los Angeles FC.

In 2023, Magic Johnson Enterprises, along with a group of others, purchased the Washington DC–based NFL team Washington Commanders for $6.05 billion.

In September 2024, Johnson invested in Washington DC–based National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) club, Washington Spirit.

== Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund ==
Johnson&#x27;s urban investments were formed in 2001 as the Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund, an alliance with Canyon Capital. The alliance has financed 31 real estate developments in 13 states and the District Of Columbia. The first Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund struggled for two years to raise $300 million to invest in urban neighborhoods. A subsequent fund raised $600 million while the third and biggest investment fund was started in April 2008 and drew $1 billion from pension funds and other investors. The Canyon-Johnson fund was involved in the $100-million purchase of the 32-story former Transamerica Center complex in downtown Los Angeles that subsequently was renovated and sold for $205 million. The fund also had a stake in Sunset+Vine in Hollywood, which was built for $125 million and sold for $160 million.

<doc id="862821" wikidata="Q2448110" url="?curid=862821" title="Chalk Group">
<text>The Chalk Group (often just called the Chalk) is the lithostratigraphic unit (a certain number of rock strata) which contains the Upper Cretaceous limestone succession in southern and eastern England. The same or similar rock sequences occur across the wider northwest European chalk &#x27;province&#x27;. It is characterised by thick deposits of chalk, a soft porous white limestone, deposited in a marine environment.

Chalk is a limestone that consists of coccolith biomicrite. A biomicrite is a limestone composed of fossil debris (&quot;bio&quot;) and calcium carbonate mud (&quot;micrite&quot;). Most of the fossil debris in chalk consists of the microscopic plates, which are called coccoliths, of microscopic green algae known as coccolithophores. In addition to the coccoliths, the fossil debris includes a variable, but minor, percentage of the fragments of foraminifera, ostracods and mollusks. The coccolithophores lived in the upper part of the water column. When they died, the microscopic calcium carbonate plates, which formed their shells settled downward through the ocean water and accumulated on the ocean bottom to form a thick layer of calcareous ooze, which eventually became the Chalk Group.

The Chalk Group usually shows few signs of bedding, other than lines of flint nodules which become common in the upper part. Nodules of the mineral pyrite also occur and are usually oxidized to brown iron oxide on exposed surfaces.

Well-known outcrops include the White Cliffs of Dover, Beachy Head, the southern coastal cliffs of the Isle of Wight, Flamborough Head East Yorkshire, the quarries and motorway cuttings at Blue Bell Hill, Kent, (which has been classified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest) and at the Stokenchurch Gap on the Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire border where the M40 motorway cuts through the Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve.


==Subdivisions==
The Chalk Group is now divided into a &quot;White Chalk Subgroup&quot; and a &quot;Grey Chalk Subgroup&quot;, both of which are further subdivided into formations. These modern divisions replace numerous earlier divisions, references to which occur widely on geological maps and in other geological literature. Previously no subgroups were defined but three formations were identified; the Upper Chalk, Middle Chalk and Lower Chalk. Different formations are defined within the &#x27;northern&#x27; and &#x27;southern&#x27; provinces, from Norfolk northwards and south of the Thames valley respectively. A &#x27;transitional province&#x27; between the two and covering much of East Anglia and the Chiltern Hills is also recognised. A different approach again is taken as regards the succession beneath the North Sea.

===Grey Chalk Subgroup===

The Grey Chalk Subgroup (formerly the Lower Chalk minus the Plenus Marls) is usually relatively soft and greyish in colour. It is also the most fossiliferous (especially for ammonite fossils). The strata of this subgroup usually begin with the &#x27;Glauconitic Marl Member&#x27; (formerly known as the Glauconitic or Chloritic Marl), named after the grains of the green minerals glauconite and chlorite which it contains. The remainder of the subgroup is argillaceous in its lower part (the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation (formerly the &#x27;Chalk Marl&#x27;) and becomes progressively purer in the &#x27;Zig-zag Chalk Formation&#x27; (the former &#x27;Grey Chalk&#x27;). In the central Chilterns the two parts are separated by the hard Totternhoe Stone, which forms a prominent scarp in some places. There are few, if any, flint nodules present.

These two formations are not recognised within the northern province i.e. the outcrop north from East Anglia to Yorkshire, where the entire sequence is now referred to as the &#x27;Ferriby Chalk Formation&#x27;. The thickness of the Grey Chalk Subgroup strata varies, averaging around , depending upon the location. They often contains fossils such as the ammonites &quot;Schloenbachia&quot;, &quot;Scaphites&quot;, and &quot;Mantelliceras&quot;, the belemnite &quot;Actinocamax&quot;, and the bivalves &quot;Inoceramus&quot; and &quot;Ostrea&quot;.
===White Chalk Subgroup===
The White Chalk Subgroup includes what were formerly designated the Middle Chalk and Upper Chalk Formations, together with the Plenus Marls (topmost part of the former Lower Chalk Formation). In the southern province it is divided in the following way (youngest/uppermost at top):
* Portsdown Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27; and the equivalent of Rowe Chalk Formation, below)
* Culver Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
** Spetisbury Chalk Member (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
** Tarrant Chalk Member (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* Newhaven Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* Seaford Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* New Pit Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Middle Chalk&#x27;)
* Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Middle Chalk&#x27;)
** Plenus Marls Member

In the northern province the sequence is divided thus:
* Rowe Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27; and the equivalent of Portsdown Chalk Formation, above)
* Flamborough Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* Burnham Chalk Formation (formerly part of &#x27;Upper Chalk&#x27;)
* Welton Chalk Formation (formerly &#x27;Middle Chalk&#x27;)
** Plenus Marls Member

In the southern province, the former Middle Chalk, now the Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation and overlying New Pit Formation, averages about in thickness. The sparse fossils found in this sequence include the brachiopod &quot;Terebratulina&quot; and the echinoid &quot;Conulus&quot;.

The former Upper Chalk by comparison is softer than the underlying sequence and the flint nodules it contains are far more abundant in the South of England, although in Yorkshire the underlying strata have the highest concentration of flints. It may contain ammonite and gastropod fossils in some nodular layers. The thickness of this sequence varies greatly, often averaging around . Fossils may be abundant and include the bivalve &quot;Spondylus&quot;, the brachiopods &quot;Terebratulina&quot; and &quot;Gibbithyris&quot;, the echinoids &quot;Sternotaxis&quot;, &quot;Micraster&quot;, &quot;Echinocorys&quot;, and &quot;Tylocidaris&quot;, the crinoid &quot;Marsupites&quot;, and the small sponge &quot;Porosphaera&quot;. A possible azhdarchoid pterosaur is known from Coniacian-aged rocks that form part of the Upper Chalk, making it the youngest known pterosaur discovered to date in England.

The youngest beds of the sequence are found on the coast of Norfolk. Other fossils commonly found in this formation include: solitary corals (such as &quot;Parasmilia&quot;), marine worm tubes (such as &quot;Rotularia&quot;), bryozoans, scattered fragments of starfish and fish remains (including shark teeth such as &quot;Cretolamna&quot; and &quot;Squalicorax&quot;).

== Chalk landscapes of England ==

The Chalk outcrops across large parts of southern and eastern England and forms a significant number of the major physiographical features. Whilst it has been postulated that a chalk cover was laid down across just about all of England and Wales during Cretaceous times, subsequent uplift and erosion has resulted in it remaining only southeast of a line drawn roughly between The Wash and Lyme Bay in Dorset and eastwards from the scarps of the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds. Gentle folding of the Mesozoic rocks of this region during the Alpine orogeny has produced the London Basin and the Weald–Artois Anticline, the Hampshire Basin and the less gentle Purbeck-Wight monocline.

The broadly western margin of the Chalk outcrop is marked, from northeast to southwest, to south by the Chalk downlands of the Yorkshire Wolds, the Lincolnshire Wolds, a subdued feature through western Norfolk, including Breckland, the Chiltern Hills, the Berkshire Downs, Marlborough Downs and the western margins of Salisbury Plain and Cranborne Chase and the North and South Dorset Downs. In parts of the Thames Basin and eastern East Anglia the Chalk is concealed by later deposits, as is the case too within the Hampshire Basin.

Only where the Weald–Artois Anticline has been &#x27;unroofed&#x27; by erosion i.e. within the Weald is the Chalk entirely absent. In this area the long north-facing scarp of the South Downs and the longer south-facing scarp of the North Downs face one another across the Weald. For similar reasons, the Chalk is largely absent from the rather smaller area to the south of the Purbeck-Wight Monocline, save for the downs immediately north of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight.

Some of the best exposures of the Chalk are where these ranges intersect the coast to produce dramatic, often vertical cliffs as at Flamborough Head, the White Cliffs of Dover, Seven Sisters, Old Harry Rocks (Purbeck) and The Needles on the Isle of Wight. The Chalk, which once extended across the English Channel, gives rise to similar cliff features on the French coast.

==Offshore and elsewhere==

===Northern Ireland===
In the &#x27;Ulster Cretaceous Province&#x27; of Northern Ireland the clastic-dominated Hibernian Greensands Group and the overlying Ulster White Limestone Group are the stratigraphical equivalents of the Chalk Group of England. They are best exposed near the Antrim coast.

===Scotland===
In the &#x27;Scottish Chalk Province&#x27; (extending from Mull to Skye) the Inner Hebrides Group is the stratigraphical equivalent of England&#x27;s Chalk Group. It comprises largely sandstones and mudstones though the Santonian age Gribun Chalk Formation of Mull and nearby Morvern is recognised.

===The Low Countries===
The Dutch () and Belgian () equivalents of the Chalk Group are basically continuous and crop out as a slightly northwest dipping monocline in a belt from the German city of Aachen to the city of Mons, where they join Cretaceous deposits of the Paris Basin. North of Namur the Cretaceous is overlain by younger Paleocene and Eocene deposits of the Landen Group.

In the Low Countries, the Chalk Group succession is divided into five formations, from top to base:
*the Houthem Formation, consisting of Paleocene calcareous arenites;
*the Maastricht Formation, consisting of Maastrichtian chalk and calcareous arenites;
*the Gulpen Formation, consisting of Campanian to Maastrichtian chalk;
*the Vaals Formation, consisting of alternating Campanian clays, glauconiferous sands and silts;
*the Aachen Formation, consisting of Santonian glauconiferous sands and silts.
In Belgium, the Houthem Formation is sometimes not included in the Chalk Group because it is not a Cretaceous formation. Some stratigraphers therefore prefer to put it in the lower Paleogene Hesbaye Group.

===The English Channel===
The Channel Tunnel linking England and France was constructed by tunnelling through the West Melbury Marly Chalk (formerly the &#x27;Chalk Marl&#x27; - a prominent sub-unit of the Grey Chalk Subgroup).

===The North Sea===

The chalk is also an important petroleum reservoir in the North Sea Central Graben, mainly in Norwegian and Danish sectors and to a lesser extent in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf sector (UKCS).

Across the north central and northern North Sea, the Chalk Group is a major seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards. North of the line of the Mid-North Sea - Ringkobing - Fyn structural high, the Chalk Group is still recognisable in drilled samples, but becomes increasingly muddy northwards. North of the Beryl Embayment (59°30&#x27; N 01°30&#x27;E), the Chalk Group is a series of slightly to moderately calcareous mudstones grouped under the name of the Shetland Group. With the exception of some thin sandy units in the inner Moray Firth, this sequence has neither source potential nor reservoir capacity and is not generally considered a drilling target. Its thickness and homogeneity does make it a common target for carrying out directional drilling manoeuvers.

In the Shearwater and Eastern Trough Area Project areas (around 56°30&#x27; N 02°30&#x27;E, UKCS quadrants 22,23,29 and 30), the Chalk Group can be significantly overpressured. Further south in UKCS quadrant 30 and Norwegian quadrants 1 and 2, this overpressure helps preserve porosity and enables the Chalk to be an effective reservoir.

===Reservoir stratigraphy===

*Chalk Unit 6 - Ekofisk Formation - Danian age (major reservoir in the Ekofisk oil field and others)
*Chalk Unit 5 - Tor Formation - Maastrichtian age, (major reservoir in many fields including Joanne oil field (UKCS), Valhall oil field (NCS))
*Chalk Unit 4 - Hod Formation - Late Campanian age (mostly non reservoir)
*Chalk Unit 3 - Hod Formation - Santonian to Middle Campanian
*Chalk Unit 2 - Hod Formation - Middle Turonian to Coniacian
*Turonian shale - Early Turonian (non reservoir)
*Plenus Marl - Late Cenomanian (non reservoir)
*Chalk Unit 1 - Hidra Formation - Cenomanian (non reservoir)

===Reservoir geology===
The majority of Chalk reservoirs are redeposited allochthonous beds. These include debris flows and turbidite flows. Porosities can be very high when preserved from diagenesis by early hydrocarbon charge. However, when these hydrocarbons are produced, diagenesis and compaction can restart which has led to several metres of subsidence at seabed, the collapse of a number of wells, and some &quot;extremely&quot; expensive remedial work to lift the platforms and re-position them.

== Fossils ==
Fossils of the echinoid &quot;Micraster&quot; from the Chalk Group have been studied for their continuous morphogical variation throughout the record. Mosasaur remains referred to &quot;&quot;Mosasaurus&quot; &quot;gracillis&quot; from the Turonian aged Chalk Group deposits actually are more closely allied to the Russellosaurina. A single partial maxillar tooth from Cenomanian aged Chalk Group described as &quot;Iguanodon hilli&quot;&quot; belongs to a non-Hadrosaurid Hadrosauroid.

<text>is a town located in Chiba Prefecture, Japan., the town had an estimated population of 20,660 in 9,888 households and a population density of 1,100 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Etymology==
The name of Shisui in the Japanese language is formed from three kanji characters. The first, , means &quot;sake&quot;, The second, , is an ideographic iteration mark, indicating a repetition of the first character, and the third, means &quot;well&quot;. The area in present-day Shisui was noted for its freshwater springs, and a local legend arose that pure sake gushed freely from the ground, creating &quot;wells of sake&quot;.

==Geography==
Shisui is located on the Shimōsa Plateau in northeastern Chiba Prefecture, about 20 kilometers from the prefectural capital at Chiba and within 40 to 50 kilometers from the center of Tokyo. The town overlooks the Inba Marsh. The town sits on relatively flat, even ground. The south of Shisui is crossed by three small rivers: the Takazaki, Egawa, and Nakagawa, all of which empty into the Inba Marsh.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Shisui increased rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, but has remained steady over the past 30 years.

==History==
The area around Shisui has been inhabited since at least the Japanese Paleolithic, and archaeologists have found stone tools and the foundations of houses dating 24,000 years ago. During the Muromachi period, the area was under control of the Chiba clan. After the start of the Edo period, much of the area of Shisui was part of Sakura Domain, a feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration, Shisui Town was founded on April 1, 1889 within Inba District of Chiba Prefecture with the creation of the modern municipalities system. Proposals to merge Shisui with the neighboring city of Sakura failed to pass a public referendum in 2002.

==Government==
Shisui has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Together with the city of Sakura, Shisui contributes three members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Chiba 13th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Shisui was historically a center of rice and &quot;sake&quot; production. The town is located directly south of Narita International Airport. The central part of the town was developed as a regional commercial center beginning in 1975 due to the construction and expansion of the airport.

==Education==
Shisui has two public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. The town does not have a public high school, but has one private high school.

<text>was a village located in Inba District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

Motono Village was created on April 1, 1914, through the merger of Hongo and Yawara Villages. The development of Chiba New Town greatly accelerated the development of the village, which became a bedroom community for Chiba.

As of February 2011, the village had an estimated population of 9,055 and a density of 382 persons per km2. The total area was 23.72 km2.

On March 23, 2010, Motono, along with the village of Inba (also from Inba District), was merged into the expanded city of Inzai.

<text>Bartolomeus Jozef Lodewijk Rosalia &quot;Bart&quot; Somers (born 12 May 1964 in Mechelen) is a Belgian, Flemish politician. He is currently the mayor of Mechelen. 

In 2017, Bart Somers was awarded 2016 World Mayor Prize as recognition for his outstanding achievements in welcoming refugees during recent years and for the long-term integration of immigrants from different cultures, religions and social backgrounds. He obtained a law degree from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

== Political career ==
Bart Somers is the son of the former People&#x27;s Union parliamentarian, Joos Somers, who was notably a deputy and a senator. After a law degree at KU Leuven, Bart Somers went through the Volksunie before joining the Open VLD in 1992.

Between 2003 and 2004, he was the Minister-President of Flanders.

After the regional elections of June 2004 he was appointed the interim chairman of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD). On 4 December 2004, he was elected with just over 50 percent of the vote to a full term as chairman.

Bart Somers was one of the three negotiators for the Open VLD during the 2007 Belgian government formation.

After his party&#x27;s defeat in the regional elections of 2009, he resigned as chairman of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats.

In June 2016, the European Committee of the Regions adopted Bart Somers report on &quot;Combatting Radicalisation and Violent Extremism: Prevention mechanisms at local and regional level&quot;. His opinion won cross-party support for its calls for more effective policing, for more cooperation between local, regional, national and European authorities, and for an approach based on respect for core principles.

In October 2016, Bart Somers was elected as Leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Committee of the Regions.

In February 2017, he received the &quot;World Mayor Prize 2016&quot;, an election for the year&#x27;s best mayor in the world.

<doc id="862851" wikidata="Q1802419" url="?curid=862851" title="State government">
<text>A state government is the government that controls a subdivision of a country in a federal form of government, which shares political power with the federal or national government. A state government may have some level of political autonomy, or be subject to the direct control of the federal government. This relationship may be defined by a constitution.

The reference to &quot;state&quot; denotes country subdivisions that are officially or widely known as &quot;states&quot;, and should not be confused with a &quot;sovereign state&quot;. Most federations designate their federal units &quot;state&quot; or the equivalent term in the local language; however, in some federations, other designations are used such as Oblast or Republic. Some federations are asymmetric, designating greater powers to some federal units than others.

Provinces are usually divisions of unitary states but occasionally the designation is also given to the federal units such as the Provinces of Argentina or Canada. Their governments, which are also &quot;provincial governments&quot;, are not the subject of this article. Many people confuse the state with city governments, and while a small ticket or small crime will be overlooked by the federal government and handled by the state or city government, that are not the same.

==Australia==

The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal nation with six states (and two mainland territories). Section 51 of the Australian Constitution sets out the division of legislative power between the states and the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Commonwealth government is given a variety of legislative powers, including control of foreign policy, taxation (although this cannot discriminate between states or parts of states), and regulation of interstate commerce and corporations. Since the original ratification of the constitution, the High Court of Australia has settled a number of disputes concerning the extent of the Commonwealth&#x27;s legislative powers, some of which have been controversial and extensively criticised; these included a dispute in 1982 over whether the Commonwealth was entitled to designate land for national heritage purposes under United Nations agreements, as well as numerous disputes over the extent of the Commonwealth&#x27;s power over trade union and industrial relations legislation.

One difference between the Australian and United States models of federalism is that, in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has explicit constitutional power over marriage legislation; this has been a focal point for recent controversies over same-sex marriage.

===Government structure===
Each state of Australia has a governor, who represents the King of Australia (currently Charles III) and performs the ceremonial duties of a head of state. Unlike the Canadian lieutenant-governors, a state governor is appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the state government, not the federal government. Every state also has a parliament; most states have a bicameral parliament, except for Queensland, where the upper chamber (the Legislative Council) was abolished in 1922. Like their Indian counterparts, Australian states have a Westminster system of parliamentary government; the head of government, known in each state as a Premier, is drawn from the state parliament.

==Austria==

In Austria, a &quot;Landtag&quot; (state parliament) elects a &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;, who is not only the chairman of a state government but also the representative of the federal government and responsible for the enforcement of federal legislation.

==Germany==
Germany has sixteen federal states (&quot;Bundesländer&quot;) with their own governments.

== India ==

In India, state governments are the governments ruling over the country&#x27;s 28 states and two of its eight union territories (Delhi and Puducherry). Under the Constitution of India, the executive power of a state is vested in its Governor; however, the real executive power rests with a Council of Ministers, headed by a Chief Minister. The legislative structure consists of a directly-elected legislative assembly and, in the case of 6 states, an indirectly-elected legislative council. The judicial setup consists of the state&#x27;s high court and the district courts subordinate to it.

==Mexico==

Mexico also has states.

== Nigeria==

In Nigeria, States are constituent political entities of which there are currently 36. States have an elected Governor and legislature and broad powers in some areas. Powers not given to the states belong to the federal government under the Constitution of Nigeria.

==Pakistan==

In Pakistan, the Provinces of Pakistan are the federal units. There are currently four.

The Provincial Governments are each headed formally by a Provincial Governor but for practical purposes power is exercised by the Chief Minister, in a parliamentary system similar to that of the Federal government of Pakistan .

==South Africa==

South Africa is usually considered a unitary state but its government system possesses a strong similarity to a federal one. The Constitution of South Africa does not describe the state as federal or unitary.

South Africa is divided into nine provinces which have their own elected governments. Chapter Six of the Constitution of South Africa describes the division of power between the national government and the provincial governments, listing those &quot;functional areas&quot; of government that are exclusively reserved to the provincial governments and those where both levels of government have concurrent powers; the remaining areas not listed are reserved to the national government. In areas where both levels have concurrent powers there is a complex set of rules in the event of a conflict between national and provincial legislation. Generally in such a case the provincial legislation prevails, but national legislation may prescribe standards and frameworks for provinces to follow, and may prevent provinces from adversely affecting national interests or the interests of other provinces. The functional areas in which the provincial governments have powers include agriculture, arts and culture, primary and secondary education, the environment and tourism, health, housing, roads and transport, and social welfare.

The provincial governments are structured according to a parliamentary system in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. The unicameral provincial legislature is elected by party-list proportional representation, and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as Premier to head the executive. The Premier appoints an Executive Council (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various departments of the provincial administration.

==United States==

The United States is divided into 50 states, which comprise the federated polities. Unlike many other federal systems, the states of the U.S. created the federal government. Under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, all governmental powers not granted to the Federal government of the United States nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, making the United States a decentralized federation. Federal law generally takes preference over State law when the two conflict, due to a number of constitutional clauses and judicial precedents. 

In most states, governors are the directly elected head of state and commander-in-chief of their state&#x27;s respective military structure. State legislatures exercise legislative authority. In 49 states out of 50 as well as three of the inhabited Territories of the United States (Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa), the legislature is bicameral, and the houses are commonly, though not exclusively, styled House of Representatives and Senate, although the name of the legislative body as a whole varies between the states (the most common are General Assembly (itself sometimes a term for the lower house of a state legislature) such as in North Carolina, or simply Legislature as in Texas). In Nebraska, United States Virgin Islands and Guam (the latter two being federal territories rather than states) the legislature is unicameral. 
The states are sovereign entities in their own right and maintain much control over their internal affairs with issues such as public transport and law enforcement generally being the domain of state governments (although the Federal government often works with states in these areas). Large portions of the welfare state in the United States are administered by the states as well, which means that levels of social services vary from state to state. This has sometimes been controversial, such as in the case of Medicaid expansion. 
There are also several territories, the most notable of which is Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is treated in a manner similar to a state in many areas, but in others is quite different. Most notably, it does not have representation in the United States Congress other than its non-voting Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico. However, it does enjoy more autonomy in taxation and some other areas than the states, and thus is commonly classified as a sort of autonomous region for the Puerto Rican people, who are culturally distinct from the Americans on the mainland. There exists a debate as to the future status of the territory, with proposals including full statehood, maintenance of the autonomous territory status, or some form of independence (either retaining limited reliance upon the United States or full independence with no special relationship).

<text>French America (), sometimes called Franco-America, in contrast to Anglo-America, is the French-speaking community of people and their diaspora, notably those tracing back origins to New France, the early French colonization of the Americas. The Canadian province of Quebec is the centre of the community and is the point of origin of most of French America. It also includes communities in all provinces of Canada (especially in New Brunswick, where francophones are roughly one third of the population), Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy, Martinique, Guadeloupe (all are parts of France), Saint Lucia and Haiti in the Caribbean; French Guiana (overseas region of France) in South America. Also there are minorities of French speakers in part of the United States (New England, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, California, Illinois and New York), the Dominican Republic, Dominica, Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago.

The Ordre des francophones d&#x27;Amérique is a decoration given in the name of the community to its members. It can also be described as the Francophonie of the Americas.

Because French is a Romance language, French America is sometimes considered to be part of Latin America, but this term more often refers to Hispanic America and Portuguese America, or simply the Americas south of the United States.

<text>In chemistry, hypochlorite, or chloroxide is an oxyanion with the chemical formula ClO−. It combines with a number of cations to form hypochlorite salts. Common examples include sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) and calcium hypochlorite (a component of bleaching powder, swimming pool &quot;chlorine&quot;). The Cl-O distance in ClO− is 1.69 Å.

The name can also refer to esters of hypochlorous acid, namely organic compounds with a ClO– group covalently bound to the rest of the molecule. The principal example is &quot;tert&quot;-butyl hypochlorite, which is a useful chlorinating agent.

Most hypochlorite salts are handled as aqueous solutions. Their primary applications are as bleaching, disinfection, and water treatment agents. They are also used in chemistry for chlorination and oxidation reactions.

==Reactions==

===Acid reaction===
Acidification of hypochlorites generates hypochlorous acid, which exists in an equilibrium with chlorine. A lowered pH (i.e. towards acid) drives the following reaction to the right, liberating chlorine gas, which can be dangerous:

:2  + + + 

===Stability===
Hypochlorites are generally unstable and many compounds exist only in solution. Lithium hypochlorite LiOCl, calcium hypochlorite Ca(OCl)2 and barium hypochlorite Ba(ClO)2 have been isolated as pure anhydrous compounds. All are solids. A few more can be produced as aqueous solutions. In general the greater the dilution the greater their stability. It is not possible to determine trends for the alkaline earth metal salts, as many of them cannot be formed. Beryllium hypochlorite is unheard of. Pure magnesium hypochlorite cannot be prepared; however, solid Mg(OH)OCl is known. Calcium hypochlorite is produced on an industrial scale and has good stability. Strontium hypochlorite, Sr(OCl)2, is not well characterised and its stability has not yet been determined.

Upon heating, hypochlorite degrades to a mixture of chloride, oxygen, and chlorates:

:2  → 2  + 
:3  → 2  + 

This reaction is exothermic and in the case of concentrated hypochlorites, such as LiOCl and Ca(OCl)2, can lead to dangerous thermal runaway and is potentially explosive.

The alkali metal hypochlorites decrease in stability down the group. Anhydrous lithium hypochlorite is stable at room temperature; however, sodium hypochlorite is explosive as an anhydrous solid. The pentahydrate NaOCl·5H2O is unstable above 0 °C, although the more dilute solutions encountered as household bleach are more stable. Potassium hypochlorite (KOCl) is known only in solution.

Lanthanide hypochlorites are also unstable; however, they have been reported as being more stable in their anhydrous forms than in the presence of water. Hypochlorite has been used to oxidise cerium from its +3 to +4 oxidation state.

Hypochlorous acid itself is not stable in isolation as it decomposes to form chlorine. Its decomposition also results in some form of oxygen.

===Reactions with ammonia===
Hypochlorites react with ammonia first giving monochloramine (), then dichloramine (), and finally nitrogen trichloride ().

: + → + Cl

: Cl + → + 

==Preparation==

===Hypochlorite salts===
Hypochlorite salts are formed by the reaction between chlorine and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides. The reaction is performed at close to room temperature to suppress the formation of chlorates. This process is widely used for the industrial production of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)2).
:Cl2 + 2 NaOH → NaCl + NaClO + H2O

:2 Cl2 + 2 Ca(OH)2 → CaCl2 + Ca(ClO)2 + 2 H2O

Large amounts of sodium hypochlorite are also produced electrochemically via an un-separated chloralkali process. In this process brine is electrolyzed to form which dissociates in water to form hypochlorite. This reaction must be conducted in non-acidic conditions to prevent release of chlorine:
:2  → + 2 e−

Some hypochlorites may also be obtained by a salt metathesis reaction between calcium hypochlorite and various metal sulfates. This reaction is performed in water and relies on the formation of insoluble calcium sulfate, which will precipitate out of solution, driving the reaction to completion.
: Ca(ClO)2 + MSO4 → M(ClO)2 + CaSO4

===Organic hypochlorites===

Hypochlorite esters are in general formed from the corresponding alcohols, by treatment with any of a number of reagents (e.g. chlorine, hypochlorous acid, dichlorine monoxide and various acidified hypochlorite salts).

==Biochemistry==
===Biosynthesis of organochlorine compounds===
Chloroperoxidases are enzymes that catalyze the chlorination of organic compounds. This enzyme combines the inorganic substrates chloride and hydrogen peroxide to produce the equivalent of Cl+, which replaces a proton in hydrocarbon substrate:
:R-H + Cl− + H2O2 + H+ → R-Cl + 2 H2O
The source of Cl+ is hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Many organochlorine compounds are biosynthesized in this way.

===Immune response===
In response to infection, the human immune system generates minute quantities of hypochlorite within special white blood cells, called neutrophil granulocytes. These granulocytes engulf viruses and bacteria in an intracellular vacuole called the phagosome, where they are digested.

Part of the digestion mechanism involves an enzyme-mediated respiratory burst, which produces reactive oxygen-derived compounds, including superoxide (which is produced by NADPH oxidase). Superoxide decays to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is used in a myeloperoxidase-catalysed reaction to convert chloride to hypochlorite.

Low concentrations of hypochlorite were also found to interact with a microbe&#x27;s heat shock proteins, stimulating their role as intra-cellular chaperone and causing the bacteria to form into clumps that will eventually die off. The same study found that low (micromolar) hypochlorite levels induce &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; to activate a protective mechanism, although its implications were not clear.

In some cases, the base acidity of hypochlorite compromises a bacterium&#x27;s lipid membrane.

==Industrial and domestic uses==
Hypochlorites, especially of sodium (&quot;liquid bleach&quot;, &quot;Javel water&quot;) and calcium (&quot;bleaching powder&quot;) are widely used, industrially and domestically, to whiten clothes, lighten hair color and remove stains. They were the first commercial bleaching products, developed soon after that property was discovered in 1785 by French chemist Claude Berthollet.

Hypochlorites are widely used as broad spectrum disinfectants and deodorizers. That application started soon after French chemist Labarraque discovered those properties, around 1820 (still before Pasteur formulated his germ theory of disease).

==Laboratory uses==

===As oxidizing agents===
Hypochlorite is the strongest oxidizing agent of the chlorine oxyanions. This can be seen by comparing the standard half cell potentials across the series; the data also shows that the chlorine oxyanions are stronger oxidizers in acidic conditions.

Hypochlorite is a sufficiently strong oxidiser to convert Mn(III) to Mn(V) during the Jacobsen epoxidation reaction and to convert to .
This oxidising power is what makes them effective bleaching agents and disinfectants.

In organic chemistry, hypochlorites can be used to oxidise primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

===As chlorinating agents===
Hypochlorite salts can also serve as chlorinating agents. For example, they convert phenols to chlorophenols. Calcium hypochlorite converts piperidine to &quot;N&quot;-chloropiperidine.

==Related oxyanions==
Chlorine can be the nucleus of oxyanions with oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Chlorine can also assume oxidation state +4 as seen in the neutral compound chlorine dioxide ClO2.

<text>Private John Cunningham VC (28 June 1897 – 21 February 1941) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. John was born in Swains Yard off Manley Street, Scunthorpe and was the eldest son of Charles and Mary Cunningham.

Cunningham was 19 years old, and a private in the 12th (Service) Battalion (the &#x27;Hull Sportsmen&#x27;), a Pals battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment in 31st Division during World War I, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 November 1916, the opening day of the Battle of the Ancre (the final offensive of the Battle of the Somme), attacking from opposite Hebuterne the 31st Division was to seize the German trenches and form a defensive flank north of Serre. After the enemy&#x27;s front line had been captured, Private Cunningham went with a bombing section up a communication trench where much opposition was met and all the rest of the section were either killed or wounded. Collecting all the bombs from the casualties Private Cunningham went on alone and when he had used up all the bombs he had he returned for a fresh supply and again went up the communication trench where he met a party of 10 Germans. He killed all 10 and cleared the trench up to the new line.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at York Army Museum, England.

John was married to Eva Harrison in June 1917 at Hull and had two children, Annie who died in infancy and John who was born in 1920 at Hull. John Cunningham died 20 February 1941 at 5 Beaufort Terrace Campbell Street Hull aged 43 years and his funeral took place in Hull on 24 February 1941, John is buried in grave No: 17509, compartment No; 180 at the Western Cemetery, Kingston upon Hull.

<text>was a town located in Katori District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

== History ==
During the Edo period, the area of present-day Shimofusa was part of Takaoka Domain, a minor feudal domain of the Tokugawa shogunate. Modern Namekawa Village was established on April 1, 1889. On February 11, 1955, it merged with the villages of Takaoka and Komikado to form the town of Shimofusa.

On March 27, 2006, Shimofusa, along with the town of Taiei (also from Katori District), was merged into the expanded city of Narita, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

== Population ==
In February 2006, the last data available before its merger into Narita, the town had an estimated population of 7,868 and a population density of . Its total area was .

==Education==

Shimofusa High School (千葉県立下総高等学校) is located in the former town.

<text>A reefer ship is a refrigerated cargo ship typically used to transport perishable cargo, which require temperature-controlled handling, such as fruits, meat, vegetables, dairy products, and similar items.

== Description ==
&quot;Types of reefers:&quot; Reefer ships may be categorised into three types:
# Side-door vessels have water-tight ports on the ship&#x27;s hull, which open into a cargo hold. Elevators or ramps leading from the quay serve as loading and discharging access for the forklifts or conveyors. Inside these access ports or side doors, pallet lifts or another series of conveyors bring the cargo to the respective decks. This special design makes the vessels particularly well suited for inclement weather operations as the tops of the cargo holds are always closed against rain and sun.
# Conventional vessels have a traditional cargo operation with top opening hatches and cranes/derricks. On such ships, when facing wet weather, the hatches need to be closed to prevent heavy rain from flooding the holds. Both above ship types are well suited for the handling of palletized and loose cargo.
# Refrigerated container ships are specifically designed to carry containerised unit loads where each container has its individual refrigerated unit. These containers are nearly always twenty-foot equivalent units (often called TEU) that are the size of &quot;standard&quot; cargo containers that are loaded and unloaded at container terminals and aboard container ships. These ships differ from conventional container ships in their design, power generation, and electrical distribution equipment. They need provisions made for powering each container&#x27;s cooling system. Because of their ease of loading and unloading cargo many container ships are now being built or redesigned to carry refrigerated containers.
A major use of refrigerated cargo hold type ships was for the transportation of bananas and frozen meat, but most of these ships have been partly replaced by refrigerated containers that have a refrigeration system attached to the rear end of the container. While on a ship these containers are plugged into an electrical outlet (typically 440 VAC) that ties into the ship&#x27;s power generation. Refrigerated container ships are not limited by the number of refrigeration containers they can carry, unlike other container ships which may be limited in their number of refrigeration outlets or have insufficient generator capacity. Each reefer container unit is typically designed with a stand-alone electrical circuit and has its own breaker switch that allows it to be connected and disconnected as required. In principle each individual unit could be repaired while the ship was still underway.

Refrigerated cargo is a key part of the income for some shipping companies. On multi-purpose ships, refrigerated containers are mostly carried above deck, as they have to be checked for proper operation. Also, a major part of the refrigeration system (such as a compressor) may fail, which would have to be replaced or unplugged quickly in the event of a fire. Modern container vessels stow the reefer containers in cellguides with adjacent inspection walkways that enable reefer containers to be carried in the holds as well as on the deck. Modern refrigerated container vessels are designed to incorporate a water-cooling system for containers stowed under deck. This does not replace the refrigeration system but facilitates cooling down of the external machinery. Containers stowed on the exposed upper deck are air-cooled, while those under deck are water-cooled. The water cooling design allows additional refrigerated containers under deck, as water can be used to dissipate the high amount of heat they generate. This system draws fresh water from the ship&#x27;s water supply, which in turn transfers the heat through heat exchangers to the abundantly available sea water.
There are also refrigeration systems that have two compressors for very precise and low-temperature operations, such as transporting a container of blood to a war zone. Cargoes of shrimp, asparagus, caviar and blood are considered among the most expensive refrigerated items. Bananas, fruit and meat have historically been the main cargo of refrigerated ships.

== History of ship refrigeration ==
In 1869, reefers were shipping beef carcasses frozen in a salt-ice mixture from Indianola, Texas, to New Orleans, Louisiana, to be served in hospitals, hotels, and restaurants. In 1874, shipping of frozen beef from America to London had already begun, which developed into an annual tonnage of around . The insulated cargo space was cooled by ice, which was loaded on departure. The success of this method was limited by insulation, loading techniques, ice block size, distance and climate.

The first attempt to ship refrigerated meat across the Pacific was made when the &quot;Northam&quot; sailed from Australia to the UK in 1876. The refrigeration machinery broke down en route and the cargo was lost. In 1877, the French steamer &quot;Paraguay&quot; equipped with a Carré compression machine completed the first successful travel with its shipment of 5500 frozen muttons from Argentina arriving to France in excellent condition despite a collision that delayed the delivery for several months, thus proving the concept of refrigerated ships, if not the economics. In 1879, &quot;Strathleven&quot;, equipped with compression refrigeration, sailed successfully from Sydney to the UK with 40 tons of frozen beef and mutton as a small part of her cargo.
The clipper sailing ship , owned by the New Zealand and Australian Land Company (NZALC), was refitted in 1881 with a Bell-Coleman compression refrigeration machine. This freezer unit worked by compressing air, then releasing it into the hold of the ship. The expanding air absorbed heat as it expanded, cooling the cargo in the hold. Burning three tons of coal a day in the steam engine that ran the compressor, it could lower the temperature of the hold by compared to the surrounding air temperature, which froze the cargo in the temperate climate of southern New Zealand and then maintained it below freezing () through the tropics. &quot;Dunedin&quot;″s most visible sign of being an unusual ship was the funnel for the refrigeration plant placed between her fore and main masts (sometimes leading her to be mistaken for a steamship which had been common since the 1840s). In February 1882, &quot;Dunedin&quot; sailed from Port Chalmers, New Zealand, with 4,331 mutton, 598 lamb and 22 pig carcasses, 246 kegs of butter, and hare, pheasant, turkey, chicken and 2,226 sheep tongues. It arrived in London after sailing 98 days with its cargo still frozen. After meeting all costs, the NZALC company made a £4,700 profit from the voyage.

Soon after &quot;Dunedin&quot;″s successful voyage, an extensive frozen meat trade from New Zealand and Australia to the UK was developed with over 16 different refrigerated and passenger refrigerated ships built or refitted by 1900 in Scotland and Northern England shipyards for this trade. Within 5 years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. Frozen meat and dairy exports continue to form the backbone of New Zealand&#x27;s economy.

The Nelson brothers, butchers in County Meath, Ireland, started shipping extensive live beef shipments to Liverpool, England. They successfully expanded their beef business until their imports from Ireland were insufficient to supply their rapidly growing business and Nelson decided to investigate the possibility of importing meat from Argentina. The first refrigerated ship they bought was &quot;Spindrift&quot; which they renamed in 1890 SS &quot;Highland Scot&quot;. A vessel of 3,060 gross tons bought by James Nelson and Sons in 1889 and fitted with a somewhat primitive refrigerating plant operating on the cold air system became one of the pioneer vessels in the trade of refrigerated meat and other perishable commodities. They hauled beef carcasses from Argentina to Britain. Their regularly scheduled shipments and ships developed into the Nelson Line that was formed in 1880 for the meat trade from Argentina to UK. Refrigeration made it possible to import meat from the United States, New Zealand, Argentina and Australia.

===Timeline===
*In 1876, French engineer Charles Tellier bought the ex-Elder-Dempster 690 tons cargo ship &quot;Eboe&quot; and fitted a Methyl-ether refrigerating plant of his design. The ship was renamed &quot;Le Frigorifique&quot; and successfully imported a cargo of refrigerated meat from Argentina. However the machinery could be improved and in 1877 another refrigerated ship called &quot;Paraguay&quot; with a refrigerating plant improved by Ferdinand Carré was put into service on the South American run.
*In 1879, Henry Bell (1848–1931) and John Bell (1850–1929) of Scotland and Joseph James Coleman FRSE (1838–1888) of Scotland completed the Bell–Coleman dense-air machine on the Anchor liner &quot;Circassia&quot;, which successfully brought a cargo of chilled beef from the US to London.
*In 1880, &quot;Strathleven&quot;, equipped with a Bell–Coleman air machine and loaded with successfully shipped beef, mutton, butter and kegs, sailed from Melbourne, Australia, to London—a nine-week voyage of about .
*In 1881, Alfred Seale Haslam (1844–1927) of England equipped the liner &quot;Orient&quot; with Haslam refrigeration compressors. He bought the Bell–Coleman dense-air patents in 1878 and eventually equipped four hundred plants and ships with Bell-Coleman machines.
*By 1899, refrigerated fruit ship traffic to the US reached 90,000 tons per year.
*By 1890, after acquiring the patent rights of Franz Windhausen&#x27;s CO2-compression refrigeration system, the J &amp; E Hall company installed the first marine CO2 refrigerator system on the Nelson Line ship &quot;Highland Chief&quot;.
*In 1900, a worldwide survey found 356 refrigerated ships, 37% of which had air machines, 37% ammonia compressors and 25% CO2 compressors.
*In 1900, Great Britain imported over 360,000 metric tons of refrigerated meat: 220,000 tons from Argentina, 95,000 tons from New Zealand and 45,000 tons from Australia. There were weekly sailings on refrigerated &quot;banana boats&quot; from the UK to Central America by Elders and Fyffes Ltd, which had been importing bananas since 1888 to the UK in their own ships. Round trips took 28 days.
*In 1901, the first refrigerated banana ship, &quot;Port Morant&quot;, was equipped with a CO2 machine and carried 23,000 stems of bananas at a controlled temperature from Jamaica to the UK.
*In 1902, Lloyd&#x27;s Register recorded 460 ships with refrigerating plants.
*By 1902, the United Fruit Company started having refrigerated banana boats built in the UK to add to their fleet which hauled passengers and bananas between ports in the United States and Central America.
*By 1910, UK refrigerated meat imports rose to 760,000 tons per year.
*By 1910, the British company J &amp; E Hall had installed 1800 CO2 refrigeration machines in ships.
*By 1913, the UK fleet included 230 refrigerated ships with a total cargo capacity of 440,000 tons.
*By 1935, refrigerated imports into Britain totaled of meat, 500,000 tons of butter, 130,000 tons of cheese, 430,000 tons of apples and pears, and 20 million stems of bananas.

==United Fruit Company reefer ships==
The United Fruit Company has used some type of reefers, often combined with cruise ship passenger accommodations, since about 1889. Because of their cargo was mostly bananas, they were nicknamed the &quot;Banana Fleet&quot;. Since bananas are relatively light and the normal shipping route was to Central America and then back to various US ports, these ships were often built as combination cargo ships and what are now called cruise ships to pay for more of their operating expenses. After about 1910, they called these combination cruise and cargo ships the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; based on their heat-reducing white paint. To avoid US shipping regulations and taxes they are registered in about six other countries, with very few now maintaining US registry. European associates with their own ships were often employed to ship fruit to Europe. United Brands was taken over by Chiquita Brands International in the 1980s and owns the largest fleet of banana boats in the world, but none of them now sails under the US flag. SS &quot;Pastores&quot; and SS &quot;Calamares&quot; were built in Ireland in 1912 and 1913 for the United Fruit Company as a combination cruise ship and refrigerated cargo ship. The United Fruit Company&#x27;s fleet of about 85 ships was one of the largest civilian fleets in the world. These ships normally carried up to 95 cruise ship passengers and a crew to ports in Central America and then would return to the United States with passengers and a cargo of refrigerated bananas and miscellaneous cargo.

The renamed and were taken over by the United States Navy in World War I and used to take troops and refrigerated supplies to and from Europe. After hostilities ceased they were returned to United Fruit Company in 1919. They were requisitioned again on 2 June 1941 from United Fruit for use in World War II. After hostilities ceased they were then returned again to United Fruit Company in 1946.

==Reefers in US Navy service==

===World War I===
In World War I, the US Navy contracted for 18 refrigerated ships for hauling provisions to the troops in Europe. They were launched 1918 and 1919 as the war was ending and were nearly all scrapped by 1933 in the Great Depression as an economy move. Most were built in Baltimore Dry Dock in Baltimore, Maryland, Moore Dry Dock Company in Oakland, California, and Standard SB Co. in Shooters Island, New York.

===World War II===

The s were six United Fruit passenger and refrigerated cargo liners built in 1931–1933 that the United States Maritime Commission requisitioned in 1941–1942. They were USS &quot;Antigua&quot;, , , , and . &quot;Antigua&quot;, although requisitioned, was never commissioned into the Navy. United States Maritime Commission Type R ship were Reefer ships.

In April 1943, the Navy also requisitioned SS &quot;Ulua&quot; from the United Fruit Co. After US navy officers boarded the ship and took possession as it approached the Golden Gate Bridge, the ship became the . It was the last of the UFC &#x27;reefer&#x27; ships to be taken over.

Other reefers converted for US Navy use were the Danish ships , and .

In addition, the US Maritime Commission ordered 41 new refrigerated ships for the Navy. Because of the difficulty of building refrigerated ships only two were delivered in 1944. 26 were delivered in 1945 and the remainder in 1946–1948.

==Worldwide service==
According to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;The World Factbook&quot;, there were about 38,000 registered merchant ships in the world in 2010, of which about 920 were designed as refrigerated cargo ships. Because of the proliferation of self-contained refrigerated container systems on container ships, there are many more ships than those designed for only refrigerated cargo that are also carrying some refrigerated cargo. As of 2010, the countries with the largest numbers of reefer ships in their registries are the world&#x27;s two most prominent flags of convenience: Panama with 212 and Liberia with 109.

<text>Cannon Fodder is a series of war (and later science fiction) themed action games developed by Sensible Software, initially released as &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; for the Commodore Amiga. Only two games in the series were created by Sensible, but were converted to most active systems at the time of release. A sequel, &quot;Cannon Fodder 2&quot;, was released in 1994 for Amiga and DOS. A third game, &quot;Cannon Fodder 3&quot;, was made by a Russian developer and released in English in 2012.

== History ==
&quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; was designed by Jon Hare, co-founder of Sensible Software, and released in 1993 on a variety of platforms. Stuart Cambridge was lead art director on the game and worked with a 16-color palette.

== Gameplay ==

The player is in charge of a squad of between one and eight men that can be, for command purposes, split up to three groups (referred to as Snake, Eagle and Panther squads). All men have a machine gun with unlimited ammunition, as well as limited caches of grenades and rockets that can be found on the map. In later levels, the player is provided with some grenades and rockets at the start of the mission. The player&#x27;s machine guns do not harm its own soldiers, but friendly fire from grenades and rockets is possible, which are also the only weapons capable of destroying buildings and vehicles. Men can also die if hit by debris flung from exploding buildings and vehicles, get caught in man-traps, mired in quicksand, and hit by enemy fire. Men usually walk, but several vehicles are available in some missions.

The games are split into several missions, which are usually sub-divided into phases. Dead soldiers are replaced by new ones at the start of each phase. Each soldier that survives a mission is promoted and receives a small increase in the rate of fire, accuracy, and range. The player is only able to save the game upon completion of a whole mission. Each phase is structured around mission objectives which range from &quot;Kill all enemies&quot; or &quot;Destroy enemy buildings&quot; to &quot;Rescue all hostages&quot;. Some phases are complex, and require the player to use their imagination, pre-planning and strategy. For example, players may have to split their team into two or more groups and leave one group to defend an area or route, assigning its control to the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence, while taking control of another group.

The pre-mission screen shows a hill with a grave for each dead soldier, with recruits lining up in front of it and a sports-like score at the top of the screen. Soldiers each have unique names, while on the grand scale of things being nothing more than interchangeable cannon fodder. The game has hundreds of individually named recruits, of which the first few—Jools, Jops, Stoo and Rj—were named directly after the development staff. As each recruit is killed in battle, he receives a tombstone on the hill and the next recruit in line takes his place.

&quot;Cannon Fodder 2&quot; introduced a variety of new settings: a Middle Eastern conflict, an alien planet and spacecraft, the medieval and gangster-themed Chicago. It nevertheless retained the same mechanics and gameplay. In the new settings, troops wielding grenades and rockets were replaced by such units as aliens and wizards, but nonetheless behaved in the same manner, as did battering rams representing trucks and so forth. The game was more difficult than its predecessor, employing puzzle elements such as multiple ways—of varying effectiveness—to solve levels. It featured reduced use of water obstacles but retained mines and booby traps.

&quot;Cannon Fodder 3&quot; featured a military, counter-terrorism theme with more advanced weather settings. It retained grenades and rockets as the central secondary weapons and introduced further power-ups. It expanded the selection of vehicles and added further enemy installations such as sniper towers. It also features an online cooperative mode.

==Music video==
The theme tune for the game (&quot;War!&quot;) was written by the lead game designer Jon Hare, with musician Richard Joseph. Vocals were sung by Hare himself. A music video of the song was put together to promote the original release.

Shot over just one day and for a total budget of £500, it featured the entire team dressed up in military uniforms, an assortment of masks (including one of Mario and Donald Duck) and toy guns. The version of the music track is more complete than the one that appeared on the 16-bit versions and was recorded professionally. In fact, the menu screen track is also a pared down version of a proper song, featuring studio-standard vocals. Both of these tracks were written and performed by Jon Hare, as were many of the other songs featured in Sensible&#x27;s games.

==Games==
===&quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;===
Production of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; began following the completion of the successful strategy game &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot;. Sensible Software wanted to create another strategy game featuring mouse control and the notion of sending troops on missions, but with more action than had been used in &quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot;. Production began in 1991 but was slowed due to Mega Drive conversions of other games. &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; lost its provisional publisher in the aftermath of owner Robert Maxwell&#x27;s death. As development work resumed, the team gradually reduced the complexity the strategy gameplay in favour of more direct control and action gameplay. In May 1993, Sensible Software found a new publisher in Virgin Interactive, which released the game in November of that year.

Amiga magazines rated the game positively, widely awarding scores of over 90%, while &quot;Amiga Action&quot; awarded an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year. Critics praised the fun, addictiveness, music and humour of the game. The game also drew criticism in the &quot;Daily Star&quot; for its juxtaposition of war and humour and its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy.

====Ports====
Once Sensible Software was sold off to Codemasters, the decision was taken to port the game over to the Game Boy Color. The limit on having two men in your squad and a much smaller playing area meant changes had to be made to the gameplay, mainly to make it easier. Jon Hare described the change as converting &quot;11-a-side football to 5-a-side football&quot;.

In 2004, Jon Hare set up a small mobile phone games team known as Tower Studios. Their first release was &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; in 2004, followed by &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; in 2005. Both titles were published by Kuju Entertainment. The games were only playable on certain color models and, due to many keypads&#x27; inability to register a diagonal movement, the control systems for both games had to be radically redesigned.

===&quot;Cannon Soccer&quot;===
In 1994, a free minigame called &quot;Cannon Soccer&quot; (or &quot;Cannon Fodder - Amiga Format Christmas Special&quot;) was included on the coverdisk of the &quot;Amiga Format&quot; Christmas issue. It was essentially two bonus levels of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; in which the soldiers fought hordes of &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; players in a snowy landscape. The levels were titled &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Snow Time&quot;.

===&quot;Sensible Soccer 92/93 Meets Bulldog Blighty&quot;===
One of the demos on the &quot;Amiga Power&quot; cover disk 21 was &quot;Sensible Soccer Meets Bulldog Blighty&quot;. It featured a mode of play that involved replacing players with soldiers from &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; and the ball with a hand grenade. The grenade would randomly begin to flash and would eventually explode after a few minutes, killing any nearby players. The magazine described it as a &quot;1944 version of &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;&quot;, though &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; compared it to the Christmas-time football match in 1914.

===&quot;Cannon Fodder 2&quot;===

&quot;Cannon Fodder 2&quot; is a 1994 sequel featuring very similar gameplay and graphics to the point where an &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; review suggested it had more in common with a data disk than a true sequel. The game featured levels set in deserts and an Alien spaceship as well as levels with a medieval theme. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; rated the game at 71%. A major difference in the sequel is that the plot involves time travel.

The designer Stuart Campbell wrote: &quot;&quot;CF2&quot; was a cross-cultural kinda game. Levels were inspired by films, music, other games, politics and events. Titles came from songs, books, and all manner of other sources&quot;.

===Cancelled sequels===
After selling Sensible Software to Codemasters, Jon Hare ended up consulting on many of their development projects, one of which was the PS2 title &quot;Prince Naseem Boxing&quot;. Work on this title was performed in a satellite studio based in Hammersmith, London. However, due to the commercial failure of this title, the studio was shut down. A casualty of this was cancellation of a 3D remake of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;, something that Hare had been working on for at least nine months. Hare did speak about how he was looking to expand on the whole theme of war and include gameplay not just set on the battlefield: &quot;I&#x27;d like to focus on the public&#x27;s perceptions of war and warfare. There&#x27;s many interesting things that go on behind the scenes with politicians&quot;.

In an interview with Eurogamer in late 2005, Hare confirmed that there was up to two years&#x27; work (on and off) put into a 3D update of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;: &quot;I designed &quot;Cannon Fodder 3&quot; with Codies six years ago, development stopped and started three times and eventually it was seemingly permanently halted when the London studio was closed four years ago. Nothing would please me more than to see this project resurrected, it was very advanced in its structure and therefore would need little modernisation&quot;.

In August 2006, Codemasters London announced a brand new version of &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The game would have retained its familiar top down view, and the big heads of the soldiers, and for the first time the game would have been 3D. After a large launch announcement which included character renders and screenshots, the game was quietly canceled without explanation. In a later interview, Hare said that Codemasters was hit with economic problems and was forced to sell the studio.

===&quot;Cannon Fodder 3&quot;===

In 2008, now intellectual property owner Codemasters licensed Russian publisher Game Factory Interactive to develop another sequel. GFI created the game along with developer Burut CT and released it in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States on December 19, 2011. English-language media speculated on whether GFI was permitted to release the game outside of that region, but Codemasters ultimately clarified it had reserved but declined the option of publishing the game. GFI released the game in Europe and North America in February 2012 via a download service. 

The game retains the core style of its predecessors but with more advanced graphics, a counter-terrorism theme and a greater array of weapons and units. It includes 26 locations around the world and on the moon. English-language publications gave the game mixed, mediocre reviews, with both more positive, and negative reviews appearing elsewhere in Europe.

<text>was a town located in Katori District, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.

Omigawa has been settled since prehistoric times, with numerous shell middens and burial mounds from the Japanese Paleolithic through Kofun period. During the Edo period, it was the center of Omigawa Domain, a feudal domain of the Tokugawa shogunate. Modern Omigawa Town was created in the early Meiji period.

On March 27, 2006, Omigawa, along with the city of Sawara, and the towns of Kurimoto and Yamada (both from Katori District), was merged to create the city of Katori, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

In November 2005 (the last data available before its merger into Katori), the town had an estimated population of 25,420 and a population density of 411 persons per km2. Its total area was 61.84 km2.

<text>The Kitchener bun is a type of sweet pastry made and sold in South Australia since 1915. It consists of a bun sometimes baked, sometimes fried, made from a sweet yeasted dough similar to that used for making doughnuts, split and then filled with raspberry or strawberry jam and cream, most often with a dusting of sugar on the top.

The Kitchener bun resembles the Berliner, a pastry of German origin – although distinguished from it by an open face and the use of more cream than jam – and was, in fact, known as such until anti-German sentiment in World War I led to its renaming in honour of the British field marshal Lord Kitchener.

In a 1930 recipe the jam is sealed into the pastry before deep-frying in fat, and there is no mention of cream until 1934. Ten years later, an Unley Road baker was fined £15 2 (around $1000) for using cream in his Kitchener buns, contrary to provisions in the National Security Regulations.

<doc id="862876" wikidata="Q654134" url="?curid=862876" title="Taiseki-ji">
<text>&#x27;, more commonly just &#x27;, informally known as , is the administrative center of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism. It is located in the foothills of Mount Fuji in Kamijo, Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.
Taiseki-ji was founded in 1290 by Nikkō Shōnin, one of Nichiren Daishonin&#x27;s senior disciples, on a land parcel donated by the pious believer Daigyo Sonrei, commonly known as Nanjo Tokimitsu (1259–1332).

The Head Temple is the home of the Dai Gohonzon, Nichiren Shoshu&#x27;s object of worship, which draws pilgrim believers from various countries. The temple&#x27;s open grounds are open to the public for sightseeing, though its religious buildings are restricted only to registered believers. Accordingly, adherents of the Soka Gakkai are not permitted entrance to the Head Temple grounds.

==Description==

Taiseki-ji is Nichiren Shoshu&#x27;s administrative center, and its Chief Priest is simultaneously the high priest () of Nichiren Shoshu. The current 68th High Priest is Nichinyo Hayase (1935 – Present) who assumed the position on 16 December 2005.

Taiseki-ji is the home of the Dai Gohonzon, Nichiren Shoshu&#x27;s object of worship. This image is visited by believers who come on personal pilgrimages, to participate in regular ceremonies, or to take part in large events such as study programs, and similar large meetings. The temple is known for numerous historically significant buildings and gardens, national cultural assets, as well as features like the old weeping cherry trees that line its &quot;Tatchū Sando&quot; (main path lined with lodging temples).

==History== 

According to Nichiren Shoshu tradition, Taiseki-ji was founded in 1290 by Nichiren&#x27;s disciple Nikkō on a tract of land called donated by the district steward, &quot;Nanjo Shichiro Jiro Hyoe Taira no Tokimitsu&quot; (Buddhist name: &quot;Daigyo Sonrei&quot;) (1259–1332). The name derives from an alternative reading of the kanji for Ōishi (大石), &quot;Tai (Big) - Seki (Stone)&quot;, and the character &quot;Ji&quot; (寺), temple.

Tokimitsu was a lay follower of Nichiren&#x27;s and consequently Nikko Shonin. Taiseki-ji started with one small temple building, the &quot;Mutsubo&quot; with six rooms, but grew gradually as Nikkō&#x27;s disciples built sub-temples. It went through further growth phases during the mid-Edo period and after the Second World War.

According to Nichiren Shoshu doctrine, their religious founder Nichiren willed that the image be established with a national shrine at the foot of Mount Fuji with a special title named &quot;Honmonji&quot; when the conversion of the Japanese Emperor and widespread propagation was achieved.

Due to its strong prohibition against accepting monetary donations from non-believers, there is no offertory box available at the temple. Believers are confirmed to be registered members before they are allowed to give &quot;Gokuyo&quot; or offerings. There is also no &quot;Goshuincho&quot; (御朱印帳 or &quot;red stamping&quot; of Daimoku or Talisman booklets normally sold to tourists, considered by the religion to be a form of sacrilege.

In addition, neither the Head Temple nor the religious stores outside Taiseki-ji accept any currency besides Japanese Yen towards any donation offerings, memorial service fees, food and lodging fees or any religious merchandise transactions.

==Activities at the Head Temple==
===Gongyo===
The Buddhist service of &quot;Gongyo&quot; (勤行 , Persevering Action) is the basic supplemental service of Hokkeko believers. It is conducted first as the Ushitora Gongyo at the Dai Kyakuden (Grand Reception Hall), among other places throughout the Head Temple. In past centuries, the service was performed in five different locations:

* Facing the sunrise direction 
* Facing the Mieido
* Facing the Gohozo
* Facing the Kyakuden
* Facing the Mutsubo

The sect, along with the other Fuji sects in the area, followed the custom of reciting the Sutra chapters according to what Nichiren himself once did:

* Junyoze — Reciting the prose (散文, &quot;Sanbun&quot;) of Chapter 2 
* Seoge — Reciting the verse (自我偈, &quot;Jigage&quot;) of Chapter 2
* Chogyo — Reciting the prose (&quot;Sanbun&quot;) of Chapter 16 
* Nyorai Juryo — Reciting the verse (&quot;Jigage&quot;) of Chapter 16

During the 1930s, the Gongyo service was shortened to a single format, initiated by religious convert Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and was approved by 57th High Priest Nissho Shonin. Today, some Nichiren sects in the Mount Fuji area recite the full versions of the 2nd and 16th Chapter of the Lotus Sutra.

The current version of Gongyo since the 1930s is the recitations of Chapter 2 in prose and Chapter 16 in prose and verse along with the five morning and three evening silent prayers (五座三座, Goza-Sanza) for the purpose of the following:

# Receiving protection from the Buddhist gods (Shoten Zenjin)
# Prayer to the Dai Gohonzon 
# Prayer for lineage of the priesthood
# Conversion of the Emperor of Japan and widespread propagation
# Prayers for deceased ancestors and their rebirth in Hokkeko

Additional services such as funeral, prolonged chanting (Shodai) and other commemoration ceremonies for historical personalities associated with the Head Temple are also conducted.

===Tozan pilgrimages=== 
Pilgrimage to Taiseki-ji draws adherents of Nichiren Shoshu annually through group trips that are planned by local branch temples, as well as private individual trips. This pilgrimage in the sectarian parlance is called &quot;Tozan&quot; (登山, &quot;Mountaineering, to climb the mountain&quot;) for the purpose of worshipping the Dai Gohonzon in person. The sect bases this practice in the ancient custom of early supporters of Nichiren who also visited him during his lifetime over perilous roads and mountains, now re-interpreted as a similar pilgrimage towards the Dai Gohonzon, which represents Nichiren in a mandala format.

=== The Gokaihi ceremony ===
In Japan, a &quot;Gokaihi&quot; (御開扉, English: &quot;Sacred Opening of (Butsudan) Doors&quot;) is a ceremonial rite that exposes a particular sacred Buddhist image that is hidden and revered in a particular religion or sect. In Nichiren Shoshu ritual practices, this refers to the ceremonial audience with the Dai Gohonzon officiated by the High Priest granted to Hokkeko believers who have personally requested to participate, which is oftentimes the main purpose of a pilgrimage visit to the Head Temple. The volition of free will, confirmation of registered membership and an offertory fee is part of the protocol to enter the Hoando building to participate in the service.

==List of buildings==
The following significant buildings are listed for their historical and architectural value:

The &quot;Sanmon&quot; (written 三門, sometimes 山門) gate is Taiseki-ji&#x27;s &quot;main front door&quot; and has been designated as a Shizuoka prefectural cultural asset. It was built in 1717 with financial assistance from Lady Hiroko Konoe (also known as “Tennei-in”), the daughter of Imperial Princess Tsuneko and wife of sixth Shōgun Tokugawa Ienobu. A Gohonzon transcribed by 25th High Priest Nichiyu Shonin is enshrined within its upper floor. At the time, she donated 300 ryō for its construction. Positioned next to public government roads, it was significantly vandalized and defaced with graffiti in 1997. It was recently restored, and its Gohonzon was ceremoniously re-enshrined within again on 15 January 2021.

===&quot;Mutsubō&quot;===

The first was erected in 1290 as Taiseki-ji&#x27;s first building. It has been rebuilt many times since, but the Gohonzon (object of veneration) it houses is attributed to temple founder Nikkō Shōnin dating from November 1332. It maintains its original design of having six rooms. The current structure, which uses much &quot;keyaki&quot; heartwood, was completed in 1988. The High Priest of Nichiren Shoshu proceeds to the Mutsubō on concluding Ushitora Gongyo in the Kyakuden (see below) to perform another gongyo recitation with young priests and acolytes.

===&quot;Kyakuden&quot;===

The is one of the central structures where the majority of ceremonies are held, including Ushitora Gongyo by each successive High Priest every morning. It was built in 1465 and later rebuilt in 1998.

The &quot;Kyakuden&quot; was rebuilt as the , with the assistance of the Soka Gakkai, a modern-style building inaugurated April 1964. That structure, was demolished in September 1995 and rebuilt as the current Kyakuden in 1998 with its wood-clad steel-framed edifice. The priesthood cited the Dai-Kyakuden&#x27;s imposing ferroconcrete mass as incongruent with the architectural tone appropriate for a temple compound.
The &quot;Kyakuden&quot; is the site of Ushitora Gongyo, a daylight prayer service officiated by the High Priest or his proxy. The Ozagawari Joza Gohonzon, original paper on 13 October 1290 (&quot;Gohonzon of the Seat of the Dharma&quot;) was rendered into wood and carved on 15 June 1706, now enshrined on the central altar on the second floor of the Kyakuden.

This 1706 wooden mandala is flanked by lifesize statues of Nichiren Daishonin (left) and Nikkō Shōnin (right) as a symbolic representation of “San—Po” or “Three Treasures style”, though the “Object of Worship” remains the central mandala. The two grand statues were carved in 1660 during the reign of 17th High Priest Nissei Shonin. 

===&quot;Mieidō&quot;===
The &quot;Mieido&quot; (image hall, 御影堂) is the &quot;hondō&quot; (本堂) or main official hall of Taisekiji temple. It traces its history to a building called the Mido (Midō: 御堂) erected by Nikko Shonin when he founded Taisekiji in 1290. It takes its name from a lifesize image of Nichiren sculpted by Japanese Buddhist artisan &quot;Echizen Hōkyō Kaikei&quot;, a carver of Buddhist images. This image was enshrined in the year 1388 in a building that was then replaced in 1522. The current, classical structure was erected in 1632 with donations from the Lady Manhime Ogasawara (Also known as &quot;Kyōdai-in&quot;), who was the wife of Lord Hachisuka Yoshishige of the Tokushima Castle.. The building is designed similarly to a Kabuki-za theater filled with various ornaments. In 1680 (Enpō year), the Dai Gohonzon image was stored here for safekeeping. An enlarged statue of Nichiren is enshrined in front of the Mandala as the aesthetic of the building represents various Buddhist images.

Several rounds of expansions, improvements, and repairs have been undertaken since then, and it was designated a prefectural tangible cultural property by Shizuoka Prefecture after major repairs in 1971. The most recent overhaul was finished in November 2013. The seven-year project entailed completely breaking down and reassembling the building piece by piece. All the parts were catalogued, mapped, and their condition recorded. Damaged structural members were repaired or replaced, and decorative fixtures such as transom carvings and other artwork, were painstaking restored. When the building was reassembled, aseismic structural augmentation (dampers) was installed to protect it from earthquake damage. New gold leaf was applied to the indoor pillars, and all exposed surfaces were finished with vermilion using traditional methods. The building is known for its decorative transoms that depict various Buddhist deities that are believed to occupy the &quot;Treasure Tower of the Lotus Sutra&quot;.
 A decorative Stupa is erected nearby the Mieido to commemorate the donations of Lady Manhime Ogasawara remains present to this day.

===&quot;Hōandō&quot;=== 
The Enshrinement Hall, built in 2002, houses the Dai Gohonzon of the High Sanctuary of the Essential Teaching, the supreme object of worship in Nichiren Shōshū. The Hōandō is built in the style of a &quot;Kura&quot; storehouse to signify that the Nichiren Shoshu faith has not yet taken hold as the primary religion of the world&#x27;s people. Nichiren Shoshu claims that Nichiren willed that the Dai Gohonzon is not to be made publicly accessible, but rather stored away and only viewed by those who have asked for and been granted an audience by the High Priest, until such time. Another interpretation of this is that, as different from all other Nichiren Shoshu altars, the one in the Hōandō has neither offerings of evergreens nor drums, and non-believers are not permitted entry. Handicapped believers and their attendants are given priority entry and seating within the building.

On the high altar, the &quot;Shumidan&quot;, of the Hōandō is a Buddhist Stupa containing the ashes of Nichiren Daishonin (left), a grand Butsudan housing the Dai Gohonzon (center), and another stupa containing a statue of Nichiren Daishonin carved by Izumi Ajari Nippō Shōnin from the same camphorwood leftover plank that the Dai Gohonzon was inscribed on; while pious tradition claims that Nichiren approvingly characterized the statue as an exact image of himself.

Taiseki-ji has traditionally regarded the Mieidō (see above) as the temple&#x27;s &quot;Hondō&quot; (main hall), but only its provisional main hall until wide propagation is achieved, when the building housing the Dai Gohonzon would take over that role.

The Hōandō replaced the controversial name of the Shōhondō (正本堂: true main hall), after its demolition in April 1998. (See below for details on demolished buildings)

===&quot;Gohōzō&quot; and &quot;Hōanden&quot;===

The (&quot;Treasure House&quot;) houses various religious scrolls and paintings, and other religious and historical records, relics, and artifacts. It possesses the original &quot;Gosho&quot; documents of Nichiren conversing with the Buddhist deity Hachiman, as well as a personal letter given to Lord Nanjo Tokimitsu while he was alive. In addition, all Gohonzons transcribed by Nichiren Shoshu priests are stored within this building, which are mostly taken out in April for the &quot;Omushibarai Ceremony&quot;.

In addition, it also features modest displays of cultural objects donated by pilgrims from countries where they have attracted converts. The Hōanden (奉安殿) building, where the Dai Gohonzon was once enshrined, stands behind it.

===&quot;Gojunoto&quot; pagoda===

Completed on 12 June 1749 with the assistance of the Japanese Edo government, this religious pagoda was built with donations of 5,000 gold Ryō given by the daughter of Imperial Princess Tsuneko. Her daughter, the Lady Hiroko Konoe (also known as Tennei-in), who was the wife of Ienobu Tokugawa, the sixth Tokugawa Shogun gave this donation with the solemn approval of Nichikan Shonin, the 26th High Priest.

It has five stories representing the characters of 妙法蓮華經 (English: “Myo-Ho-Ren-Ge-Kyo”) measuring at 112 feet and faces west rather than the usual south, with a claim that Nichiren&#x27;s Buddhism would spread from the East (Japan) to the Western lands; that is, back to the land of Shakyamuni Buddha and to the rest of the world.

This pagoda is the largest five-storied pagoda along the Tōkaidō, the historical main highway along Japan&#x27;s eastern seaboard from Edo (today&#x27;s Tokyo) to Kyoto. A Gohonzon transcribed by 31st High Priest Nichi-in Shonin is enshrined within, dated to 28 March 1749.

In 1966, the pagoda was designated a national cultural treasure. In 2017, it was structurally reinforced and artistically restored. Its doors are ceremoniously opened once each year on February 16 to celebrate Nichiren&#x27;s birthday for the “O-tanjo ceremony”, followed by the formal opening of its doors called the “O-tobiraki ceremony”.

===Graves ===
* On the left rear of the Pagoda is the 1945 grave and Stupa of the first Soka Gakkai President Tsunesaburo Makiguchi. 
* The second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda is located at the left front of the pagoda. His ashes were moved from Jozai-ji temple (Toshima, Tokyo), and re—interred here in 2001.
* The debonair actor Keiichirō Akagi (1939—1961) is also buried at the L-2 ward section of the head temple cemetery, nearby the Pagoda. 

===&quot;Daikōdō&quot;=== 

The &quot;Daikōdō&quot; (&quot;English: Grand Auditorium&quot;) was donated by Soka Gakkai, with construction began in December 1956 and completed on 1 March 1958. It houses a so-called “Mannen-Kugo” aesthetic-style design which was originally dated and inscribed by Nichiren himself in December 1274 and later co-signed by the Yoshihama Myohonji Temple located in Kyonan, Chiba prefecture.

A wooden transcription image of this &quot;Gohonzon&quot; was carved and signed by Taisekiji priest-sculptor named “Eritsu Hiki Bhikkhu” (Claimed to be Mr. Takeshi Itamoto) in January 1687 (Jōkyō year IV) assumingly in commemoration for the new incoming 30th High Priest Nitchu Shonin.

Upon the completion of this grand auditorium in 1958, the 65th High Priest Nichijun Shonin decided to enshrine this wooden &quot;Gohonzon&quot; within this building where it remains today. Presently, this Gohonzon is flanked by the two &quot;Ihai&quot; memorial tablets of second High Priest Nikkō Shonin and his successor, third High Priest Nichimoku as an expressed style aesthetic that both disciples were once able to listen to Nichiren&#x27;s preaching in correlation to the purpose of the building as an Auditorium. It is in a dilapidated condition and scheduled for demolition and reconstruction after completion of the new Sanmon gate in 2021.

The former highest lay leader of Hokkeko believers (&quot;Hokkeko Sokoto&quot;), Jōsei Toda addressed youth adherents from this building on 16 March 1958.

==Demolished buildings==
===&quot;Shōhondō&quot;===
The &quot;Shōhondō&quot; (正本堂, True Main Hall) was a building at Taiseki-ji, which opened on 12 October 1972 and was subsequently demolished in 1998. Former Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda, who emphasized the building of monuments to the success of the movement, made the request to build the new structure which became the Shohondo.

Religious professor Daniel A. Métraux claims that the Soka Gakkai placed particular importance on the building of the Shohondo, based on interpretations of doctrine not shared by the Nichiren Shoshu sect as a whole, and therefore controversy over its status arose at its construction.

The &quot;Shōhondō&quot; was inaugurated by the Soka Gakkai who claimed it as the &quot;True High Sanctuary&quot;, Kaidan, which was a title disputed by conservative groups within the sect including the Myoshinko (now known as Kenshōkai) lay organisation, and the Nichiren Shoshu Priesthood. In Nichiren Shoshu doctrine, that sanctuary title was allegedly reserved for a future temple to be built at the base of Mount Fuji on the completion of Kosen Rufu, as solely decreed by the Emperor of Japan when the entire nation has converted to Nichiren&#x27;s Buddhism.

Métraux explained that the Soka Gakkai was reinterpreting doctrine and maintained that they could consider the &quot;Shōhondō&quot; as the &quot;True High Sanctuary&quot;, Kaidan, about which Nichiren wrote, because through the Soka Gakkai Nichiren&#x27;s philosophy was spread through Japan and was positively impacting people. The importance of the Shohondo was, therefore, a highly contentious matter dividing the Soka Gakkai and other factions within the faith.

High Priest Nittatsu Hosoi, clarified that the &quot;Shōhondō&quot; was not the True High Sanctuary about which Nichiren wrote, though directed the Shōhondō as a temporary home for the Dai-Gohonzon, the permanent home of the Dai-Gohonzon would be the future True High Sanctuary.

The construction of the &quot;Shōhondō&quot; was funded largely by donations from lay believers of Nichiren Shoshu. In 1968, approximately 8 million Soka Gakkai adherents contributed money to the construction. An estimated grand total of ¥35,536,000,000 was raised:
* ¥ 35,064,300,000.00 came from the Sōka Gakkai lay organization.
* ¥ 313,820,000.00 from the Hokkekō lay organization 
* ¥ 157,870,000.00 from Nichiren Shoshu priests and their families.

The building was demolished in 1998, the official reason given by Nichiren Shoshu for the demolition was the discovery of rust on the pillars within the temple. Engineers discovered that ocean sand had been used in the mortar of the building, risking the Dai Gohonzon&#x27;s safety during an earthquake. The school also concedes that its demolition of the Shōhondō was an extension of the doctrinal dispute between it and Sōka Gakkai, emphasizing the impiety of the organisation as heretics for deviating from its formal doctrines of orthodoxy.

American architects Richard Meier and Robert Arthur Stern both disparaged the demolition. Terence Riley, former chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York opined that the planned demolition would be a &quot;regrettable finale&quot; to a century that has &quot;witnessed so much loss&quot;.

==Nearby buildings==
===Myoren-ji Temple===
An approximate thirty-minute walk from the Head Temple is Myoren-ji, which is another former “Head Temple” of the various Fuji schools which conjoined with Taisekiji in the 25 December 1950 during the proselytizing efforts of former Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda. The temple was once a former residence of Nanjo Tokimitsu, the person who donated the land of Taisekiji to Nikko Shonin. The temple&#x27;s name derives from the Buddhist name (&quot;kaimyō&quot;) Nanjo Tokimitsu&#x27;s wife, Myōren, whose historical birth name is unknown. This temple houses many historically significant artifacts, in particular, the Gohonzon enshrined in its main altar, which was transcribed by Nikko Shonin in the year 1315, and a small, decorative statue of Nichiren that is preserved as a historical remembrance. The temple is known for the unique format of its &quot;Oeshiki&quot; ceremony commemorating the death of Nichiren. Since 25 December 1950, it has been under the sacerdotal administration of the Nichiren Shoshu sect.

<text>Hantec () is a unique dialect previously spoken among lower classes in Brno, Czech Republic during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It developed from the mixing of the Czech language as spoken in Moravia with the languages of other residents of Brno, including Germans and Jews. Today Hantec exists in its original form only among some elderly people, but many words and expressions have become a part of Czech spoken in Brno.

<text>&quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; is a narrative poem by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, first published in &quot;Ballads and Other Poems&quot; in 1842. It is a story that presents the tragic consequences of a skipper&#x27;s pride. On an ill-fated voyage in winter, he brings his daughter aboard ship for company. The skipper ignores the advice of one of his experienced men, who fears that a hurricane is approaching. When the storm arrives, the skipper ties his daughter to the mast to prevent her from being swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father as she hears the surf beating on the shore, then prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto the reef of Norman&#x27;s Woe and sinks; the next morning a horrified fisherman finds the daughter&#x27;s body, still tied to the mast and drifting in the surf. The poem ends with a prayer that all be spared such a fate &quot;on the reef of Norman&#x27;s Woe.&quot;

The poem was published in the &quot;New World&quot;, edited by Park Benjamin, which appeared on January 10, 1840. Longfellow was paid $25 for it, .

==Inspiration==
Longfellow combined fact and fiction to create this poem. His inspiration was the great blizzard of 1839, which ravaged the north-east coast of the United States for 12 hours starting January 6, 1839, destroying 20 ships with a loss of 40 lives. The poem appears to combine two events. Longfellow probably drew for the specifics on the destruction of the &quot;Favorite&quot;, a ship from Wiscasset, Maine, on the reef of Norman&#x27;s Woe off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts. All aboard were lost, one a woman, who reportedly floated to shore dead but still tied to the mast. The name used in the poem is that of another vessel, lost near Boston. The poem is so well known that the loop road leading close to Norman&#x27;s Woe from Route 127 is named Hesperus Ave.

In December 1839, Longfellow wrote in his diary about the writing of &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;:

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; was adapted into films of the same name in 1927 and 1948. 

==Legacy==
&quot;&quot; is an archaic simile for something or someone untidy or bedraggled.

The poem has inspired titles in various media:

* In 1901, Irish composer William Harvey Pélissier wrote a cantata of this name on Longfellow&#x27;s text.
* It was the inspiration for a 1944 Mighty Mouse cartoon of the same name.
* The Pleasure Island amusement park in Wakefield, Massachusetts (1958–1970), 18 miles south-west of the site where the fictional &quot;Hesperus&quot; sank, featured a ride named &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus&quot;.
* The rock band Procol Harum included their song &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; on their album &quot;A Salty Dog&quot; (1969).
* George Harrison included a song titled &quot;Wreck of the Hesperus&quot; on his 1987 album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;.
* Wreck of the Hesperus is the name of an Irish doom/drone metal band.

<text>Absolute space and time is a concept in physics and philosophy about the properties of the universe. In physics, absolute space and time may be a preferred frame.

==Early concept==
A version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame) can be seen in Aristotelian physics. Robert S. Westman writes that a &quot;whiff&quot; of absolute space can be observed in Copernicus&#x27;s &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;, where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.

==Newton==
Originally introduced by Sir Isaac Newton in &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated Newtonian mechanics. According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:

Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...

According to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time.

These notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute rest, or moving at some absolute speed. To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in absolute rotation about their center of gravity (barycenter) by observing the tension in the rope.

==Differing views==

Historically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. Gottfried Leibniz was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies. George Berkeley suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity, an example later raised by Albert Einstein in his development of general relativity.

A more recent form of these objections was made by Ernst Mach. Mach&#x27;s principle proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, mass is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton&#x27;s examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.

When, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity &quot;in space&quot;, our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to &quot;the entire universe&quot;.—Ernst Mach

These views opposing absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce operational definitions for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity.

Even within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of inertial frame of reference has taken precedence, that is, a preferred &quot;set&quot; of frames of reference that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to Galilean relativity, leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojević:
* The existence of absolute space contradicts the internal logic of classical mechanics since, according to Galilean principle of relativity, none of the inertial frames can be singled out.
* Absolute space does not explain inertial forces since they are related to acceleration with respect to any one of the inertial frames.
* Absolute space acts on physical objects by inducing their resistance to acceleration but it cannot be acted upon.
Newton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.

The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.

As a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the fixed stars. See Inertial frame of reference for more discussion on this.

==Mathematical definitions==

&quot;Space&quot;, as understood in Newtonian mechanics, is three-dimensional and Euclidean, with a fixed orientation. It is denoted &quot;E&quot;3. If some point &quot;O&quot; in &quot;E&quot;3 is fixed and defined as an origin, the &quot;position&quot; of any point &quot;P&quot; in &quot;E&quot;3 is uniquely determined by its radius vector formula_1 (the origin of this vector coincides with the point &quot;O&quot; and its end coincides with the point &quot;P&quot;). The three-dimensional linear vector space &quot;R&quot;3 is a set of all radius vectors. The space &quot;R&quot;3 is endowed with a scalar product ⟨ , ⟩.

&quot;Time&quot; is a scalar which is the same in all space &quot;E&quot;3 and is denoted as &quot;t&quot;. The ordered set { &quot;t&quot; } is called a time axis.

&quot;Motion&quot; (also &quot;path&quot; or &quot;trajectory&quot;) is a function &quot;r&quot; : Δ → &quot;R&quot;3 that maps a point in the interval Δ from the time axis to a position (radius vector) in &quot;R&quot;3.

The above four concepts are the &quot;well-known&quot; objects mentioned by Isaac Newton in his Principia:
:&quot;I do not define time, space, place and motion, as being well known to all.&quot;

==Special relativity==
The concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of special relativity theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame&#x27;s motion. In Einstein&#x27;s theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of spacetime in special relativity, and curved spacetime in general relativity.

Absolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a relativity of simultaneity. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference, which negates absolute simultaneity.

==Einstein==

Quoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term aether with &quot;properties of space&quot;, a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in general relativity the &quot;aether&quot; is not absolute anymore, as the geodesic and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter.

==General relativity==
Special relativity eliminates absolute time (although Gödel and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity) and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of geodesics. There appears to be absolute space in relation to the distant stars because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system&#x27;s physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.

<text>Gaetano Fedele Polidori (5 August 1763 – 16 December 1853) was an Italian writer and scholar living in Highgate. He was the son of Agostino Ansano Polidori (1714–1778), a physician and poet who lived and practised in his native Bientina, near Pisa, Tuscany.

Polidori studied law at the University of Pisa. He became secretary to the tragedian Vittorio Alfieri in 1785 and remained with him four years.

He came to England from Paris in 1790 after resigning as Alfieri&#x27;s secretary. He settled in Highgate, working as an Italian teacher and translator. He translated various literary works, notably, John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, besides other writings of Milton and Lucan. He wrote prolifically, producing his own fiction, poetry, criticism, and tragedies.
He also set up a private press at his home, where amongst other works (mostly his own), he printed the first editions of some poems by his grandchildren, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti. 
He also printed an edition of the poem &quot;Osteologia&quot;, which his father Agostino Ansano Polidori had written in 1763.

He retired to a house in Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire in 1836.

==Family==
On 29 January 1793, Gaetano Polidori married an English governess, Anna Maria Pierce of Middlesex (b. c. 1774), and they had four children. 
His oldest son John William Polidori was a physician to Lord Byron and author of the first vampire story in English, &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819).

His daughter Frances (Frances Mary Lavinia Polidori, 27 April 1800 – 8 April 1886) in 1826 married exiled Italian scholar Gabriele Rossetti. They had four children, Maria Francesca Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Michael Rossetti and Christina Georgina Rossetti. After Gabriele&#x27;s death in 1854, Frances quickly burned the remaining copies of his book &quot;Il Mistero dell&#x27; Amor Platonico del Medio Evo&quot;. Frances herself died in 1886 and was buried in the family plot at Highgate Cemetery.

Maria (1827–1876), wrote a book about Dante Alighieri and later became an Anglican nun.

Gabriel Charles Dante (1828–1882) and William Michael (1829–1919) were among the co-founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Frances sat for Gabriel for some of his early paintings, for example, &quot;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&quot;, in which she modelled for Saint Anne.

Christina Georgina (1830–1894) became famous as a poet and is probably best known as the author of the poem &quot;Goblin Market&quot;.

<text>Smolyan () is a town and ski resort in the south of Bulgaria near the border with Greece. It is the administrative and industrial centre of the Smolyan Province. The town is built along the narrow valley of the Cherna (&#x27;black&#x27;) and the Byala (&#x27;white&#x27;) river in the central Rhodope Mountains. It is located at the foot of the mountain&#x27;s highest peak Golyam Perelik (2191 m). Popular ski resorts of Pamporovo and Chepelare lie in the vicinity. As of June 2022 the town has a population of 30 689 inhabitants.

==Name==
The name of the town comes from the local Slavic tribe of the Smolyani, the name of whom is probably cognate to the Slavic word &quot;smola&quot; (&quot;resin&quot;).

==History==

According to archaeological evidence, the area around Smolyan was first settled in the 2nd-1st millennium BC. In the Middle Ages it acquired its name from the Slavic tribe, the &quot;Smolyani&quot;, who settled in the region in the 7th century. During the Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Part of the Byzantine and Bulgarian Empires. For a while during the 14th century it came under the control of the Bulgarian feudal lord Momchil, alongside the whole Rhodope mountains, before eventually being subjugated by the Ottoman Empire. During the Ottoman period the town was renamed to &quot;Paşmaklı&quot;. It remained under Ottoman rule for five centuries, a township of the Ottoman Sanjak of Gümülcine in the Adrianople Vilayet between 1867 and 1912. It remained a Muslim-majority town with a large Christian minority until 1912.

The area was liberated by the 21st Sredna Gora Regiment led by Vladimir Serafimov in 1912, during the First Balkan War. However, the town retained its Ottoman-era name &quot;Paşmaklı&quot; until 1934, when it was changed to &quot;Smolyan&quot; by official decree. The modern town of Smolyan was formed by the merger of three existing villages — Ustovo, Raykovo and Ezerovo — in 1960.

== Population ==
The population of Smolyan just after World War II was about 5,000. Since then, it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns, reaching its peak in the beginning of the 1990s, exceeding 34,000.

===Ethnic linguistic and religious composition===
According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:
*Bulgarians: 25,045 (97.0%)
*Roma: 258 (1.0%)
*Turks: 153 (0.6%)
*Others: 120 (0.5%)
*Indefinable: 248 (1.0%)
**Undeclared: 4,818 (15.7%)
Total: 30,642

In Smolyan Municipality 32708 declared as Bulgarians, 301 as Roma and 170 as Turks, and 9,000 did not declare their ethnic group.

== Culture and sports ==
Due to its suitable location on top of Mount Rozhen, the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory is located nearby, with a planetarium in operation in the town. There is one theatre, the Rhodope Drama Theatre, and a gathering of theatre practitioners and scholars known as The Rhodopi International Theatre Laboratory is held every summer. There is also a regional historical museum founded in 1935.

Smolyan has an elite division football team, PFC Rodopa Smolyan, that had been playing in the A Professional Football Group between 2003-2007.

The largest church in southern Bulgaria, the Cathedral of Saint Vissarion of Smolyan, was inaugurated in the city in July 2006.

<doc id="862904" wikidata="Q1075470" url="?curid=862904" title="Expressive language disorder">
<text>Expressive language disorder is one of the &quot;specific developmental disorders of speech and language&quot; recognized by the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). As of the eleventh edition (ICD-11, current 1 January 2022), it is considered to be covered by the various categories of developmental language disorder. Transition to the ICD-11 will take place at a different time in different countries.

The condition is a communication disorder in which there are difficulties with verbal and written expression. It is a specific language impairment characterized by an ability to use expressive spoken language that is markedly below the appropriate level for the mental age, but with a language comprehension that is within normal limits. There can be problems with vocabulary, producing complex sentences, and remembering words, and there may or may not be abnormalities in articulation.

Careful diagnosis is also important because &quot;atypical language development can be a secondary characteristic of other physical and developmental problems that may first manifest as language problems&quot;.

== Causes ==
Expressive language disorder is not well understood. It does not have one singular cause, but rather is often a result of many possible causes during development including malnutrition, and damage to the cerebrum such as from injury or disease. Physical abnormalities such as cleft plate and other anomalies that affect oral, pharyngeal, laryngeal structures or neuromuscular functions can be a cause of Expressive Language Disorder by interfering with the patients ability to communicate directly. Environmental problems during early childhood development, including inadequate stimulus, are risk factors as well.

== Symptoms ==
Expressive Language disorder is characterized by difficulty communicating in varied ways. Sometimes this manifests as below-average vocabulary skills for an individuals age or use of the incorrect tense when speaking. There can be difficulty forming complex sentences and remembering words. Difficulties are with expression, not with understanding as with Receptive Language Disorder

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis for expressive language disorder in children are usually marked by milestones markers of the child age grouping. A child can be diagnosed for expressive language disorder as early as two years old. Many pediatricians and speech and language pathologists look into all grounds of what may be causing speech delay. By the age of 2, children who are unable to use up to 270 one-word phrases and 25 different phonemes, not averaging 75 words per hour during free play, not able to talk in several two-to-three-word phrases with speech intelligibility or at least 65% ,and those who are unable to name common objects and pictures are predicted to most likely struggle and be diagnosed with expressive language disorder. In addition, it is also recommended to have a hearing test to diagnosis if the children&#x27;s ability to communicate is altered by hearing problems. Since age vary on diagnosis, treatment varies as well.

== Treatment ==
Treatment of expressive language disorder does not require medicine most of the time, but instead involves speech and language therapies. However, it is recommended to get a full physical check to rule out other possible disorders such as hearing loss. The recommended way to treat expressive language disorder is to work out a therapy plan by visiting a speech and language therapist. Some therapies may include use of toys, books, figures, and images to help improve the condition. In addition, parents could also aid children at home. For example, parents could have a small conversation with their children with slow, clear, and short words to gradually improve children&#x27;s condition. In this process, patience is key, and it is also important to not make the children stressed. Additionally, let children repeat a short sentence or say it in their own words could also be helpful. Early diagnosis and treatment is really important to treat expressive language disorder.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of this disease is shown to be associated with a class of different issues ranging from broad areas of development in a child&#x27;s life quality such as social relationships, mental health, literacy, academic abilities, community connections, etc. This is tied into the inability to properly communicate or express language due to the plethora of functional impairments that come with this disorder. Risk detection as well as the severity of the disease has also been linked to age and analyzed through the measurement of the ways these areas have been affected as the child reaches adolescence or adulthood. Additionally, an expressive language disorder that is not caused by any underlying diseases such as autism or brain tumors has been shown to be curable through means that do not involve direct forms of treatment such as medication. A variety of speech and language therapies which include the use of pictures, books, and much more have led to improvements in overall expression, encourages children to participate in many activities, helps them make more friends, and reduces the stress in parents and children. However, if the condition is not treated, it will cause the children to have a decreased performance in school and increased frustration in both the parents and children due to difficulties in communication. In order to tackle and navigate through these difficulties, it is highly recommended for parents to seek out a speech language pathologist and to incorporate a routine that aids the child&#x27;s condition at home such as an atmosphere where the encouragement for questions and active communications is endorsed. Activities such as reading to the child or the introductions to new words on objects or signs, would be good examples.

==Models of language production==

Willem Levelt outlined the currently accepted theory of speech production. Words are produced after the concept waiting to be produced is conceptualized, related words are selected, encoded and the sound waves of speech are produced.

==Association with language networks==
There is significant debate about whether specific language impairments, such as expressive language disorder, are caused by deficits in grammar or by a deficit in processing language information. However, an alternative hypothesis to the cause of SLIs has been posited, called the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis. The Procedural Deficit Hypothesis states that we can explain language impairments due to abnormal development of brain structures that are involved in procedural memory, our memories that remember how to perform different cognitive and motor tasks. The procedural memory system is associated with basal-ganglia circuits in the frontal lobe and further investigation of this particular hypothesis could aid in the development of a clinical neurological picture of what the underlying causes of SLI are.

== History ==

=== Scientific studies of speech and language ===
Some of the earliest discoveries in the field of neuroscience were related to the discovery that damage to certain areas of the brain related to impairments in language, such as the discovery of Wernicke&#x27;s area and Broca&#x27;s area. Lesions in these parts of the brain impair language comprehension and language production, respectively. Paul Broca was the first to note that the left hemisphere of the brain appeared to be localized for language function, particularly for right handed patients. Modern neuroscientific research has verified this, though language may be lateralized to the right hemisphere in some right-handed individuals.

===Developmental verbal dyspraxia===
In 1990, it was reported that the several generations of the KE family had developmental verbal dyspraxia and orofacial praxis that were inherited in a typical autosomal dominant pattern. Further analysis traced this inheritance pattern back to mutations in the FOXP2 genes. These studies have allowed scientists to begin to investigate how changes to one gene can alter human communication.

FOXP2 is the first gene that has been identified that is specifically linked to speech and language production. Mutant alleles of the normal FOXP2 gene have been found to be the cause of severe speech impairments.

===Specific language impairment===

Neuroimaging techniques, such as structural and functional MRI, found no significant differences between individuals with SLI and normal controls. However, more subtle and sophisticated techniques, such as voxel-based morphometry studies have allowed researchers to identify abnormalities in neural volume in areas of the brain associated with motor functions, such as the caudate nucleus, in the affected members of the KE family when compared to the unaffected family members. This volume reduction showed a high correlation between reduced volume and tests of oral praxis, supporting the idea that odd development of the caudate nucleus is related to the problems in motor control observed in the KE family.

Due to the vague nature of the diagnosis of expressive language disorder, there is little specific scientific research that we can currently locate. A larger body of research exists around neuroscientific studies with children diagnosed with a specific language impairment (SLI). fMRI studies have shown that children with SLI have a significantly smaller left hemispheric pars triangularis (Broca&#x27;s area) and asymmetry of dominance of language structures, as opposed to the more typical left hemisphere dominance. Scientists are beginning to elucidate differences in activation patterns in children with SLIs using neuroimaging techniques to capture brain activity while performing different cognitive tasks. A major observation is lack of left hemisphere lateralization in major language structures such as the inferior frontal gyrus-opercularis, inferior frontal gyrus-triangularis, supramarginal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. The same study reported hypoactivation and hyper activation of other brain regions - the supramarginal junction and anterior insula, respectively. Other in-depth imaging studies report finding previously undiagnosed lesions in the brains of children with well-characterized developmental language development. Together, these findings strongly suggest that language impairments are the result of an underlying neurological defect in an area of the brain related to language.

Studies looking at long-term outcomes for individuals with specific language impairments such as expressive language disorder track these individuals from childhood to adulthood. As Whitehouse and his colleagues suggest, &quot;When childhood language problems persist into adulthood, they can have far reaching consequences in terms of academic, social and vocational outcomes.&quot; These researchers found that children diagnosed with an SLI would have persistent problems with language and are more likely to pursue vocational training rather than university, thereby avoiding professions requiring high levels of literacy. A lower socioeconomic status was also noted by adults who were diagnosed with an SLI as a child. Whitehouse also reported that these adults had more difficulties in establishing friendships, most likely due to a decreased ability to express themselves socially.

==Current educational interventions for students with an SLI==
Specific language impairments are often secondary characteristics of other disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In these cases, issues with speech and language are often not treated specifically, but rather attention is given to the primary complaint. Due to the high correlation of an SLI with other disorders, it is difficult to tell the difference between &quot;pure SLI&quot; or language impairments due to the presence of another disorder.

<doc id="862913" wikidata="Q3570302" url="?curid=862913" title="X-O Manowar">
<text>X-O Manowar (Aric of Dacia) is a fictional superhero co-created by writers Jim Shooter and Steve Englehart, and artists Bob Layton and Barry Windsor-Smith.

The eponymous comic book series published by Valiant Comics has sold more than 8 million copies to date. &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; has also starred in a video game alongside Marvel Comics&#x27;s Iron Man. &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; comics have been translated into a number of languages including German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Norwegian, Filipino, Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese.

==Publication history==
===Valiant Comics===
&quot;X-O Manowar&quot; began as an original character by Valiant Comics with issue #1 with a cover date of February 1992. Less than a year after it began, with the Unity crossover and quality storytelling bringing attention to Valiant books, back issue prices rose dramatically due to limited early print runs. With comic book speculators buying multiple copies of each issue, sales reached as high as 800,000 copies for &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; #0 (August 1993) before dropping off. This original series ran for 68 issues before being canceled after the Sept. 1996 issue, of which only approximately 14,000 were printed.

Issues #1–4 of the original &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; series were reprinted in a trade paperback, &quot;X-O Manowar: Retribution&quot;, which sold over 150,000 copies. Issues #7 and #8 were reprinted as part of the &quot;Unity Saga&quot; trade paperbacks.

===Acclaim Comics era===
In 1996, Acclaim Entertainment bought Valiant for $65 million and restarted the series under the Acclaim Comics banner. The publication of the second series ceased (along with all of Acclaim&#x27;s non-core business) in 2002 due to Acclaim&#x27;s financial difficulties in their video game division.

===Valiant Entertainment===
In April 2008, the recently formed Valiant Entertainment released &quot;X-O Manowar: Birth&quot;, a deluxe hardcover collection collecting the first seven issues of &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;. The collection was digitally recolored and &quot;remastered&quot; from the original material and included a new story, &quot;The Rise of Lydia&quot;, by Bob Layton, one the title&#x27;s original artists. A press release from Valiantfans.com stated:

&quot;X-O Manowar: Birth&quot; (FEB084088), published by Valiant Entertainment, is solicited in the February Previews (Volume XVIII #2) and scheduled to arrive in comic book stores nationwide on April 30, 2008. This digitally re-colored and re-mastered special edition collects the full X-O Manowar origin story from issues #0–6 for the first time ever, and includes an all-new epic &quot;The Rise of Lydia&quot; story by comics legend Bob Layton and a new cover by Sean Chen! Aric of Dacia is a Visigoth barbarian captured by spider aliens and enslaved aboard their starship until he steals their ultimate weapon – the X-O Manowar armor. Aric returns to Earth only to find that 1600 years have past. Now the most primitive man on the planet wields the most technologically advanced weapon in existence! Features explosive art by Barry Windsor-Smith and Marvel EIC Joe Quesada and a story by legendary creators Bob Layton and Jim Shooter! The book is a full-color 192 page deluxe hardcover edition with a suggested retail price of $24.95.

Valiant Entertainment began publishing new comics based on the Valiant Comics universe of characters in May 2012, starting with a new &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; series by writer Robert Venditti and artist Cary Nord. The first issue sold through its initial print run of 45,000 copies. Valiant released a second printing of the issue with a variant cover by artist Arutro Lozzi.

In January 2017, a new X-O series was released, created by Matt Kindt.

===Characters===
====Shanhara (X-O Manowar Armor)====
According to legend, the sentient X-O Manowar armor known as Shanhara grew from a secret plant eons ago on the alien empire&#x27;s home world of Loa. During the Vine&#x27;s persecution at the hands of a mysterious race known as the Torment, it bonded with its first Vine Host, who went on to use its might to single-handedly repel the invasion force and win freedom for his people. The armor is living, composed of organics and exotic metals—a mutualistic symbiote, bonded to its host. For centuries, the Vine high priests searched for a wearer that could bear the power of Shanhara, but all such candidates were killed in the process. When Aric of Dacia attempted to escape the Vine captivity, he bonded with Shanhara as a last resort and was deemed worthy.

Aric and Shanhara share a unique relationship—one that continues even when they are separated. Shanhara can translate foreign and alien languages, tap into a world&#x27;s historical and geographical records, interface with complex forms of technology, and even heal life-threatening injuries and illnesses. Even though the bond between Aric and the armor is strong, it can be severed. Recently, the Harbinger Foundation teletechnopath Livewire was able to override the armor&#x27;s connection to Aric and wear Shanhara for a limited period. Despite its impact on earthly affairs, the armor&#x27;s true origin and purpose remain a mystery—one that the beings known as the Armor Hunters will soon expose.

===Original Valiant Comics version===
Aric of Dacia was a Visigoth born in the 5th century AD under Roman rule. As a young boy, Aric witnessed the slaughter of his parents at the hands of Roman soldiers. Henceforth, he dedicated himself to destroying the Roman oppressors, with the help of his Uncle, Alaric I.

Some years later, Aric took a Celtic slave, Deidre, to be his consort. He grew to love her, and worshipped her god, Lugh. One evening, he saw demons attacking members of his tribe. Aric attacked them, but was quickly subdued and taken aboard their alien spacecraft.

For the next seven years, Aric was held prisoner in the slave pens of the spacecraft. At a refuelling station several light years from Earth, he befriended a man known as the &quot;Map Giver&quot; who looked similar to Elvis Presley. The &quot;Map Giver&quot; used a discarded bone shard to carve a map into Aric&#x27;s palm that would lead him to the alien&#x27;s armory. Aric fought his way to the X-O Manowar class armor and donned the control ring. It later became clear that the &quot;manufacturing&quot; process of the X-O Manowar armor, which not only self-repaired, but also reproduced, involved the absorption of a sentient intelligence that then became the armor&#x27;s own sentience. With this living armor he was able to escape from the alien ship and return to Earth.
Due to time dilation, as Aric had been traveling at the speed of light, although only a few years had passed on board, sixteen centuries had passed on Earth. Aric thus found himself in the unfamiliar world of the 20th century. At first, Aric struggled to adjust to late-20th-century Earth. He encountered a number of Valiant Universe heroes, befriending some and alienating others. He eventually gained control of Orb Industries, a multi-national corporation formerly controlled by the Spider Aliens.

X-O Manowar played a major role in Valiant&#x27;s successful &quot;Unity&quot; crossover event. In this storyline, Aric chose not to help the other Valiant heroes defeat Mothergod (Erica Pierce), and instead built a small empire in the &quot;lost land&quot;. Eventually, he was tricked by Mothergod and his people were slaughtered. Aric was eviscerated by a cyborg-tyrannosaurus and became trapped within the X-O Manowar armor for ten years to heal.

Aric and the X-O Manowar armor were sent back to Aric&#x27;s own time by Solar at the end of &quot;Unity&quot;. Aric tried to convince his uncle, Alaric, to help him destroy the Romans. However, Alaric was concerned about the power that Aric had gained through the armor. Alaric and the Romans joined forces to fight Aric, but failed to defeat him.

In issue #28, the X-O Manowar armor (known as Shanhara) was destroyed. Solar went to Saturn to recover the armor left there, after defeating the alien he battled in &quot;Solar&quot; #7. This armor chose to remain with its deceased wearer, but had sprouted a seed, which Solar took. These seeds could be used to create a new Manowar armor, but only through the sacrifice of a sentient being. Aric&#x27;s friend, Paul Bouvier, who was dying from spider alien poison, consented to be sacrificed so that Aric could continue his battles with the Spider Aliens.

In the &quot;X-O Manowar Yearbook&quot;, it was explained how Gilad Anni-Padda, the Eternal Warrior, earned the eternal enmity of Aric. Gilad was rescued from bandits by Aric, but he betrayed the location of Aric&#x27;s Visigoth camp to Roman soldiers, whose attack led Deidre to miscarry Aric&#x27;s child. However, Gilad had betrayed the Visigoths as part of a conspiracy that led to the downfall of the Roman Empire and the rise of Alaric.

===Acclaim Comics version===
When Acclaim Entertainment acquired the comic series, X-O Manowar was significantly altered. The character was now a modern-day scientist named Donovan Wylie who wielded X-O armor, an ancient artifact owned by the United States government, having been captured from Nazi Germany in World War II.

In this series, the X-O Manowar armor is an artifact of unknown origin that has been worn by a myriad of warriors throughout history. It essentially gives its wearer indefinite power, but the armor slowly siphons the life essence of its wearer, damaging their mind and body. The armor attaches itself to the wearer&#x27;s nervous system and cannot be removed without killing the person wearing it. It can, however, be changed to its &quot;metal&quot; form at the wearer&#x27;s will, but the metal is permanently grafted onto the wearer&#x27;s chest (it is unknown if the armor will activate if grafted onto another part of the body).

===Valiant Entertainment version===
Born into battle, Aric of Dacia, heir to the throne of the Visigoth people, never knew peace. Raised under the oppressive thumb of the Roman Empire in 5th century Europe, his entire life was a never-ending series of campaigns against Rome, until a far more terrifying enemy came into play: the brutal race and alien colonizers known as the Vine. Abducted during a midnight scouting raid and taken to the far reaches of space, Aric and his fellow Visigoth captives lived their lives as slaves to the Vine, with no hope of escape.

After several years of captivity aboard a Vine colony ship, Aric led a revolt against his alien captors, storming the hallowed temple of the Vine and stealing their most powerful relic, Shanhara, the sentient X-O Manowar armor. Aric bonded with the armor—the first being in living memory to survive the process—and turned the Vine&#x27;s most powerful weapon against them. But a crushing counterattack by the Vine left many of Aric&#x27;s allies dead or dying. Inexperienced with the armor himself, Aric barely escaped the Vine fleet before rocketing back to Earth.

Upon his return, Aric learned that due to the effects of time dilation, 1,600 years have passed since his abduction and he was now stranded in the 21st century. Distraught by the loss of his family and people, Aric secluded himself in the Peruvian jungle, but the Vine were unwilling to leave their most sacred relic in human hands. Vine legend told that their greatest champion would one day wear the armor; news of a human controlling the suit could spell massive civil unrest for their empire.

To recover it, covert Vine agents called &quot;plantings&quot;, left on Earth hundreds of years ago and modified to appear human, recruited the super-spy Ninjak to kill Aric and return the armor. But with the help of Alexander Dorian, Aric turned Ninjak against his alien masters and led an attack on the Vine&#x27;s secret headquarters inside Britain&#x27;s MI-6, virtually eliminating the plantings&#x27; operations in England.

The Vine responded with a full-force invasion, one that proved to be no match for the X-O Manowar armor. However, Aric realized that there would be no peace with the Vine until they were destroyed. Commandeering a Vine ship, Aric mounted a one-man invasion of the alien race&#x27;s homeworld, Loam, toppling the empire and freeing thousands in the process, including a population of enslaved Visigoths descended from Aric&#x27;s own people.

Returning to Earth with his new kinsmen in tow, Aric decided to reestablish an ancestral Visigoth homeland in its present-day location within Romania, a decision that quickly drew the ire of the neighboring Russian government. After warding off a series of coordinated military strikes, Aric was faced with his greatest threat yet, the super-team known as Unity.

Aric&#x27;s defense of Dacia did not go to plan. He was beaten by Toyo Harada, stripped of his armor, and taken into custody by the United States Military Reconnaissance Outpost (M.E.R.O.), a covert government agency that monitors and engages alien threats. In exchange for asylum for him and his people, Aric, now reunited with the X-O Manowar armor, works as an agent of M.E.R.O., protecting American interests on and above the Earth.

<doc id="862915" wikidata="Q6884011" url="?curid=862915" title="Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder">
<text>Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder (DSM-IV 315.32) is a communication disorder in which both the receptive and expressive areas of communication may be affected in any degree, from mild to severe. Children with this disorder have difficulty understanding words and sentences. This impairment is classified by deficiencies in expressive and receptive language development that is not attributed to sensory deficits, nonverbal intellectual deficits, a neurological condition, environmental deprivation or psychiatric impairments. Research illustrates that 2% to 4% of five year olds have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This distinction is made when children have issues in expressive language skills, the production of language, and when children also have issues in receptive language skills, the understanding of language. Those with mixed receptive-language disorder have a normal left-right anatomical asymmetry of the planum temporale and parietale. This is attributed to a reduced left hemisphere functional specialization for language. Taken from a measure of cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in phonemic discrimination tasks, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder do not exhibit the expected predominant left hemisphere activation. Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is also known as receptive-expressive language impairment (RELI) or receptive language disorder.

==Classification==
If assessed on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, for instance, symptoms of mixed receptive-expressive language disorder may show as relatively low scores for Information, Vocabulary and Comprehension (perhaps below the 25th percentile). If a person has difficulty with specific types of concepts, for example spatial terms, such as &#x27;over&#x27;, &#x27;under&#x27;, &#x27;here&#x27; and &#x27;there&#x27;, they may also have difficulties with arithmetic, understanding word problems and instructions, or difficulties using words at all.
They may also have a more general problem with words or sentences, both comprehension and orally. Some children will have issues with pragmatics – the use of language in social contexts as well; and therefore, will have difficulty with inferring meaning. Furthermore, they have severe impairment of spontaneous language production and for this reason, they have difficulty in formulating questions. Generally, children will have trouble with morphosyntax, which is word inflections. These children have difficulty understanding and applying grammatical rules, such as endings that mark verb tenses (e.g. -&quot;ed&quot;), third-person singular verbs (e.g. I &quot;think&quot;, he &quot;thinks&quot;), plurals (e.g. -&quot;s&quot;), auxiliary verbs that denote tenses (e.g. &quot;was&quot; running, &quot;is&quot; running), and with determiners (&quot;the, a&quot;). Moreover, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorders have deficits in completing two cognitive operations at the same time and learning new words or morphemes under time pressure or when processing demands are high. These children also have auditory processing deficits in which they process auditory information at a slower rate and as a result, require more time for processing.

==Presentation==
===Related disorders===
Studies show that low receptive and expressive language at young ages was correlated to increased autism symptom severity in children in their early school years. Below is a chart depicting language deficits of children on the autistic spectrum. This table indicates the lower levels of language processing, receptive/expressive disorders, which is more severe in children with autism. When autistic children speak, they are often difficult to understand, their language is sparse and dysfluent, they speak in single, uninflected words or short phrases, and their supply of words is severely depleted. This leads to limited vocabulary while also having deficits in verbal short-term memory.

==Management==
Children who demonstrate deficiencies early in their speech and language development are at risk for continued speech and language issues throughout later childhood. Similarly, even if these speech and language problems have been resolved, children with early language delay are more at risk for difficulties in phonological awareness, reading, and writing throughout their lives. Children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder are often likely to have long-term implications for language development, literacy, behavior, social development, and even mental health problems. If suspected of having a mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, treatment is available from a speech therapist or pathologist. Most treatments are short term, and rely upon accommodations made within the environment, in order to minimize interfering with work or school. Programs that involve intervention planning that link verbal short-term memory with visual/nonverbal information may be helpful for these children. In addition, approaches such as parent training for language stimulation and monitoring language through the &quot;watch and see&quot; method are recommended. The watch-and-see technique advises children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder who come from stable, middle-class homes without any other behavioral, medical, or hearing problems should be vigilantly monitored rather than receive intervention. It is often the case that children do not meet the eligibility criteria established through a comprehensive oral language evaluation; and as a result, are not best suited for early intervention programs and require a different approach besides the &quot;one size fits all&quot; model.

<doc id="862920" wikidata="Q5314182" url="?curid=862920" title="Dunbeath Castle">
<text>Dunbeath Castle is located on the east coast of Caithness, south of Dunbeath, in northern Scotland. Although a castle has stood here since the 15th century, the present building is of mainly 17th-century origin, with 19th-century extensions. The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==History==
A castle is first recorded on the rocky peninsula at Dunbeath in 1428, when the lands belonged to the Earl of Caithness. The first recorded laird was Alexander Sutherland. It later became the property of the Clan Sinclair through the marriage of the daughter of Alexander Sutherland to William Sinclair (1410–1484), the first Sinclair Earl of Caithness. The Sinclairs replaced the earlier structure with a four-storey tower house in 1620.

After control for some time (during an unspecified period) by Lord Forbes of Geanies, then baron of Dunbeath, the property was reacquired by John Sinclair circa 1624. He is likely the owner &quot;who extensively remodelled Dunbeath castle and built the upper storeys in the 1630s&quot;.

In March 1650, Dunbeath was attacked by the Royalist forces of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Sir John Sinclair rode to Edinburgh to warn of Montrose&#x27;s arrival, leaving his wife Catherine Fraser to defend Dunbeath against Sir John Hurry. She soon surrendered, and a Royalist garrison was installed. Montrose was defeated in April at the Battle of Carbisdale, and the opposition forces, under David Leslie, recaptured the castle.

The castle was extensively remodelled in the 17th century by Sir William Sinclair, and again in 1853 and 1881, when David Bryce was the architect. The major modification was making the &quot;northern front of the castle symmetrical and [laying] out an approach down a three-quarter-mile-long, arrow-straight, tree-lined drive&quot;.

From 1894 to 1945, the castle was owned by Vice-Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair. In that year, after 325 years of occupation by the Sinclair Family, the castle was sold to Bertram Currie. In 1967 it was sold again to Harry Blythe and Helen (Sinclaire) Blythe. The castle remained in their possession until 1976 when it was sold to Ray Stanton Avery. In 1997 the castle was sold to Stuart Wyndham Murray-Threipland and his wife. The property was listed for sale again in 2023, including 20 estate houses and cottages. At the time, the 13 bedroom, nine bathroom, castle remained a private home; only the gardens were open to the public, by appointment.

The Castle and grounds were sold in 2024 for £25,000,000.00.
The new owner of Dunbeath Castle is a company called Dunbeath Estates Limited, whose sole director is Don Macleod. The identity of the buyer was hidden through a legal loophole involving trusts and company filings. 


==The castle==

The oldest part of the castle lies at the south-west corner, and dates largely from the 17th century. More modern additions have been made to the north and east, in a Scots Baronial style to match the earlier building. The interiors are much altered. The defensive site was enhanced by a dry ditch on the landward side, which cuts across the narrow promontory on which the castle stands.

==In popular culture==
The 2023 Hindi movie &quot;Neeyat&quot; was filmed at Dunbeath.

<doc id="862930" wikidata="Q288694" url="?curid=862930" title="Ballot (automobile)">
<text>Ballot was a French manufacturer, initially of engines, that also made automobiles between 1919 and 1932. Ernest Ballot became well known as a designer of reliable engines. He helped Ettore Bugatti in developing his first engines.

== Origins ==
Ernest Ballot and Julien Faivre founded their company at the Boulevard Brune in south-central Paris in 1905.Ernest Ballot&#x27;s brother Albert was also involved early in the company&#x27;s life. Ernest Ballot was a former naval officer, which explains the &quot;anchor&quot; that featured in the badges on the cars.

Before World War I the factory concentrated on marine and industrial engines, and from 1910 or 1911 they also offered automobile engines.

The company was re-founded as Etablissements Ballot SA in 1910.

== Sporting successes ==

There is little sign that Ernest Ballot himself took much interest in automobiles until December 1918. That was the month in which he had a significant conversation with René Thomas, a leading racing driver who had won the 1914 Indianapolis 500 race driving a Delage. Ballot was persuaded to build four 4.8-litre cars that would carry the &quot;Ballot&quot; name and compete in the forthcoming Indianapolis 500 race, scheduled for 30 May 1919. Time seemed very short, but Ballot lost no time, notably recruiting the Swiss born engineer Ernest Henry who had already worked on preparing Peugeot cars for their successful participation in the 1914 Indianapolis 500 race. Ballot&#x27;s cars competed in the 1919 race, two of them finishing in 4th and 11th places. A Ballot vehicle driven by René Thomas also finished second in the 1919 Targa Florio. Ballot was sufficiently encouraged to return the next year, and in the 1920 Indianapolis 500 race a Ballot driven by René Thomas finished in second place: Ballots also took fifth and seventh places. Ralph DePalma, an American national champion and winner of the 1915 Indianapolis 500, drove a Ballot to win the 1920 Elgin Trophy.
More successes followed, on both sides of the Atlantic. DePalma finished second in the 1921 French Grand Prix and French driver Jules Goux finished third. Goux went on to win the inaugural Italian Grand Prix at Brescia, Italy in 1921, driving a Ballot. Second place was taken by the team leader Jean Chassagne on a sister car; a year before, in 1920 Chassagne made the fastest BARC lap of the year at Brooklands on a 4.9-litre Ballot, coming again second. A Ballot with a straight-eight-cylinder 4.9-litre engine competed in the 1921 French Grand Prix.

== Road cars ==

As well as racing engines, the company made a range of road engines which were fitted to their own production cars.

The first of Ballot&#x27;s own road cars was the 1921 2-litre Ballot 2-litre sports tourer. In 1923 the Ballot 2 LT and a sport version, Ballot 2 LTS followed.By the time of the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924, Ballot was established in the market place as a producer of expensive road going cars with spectacular performance. The 2-litre sports tourer again appeared on the manufacturer&#x27;s stand at the show. The car still used a four cylinder overhead camshaft 1,994 cc engine, and it sat on a wheelbase. It was priced, in bare chassis form, at 33,000 francs: Ballot also listed a &quot;Torpedo&quot; bodied version at 46,000 francs.

From 1927, eight-cylinder engines were used.

== Final chapter ==

In 1931 the company was taken over by Hispano-Suiza. Swift decline followed: the last model was practically a Hispano-Suiza, and only the chassis was provided by Ballot. Ballot closed down in 1932.

== Main models ==
* 2LS: sports car, 4-cylinder 1944 cc, twin-overhead-camshaft, 4-valves-per-cylinder engine
* 2LT: tourer, single-cam variant of the 2LS
* 2LTS: variant of the 2LT, with higher-tuned engine
* RH: introduced in 1927 with 8-cylinder, single-overhead-cam, 2874 cc engine
* RH3: 1929–1932, RH with 3049 cc engine.
* HS26: model introduced after the Hispano-Suiza takeover, also known as the Hispano-Suiza Junior, 4580 cc six-cylinder engine
