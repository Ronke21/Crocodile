<text>Stanwell Park is a coastal village and northern suburb of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It is the northernmost point of the Illawarra coastal strip and lies south of Sydney&#x27;s Royal National Park. It is situated in a small valley between Bald Hill to the north, Stanwell Tops to the west and Mount Mitchell to the south. It has two lagoons from the village&#x27;s two creeks, Stanwell and Hargrave Creeks, and a beach running between headlands. Stanwell Park and the surrounding suburbs are colloquially referred to by its postcode 2508.

==History==

Stanwell Park was the name given to the farm established on the grant given to Matthew John Gibbons in 1824. He was given most of the area called &quot;Little Bulli&quot; which included present-day Stanwell Park and Coalcliff. The whole of Northern Illawarra went under the Aboriginal name Bulli. Bulli remains the name of an Illawarra suburb further south of Stanwell Park.

The area was originally inhabited by the Wodiwodi Aboriginal clan of the Tharawal people. It was traversed by 3 shipwrecked sailors in an epic journey of survival along hundreds of miles of coastline until rescued at Wattamolla, north of Stanwell Park. Two of their companions were unable to negotiate the Coal Cliffs where the Sea Cliff Bridge is today, and their remains were found by explorer George Bass, who also reported on the rich coal seam apparent in the cliffs.

Mr Gibbons installed a convict, John Paid, to manage the Stanwell Park farm. Paid however used the out-of-the-way valley as a hideout for a gang of bushrangers he formed. He adopted the name of Wolloo Jack and his gang terrorised the Bargo to Liverpool area until he and others of the gang were sent to the gallows in 1829.

When Governor Lachlan Macquarie visited Stanwell Park in 1822 he remarked that: &quot;On our arrival at the summit of the mountain, we were gratified with a very magnificent bird&#x27;s eye view of the ocean, the 5 Islands, and of the greater part of the low country of Illawarra ... After feasting our eyes with this grand prospect, we commenced descending the mountain ... The whole face ... is clothed with the largest and finest forest trees I have ever seen in the colony.&quot;

The valley continued to attract notable people: Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, one of Australia&#x27;s best-known explorers built the first house at Stanwell Park; Supreme Court Judge John Fletcher Hargrave later owned and holidayed in the area, his inheritance coming to Lawrence Hargrave, one of the world&#x27;s most important aviation pioneers of the 1890s in the lead-up to powered man flight. He performed his most important experiments at Stanwell Park. Lawrence Hargrave moved to Hillcrest House, having inherited it from his brother Ralph Hargrave, in 1893. It is on the road up to the Stanwell Park railway station.

The land developer, Henry Halloran, bought 240 acres of land at Stanwell Park, some of which was resumed by the government for public recreation purposes. He sub-divided the remaining land into building allotments, which he sold to the public from around 1907 to around 1930. The public school was established in 1917.

One of the village&#x27;s most famous attractions is the curved railway viaduct over Stanwell Creek Gorge. It was built in the 1910s when problems with the old railway route forced the construction of a new track higher up the mountainside. At 65 m above the creek bed, surrounded by profuse rainforest vegetation and containing an estimated five million bricks, it is the largest railway viaduct in Australia.

In the 1980s a fatal accident occurred on the railway due to cliff erosion.

Now &quot;Stanwell&quot;, or &quot;The Park&quot;, is home to about 1400 people, a dormitory suburb for commuters to the nearby cities of Sydney and Wollongong, and a popular tourist destination.

==Heritage listings==
Stanwell Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Illawarra railway, 56.727 km: Stanwell Creek railway viaduct

==Population==
In the , there were 1,532 people in Stanwell Park. 81.3% of people were born in Australia and 89.4% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 50.5%, Catholic 19.2% and Anglican 11.9%.

==Activities==

The village has a small area of shops and an art gallery on Lawrence Hargrave Drive. Bushwalking is possible on several tracks, most notably the Wodi Wodi Track that climbs Mount Mitchell from the station, and a rather degraded track to Stanwell Tops Lookout, also from the station.

Stanwell Park is famous for paragliding and hang gliding activities from Bald Hill down to its beach, which lies nested between high sea cliffs. Rock climbing can be done at Stanwell Tops which offers a view over the village. A feature is the beach with its two lagoons. The Helensburgh-Stanwell Park Surf Life Saving Club (SLSC) offers beach safety and beach activities such as the Nippers on Sundays in summertime. Stanwell Park Arts Theatre, or S.P.A.T (formally Stanwell Park Amateur Theatre) was founded in the early 1970s by Lauren Mitsak, Pam Beckett and others. Joy Weidersatz was the first director. The annual Christmas pantomime is popular, though S.P.A.T puts on all types of shows, including Shakespeare, Satire, musicals, theatre restaurant-style shows, revues, etc.

Stanwell Park is serviced by Stanwell Park railway station on the South Coast railway line. The railway bends around the village and crosses Stanwell Creek on a historic brick viaduct.

Bald Hill, at the apex of Lawrence Hargrave Drive, takes in the views of the Northern Illawarra and the escarpment. Whale watching, when in season, captivates many a Sydney day-tripper. The spot is also a notable location for DX radio communication due to its southern and eastern vistas.

==Attractions==

Symbio Wildlife Park is located on Lawrence Hargrave Drive, near the intersection with the Old Princes Highway, at Stanwell Tops. There are over 1000 native, exotic and farmyard animals in all. It has appeared in a Delta Goodrem music video and several television documentaries and is scheduled to appear in the upcoming film . The gardens includes a café, souvenir shop, and free swimming pools and gas barbecues.

Just east of the Symbio Wildlife Gardens, on Lawrence Hargrave Drive, is a turnoff that leads to Sri Venkateswara Hindu Temple. Australia&#x27;s first Hindu Temple opened on 30 June 1985. It is located in Temple Street on a site. This site was chosen because it fitted the Hindu requirements of a peaceful spot, close to water, elevated, in the bush and on virgin soil. Indian architect Janakiramana Sthapati designed the temple, his family have been temple architects since the sixth century.

At Bald Hill is Intabane Mansion, a prominent feature visible from the valley below with a &#x27;witches hat roof&#x27;, used as an army lookout during World War II. It was originally built in 1917 for the sum of 3000 pounds and became a guest house between the wars. 
Another attraction is Kelly&#x27;s Falls, which includes a viewing platform.

Walking tracks include the Stanwell Tops lookout track which runs from Stanwell Park train station up the hillside to the Peace Garden, where there are historic Aboriginal carvings on the trees, and to the Stanwell Tops Lookout. Another track, the Wodi Wodi, Bullock, or Mount Mitchell Track, leads from the former track down to Stanwell Creek, around the viaduct and up Mount Mitchell, then down to the railway and a carpark on Lawrence Hargrave Drive. On the Wodi Wodi track, an aboriginal drawing of a whale can be seen, as well as several middens. Access to Bald Hill from Stanwell Park is available from a track on Chellow Dene Avenue, leading to the top of the hill.

==Notable residents==

<doc id="846291" wikidata="Q1240452" url="?curid=846291" title="Donald Stewart (Alabama politician)">
<text>Donald Wilbur Stewart (born February 8, 1940) is a former American lawyer who was a United States Senator from Alabama from 1978 to 1981. He succeeded Maryon Pittman Allen and was succeeded by Jeremiah Denton. Prior to Stewart&#x27;s time in the Senate, he served in the Alabama Senate and the Alabama House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==

Stewart was born in Munford, Alabama, and received his early education there and in Anniston. He attended the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, both as an undergraduate and in law school. At the university, he ran a successful campaign for student body president, becoming one of the few to defeat &quot;the Machine&quot; that controls university student politics. He received his law degree in 1965 and subsequently served briefly in the United States Army.

==Political career==
From 1967 to 1970 Stewart was a United States magistrate judge in the Northern District of Alabama. In 1970, he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives and served in that position until 1974, when he was elected to the Alabama State Senate, where he served until 1978. In the state legislature he developed a reputation for being knowledgeable and aggressive. Among the initiatives he pursued was an effort to reform the Alabama Public Service Commission.

===1978 campaign===
Stewart was elected as a Democrat to fill the unexpired U.S. Senate term of James B. Allen, who died in office, and whose seat was held in the interim by Allen&#x27;s widow, Maryon Pittman Allen. After he defeated Mrs. Allen in the primary, Stewart faced the Republican nominee, former Congressman James D. Martin, who like James Allen was a native of Gadsden. Mrs. Allen had called Stewart &quot;a flaming liberal&quot;, and her brother, James Pittman, thereafter formed the group &quot;Conservative Democrats for Martin.&quot; Stewart specifically challenged Martin&#x27;s record when he had served a term in the House from 1965 to 1967. Martin challenged Stewart&#x27;s commitment to the right-to-work provision of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. In his campaign against Stewart, Martin made negative allusions to Stewart&#x27;s disclosure that in 1958, when he was eighteen, he had undergone treatment for a nervous breakdown. Stewart defeated Martin, 401,852 (55%) to 316,170 (43%).

===U.S. Senate===
Stewart took office on November 8, 1978. In his first year as a U.S. senator, he compiled a near-perfect attendance record, introduced twelve bills and was co-sponsor of eighty others. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd appointed him to a deputy whip position, making him the only freshman Senator to serve in party leadership in the 96th Congress.

===1980 defeat===
Stewart failed to gain reelection to the Senate in 1980, losing the Democratic primary to state Public Service Commissioner Jim Folsom, Jr. Folsom went on to lose narrowly to Republican Jeremiah Denton in the general election. Stewart remained in the Senate until January 2, 1981, when he resigned one day before his term expired.

==Post-Senate career==
Stewart practices law in Alabama. He was lead attorney on a class action lawsuit against agricultural biotech giant Monsanto Company for PCB dumping in his hometown of Anniston. The case garnered national attention, including coverage by CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. As of 2002, the company had paid out as much as $160 million against various plaintiffs in Alabama, including those represented by Stewart.

He also serves on the advisory board of the University of Alabama&#x27;s Blackburn Institute.

<doc id="846297" wikidata="Q442942" url="?curid=846297" title="Miho Hatori">
<text>is a Japanese singer, songwriter, and musician. She is best known as a solo artist, co-founder of New York City band Cibo Matto, and as the first person to provide the voice of Noodle in the virtual band Gorillaz, as well as for her work with the Beastie Boys, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Smokey Hormel, John Zorn, and many more.

==Biography==
Hatori expressed an early interest in music while growing up in Japan. She worked at used record shop Flash Disc Ranch in Shimokitazawa, Tokyo, where she was exposed to many styles of music and sometimes performed as a club DJ. Her earliest history in a music project dates to 1991 when she joined hip hop group Kimidori; she left the group in 1992.

Hatori moved to New York City in 1993 to study art; she quickly met Yuka Honda through performing together in punk/noise band Laito Lychee, a project that featured Hatori on vocals and violin played through distortion effects pedals. Hatori and Honda co-founded Cibo Matto in 1994 and released their debut album &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; in 1996. The duo formation expanded to include Sean Lennon and Timo Ellis on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Super Relax&quot; EP, and &quot;unofficial&quot; fifth member Duma Love appeared on their second full-length, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Stereo ★ Type A&quot;. Cibo Matto broke up in 2001, but came back with a reunion tour in 2011. They released a third and final follow-up album &quot;Hotel Valentine&quot; on February 14, 2014.

Hatori worked with her Cibo Matto collaborators outside of the band, contributing to Sean Lennon&#x27;s solo album &quot;Into the Sun&quot;, as well as to his scores for the independent films &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead&quot; and &quot;Alter Egos&quot;; she also appears on Yuka Honda&#x27;s solo album &quot;Eucademix&quot;.

While Cibo Matto was touring with Beck, Hatori and Beck guitarist Smokey Hormel discovered a shared love of bossa nova and samba, which eventually resulted in their Brazilian-styled musical project Smokey &amp; Miho. Other artists Hatori has worked with include Handsome Boy Modeling School (on the album &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot;), DJ Towa Tei, Stephin Merritt&#x27;s The 6ths, The Baldwin Brothers, Beastie Boys, Blackalicious, Peter Daily, Greg Kurstin, Forró in the Dark, John Zorn, The Incredible Moses Leroy, Patrick Higgins, and Smokey Hormel.

Miho performs solo under her own name and various monikers. Her first solo album, &quot;Ecdysis&quot;, was released in Japan in 2005, coming two years later to the American and European markets. In 2018, she released &quot;Amazon To LeFrak&quot; as New Optimism and &quot;Sequence&quot; as Miss Information.

Her 2021 release, &quot;Between Isekai and Slice of Life&quot;, was inspired by both Édouard Glissant and &quot;isekai&quot; and &quot;slice of life&quot; anime––specifically in &quot;Demon Slayer&quot;, which she watched in 2020 during New York City&#x27;s COVID-19 stay-at-home order.

<doc id="846298" wikidata="Q770115" url="?curid=846298" title="Border Protection Corps">
<text>The Border Protection Corps () was a military formation of the Second Polish Republic that was created in 1924 to defend the country&#x27;s eastern borders against armed Soviet incursions and local bandits. Other borders were under the jurisdiction of a separate, regular Border Guard state security agency.

Though the corps was part of the Polish Army, it was commanded directly by the Ministry of Internal Affairs rather than the Ministry of Military Affairs. It consisted of elite soldiers from all parts of Poland. Initially &quot;KOP&quot; comprised 6 brigades and 5 regiments, each guarding part of the borders with the Soviet Union. &quot;KOP&quot; ceased to exist with the fall of Poland in September 1939. In 1940, some of its former officers formed an underground armed resistance organization fighting against the German occupiers, the Komenda Obrońców Polski.

==History==

=== Founding ===
After the Polish–Soviet War, the Polish eastern frontier was stretched from the border with Latvia to the north, to the Prut river and Romanian border to the south. Although the peace treaty had been signed, the eastern border of Poland was insecure. Armed bands of saboteurs were crossing the border on a daily basis and the weak police forces in the area could not cope with the problem. In 1924 the town of Stołpce located 20 kilometres from the border was seized by Soviet saboteurs and pillaged. Polish Minister of War Affairs, Władysław Sikorski, decided that the regular police could not cope with the problem and suggested that the control of the border be handed over to the Polish Army.

In one of the reports it was stated that &quot;the police waits for the army, while the army waits for the police&quot;. To prevent such problems in the future it was decided to combine the police with the army. On August 8, the Council of Ministers decided that a special militarised border police be created for the defence of the eastern frontier. It also granted significant amounts of money for construction of fortified barracks and police stations in the area. Until November of the same year more than 3,5 million zlotys were spent on that purpose. On September 17, 1924, the new formation was officially created under the name of Border Defence Corps.

In November 1924 the three first brigades of KOP arrived to the eastern border of Poland, in the areas of Volhynia and Polesie. In April 1925 additional two brigades took over the frontier in Southern Polesie and Galicia. Finally, in March 1926 the sixth brigade took over the border with Lithuania and Latvia. Altogether the forces of KOP included 24 battalions of infantry and 20 squadrons of cavalry.

The soldiers of KOP were trained to combine the tactics of the army, police forces and border guards. They guarded the borders actively, not only by patrols, but also through reconnaissance, ambushes, provocation and intelligence gathering. During the first year of its existence, the KOP arrested more than 5,000 people trying to cross the border illegally. In addition, 89 armed skirmishes were fought, mainly against the bandits from the Soviet Union. To maintain the high morale and skills, the soldiers allowed into the KOP were carefully examined. Most of them were inhabitants of western voivodships, many of them were of German nationality. All volunteers had to gather experience in the regular units of the Polish Army before they were allowed in.

=== Piłsudski&#x27;s reforms (1929–35) ===
In July 1929, the Border Defence Corps was reorganised. Six additional regiments were created, and all the existing units were renamed. Each brigade was attached to part of the Polish border which was further divided into battalion areas organised around small forts along the border. In turn, each of the battalions commanded several smaller strongholds and outposts organised by companies. All the rear troops (including the engineers, artillery and cavalry) formed the second line of the defence and were to be used as a mobile reserve. The brigades were given new names, after the area they were stationed in:

# Grodno
# Wilno
# Nowogródek
# Polesie
# Wołyń
# Podole

The newly created regiments were named as follows:

# Głębokie
# Wołożyn
# Wilejka
# Suwałki
# Sarny
# Czortków

=== Modernisation (1937–39) ===
In early 1937 the organisation was modified. Wilno, Nowogródek and Wołyń brigades were disbanded and reorganised into three regiments:
# Wilno
# Snów
# Zdołbunów

&quot;Czortków&quot; regiment was also disbanded and split onto two separate battalions (&quot;Wilejka&quot; and &quot;Berezwecz&quot;). Also, several new units were created and were pressed into the existing structure. After 1937 the KOP had 3 brigade headquarters and 7 regiments. It was composed of 32 battalions of infantry and 21 squadrons of cavalry. As the war was nearing and the crisis in Czechoslovakia exposed the Polish southern border to enemy threat, in 1939 two additional regiments were created. Those were 1st and 2nd KOP Infantry Regiments &quot;Karpaty&quot;, each composed of two battalions of infantry (named &quot;Skole&quot;, &quot;Delatyn&quot;, &quot;Komańcza&quot; and &quot;Dukla&quot;). Soon three additional mountain infantry brigades were formed (&quot;Sanok&quot;, &quot;Nowy Sącz&quot;, &quot;Sucha&quot;) as well as the area command in Jasło.

In March KOP reached the peak of its strength. However, soon the formation started to be stripped of various units sent to the western border. At first four infantry battalions and most of the artillery were sent to Łódź area. Soon they were joined by the KOP cavalry regiment. In April three additional battalions were sent to the West and in May yet another battalion was sent to Hel, Poland. Although most of the units were later reconstructed at the eastern border, their combat value was much lower. The recruits lacked experience and training and the units of KOP were deprived of almost all heavy weaponry.

On August 30 the KOP was formally mobilised. General Wilhelm Orlik-Rückemann became its commander. According to the Polish plans for the forthcoming war, the KOP was to become the backbone of reserve divisions formed behind the Polish lines.

===September Campaign===
In the fight against the German invasion, KOP units took part among other battles in the battle of Węgierska Górka. After Soviet invasion on 17 September, Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza which had 25 battalions were unable to defend the eastern border and were further ordered by Edward Rydz-Śmigły to fall back and not to engage the Soviets. This however did not prevent some clashes and small battles, including Battle of Szack (28 September) and Battle of Wytyczno (1 October).

<text>Joseph Lister Hill (December 27, 1894 – December 20, 1984) was an American attorney and Democratic Party politician who represented Alabama in the United States House of Representatives from 1923 to 1938 and the United States Senate from 1938 to 1969.

As Senator, Hill was active on health-related issues and served as Senate Majority Whip from 1941 to 1947. He also served as the Chair of the Senate Committee on Labor from 1955 to 1969. At the time of his retirement, Hill was the fourth-most senior Senator. Hill was succeeded by fellow Democrat James Allen.

==Early years==
Hill was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 27, 1894 along with his twin sister, Amelie, to the surgeon Dr. Luther Leonidas Hill Jr. and his wife Lilly. Lister Hill was named after Dr. Joseph Lister, the father of antiseptic surgery. Following his graduation from the Starke University School in Montgomery, he entered the University of Alabama at the age of sixteen and graduated four years later with a BA and law degree and a Phi Beta Kappa key. While a student at the University of Alabama, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He also founded the Student Government Association (SGA) and was its first president, the Jasons Senior Men&#x27;s Honorary (which the university ceased recognizing in 1976 for its all-male policy, but which still taps forty men each spring on the Franklin Mound), and The Machine (the local chapter of Theta Nu Epsilon).

He also studied law at the University of Michigan Law School at Ann Arbor, Michigan, and at Columbia Law School in New York City. He was admitted to the Alabama bar in 1916 and commenced practice in Montgomery and also served as the president of the Montgomery Board of Education from 1917 to 1922.

==Political life==
Hill was elected on August 14, 1923, as U.S. representative from Alabama&#x27;s 2nd congressional district to fill the vacancy created by the death of John R. Tyson. He served as Chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs. On January 10, 1938, Hill was appointed to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Dixie Bibb Graves for the term ending January 3, 1939; he was subsequently elected on April 26, 1938 to fill the remaining months of the term.

During World War II, Hill supported the interventionist side of America&#x27;s foreign policy arguments and took an outspokenly &quot;pro-British&quot; stance, both speaking and voting in favor of the Lend-Lease program. On October 23, 1941 he voted in favor of supplemental lend-lease funding to help the British Army. On November 7, 1941 he voted in favor of legislation to amend several sections of the neutrality acts which was intended to make it easier for the United States to provide direct military aid to the United Kingdom during World War II. The British privately described him as &quot;reliably pro-British.&quot; He was elected to a full term in November 1938 and re-elected in 1944, 1950, 1956, and 1962. He did not seek re-election in 1968 and retired in January 1969.
A moderate-to-liberal populist Democrat, Hill distinguished himself in a number of fields, but was best known for the Hospital and Health Center Construction Act of 1946, better known as the Hill-Burton Act. He also sponsored the Hill-Harris Act of 1963, providing for assistance in constructing facilities for the intellectually disabled and mentally ill. Additionally, he was recognized as the most instrumental man in Congress in gaining greatly increased support for medical research at the nation&#x27;s medical schools and other research institution.

He sponsored other important legislation, including the Rural Telephone Act, the Rural Housing Act, the Vocational Education Act, and the National Defense Education Act of 1958. &quot;Hill also used his position and his persistence in improving conditions in rural areas to allot federal funds for rural libraries. For a decade, he worked to provide library service to those with no or inadequate facilities&quot; and was instrumental in passing the Library Services Act which ensured federal funding to support development of libraries in rural areas and dramatically changed the landscape of libraries in terms of viability, sustainability, and quality.

In 1954, Hill signed &quot;The Southern Manifesto&quot; condemning the Supreme Court&#x27;s 9–0 decision in &quot;Brown vs Board of Education&quot; ordering school desegregation, but remained a close friend of Supreme Court Justice and fellow Alabamian Hugo Black who voted for the decision. In 1957, he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He also voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In 1956 he was honored by the American Library Association for his support of the Library Services Act.

However, Hill was as much a national figure as a representative of Alabama and the South. During his long years in the Congress, he would, from time to time, break with his southern colleagues to follow his own conscience. For example, in opposition to most southerners in the Congress, he favored federal control of offshore oil, with revenue to be earmarked for education.

Hill was the Senate Majority Whip from 1941 to 1947. He was Chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee, which handled important legislation on veterans education, health, hospitals, libraries, and labor-management relations. He was a ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and a member of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.

In the 1950s, Hill criticized US President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s attempts to reduce hospital funding that had been granted under the Hill-Burton Act. Hill strongly supported rural electrification and federally subsidized freight rates.

On September 4, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Nurse Training Act of 1964, naming Hill as one of the Members of Congress who pioneered the legislation.

===1962 campaign===
In 1962, Hill sought his last term in office but faced an unusually strong Republican opponent in James D. Martin, a petroleum products distributor from Gadsden. Like Hill, Martin supported the Tennessee Valley Authority, a New Deal project begun in 1933. Martin noted that the original sponsor of the interstate development agency was a Republican US Senator, George W. Norris of Nebraska. During the campaign, Martin proposed that the TVA headquarters be relocated from Knoxville, Tennessee, to its original point of development, Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Hill had worked to fund other public works projects too, including the deepening of the Mobile Ship Channel, the building of the Gainesville Lock and Dam in Sumter County, and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, an ultimately successful strategy to link the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico. In the campaign against Martin, Hill said, &quot;If Alabama is to continue the progress and development she has achieved, she cannot do so by deserting the great Democratic Party.&quot;
Hill pledged to seek renewed funding for the Redstone Arsenal and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and accused former President Eisenhower of having neglected the space program while the former Soviet Union was placing &quot;Sputnik&quot; into the atmosphere. Strongly endorsed by organized labor, Hill accused the Republicans of exploiting the South to enrich the North and the East and attacked the legacy of former President Herbert Hoover and the earlier &quot;evils&quot; of Reconstruction. Hill predicted that Alabama voters would bury the Republicans &quot;under an avalanche.&quot;

The 1962 midterm elections were overshadowed by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Martin joined Hill in endorsing the quarantine of Cuba but insisted that the problem was an outgrowth of the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Hill said that Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev had &quot;chickened out&quot; because &quot;the one thing the communists respect is strength.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that the blockade ordered by President John F. Kennedy may have saved Hill from defeat.

Despite the postwar bipartisan consensus for foreign aid, Martin hammered away at Hill&#x27;s backing for such programs. He decried subsidies to foreign manufacturers and workers at the expense of Alabama&#x27;s then large force of textile workers: &quot;These foreign giveaways have cost taxpayers billions of dollars and turned many areas of Alabama into distressed areas.&quot; Martin also condemned aid to communist countries and the impact of the United Nations on national policy. He questioned Hill&#x27;s congressional seniority as of little use when troops were dispatched in the fall of 1962 to compel the desegregation of the University of Mississippi.

The Hill-Martin race drew considerable national attention. The liberal columnist Drew Pearson wrote from Decatur, Alabama, that &quot;for the first time since Reconstruction, the two-party system, which political scientists talk about for the South, but never expect to materialize, may come to Alabama.&quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; viewed the Alabama race as the most vigorous off-year effort in modern Southern history but predicted a Hill victory on the basis that Martin had failed to gauge &quot;bread-and-butter&quot; issues and was perceived by many as an &quot;ultraconservative.&quot; 
Hill defeated Martin by 6,019 votes, 201,937 (50.9 percent) to 195,134 (49.1 percent). Turnout dropped sharply in 1962 compared to 1960, when presidential electors dominated the ballot, and the state split between the national Democratic ticket and unpledged electors who ultimately voted for U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr., of Virginia. Nearly 250,000 who had voted in the 1960 U.S. Senate election won by Democrat John Sparkman did not cast ballots in 1962. Hill won thirty-seven of the state&#x27;s sixty-seven counties. Martin&#x27;s strong showing enabled him to be elected in 1964 to the U.S. House, representing the 7th District.

==Later life==
In 1969, Hill was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. He received honorary degrees from thirteen colleges and universities, including the University of Alabama and Auburn University. He was a Methodist, a Freemason, a United States Army veteran of World War I—having been assigned to the Seventeenth and Seventy-first United States Infantry Regiments—and a member of the American Legion.

Hill retired from the Senate in 1969, and was succeeded by fellow Democrat James B. Allen of Gadsden, a former lieutenant governor and a leader of his state&#x27;s conservative faction. Hill died in Montgomery on December 20, 1984, and is interred there at Greenwood Cemetery. Hill is the namesake of the small community of Listerhill, Alabama.

His great-grandson, Joseph Lister Hubbard, is a former member of the Alabama House of Representatives from District 73 in Montgomery, holding office between 2010 and 2014. He was also the Democratic nominee for Attorney General of Alabama in the 2014 elections.

<text>Dixie Bibb Graves (July 26, 1882 – January 21, 1965) was a first lady of the State of Alabama and the first woman to serve as a United States senator from Alabama. She was appointed to the Senate by her husband, Governor Bibb Graves, when Senator Hugo Black resigned in order to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court in August 1937. Graves was succeeded by fellow Democrat Lister Hill, who would serve for over 3 decades.

==Biography==
Dixie Bibb was born on July 26, 1882, on the family plantation outside of Montgomery, Alabama. Her parents were Peyton and Isabel Thorpe Bibb. She attended the local public schools. In 1900, at the age of 18, she married state legislator David Bibb Graves.

==Civic activities==
Graves became a civic leader. She was a trustee of Alabama Boys&#x27; Industrial School in Birmingham and president of the United Daughters of the Confederacy from 1915 to 1917. She was active in the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, the Alabama Federation of Women’s Clubs, and the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

==Senate==
Her husband, Bibb Graves, became Alabama governor and began serving his second non-consecutive term in 1935. He appointed Dixie Bibb Graves to the U.S. Senate on August 20, 1937. The vacancy was caused by the resignation of Hugo L. Black, who became an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. Dixie Bibb Graves was the first woman senator from Alabama, and the first married woman to serve in the Senate (all the others had been widows). She served from August 20, 1937, until her resignation on January 10, 1938.

Governor Graves&#x27; justified his decision to appoint his wife as interim senator until a special election could be held so as not to favor any of the possible candidates in the special election. The governor would need their continued support for his programs.
During her brief tenure, Dixie Bibb Graves voted in support of New Deal programs directed at agriculture, crop control, and labor policy.

==Post-Senate activities==
Graves was active in many causes, including public welfare, health, and education. During World War II, she recruited for the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WACs), and worked for the American Red Cross and the United Service Organizations (USO). One WAC group was designated as the Dixie Bibb Graves Unit. A very active member of the State Advisors on Women&#x27;s Activities of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, an organization later known as the National March of Dimes Association, she worked for a cure and hospitals to treat polio. She was also chair or honorary chair of the Women&#x27;s Division of the State Democratic Campaign in 1948, 1952, 1956, and 1960. She was a member of the Alabama Historical Association, the American Legion Auxiliary, the No Name Club, and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.

==Death and legacy==
Graves died in Montgomery, Montgomery County, Alabama, on January 21, 1965 (age 82 years, 179 days). She is interred at Greenwood Cemetery, Montgomery, Alabama. She was named to the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1972.

The Dixie Bibb Graves Armory was built in Montgomery, Alabama in 1935 as a WPA project, which was converted in the 1990s to the Armory Learning Arts Center.

<text>Hans Moser (6 August 1880 – 19 June 1964) was an Austrian actor who, during his long career, from the 1920s up to his death, mainly played in comedy films. He was particularly associated with the genre of the &quot;Wiener Film&quot;. Moser appeared in over 150 films.

==Biography==
Born Johann Julier in Vienna, Moser very often portrayed the man in the street, typically someone else&#x27;s subordinate – servant, waiter, porter, shopkeeper, coachman, petty bureaucrat, etc. Also always he played honest, moral and well-intentioned people who, unable to keep cool and think clearly in crucial situations, get themselves and everyone around them into trouble. As the father of a beautiful daughter – often widowed – he was the stubborn one who realizes only at the end of the movie, when all cases of mistaken identity have been cleared up and all secrets are revealed, that he has been terribly wrong all the time.

Moser was particularly known for mumbling indistinctly for comic effect rather than pronouncing words and sentences clearly, and also for failing to finish his sentences – which, combined with his moderate Viennese dialect, made it hard for non-native speakers of Austrian German to understand what he was saying.

In Moser&#x27;s comedy films, Paul Hörbiger, Theo Lingen, Oskar Sima, and Annie Rosar were some of his congenial partners. However Moser was also a serious actor, especially on the stage and, towards the end of his life, on television. In many musical films, Moser can also be heard interpreting a &quot;Wienerlied&quot;, more likely than not at a Heuriger.
During the Nazi regime, Moser refused to divorce his Jewish wife Blanca Hirschler.

Hans Moser died in Vienna in 1964, aged 83. His continuing popularity is attested to by the fact that his style of speaking is still being parodied, often by very young entertainers.

<text>Armed and Dangerous is a 1986 American comedy film directed by Mark L. Lester and starring John Candy, Eugene Levy, Robert Loggia and Meg Ryan. It was filmed on location in and around Los Angeles, California.

==Plot==
Los Angeles police officer Frank Dooley is framed for stealing a television set by corrupt detectives Rizzo and Nedler and dismissed from the force. Meanwhile, hapless defense attorney Norman Kane is threatened with death by his latest client should he fail to keep him out of prison. Kane reveals his ineptitude and the death threat to the judge, who agrees to render a long sentence if Kane resigns as a lawyer.

Dooley and Kane meet when they apply for work at Guard Dog Security, run by Captain Clarence O&#x27;Connell and part of a union represented by Klepper and Lazarus. Becoming licensed security guards after a single afternoon of training, Dooley and Kane are made partners by supervisor Maggie Cavanaugh and assigned to night duty at a pharmaceutical warehouse. Ordered to take a lunch break by senior guard Bruno, Kane happens upon an armed robbery of the warehouse and calls Frank for help, but they prove no match for the thieves.

The next day, the pair are berated by O&#x27;Connell for their failure. While they are venting their anger toward O&#x27;Connell, Maggie reveals that she is his daughter. Dooley and Kane then attend a meeting of the union, where Kane&#x27;s attempt to file a grievance against Guard Dog is quashed by union president Michael Carlino. Kane pointedly questions Carlino about how the union dues, adding to about $4 million per year, are spent. After Kane rejects an evasive answer from treasurer Lou Brackman, Carlino threatens Kane should he ever attend another union meeting.

Over the next few days, Dooley and Kane find themselves assigned to work at a landfill and a toxic waste dump. Convinced something illegal is afoot after hearing a story from two fellow security guards about a similar robbery, the pair track down Bruno at his gym and interrogate him. Bruno admits that O&#x27;Connell had him order them to lunch the night of the robbery. They visit an informant friend of Dooley&#x27;s for information on Carlino and bring their suspicions to Maggie, but she rejects them for having no evidence.

Dooley and Kane next attend a party thrown by Carlino, hoping to gather some evidence. Eavesdropping on a meeting between Carlino and Brackman, they learn that Carlino is using the pension fund to finance dealings with a drug cartel and plans to have the money robbed from an armored car, with insurance covering the loss. Fearing the insurance company will investigate, Brackman urges Carlino not to execute the robbery. Carlino instructs Klepper and Lazarus to kill Brackman. Dooley and Kane attempt to save Brackman, but are too late to prevent his murder. After a night spent evading the police, the two make plans with Maggie to prevent the armored car robbery. Kane and Maggie take over driving the truck, while Dooley plans to meet them ahead of the would-be robbers.

Dooley has problems with his motorcycle while weaving through a traffic jam on L.A.&#x27;s Sixth Street Viaduct and is forced to hitch a ride with a trucker who bulldozes his way through plenty of the city&#x27;s traffic itself, destroying several cars in the process. Meanwhile, Kane and Maggie avoid assaults from multiple cars attempting to hold them up. Dooley is able to arrive in time to save the armored car from a final all out attack from Klepper and Lazarus. O&#x27;Connell arrives, having captured Carlino and his associates, Rizzo and Nedler.

The criminals are arrested and Dooley is invited back to the police force, along with a reluctant Kane.

==Production==
The project was initially developed by Harold Ramis as a vehicle for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. According to John Candy, John Carpenter was initially attached to direct. Carpenter stated that he dropped out of the project after Aykroyd stipulated that he would not star in the film unless the script was changed to culminate with a car chase.

Ramis said the film &quot;had died a quiet death, and then was resurrected by Brian Grazer, the producer. And Brian said, &#x27;If I can find a director, can I make the movie?&#x27; And I said okay.&quot; Candy and Tom Hanks were cast, but Hanks dropped out, and Candy recommended Eugene Levy, his costar in &quot;Second City Television&quot; and &quot;Going Berserk&quot; (1983), to replace Hanks. Ramis said the film &quot;was not good. I tried to take my name off it. I took my name off in one place&quot;, referring to his executive producer credit, which was removed prior to release. Ramis is still credited as a screenwriter, despite his objections.

==Release and reception==
The film opened in the United States on August 15, 1986 to poor reviews and low sales at the box office. &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; holds a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews.

Reflecting on the movie in 2014, director Mark Lester said, &quot;The movie came out okay, but I wasn&#x27;t used to working with comedians. I was trying to tell the story and put in some good action scenes, but they didn&#x27;t care about any of that. They just wanted to be funny.&quot;

<text>Albina Guarnieri (born June 23, 1953) is a former Canadian politician. She was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 2011 who represented the Greater Toronto Area ridings of Mississauga East and Mississauga East—Cooksville. She served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Paul Martin as Minister of Veterans Affairs.

==Background==
Guarnieri was educated at McGill University, where she graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in English. As part of her thesis, she wrote a book called &quot;The cheese on the moon: a collection of short stories&quot;. After graduating she worked for the federal government as a spokesperson for Bob Kaplan and also as a press liaison office for Stuart Smith, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. In 1981, she worked as an assistant to Toronto Mayor Art Eggleton but left after seven months &quot;because of a disagreement&quot;. In 1984, she worked for &quot;Lowther Consulting&quot;, a company owned by Jim Coutts who was a principal secretary for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. She and her husband live in Mississauga.

==Politics==
In 1988 Guarnieri was nominated in the new riding of Mississauga East after a fractious contest with another candidate, Armindo Silva. Silva contended that the vote, which Guarnieri won by a margin of 71, was marred by &#x27;irregularities and improprieties&#x27;. He vowed to contest the result with the party&#x27;s nomination board. The party hired police officers to control the crowd due to threats made against Guarnieri. The nomination board upheld the vote despite &quot;deeply disturbing&quot; voting irregularities but this decision was overturned by the Ontario party&#x27;s executive board. A second, less contentious vote was held which Guarnieri won by a much wider margin.

Guarnieri was elected as Member of Parliament in 1988 in a fairly close race with her Progressive Conservative opponent Laurie Pallett. She won all her subsequent elections in Mississauga East and after 2004 in [Mississauga East—Cooksville by wide margins. A longtime Martin loyalist, she was a relatively obscure backbencher during the Chrétien era. Martin named her Associate Minister of National Defence and Minister of State for Civil Preparedness in his first cabinet. She moved to Veterans Affairs on July 20, 2004.

She also served as Chair of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, Chair of the Standing Committee on Government Operations, and Co-Chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages. She also served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

In September 2010, Guarnieri announced that she would not seek re-election due to being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

<text>A Strike/Flight Numeral is a Department of the Navy device that may be awarded for wear on the Air Medal to individuals serving in any capacity in the United States Armed Forces. A Strike/Flight Award is awarded to individuals for meritorious achievement while participating in sustained aerial flight operations, under flight orders. Strike/Flight Numerals are bronze Arabic numerals 5/16 inch in height and are worn to denote the total number of Strike/Flight awards

Only personnel under flight orders are eligible to receive the strike/flight award of an Air Medal. Officers in the rank of Captain (Colonel in the Marine Corps) or above are not eligible for award of the Air Medal on a strike/flight basis unless the sorties they fly are required in the performance of their regular duties.

* Strikes are sorties that deliver ordnance against the enemy, insert or extract assault personnel, or engage in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations that encounter enemy opposition.
* Flights are sorties that deliver ordnance against the enemy, insert or extract assault personnel, or engage in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations that encounter no enemy opposition. The distinguishing feature of a flight is that although it takes place in a nominally hostile environment, it does not encounter enemy opposition.

As of September 27, 2006, gold 5/16 inch Arabic numerals are used to denote the number of &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medals. This is a return to the standard used before November 22, 1989. In the interval between November 22, 1989, and September 27, 2006, bronze, gold, and silver 5/16 inch stars denoted the number of &quot;Individual&quot; Air Medals awarded. A bronze star was used to denote a first award and gold stars were used for the second through the fifth awards, seventh through tenth awards, and so on. Silver stars were used in lieu of five gold stars, and denote the sixth and eleventh (and so on) awards.

<text>Ivan Basso (born 26 November 1977) is an Italian former professional road bicycle racer, who rode professionally between 1999 and 2015 for seven different teams. Basso, nicknamed Ivan the Terrible, was considered among the best mountain riders in the professional field in the early 21st century, and was considered one of the strongest stage race riders. He is a double winner of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, having won the race in 2006 for and 2010 for .

In 2007, Basso admitted to planning the use of blood doping and was suspended for two years. His suspension ended on 24 October 2008, and he returned to racing two days later in the Japan Cup, where he placed a close third behind Damiano Cunego and Giovanni Visconti. He later returned to racing in his home tour, and in 2010, he won his second Giro d&#x27;Italia, winning two stages along the way.

==Biography==
He was born in Gallarate, located in the province of Varese in Lombardy. He grew up next door to Claudio Chiappucci, a former three-time stage winner in the Tour de France who was suspended for two years after being proven guilty of doping several times.

As an amateur, he finished second in the road race at the 1995 UCI Juniors Road World Championships and his first big result was winning the under-23 road race at the 1998 UCI Road World Championships. In his youth he fiercely competed with fellow Italian riders Giuliano Figueras and especially Danilo Di Luca who proclaimed he would have won the under-23 World Championship himself had it not been for the team tactics. Before Basso could turn professional, his parents wanted to see him finish his Technical Geometry studies. He turned professional with Davide Boifava&#x27;s Riso Scotti–Vinavil team in 1999, where he rode his first Giro d&#x27;Italia. He did not finish the three-week race, but he made it a priority to win it some day. In 2000, with the team now called , he won his first professional victories in the Regio-Tour.

===Promising results===
In 2001, he moved to under the guidance of sporting director Giancarlo Ferretti. He scored several notable victories in 2001, and he made his Tour de France debut in the 2001 edition. His attack on the Bastille Day stage prompted a five-man break-away which rode for the victory, but Basso crashed on a mountain descent and was forced to abandon the race.

His next two years were devoid of significant wins, even though he had promising rides in the Tour de France. In the 2002 Tour de France, Basso finished 11th overall and won the young rider classification, the award presented to the best-placed rider in the general classification under the age of 25.
He impressed again in the 2003 Tour de France, finishing seventh overall in spite of receiving little help from his Fassa Bortolo teammates who, after dedicating their efforts in the first part of the race to help Alessandro Petacchi win four stages, had to pull out due to food poisoning, leaving only two riders to help Basso. Despite his good results as the best placed Italian rider in the Tour de France, he was behind fellow Italian teammate Dario Frigo in the Fassa Bortolo pecking order for the biggest race in Italy, the Giro. After the promising start to his Fassa Bortolo career, Basso&#x27;s relationship with Ferretti turned sour. Basso failed to respond well to the management methods of the &quot;iron sergeant&quot; who thought Basso did not win enough races.

Apart from the individual time trial stages, Basso had only lost around a single minute to winner Lance Armstrong in the 2003 Tour, and he was not short of new team offers. Despite strong rumors sending him to the team, Basso moved to for the 2004 season, under guidance of team manager Bjarne Riis. At , Basso was to fill the role as team captain, which Tyler Hamilton had left vacant at the Danish outfit, with the main aim to be a challenger in the Tour de France. Basso&#x27;s weakness was the time trial and before the 2004 season he and teammate Carlos Sastre trained in a wind tunnel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to improve their aerodynamics and positioning on the bike. The time trial skill of Basso was one of the main points of improvements over the next years.

===Heir apparent===

Basso looked impressive in the 2004 Tour de France, winning stage 12 ahead of eventual winner Lance Armstrong, his first victory since 2001. His overall time was hurt by relatively poor time trial results: he only finished 8th on the stage 16 time trial up the mountain Alpe d&#x27;Huez, where he was caught and passed by Armstrong, and 6th in the stage 19 time trial. In all, he lost a combined 5 minutes and 13 seconds in the two stages. His time loss on the last time trial effectively sent Basso down to third place behind Andreas Klöden, and Basso finished 6:40 behind overall winner Armstrong. He ended the season, participating with the Italian national team in the 2004 UCI Road World Championships in Verona, helping fellow Italian Luca Paolini get a bronze medal. In the off-season, Team CSC was in a financial struggle. Even as Bjarne Riis let riders who received superior offers from other teams leave, Basso did not move to the team even though an economically more lucrative contract was proposed.

January 2005 saw the death of Basso&#x27;s mother, who died after battling cancer. Basso went on to focus on the 2005 Giro d&#x27;Italia, in her memory, as his main aim for that season. By both focusing on winning the Giro and the Tour, he was going against the trend of only aiming for one big race a season, a tactic most notably employed successfully by Lance Armstrong. Basso wore the pink jersey as leader of the General classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia until severe stomach problems caused him to lose the lead on stage 13 on the Passo delle Erbe. He lost another 40 minutes during the 14th stage, a mountain stage which included the Stelvio Pass, and thus effectively ended his bid for overall honors. No longer dangerous to the other main riders, Basso decided to continue in the race with the objective of winning individual stages. He did manage to achieve this goal at stage 17, a mountain stage. He also won the 18th stage, a time trial, ahead of teammate David Zabriskie, demonstrating the improvement he had made in this area.
At the 2005 Tour de France, he started out comparatively weakly on stage 10, the first mountain stage of the race, where he trailed the front group by a minute. But for the rest of the race, Basso was once again the only rider to keep up with the race leader Lance Armstrong in the mountains, and on occasion he tried to pressure the eventual winner by going on the attack. Basso was still weaker in the time trials, although he had improved significantly when compared to 2004. He lost a collective 3:47 over two time trial stages, as Basso placed second overall in the Tour, 4:40 behind Lance Armstrong. During the 2005 Tour de France, Basso signed a new three-year contract with Team CSC.

===2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia===
Following his overall rank of 28th in the 2005 Giro d&#x27;Italia, Basso returned to the Giro in 2006 with the intention to win. Following a good performance in the stage 1 time trial, Basso and his CSC teammates won the 5th stage, a team time trial. Basso&#x27;s first solo stage victory came on the 8th stage, the first mountaintop finish of the Giro, where he countered an attack by Damiano Cunego and rode to the finish by himself. That victory also allowed him to gain enough time on his rivals to put him in the leader&#x27;s pink jersey for the first time in the race, a jersey which he would hold on to for the remaining 13 stages.

Stage 11 was a long and flat individual time trial where Basso finished in second place, losing only to former two-time world time trial champion Jan Ullrich, beating riders like the Italian national time trial champion Marco Pinotti. During the last week of the 2006 Giro, Basso beat his main rivals for the general classification, and won stages 16 and 20 along the way. His victory in Stage 20, where he rode to a solo victory on the final ascent into Aprica after riding away from rival Gilberto Simoni, was notable when he, already sure of his victory, pulled out a picture of his newly born son Santiago, and held it aloft as he crossed the finish line. Santiago Basso had been born the previous day, and Basso had not yet seen his son in the flesh, having been given the picture only hours before the stage started. When rival Simoni rolled across the line over a minute behind Basso, he was clearly upset at being beaten and made a remark that Basso&#x27;s dominance at that year&#x27;s Giro was &quot;extra-terrestrial.&quot; Basso eventually finished 9 minutes 18 seconds up on the second placed rider, José Enrique Gutiérrez, the largest margin of victory in the Giro d&#x27;Italia since 1965. After the last stage of the race, Basso declared that he would continue along his pre-season plan to also ride the Tour de France.

===Operación Puerto and the 2006 Tour de France===

On 30 June 2006, the management of the Tour de France announced at a press conference that a number of riders, including Ivan Basso, would not be riding in the race due to rumours of blood doping stemming from the Operación Puerto doping case in Spain. According to the investigation, Basso was allegedly given blood doping by doctor Eufemiano Fuentes in a Spanish clinic. No formal charges had been raised, but following an agreement between the managers of all the ProTour teams, any rider under suspicion of doping would not be allowed to start in ProTour races. This forced CSC to remove Basso from their squad for the 2006 Tour.

Speculation in the Italian press suggested that should Basso not be banned he would be joining the Discovery Channel team. Team CSC described these suggestions as just rumours. Later, CSC manager Bjarne Riis was reported stating that it was unlikely that Basso could return to CSC without proving he had no contact with Fuentes, as Basso&#x27;s contract specified that he could receive no outside medical assistance. Riis conceded that it might be impossible for Basso to prove beyond doubt. Rumours also talked about Basso moving to or (a non-ProTour team). The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) proceedings commenced in late August 2006.

====From CSC to Team Discovery Channel====

On 18 October 2006, Team CSC announced that his contract had been terminated by mutual consent. On 27 October 2006, Basso was acquitted of any involvement in the Operation Puerto events by the committee, due to insufficient evidence.

On 9 November 2006 Basso announced he was joining Lance Armstrong&#x27;s former team, . The announcement was made in Austin, Texas, and Basso joined the team on 3 December 2006 for the first unofficial training camp. Basso rode for Levi Leipheimer during the 2007 Tour of California,
and also raced Tirreno–Adriatico, where he crashed.

====Puerto case reopened====
On 24 April 2007, Basso was suspended by Discovery Channel when the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) reopened his case. On 30 April 2007 Team Discovery Channel announced that Basso would be released from his contract. Basso requested to leave the team citing &quot;personal reasons related to the re-opened investigation by the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI).&quot; Basso met with the General Manager of Team Discovery Channel, Bill Stapleton, and Johan Bruyneel, the Team Director, and the two agreed to allow Basso to leave the team. While still claiming to never have actually engaged in blood doping, Basso admitted contacting Fuentes&#x27; clinic with the intention to engage in blood doping.

Basso appeared before the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) on 2 May 2007. On 7 May 2007, Basso admitted his involvement with the drug scandal to the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI). In a later press conference he stated it was &quot;attempted doping&quot;, and that while he had not actually undergone doping, he was &quot;fully aware that an attempt at doping is tantamount to doping&quot; and that &quot;[he would] serve [his] suspension and then return to race.&quot;

On 15 June 2007, Basso received a two-year ban. The time he had already spent under team suspension whilst riding for CSC and temporary suspension since leaving Discovery were taken into consideration which means he was banned until 25 October 2008.

===Return after suspension===

After his return Basso signed a two-year contract with , his first race being in the Japan Cup on 26 October 2008. He proceeded to finish third, behind Damiano Cunego and Giovanni Visconti. In April 2009 he claimed overall victory in the Italian stage race Giro del Trentino. He then competed in his main objective for the year, the Giro d&#x27;Italia, where he finished fifth behind eventual winner Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, fellow rider Franco Pellizotti and 2008 Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre. He also placed 4th in the Vuelta a España behind Alejandro Valverde, Samuel Sánchez, and Cadel Evans respectively.
====2010====
In 2010, Basso aimed to win his second Giro d&#x27;Italia, leading with his teammate Vincenzo Nibali. Despite having a quiet start to the race, he won the 15th stage of the race atop Monte Zoncolan, after his Liquigas team had set the pace for some in order to chase down a breakaway. After Stage 19, he led the general classification as a result of out-climbing previous race leader David Arroyo, and held it to the end of the race. This resulted in his second Giro win, after 2006. Basso then focused on the Tour de France where he attempted to win the Giro and the Tour during the same year but he ended up struggling through the last week, finishing 32nd.
====2011====
In 2011, Basso skipped the Giro d&#x27;Italia to focus on the Tour de France. After having a good start over the first 2 weeks sitting 5th overall, Basso struggled on stages 16 and 17 after being dropped on the final descents, and later finished 7th overall. 
====2012====
In 2012, Basso started the season with quiet form focusing on the Giro d&#x27;Italia, but only finishing 5th overall.
===Tinkoff-Saxo===
In August 2014, it was announced that Basso would be joining from 2015 on a two-year deal. In July 2015, Basso was diagnosed with testicular cancer and immediately withdrew from the Tour de France to seek treatment in Italy. Basso received support from a number of people including Lance Armstrong. Basso made the announcement to the media in those terms: &quot;I have a bad announcement to give to you guys&quot;, Basso said. &quot;On stage 5, I had a really small crash but in the crash I touched my testicle on the saddle and for a few days, I felt a small pain. Yesterday we spoke with the doctor of the Tour de France and we decided to go to make a special analysis in the hospital and the examination gave me bad news. I have a small cancer in the left testicle.&quot;

In September 2015 confirmed that Basso had recovered fully after undergoing surgery in Milan and that he would be able to race again. However, after Basso had talks with the team it was announced that he would retire from competition the following month, whilst remaining with in a management role. Basso later followed Alberto Contador to , taking up a support staff position.

== Post racing ==
Following his exit from racing, Basso and Alberto Contador opened up Aurum bikes in 2020.

==Personal life==
Basso resides in Cassano Magnago, Italy, with his wife and four children.

He has now purchased land in his home town to start a blueberry farm where he hopes to employ locals as well as make an investment for his retirement from cycling as the future of the European economy is uncertain. Basso has already begun planting; his farm is called &quot;Il Borgo&quot; or &quot;the village&quot;.

He is not related to Italian cyclist Marino Basso, nor the brand Basso.

<doc id="846329" wikidata="Q743203" url="?curid=846329" title="Late Spring">
<text>is a 1949 Japanese drama film directed by Yasujirō Ozu and written by Ozu and Kogo Noda, based on the short novel &quot;Father and Daughter&quot; (&quot;Chichi to musume&quot;) by the 20th-century novelist and critic Kazuo Hirotsu. The film was written and shot during the Allied Powers&#x27; Occupation of Japan and was subject to the Occupation&#x27;s official censorship requirements. Starring Chishū Ryū, who was featured in almost all of the director&#x27;s films, and Setsuko Hara, marking her first of six appearances in Ozu&#x27;s work, it is the first installment of Ozu’s so-called &quot;Noriko trilogy&quot;, succeeded by &quot;Early Summer&quot; (&quot;Bakushu&quot;, 1951) and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; (&quot;Tokyo Monogatari&quot;, 1953); in each of which Hara portrays a young woman named Noriko, though the three Norikos are distinct, unrelated characters, linked primarily by their status as single women in postwar Japan.

&quot;Late Spring&quot; belongs to the type of Japanese cinema known as &quot;shomin-geki&quot;, a genre that deals with the ordinary daily lives of working class and middle class people of modern times. The film is frequently regarded as the first in the director&#x27;s final creative period, &quot;the major prototype of the [director&#x27;s] 1950s and 1960s work&quot;. These films are characterized by, among other traits, an exclusive focus on stories about families during Japan&#x27;s immediate postwar era, a tendency towards very simple plots and the use of a generally static camera.

&quot;Late Spring&quot; was released on September 19, 1949, to critical acclaim in the Japanese press. In the following year, it was awarded the prestigious &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; critics&#x27; award as the best Japanese production released in 1949. In 1972, the film was commercially released in the United States, again to very positive reviews. &quot;Late Spring&quot; has been referred to as the director&#x27;s &quot;most perfect&quot; work, as &quot;the definitive film of Ozu&#x27;s master filmmaking approach and language&quot; and has been called &quot;one of the most perfect, most complete, and most successful studies of character ever achieved in Japanese cinema&quot;. In the 2012 version of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s decennial poll of &quot;The Greatest Films of All Time&quot;, published by the British Film Institute (BFI), &quot;Late Spring&quot; appears as the second highest-ranking Japanese-language film on the list at number 15, behind Ozu&#x27;s own &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; at number 3.

==Plot==
The film opens at a tea ceremony. Professor Shukichi Somiya (Chishu Ryu), a widower, has only one child, a twenty-seven-year-old unmarried daughter, Noriko (Setsuko Hara), who takes care of the household and the everyday needs—cooking, cleaning, mending, etc.—of her father. On a shopping trip to Tokyo, Noriko encounters one of her father&#x27;s friends, Professor Jo Onodera (Masao Mishima), who lives in Kyoto. Noriko knows that Onodera, who had been a widower like her father, has recently remarried, and she tells him that she finds the very idea of his remarriage distasteful, even &quot;filthy.&quot; Onodera, and later her father, tease her for having such thoughts.
Shukichi&#x27;s sister, Aunt Masa (Haruko Sugimura), convinces him that it is high time his daughter got married. Noriko is friendly with her father’s assistant, Hattori (Jun Usami), and Aunt Masa suggests that her brother ask Noriko if she might be interested in Hattori. When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time.

Undaunted, Masa pressures Noriko to meet with a marriageable young man, a Tokyo University graduate named Satake who, Masa believes, bears a strong resemblance to Gary Cooper. Noriko declines, explaining that she does not wish to marry anyone, because to do so would leave her father alone and helpless. Masa surprises Noriko by claiming that she is also trying to arrange a match between Shukichi and Mrs. Miwa (Kuniko Miyake), an attractive young widow known to Noriko. If Masa succeeds, Noriko would have no excuse.

At a Noh performance attended by Noriko and her father, the latter smilingly greets Mrs. Miwa, which triggers Noriko&#x27;s jealousy. When her father later tries to talk her into going to meet Satake, he tells her that he intends to marry Mrs. Miwa. Devastated, Noriko reluctantly decides to meet the young man and, to her surprise, has a very favorable impression of him. Under pressure from all sides, Noriko consents to the arranged marriage.

The Somiyas go on one last trip together before the wedding, visiting Kyoto. There they meet Professor Onodera and his family. Noriko changes her opinion of Onodera&#x27;s remarriage when she discovers that his new wife is a nice person. While packing their luggage for the trip home, Noriko asks her father why they cannot simply stay as they are now, even if he does remarry – she cannot imagine herself any happier than living with and taking care of him. Shukichi admonishes her, saying that she must embrace the new life she will build with Satake, one in which he, Shukichi, will have no part, because &quot;that’s the order of human life and history.&quot; Noriko asks her father’s forgiveness for her &quot;selfishness&quot; and agrees to go ahead with the marriage.

Noriko’s wedding day arrives. At home just before the ceremony, both Shukichi and Masa admire Noriko, who is dressed in a traditional wedding costume. Noriko thanks her father for the care he has taken of her throughout her life and leaves in a hired car for the wedding. Afterwards, Aya (Yumeji Tsukioka), a divorced friend of Noriko’s, goes with Shukichi to a bar, where he confesses that his claim that he was going to marry Mrs. Miwa was a ruse to persuade Noriko to get married herself. Aya, touched by his sacrifice, promises to visit him often. Shukichi returns home alone.

===The Occupation censorship===

====Censorship problems with &quot;Late Spring&quot;====
The central event of &quot;Late Spring&quot; is the marriage of the heroine to a man she has met only once through a single arranged meeting. This immediately presented a problem for the censors of the American Occupation. According to film scholar Kyoko Hirano, these officials &quot;considered feudalistic the Japanese custom of arranged meetings for prospective marriage partners, &quot;miai&quot;, because the custom seemed to them to downgrade the importance of the individual.&quot; Hirano notes that, had this policy against showing arranged marriages onscreen been rigidly enforced, &quot;Late Spring&quot; could never have been made. In the original synopsis (which the filmmakers were required to submit to the censorship before production could be approved), Noriko’s decision to marry was presented as a collective family decision, not an individual choice, and the censors apparently rejected this.

The synopsis explained that the trip to Kyoto by father and daughter, just prior to Noriko’s marriage, occurs so she can visit her dead mother’s grave. This motivation is absent from the finished film, possibly because the censors would have interpreted such a visit as “ancestor worship,” a practice they frowned upon.

Any reference in the script to the devastation caused by the American bombings was removed. In the script, Shukichi remarks to Onodera’s wife in Kyoto that her city is a very nice place, unlike Tokyo, with all its ruins. The censors deleted the reference to ruins (as an implied critique of the Allies) and, in the finished film, the word “hokorippoi” (“dusty”) was substituted as a description of Tokyo.

The censors at first automatically deleted a reference in the script to the Hollywood star Gary Cooper, but then reinstated it when they realized that the comparison was to Noriko’s (unseen) suitor Satake, who is described by the female characters as attractive, and was thus flattering to the American actor.

Sometimes, the censors’ demands seemed irrational. A line about Noriko’s health having been negatively affected by &quot;her work after being conscripted by the [Japanese] Navy during the war&quot; was changed to &quot;the forced work during the war,&quot; as if even the very mention of the Japanese Navy was somehow suspect.

At the script phase of the censorship process, the censors demanded that the character of Aunt Masa, who at one point finds a lost change purse on the ground and keeps it as a kind of good-luck charm, should be shown handing over the purse to the police. Ozu responded by turning the situation, in the finished film, into a kind of running gag in which Shukichi repeatedly (and futilely) urges his sister to turn the purse in to the police. This change has been called &quot;a mocking kind of partial compliance with the censorship.&quot;

====Ozu&#x27;s alleged &quot;subversion&quot; of censorship====
One scholar, Lars-Martin Sorensen, has claimed that Ozu&#x27;s partial aim in making the film was to present an ideal of Japan at odds with that which the Occupation wanted to promote, and that he successfully subverted the censorship in order to accomplish this. &quot;The controversial and subversive politico-historical &#x27;message&#x27; of the film is… that the beauty of tradition, and of subjugation of individual whims to tradition and history, by far outshines the imported and imposed western trends of occupied Japan.&quot;
Sorensen uses as an example the scene early in the film in which Noriko and her father&#x27;s assistant Hattori are bicycling towards the beach. They pass a diamond-shaped Coca-Cola sign and another sign, in English, warning that the weight capacity of a bridge over which they are riding is 30 tons: quite irrelevant information for this young couple, but perfectly appropriate for American military vehicles that might pass along that road. (Neither the Coke sign nor the road warning are referred to in the script approved by the censors.) Sorensen argues that these objects are &quot;obvious reference(s) to the presence of the occupying army.&quot;

On the other hand, &quot;Late Spring&quot;, more than any other film Ozu made, is suffused with the symbols of Japanese tradition: the tea ceremony that opens the film, the temples at Kamakura, the Noh performance that Noriko and Shukichi witness, and the landscape and Zen gardens of Kyoto. Sorensen argues that these images of historical landmarks &quot;were intended to inspire awe and respect for the treasures of ancient Japan in contrast to the impurity of the present.&quot; Sorensen also claims that, to Ozu’s audience, &quot;the exaltation of Japanese tradition and cultural and religious heritage must have brought remembrances of the good old days when Japan was still winning her battles abroad and nationalism reached its peak.&quot; To scholars such as Bordwell who assert that Ozu was promoting with this film an ideology that could be called liberal, Sorensen argues that contemporary reviews of the film &quot;show that Ozu (the director and his personal convictions) was considered inseparable from his films, and that he was considered a conservative purist.&quot;

Sorensen concludes that such censorship may not necessarily be a bad thing. &quot;One of the positive side effects of being prohibited from airing one&#x27;s views openly and directly is that it forces artists to be creative and subtle in their ways of expression.&quot;

===Ozu&#x27;s collaborators===
On &quot;Late Spring&quot;, Ozu worked with a number of old colleagues from his prewar days, such as actor Chishu Ryu and cinematographer Yuharu Atsuta. However, a long-deferred reunion with one artist and the beginning of a long collaboration with another—the screenwriter Kogo Noda and the actress Setsuko Hara, respectively—were to prove critical artistically, both to this work and to the direction of Ozu&#x27;s subsequent career.

====Kogo Noda====
Kogo Noda, already an accomplished screenwriter, had collaborated with Ozu on the script of his debut film of 1927, &quot;Sword of Penitence&quot;. Noda had later written scripts with Ozu (while also collaborating with other directors) on many of his best silent pictures, including &quot;Tokyo Chorus&quot;. Yet by 1949, the director had not worked with his old friend for fourteen years. However, their reunion on &quot;Late Spring&quot; was so harmonious and successful that Ozu wrote exclusively with Noda for the rest of his career.

Ozu once said of Noda: &quot;When a director works with a scriptwriter they must have some characteristics and habits in common; otherwise, they won&#x27;t get along. My daily life—what time I get up, how much sake I drink and so on—is in almost complete agreement with that of [Noda]. When I work with Noda, we collaborate even on short bits of dialogue. Although we never discuss the details of the sets or costumes, his mental image of these things is always in accord with mine; our ideas never criss cross or go awry. We even agree on whether a dialogue should end with &quot;wa&quot; or &quot;yo&quot;.&quot; From &quot;Late Spring&quot; on, partly due to Noda&#x27;s influence, all Ozu’s characters would be comfortably middle class and thus, unlike the characters in, for example, &quot;Record of a Tenement Gentleman&quot; or &quot;A Hen in the Wind&quot;, beyond immediate physical want and necessity.

====Setsuko Hara====
Setsuko Hara (born Masae Aida in Yokohama, Kanagawa prefecture on June 17, 1920) had appeared in films since the mid-1930s, when she was in her teens. Her tall frame and strong facial features—including very large eyes and a prominent nose—were unusual among Japanese actresses at the time; it has been rumored, but not verified, that she has a German grandparent. She maintained her popularity throughout the war years, when she appeared in many films made for propaganda purposes by the military government, becoming &quot;the perfect war-movie heroine.&quot; After the defeat of Japan, she was more popular than ever, so that by the time Ozu worked with her for the first time on &quot;Late Spring&quot;, she had already become &quot;one of Japan&#x27;s best-loved actresses.&quot;

Ozu had a very high regard for Hara&#x27;s work. He said: &quot;Every Japanese actor can play the role of a soldier and every Japanese actress can play the role of a prostitute to some extent. However, it is rare to find an actress [like Hara] who can play the role of a daughter from a good family.&quot; Speaking of her performance in &quot;Early Summer&quot;, he was quoted as saying: &quot;Setsuko Hara is a really good actress. I wish I had four or five more like her.&quot;

In addition to the three &quot;Noriko&quot; films, Ozu directed her in three other roles: as an unhappily married wife in &quot;Tokyo Twilight&quot; (&quot;Tokyo Boshoku&quot;, 1957), as the mother of a marriageable daughter in &quot;Late Autumn&quot; (&quot;Akibiyori&quot;, 1960) and the daughter-in-law of a sake plant owner in the director&#x27;s penultimate film, &quot;The End of Summer&quot; (&quot;Kohayagawa-ke no Aki&quot;, 1961). Bordwell summed up the critical consensus of Hara&#x27;s significance to the late work of Ozu when he wrote: &quot;After 1948, Setsuko Hara becomes the archetypal Ozu woman, either the bride-to-be or the widow of middle years.&quot;

==Narrative, themes and characterization==

===Narrative strategies===
The films of Yasujirō Ozu are well known for their unusual approach to film narrative. Scenes that most filmmakers would consider obligatory (e.g., the wedding of Noriko) are often not shown at all, while apparently extraneous incidents (e.g., the concert attended by Hattori but &quot;not&quot; Noriko) are given seemingly inordinate prominence. Sometimes important narrative information is withheld not only from a major character, but from the viewer, such as the news of Hattori’s engagement, about which neither Noriko’s father nor the audience has any knowledge until Noriko, laughing, informs him. And at times, the filmmaker proceeds, within a scene, to jump from one time frame to another without transition, as when two establishing shots of some travelers waiting for a train on a platform lead to a third shot of the same train already on its way to Tokyo.

====&quot;Parametric&quot; narrative theory====
Bordwell refers to Ozu’s approach to narrative as &quot;parametric narration.&quot; By this term, Bordwell means that Ozu’s &quot;overunified&quot; visual approach, characterized by its “stylistic rigor,” often provides the basis for &quot;playful deviation,&quot; including narrative playfulness. As Bordwell puts it somewhat more plainly, Ozu &quot;back[s] away from his own machinery in order to achieve humor and surprise.&quot; In his view, &quot;in narrative poetry, rhythm and rhyme need not completely subordinate themselves to the demand of telling the story; in art song or opera, &#x27;autonomous&#x27; musical structures may require that the story grind to a halt while particular harmonic or melodic patterns work themselves out. Similarly, in some films, temporal or spatial qualities can lure us with a patterning that is not wholly dependent on representing fabula [i.e., story] information.&quot;

Bordwell points out that the opening scene of &quot;Late Spring&quot; &quot;begins at the railroad station, where the characters &quot;aren’t&quot;. A later scene will do exactly the same thing, showing the train station before showing [the characters] already hurtling towards Tokyo… In Tokyo, [Professor] Onodera and Noriko discuss going to an art exhibit; cut to a sign for the exhibit, then to the steps of the art gallery; cut to the two in a bar, after they’ve gone to the exhibit.&quot;

====&quot;Essentialist&quot; narrative theory====
To Kathe Geist, Ozu’s narrative methods reflect the artist&#x27;s economy of means, not &quot;playfulness.&quot; &quot;His frequent use of repetition and [narrative] ellipsis do not &#x27;impose their will&#x27; on Ozu’s plots; they &quot;are&quot; his plots. By paying attention to what has been left out and to what is repeated, one arrives at Ozu’s essential story.&quot;

As an example, Geist cites the scene in which Noriko and Hattori bicycle together to the beach and have a conversation there, an incident that appears to imply a budding romantic relationship between them. When Noriko slightly later reveals to her father that Hattori, before that bicycle trip, had already been engaged to another woman, &quot;we wonder&quot;, writes Geist, &quot;why Ozu has wasted so much time on the &#x27;wrong man&#x27; [for Noriko].&quot; However, the key to the beach scene’s importance to the plot, according to Geist, is the dialogue between Hattori and Noriko, in which the latter tells him that she is &quot;the jealous type.&quot; This seemingly unlikely claim, given her affable nature, is later confirmed when she becomes bitterly jealous at her father’s apparent plan to remarry. &quot;Her jealousy goads her into her own marriage and is thus the pivot on which the plot turns.&quot;

Geist sums up her analysis of several major Ozu films of the postwar period by asserting that &quot;the narratives unfold with an astounding precision in which no shot and certainly no scene is wasted and all is overlayered with an intricate web of interlocking meaning.&quot;

===Major themes===
The following represents what some critics regard as important themes in this film.

====Marriage====
The main theme of &quot;Late Spring&quot; is marriage: specifically, the persistent attempts by several characters in the film to get Noriko married. The marriage theme was a topical one for Japanese of the late 1940s. On January 1, 1948, a new law had been issued which allowed young people over twenty to marry consensually without parental permission for the first time. The Japanese Constitution of 1947 had made it much easier for a wife to divorce her husband; up until that time, it had been &quot;difficult, almost impossible&quot; to do so. Several commentators have pointed out that one reason why Noriko is still unmarried at the relatively late age of 27 is that many of the young men of her generation had been killed in the Second World War, leaving far fewer eligible potential partners for single young women.

Marriage in this film, as well as many of Ozu’s late films, is strongly associated with death. Prof. Onodera&#x27;s daughter, for example, refers to marriage as &quot;life’s graveyard.&quot; Geist writes: &quot;Ozu connects marriage and death in obvious and subtle ways in most of his late films… The comparison between weddings and funerals is not merely a clever device on Ozu’s part, but is so fundamental a concept in Japanese culture that these ceremonies as well as those surrounding births have built-in similarities… The elegiac melancholy Ozu evokes at the end of &quot;Late Spring&quot;, &quot;Late Autumn&quot;, and &quot;An Autumn Afternoon&quot; arises only partly because the parents have been left alone… The sadness arises because the marriage of the younger generation inevitably reflects on the mortality of the older generation.&quot; Robin Wood stresses the marriage-death connection in commenting on the scene that takes place in the Somiya home just before the wedding ceremony. &quot;After everyone has left the room… [Ozu] ends the sequence with a shot of the empty mirror. Noriko is no longer even a reflection, she has disappeared from the narrative, she is no longer ‘Noriko’ but ‘wife.’ The effect is that of a death.&quot;

====Tradition vs. modernity====
The tension between tradition and modern pressures in relation to marriage—and, by extension, within Japanese culture as a whole—is one of the major conflicts Ozu portrays in the film. Sorensen indicates by several examples that what foods a character eats or even how he or she sits down (e.g., on tatami mats or Western-style chairs) reveals the relationship of that character to tradition. According to Peña, Noriko &quot;is the quintessential &quot;moga&quot;—&quot;modan gaaru&quot;, &#x27;modern girl&#x27;—that populates Japanese fiction, and really the Japanese imagination, beginning in the 1920s onward.&quot; Throughout most of the film, Noriko wears Western clothing rather than a kimono, and outwardly behaves in up-to-date ways. However, Bordwell asserts that &quot;Noriko is more old-fashioned than her father, insisting that he could not get along without her and resenting the idea that a widower might remarry… she clings to an outmoded notion of propriety.&quot;

The other two important female characters in the film are also defined in terms of their relation to tradition. Noriko’s Aunt Masa appears in scenes in which she is associated with traditional Japan, such as the tea ceremony in one of the ancient temples of Kamakura. Noriko’s friend Aya, on the other hand, seems to reject tradition entirely. Aya had taken advantage of the new liberal divorce laws to end her recent marriage. Thus, she is presented as a new, Westernized phenomenon: the divorcee. She &quot;takes English tea with milk from teacups with handles, [and] also bakes shortcake (&quot;shaato keeki&quot;),&quot; a very un-Japanese type of food.

Like Noriko, her father has an ambiguous relation with modernity. Shukichi is first seen in the film checking the correct spelling of the name of the German-American economist Friedrich List—an important transitional figure during Japan’s Meiji era. (List’s theories helped stimulate the economic modernization of the country.) Prof. Somiya treats Aya, the divorcee, with unfailing courtesy and respect, implying a tolerant, &quot;modern&quot; attitude—though one critic suspects that a man of Shukichi&#x27;s class and generation in the real-life Japan of that period might have been considerably less tolerant.

However, like Aunt Masa, Shukichi is also associated with the traditions of old Japan, such as the city of Kyoto with its ancient temples and Zen rock gardens, and the Noh play that he so clearly enjoys. Most importantly, he pressures Noriko to go through with the &quot;miai&quot; meeting with Satake, though he makes clear to her that she can reject her suitor without negative consequences.

Sorensen has summed up the ambiguous position of both father and daughter in relation to tradition as follows: &quot;Noriko and [Professor] Somiya interpolate between the two extremes, between shortcake and Nara-pickles, between ritually prepared green tea and tea with milk, between love marriage/divorce and arranged marriage, between Tokyo and Nara. And this interpolation is what makes them complex characters, wonderfully human in all their internal inconsistencies, very Ozu-like and likable indeed.&quot;

====The home====
&quot;Late Spring&quot; has been seen by some commentators as a transitional work in terms of the home as a recurring theme in Japanese cinema. Tadao Sato points out that Shochiku’s directors of the 1920s and 1930s—including Shimazu, Gosho, Mikio Naruse and Ozu himself—&quot;presented the family in a tense confrontation with society.&quot; In &quot;A Brother and His Young Sister&quot; (&quot;Ani to sono imoto&quot;, 1939) by Shimazu, for example, &quot;the home is sanctified as a place of warmth and generosity, feelings that were rapidly vanishing in society.&quot; By the early 1940s, however, in such films as Ozu’s &quot;There Was a Father&quot;, &quot;the family [was] completely subordinate to the [wartime] state&quot; and &quot;society is now above criticism.&quot; But when the military state collapsed as a result of Japan’s defeat in the war, the idea of the home collapsed with it: &quot;Neither the nation nor the household could dictate morality any more.&quot;

Sato considers &quot;Late Spring&quot; to be &quot;the next major development in the home drama genre,&quot; because it &quot;initiated a series of Ozu films with the theme: there is no society, only the home. While family members had their own places of activity—office, school, family business—there was no tension between the outside world and the home. As a consequence, the home itself lost its source of moral strength.&quot; Yet despite the fact that these home dramas by Ozu &quot;tend to lack social relevance,&quot; they &quot;came to occupy the mainstream of the genre and can be considered perfect expressions of &#x27;my home-ism,&#x27; whereby one’s family is cherished to the exclusion of everything else.&quot;

====The season and sexuality====
&quot;Late Spring&quot; is the first of several extant Ozu films with a &quot;seasonal&quot; title. (Later films with seasonal titles are &quot;Early Summer&quot;, &quot;Early Spring&quot; (&quot;Soshun&quot;, 1956), &quot;Late Autumn&quot; and &quot;The End of Summer&quot; (literally, &quot;Autumn for the Kohayagawa Family&quot;)). The &quot;late spring&quot; of the title refers on the most obvious level to Noriko who, at 27, is in the &quot;late spring&quot; of her life, and approaching the age at which she would no longer be considered marriageable.
However, there may be another meaning to Ozu&#x27;s title derived from ancient Japanese culture. When Noriko and Shukichi attend the Noh play, the work performed is called &quot;Kakitsubata&quot; or &quot;The Water Iris.&quot; (The water iris in Japan is a plant which blooms, usually in marshland or other moist soil, in mid-to-late-spring.) In this play, a traveling monk arrives at a place called Yatsuhashi, famous for its water irises, when a woman appears. She alludes to a famous poem by the &quot;waka&quot; poet of the Heian period, Ariwara no Narihira, in which each of the five lines begins with one syllable that, spoken together, spell out the word for &quot;water iris&quot; (&quot;ka-ki-tsu-ba-ta&quot;). The monk stays the night at the humble hut of the woman, who then appears in an elaborate kimono and headdress and reveals herself to be the spirit of the water iris. She praises Narihira, dances and at dawn receives enlightenment from the Buddha and disappears.

As Norman Holland explains in an essay on the film, &quot;the iris is associated with late spring, the movie’s title&quot;, and the play contains a great deal of sexual and religious symbolism. The iris&#x27; leaves and flower are traditionally seen as representing the male and female genitalia, respectively. The play itself is traditionally seen, according to Holland, as &quot;a tribute to the union of man and woman leading to enlightenment.&quot;

Noriko calmly accepts this sexual content when couched in the &quot;archaic&quot; form of Noh drama, but when she sees her father nod politely to the attractive widow, Mrs. Miwa, who is also in the audience, &quot;that strikes Noriko as outrageous and outraging. Had this woman and her father arranged to meet at this play about sexuality? Is this remarriage &#x27;filthy&#x27; like [Onodera&#x27;s] remarriage? She feels both angry and despairing. She is so mad at her father that, quite uncharacteristically, she angrily walks away from him after they leave the theater.&quot; Holland thus sees one of the film&#x27;s main themes as &quot;the pushing of traditional and inhibited Noriko into marriage.&quot;

===Major characters===
&quot;Late Spring&quot; has been particularly praised for its focus on character, having been cited as &quot;one of the most perfect, most complete, and most successful studies of character ever achieved in Japanese cinema.&quot; Ozu’s complex approach to character can best be examined through the two protagonists of the film: Noriko Somiya and her father, Shukichi.

====Noriko Somiya====
Noriko, at 27, is an unmarried, unemployed young woman, completely dependent financially upon her father and living (at the film’s beginning) quite contently with him. Her two most important traits, which are interrelated, are her unusually close and affectionate relationship with her father and her extreme reluctance to marry and leave home. Of the first trait, the relationship between father and daughter has been described as a &quot;transgenerational friendship,&quot; in which there is nevertheless no hint of anything incestuous or even inappropriate. However, it has been conceded that this may primarily be due to cultural differences between Japan and the West and that, were the story remade in the West, such a possible interpretation couldn’t be evaded. The second trait, her strong aversion to the idea of marriage, has been seen, by some commentators, in terms of the Japanese concept of &quot;amae&quot;, which in this context signifies the strong emotional dependence of a child on its parent, which can persist into adulthood. Thus, the rupturing of the father-adult daughter relationship in &quot;Late Spring&quot; has been interpreted as Ozu’s view of the inevitability—and necessity—of the termination of the &quot;amae&quot; relationship, although Ozu never glosses over the pain of such a rupture.

There has been considerable difference of opinion amongst commentators regarding the complicated personality of Noriko. She has been variously described as like a wife to her father, or as like a mother to him; as resembling a petulant child; or as being an enigma, particularly as to the issue of whether or not she freely chooses to marry. Even the common belief of film scholars that she is an upholder of conservative values, because of her opposition to her father’s (feigned) remarriage plans, has been challenged. Robin Wood, writing about the three Norikos as one collective character, states that &quot;Noriko&quot; &quot;has managed to retain and develop the finest humane values which the modern capitalist world… tramples underfoot—consideration, emotional generosity, the ability to care and empathize, and above all, awareness.&quot;

====Prof. Shukichi Somiya====
Noriko’s father, Shukichi, works as a college professor and is the sole breadwinner of the Somiya family. It has been suggested that the character represents a transition from the traditional image of the Japanese father to a very different one. Sato points out that the national &quot;prewar&quot; ideal of the father was that of the stern patriarch, who ruled his family lovingly, but with an iron hand. Ozu himself, however, in several prewar films, such as &quot;I Was Born, But…&quot; and &quot;Passing Fancy&quot;, had undercut, according to Sato, this image of the archetypal strong father by depicting parents who were downtrodden &quot;salarymen&quot; (&quot;sarariman&quot;, to use the Japanese term), or poor working-class laborers, who sometimes lost the respect of their rebellious children. Bordwell has noted that &quot;what is remarkable about Ozu&#x27;s work of the 1920s and 1930s is how seldom the patriarchal norm is reestablished at the close [of each film].&quot;

The character of Prof. Somiya represents, according to this interpretation, a further evolution of the “non-patriarchal” patriarch. Although Shukichi wields considerable moral influence over his daughter through their close relationship, that relationship is &quot;strikingly nonoppressive.&quot; One commentator refers to Shukichi and his friend, Professor Onodera, as men who are &quot;very much at peace, very much aware of themselves and their place in the world,&quot; and are markedly different from stereotypes of fierce Japanese males promulgated by American films during and after the World War.

It has been claimed that, after Noriko accepts Satake’s marriage proposal, the film ceases to be about her, and that Prof. Somiya at that point becomes the true protagonist, with the focus of the film shifting to his increasing loneliness and grief. In this regard, a plot change that the filmmakers made from the original source material is significant. In the novel by Kazuo Hirotsu, the father’s announcement to his daughter that he wishes to marry a widow is only &quot;initially&quot; a ruse; eventually, he actually does get married again. Ozu and his co-screenwriter, Noda, deliberately rejected this &quot;witty&quot; ending, in order to show Prof. Somiya as alone and inconsolable at the end.

==Style==
Ozu&#x27;s unique style has been widely noted by critics and scholars. Some have considered it an anti-Hollywood style, as he eventually rejected many conventions of Hollywood filmmaking. Some aspects of the style of &quot;Late Spring&quot;—which also apply to Ozu&#x27;s late-period style in general, as the film is typical in almost all respects—include Ozu&#x27;s use of the camera, his use of actors, his idiosyncratic editing and his frequent employment of a distinctive type of shot that some commentators have called a &quot;pillow shot.&quot;

===Ozu&#x27;s use of the camera===

====Low angle====
Probably the most frequently noted aspect of Ozu&#x27;s camera technique is his consistent use of an extremely low camera position to shoot his subjects, a practice that Bordwell traces as far back as his films of the 1931–1932 period. An example of the low camera in &quot;Late Spring&quot; would be the scene in which Noriko visits her friend Aya in her home. Noriko is in a sitting position, while Aya is seated at a slightly higher elevation, so Aya is looking down towards her friend. However, &quot;the camera angle on both is low. Noriko sits looking up at the standing Aya, but the camera [in the reverse shot] looks up on Noriko&#x27;s face, rejecting Aya&#x27;s point of view. We are thus prevented from identifying with Aya and are forced into an inhuman point of view on Noriko.&quot;

There has been no critical consensus as to why Ozu consistently employed the low camera angle. Bordwell suggests that his motive was primarily visual, because the angle allowed him to create distinctive compositions within the frame and &quot;make every image sharp, stable and striking.&quot; The film historian and critic Donald Richie believed that one of the reasons he used this technique was as a way of &quot;exploiting the theatrical aspect of the Japanese dwelling.&quot; Another critic believes that the ultimate purpose of the low camera position was to allow the audience to assume &quot;a viewpoint of reverence&quot; towards the ordinary people in his films, such as Noriko and her father.

====Static camera====
Ozu was widely noted for a style characterized by a frequent avoidance of the kinds of camera movements—such as panning shots, tracking shots or crane shots—employed by most film directors. (As he himself would sometimes remark, &quot;I&#x27;m not a dynamic director like Akira Kurosawa.&quot;) Bordwell notes that, of all the common technical practices that Ozu refused to emulate, he was &quot;most absolute&quot; in refusing to reframe (for example, by panning slightly) the moving human figure in order to keep it in view; this critic claims that there is not a single reframing in all of Ozu&#x27;s films from 1930 on. In the late films (that is, those from &quot;Late Spring&quot; on), the director &quot;will use walls, screens, or doors to block off the sides of the frame so that people walk into a central depth,&quot; thus maintaining focus on the human figure without any motion of the camera.

The filmmaker would paradoxically retain his static compositions even when a character was shown walking or riding, by moving the camera with a dolly at the precise speed at which the actor or actors moved. He would drive his devoted cameraman, Yuharu Atsuta, to tears by insisting that actors and technicians count their steps precisely during a tracking shot so that the movements of actors and camera could be synchronized. Speaking of the bicycle ride to the beach early in the story, Peña notes: &quot;It’s almost as if Noriko [on her bicycle] doesn’t seem to be moving, or Hattori’s not moving because his place within the frame remains constant… These are the sort of visual idiosyncrasies that make Ozu’s style so interesting and so unique in a way, to give us movement and at the same time to &quot;undercut&quot; movement.&quot;

===Ozu&#x27;s use of actors===
Virtually all actors who worked with Ozu—including Chishu Ryu, who collaborated with the director on almost all his films—agree that he was an extremely demanding taskmaster. He would direct very simple actions by the performer &quot;to the centimeter.&quot; As opposed to those of both Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ozu&#x27;s characters, according to Sato, are &quot;usually calm... they not only move at the same pace but also speak at the same measured rate.&quot; He insisted that his actors express emotions through action, even rote action, rather than by directly expressing their innermost feelings. Once, when the distinguished character actress Haruko Sugimura asked the director what her character was supposed to be feeling at a given moment, Ozu responded, “You are not supposed to feel, you are supposed to do.”

Sugimura, who played Aunt Masa in &quot;Late Spring&quot;, vividly depicted Ozu’s approach to directing actors in her description of the scene in which Noriko is about to leave her father’s house for her wedding:
Ozu told me to come [back] in the room [after she, Hara and Ryu had exited] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu approved it… The reason [Aunt Masa] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s what he was trying to express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. Come to think of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.

===Editing===
According to Richie, the editing of an Ozu film was always subordinate to the script: that is, the rhythm of each scene was decided at the screenwriting stage, and the final editing of the film reflected this. This overriding tempo even determined how the sets were constructed. Sato quotes Tomo Shimogawara, who designed the sets for &quot;The End of Summer&quot; (though the description also clearly applies to other late-period Ozu films, including &quot;Late Spring&quot;): &quot;The size of the rooms was dictated by the time lapses between the actor&#x27;s movements... Ozu would give me instructions on the exact length of the corridor. He explained that it was part and parcel of the tempo of his film, and this flow of tempo Ozu envisioned at the time the script was being written... Since Ozu never used wipes or dissolves, and for the sake of dramatic tempo as well, he would measure the number of seconds it took someone to walk upstairs and so the set had to be constructed accordingly.&quot; Sato says about this tempo that &quot;it is a creation in which time is beautifully apprehended in conformity with the physiology of daily occurrences.&quot;

A striking fact about Ozu&#x27;s late films (of which &quot;Late Spring&quot; is the first instance) is that transitions between scenes are accomplished exclusively through simple cuts. According to one commentator, the lost work, &quot;The Life of an Office Worker&quot; (&quot;Kaishain seikatsu&quot;, 1929), contained a dissolve, and several extant Ozu films of the 1930s (e.g., &quot;Tokyo Chorus&quot; and &quot;The Only Son&quot;) contain some fades. But by the time of &quot;Late Spring&quot;, these were completely eliminated, with only music cues to signal scene changes. (Ozu once spoke of the use of the dissolve as &quot;a form of cheating.&quot;) This self-restraint by the filmmaker is now seen as very modern, because although fades, dissolves and even wipes were all part of common cinematic grammar worldwide at the time of &quot;Late Spring&quot; (and long afterwards), such devices are often considered somewhat &quot;old fashioned&quot; today, when straight cuts are the norm.

===Pillow shots===
Many critics and scholars have commented upon the fact that frequently Ozu, instead of transitioning directly from the end of the opening credits to the first scene, or from one scene to another, interposes a shot or multiple shots—as many as six—of an object, or a group of objects, or a room, or a landscape, often (but not always) devoid of human figures. These units of film have been variously called &quot;curtain shots,&quot; &quot;intermediate spaces,&quot; &quot;empty shots&quot; or, most frequently, &quot;pillow shots&quot; (by analogy with the &quot;pillow words&quot; of classic Japanese verse).

The nature and function of these shots are disputed. Sato (citing the critic Keinosuke Nanbu) compares the shots to the use of the curtain in the Western theatre, that &quot;both present the environment of the next sequence and stimulate the viewer&#x27;s anticipation.&quot; Richie claims that they are a means of presenting only what the characters themselves perceive or think about, to enable us to &quot;experience only what the characters are experiencing.&quot; Bordwell sees it as an expansion of the traditional transitional devices of the &quot;placing shot&quot; and the &quot;cutaway,&quot; using these to convey &quot;a loose notion of &quot;contiguity&quot;.&quot;

Some examples of pillow shots in &quot;Late Spring&quot;—as illustrated on the ozu-san.com website—are: the three shots, immediately after the opening credits, of the Kita-Kamakura railway station, followed by a shot of Kenchoji temple, &quot;one of the five main [Zen] temples in Kamakura,&quot; in which the tea ceremony (the first scene) will take place; the shot immediately after the tea ceremony scene, showing a hillside with several nearly bare trees, which introduces a &quot;tree-motif&quot; associated with Noriko; a shot of a single leafy tree, appearing immediately after the Noh play scene and before the scene depicting Noriko and her father walking together, then separating; and a shot of one of the pagodas of Kyoto during the father and daughter&#x27;s visit to that city late in the film.

====The vase scene====
The most discussed instance of a pillow shot in any Ozu film—indeed, the most famous crux in the director&#x27;s work—is the scene that takes place at an inn in Kyoto, in which a vase figures prominently. During the father and daughter&#x27;s last trip together, after a day sightseeing with Professor Onodera and his wife and daughter, they decide to go to sleep, and lie down on their separate futons on the floor of the inn. Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera&#x27;s new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera&#x27;s remarriage &quot;filthy.&quot; Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found the thought of his own remarriage &quot;distasteful,&quot; she looks over to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be. She looks up towards the ceiling and appears to smile.

There follows a six-second medium shot, in the semidarkness, of a vase on the floor in the same room, in front of a &quot;shōji&quot; screen through which the shadows of leafy branches can be seen. There is a cut back to Noriko, now looking sad and pensive, almost in tears. Then there is a ten-second shot of the same vase, identical to the earlier one, as the music on the soundtrack swells, cuing the next scene (which takes place at the Ryōan-ji rock garden in Kyoto, the following day).

Abé Mark Nornes, in an essay entitled &quot;The Riddle of the Vase: Ozu Yasujirō&#x27;s &quot;Late Spring&quot; (1949),&quot; observes: &quot;Nothing in all of Ozu&#x27;s films has sparked such conflicting explanations; everyone seems compelled to weigh in on this scene, invoking it as a key example in their arguments.&quot; Nornes speculates that the reason for this is the scene&#x27;s &quot;emotional power and its unusual construction. The vase is clearly essential to the scene. The director not only shows it twice, but he lets both shots run for what would be an inordinate amount of time by the measure of most filmmakers.&quot; To one commentator, the vase represents &quot;stasis,&quot; and is thus &quot;an expression of something unified, permanent, transcendent.&quot; Another critic describes the vase and other Ozu &quot;still lifes&quot; as &quot;containers for our emotions.&quot; Yet another specifically disputes this interpretation, identifying the vase as &quot;a non-narrative element wedged into the action.&quot; A fourth scholar sees it as an instance of the filmmaker&#x27;s deliberate use of &quot;false POV&quot; (point of view), since Noriko is never shown actually looking at the vase the audience sees. A fifth asserts that the vase is &quot;a classic feminine symbol.&quot; And yet another suggests several alternative interpretations, including the vase as &quot;a symbol of traditional Japanese culture,&quot; and as an indicator of Noriko&#x27;s &quot;sense that... [her] relationship with her father has been changed.&quot;

The French philosopher-film theorist Gilles Deleuze, in his book &quot;L&#x27;image-temps. Cinéma 2&quot; (&quot;Cinema 2: The Time-Image&quot;, 1985), cited this particular scene as an example of what he referred to as the &quot;time image.&quot; Simply put, Deleuze sees the vase as an image of unchanging time, although objects &quot;within&quot; time (for example, Noriko) do change (e.g., from joy to sadness). &quot;The vase in &quot;Late Spring&quot; is interposed between [Noriko’s] half smile and the beginning of her tears. There is becoming, change, passage. But the form of what changes does not itself change, does not pass on. This is time, time itself, ‘a little bit of time in its pure state’: a direct time-image, which gives what changes the unchanging form in which the change is produced… The still life is time, for everything that changes is in time, but time does not itself change… Ozu&#x27;s still lifes endure, have a duration, over ten seconds of the vase: this duration of the vase is precisely the representation of that which endures, through the succession of changing states.&quot;

==Interpretations==
Like many celebrated works of cinema, &quot;Late Spring&quot; has inspired varied and often contradictory critical and scholarly interpretations. The two most common interpretations of &quot;Late Spring&quot; are: a) the view that the film represents one of a series of Ozu works that depict part of a universal and inevitable &quot;life cycle&quot;, and is thus either duplicated or complemented by other Ozu works in the series; b) the view that the film, while similar in theme and even plot to other Ozu works, calls for a distinct critical approach, and that the work is in fact critical of marriage, or at least the particular marriage depicted in it.

===The film as part of &quot;life cycle&quot; series===
Ozu’s films, both individually and collectively, are often seen as representing either a universal human life cycle or a portion of such a cycle. Ozu himself at least once spoke in such terms. &quot;I wanted in this picture [&quot;Early Summer&quot;] to show a life cycle. I wanted to depict mutability (&quot;rinne&quot;). I was not interested in action for its own sake. And I’ve never worked so hard in my life.&quot;

Those who hold this interpretation argue that this aspect of Ozu&#x27;s work gives it its universality, and helps it transcend the specifically Japanese cultural context in which the films were created. Bock writes: &quot;The subject matter of the Ozu film is what faces all of us born of man and woman and going on to produce offspring of our own: the family… [The terms &quot;shomingeki&quot; or &quot;home drama&quot;] may be applied to Ozu’s works and create an illusion of peculiar Japaneseness, but in fact behind the words are the problems we all face in a life cycle. They are the struggles of self-definition, of individual freedom, of disappointed expectations, of the impossibility of communication, of separation and loss brought about by the inevitable passages of marriage and death.&quot; Bock suggests that Ozu’s wish to portray the life cycle affected his decisions on technical matters, such as the construction and use of the sets of his films. &quot;In employing the set like a curtainless stage Ozu allows for implication of transitoriness in the human condition. Allied with the other aspects of ritual in Ozu&#x27;s techniques, it reinforces the feeling that we are watching a representative life cycle.&quot;

According to Geist, Ozu wished to convey the concept of &quot;sabi&quot;, which she defines as “an awareness of the ephemeral”: &quot;Much of what is ephemeral is also cyclical; thus, &quot;sabi&quot; includes an awareness of the cyclical, which is evinced both formally and thematically in Ozu’s films. Often, they revolve around passages in the human life cycle, usually the marriage of a child or the death of a parent.&quot; She points out scenes that are carefully duplicated in &quot;Late Spring&quot;, evoking this cyclical theme: &quot;Noriko and her father’s friend [Onodera] sit in a bar and talk about [Onodera’s] remarriage, which Noriko condemns. In the film’s penultimate sequence, the father and Noriko’s friend Aya sit in a bar after Noriko’s wedding. The scene is shot from exactly the same angles as was the first bar scene, and again the subject is remarriage.&quot;

===The film as a critique of marriage===
A critical tendency opposing the &quot;life cycle&quot; theory emphasizes the &quot;differences&quot; in tone and intent between this film and other Ozu works that deal with similar themes, situations and characters. These critics are also highly skeptical of the widely held notion that Ozu regarded marriage (or at least the marriage in &quot;Late Spring&quot;) favorably. As critic Roger Ebert explains, &quot;&quot;Late Spring&quot; began a cycle of Ozu films about families... Did he make the same film again and again? Not at all. &quot;Late Spring&quot; and &quot;Early Summer&quot; are startlingly different. In the second, Noriko takes advantage of a conversational opening [about marriage] to overturn the entire plot... she accepts a man [as husband] she has known for a long time—a widower with a child.&quot; In contrast, &quot;what happens [in &quot;Late Spring&quot;] at deeper levels is angry, passionate and—wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness.&quot; Ebert goes on, &quot;It is universally believed, just as in a Jane Austen novel, that a woman of a certain age is in want of a husband. &quot;Late Spring&quot; is a film about two people who desperately do not believe this, and about how they are undone by their tact, their concern for each other, and their need to make others comfortable by seeming to agree with them.&quot; The film &quot;tells a story that becomes sadder the more you think about it.&quot; Ebert included the film in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list.

&quot;Late Spring&quot;, in Wood&#x27;s view, &quot;is about the sacrifice of Noriko’s happiness in the interest of maintaining and continuing &#x27;tradition,&#x27; [which sacrifice] takes the form of her marriage, and everyone in the film—including the father and finally the defeated Noriko herself—is complicit in it.&quot; He asserts that, in contradiction to the view of many critics, the film &quot;is not about a young woman trying nobly to sacrifice herself and her own happiness in order dutifully to serve her widowed father in his lonely old age,&quot; because her life as a single young woman is one she clearly prefers: &quot;With her father, Noriko has a freedom that she will never again regain.&quot; He points out that there is an unusual (for Ozu) degree of camera movement in the first half of the film, as opposed to the &quot;stasis&quot; of the second half, and that this corresponds to Noriko’s freedom in the first half and the &quot;trap&quot; of her impending marriage in the second. Rather than perceiving the Noriko films as a &quot;cycle&quot;, Wood asserts that the trilogy is &quot;unified by its underlying progressive movement, a progression from the unqualified tragedy of &quot;Late Spring&quot; through the ambiguous &#x27;happy ending&#x27; of &quot;Early Summer&quot; to the authentic and fully earned note of bleak and tentative hope at the end of &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

===Reception and reputation of the film in Japan===
&quot;Late Spring&quot; was released in Japan on September 19, 1949. Basing his research upon files kept on the film by the Allied censorship, Sorensen notes: &quot;Generally speaking, [the film] was hailed with enthusiasm by Japanese critics when it opened at theaters.&quot; The publication &quot;Shin Yukan&quot;, in its review of September 20, emphasized the scenes that take place in Kyoto, describing them as embodying &quot;the calm Japanese atmosphere&quot; of the entire work. Both &quot;Shin Yukan&quot; and another publication, &quot;Tokyo Shinbun&quot; (in its review of September 26), considered the film beautiful and the former called it a &quot;masterpiece.&quot; There were, however, some cavils: the critic of &quot;Asahi Shinbun&quot; (September 23) complained that &quot;the tempo is not the feeling of the present period&quot; and the reviewer from &quot;Hochi Shinbun&quot; (September 21) warned that Ozu should choose more progressive themes, or else he would &quot;coagulate.&quot;

In 1950, the film became the fifth Ozu work overall, and the first of the postwar period, to top the &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; poll, making it the Japanese critics&#x27; Best Film of 1949. In addition, that year the film won four prizes at the distinguished Mainichi Film Awards, sponsored by the newspaper &quot;Mainichi Shinbun&quot;: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Setsuko Hara, who was also honored for two other films in which she appeared in 1949).

In a 2009 poll by &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; of the best Japanese films of all time, nine Ozu films appeared. &quot;Late Spring&quot; was the second highest-rated film, tying for 36th place. (The highest-ranking of his films was &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;, which topped the list.)

Ozu&#x27;s younger contemporary, Akira Kurosawa, in 1999 published a conversation with his daughter Kazuko in which he provided his unranked personal listing, in chronological order, of the top 100 films, both Japanese and non-Japanese, of all time. One of the works he selected was &quot;Late Spring&quot;, with the following comment: &quot;[Ozu&#x27;s] characteristic camera work was imitated by many directors abroads [sic] as well, i.e., many people saw and see Mr. Ozu’s movies, right? That’s good. Indeed, one can learn pretty much from his movies. Young prospective movie makers in Japan should, I hope, see more of Ozu’s work. Ah, it was really good times when Mr. Ozu, Mr. Naruse and/or Mr. Mizoguchi were all making movies!&quot;

===Reception and reputation of the film outside Japan===
New Yorker Films released the film in North America on July 21, 1972. A newspaper clipping, dated August 6, 1972, indicates that, of the New York-based critics of the time, six (Stuart Byron of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Charles Michener of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Archer Winsten of &quot;The New York Post&quot;, Judith Crist of The Today Show and Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot;) gave the work a favorable review, and one critic (John Simon of &quot;New York&quot;) gave it a &quot;mixed&quot; review.

Canby observed that &quot;the difficulty with Ozu is not in appreciating his films... [but] in describing an Ozu work in a way that doesn&#x27;t diminish it, that doesn&#x27;t reduce it to an inventory of his austere techniques, and that accurately reflects the unsentimental humanism of this discipline.&quot; He called the characters played by Ryu and Hara &quot;immensely affecting—gentle, loving, amused, thinking and feeling beings,&quot; and praised the filmmaker for his &quot;profound respect for [the characters&#x27;] privacy, for the mystery of their emotions. Because of this—not in spite of this—his films, of which &quot;Late Spring&quot; is one of the finest, are so moving.&quot;

Stuart Byron of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called &quot;Late Spring&quot; &quot;Ozu’s greatest achievement and, thus, one of the ten best films of all time.&quot;

In &quot;Variety&quot;, reviewer Robert B. Frederick (under the pseudonym &quot;Robe&quot;) also had high praise for the work. &quot;Although made in 1949,&quot; he wrote, &quot;this infrequently-seen example of the cinematic mastery of the late Yasujirō Ozu... compares more than favorably with any major Japanese film... A heartwarming and very worthy cinematic effort.&quot;

Modern genre critics equally reviewed the film positively, giving the film an aggregate score of 100% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 24 reviews, with an average score of 9.00/10. Kurosawa biographer Stuart Galbraith IV, reviewing the Criterion Collection DVD, called the work &quot;archetypal postwar Ozu&quot; and &quot;a masterful distillation of themes its director would return to again and again... There are better Ozu films, but &quot;Late Spring&quot; impressively boils the director&#x27;s concerns down to their most basic elements.&quot; Norman Holland concludes that &quot;Ozu has created—in the best Japanese manner—a film explicitly beautiful but rich in ambiguity and the unexpressed.&quot; Dennis Schwartz calls it &quot;a beautiful drama,&quot; in which &quot;there&#x27;s nothing artificial, manipulative or sentimental.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 112 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.

Leonard Maltin awarded the film four out of four stars, calling it &quot;A transcendent and profoundly moving work rivaling &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; as the director&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot;
On August 1, 2012, the British Film Institute (BFI) published its decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; &quot;Greatest Films of All Time&quot; poll, one of the most widely respected such polls among fans and scholars A total of 846 &quot;critics, programmers, academics, distributors, writers and other cinephiles&quot; submitted Top Ten lists for the poll. In that listing, &quot;Late Spring&quot; appeared in 15th place among all films from the dawn of cinema. It was the second-highest ranking Japanese-language film on the list. (Ozu&#x27;s own &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; appeared in third place. Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was the third-highest ranking Japanese-language film on the list, tied at 17th place.) In the previous BFI poll (2002), &quot;Late Spring&quot; did not appear either on the critics&#x27; or the directors&#x27; &quot;Top Ten&quot; lists. The film ranked 53rd in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209
film critics from 43 countries around the world.

===Films inspired by &quot;Late Spring&quot;===
Only one remake of &quot;Late Spring&quot; has so far been filmed: a television movie, produced to celebrate Ozu&#x27;s centennial, entitled &quot;A Daughter&#x27;s Marriage&quot; (&quot;Musume no kekkon&quot;), directed by the distinguished filmmaker Kon Ichikawa and produced by the Japanese pay television channel WOWOW. It was broadcast on December 14, 2003, two days after the 100th anniversary of Ozu&#x27;s birth (and 40th anniversary of his death). Ichikawa, a younger contemporary of Ozu&#x27;s, was 88 years old at the time of the broadcast. The film recreated various idiosyncrasies of the late director&#x27;s style. For example, Ichikawa included many shots with vividly red objects, in imitation of Ozu&#x27;s well-known fondness for red in his own color films (although &quot;Late Spring&quot; was not itself shot in color).

In addition, a number of works wholly or partly inspired by the original 1949 film have been released over the years. These works can be divided into three types: variations (directed by Ozu himself), homages (by directors other than Ozu), and at least one parody.

The most obvious variation of &quot;Late Spring&quot; in Ozu&#x27;s own work is &quot;Late Autumn&quot;, which deals again with a daughter who reacts negatively to the (false) rumor of the remarriage of a parent—this time a mother (Setsuko Hara) rather than a father—and ultimately gets married herself. One scholar refers to this film as &quot;a version of &quot;Late Spring&quot;.&quot;, while another describes it as &quot;a revision of &quot;Late Spring&quot;, with Akiko (played by Hara, the daughter in the earlier film) taking the father&#x27;s role.&quot; Other Ozu films also contain plot elements first established by the 1949 film, though somewhat altered. For example, the 1958 film &quot;Equinox Flower&quot; (&quot;Higanbana&quot;), the director&#x27;s first ever in color, focuses on a marriageable daughter, though as one scholar points out, the plot is a &quot;reversal&quot; of &quot;Late Spring&quot; in that the father at first opposes his daughter&#x27;s marriage.

The French director Claire Denis has acknowledged that her critically acclaimed 2008 film &quot;35 Shots of Rum&quot; (&quot;35 Rhums&quot;) is a homage to Ozu. &quot;This film is also a sort of... not copy, but it has stolen a lot to [sic] a famous Ozu film called &quot;Late Spring&quot;… [Ozu] was trying to show through few characters… the relation between human beings.&quot;

Because of perceived similarities, in subject matter and in his contemplative approach, to the Japanese master, Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien has been called &quot;an artistic heir to Ozu.&quot; In 2003, to celebrate Ozu&#x27;s centennial, Shochiku, the studio where Ozu worked throughout his career, commissioned Hou to make a film in tribute. The resulting work, &quot;Café Lumière&quot; (&quot;Kōhī Jikō&quot;, 2003), has been called, &quot;in its way, a version of the &quot;Late Spring&quot; story, updated to the early 21st Century.&quot; However, unlike the virginal Noriko, the heroine of the Hou film, Yoko, &quot;lives on her own, is independent of her family, and has no intention of marrying just because she&#x27;s pregnant.&quot;

An offbeat Japanese variant, the 2003 film &quot;A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn&quot; (&quot;Chikan gifu: Musuko no yome to...&quot;, also known as &quot;A Cow at Daybreak&quot;, &quot;Cowshed of Immorality&quot;, or &quot;Father in Law&quot;), belongs to the Japanese &quot;pinku&quot; (pink film) genre of softcore films. The drama tells the story of a senile farmer (named Shukichi) who enjoys a bizarrely sexualized relationship with his daughter-in-law (named Noriko). The director, Daisuke Goto, claims that the film was strongly influenced by, among other works, &quot;Late Spring&quot;.

Perhaps the strangest tribute of all is yet another &quot;pink&quot; film, &quot;Abnormal Family&quot;, also known as &quot;Spring Bride&quot; or &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot; (&quot;Hentai kazoku: Aniki no yomesan&quot;, 1983), director Masayuki Suo&#x27;s first film. It has been called &quot;perhaps the only film that ever replicated Ozu’s style down to the most minute detail. The story, style, characters, and settings constantly invoke Ozu’s iconography, and especially &quot;Late Spring.&quot;&quot; As in Ozu&#x27;s classic, the narrative has a wedding which is never shown on screen and Suo consistently imitates the older master&#x27;s &quot;much posited predilection for carefully composed static shots from a low camera angle... affectionately poking fun at the restrained and easy going &#x27;life goes on&#x27; philosophy of its model.&quot; Nornes indicates that this film is significant because it points up the fact that Ozu&#x27;s films are enjoyed in different ways by two different audiences: as emotion-laden family stories by general audiences, and as exercises in cinematic style by sophisticated film fans.

==Home media==
&quot;Late Spring&quot; was released on VHS in an English-subtitled version by New Yorker Video in November 1994.

In 2003, Shochiku marked the centennial of Ozu&#x27;s birth by releasing a Region 2 DVD of the film in Japan (with no English subtitles). In the same year, the Hong Kong-based distributor Panorama released a Region 0 (worldwide) DVD of the film, in NTSC format, but with English and Chinese subtitles.

In 2004, Bo Ying, a Chinese distributor, released a Region 0 DVD of &quot;Late Spring&quot; in NTSC format with English, Chinese and Japanese subtitles. In 2005, Tartan released a Region 0, English-subtitled DVD of the film, in PAL format, as Volume One of its Triple Digipak series of Ozu&#x27;s Noriko Trilogy.

In 2006, The Criterion Collection released a two-disc set with a restored high-definition digital transfer and new subtitle translations. It also includes &quot;Tokyo-Ga&quot;, an Ozu tribute by director Wim Wenders; an audio commentary by Richard Peña; and essays by Michael Atkinson and Donald Richie. In 2009, the Australian distributor Madman Entertainment released an English-subtitled Region 4 DVD of the film in PAL format.

In June 2010, BFI released the film on Region B-locked Blu-ray. The release includes a 24-page illustrated booklet as well as Ozu&#x27;s earlier film &quot;The Only Son&quot;, also in HD, and a DVD copy of both films (in Region 2 and PAL). In April 2012, Criterion released a Blu-ray version of the film. This release contains the same supplements as Criterion&#x27;s DVD version.

<doc id="846333" wikidata="Q1322791" url="?curid=846333" title="Little Joe (rocket)">
<text>Little Joe was a solid-fueled booster rocket used by NASA for eight launches from 1959 to 1961 from Wallops Island, Virginia to test the launch escape system and heat shield for Project Mercury capsules, as well as the name given to the test program using the booster. The first rocket designed solely for crewed spacecraft qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle.

The Little Joe name has been attributed to Maxime Faget at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. He based the name on four large fins which reminded him of a slang term for a roll of four in craps.

A successor, Little Joe II, was used for flight testing of the Apollo launch escape system from 1963 to 1966.

== Background ==

When NASA needed a booster for Project Mercury, the agency found that the Atlas rockets would cost approximately US$2.5 million each and that even the Redstone would cost about $1 million per launch. The managers of the Mercury program recognized that the numerous early test flights would have to be accomplished by a far less expensive booster system, so NASA designed the Little Joe rocket which cost $200,000 each.

In January 1958, Max Faget and Paul Purser had worked out in considerable detail on paper how to cluster four of the solid-fuel Sergeant rockets, in standard use at the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, to boost a crewed nose cone above the stratosphere. Faget&#x27;s short-lived &quot;High Ride&quot; proposal had suffered from comparisons with &quot;Project Adam&quot; at that time, but in August 1958 William Bland and Ronald Kolenkiewicz had returned to their preliminary designs for a cheap cluster of solid rockets to boost full-scale and full-weight model capsules above the atmosphere. As drop tests of boilerplate capsules provided new aerodynamic data on the dynamic stability of the configuration in free-fall, the need for comparable data on the powered phase quickly became apparent. So in October 1958, a NASA team prepared new engineering layouts and estimates for the mechanical design of the booster structure and a suitable launcher.

As the blueprints for this cluster of four rockets began to emerge from their drawing boards, the designers&#x27; nickname for their project gradually was adopted. Since their first cross-section drawings showed four holes, they called the project &quot;Little Joe,&quot; from the craps throw of a double deuce on the dice. Although four smaller circles were added later to represent the addition of Recruit rocket motors, the original name stuck. The appearance on engineering drawings of the four large stabilizing fins protruding from its airframe also helped to perpetuate the name Little Joe had acquired.

The primary purpose of this relatively small and simple booster system was to save money—by allowing numerous test flights to qualify various solutions to the myriad problems associated with the development of crewed space flight, especially the problem of escaping from an explosion at or during launch. Capsule aerodynamics under actual reentry conditions was another primary concern. To gain this kind of experience as soon as possible, its designers had to keep the clustered booster simple in concept; it should use solid fuel and existing proven equipment whenever possible, and should be free of any electronic guidance and control systems.

The designers made the Little Joe booster assembly to approximate the same performance that the Army&#x27;s Redstone booster would have with the capsule payload. But in addition to being flexible enough to perform a variety of missions, Little Joe could be made for about one-fifth the basic cost of the Redstone, would have much lower operating costs, and could be developed and delivered with much less time and effort. And, unlike the larger launch vehicles, Little Joe could be shot from the existing facilities at Wallops Island.

==Launch vehicle development==

Twelve companies responded during November 1958 to the invitations for bids to construct the airframe of Little Joe. The technical evaluation of these proposals was carried on in much the same manner as for the spacecraft, except that Langley Research Center itself carried the bulk of the administrative load. The Missile Division of North American Aviation won the contract on December 29, 1958; and began work immediately in Downey, California, on its order for seven booster airframes and one mobile launcher.

The primary mission objectives for Little Joe as seen in late 1958 (in addition to studying the capsule dynamics at progressively higher altitudes) were to test the capsule escape system at maximum dynamic pressure, to qualify the parachute system, and to verify search and retrieval methods. But since each group of specialists at work on the project sought to acquire firm empirical data as soon as possible, more exact priorities had to be established. The first flights were to secure measurements of inflight and impact forces on the capsule; later flights were to measure critical parameters at the progressively higher altitudes of 20,000, 250,000, and 500,000 feet (6, 75, and 150 km). The minimum aims of each Little Joe shot could be supplemented from time to time with studies of noise levels, heat and pressure loads, heat shield separation, and the behavior of animal riders, so long as the measurements could be accomplished with minimum telemetry. Since all the capsules boosted by the Little Joe rockets were expected to be recovered, onboard recording techniques would also contribute to the simplicity of the system.

The first of only two booster systems designed specifically and solely for crewed capsule qualifications, Little Joe was also one of the pioneer operational launch vehicles using the rocket cluster principle. Since the four modified Sergeants (called either Castor or Pollux rockets, depending upon modification) and four supplemental Recruit rockets were arranged to fire in various sequences, the takeoff thrust varied greatly, but maximum design thrust was almost 230,000 pounds (1,020 kilonewtons). Theoretically enough to lift a spacecraft of about 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) on a ballistic path over 100 miles (160 km) high, the push of these clustered main engines should simulate the takeoff profile in the environment that the crewed Atlas would experience. Furthermore, the additional powerful explosive pull of the tractor-rocket escape system could be demonstrated under the most severe takeoff conditions imaginable. The engineers who mothered Little Joe to maturity knew it was not much to look at, but they hoped that their ungainly rocket would prove the legitimacy of most of the ballistic capsule design concepts, thereby earning its own honor. A successor, Little Joe II, would later be used for flight testing of the Apollo crew escape system.

==Flights==

As of 21 January 1960, the Little Joe series of five actual and attempted flights had expended four of the six test boosters North American had made for NASA and five prototype capsules made in the Langley shops. The primary test objectives for these solid-fuel-boosted models were an integral part of the development flight program conducted within NASA by the Space Task Group, with Langley and Wallops support. Now only two Little Joe boosters remained for the qualification flight tests. North American had manufactured seven Little Joe airframes, but one of these had been retained at the plant in Downey, California, for static loading tests. STG ordered the refurbishment of this seventh airframe so as to have three Little Joe boosters for the qualification flight program. The success of Little Joe 1B in January 1960 meant that the next flight, the sixth, to be known as Little Joe 5, would be the first to fly a real Mercury capsule from the McDonnell production line. In passing from development flight tests with boilerplate models to qualification flight tests with the &quot;real McDonnell&quot; capsule, the Space Task Group moved further away from research into the development and toward operations. 
== Mission numbering ==
The official Mercury mission numbering designation was a two-letter designation that corresponded to the launch vehicle type, followed by a dash then a digit indicating the particular set of flight objectives, and an optional letter used to distinguish further flights to accomplish those objectives. So the official designation for the first Little Joe flight was &quot;LJ-1.&quot; Flights did not occur in numeric sequence as the project schedule was adapted as it progressed. The actual flight order was:

<text>is a 1953 Japanese drama film directed by Yasujirō Ozu and starring Chishū Ryū and Chieko Higashiyama, about an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children.

Upon release, it did not immediately gain international recognition and was considered &quot;too Japanese&quot; to be marketable by Japanese film exporters. It was screened in 1957 in London, where it won the inaugural Sutherland Trophy the following year, and received praise from U.S. film critics after a 1972 screening in New York City.

&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; is widely regarded as Ozu&#x27;s masterpiece and one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. It was voted the greatest film of all time in the 2012 edition of a poll of film directors by &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine.

==Plot summary==
Retired couple Shūkichi and Tomi Hirayama live in Onomichi in western Japan with their daughter Kyōko, a primary school teacher. They have five adult children, four of whom are living. The couple travel to Tokyo to visit their son, daughter, and widowed daughter-in-law.

Their eldest son, Kōichi, is a physician who runs a small clinic in Tokyo&#x27;s suburbs, and their eldest daughter, Shige, runs a hairdressing salon. Kōichi and Shige are both busy and do not have much time for their parents. Only their widowed daughter-in-law, Noriko, the wife of their middle son Shōji, who was missing in action and presumed dead during the Pacific War, goes out of her way to entertain them. She takes time from her demanding office job to take Shūkichi and Tomi on a sightseeing tour of metropolitan Tokyo.

Feeling conflicted that they do not have time to entertain them, Kōichi and Shige pay for their parents to stay at a hot spring spa at Atami, but they return early because the nightlife disturbs their sleep. Tomi also has an unexplained dizzy spell. Upon returning, a frustrated Shige explains she sent them to Atami because she wanted to use their bedroom for a meeting; the elderly couple has to leave for the evening. They spend the afternoon in Ueno Park before splitting up to seek accommodations for the night. Tomi goes to stay with Noriko, with whom she deepens their emotional bond, and advises her to remarry. Shūkichi, meanwhile, gets drunk with some old friends from Onomichi. The three men drunkenly ramble about their children and lives. A policeman brings Shūkichi and one of his friends to Shige&#x27;s salon. Shige is outraged her father is lapsing into the alcoholic ways that overshadowed her childhood.

The couple remarks on how their children have changed, returning home earlier than planned, intending to see their younger son Keizō when the train stops in Osaka. However, Tomi suddenly becomes ill during the journey and they decide to disembark the train, staying until she feels better the next day. They return to Onomichi, and Tomi falls critically ill. Kōichi, Shige, and Noriko rush to Onomichi to see Tomi, who dies shortly afterwards. Keizō arrives too late, as he has been away on business.

After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige, and Keizō leave immediately; only Noriko remains. After they leave, Kyōko criticises her siblings over their selfishness toward their parents. She believes that Kōichi, Shige, and Keizō do not care how hard it will be for their father now that he has lost their mother. She is also upset at Shige for asking so quickly for Tomi&#x27;s clothes as keepsakes. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyōko&#x27;s disappointment, everyone has their own life and the growing chasm between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyōko not to be too hard on her siblings because one day she will understand how hard it is to take time away from one&#x27;s own life.

After Kyōko leaves for school, Noriko informs her father-in-law that she must return to Tokyo that afternoon. Shūkichi tells her that she has treated them better than their own children despite not being a blood relation. Noriko protests that she is selfish and has not always thought about her missing husband, and Shūkichi credits her self-assessment to humility. He gives her a watch from the late Tomi as a memento. Noriko cries and confesses her loneliness; Shūkichi encourages her to remarry as soon as possible, wanting her to be happy. Noriko travels from Onomichi back to Tokyo, contemplating the watch, while Shūkichi remains behind, resigned to the solitude he must endure.

==Production==

&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was inspired by the 1937 American film &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot;, directed by Leo McCarey, which it loosely adapts to the Japanese context and Ozu’s style. Noda, a long-time collaborator of Ozu, initially suggested the plot of the older film to Ozu, who had not seen it. Noda remembered it from its initial release in Japan. Both films depict an elderly couple, their problems with family and travelling to visit their children. Differences include the older film taking place in Depression-era US, with the couple&#x27;s problem being economical and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; taking place in post-war Japan, where the problems are cultural and emotional. The films end differently. David Bordwell wrote that Ozu &quot;re-cast&quot; the original film instead of adapting it.

The script was developed by Ozu and Noda over a period of 103 days in a ryokan called &quot;Chigasakikan&quot; in Chigasaki, Kanagawa. Ozu, Noda and cinematographer Yūharu Atsuta scouted locations in Tokyo and Onomichi for another month before shooting started. Shooting and editing took place from July to October 1953. Filming locations were in Tokyo (Adachi, Chūō, Taitō and Chiyoda), Onomichi, Atami and Osaka. Among the major cast members only Ryū, Hara and Kagawa participated in the Onomichi location. All indoor scenes, except those at the Tokyo Station waiting area and in a passenger car, were shot at the Shochiku Ōfuna Studio in Kamakura, Kanagawa. Ozu used the same film crew and actors he had worked with for many years. Actor Chishū Ryū said Ozu was always happiest when finishing the final draft of a script and there were never any changes to the final draft.

==Style and themes==
Like all of Ozu&#x27;s sound films, &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;&#x27;s pacing is slow, though Ozu called it his film &quot;that tends most strongly to melodrama.&quot; In his narrative storytelling, Ozu often had certain key scenes take place off camera, with the viewer only learning about them through the characters&#x27; dialogue. For example, the train journeys to and from Tokyo are not depicted, the audience never sees Shūkichi and Tomi visit their son Keizō, and Tomi&#x27;s illness begins off-screen. 

Ozu favored a stationary camera and believed strongly in minimalism. A distinctive camera style is used, in which the camera height is low and almost never moves; film critic Roger Ebert noted that the camera moves once in the film, which is &quot;more than usual&quot; for an Ozu film. The low camera positions are reminiscent of sitting on a traditional Japanese tatami mat. Ozu rarely shot master shots and often broke the 180-degree rule of filmmaking and screen direction. Characters, who often sit side by side in scenes, often appear to be facing the same direction when speaking to each other, such as in the first scene with Shūkichi and Tomi. During some transitions, characters exit a scene screen right and then enter the next scene screen right.

David Desser has compared the film&#x27;s style and &quot;de-emphasized plot&quot; to Zen Buddhism and the modern world&#x27;s fascination with surface value and materialism. Many of the transitional shots are still lifes of non-human subjects, such as smokestacks and landscapes.

Themes in the film include the break-up and Westernization of the traditional Japanese family after World War II and the inevitability of children growing apart from their parents. It contrasts the urban life of the children in Tokyo with the rural life of their parents. The film takes place in 1953 post-war Japan, a few years after the new Civil Code of 1948 stimulated the country&#x27;s rapid re-growth and embraced Western capitalist ideals, while simultaneously destroying older traditions such as the Japanese family and its values. Ozu was very close to his own mother, living with her as a surrogate wife and never marrying. It is considered a Shomin-geki film for its depiction of ordinary people.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was released on November 3, 1953, in Japan. The following year Haruko Sugimura won the Mainichi Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the eldest daughter Shige.

It was screened at the National Film Theatre in London in 1957. It is Ozu&#x27;s best known film in both the East and the West. After the success of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; at the 1951 Venice Film Festival, Japanese films began getting international distribution. However, Japanese film exporters considered Ozu&#x27;s work &quot;too Japanese&quot; and unmarketable. It was not until the 1960s that Ozu&#x27;s films began to be screened in New York City at film festivals, museums, and theaters.

In 1958, it was awarded the first Sutherland Trophy for the most original and creative film. UK critic Lindsay Anderson wrote that &quot;It is a film about relationships, a film about time, and how it affects human beings (particularly parents and children) and how we must reconcile ourselves to its workings.&quot;

After a screening at the New Yorker Theatre in 1972, it received rave reviews from prominent critics who were unfamiliar with the film or Ozu. Charles Micherer of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said it was &quot;like a Japanese paper flower that is dropped into water and then swells to fill the entire container with its beauty.&quot; Stanley Kauffmann put it on his 10 Best list of 1972 and wrote &quot;Ozu, a lyrical poet, whose lyrics swell quietly into the epic.&quot;

===Box office===
In Japan, it was the eighth highest-grossing film of 1953 with in distributor rental earnings. In France, the film sold 84,646 tickets upon release in 1978. In other European countries, the film sold 92,810 tickets between 1996 and 2021, for a combined tickets sold in Europe.

===Critical reception===
 It is also jointly ranked #1 on Metacritic&#x27;s Filtered &quot;Best Movies of All Time&quot;. John Walker, former editor of the &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guides&quot;, places &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; at the top of his published list of the best 1000 films ever made. &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; is also included in film critic Derek Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;The Century of Films&quot;, a list of films which he deems artistically or culturally important, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine lists it among its All-Time 100 Movies.
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; included it in his series of great movies, and Paul Schrader placed it in the &quot;Gold&quot; section of his Film Canon. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot;

Arthur Nolletti Jr, writing an essay in the book titled &quot;Ozu&#x27;s Tokyo Story&quot; compared the film to its USA predecessor film, McCarey&#x27;s 1937 &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot;, and indicates that: &quot;David Bordwell sees Ozu as &#x27;recasting&#x27; the American film – borrowing from it, adapting it – and briefly mentions that there are similarities in story, theme and plot structure. Indeed these similarities are striking. Both films focus on an elderly couple who discover that their grown children regard them as a burden; both films are structured as journeys in which the couple are shuffled from one household to another; both films explore much of the same thematic material (e.g., sibling self-centeredness and parental disillusionment); and both films are about the human condition – the cyclical pattern of life with its concomitant joys and sorrows – and the immediate social realities that affect and shape that condition: in McCarey&#x27;s film, The Great Depression; in Ozu&#x27;s, the intensified postwar push toward industrialization. Primarily sober in tone but possessing rich and gentle humor, both films belong to a genre that in Japanese cinema is called &quot;shomin-geki&quot;, films dealing with the everyday lives of the lower middle classes.&quot;

&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; is often admired as a work that achieves great emotional effect while avoiding melodrama. Critic Wally Hammond stated that &quot;the way Ozu builds up emotional empathy for a sense of disappointment in its various characters is where his mastery lies.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote that the work &quot;lacks sentimental triggers and contrived emotion; it looks away from moments a lesser movie would have exploited. It doesn&#x27;t want to force our emotions, but to share its understanding.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Eric Hynes argued that &quot;time itself is [Ozu]&#x27;s most potent weapon. Protracted sequences make you impatient for forward motion, but then, in an instant, you’re left to mourn beauties hastened away.&quot; In 2010, David Thomson rhetorically asked whether any other family drama in cinematic history was more moving than &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. Ebert called Ozu &quot;universal&quot;, reported having never heard more weeping in an audience than during its showing, and later stated that the work &quot;ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 36 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.

&quot;Tokyo Story&quot; was voted at No. 14 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; in 2008. In 2009 the film was named &quot;The Greatest Japanese Film of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 95th Greatest film of all time. Since 1992, the film has appeared consistently in the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;polls of the greatest films&quot; of directors and critics published in &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;. On the critics&#x27; poll, it was third in 1992, fifth in 2002, and third again in 2012. On the directors&#x27; poll, it was 17th in 1992, tied at number 16 with &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Mirror&quot; in 2002, and in 2012 it topped the poll, receiving 48 votes out of the 358 directors polled. In 2022, it was 4th in both the critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls. In 2010, The Guardian ranked the film 4th in its list of 25 greatest arthouse films. It ranked 3rd in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films voted by 209 
film critics from 43 countries around the world.

==Influence==
German director Doris Dörrie drew inspiration from &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; for her 2008 film &quot;Cherry Blossoms&quot;, which follows a similar storyline.

In 2013 Yōji Yamada remade the film as &quot;Tōkyō Kazoku&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was restored and released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection (Region 1) and by Tartan Video in Region 2. In 2010, the BFI released a Region 2 dual-format edition (Blu-ray + DVD). Included with this release is a standard-definition presentation of &quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family&quot;.

<text>Aeneas Tacticus (; fl. 4th century BC) was one of the earliest Greek writers on the art of war and is credited as the first author to provide a complete guide to securing military communications. Polybius described his design for a hydraulic semaphore system.
According to Aelianus Tacticus and Polybius, he wrote a number of treatises () on the subject. The only extant one, &quot;How to Survive under Siege&quot; (, ), deals with the best methods of defending a fortified city. An epitome of the whole was made by Cineas, minister of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. The work is chiefly valuable as containing a large number of historical illustrations.

Aeneas was considered by Isaac Casaubon to have been a contemporary of Xenophon and identical with the Arcadian general Aeneas of Stymphalus, whom Xenophon (&quot;Hellenica&quot;, vii.3) mentions as fighting at the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC).

<text>is a 1958 color Japanese film directed by Yasujirō Ozu which is based on a novel by Ton Satomi.

==Plot==
Wataru Hirayama (Shin Saburi) is a wealthy Tokyo businessman. When an old schoolmate Mikami (Chishū Ryū) approaches him for help concerning his daughter Fumiko (Yoshiko Kuga), who has run off owing to a conflict with her father, he agrees. Finding her in a bar where she now works, he listens to her side of the story. Fumiko complains that her father is stubborn, insisting on arranging her marriage, whereas she has now fallen in love with a musician and is adamant to lead life her own way.

One day during work, a young man named Masahiko Taniguchi (Keiji Sada) approaches Hirayama to ask for the hand of his elder daughter, Setsuko (Ineko Arima). Hirayama is extremely unhappy that his daughter has made wedding plans on her own. He confronts her at home and says that she must not go to work until she sees the folly of her ways. Hirayama tries to find out more about Taniguchi from his subordinate.

Owing to the standoff, his daughter&#x27;s friend Yukiko (Fujiko Yamamoto) tries a ruse in which she asks Hirayama&#x27;s opinion concerning a similar situation – her mother forcing her to marry someone she didn&#x27;t like. When Hirayama advises her to ignore her mother, Yukiko reveals it is all a setup and states that Hirayama has just given his consent to Setsuko&#x27;s marriage.

Despite the ruse, Hirayama remains unchanged and Hirayama&#x27;s wife Kiyoko (Kinuyo Tanaka) accuses her husband of being &quot;inconsistent&quot;. Even his younger daughter Hisako (Miyuki Kuwano) is on the side of her sister, finding her father too old-fashioned. Finally, after the couple&#x27;s insistence on getting married, Hirayama decides to give in by attending his daughter&#x27;s wedding.

After the wedding, Mikami reveals that he, like Hirayama, has agreed to let his daughter select her own marriage partner. After going for a short business trip outside Tokyo, Hirayama decides to visit the newly-weds at Hiroshima by train, where Taniguchi is stationed by his company.

==Production==
It is Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s first film in color, while Japan&#x27;s first color film, Keisuke Kinoshita&#x27;s &quot;Carmen Comes Home&quot;, had been released in 1951. Ozu chose Agfa film from Germany over Kodak or Fujifilm, as he felt that it conveyed red colors better. The meaning of &quot;equinox flower&quot; or &quot;higanbana&quot; of the title is the red &quot;Lycoris&quot;.

Shochiku requested that Ozu shoot &quot;Equinox Flower&quot; in color primarily to showcase Fujiko Yamamoto, the Daiei superstar it had borrowed for the film. The movie is constructed to spotlight the actress, who is elevated with extended dialogue scenes as a protégé of Hirayama who drives the plot resolution from the sidelines, and she won the 1958 Blue Ribbon Award as Best Actress for &quot;Equinox Flower&quot; and &quot;The Snowy Heron&quot;, which featured her in a much showier starring role. Yamamoto also receives what may be the only solo screen credit in any of Ozu&#x27;s films, which starred some of the biggest names in Japanese cinema.

==Release==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Equinox Flower&quot; garnered 88% approval on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.4/10. Dave Kehr praised the film as &quot;gentle, spare, and ultimately elusive, in a quietly satisfying way.&quot; &quot;Equinox Flower&quot; received four votes in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the world&#x27;s greatest films. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot; In &quot;Equinox Flower&quot;, a Japanese film by the old master Yasujiro Ozu, there is this sequence of shots: A room with a red teapot in the foreground. Another view of the room. The mother folding clothes. A shot down a corridor with a mother crossing it at an angle, and then a daughter crossing at the back. A reverse shot in the hallway as the arriving father is greeted by the mother and daughter. A shot as the father leaves the frame, then the mother, then the daughter. A shot as the mother and father enter the room, as in the background the daughter picks up the red pot and leaves the frame. This sequence of timed movement and cutting is as perfect as any music ever written, any dance, any poem.&quot;

===Home media===
In 2007, The Criterion Collection released the film as part of the DVD box set &quot;Eclipse Series 3: Late Ozu&quot;.

In 2011, the BFI released a Region 2 Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD). Included with this release is a standard definition presentation of &quot;There Was a Father&quot;.

<text>James Lawrence Pugh (December 12, 1820March 9, 1907) was an American politician and attorney who was a U.S. senator from Alabama from 1880 to 1897, as well as a member of the Confederate Congress during the American Civil War.

== Biography ==
Pugh was born in Burke County, Georgia, and moved to Alabama in 1824. He received a collegiate education, studied law under John Gill Shorter, and was admitted to the bar in 1841. He began to practise in Eufaula, Alabama. He was a presidential elector in 1848 and 1856. He represented Alabama&#x27;s second district as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives from December 5, 1859, until January 21, 1861, when he retired upon the secession of his state.

He then served as an officer in the Confederate States Army. He was subsequently elected to be the representative from Alabama&#x27;s 8th District to both the First Confederate Congress and the Second Confederate Congress, serving from February 22, 1862, until the surrender in 1865. Pugh served on the House Committee on Military Affairs throughout both Congresses, where he was a prominent critic of C.S. President Jefferson Davis.

Following the war, he returned to his law practice. Upon the restoration of his citizenship, Pugh was president of the Democratic state convention of 1874, a delegate to the 1875 state constitutional convention, and a presidential elector again in 1876. He was elected to fill the term left by the death of George S. Houston, and was reelected twice, serving in the Senate from November 24, 1880, to March 4, 1897. He lost renomination.

<text>Bitter Moon is a 1992 erotic romantic thriller film co-written and directed by Roman Polanski. It stars Peter Coyote, Emmanuelle Seigner, Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas. The film&#x27;s French title, &quot;&quot;, is a pun on the French phrase &quot;lune de miel&quot;, meaning &quot;honeymoon&quot;. It is based on the novel &quot;Lunes de fiel&quot; by French author Pascal Bruckner, published in English as &quot;Evil Angels&quot;. The score was composed by Vangelis.

==Plot==
British couple Nigel and Fiona Dobson are on a Mediterranean cruise ship to Istanbul en route to India. They encounter a beautiful young French woman, Mimi, and that night, Nigel chats briefly with her in the ship&#x27;s bar after seeing her dancing alone. Later, Nigel meets her much older and disabled American husband, Oscar Benton, who is a failed writer—acerbic, cynical and jaded.

Oscar invites Nigel to his cabin, where he tells Nigel in great detail how he and Mimi first met on a bus in Paris and fell passionately in love. Nigel relates all to Fiona. Both are appalled by Oscar&#x27;s exhibitionism, but Nigel is also fascinated by Mimi, who provokes him. Oscar later narrates how they explored bondage, sadomasochism and voyeurism. As a contrast to their sexual adventurousness, Nigel and Fiona meet a distinguished Indian gentleman, Mr Singh, who is travelling with his little daughter Amrita.

Invited by Mimi, Nigel, escaping from a bridge game, goes to meet her in her cabin, only to find that she and Oscar have played a prank on him. Nigel wants to leave, but another session unfolds, with Oscar describing how their love–hate relationship developed. Bored, he tried to break up, but Mimi begged him to let her live with him under any conditions. He complied, but started to explore sadistic fantasies at her expense, humiliating her in public. When Mimi became pregnant, he made her have an abortion, saying that he would be a terrible father. When he visited her in hospital, he was shocked by her condition and almost relented in his attempts to drive her away. He promised her a holiday in the Caribbean, but he got off the plane just before takeoff. Mimi departed alone, crying.

Leaving Oscar&#x27;s cabin, Nigel meets Mimi and they kiss. Afterwards, he finds Fiona in the bar flirting with a young man. She warns Nigel not to stray too far, and that anything he can do, she can do better. Nigel goes to Oscar, who continues his narration. After two years of parties and one-night stands, he drunkenly stepped in front of a vehicle by accident. To his surprise, Mimi came to visit him in the hospital where he was recovering from minor injuries and a fractured femur. Mimi shook hands with him, then pulled him out of his bed and left him hanging in his traction device, leaving him paraplegic. Oscar had no choice but to let Mimi move in with him again and take care of him. She revelled in dominating and humiliating him, seducing men in front of him. When Oscar was desperate and wanted to die, she gave him a gun as a birthday present. Having experienced highs and lows together, they realised they needed each other and actually got married.

Nigel clumsily tries to woo Mimi, encouraged and coached by Oscar. Things come to a head at the New Year&#x27;s Eve party, when Fiona catches them dancing together. Fiona tells him that Oscar had persuaded her to come to the party. She proceeds to dance seductively with Mimi, which culminates in a passionate kiss, cheered on by the other partygoers. A stormy sea interrupts the party and the two women leave together. Nigel goes outside clutching a bottle of liquor and screams his frustration into the wind and waves.

Nigel finds Fiona in Oscar&#x27;s cabin, sleeping naked beside Mimi. Oscar claims the women have had sex together. Nigel grabs his throat, but Oscar points a gun at him and he backs off. Oscar shoots the sleeping Mimi twice, then kills himself. While the bodies of Oscar and Mimi are being stretchered off the ship, Nigel and Fiona, shaken, embrace each other. Mr Singh encourages his little girl to comfort them.

==Score==
The film&#x27;s score by Vangelis was never officially released for sale, although bootlegs of the music taken directly from the film itself have since been produced.

==Reception==
On its release in Europe (in 1992) and North America (in 1994), &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews from critics. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; commented that &quot;Roman Polanski approaches rock bottom&quot; and called the film &quot;a phony slice of &quot;huis clos&quot; drama&quot; with &quot;a script that&#x27;s all over the map and a tone that veers from outre comedy to erotic game-playing.&quot; Janet Maslin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Whatever else Mr. Polanski may be – nasty, mocking, darkly subversive in his view of the world – he definitely isn&#x27;t dull. &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; is the kind of world-class, defiantly bad film that has a life of its own.&quot; A positive review came from Roger Ebert, who said &quot;Polanski directs it without compromise or apology, and it&#x27;s a funny thing how critics may condescend to it, but while they&#x27;re watching it you could hear a pin drop.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; commented that &quot;Polanski treats this slightly protracted tale of erotic obsession partly as deeply ironic black comedy&quot;, &quot;rich and darkly disturbing&quot; and &quot;also wickedly entertaining.&quot; Reviewing the film in 2009, Scott Tobias wrote: &quot;&quot;Bitter Moon&quot; is my favorite of the later-period Polanski films...nasty, potent, and psychologically knotty in a way that recalls the devil-may-care, &quot;enfant terrible&quot; Polanski of old.&quot; According to journalist Matthew Tempest, he and film director Christopher Nolan shared &quot;a soft spot&quot; for &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; as students.

<text>Luke Pryor (July 5, 1820August 5, 1900) was a U.S. senator from the state of Alabama. He was appointed to fill the Senate term left by the death of George S. Houston and served from January 7 to November 23, 1880, when a replacement was elected. Pryor was a Democrat. He is interred at City Cemetery in Athens, Alabama.

==Biography==

=== Birth and Parentage ===

He was born in 1820 in Alabama to parents Luke Pryor and Ann Batte Lane. His father&#x27;s first marriage was to Martha Scott, a sister of General Winfield Scott. His brother was the noted racehorse trainer John Benjamin Pryor of Natchez, Mississippi.

=== Life in Alabama ===

Pryor married Isabella Virginia Harris. They were the parents of 8 children, all born in Alabama. Luke Pryor lived at the Sugar Creek Plantation, in Athens, Alabama, for 40 years before his death. Pryor House , built in 1836, stands as a historic building in Limestone County, Alabama. Pryor studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1841. On the 1850 United States Census his occupation was recorded as &quot;lawyer.&quot;

Luke Pryor was an enslaver. On the 1840 Census, six free blacks under the age of 10 were recorded in his father&#x27;s household, as well as one enslaved male child under ten and an older female between 55 and 100. By 1850, Luke Pryor was recorded as enslaving 39 people between the ages of four months and 70 years; however, in 1860, only two enslaved people were recorded in his household. The American Civil War did not begin until April 12, 1861, and slavery was not completely abolished until 1865 after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.

<doc id="846362" wikidata="Q4829839" url="?curid=846362" title="Award numerals">
<text>An Arabic numeral device or numeral device sometimes called an &quot;award numeral&quot;, is a United States Armed Forces service device that may be authorized for wear on specific service ribbons and suspension ribbons of medals. Arabic numeral devices are bronze or gold in color and are inch in height.

Arabic numerals are worn to denote award of a second or subsequent award for which a member has already received the initial decoration or award. The ribbon denotes the first award and numerals starting with the numeral 2 denote the total number of awards. The inch numerals are similar to the inch Strike/Flight numerals worn by the United States Navy and Marine Corps.

U.S. military decorations and awards that may be authorized an Arabic Numeral device are as follows:
* Air Medal
* Armed Forces Reserve Medal (only in conjunction with the &quot;M&quot; device)
* NCO Professional Development Ribbon (numerals indicate the level of the course graduated, not multiple decorations)
* Army Overseas Service Ribbon
* Army Reserve Components Overseas Training Ribbon
* Navy Recruiting Service Ribbon
* Multinational Force and Observers Medal

With the exception of the Air Medal and Armed Forces Reserve Medal service ribbons and suspension ribbons, the United States Army is the only service branch to currently use numerals on other service ribbons, and the Navy on their Recruiting Service Ribbon. During World War II, some Naval Construction Battalions (Seabees) were issued the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with numerals instead of service stars.

<text>George Eliphaz Spencer (November 1, 1836 – February 19, 1893) was an American politician and a U.S. senator from the state of Alabama who also served as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born in Champion, New York, Spencer was the son of Gordon Percival and Deborah Mallory Spencer. He was educated at Montreal College in Canada. After relocating to Iowa he engaged in the study of law. During the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush he briefly relocated to Colorado where in November 1859 he founded the town of Breckenridge. 
He married English author Bella Zilfa in 1862.

==Career==
During the American Civil War, Spencer enlisted as a captain on October 16, 1862. While serving on the staff of Brig. Gen. Grenville M. Dodge, he requested a transfer to the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, a volunteer regiment made up of Southern Unionists, which did not have a permanent commander. Receiving a promotion to colonel, he led the regiment from September 11, 1863, until his resignation on July 5, 1865.

After the war, Spencer returned to Alabama to practice law. His wife died of typhoid fever in 1867. For a time he served as register in bankruptcy for the fourth district of Alabama.

Elected as a Republican to the United States Senate upon readmission of Alabama to the Union, Spencer served from July 13, 1868, to March 3, 1879. The Ku Klux Klan and their supporters accused him of corruption and rewarding supporters in the legislature with patronage positions, allegations which he denied.

He was appointed a commissioner of the Union Pacific Railroad with help from his previous leader, Major General Dodge. In 1877, he married prominent actress May Nunez, the niece and namesake of one-armed Confederate General William Wing Loring (May&#x27;s given names at birth were &quot;William Wing&quot;). The couple then spent two years on a ranch in Nevada tending to mining interests before settling in Washington, D.C., about 1880.

==Death==
Spencer died in Washington, D.C., on February 19, 1893 (age 56). He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia.

<text>George Wright (January 28, 1847 – August 21, 1937) was an American shortstop in professional baseball. He played for the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional team, when he was the game&#x27;s best player. He then played for the Boston Red Stockings, helping the team win six league championships from 1871 to 1878. His older brother Harry Wright managed both Red Stockings teams and made George his cornerstone. George was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937. After arriving in Boston, he also entered the sporting goods business. There he continued in the industry, assisting in the development of golf.

==Personal life==
Born in Yonkers, New York, 12 years younger than Harry, George Wright was raised as a cricket &quot;club pro&quot;, assisting their father Samuel Wright as Harry had done. Before George&#x27;s birth, Samuel Wright&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Cricket Club moved from Manhattan across the Hudson River to Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey, where many New York and New Jersey baseball clubs played in the 1850s. Both boys learned baseball, too, but George grew up with the &quot;national game&quot; and was barely in his teens when the American Civil War curtailed its boom; Harry was already 22 when the baseball fraternity convened for the first time, and 30 when the war ended. George&#x27;s younger brother Sam Wright also played baseball professionally, with brief appearances in the major leagues.

George was the father of tennis great Beals Wright, a U.S. Championship winner and Olympic gold medalist, and Irving Wright, U.S. Championship mixed doubles champion.

==Amateur baseball==
At some times during the war, both Wright brothers played for the venerable Gothams, the second-oldest baseball team after the Knickerbockers. According to Ivor-Campbell (1996), George moved from the Gotham juniors to the senior team when he was 15. At 17 in 1864, he was the regular catcher.

Baseball&#x27;s recovery from the American Civil War was far advanced in greater New York City (always untouched by the military conflict), as the leading clubs played more than 20 National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) matches, the Gothams 11. George played eight and led the team both in runs, scoring 2.4 times per game, and &quot;hands lost&quot;, put out only 2.4 times per game, average being three per player in a 9-inning game. In seven matches infielder Harry was fourth in scoring at 2.0 and second behind George in hands lost at 2.6 (Wright 2000: 91).

For the 1865 season, George was hired by the Philadelphia Cricket Club; that summer he played in five matches for the Olympic Ball Club of that city. The Olympic club was the devoted to games in the baseball genus, established in 1833. At the December annual meeting, the first in peacetime, NAABP membership tripled, including isolated clubs from as far as Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Wright returned to the Gothams for baseball; he was 19 and nearing his athletic peak. At the same time, Harry Wright moved to Cincinnati for a job at the Union Cricket Club.

Early in the summer of 1866, Wright moved from catcher for Gotham, which played eight NABBP matches that year, to shortstop for Union, which played 28, the leading number. The Union of Morrisania, now in the New York borough of the Bronx, were another charter member of the first Association, but one that moved toward professionalism in the postwar years, as the Gothams did not. In 1867, he joined the Nationals of Washington, D.C., the oldest club in that city, whose approach to professionalism was arranging government jobs, mainly with the Treasury. He played second base, shortstop, and pitcher in 29 of the 30 matches fully on record and in those matches led the team both in scoring and hands lost. Next year he returned to the Unions for the association&#x27;s last officially all-amateur season and moved permanently to the shortstop position. In 1868, Wright won the Clipper Medal for being the best shortstop in baseball.

==Cincinnati Red Stockings==

Meanwhile, George&#x27;s brother Harry had acquired baseball duties and had organized for Cincinnati the strongest team in the West, led in 1868 by a handful of players from the East — presumably compensated somehow by club members if not by the club. When the NABBP permitted professionalism for 1869, Harry augmented himself and four incumbents with five new men including his brother George, who was highest paid at $1400 for nine months. George remained a cornerstone of Harry&#x27;s teams for 10 seasons.

Cincinnati toured the continent undefeated in 1869, as George batted .633 with 49 home runs in 57 games. It may have been the strongest team in 1870, but the club dropped professional baseball after the second season.

==Major League Baseball==
Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates including George for 1871. The new Red Stockings team just missed winning the first National Association pennant. George suffered a broken leg and missed half the season; one more win would have been decisive in Boston&#x27;s favor. With some personnel changes, the Boston Red Stockings won the other four NA pennants, dominating so severely in 1875 that they helped provoke a new league. Wright holds the NA career record for the most triples (41), and he led the NA in triples with 15 in 1874.

On April 22, 1876, Wright became the first batter in National League history, and grounded out to the shortstop. Boston trailed badly in the first NL season after the defection of its Big Four western players to Chicago, but rebounded to win again both 1877 and 1878. George Wright had played an even decade for Harry&#x27;s teams. Another 1869 hire, Andy Leonard, was present for all but the 1871 second-place finish.

The Providence Grays, new in the NL for 1878, hired George to lead the team in 1879. He did as well as possible, wrestling the championship for himself from older brother Harry; for Providence and Rhode Island from older and regionally dominant Boston and Massachusetts. However, Wright &amp; Ditson Sporting Goods was growing, so George returned to Boston for business reasons. He remains the only man to win the pennant in his lone season as manager. Meanwhile, the National League introduced the reserve list system, and Providence listed George, so he was not free to sign with Boston. Until the 1879–80 off-season, every professional baseball player was a &quot;free agent&quot; for every season. During the next two seasons he played only a few games. When Boston changed managers for 1882, Harry signed to lead Providence and inherited the right to sign his brother. George played another season full-time, retiring after the 1882 season with a .301 batting average in the major leagues from 1871.

After Ditson died in 1891, Spalding purchased Wright &amp; Ditson Co in Feb 1892. The name Wright &amp; Ditson Co continued to be used several years after the purchase. 

==Cricket==
In 1882, Wright took up cricket seriously again with the Longwood Cricket Club of Boston where he dominated local cricket sides with Isaac Chambers, the Longwood cricket pro and greenskeeper, holding up the other bowling end. In 1891, Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke&#x27;s visiting English side. Wright&#x27;s side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourists in check. In 1892, Wright donated cricket gear to British Guianese (Guyana) cricket players, thereby starting a century-old tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.

==Golf==
In 1886, Wright obtained what was said to be the first set of golf clubs and balls in the United States and had them on display in the Wright &amp; Ditson sporting goods shop in Boston where a visitor from Scotland saw them and explained the game. In December 1890, Wright and three friends obtained a permit and chopped nine holes in the frozen ground of Boston&#x27;s Franklin Park, playing two rounds. (Six years later, a public golf course was laid out in Franklin Park. The course, now known as the William J. Devine Golf Course, is the second oldest public golf course in the United States.) 

Wright &amp; Ditson became a major seller of golf clubs; early U.S. Open champion Francis Ouimet worked at the store while pursuing his amateur career. Wright later donated the , the former Grew estate, for Boston&#x27;s second municipal course which became the Donald Ross-designed George Wright Golf Course located in the Hyde Park section of Boston.

==Baseball legacy==
George Wright served on the 1906–1907 Mills Commission that—despite a complete lack of historical evidence—determined that Cooperstown, New York was the birthplace of baseball. President Mills and secretary Sullivan probably did the work, with the others lending gravity and celebrity. (The commission&#x27;s determination has never been taken seriously by baseball historians and scholars.)

Wright accompanied the United States contingent to the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden where demonstrations of baseball, involving American track and field athletes and a team of Swedish players, were held. Wright umpired one of the games and provided instruction in the game for the Swedish players. Jim Thorpe, winner of the pentathlon and decathlon at that year&#x27;s Olympics and a future Major League Baseball player, was one of the American players participating in the baseball exhibitions.

Wright was consulted regarding the baseball centennial celebrations of 1939, including the establishment of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown. Soon after his own election to the Hall of Fame in 1937, he died in Boston of a stroke, aged 90. He is buried in Holyhood Cemetery, in Brookline, Massachusetts.

<doc id="846389" wikidata="Q1365446" url="?curid=846389" title="Joseph Bates (Adventist)">
<text>Joseph Bates (8 July 1792 – 19 March 1872) was an American seaman and revivalist minister. He was a co-founder and developer of Sabbatarian Adventism, whose followers would later establish the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Bates is also credited with convincing James White and Ellen G. White of the validity of the seventh-day Sabbath.

==Life and work==

Joseph Bates was born in Rochester, Massachusetts on July 8, 1792. His father, also named Joseph, was a volunteer in the Revolutionary War and his mother was the daughter of Barnabas Nye of Sandwich, Massachusetts. In 1793, Bates&#x27; family moved to the part of New Bedford, Massachusetts that would become the township of Fairhaven in 1812. In June 1807, Bates sailed as a cabin boy on the new ship commanded by Elias Terry, called the &quot;Fanny&quot;, to London via New York City. This was the commencement of Bates&#x27; sailing career.
In 1811, Bates was forced into servitude for the British navy and spent time as a prisoner during the War of 1812. After his release he continued his career, eventually becoming captain of a ship. During one of his voyages, he read a copy of the Bible that his wife packed for him. He experienced conversion and became involved in a variety of reforms, including helping to found an early temperance society. Bates became disturbed by the way the sailors (regardless of their religion) were forced to go to Anglican services; later in life he became adamant that the separation of church and state should be upheld. He also was a strong supporter of abolition. In his everyday life as a sailor, he noticed the intemperance of the sailors and the resulting side effects. Many of these problems came from poor rations, but many more were the result of overindulgence by the men. He became one of the champions of health reform; abstaining from all alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, even becoming a vegetarian. In 1839 he accepted the teachings of William Miller that Jesus was coming soon.

After October 22, 1844, like many other Millerites, Bates sought meaning out of the Great Disappointment. During the spring of 1845, Bates accepted the seventh-day Sabbath after reading a pamphlet by T. M. Preble. Bates soon became known as the &quot;apostle of the Sabbath&quot; and wrote several booklets on the topic. One of the first, published in 1846, was entitled &quot;The Seventh Day Sabbath, a Perpetual Sign&quot;. One of Bates&#x27; most significant contributions was his ability to connect theologically the Sabbath with a unique understanding of the heavenly sanctuary. This apocalyptic understanding of theology would become known as the Great Controversy theme.

Bates initially was skeptical of the young Ellen G. White and her prophetic gift, but became convinced of its truthfulness when he was in the presence of Ellen White when she had a vision of several planets. He contributed to early publications such as &quot;A Word to the &quot;Little Flock.&quot;&quot; Bates was active with the Whites in participating in a series of Bible Conferences held in 1848 to 1850 that has become known as the Sabbath and Sanctuary Conferences. During the 1850s Bates supported the development of a more formal church organization that culminated in 1863 with the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Ellen White rebuked the leaders of the Battle Creek church in 1866 for not having confidence in James White, and Bates is one of those who signed his name to a statement regarding this saying: &quot;&#x27;We now accept with deep sorrow of heart the reproof given us in this testimony,&#x27;&quot; &quot;Testimony for the Church No.13&quot;

His tendency to go to extremes was checked by cautions from Ellen White. &quot;I saw that the above named errors of Brother Bates (his position on helping the poor; praying for the sick before unbelievers) and others more dangerous brought confusion and had destroyed James&#x27;s confidence in Brother Bates;&quot; &quot;Manuscript 14, 1850&quot; But in the &quot;Advent Review&quot; of Dec. 11, 1879, Ellen White promotes Joseph Bates autobiography with these words: &quot;For young people, the Life of Joseph Bates is a treasure;...&quot;. He expressed his displeasure at Ellen White for rebuking him in his too extreme diet just one month before he died.

Joseph Bates died on March 19, 1872, in Battle Creek, Michigan. He is buried in Poplar Hill Cemetery in Monterey, Michigan.

Bates&#x27; family home at 191 Main St., Fairhaven, MA was purchased by Adventist Heritage and is being restored as a heritage attraction.

==Health reform==
Bates was the first temperance advocate and vegetarian Adventist. By 1844, Bates had given up all forms of alcohol, tea, coffee, meat, tobacco and &quot;greasy and rich foods.&quot; Later Seventh-day Adventists were influenced by Bates&#x27; health principles and by the 1860s Adventist publications discouraged the use of alcohol, coffee and tea.

==Bibliography==
The best primary resource is Joseph Bates, &quot;Autobiography&quot; (Battle Creek: Battle Creek Steam Press, 1868) and republished and annotated in 2004 by Andrews University Press. Other helpful treatments include Virgil E. Robinson, &quot;Cabin Boy to Advent Crusader&quot; (Southern Publishing Association, 1960), which was a popular treatment intended primarily for a youth audience; G. T. Anderson, &quot;Outrider of the Apocalypse: Life and Times of Joseph Bates&quot; (Review and Herald, 1972); and George R. Knight, &quot;Joseph Bates: The Real Founder of Seventh-day Adventism&quot; (Review and Herald, 2004).

Some of Bates&#x27; publications include:

<doc id="846391" wikidata="Q860583" url="?curid=846391" title="Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy">
<text>Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy (S&amp;D) is a spyware and adware removal computer program compatible with Microsoft Windows. Dating back to the first Adwares in 2000, Spybot scans the computer hard disk and/or RAM for malicious software.

Spybot-S&amp;D was written by the German software engineer Patrick Michael Kolla, and is distributed by Kolla&#x27;s Irish company Safer-Networking Limited. Development began in 2000 when Kolla, still a student, wrote a small program to deal with the &quot;Aureate/Radiate&quot; and &quot;Conducent TimeSink&quot; programs, two of the earliest examples of adware.

==Licensing==
Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy was formerly released as freeware for personal users (the former freeware edition is now a donationware), with more featureful versions available for purchase. Corporate and technician users have to buy a commercial version. The paid versions contain an anti-virus component that uses the BitDefender engine.

==Spybot features==
In addition to spyware and adware detection and disinfection, Spybot-S&amp;D can repair the registry, winsock LSPs, ActiveX objects, browser hijackers and BHOs, PUPs, HTTP cookies, trackerware, heavy duty, homepage hijackers, keyloggers, LSP, tracks, trojans, spybots, revision, and other kinds of malware. It can also delete tracking cookies. Spybot-S&amp;D has an Immunize function to block the installation of spyware before it occurs e.g. by modifying the hosts file. A secure file deleter is included. Spybot-S&amp;D was not originally intended to replace but complement anti-virus programs (prior to v. 2.1 ″Spybot +AV″), but it does detect some common trojans and rootkits. A free-standing rootkit finder, RootAlyzer, is available.

Some programs are supplied with attached spyware or adware and refuse to run when they are not present; newer versions of Spybot replace the spyware binaries with inert dummies (designed to fool programs which simply check for the presence of the spyware&#x27;s file).

In order to detect recently created programs efficiently, detection updates are released weekly with other improvements such as added languages and better heuristic algorithms. These updates are downloaded and installed from within the software from a variety of mirrors.

Spybot-S&amp;D is available for all versions of Windows starting with Windows 95. It is supplied translated into many languages and with several skins. Instructions are available on the website to enable users to design their own skins.

Technical support is currently supplied by means of Internet forums and support e-mails.

==Reviews and awards==
Versions of Spybot-S&amp;D won awards including the World Class 2003 Awards, the &quot;PC Magazine&quot; Editor&#x27;s Choice and &quot;PC User&quot; Top Buy #1. It has been recommended by ZDNet, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, MSNBC, CNN and other reviewers. Although &quot;PC Magazine&quot; initially rated it highly in 2003, their rating declined to &quot;poor&quot; in 2008 and &quot;dismal&quot; in 2012, improving to &quot;fair&quot; in 2014.

Newer versions of the program (ver. 2.2.25 and ver. 2.4), issued in 2014, received a 5/5 rating from &quot;TechRadar&quot;. In 2018 &quot;TechRadar&quot; considered Spybot among 4 of the best anti-malware software available.

==Versions==
Version 1.5 had better compatibility than previous versions with Wine (software which allows running of Windows programs under Linux), and restores compatibility with Windows 95 which was faulty in 1.4.

Version 1.6 was said by Safer Networking to scan several times faster than version 1.5.

Version 2.4 was released in July 2014.

==Conflicts with commercial anti-malware==
It was reported in 2009 that several commercial security products required users to uninstall the freely available Spybot S&amp;D when they are being installed or run, due to stated incompatibility with memory-resident &quot;immunizer&quot; TeaTimer (Spybot&#x27;s real-time protection application).

The makers of Spybot-S&amp;D came into conflict with Norton Internet Security over compatibility issues in 2006. Symantec recommended uninstalling Spybot-S&amp;D before installing Norton Internet Security. According to Safer Networking, no satisfactory explanation was provided to them for this decision. Antivirus professional Mary Landesman suggests a possible explanation may stem from a graphical glitch in TeaTimer module&#x27;s confirmation dialog. An official explanation from Safer Networking stated that the error was caused by a bug in the program used to build their code. The result of the bug was that users had difficulty enabling Norton Internet Security to make necessary changes to critical registry areas, such as allowing itself to launch on computer startup. Aside from this, Mary Landesman, like Safer Networking, concluded that the two programs had no issue with one another. The bug was fixed in the 1.5 release.

Kaspersky Anti-Virus and Kaspersky Internet Security since version 2009 force users to uninstall Spybot during the installation process, although there is no serious incompatibility yet known. The discussion was concluded in the Kaspersky forum, which said not to install Spybot at all. Kaspersky seems to be reluctant to fix the issue, despite receiving several complaints. Incompatibility between the products might occur when Spybot S&amp;D tries to modify the hosts-file (if selected by the user during immunization), which Kaspersky will interpret as an attempt to harmfully manipulate the file. This can be circumvented by not immunizing the hosts-file in Spybot S&amp;D.

Trend Micro Officescan followed Norton, Kaspersky and McAfee in simply removing Spybot without warning or notification afterwards.

===Internet Explorer 8===
The immunisation feature of Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy caused Internet Explorer 8 to start slower than expected. Fix KB969897, which resolved this problem while addressing certain other security vulnerabilities, was issued by Microsoft in 2009.

==Malicious lookalikes==
There are several malicious programs designed to look like this anti-malware software, with similar user interfaces and program file names. Some actually install spyware. These programs are known as rogue antispyware. One such program is &quot;SpywareBot&quot;. This program is a known rogue antispyware program, which fraudulently impersonates various anti-malware software including Spybot Search &amp; Destroy. However, this lookalike, unlike Spybot S&amp;D, requires payment.

<text>The genus Pritchardia (family Arecaceae) consists of between 24 and 40 species of fan palms (subfamily Coryphoideae) found on tropical Pacific Ocean islands in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuamotus, and most diversely in Hawaii. The generic name honors William Thomas Pritchard (1829–1907), a British consul at Fiji.

==Description==
These palms vary in height, ranging from . The leaves are fan-shaped (&quot;costapalmate&quot;) and the trunk columnar, naked, smooth or fibrous, longitudinally grooved, and obscurely ringed by leaf scars. The flowers and subsequent fruit are borne in a terminal cluster with simple or compound branches of an arcuate or pendulous inflorescence that (in some species) is longer than the leaves.

==Species==
There are 29 known species, of which 19 are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, with the remainder on other island groups. Many are critically endangered.
Oahu has the most named &quot;Pritchardia&quot; species of any of the Hawaiian islands, with nine named species on record in 1980. Eight of those species can be found in the rainy Koolau Range.

==Relationship with humans==
Native Hawaiians (who call them &quot;loulu&quot; or &quot;noulu&quot;) often plant the trees in their traditional homes. They often consume their seeds (known as &quot;hāwane&quot; or &quot;wāhane&quot;) raw, use their trunk wood as building material and leaves as roof thatching in houses and temples.

<doc id="846397" wikidata="Q305962" url="?curid=846397" title="Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad">
<text>Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad (, ; 28 June 1889 – 12 March 1964) was an Egyptian journalist, poet and literary critic, and member of the Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo. More precisely, because &quot;his writings cover a broad spectrum, including poetry, criticism, Islamology, history, philosophy, politics, biography, science, and Arabic literature&quot;, he is perceived to be a polymath.

==Biography==
Al-Aqqad was born in Aswan, a city in Upper Egypt, in 1889. His father was a money-changer originally from the Egyptian rural city of Damietta while his mother had Kurdish roots. He received little formal education, completing only his elementary education; he later supplemented his learning by buying books and reading on his own. Unlike his schoolmates, he spent all his weekly allowance on books. He read about religion, geography, history and many other subjects. He was known for his excellent English and French. He was also particularly well-read in German literature.

Al-&#x27;Aqqad was also an outspoken political thinker, and was jailed for a time between 1930 and 1931 for criticizing the country&#x27;s government. In 1942 when the forces of Adolf Hitler advanced on Egypt, al-&#x27;Aqqad fled to Sudan due to fear of reprisal for his criticism of Hitler. At the height of Hitler&#x27;s military advances, al-&#x27;Aqqad wrote his scathing work &quot;Hitler in the Balance&quot; in June 1940 in which he lambasts Nazism as the greatest threat to freedom, modernity and the very existence of man. In addition to his general opposition to both fascism and communism, al-&#x27;Aqqad was also both a member of the Egyptian parliament for a time as a member of the Wafd Party, and later a member of the Chamber of Deputies.

He wrote more than a hundred of books about philosophy, religion, and poetry, along with a philosophical study of the Qur&#x27;an and various biographies of historic Muslim leaders. He founded a poetry school with Ibrahim Al-Mazny and Abdel Rahman Shokry called Al-Diwan.

== Romantic relationships ==

Al-Aqqad experienced two major romantic relationships in his life. The first was whom he called &quot;Sarah&quot; in his novel of the same name. The second was with the famous Egyptian actress Madiha Yousri. This relationship was ended by al-Aqqad himself, because of Yousri&#x27;s career as an actress. Al-Aqqad wrote a poetry work about this relationship called &quot;Cyclones of a Sunset&quot; (&quot;A-Asiru Maghrib&quot; in Arabic).

It was reported by prolific Egyptian author Anis Mansour and various other attendees of Al-Aqqad&#x27;s famous &#x27;lounge&#x27; that he kept a painting in his bedroom that displayed a beautiful cake with cockroaches crawling over it. Supposedly, Al-Aqqad kept this in his room as &#x27;the first thing he looked at in the morning and the last thing he saw in the evening&#x27;. It symbolized beauty and purity (the cake) that is wasted to the glamor of spotlights (the cockroaches) as was the case (as he perceived) with actress Madiha Yousri.

== Death ==

Al-Aqqad died on the morning of 13 March 1964. His body was transported to his hometown, Aswan, for burial on the same day.

In the early 1980s, an Egyptian television series was produced about the life of al-Aqqad, which was titled &quot;The Giant&quot; (&quot;Al Imlaq&quot; in Arabic). It starred Egyptian actor Mahmud Mursi.

There is a street in the Nasr City district of Cairo named after al-Aqqad.

==Works==
Abbās al-Aqqād was &quot;a prolific writer, he authored over a hundred books and several thousand articles&quot;, and he is most famous for his Abqarīyat series which consists of seven books cover the life of seven of the most important Sahabah like Abu Bakr and Ali. His works include:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* &quot;The genius of Christ&quot; (2001) translated F. Peter Ford, .

<text>The Yablonoi Mountains or Yablonovy Mountains (, , ; , &quot;Yablony nuruu&quot;) are a mountain range, in Transbaikal (mainly in Zabaykalsky Krai), Siberia, Russia. The range is sparsely inhabited with most settlements engaged in mining. The area is especially rich in tin. The city of Chita lies between the Yablonoi Mountains to the west and the Chersky Range to the east.

The Trans-Siberian Railroad passes the mountains at Chita and runs parallel to the range before going through a tunnel to bypass the heights.

==Geography==
The Yablonoi Mountains stretch for about in a northeast–southwest direction. They rise mostly in the western part of the Zabaikalsky Krai, with a small section in the southeastern part of Buryatia. The width of the range varies between and . The Vitim Plateau lies to the north and the Borshchovochny Range to the east of the range. The tallest peak is Kontalaksky Golets, a &quot;golets&quot;-type of mountain with a bald peak, at above sea level.

The Vitim River flows at the northwestern edge of the range, together with its tributaries the Konda and the Karenga, which flow northeastwards. To the southwest flow the Khilok and the Ingoda and in the northeast the Olyokma.

==Flora==
The slopes of the Yablonoviy Range are covered with larch and occasional fir and silver fir taiga. Pine forests are quite common on the southern slopes of the range. Peaks higher than 1,200–1,400 metres are covered with mountain tundra with bare summits (golets) at higher altitudes.

<text>Ergoloid mesylates (USAN), co-dergocrine mesilate (BAN) or dihydroergotoxine mesylate, trade name Hydergine, is a mixture of the methanesulfonate salts of three dihydrogenated ergot alkaloids (dihydroergocristine, dihydroergocornine, and alpha- and beta-dihydroergocryptine).

It was developed by Albert Hofmann (the discoverer of LSD) for Sandoz (now part of Novartis).

==Medical uses==
It has been used to treat dementia and age-related cognitive impairment (such as in Alzheimer disease), as well as to aid in recovery after stroke.

A systematic review published in 1994 found little evidence to support the use of ergoloid mesylates, concluding only that potentially effective doses may be higher than those currently approved in dementia treatment.

Ergoloid Mesylate Tablets USP for sublingual use contain 1 mg of Ergoloid Mesylates USP, a mixture of the methanesulfonate salt of the following hydrogenated alkaloids: Dihydroergocornine mesylate 0.333 mg, Dihydroergocristine mesylate 0.333 mg, Dihydroergocryptine mesylate 0.333 mg.

It has been used to treat hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels).

The use of ergoloid alkaloids for dementia has been surrounded with uncertainties. In 2000, a systematic Cochrane review concluded that hydergine was well tolerated and showed significant treatment effects when assessed by either global ratings or comprehensive rating scales. The small number of available trials for analysis, however, limited the ability to demonstrate statistically significant moderating effects in certain subgroups (e.g. younger age, higher dosage, Alzheimer disease).

==Contraindications==
Ergoloid is contraindicated in individuals who have previously shown hypersensitivity to the drug. They are also contraindicated in patients who have psychosis, acute or chronic, regardless of etiology. Specific drug interactions are unknown but it has been claimed that there are multiple potential interactions.

==Side effects==
Adverse effects are minimal. The most common include transient, dose dependent nausea and gastrointestinal disturbances, and sublingual irritation with SL tablets. Other common side effects include:

* Cardiovascular: orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia
* Dermatologic: skin rash, flushing
* Ocular: blurred vision
* Respiratory: nasal congestion
* Possible risk of fibrosis and ergotism 

As a result of the last-mentioned effects, the use of ergoline derivatives for the treatment of blood circulation disorders, memory problems, sensation problems and the treatment of migraine is no longer permitted in some EU countries because the risks are believed to outweigh any benefits. However, this concern may be unnecessarily suppressing the use of ergoline medications.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Despite the fact that this drug has been used in the treatment of dementia for many years, its mechanism of action is still not clear. It stimulates dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors and blocks alpha-adrenoreceptors. Current studies imply that the major effect of hydergine may be the modulation of synaptic neurotransmission rather than solely increasing blood flow as was once thought. A prominent feature that accompanies aging is an increase in monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels. This results in decreased availability of catecholamines in the synaptic cleft. In one study, an interaction between age and hydergine treatment was observed in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. The hydergine effect was more pronounced in the aged group in the hypothalamus and cerebellum, and more pronounced in the adult in the hippocampus. These findings imply that increased brain MAO activity in aging can be modified by hydergine treatment in some brain regions.

==Chemistry==
The four constituents differ only in which of four proteinogenic amino acids is used in biosynthesis:

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Brand names include Hydergine, Hydergina, Gerimal, Niloric, Redizork, Alkergot, Cicanol, Redergin, and Hydrine.

<text>Eberhard III (c. 885 – 2 October 939), a member of the Conradine dynasty, was Duke of Franconia, succeeding his elder brother, King Conrad I, in December 918. From 926 to 928, he also acted as ruler of Lotharingia.

==Life==
Eberhard was the second son of Conrad the Elder and his wife Glismut (d. 924), probably an illegitimate daughter of the Carolingian emperor Arnulf of Carinthia. The Conradines, counts in the Franconian Lahngau region, had been loyal supporters of the Carolingians. At the same time, they competed vigorously for predominance in Franconia with the sons of the Babenbergian duke Henry of Franconia at Bamberg Castle. In 906 the two parties battled each other near Fritzlar. Conrad the Elder was killed, as were two of the three Babenberg brothers. The Babenberg feud ended, when King Louis the Child took the Conradines&#x27; side and Conrad the Younger became the undisputed duke of all Franconia.

Upon the early death of King Louis in 911, the Saxon, Swabian and Bavarian princes elected Conrad the Younger King of East Francia. Under the rule of his brother, Eberhard from 913 appeared as count in the Franconian Hessengau and Persgau, 913 and 928 als as count in the Upper Lahngau. He supported his brother against the rivalling dukes Arnulf of Bavaria and Henry of Saxony (Henry the Fowler). In 914 he assumed the office of a Franconian margrave; nevertheless, unable to assert his claims, he had to witness Henry&#x27;s conquest of the Thuringian lands of late Duke Burchard.

On his deathbed in Forchheim, in December 918, King Conrad assembled the German princes to arrange his succession. According to the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey, he persuaded Eberhard to forgo any ambition for the German crown and to urge the Prince-electors of the Empire to choose his former rival, the Ottonian duke Henry the Fowler, as his successor. Eberhard was assigned to personally hand over the royal insignia to Henry at the Imperial Diet, which was held in May 919 in Fritzlar. Conrad considered this to be the only way to end the long-standing feud between Saxons and Franks and to prevent the dissolution of the Empire into smaller states based on the German stem duchies.

Eberhard succeeded his brother as Duke of Franconia and remained a loyal supporter of the new king Henry I. After Henry had reconquered the troubled and restless Duchy of Lotharingia, he also conferred to him the office of a regent in 926. Eberhard quickly stabilized the Lotharingian lands and ruled until in 928 King Henry enfeoffed his son-in-law Gilbert, the husband of his daughter Gerberga.

After Henry&#x27;s death, however, Eberhard soon came into conflict with the king&#x27;s son and successor Otto I, who aimed at strengthening the royal authority. In 937 the Franconian duke invested Helmern castle near Peckelsheim, located near the Saxon border and garrisoned by a Saxon burgrave who refused to swear fealty to any non-Saxon. King Otto called the feuding parties to a royal court at Magdeburg, where Eberhard was ordered to pay a fine and his lieutenants were sentenced to carry dead dogs in public, a particularly dishonouring punishment. Infuriated, Eberhard joined Otto&#x27;s opponents, raising a rebellion in 938 with Otto&#x27;s half-brother Thankmar and the new Duke Eberhard of Bavaria, the late Duke Arnulf&#x27;s son. The revolt was soon suppressed; Thankmar was assassinated at Eresburg Castle, and Eberhard of Bavaria was replaced by his uncle Berthold as duke (ruled 938–945).

Following a brief reconciliation with King Otto, Eberhard then allied himself with Duke Gilbert of Lorraine, Archbishop Frederick of Mainz, and Henry, Otto&#x27;s younger brother, in a new uprising. Their united forces posed a serious threat to Otto&#x27;s rule; nevertheless, on 2 October 939, the rebels were finally defeated in the Battle of Andernach. Eberhard of Franconia was killed, allegedly by his Conradine relative Count Odo of Wetterau, whereafter his duchy was seized and remained a direct Imperial possession until its dissolution in 1039.

<doc id="846412" wikidata="Q3711784" url="?curid=846412" title="Conjugate prior">
<text>In Bayesian probability theory, if, given a likelihood function 
formula_1, the posterior distribution formula_2 is in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution formula_3, the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions with respect to that likelihood function and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function formula_1. 

A conjugate prior is an algebraic convenience, giving a closed-form expression for the posterior; otherwise, numerical integration may be necessary. Further, conjugate priors may give intuition by more transparently showing how a likelihood function updates a prior distribution.

The concept, as well as the term &quot;conjugate prior&quot;, were introduced by Howard Raiffa and Robert Schlaifer in their work on Bayesian decision theory. A similar concept had been discovered independently by George Alfred Barnard.

== Example ==
The form of the conjugate prior can generally be determined by inspection of the probability density or probability mass function of a distribution. For example, consider a random variable which consists of the number of successes formula_5 in formula_6 Bernoulli trials with &quot;unknown&quot; probability of success formula_7 in [0,1]. This random variable will follow the binomial distribution, with a probability mass function of the form
:formula_8

The usual conjugate prior is the beta distribution with parameters (formula_9, formula_10):
:formula_11
where formula_9 and formula_10 are chosen to reflect any existing belief or information (formula_14 and formula_15 would give a uniform distribution) and formula_16 is the Beta function acting as a normalising constant.

In this context, formula_9 and formula_10 are called &quot;hyperparameters&quot; (parameters of the prior), to distinguish them from parameters of the underlying model (here formula_7). A typical characteristic of conjugate priors is that the dimensionality of the hyperparameters is one greater than that of the parameters of the original distribution. If all parameters are scalar values, then there will be one more hyperparameter than parameter; but this also applies to vector-valued and matrix-valued parameters. (See the general article on the exponential family, and also consider the Wishart distribution, conjugate prior of the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution, for an example where a large dimensionality is involved.)

If we sample this random variable and get formula_5 successes and formula_21 failures, then we have

:formula_22

This is the Poisson distribution that is &quot;the&quot; most likely to have generated the observed data formula_23. But the data could also have come from another Poisson distribution, e.g., one with formula_24, or formula_25, etc. In fact, there is an infinite number of Poisson distributions that &quot;could&quot; have generated the observed data. With relatively few data points, we should be quite uncertain about which exact Poisson distribution generated this data. Intuitively we should instead take a weighted average of the probability of formula_26 for each of those Poisson distributions, weighted by how likely they each are, given the data we&#x27;ve observed formula_23.

Generally, this quantity is known as the posterior predictive distribution formula_28 where formula_29 is a new data point, formula_23 is the observed data and formula_31 are the parameters of the model. Using Bayes&#x27; theorem we can expand formula_32 therefore formula_33 Generally, this integral is hard to compute. However, if you choose a conjugate prior distribution formula_3, a closed-form expression can be derived. This is the posterior predictive column in the tables below.

Returning to our example, if we pick the Gamma distribution as our prior distribution over the rate of the Poisson distributions, then the posterior predictive is the negative binomial distribution, as can be seen from the table below. The Gamma distribution is parameterized by two hyperparameters formula_35, which we have to choose. By looking at plots of the gamma distribution, we pick formula_36, which seems to be a reasonable prior for the average number of cars. The choice of prior hyperparameters is inherently subjective and based on prior knowledge.

Given the prior hyperparameters formula_9 and formula_10 we can compute the posterior hyperparameters formula_39 and formula_40

Given the posterior hyperparameters, we can finally compute the posterior predictive of formula_41

This much more conservative estimate reflects the uncertainty in the model parameters, which the posterior predictive takes into account.

<text>Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1949 followed the rules in place since 1947, which had governed two successful elections of recent players. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from players retired less than 25 years, with provision for a runoff in case of no winner. This year the runoff was necessary to elect one person, Charlie Gehringer. Meanwhile, the Old-Timers Committee, which met on no schedule and not since 1946, responded again to the continuing calls for election of more of the game&#x27;s earlier stars. It selected Mordecai Brown and Kid Nichols.

An induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on June 13, 1949, for inductees of both 1948 and 1949. Of the five total inductees, Kid Nichols and Pie Traynor attended, while Charlie Gehringer was unable to attend. Mordecai Brown and Herb Pennock had both died in 1948. Dignitaries present included National League president Ford Frick, Hall of Fame founder Stephen Carlton Clark, Hall of Fame president Bob Quinn, and Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey.

==BBWAA election==

===Initial ballot===
The 10-year members of the BBWAA had the authority to select any players active in 1924 or later, provided they had not been active in 1948. Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. If no candidate received votes on 75% of the ballots, the top 20 candidates would advance to a runoff election.

A total of 153 ballots were cast, with 1,409 individual votes for 98 specific candidates, an average of 9.21 per ballot; 115 votes were required for election. The results were announced in February 1949. For the first time in three elections following the most recent format change, no candidate received 75% of the vote, and a runoff was necessary.

As had been true the previous year, a large number of players received votes, though few players were named who had not appeared in the 1948 vote apart from the newly eligible 1947 retirees (prominently, Mel Ott and Hank Greenberg); every still-eligible player who received more than 2 votes in 1948 was again named. 66 of those named received votes on less than 5% of the ballots, with 28 receiving only a single vote; every candidate had been eligible at some point in the past – for some, the 1936 election in which active players were eligible.
Greenberg&#x27;s eligibility was questioned by some voters, as he had been listed on the Cleveland Indians&#x27; active roster for part of the 1948 season as a precautionary move against injuries to other players. However, he was removed from the active roster once it became clear that his position as an Indians executive precluded any playing role, and he did not appear in any games; nonetheless, some voters maintained that his inclusion on the roster made him an active player and thus ineligible for election in 1949.

Once again, the focus was now on the most recent players; those who had retired before 1932 receded even further in the voting. Only 2 of the top 22 candidates, and none of the top 15, had retired before 1932; 12 of the 20 players reaching the runoff had been active in 1941 or later. Of the 98 players named, only 24 retired before 1930; they received only 9% of the vote. Three players who had retired before 1924 (none earlier than 1921) and were officially ineligible nevertheless received a single vote each; this was a notable reduction from the previous year&#x27;s total of 23 votes for such now-ineligible candidates. Votes for those best known as managers again appeared, though only for those who were eligible as players and not to the same extent as in 1948, perhaps due to an expectation of more selections from the Old-Timers Committee.

Chief Bender, who was technically eligible due to a single inning pitched in 1925, received only 2 votes – a continued drop from his past prominence on the ballot; as with the previous election, it seems either that most voters were unaware of his eligibility or that they viewed it as irrelevant to the spirit of the rules. There was also some confusion as to the cutoff year for eligibility; some writers believed it to be 1927 or 1928 rather than 1924. Dizzy Dean, whose eligibility in 1948 had been questioned due to a single appearance in a 1947 game, returned to the same level he had attained in the 1947 election. Unlike the 1948 election, no players active in the previous year received votes.

The top 20 candidates, who had each received 20 or more votes, advanced to the runoff election; candidates who have since been 
selected in subsequent elections are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;:


===Runoff election===
From the 20 final candidates listed on the ballot, voters were instructed to cast votes for five; they were aware of the totals from the first election. Any candidates receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be elected and honored with induction to the Hall. A total of 187 ballots were cast, with 920 individual votes for the 20 candidates, an average of 4.92 per ballot; 141 votes were required for election. The results were announced on May 5; exactly one player reached the threshold of 75% and was therefore elected.

The more recent players once again figured more prominently in the voting, with the top 6 candidates retired less than 7 years. There was much criticism from those who disliked the runoff process, believing it amounted to two virtually identical elections in a row; with the candidates finishing in roughly the same order both times, many voters felt they were essentially being encouraged to vote for the top candidates from the first ballot in order to ensure at least one selection (in fact, vote totals decreased for every candidate save Gehringer and Ott, the top two vote-getters in the initial round). As a result, the rules were again revised by the Hall of Fame Committee, and the runoff procedure was eliminated after 1949; it would not be reinstated until after the 1960 election.

The induction ceremonies were held in Cooperstown on June 13, with Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey officiating. The two 1948 selectees being formally inducted as well; Pie Traynor was present. Charlie Gehringer, however, was unable to attend, as he was in California preparing for his wedding on June 18.

The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; all the remaining candidates have since been selected in subsequent elections, with 16 of the 20 chosen by 1956, and the last (Tony Lazzeri) in 1991:

==Old-Timers Committee==
After not having voted on new inductees since 1946, the committee still did not meet formally to consider candidates; instead, the members cast ballots by mail on candidates from the pre-1924 era. This minor action temporarily decreased criticism that earlier players were being overlooked, but it would be the only attempt between 1946 and 1953 to elect players from this period, and there was no attempt to review managers and other non-playing candidates.

On May 9, it was announced that two pitchers had been selected:

*Mordecai &quot;Three Finger&quot; Brown, whose career extended from 1903 to 1916, ending with 239 victories and a 2.06 ERA; he had been the main pitching star on the Chicago Cubs teams which dominated the National League between 1906 and 1910, with Brown winning 20 or more games each season as the club won four pennants. His shutout in Game 5 of the 1907 World Series clinched the championship for the Cubs. In 25 career matchups against Christy Mathewson, Brown won 13 times, with Mathewson winning 11. His partial loss of two fingers in a childhood farm accident had led to his pitches having an atypical motion.
*Charles &quot;Kid&quot; Nichols, who won 360 games between 1890 and 1906, primarily with the 5-time champion Boston Beaneaters; at age 30, he became the youngest man ever to win 300 games, and he retired with the 3rd-most wins of any pitcher. He won over 20 games every year in the 1890s, and won 30 or more a record 7 times. An incredibly strong-armed pitcher despite his small size (5&#x27;9&quot;, 170 pounds (77 kg)), he regularly pitched over 400 innings per year, and completed all but 30 of his 561 career starts – never being replaced by a relief pitcher.

Nichols was still living, but Brown had died the previous year. They were formally inducted on June 13 along with Charlie Gehringer and the 1948 selections, Pie Traynor and the late Herb Pennock; Nichols and Traynor were in attendance.

The selection of these two pitchers from the period between 1890 and 1916 was roundly applauded, but it was noted that stars of the earlier era had been ignored once again, as well as position players from the same period.

<text>Psychrometrics (or psychrometry, ; also called hygrometry) is the field of engineering concerned with the physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapor mixtures.

== History ==
With the inventions of the hygrometer and thermometer, the theories of combining the two began to emerge during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In 1818, a German inventor, Ernst Ferdinand August (1795-1870), patented the term “psychrometer”, from the Greek language meaning “cold measure”. The psychrometer is a hygrometric instrument based on the principle that dry air enhances evaporation, unlike wet air, which slows it. 

==Common applications==

Although the principles of psychrometry apply to any physical system consisting of gas-vapor mixtures, the most common system of interest is the mixture of water vapor and air, because of its application in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and meteorology. In human terms, our thermal comfort is in large part a consequence of not just the temperature of the surrounding air, but (because we cool ourselves via perspiration) the extent to which that air is saturated with water vapor.

Many substances are hygroscopic, meaning they attract water, usually in proportion to the relative humidity or above a critical relative humidity. Such substances include cotton, paper, cellulose, other wood products, sugar, calcium oxide (burned lime) and many chemicals and fertilizers. Industries that use these materials are concerned with relative humidity control in production and storage of such materials. Relative humidity is often controlled in manufacturing areas where flammable materials are handled, to avoid fires caused by the static electricity discharges that can occur in very dry air.

In industrial drying applications, such as drying paper, manufacturers usually try to achieve an optimum between low relative humidity, which increases the drying rate, and energy usage, which decreases as exhaust relative humidity increases. In many industrial applications it is important to avoid condensation that would ruin product or cause corrosion.

Molds and fungi can be controlled by keeping relative humidity low. Wood destroying fungi generally do not grow at relative humidities below 75%.

==Psychrometric properties==

===Dry-bulb temperature (DBT)===

The dry-bulb temperature is the temperature indicated by a thermometer exposed to the air in a place sheltered from direct solar radiation. The term dry-bulb is customarily added to temperature to distinguish it from wet-bulb and dew point temperature. In meteorology and psychrometrics the word temperature by itself without a prefix usually means dry-bulb temperature. Technically, the temperature registered by the dry-bulb thermometer of a psychrometer. The name implies that the sensing bulb or element is in fact dry. WMO provides a 23-page chapter on the measurement of temperature.

===Wet-bulb temperature (WBT)===

The thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature is a thermodynamic property of a mixture of air and water vapor. The value indicated by a wet-bulb thermometer often provides an adequate approximation of the thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature.

The accuracy of a simple wet-bulb thermometer depends on how fast air passes over the bulb and how well the thermometer is shielded from the radiant temperature of its surroundings. Speeds up to 5,000 ft/min (~60 mph, 25.4 m/s) are best but it may be dangerous to move a thermometer at that speed. Errors up to 15% can occur if the air movement is too slow or if there is too much radiant heat present (from sunlight, for example).

A wet bulb temperature taken with air moving at about 1–2 m/s is referred to as a screen temperature, whereas a temperature taken with air moving about 3.5 m/s or more is referred to as sling temperature.

A psychrometer is a device that includes both a dry-bulb and a wet-bulb thermometer. A sling psychrometer requires manual operation to create the airflow over the bulbs, but a powered psychrometer includes a fan for this function. Knowing both the dry-bulb temperature (DBT) and wet-bulb temperature (WBT), one can determine the relative humidity (RH) from the psychrometric chart appropriate to the air pressure.

===Dew point temperature===

The saturation temperature of the moisture present in the sample of air, it can also be defined as the temperature at which the vapour changes into liquid (condensation). Usually the level at which water vapor changes into liquid marks the base of the cloud in the atmosphere hence called condensation level. So the temperature value that allows this process (condensation) to take place is called the &#x27;dew point temperature&#x27;. A simplified definition is the temperature at which the water vapour turns into &quot;dew&quot; (Chamunoda Zambuko 2012).

===Humidity===
====Specific humidity====
Specific humidity is defined as the mass of water vapor as a proportion of the mass of the moist air sample (including both dry air and the water vapor); it is closely related to humidity ratio and always lower in value.

====Absolute humidity====
The mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air containing the water vapor. This quantity is also known as the water vapor density.

==== Relative humidity ====
Is a ratio, expressed in percent, of the amount of atmospheric moisture present relative to the amount that would be present if the air was saturated.

===Specific enthalpy===
Analogous to the specific enthalpy of a pure substance. In psychrometrics, the term quantifies the total energy of both the dry air and water vapour per kilogram of dry air.

===Specific volume===
Analogous to the specific volume of a pure substance. However, in psychrometrics, the term quantifies the total volume of both the dry air and water vapour per unit mass of dry air.

===Psychrometric ratio===
The psychrometric ratio is the ratio of the heat transfer coefficient to the product of mass transfer coefficient and humid heat at a wetted surface. It may be evaluated with the following equation:
: formula_1

: where:
:: formula_2 = psychrometric ratio, dimensionless
:: formula_3 = convective heat transfer coefficient, W m−2 K−1
:: formula_4 = convective mass transfer coefficient, kg m−2 s−1
:: formula_5 = humid heat, J kg−1 K−1

The psychrometric ratio is an important property in the area of psychrometry, as it relates the absolute humidity and saturation humidity to the difference between the dry bulb temperature and the adiabatic saturation temperature.

Mixtures of air and water vapor are the most common systems encountered in psychrometry. The psychrometric ratio of air-water vapor mixtures is approximately unity, which implies that the difference between the adiabatic saturation temperature and wet bulb temperature of air-water vapor mixtures is small. This property of air-water vapor systems simplifies drying and cooling calculations often performed using psychrometric relationships.

===Humid heat===
Humid heat is the constant-pressure specific heat of moist air, per unit mass of the dry air.
The humid heat is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of unit mass of a water vapor - air mixture by 1 °C.

===Pressure===
Many psychrometric properties are dependent on pressure concept: 
* vapor pressure of water;
* atmospheric pressure at the location of the sample.

==Psychrometric charts==

===Terminology===
A psychrometric chart is a graph of the thermodynamic parameters of moist air at a constant pressure, often equated to an elevation relative to sea level. The ASHRAE-style psychrometric chart, shown here, was pioneered by Willis Carrier in 1904. It depicts these parameters and is thus a graphical equation of state. The parameters are:

* Dry-bulb temperature (&quot;DBT&quot;) is that of an air sample, as determined by an ordinary thermometer. It is typically plotted as the abscissa (horizontal axis) of the graph. The SI units for temperature are kelvins or degrees Celsius; other units are degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Rankine.
* Wet-bulb temperature (&quot;WBT&quot;) is that of an air sample after it has passed through a constant-pressure, ideal, adiabatic saturation process, that is, after the air has passed over a large surface of liquid water in an insulated channel. In practice this is the reading of a thermometer whose sensing bulb is covered with a wet sock evaporating into a rapid stream of the sample air (see Hygrometer). When the air sample is pre-saturated with water, the WBT will read the same as the DBT. The slope of lines of constant WBT is the ratio between the heat of vaporization of water and the specific heat of dry air, roughly 0.4.
* Dew point temperature (&quot;DPT&quot;) is the temperature at which a moist air sample at the same pressure would reach water vapor &quot;saturation.&quot; At this point further removal of heat would result in water vapor condensing into liquid water fog or, if below freezing point, solid hoarfrost. The dew point temperature is measured easily and provides useful information, but is normally not considered an independent property of the air sample as it duplicates information available via other humidity properties and the saturation curve.
* Relative humidity (&quot;RH&quot;) is the ratio of the mole fraction of water vapor to the mole fraction of saturated moist air at the same temperature and pressure. RH is dimensionless, and is usually expressed as a percentage. Lines of constant RH reflect the physics of air and water: they are determined via experimental measurement. The concept that air &quot;holds&quot; moisture, or that moisture &quot;dissolves&quot; in dry air and saturates the solution at some proportion, is erroneous (albeit widespread); see relative humidity for further details.
* Humidity ratio is the proportion of mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air at the given conditions (DBT, WBT, DPT, RH, etc.). It is also known as the moisture content or mixing ratio. It is typically plotted as the ordinate (vertical axis) of the graph. For a given DBT there will be a particular humidity ratio for which the air sample is at 100% relative humidity: the relationship reflects the physics of water and air and must be determined by measurement. The dimensionless humidity ratio is typically expressed as grams of water per kilogram of dry air, or grains of water per pound of air (7000 grains equal 1 pound).
* Specific enthalpy, symbolized by &quot;h&quot;, is the sum of the internal (heat) energy of the moist air in question, including the heat of the air and water vapor within. Also called heat content per unit mass. In the approximation of ideal gases, lines of constant enthalpy are parallel to lines of constant WBT. Enthalpy is given in (SI) joules per kilogram of air, or BTU per pound of dry air.
* Specific volume is the volume of the mixture (dry air plus the water vapor) containing one unit of mass of &quot;dry air&quot;. The SI units are cubic meters per kilogram of dry air; other units are cubic feet per pound of dry air. The inverse of specific volume is usually confused as the density of the mixture. However, to obtain the actual mixture density (formula_6) one must multiply the inverse of the specific volume by unity plus the humidity ratio value at the point of interest:

: formula_7

: where:
:: formula_8 = mass of dry air
:: formula_9 = mass of water vapor
:: formula_10 = total volume
:: formula_11 = moist air specific volume, m3 kg−1
:: formula_12 = humidity ratio

The psychrometric chart allows all the parameters of some moist air to be determined from any three independent parameters, one of which must be the pressure. Changes in &quot;state&quot;, such as when two air streams mix, can be modeled easily and somewhat graphically using the correct psychrometric chart for the location&#x27;s air pressure or elevation relative to sea level. For locations at not more than 2000 ft (600 m) of altitude it is common practice to use the sea-level psychrometric chart.

In the &quot;ω&quot;-&quot;t&quot; chart, the dry bulb temperature (&quot;t&quot;) appears as the abscissa (horizontal axis) and the humidity ratio (&quot;ω&quot;) appear as the ordinate (vertical axis). A chart is valid for a given air pressure (or elevation above sea level). From any two independent ones of the six parameters dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity ratio, specific enthalpy, and specific volume, all the others can be determined. There are formula_13 possible combinations of independent and derived parameters.

===Locating parameters on chart===
* Dry-bulb temperature: These lines are drawn straight, not always parallel to each other, and slightly inclined from the vertical position. This is the &quot;t&quot;–axis, the abscissa (horizontal) axis. Each line represents a constant temperature.

* Dew point temperature: From the state point follow the horizontal line of constant humidity ratio to the intercept of 100% RH, also known as the &quot;saturation curve&quot;. The dew point temperature is equal to the fully saturated dry bulb or wet bulb temperatures.

* Wet-bulb temperature: These lines are oblique lines that differ slightly from the enthalpy lines. They are identically straight but are not exactly parallel to each other. These intersect the saturation curve at DBT point.

* Relative humidity: These hyperbolic lines are shown in intervals of 10%. The saturation curve is at 100% RH, while dry air is at 0% RH.

* Humidity ratio: These are the horizontal lines on the chart. Humidity ratio is usually expressed as mass of moisture per mass of dry air (pounds or kilograms of moisture per pound or kilogram of dry air, respectively). The range is from 0 for dry air up to 0.03 (lbmw/lbma) on the right hand &quot;ω&quot;-axis, the ordinate or vertical axis of the chart.

* Specific enthalpy: These are oblique lines drawn diagonally downward from left to right across the chart that are parallel to each other. These are not parallel to wet bulb temperature lines.

* Specific volume: These are a family of equally spaced straight lines that are nearly parallel.

The region above the saturation curve is a two-phase region that represents a mixture of saturated moist air and liquid water, in thermal equilibrium.

The protractor on the upper left of the chart has two scales. The inner scale represents sensible-total heat ratio (SHF). The outer scale gives the ratio of enthalpy difference to humidity difference. This is used to establish the slope of a condition line between two processes. The horizontal component of the condition line is the change in sensible heat while the vertical component is the change in latent heat.

===How to read the chart: fundamental examples===
Psychrometric charts are available in SI (metric) and IP (U.S./Imperial) units. They are also available in low and high temperature ranges and for different pressures. 
* Determining relative humidity: The percent relative humidity can be located at the intersection of the vertical dry bulb and diagonally down sloping wet bulb temperature lines. Metric (SI): Using a dry bulb of 25 °C and a wet bulb of 20 °C, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. U.S/Imperial (IP): Using a dry bulb of 77 °F and a wet bulb of 68 °F, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. In this example the humidity ratio is 0.0126 kg water per kg dry air.
* Determining the effect of temperature change on relative humidity: For air of a fixed water composition or &quot;moisture ratio&quot;, find the starting relative humidity from the intersection of the wet and dry bulb temperature lines. Using the conditions from the previous example, the relative humidity at a different dry bulb temperatures can be found along the horizontal humidity ratio line of 0.0126, either in kg water per kg dry air or pounds water per pound dry air. 
: A common variation of this problem is determining the final humidity of air leaving an air conditioner evaporator coil then heated to a higher temperature. Assume that the temperature leaving the coil is 10°C (50°F) and is heated to room temperature (not mixed with room air), which is found by following the horizontal humidity ratio from the dew point or saturation line to the room dry bulb temperature line and reading the relative humidity. In typical practice the conditioned air is mixed with room air that is being infiltrated with outside air.

* Determining the amount of water to be removed or added in lowering or raising relative humidity: This is the difference in humidity ratio between the initial and final conditions times the weight of dry air.

===Mollier diagram===

The &quot;Mollier &quot;i&quot;-&quot;x&quot;&quot; (Enthalpy – Humidity Mixing Ratio) diagram, developed by Richard Mollier in 1923, is an alternative psychrometric chart, preferred by many users in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and Russia.

The underlying psychrometric parameter data for the psychrometric chart and the Mollier diagram are identical. At first glance there is little resemblance between the charts, but if the chart is rotated by ninety degrees and looked at in a mirror the resemblance becomes apparent. The Mollier diagram coordinates are enthalpy and humidity ratio. The enthalpy coordinate is &quot;skewed&quot; and the lines of constant enthalpy are parallel and evenly spaced. The ASHRAE psychrometric charts since 1961 use similar plotting coordinates. Some psychrometric charts use &quot;dry-bulb temperature&quot; and &quot;humidity ratio&quot; coordinates.

<text>In criminology, a political crime or political offence is an offence that prejudices the interests of the state or its government. States may criminalise any behaviour perceived as a threat, real or imagined, to the state&#x27;s survival, including both violent and non-violent opposition. A consequence of such criminalisation may be that a range of human rights, civil rights, and freedoms are curtailed, and conduct which would not normally be considered criminal &quot;per se&quot; (in other words, that is not antisocial according to those who engage in it) is criminalised at the convenience of the group holding power.

Thus, there may be a question of the morality of a law which simply criminalises ordinary political dissent, even though the majority of those who support the current regime may consider criminalisation of politically motivated behaviour an acceptable response when the offender is driven by more extreme political, ideological, religious or other beliefs.

Political crime is to be distinguished from state crime, in which states break their own criminal laws or international law.

==Overview==
At one extreme, crimes such as treason, sedition, and terrorism are political because they represent a direct challenge to the government in power. Espionage is usually considered a political crime. But offenders do not have to aim to overthrow the government or to depose its leaders to be acting in a way perceived as &quot;political&quot;. A state may perceive it threatening if individuals advocate change to the established order, or argue the need for reform of long-established policies, or engage in acts signifying some degree of disloyalty, e.g. by burning the nation&#x27;s flag in public. But the scope of such crimes can be rather less direct.

Structural functionist criminologists recognise that states invest their resources in maintaining order through social conformity, i.e. a particular culture is encouraged and maintained through the primary social discourses which may include religious, economic, social, or other less formal concerns. Any interference with the media of communication or the sets of meanings embedded in the communications themselves may be perceived as a threat to the political authority of the state. Hence, whether in hard copy or electronically, if individuals distribute material containing uncensored information which undermines the credibility of state-controlled news media, this may be considered threatening.

Moreover, even an offence against non-governmental institutions, persons, or practices may be deemed political. Violence or even discrimination against an ethnic or racial group, as well trade union strikes or picketing against private employers, can be perceived as a political crime when those in power see such conduct as undermining the political (and economic) stability of the state. In this context, note that the Law Enforcement Code of Conduct passed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police says in part: &quot;The fundamental duties of a police officer include serving the community, safeguarding lives and property, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice&quot; (cited in Robinson, 2002). This code requires that police behave in a courteous and fair manner, that they treat all citizens in a respectable and decent manner, and that they never use unnecessary force. When they do, it is argued that this constitutes a crime (e.g. as an assault) and, if it is institutionalised, then over time, the use of unnecessary force become a state crime.

Marxist criminologists argue that most political crime arises from the efforts of the state to reproduce the structures of inequality: racism, sexism, ethnic preference as well as class advantages. Thus, states will protect property rights and reduce the rights of trade unions to represent the interests of the poor. Even war could be grounded in the problems of local capitalists in wealthy countries in the effort to move raw materials, profits and jobs in a globalised political economy, and opposing such a war will be a political crime. Marxists do not dispute that, for a society to function efficiently, social order is necessary. But they consider that, in all societies, one class, usually characterised as the &quot;ruling class&quot;, gains far more than other classes. Marxists agree with functionalists that socialisation plays a crucial role in promoting conformity and order. However, unlike the latter, they are highly critical of the ideas, values and norms of &quot;capitalist ideology&quot;. Modern Marxists point to education and the media as socialising agencies, which delude or &quot;mystify&quot; the working class into conforming to a social order, which works against its real interests. Thus, all controls which directly or indirectly exploit the criminal law to control access to the discourses are political crimes.

==Authoritarian governments==
Miller says that one of the defining characteristics of power in modern history has been the rationalisation and bureaucratisation of law. Legal codification, or at least debates over the merits of legal codification, became an almost global phenomenon in the nineteenth century as state power was centralised. In particular, the rationalisation of criminal law standardised not just the concept of crime, but was adopted as the means to eliminate the &quot;deviant&quot; as a threat to a modern, uniform, moral standard. In this, the religious establishment began to play a new role in defining &quot;evil&quot; in which threats to the political or social norm became as dangerous as threats to religious orthodoxy. Thus, political speech became one of the most likely activities to be criminalised. The freedom of association and to meet may also be criminalised if the purpose is to express oppositional political views.

Because a political offender may be fighting against a tyrannical government, treaties have usually specified that a person cannot be extradited for a political offense (the political offence exception). Thomas Jefferson wrote:
==Specific crimes==

===Terrorism===

People convicted or suspected of certain crimes classified as terrorism by the government of their country (or some foreign countries) reject that classification. They consider that their fight is a legitimate one using legitimate means, and thus their crimes should be more appropriately called political crimes and justify special treatment in the penal system (as if they were soldiers in a war and therefore covered by the Geneva Convention). States tend to consider the political nature of the crimes an aggravating factor in the sentencing process and make no distinction between the terrorists and &quot;ordinary&quot; offenders, e.g. the convicted murderers of Action Directe consider themselves political prisoners.

===Religious crimes===

Where there is no clear separation between the state and the prevailing religion, the edicts of the church may be codified as law and enforced by the secular policing and judicial authorities. This is a highly functionalist mechanism for enforcing conformity in all aspects of cultural life and the use of the label &quot;crime&quot; adds an extra layer of stigma to those convicted.

<text>SN 1885A (also S Andromedae) was a supernova in the Andromeda Galaxy, the only one seen in that galaxy so far by astronomers. It was the first supernova ever seen outside the Milky Way, though it was not appreciated at the time due to how far away it was. It is also known as &quot;Supernova 1885&quot;.

==Discovery==

The supernova appears to have been seen first on August 17, 1885, by French astronomer Ludovic Gully during a public stargazing event. Gully thought it was scattered moonlight in his telescope and did not follow up on this observation. Irish amateur astronomer Isaac Ward in Belfast claimed to have seen the object on August 19, 1885, but did not immediately publish its existence.

The independent detection of the supernova by Ernst Hartwig at Dorpat (Tartu) Observatory in Estonia on August 20, 1885, however, was communicated in a telegram on August 31, 1885, once Hartwig had verified in more ideal circumstances that the feature was not caused by reflected moonlight. The telegram prompted widespread observations of the event, and prompted Isaac Ward, Ludovic Gully, and several others to publish their earlier observations (the first reports on S Andromedae appeared before Hartwig&#x27;s discovery letter which followed his telegram, since the letter was initially lost by Astronomische Nachrichten and only reprinted in a later issue). The history of the discovery is summarized by K.G. Jones and de Vaucouleurs and Corwin. Both studies doubt that Ward really saw the event since his estimated magnitude is significantly off from the later reconstructed light curve, and conclude that Hartwig should be considered as the discoverer of the supernova.

==Features==
SN 1885A reached magnitude 5.85 on 21 August 1885, and faded to magnitude 14 six months later. It was reddish in color and declined rapidly in brightness, which is unusual for type Ia supernovae. Some astronomers observed the spectrum of the star visually (no photographic spectral observations were made in that time). These observations were made at the limit of visibility, but they were considered to be in good agreement with each other and with modern data on typical supernovae of type Ia; SN 1885A has thus been assigned to this type. Studies led by Dovi Poznanski and by Hagai Perets suggest that SN 1885A belongs to a new subclass of Type I supernovae, along with SN 2002bj and SN 1939B.

The supernova occurred at an angular separation of from the relatively bright nucleus of the galaxy. This made detection of its remnant difficult – early attempts were unsuccessful. In 1988, R. A. Fesen and others used the 4-meter Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak to discover the iron-rich remnant of the explosion. Further observations were made with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999. The spectrum of the remnant shows the presence of iron, calcium and manganese, which were likely created during the explosion. There is some evidence for spherical symmetry in the explosion; this would mean that this type Ia supernova was not triggered by merging.

<text>William Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Wright (January 10, 1835 – October 3, 1895) was an American professional baseball player, manager, and developer. He assembled, managed, and played center field for baseball&#x27;s first fully professional team, the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings. He is credited with introducing innovations such as backing up infield plays from the outfield and shifting defensive alignments based on hitters&#x27; tendencies. For his contributions as a manager and developer of the game, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953 by the Veterans Committee.

Wright was the first to make baseball into a business by paying his players up to seven times the pay of the average working man. He is the oldest former professional player in the Hall: a few other inductees were born before him, but none of them played professionally. His younger brother George Wright is also in the Hall. The Wrights are one of only two pairs of brothers in the Hall, alongside Paul and Lloyd Waner.

== Early life ==
Born in Sheffield, England, he was the eldest of five children of professional cricketer Samuel Wright and his wife, Annie Tone Wright. His family emigrated to the U.S. when he was nearly three years old, and his father found work as a bowler, coach, and groundskeeper at the St George&#x27;s Cricket Club in New York. Harry dropped out of school at age 14 to work for a jewelry manufacturer, and worked at Tiffany&#x27;s for several years.

Both Harry and George, 12 years younger, assisted their father, effectively apprenticing as cricket &quot;club pros&quot;. Harry played against the first English cricket team to tour overseas in 1859.

Both brothers played baseball for some of the leading clubs during the amateur era of the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP). Harry was already 22 when the baseball fraternity convened for the first time in 1857, at which time he joined the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club. He did not play in a game with the Knickerbockers until July 8, 1858, playing the outfield against Excelsior of Brooklyn. The Knickerbockers lost the game, 31–13.

In 1863, the Knickerbocker club all but withdrew from official competition, and Wright joined Gotham of New York, primarily playing shortstop. Here, he joined his brother George, who had become a member of the team the previous year. During the winter of 1864/65, the Wrights played the curious game of &quot;ice base ball&quot;.

== Cincinnati ==
Wright left New York on March 8, 1865, bound for Cincinnati, where he had been hired on salary at the Union Cricket Club. When baseball boomed less than a year later in 1866, the first full peacetime season, he became, in effect, club pro at the Cincinnati Base Ball Club, although he is commonly called simply a baseball &quot;manager&quot; from that time. By now, Wright was 31, probably past his athletic prime.

Cincinnati fielded a strong regional club in 1867. With Wright working as the regular pitcher, and still a superior player at that level, the team won 16 matches and lost only to the Nationals of Washington, D.C., on their historic tour. For 1868 he added four players from the East and one from the crosstown Buckeye club, a vanquished rival. The easterners, at least, must have been compensated by club members if not by the club.

When the NABBP permitted professionalism for 1869, Harry augmented his 1868 imports (retaining four of five) with five new men, including three more originally from the East. No one but Harry Wright himself remained from 1867; one local man and one other westerner joined seven easterners on the famous First Nine. The most important of the new men was brother George, probably the best player in the game for a few years, the highest paid man in Cincinnati at $1400 for nine months. George at shortstop remained a cornerstone of Harry&#x27;s teams for ten seasons.

The Red Stockings toured the continent undefeated in 1869 and may have been the strongest team in 1870, but the club dropped professional base ball after the second season, its fourth in the game. As it turned out, the Association also passed from the scene.

=== Manager ===
During this early era, the rules of the sport for many years prohibited substitution during games except by mutual agreement with opponents, and the role of a team manager was not as specifically geared toward game strategy as in the modern era; instead, managers of the period combined the role of a field manager with that of a modern general manager in that they were primarily responsible for signing talented players and forming a versatile roster, as well as establishing a team approach through practice and game fundamentals.

=== Seventh-Inning Stretch Report ===
In 1869, Wright became the first to make written mention of the Seventh-inning stretch in a game he watched.

== Boston ==

=== The National Association years ===
From an invitation in 1870 by Ivers Whitney Adams, the founder and President of the Boston Red Stockings, Wright moved from managing the &quot;Cincinnati Red Stockings&quot; to work professionally with the first-ever base ball team in Boston, the &quot;Boston Red Stockings&quot;. The team was to play in the newly formed National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, now known more often as simply the National Association.

The Red Stockings finished third in the NA&#x27;s inaugural season. Wright, now 36 years old was the second-oldest player in the league, behind Nate Berkenstock, aged 38. As the team&#x27;s regular center fielder, Wright played 30 of the team&#x27;s 31 games at that position. He also pitched in nine games in relief of Albert Spalding, notching one win.

In 1872, the Red Stockings won its first championship, beating Maryland&#x27;s Lord Baltimore Club by games. They won again the next season, finishing four games ahead of the Philadelphia White Stockings.

1874 turned out to be Wright&#x27;s last year as the team&#x27;s regular center fielder. He had been the oldest player in the NA for three years running. It was also his third straight championship as a manager. That year, he organized what turned out to be a fairly disastrous attempt to take baseball back home to the British Isles.

In 1875, the final year of the NA, the Red Stockings were an amazing 71-8, finishing a full 15 games ahead of the Athletics. Wright, now the oldest player in the league, continued to play regularly in center field for Boston until 1874. After that, he played in just three more games, one in each of the next three seasons.

=== The National League years ===
In 1876, the Boston club joined the new National League. Sportswriters tended to refer to them as the &quot;Red Caps&quot; now, in deference to the resurrected Red Stockings name for the new Cincinnati Club. Although they once again stumbled in their first year in a new league, finishing fourth in 1876, they went on to win two more pennants in the following two seasons with Wright at the helm. The team finished second in 1879, but then slipped badly, finishing sixth in the next two seasons, which wound up being Wright&#x27;s last two seasons in Boston.

== After Boston ==

=== Providence ===
After leaving the Red Caps, Wright quickly picked up with the Providence Grays, one of the stronger NL teams of the era. In 1882, his first season as Grays manager, the team finished in second place, just three games behind the powerful Chicago White Stockings led by Cap Anson. The team dropped to third the following year, and Wright moved on again.

While in Providence, Wright instituted the concept of a farm team. Wright assembled a team of amateurs, which would play at Messer Street Grounds while the Grays were on the road, with the intention that if one of the senior members was injured, he could be easily replaced from among these players.

=== Philadelphia ===
In 1884, Wright was brought in to manage the new Philadelphia team. Philadelphia had joined the National League the previous year, finishing dead last with an abysmal record of 17–81. Under Wright, they improved enough to finish in sixth place in 1884 while winning 20 games more than they had done the previous year. In 1885, the team finished above .500 for the first time, going 56–54 and finishing in third place, a distant 30 games behind the White Stockings and 28 games behind second-place New York Giants.

Philadelphia continued to improve under Wright in 1886, finishing with a record of 71–43, although their position in the league fell to fourth. In 1887, the team finished in second place, just games behind the champion Detroit club. Unfortunately, that was to be the high-water mark of Wright&#x27;s tenure in Philadelphia, as the team hovered in the middle of the pack, finishing between third and fifth every year from 1888 until 1893 (although he missed a large portion of the 1890 season due to problems with his eyesight).

During Wright&#x27;s tenure in Philadelphia, he often clashed with team owners Al Reach and Colonel John I. Rogers. After the 1893 season, his contract was not renewed. The National League, in recognition of Wright&#x27;s standing, offered him the position of Chief of Umpires. During his career, Wright had often served as umpire, even for games involving rival teams, due to his high ethical standards.

== Managerial overview ==

In 23 seasons of managing in the National Association and National League, Wright&#x27;s teams won six league championships (1872–1875, 1877, 1878). They finished second on three other occasions, and never finished lower than sixth. Wright finished his managerial career with 1,225 wins and 885 losses for a .581 winning percentage. He was the first manager to reach one thousand wins as a manager and Cap Anson was the only other manager who won 1,000 games in the 19th century (Wright briefly held the record for most managerial wins, now he ranks 44th). 

== Death ==

Wright died of a lung ailment on October 3, 1895, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was 60 years old. He was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Wright&#x27;s influence on professional baseball was profound and his death reverberated through the sport. The National League dedicated April 13, 1896, as &quot;Wright Day&quot; and the receipts of eight games played that day dedicated to the establishment of a memorial in Wright&#x27;s memory. Albert Spalding, then age 46, agreed to appear at the game in Rockford, Illinois, and Henry Chadwick, age 80, scored the exhibition game in Cincinnati to honor Wright.

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;Harry Wright came to [Philadelphia] in the zenith of his powers as a base ball manager, and what he did for the development of the local end of the national game of base ball is a matter of history. It was here that he passed the evening of his life, beloved by all whose good fortune it was to know him. Here it was that he had his little home stake, and here in the impressive silence of beautiful West Laurel Hill his mortal remains lie buried. His work was an honor to Philadelphians, who will doubtless turn and give substantial evidence of their appreciation of that honor.&quot;

Wright was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2005. His brother George is also a member of both Halls; a third brother, Sam, also played professionally.

<doc id="846434" wikidata="Q179516" url="?curid=846434" title="Paolo Conte">
<text>Paolo Conte (; born 6 January 1937) is an Italian singer, pianist, songwriter and lawyer, known for his distinctly grainy, resonant voice. His compositions fuse Italian and Mediterranean sounds with jazz, boogie and elements of the French and Latin-American rhythms.

==Career==
Conte was born in Asti, Piedmont. His parents were avid jazz fans and Conte and his younger brother Giorgio spent their formative years listening to a lot of early jazz and blues recordings. After obtaining a law degree at the University of Parma, Conte started working as an assistant solicitor with his father, simultaneously pursuing his musical studies. He learned to play the trombone, the vibraphone and the piano, and formed a jazz band with his brother on guitar. Conte&#x27;s skill for composing music and original arrangements was noted by music producer Lilli Greco, who paired Conte with lyricist Vito Pallavicini. They wrote songs for Adriano Celentano (&quot;Azzurro&quot;, 1968), Caterina Caselli (&quot;Insieme a te non ci sto più&quot;, 1968), Fausto Leali (&quot;Deborah&quot;, 1968) and Enzo Jannacci (&quot;Messico e nuvole&quot;, 1970). In 1974 Conte recorded his first album, &quot;Paolo Conte&quot;. The following year, he released another eponymous album. Following a series of well-received shows at Club Tenco in Sanremo in 1976 and the commercial success of his third album, &#x27;Un gelato al limon&#x27;, Conte concentrated almost exclusively on his solo career.

<text>The Dzhugdzhur () or Jugjur, meaning &quot;big bulge&quot; in Evenki, are a mountain range along the western shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, located in Khabarovsk Krai in the far east of Siberia.

The mountains are quite deserted, the one exception being the gold mines that have operated in the range since the 1920s.

==Geography==
The east range is bound by the northwest coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. To the northwest the range limits with the Yudoma-Maya Highlands, to the southwest with the Stanovoy Range, to the south with the Dzhagdy Range, and to the northeast with the Kolyma Mountains. The Maya, the Maymakan, and the Mati are among the rivers having their source in the range.

==Geology==
The range was formed by an asymmetrical fold. The southwestern half of the mountains is composed of gneiss and granite from the Precambrian, while the northeast contains Mesozoic shale and limestone as well as Cretaceous and Paleocene igneous rock.

==Ecology and climate==
The coastal stretch of the range is populated by Japanese stone pine and Dahurian larch. Parts of the range occupied by the Okhotsk-Manchurian taiga ecoregion contain swathes of Jezo spruce up to elevations of 1,300 m. 

The climate is wet and cold, with wet rainy summers and severe winters.

== In popular culture ==
Multiplayer game Team Fortress 2&#x27;s Misha, or more commonly known as &quot;The Heavy&quot; hails from the Dzhugdzhurs, living in a &quot;remote log cabin&quot; located in this mountain range according to Team Fortress 2&#x27;s official site.

<doc id="846446" wikidata="Q4120734" url="?curid=846446" title="Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon">
<text>A Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon is an award presented by the United States Army, Air Force, and Space Force to recognize those noncommissioned officers (NCOs) who have completed a prescribed leadership course at an NCO training school. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard have no equivalent to the Noncommissioned Officer Development Ribbon.

==Army==
The NCO Professional Development Ribbon (established in 1981) is issued by the U.S. Army for completion of any prescribed NCO development courses. The first award of the NCO Professional Development Ribbon is issued for completion of the Basic Leader Course (BLC [former titles of BLC include: the &quot;Warrior Leader Course&quot;, &quot;Primary NCO Course&quot;, &quot;Combat Army Course&quot;, and the &quot;Primary Leadership Development Course&quot;]). When a soldier completes additional schooling such as the Advanced Leaders Course (ALC), Senior Leaders Course (SLC), and Master Leader Course (MLC), an award numeral is worn on the ribbon to denote subsequent satisfactory completion of those courses (2, 3, &amp; 4 respectively). Currently, the numeral &quot;5&quot; is authorized for graduation from the US Army Sergeant Major Academy&#x27;s &#x27;Sergeants Major Course&#x27;. Graduates of the Battle Staff NCO Course, and the legacy First Sergeant Course, do not receive a numeral device for graduation from those courses. The highest numeral authorized for the NCO Professional Development Ribbon is &quot;6&quot; for graduates of the Nominative Leaders Course (NLC). NLC is a two-week strategic leader development course designed to prepare nominative Command Sergeants Major (CSM) and Sergeants Major (SGM) for their duties as CSMs for commanders of 1-2 star Army commands, and Staff Section SGMs at HQDA level of responsibilities. 

The Army NCO Professional Development Ribbon is a green ribbon wide. It has a center strip of of Flag Blue, bordered by stripes of yellow. Equidistant from the edge and center stripes on each side are stripes of yellow. The green and yellow of the ribbon represent the chevrons worn by NCOs. The central stripe of blue represents support of the United States.

==Air Force and Space Force==
The NCO Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon was established by the Secretary of the Air Force on 28 August 1962. The ribbon is awarded to NCOs of the US Air Force and US Space Force for completion of prescribed NCO professional development programs. Approved programs are the NCO Preparatory Course, Airman Leadership School, NCO Leadership School, NCO Academy, and Senior NCO Academy. Select professional development programs of other services may also be counted for award of the ribbon. Eligible courses are the Army Sergeants Major Academy, Navy Senior Enlisted Academy, and Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Academy. Additional awards of the NCO Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

Initially majoring in engineering, Braugher found that he enjoyed acting and graduated with a BA in theatre in 1984. He then attended the Juilliard School&#x27;s Drama Division, graduating in 1988.

==Career==

Braugher&#x27;s first film role was in the 1989 film &quot;Glory&quot; as Thomas Searles, a free, educated black man from the North who joins the first black regiment in the Union Army.

<text>Marta Katarzyna Wiktoria Wiśniewska (born Marta Mandrykiewicz on 12 March 1978 in Łódź, Poland), professionally known as Mandaryna, is a Polish singer, dancer and actress. She rose to fame as the dancer of Polish pop group Ich Troje, and the partner of its leader, Michał Wiśniewski. She embarked on a singing career in 2004, covering Whitesnake&#x27;s &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, which became a hit in Poland. Her first two albums, &quot;Mandaryna.com&quot; and &quot;Mandarynkowy sen&quot;, released in 2004 and 2005, respectively, were met with commercial success. In 2005, Mandaryna sparked a major controversy during her performance at Sopot Festival, which exposed her alleged lack of vocal talent. Nonetheless, the performed song &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Night&quot; became a massive hit and remains arguably her best-known song to date.

==Career==
Throughout her teenage years, Marta Wiśniewska took extensive dancing lessons and was part of several dancing groups. In 2000, she became the dancer and choreographer of Ich Troje, then highly popular Polish pop group. She would become the partner of its lead singer, Michał Wiśniewski, and the couple took part in controversial reality show &quot;Jestem, jaki jestem&quot;, which became a television hit. During the show in 2003 she recorded two songs for Michał and began to prepare her musical career with professionals. She chose the artistic nickname &quot;Mandaryna&quot; deriving from her birth name.

In 2004, Mandaryna debuted as a singer and had a hit with the song &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, a cover version of a Whitesnake song, produced by Groove Coverage. Later in the summer, her debut album &quot;Mandaryna.com&quot; was released, going on to sell well and achieving gold certification in Poland. It was then released in Germany and Austria. In 2005, Mandaryna took part in Sopot Festival, performing live her new song &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Night&quot;. The performance, which proved her lacking singing abilities, caused nationwide controversy and Mandaryna became the object of a backlash. Nonetheless, &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Night&quot; became a massive hit in Poland and the follow-up second album, &quot;Mandarynkowy sen&quot;, reached number 1 spot in the albums chart in Poland. The album also featured a cover of Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;, which was released as the next single to considerable success.

In 2006, Mandaryna released the single &quot;Stay Together&quot; and started recording her third studio album. She also filmed her own short-lived, yet successful TV show &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance, czyli zrobię dla was wszystko&quot;. In 2007, she recorded a new song, &quot;Heaven&quot;, which again caused a stir, after it was proclaimed a rip-off of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Jump&quot;. In the same year, she opened her first Mandaryna Dance Studio, which has since evolved into a chain of successful dance schools, and regularly appeared on &quot;Rozmowy w toku&quot;, a popular talk show. The release of her third studio album, &quot;Third Time: Mandaryna4You&quot;, was scheduled to January 2008, but due to a serious conflict between Mandaryna, her manager Katarzyna Kanclerz and music producer Marek Sośnicki, its release was pulled and it now remains unreleased. She founded a short-lived band, 2be3, and recorded a cover of New Kids on the Block&#x27;s &quot;Step by Step&quot; with them. In 2009, she made a comeback with the album &quot;AOK&quot;. Although the album failed to chart, its only single &quot;Good Dog Bad Dog&quot;, an electropop song with elements of rap, earned considerable popularity.

&quot;Good Dog Bad Dog&quot; was written and produced by Ali Alien and Marek Śledziewski, then remixed by Josh Harris, an American producer. The videoclip for the song was shot within six days in Poland. It premiered on 12 October 2009 on Polish division of VIVA. The song was performed on Polish breakfast TV show &quot;Dzień Dobry TVN&quot;. The song and the video met with positive response but received little airplay on Polish mainstream radio stations and television, apart from VIVA.

In 2010, she appeared as a member of the judging panel on popular TV show &quot;Hot or Not&quot; on VIVA Poland. She also announced working on her next studio album, due in early 2011 and initially called &quot;Sugar Sugar&quot;. The album was not released, but in 2012 Mandaryna came back with a new single, &quot;Bring the Beat&quot;. In 2013, Marta Wiśniewska announced she has ended her musical career and instead is going to focus on developing her dance school business.

In 2018 she announced her musical comeback with performances in some clubs in Poland.

==Private life==
Mandaryna was married to Michał Wiśniewski, the lead singer of the Polish pop group Ich Troje. She has two children with Wiśniewski, Xavier Michał (born 24 June 2002) and Fabienne Marta (born 21 August 2003), both born in Warsaw. She has been in a long-term relationship with Wojtek Bąkiewicz, a Polish photographer for &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;CKM&quot; magazines. She&#x27;s a diabetic.

<text>Patrick McKenna (born May 8, 1960) is a Canadian comedian and actor. He is best known for playing Harold Green on the television series &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; and Marty Stevens on the television series &quot;Traders&quot;.

==Early life==
Patrick McKenna became interested in Second City when a high-school teacher took him to a show at Second City Toronto. After he graduated from high school, he attended Sheridan College, graduating with a business degree in 1982.
==Career==
To help with tuition, he worked his way to being night manager at Second City, learning how improv worked. In 1983, he auditioned successfully for the main stage. During the 1980s he tried his hand at standup and spent five years performing his act in Canada and the US.

One night at Second City during the late 1980s, McKenna received the acting offer which would change his life. Steve Smith was recruiting cast members, especially a sidekick, for his new project, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. He had come to Second City and was checking out the entire troupe, but when Patrick did his twitchy-nerd character, Smith knew he had his sidekick. He offered McKenna a job after the show. McKenna appeared on television screens throughout Canada and the US for the next 15 years as the lovable nephew Harold Green on &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, a part he would reprise in the feature film &quot;Duct Tape Forever&quot;.

He also played Marty Stephens on &quot;Traders&quot;, working alongside future &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; Canadian actor David Hewlett. For his work on &quot;Traders&quot; and &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, McKenna received two Gemini Awards. He is the only Canadian actor to win for both drama and comedy in the same year, at the 13th Gemini Awards on 4 October 1998.

McKenna guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; playing Dr. Jay Felger, first in the season 6 episode &quot;The Other Guys&quot; and then in the season 7 episode &quot;Avenger 2.0&quot;. He also starred in the 2002 &quot;Trudeau&quot; miniseries. 

In 2006, McKenna played producer Jeffrey Littleman on the short-lived CBC television series &quot;Getting Along Famously&quot;. In 2007, he appeared in the pilot of &quot;Sabbatical&quot;. He starred as Victor in the 2011 indie horror film &quot;Silent but Deadly&quot;. In late 2011, he played the politician and Canadian Confederation leader Alexander Galt in the CBC television movie &quot;John A: Birth of a Country&quot;. Throughout the mid-2000s and early 2010s, McKenna saw work as a voice actor in Canadian animated series such as &quot;Atomic Betty&quot;, &quot;Iggy Arbuckle&quot;, &quot;Crash Canyon&quot; and &quot;Sidekick&quot;.

McKenna was the subject of the 2009 PBS documentary &quot;ADD and Loving It?!&quot; McKenna has ADHD, but was not diagnosed until he was well into his forties. He has become somewhat of a spokesman on this condition in Canada. McKenna and Rick Green, writer and performer and co-creator of &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, made a documentary to explain some of ADHD&#x27;s positives and negatives titled &quot;ADD and Loving It.&quot; Both men open up about how it has affected them and their relationships.

==Charitable work==
McKenna has become involved with many charity organizations and causes—including wheelchair athletes, Adult ADHD, MS Society, Lupus Canada and McMaster Sick Kids—some of which he has personal connection with.

McKenna suffered a debilitating back injury in the early 2000s that left him unable to walk for a year. He went through times of being in a wheelchair and having to learn to walk again. It was from this experience that he became involved with wheelchair athletes.

His mother, Patricia, has suffered from lupus since the 1970s. McKenna&#x27;s friend and fellow Second City alumnus Colin Mochrie and his wife Debra McGrath often help McKenna with lupus charity fundraising.

==Personal life==
McKenna is a member of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Second City&quot; comedy troupe.

McKenna&#x27;s mother&#x27;s name is Patricia, and he has three brothers. He married his high school sweetheart, Janis, in 1983. They have a son, Brendon, born in 1985. Brendon McKenna was seen in two episodes, &quot;Dancing with Mr. D.&quot; and &quot;The Unseen Lever&quot;, of his father&#x27;s series &quot;Traders&quot; as Marty&#x27;s son, Mark Stephens.

<doc id="846468" wikidata="Q28163993" url="?curid=846468" title="Sorath (raga)">
<text>Sorath is an India musical raga (musical mode) that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used; which notes can be used; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune.
In the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy Granth (book) there are a total of 60 raga compositions and this raga is the twenty fifth raga to appear in the series. The composition in this raga appear on a total of 65 pages from page numbers 595 to 660.

Raga Sorath belongs to the Khamaj thaat. Besides Guru Nanak, Sorath was used by Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadar for a total of 150 hymns plus numerous slokas.

Raag Sorath (ਸੋਰਠਿ) – Sorath conveys the feeling of having such a strong belief in something that you want to keep repeating the experience. In fact this feeling of certainty is so strong that you become the belief and live that belief. The atmosphere of Sorath is so powerful, that eventually even the most unresponsive listener will be attracted.

The following represents the order of notes that can be used on the ascending and descending phase of the composition and the primary and secondary notes:

* Arohana: Sa Re Ma Pa Ni Sa
* Avarohana: Sa Re Ni Dha, Ma Pa Dha Ma Ga Re Ni Sa
* Vadi: Re
* Samavadi: Dha

The melodies are characterized by sweeping phrases with glides connecting all leaps, even the shorter ones. Movement is moderately fast.

Raga Sorath is named after Saurashtra, Gujarat.

<doc id="846471" wikidata="Q1538765" url="?curid=846471" title="Gothabilly">
<text>Gothabilly (sometimes hellbilly) is music genre influenced by rockabilly and the goth subculture. The name is a portmanteau word that combines &quot;gothic&quot; and &quot;rockabilly&quot;, first used by the Cramps in the late 1970s to describe their somber blend of rockabilly and punk rock. Since then, the term has come to describe a fashion style influenced by gothic fashion, as seen in its use of black silks, satins, lace and velvet, corsets, top hats, antique jewellery, PVC, and leather.

==Characteristics==
Gothabilly is distinctly different in sound from psychobilly. While psychobilly fuses 1950s rockabilly with 1970s punk rock in a faster, more aggressive sound, gothabilly fuses bluesy rockabilly with gothic piano and guitar, and is defined by having slower tempos and emphasizing mood over aggression.

==History==
The Cramps have been credited with coining the term &quot;gothabilly&quot;. The term was not popularized until the release of a series of international gothabilly compilation albums released by Skully Records in the mid-1990s.

Gothabilly is particularly active in the western portion of the United States, with many of today&#x27;s bands originating in California.

<doc id="846479" wikidata="Q2062331" url="?curid=846479" title="Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain">
<text>The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is a memorial in London dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in 1997. It was designed to express Diana&#x27;s spirit and love of children.

The fountain is located in the southwest corner of Hyde Park, just south of the Serpentine lake and east of the Serpentine Gallery. Its cornerstone was laid in September 2003 and it was officially opened on 6 July 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II. Also present were Diana&#x27;s younger brother Charles Spencer, her ex-husband Prince Charles (the future Charles III), her sons Prince William and Prince Harry, her ex–father-in-law Prince Philip and her two sisters Lady Jane Fellowes and Lady Sarah McCorquodale. The opening ceremony brought the Windsors and the Spencers together for the first time in seven years.

==Design==

Work on the project began in 2001. The fountain was designed by Gustafson Porter, and cost £3.6 million. Kathryn Gustafson, an American landscape artist, said that she had wanted the fountain to be accessible and to reflect Diana&#x27;s &quot;inclusive&quot; personality. Gustafson said: &quot;Above all I hope that it provides a fitting memorial for the princess and does credit to the amazing person that she was.&quot;

The mechanical and electrical design was completed by Ocmis Ltd, a fountain specialist based in Somerset, UK. Their role was to work alongside Gustafson Porter to design the necessary pumping equipment to achieve the desired water effects, this included the construction of scale mock-ups within their Somerset headquarters.

==Construction==
The 545 individual pieces of Cornish granite were cut using sophisticated computer-guided cutting machines by S. McConnell &amp; Sons, in Kilkeel, Northern Ireland, then transferred to England by sea.

Although described as an oval stone fountain, the memorial has the form of a large, oval stream bed measuring about 50 by 80 m (165 by 260 ft); it surrounds, and is surrounded by, a lush grassy field. The granite stream bed is from 3 to 6 m (10 to 20 ft) wide, is quite shallow and is laid out on a gently sloping portion of the park, so that water pumped to the top of the oval flows down either side. One side of the stream bed descends fairly smoothly to the downhill end of the oval with gentle ripples; the other side consists of a variety of steps, rills, curves, and other shapes so that the water plays in interesting ways as it flows to the tranquil pool at the bottom. The two sides were intended to show two sides of Diana&#x27;s life: happy times, and turmoil.

==Safety and drainage==

Diana was seen as a contemporary and accessible princess, so the goal of the memorial fountain was to allow people to access the structure and the water for quiet wading and contemplation. However, shortly after its opening, and after three hospitalisations caused by people slipping in the water, the fountain was closed. It reopened in August 2004, surrounded by a new fence, and people were prevented from walking or running in the water by six wardens. 

Even though the fountain was only open for a part of the 2004 season, and the weather was not particularly wet, the grass adjacent to part of the fountain was badly damaged, and it appeared that it would turn to a quagmire if heavy rain ever fell during the main visiting season. Thus, in December 2004, another alteration project was started. This involved work on the drainage, together with laying new hard surfaces on some of the most frequently walked areas of the site and the planting of a special hard-wearing rye grass mix in others.

<doc id="846485" wikidata="Q806252" url="?curid=846485" title="Bandai Visual">
<text>was a Japanese anime, film production, and distribution company, established by Bandai and a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings. They focused mainly in international distribution of anime properties in North America.

Most of the anime and films that have been distributed and licensed by Bandai Visual have been released under the Emotion label. After the reorganization of Bandai Namco Holdings in 2006, Bandai Visual headed the group&#x27;s Visual and Music Content Strategic Business Unit. Its subsidiaries included the Emotion Music Company, Ltd. (whose logos also include the Moai from Easter Island), and Lantis music publishing labels. Until 2012, it was involved in the production and distribution of several anime titles, including those it has directly produced itself and anime series produced by the anime studio Sunrise, an alternate anime studio subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings. In September 2017, Bandai Visual acquired the anime studio Actas.

In February 2018, it was announced Bandai Visual would be merged with Lantis into a new branch of BNH, called Bandai Namco Arts. The reorganizing took effect as of April 1, 2018. Bandai Visual remains only as a label of the new company.

== History ==
=== Origins and expansion (1983–1996) ===
On August 23, 1983, Japanese toy manufacturer Bandai established AE Planning Co., Ltd. (Account Executive Planning), an animation and film distributor, in Kōjimachi, Chiyoda. Bandai created AE Planning following the success of Emotion, its film distribution division, in 1982, and was part of Bandai&#x27;s corporate reorganization and alteration of its business strategies. AE Planning primarily distributed original video animations (OVAs) from other companies, most notably Pierrot&#x27;s &quot;Dallos&quot; (1983). Beginning in October 1984, it licensed and distributed laserdisc films in Japan. After Bandai agreed to a business alliance with The Walt Disney Company in 1987, AE Planning became a distributor of Disney animated films across the country.

In March 1989, AE Planning renamed itself Bandai Visual Sales and opened a second office in Shōwa-ku, Nagoya. Alongside its publishing and distribution of VHS releases for television series such as &quot;Ultraman&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, Visual Sales operated the Emotion Theater movie theater in Bandai&#x27;s B-Club Shop in Takadanobaba until its closure in 1997. Bandai Visual Sales was renamed again to Bandai Visual Co., Ltd. in August 1991. In the same year, it absorbed Bandai&#x27;s Media Division as a means to unify the latter company&#x27;s home video distribution businesses. The acquisition also gave Bandai Visual ownership of the Emotion label, which was used for its music, anime re-releases, and other products. As the company continued generating profits, it began expanding its operations into other entertainment industries. In 1996, Bandai Visual began publishing video games under the Emotion Digital Software brand, releasing titles such as &quot;Return to Zork&quot;, &quot;MechWarrior 2: Arcade Combat Edition&quot; and &quot;Choujikuu Yousai Macross: Ai Oboete Imasu ka&quot;.

=== Mainstream success and Bandai Entertainment (1996–2005) ===
In April 1996, Bandai Visual published &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, the sixth mainline installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; media franchise. Though it was a moderate success in Japan, &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; was especially popular in the United States, being credited for single-handedly popularizing the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise for Western audiences. Following the show&#x27;s success, Bandai established a subsidiary named Bandai Entertainment Inc. in Cypress, California as a subsidiary of its United States division, Bandai America. Though Bandai Visual did not have any direct control over Bandai Entertainment, the latter company often licensed many of Visual&#x27;s anime series for publishing and distribution in North America, such as &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, and multiple &quot;Gundam&quot; sequels. Bandai Entertainment also published English-translated manga series and American graphic novels, in addition to offering a &quot;fan support&quot; program to facilitate public screenings of licensed content at anime clubs and anime conventions.

Bandai Visual was listed on JASDAQ market in November 2001; by that time, the company was worth over 2.1 billion (US$20 million). In January 2003, the company acquired Emotion Music and made it a wholly owned subsidiary, as a means to further expand into the music industry. Bandai Visual also began supplying content for broadband distribution networks, such as the Bandai Channel television station.

=== Namco Bandai takeover and merge with Lantis (2005–2018) ===
Bandai Visual was a wholly owned subsidiary of Namco Bandai Holdings. Namco Bandai announced on November 8, 2007, that it would buy the voting shares it did not own between that date and December 10, 2007, and turn the company into a wholly owned subsidiary. On December 18, 2007, Namco Bandai announced that it had owned 93.63% of Bandai Visual&#x27;s shares since the end of November. The remaining shares were delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on February 15, 2008, after Namco Bandai acquired the remaining 10% of the shares.

In February 2018, it was announced Bandai Visual would be merged with Lantis into a new branch of BNH, called Bandai Namco Arts. The reorganizing took effect as of April 1, 2018. Bandai Visual remains only as a label of the new company.

== Subsidiaries ==
=== Bandai Visual USA / Bandai Entertainment ===
Bandai Visual USA was established in 2005 in Cypress, California to license anime properties from various Japanese companies for North American distribution; most of those licenses coming from Bandai and its sister company Sunrise. The company also licensed manga series for release with English translation, and published American-made graphic novels. Bandai Visual USA&#x27;s releases were of high quality and were aimed at collectors. Their titles were released under the Honnêamise label (named after their Bandai Visual&#x27;s first production, Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise). Bandai Visual USA&#x27;s anime products were distributed in North America initially by Image Entertainment and later, Geneon Entertainment USA and in Europe by Beez Entertainment. On May 23, 2008, Bandai Namco Holdings announced that Bandai Visual USA would be merged into the newly formed Bandai Entertainment which was consummated on July 1, 2008.

The company confirmed on January 2, 2012, that they would stop offering new DVD, Blu-ray disc and manga releases by February, but would continue to produce their current library of content. Bandai Entertainment was restructured to focus on licensing anime to other companies. On August 30, 2012, Bandai America announced that it will shut down Bandai Entertainment and discontinue distributing their home video and print catalog on March 1, 2013. They made their final shipment to retailers on November 30, 2012. Many former Bandai Entertainment titles have been re-licensed by other companies, including Funimation, Crunchyroll, Aniplex of America, Discotek Media, Media Blasters, Nozomi Entertainment, Viz Media, Maiden Japan and Sentai Filmworks.

Most of the notable titles that Bandai Entertainment held included &quot;K-On!&quot;, &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;.

=== Beez Entertainment ===
Beez Entertainment was the European branch of Bandai Entertainment that also distributed anime and music and were also owned by Bandai Namco Holdings. The name is an acronym for Bandai Entertainment European Zone. Following the discontinuation of Bandai Entertainment, Beez has also stopped releasing anime in the European market. Their anime releases were licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual USA.

=== Honnêamise ===
Honnêamise was Bandai Visual USA&#x27;s boutique label that distributed deluxe editions of anime and artsier products. The label&#x27;s namesake comes from &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise&quot;. The label was shut down on July 1, 2008, when Bandai Visual USA was absorbed into Bandai Entertainment. The label&#x27;s releases were distributed by Geneon Entertainment USA and Image Entertainment.

== Music ==
In August 2009, Bandai Visual had their first music release on US iTunes with Lantis Sounds. In September 2009, Bandai Visual teamed up with Namco Bandai Games for their periodic release of game sounds (classic and new) to iTunes USA.

<doc id="846495" wikidata="Q347672" url="?curid=846495" title="August Šenoa">
<text>August Ivan Nepomuk Eduard Šenoa (; originally Schönoa; 14 November 1838 – 13 December 1881) was a Croatian novelist, playwright, poet, and editor. Born to an ethnic German and Slovak family, Šenoa became a key figure in the development of an independent literary tradition in Croatian and shaping the emergence of the urban Croatian identity of Zagreb and its surroundings at a time when Austrian control was weaning. He was a literary transitional figure, who helped bring Croatian literature from Romanticism to Realism and introduced the historical novel to Croatia. He wrote more than ten novels, among which the most notable are: (&#x27;The Goldsmith&#x27;s Treasure&#x27;; 1871), (&#x27;Pirates of Senj&#x27;, ; 1876), (&#x27;The Peasant Revolt&#x27;; 1877), and &quot;Diogenes&quot; (1878).

Šenoa was one of the most popular Croatian novelists in his day, and the author of the popular patriotic song &quot;Živila Hrvatska&quot;.

== Biography ==

Šenoa was born in Zagreb on 14 November 1838 to Alois Schönoa, an ethnic German from what is now the Czech Republic who worked as a confectioner and pastry chef for Bishop , who brought him to Zagreb in 1829, and Therese (), a German-speaking Slovak either from Tyrnau or Budapest. August was the oldest of four boys: Teodor (1841–1843); Julije, a playwright and author in his own right (1845–1897); and Aurel, a banker (1847–1913). His mother died giving birth to Aurel in 1847; August was eight years old. Alois never remarried, but raised the three boys alone, with some help from his mother-in-law. Although August is considered to be one of the greatest writers in the Croatian language, neither of his parents ever learned the language, speaking to him in German only. Alois&#x27; contempt for the language was a constant source of conflict between him and August.

Dissatisfied with the introduction of the Croatian language in schools and frustrated by August&#x27;s refusal to speak German, Alois sent August to a Cistercian gymnasium in Pécs, where he learned Hungarian quickly. When German was reinstated as the scholastic language under the so-called &quot;Absolutism of Bach&quot;, August returned home at his father&#x27;s behest to finish his gymnastic education in Gornji grad. While at school, a friend loaned him a copy Ivan Gundulić&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, an epic poem on the conflict with the Ottomans, which he found difficult to understand at first, having to translate it into German and then back into Croatian. Enamored, he began constantly seeking out books in the language, which led him to meet and become friends with Ljudevit Gaj, who allowed him access to his library, just off of St. Mark&#x27;s Square. The friendship blossomed; Gaj encouraged Šenoa to read and converse in the Croatian language and Šenoa later became a tutor for Gaj&#x27;s son, Velimir. Despite the forcing of German in schools, in Zagreb some of his teachers numbered among the Croatian nationalists of the era, including Vjekoslav Babukić, Antun Mažuranić, and Adolfo Veber Tkalčević, all of whose nationalist activism had a strong impact on Šenoa. In 1855, he published his first work, &quot;Tears&quot; (). The following year, he graduated gymnasium and traveled with a friend through Slovenia and Italy, which inspired him to write &quot;A Carnation on the Grave of a Poet&quot; (), one of his earliest Pan-Slavist works. These travels and his talent for foreign language inspired Šenoa to seek out a career in diplomacy. He took an entrance exam in order to pursue it, but he was rejected on the grounds of his beliefs and his lack of noble birth.

As a university student, Šenoa studied law in Prague and Zagreb and medicine in Vienna. His time in medicine, however, was short-lived, as he could not stand the sight of human blood while working on live patients. His educational success earned him the financial support of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer, who helped pay for Šenoa&#x27;s law school with a yearly stipend of 300 forints. During his time in Prague, he learned Czech and published several articles in several Bohemian newspapers, including &#x27; and &quot;Zlatá Praha&quot;. In 1860, he began writing articles and sending them to &#x27; and continued to be published, writing about cultural and political events and advocating for brotherhood between Croats and Serbs. During this time, Šenoa began writing songs in Czech under both the pseudonym Veljko Rabačević and his own name. Notably, while writing for &quot;Pozor&quot;, he also used the pseudonym Petrica Kerempuh, a reference to the folk hero from northwestern Croatia who ridicules the powerful.

In 1865, Šenoa graduated from the Law Faculty of Prague, but, due to a preoccupation with writing and a loss of interest in the legal profession, failed to pass his qualifying exam. As a result, both Strossmeyer, who had promised him a professorship at the University of Zagreb, and his father were infuriated and both cut him off financially. Despite this, Šenoa moved to Vienna again, at the invitation , becoming the editor of the magazines &quot;Glasonoša&quot; (&#x27;The Herald&#x27;) and &quot;Slawische Blätter&quot; (&#x27;Slavic Pages&#x27;). The following year, he returned to Zagreb to become a part of the editorial staff for &quot;Pozor&quot; and contributing articles criticizing the contemporary theater scene, denigrating its lack of Croatian language and poor quality. His pieces earned him the enmity of Dimitrija Demeter.

When the editors of &quot;Pozor&quot; moved to Vienna, Šenoa stayed in Zagreb, having fallen in love with his future wife, Slava Ištvanić, the daughter of a Velika Gorica notary and judge. The couple met at a ball in Velika Gorica on 31 January 1867 and by Easter of the same year, the two were engaged. However, Slava&#x27;s father refused to officially sanction the marriage until Šenoa got a &quot;real job&quot; which could reliably support the couple. During this period, Šenoa&#x27;s oeuvre contains a significant number of romantic poems, including &quot;O Uskrsu&quot; (&#x27;On Easter&#x27;) and &quot;Slavici&quot; (&#x27;To Slavica&#x27;). In March 1868, his comedy &quot;Ljubica&quot; (&#x27;Violet&#x27;) was published and met with critical and commercial failure. Though later rehabilitated, the piece was, and to some degree still is, considered a particularly heavy-handed satire and even Šenoa&#x27;s colleague condemned it in &quot;Pozor&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he became a notary, thereby fulfilling the requirement to marry Slava; her father blessed the marriage and the two were married on 20 June 1868 in Velika Gorica. In August, he became the artistic director of the Croatian National Theater.

At the end of August 1870, he was removed as the artistic director at the HNK, but remained as a playwright. With his help, the theater was able to attract Ivan Zajc to direct an opera. In January 1873, became a city senator and was put in charge of four branches: guilds, rural zadruge, social welfare and almshouses, and municipal policing; annually, he and his department handled over 2,500 cases on a salary of 130 forints per month. He worked as a judge on Tuesdays without pay. The job became so overwhelming that he had to leave his position at the theater, though he continued writing at night. In 1875, he attempted a career in politics, but quickly reversed course. In 1877, he became the vice president of Matica hrvatska and, the following year, became the editor of its arts and sciences journal, &quot;Vienac&quot;. He wrote several pieces for the journal and translated several works from English, Czech, German, and French.

When the 1880 Zagreb earthquake struck, it devastated the entire city. As city senator, he spent all day assessing damage, climbing through collapsed buildings (including attics and basements that had been ravaged by the event), and gave the assessment to the magistrates so they could dictate what to demolish and what to repair. He further took care of victims, by coordinating their care in the barracks-turned-makeshift hospital in Zrinski Square. The work, grief, and exertion took a lasting toll on him. Despite a complicating case of pneumonia, he continued to write his last work, &quot;The Curse&quot; (), until he could no longer do so, then dictating to his wife and son Milan.

Šenoa died on 13 December 1881. It is unclear exactly what the final cause of death was; he complained of painful, swollen joints and then had a heart attack in June 1881. It is generally accepted that he died of complications from chronic pneumonia and untreated post-streptococcal reactive arthritis. He was buried in Mirogoj Cemetery two days later. His funeral was attended by thousands and included Croatia&#x27;s most notable figures of the era, including Ivan Mažuranić, Nikola Krestić, and Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski.

== Work ==
Šenoa&#x27;s contributions to Croatian literature are often considered peerless; he is called the &quot;father of the Croatian novel&quot; and of Croatian realism. The short period in which he wrote his oeuvre is even called the &quot;&quot; (). His novels and plays have been framed as embodying the &quot;Volksgeist&quot; of the era and leaving behind the traditional view of Croatia&#x27;s precarious position at the center of the crossroads of Europe, flanked by the Orthodox East and Ottoman Turks to the south, leaving Croatia to &quot;[pin] all her hopes upon the House of Habsburg&quot;. Rather, he paints the Austro-Hungarian Empire as an enticing Western woman. Tatiana Kuzmic, a professor of the South Slavic languages at Harvard University, notes the following about this characterization:

His work advocated deeply for a national unity across Yugoslavia by appealing to the shared characteristics rather than their differences. He compared the five Yugoslav peoples – Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Bosnians, and Montenegrins – to the five fingers of a single hand and appealed his Yugoslavism to the public through common &quot;blood enemies&quot;. 

Šenoa wrote his novels as distant historical fiction, as critiquing the current political situation could have proved dangerous and opened himself to censorship; both &quot;The Goldsmith&#x27;s Treasure&quot; and &quot;The Peasant Revolt&quot; take place in the 16th century. In an 1874 issue of &quot;Vienac&quot;, he wrote:

In his novels, he fused national romanticism characterized by buoyant and inventive language with realistic depictions of the growth of the petite bourgeois class.

His work is known for Cecildemillean scenes and poetic description of oppressed Croatian peasantry and nobility struggling against foreign rule (Venetians, Austrians/Germans and Hungarians) and romanticized period from the 15th to the 18th century. Šenoa is often credited with &quot;creating the Croatian reading public&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2008, a total of 182 streets in Croatia were named after August Šenoa, making him the person with the seventh most streets in the country named after him.

Šenoa&#x27;s birth house is located at 27 Ivo Mallin House. It is open to visitors. The house suffered damage in the 2020 Zagreb earthquake, but was later reopened.

<text>In the differential geometry of curves, a roulette is a kind of curve, generalizing cycloids, epicycloids, hypocycloids, trochoids, epitrochoids, hypotrochoids, and involutes. On a basic level, it is the path traced by a curve while rolling on another curve without slipping.

== Definition ==

=== Informal definition ===

Roughly speaking, a roulette is the curve described by a point (called the &quot;generator&quot; or &quot;pole&quot;) attached to a given curve as that curve rolls without slipping, along a second given curve that is fixed. More precisely, given a curve attached to a plane which is moving so that the curve rolls, without slipping, along a given curve attached to a fixed plane occupying the same space, then a point attached to the moving plane describes a curve, in the fixed plane called a roulette.

=== Special cases and related concepts ===
In the case where the rolling curve is a line and the generator is a point on the line, the roulette is called an involute of the fixed curve. If the rolling curve is a circle and the fixed curve is a line then the roulette is a trochoid. If, in this case, the point lies on the circle then the roulette is a cycloid.

A related concept is a glissette, the curve described by a point attached to a given curve as it slides along two (or more) given curves.

=== Formal definition ===
Formally speaking, the curves must be differentiable curves in the Euclidean plane. The &quot;fixed curve&quot; is kept invariant; the &quot;rolling curve&quot; is subjected to a continuous congruence transformation such that at all times the curves are tangent at a point of contact that moves with the same speed when taken along either curve (another way to express this constraint is that the point of contact of the two curves is the instant centre of rotation of the congruence transformation). The resulting roulette is formed by the locus of the generator subjected to the same set of congruence transformations.

Modeling the original curves as curves in the complex plane, let formula_1 be the two natural parameterizations of the rolling ( and fixed curves, such that formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 for all formula_5. The roulette of generator formula_6 as formula_7 is rolled on formula_8 is then given by the mapping:

:formula_9

== Generalizations ==
If, instead of a single point being attached to the rolling curve, another given curve is carried along the moving plane, a family of congruent curves is produced. The envelope of this family may also be called a roulette.

Roulettes in higher spaces can certainly be imagined but one needs to align more than just the tangents.

==Example==
If the fixed curve is a catenary and the rolling curve is a line, we have:

:formula_10

:formula_11

The parameterization of the line is chosen so that 
:formula_12

Applying the formula above we obtain:

:formula_13

If &quot;p&quot; = −&quot;i&quot; the expression has a constant imaginary part (namely −&quot;i&quot;) and the roulette is a horizontal line. An interesting application of this is that a square wheel could roll without bouncing on a road that is a matched series of catenary arcs.

<text>Kenneth Eugene Harvey (born March 1, 1978) is a former Major League Baseball first baseman.

Harvey earned consensus first-team All-America honors in 1999 at Nebraska, leading the Huskers to a Big 12 Tournament title and an NCAA appearance. He led the nation with a .478 average, while hitting 23 homers and driving in 86 runs. Although he made his name on offense, Harvey was the Easton Redline Defensive Player of the Year after committing just two errors in 1999. A career .426 hitter, Harvey was selected in the fifth round of the 1999 MLB Draft by the Kansas City Royals.

Harvey played his rookie season in Kansas City in 2003. After an impressive first half of the 2004 season, featuring an early battle with Baltimore Orioles Melvin Mora for the AL lead in batting average, Harvey was selected as the Royals&#x27; lone representative in the All-Star Game. In interleague play with no designated hitter, the Royals played Harvey in left field in order to keep both Harvey and 1B/DH Mike Sweeney, their two most productive bats, in the lineup.

After struggling the second half of the 2004 season, Harvey found himself battling Calvin Pickering for his roster spot the following spring. After hitting .238 in spring training, the Royals sent Harvey to their Triple-A Omaha affiliate on March 29, 2005. In 18 games at Omaha, Harvey hit .375 with three home runs and 14 RBI and was recalled less than a month later on April 28. However, after playing in only 12 games, during which he batted just .222 with five RBI, Harvey was placed on the disabled list on May 22 due to recurring back problems.

On December 8, 2006, Harvey signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins with an invitation to spring training. He opted for minor league free agency on November 3, 2007. In 2008, he played for the Kansas City T-Bones in the independent Northern League. He split the 2009 season between the T-Bones and the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the independent Atlantic League.

<doc id="846511" wikidata="Q1274152" url="?curid=846511" title="Reno Air Races">
<text>The Reno Air Races, or Roswell Air Races, officially known as the National Championship Air Races, are a multi-day event tailored to the aviation community that took place each September at the Reno Stead Airport a few miles north of Reno, Nevada, with the last races held in 2024. The Reno Air Racing Association plans to resume racing at a new venue in Roswell, 2025. Air racing is billed as &quot;the world&#x27;s fastest motor sport&quot; and Reno was one of the few remaining venues. The event includes races in six classes and demonstrations by airshow pilots.

==History==
Beginning in 1964, the Reno Air Races feature multi-lap, multi-aircraft races among extremely high performance aircraft on closed ovoid courses which range between about (Biplanes and Formula One) and about (Jet, Unlimited) in length per lap. The chief organizer is the Reno Air Racing Association (RARA).

The first Reno air races, in 1964 and 1965, were organized by World War II veteran Bill Stead. They took place at Sky Ranch airfield, a dirt strip barely long, which was located in present-day Spanish Springs. After Stead Air Force Base (20 miles to the west, and named in honor of Bill&#x27;s brother, Croston Stead) was closed in 1966, that field was turned over for public use, and the races have been held there since then.

Aircraft in the Unlimited class, which consists almost entirely of modified and stock World War II fighters, routinely reach speeds in excess of 400 miles per hour. In 2003, Skip Holm piloted Terry Bland&#x27;s modified P-51D Mustang, Dago Red, and reached an all-time Unlimited class speed record of 507.105 mph in a six-lap race around the -mile course. The recently added Sport Class racers, mostly homebuilt aircraft, are reaching speeds in excess of 400 mph. In 2009, Curt Brown set a record of 543.568 mph in his jet-engine L-29 Viper.

The Reno Air Races include two and a half days of qualifying, followed by four and a half days of multi-aircraft heat racing, culminating in the Unlimited Class Gold Race on Sunday afternoon. The event also features civil airshow acts and military flight demonstrations between races, plus vendor areas and a large civil and military static aircraft display.

In 2001 the remainder of the event was cancelled because of the grounding of US aviation following the attacks on 11 September. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused the 57th annual race to be cancelled and deferred to 2021. 

The 2024 air races were the last race held in Reno. Following a nationwide search to locate a new home, the Reno Air Racing Association moved the location of the 2025 air races to Roswell, New Mexico.

==Fatalities==
===Before 2011===
From 1964 through 2010, 19 aviators lost their lives due to crashes and collisions in the course of the competition and airshow. In 2007, three pilots died over the course of four days in separate incidents: Gary Hubler, Steve Dari, and Brad Morehouse. Racing was suspended for one day after the last of the three incidents.

===2011 crash===

On September 16, 2011, a heavily modified P-51D Mustang named &quot;The Galloping Ghost,&quot; piloted by Jimmy Leeward, crashed near the stands during the Gold Heat of the race, killing Leeward and ten spectators, and injuring 69. Race organizers cancelled all remaining 2011 races after the accident.

===2014===
A custom built race plane named &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; crashed on the course during qualifying for a Sport Class heat race on September 8, 2014, killing the pilot, Lee Behel.

===2022===
In the third lap of the Jet Gold final race on September 18, 2022 an L-29 Super Delfin went down on the back section of the course after presumed G-LOC, killing the pilot Aaron Hogue.

===2023===
On September 17, 2023, two North American T-6 Texans collided following the conclusion of the T-6 Gold race. Both pilots, Nick Macy and Chris Rushing, were killed in the incident. The remaining three races scheduled for Sunday were ultimately cancelled. With the cancellation of the race, it was the final National Championship Air Races in Reno, with the next race planned being the 2025 Roswell Air Races.

The agency also coordinates with the regional ORCA fare card system used by transit operators across the metropolitan area. In 2023, Sound Transit services carried a total of 37.6million passengers and averaged over 114,000 riders on weekdays.

Sound Transit was created in 1993 by King, Pierce and Snohomish counties to build a regional rapid transit system. After an unsuccessful proposal in 1995, the agency&#x27;s &quot;Sound Move&quot; plan for regional light rail, commuter rail, and express bus service was approved by voters in November 1996. ST began operating its express bus service in September 1999, taking over existing routes from local transit agencies. The region&#x27;s first commuter rail line, between Tacoma and Seattle, started in December 2000; the agency&#x27;s first light rail line, Tacoma Link (now the TLine), began service in August 2003. Light rail service in Seattle on Central Link (now the 1Line) began in 2009, and is the largest part of the Sound Transit system in terms of ridership. Union Station in Seattle has served as the agency&#x27;s headquarters since its renovation in 1999.

Sound Transit is independent of local transit agencies and is governed by an eighteen-member board of directors, which consists of elected officials from member jurisdictions and the Secretary of Transportation. It is funded by local sales taxes, property taxes, and motor vehicle excise taxes levied within its taxing district in portions of King, Pierce and Snohomish counties. The agency has passed three major ballot measures to fund system expansion: Sound Move (1996), Sound Transit 2 (2008) and Sound Transit 3 (2016). Planning and construction of transit projects is scheduled to continue until 2041 under the Sound Transit 3 plan, which would expand the light rail network to and 83 stations.

==Services==
Sound Transit operates three main transit services across the Seattle metropolitan area: the Link light rail system, which serves as the rapid transit system for the region; the Sounder commuter rail system from Everett to Lakewood, via Seattle; and the Sound Transit Express bus system across the three counties. In 2023, these systems carried more than 37.6million total passengers, averaging 114,243 riders per day on weekdays. A fourth service, Stride bus rapid transit, is planned to be introduced in the late 2020s. Sound Transit&#x27;s services use a unified livery and paint scheme that consists of blue, teal, and green waves against a white background. Link, Sounder, and Stride all use the same naming scheme for lines and services, which switched from colors to numbers and letters in 2021.

All of Sound Transit&#x27;s services accept cash payment and mobile tickets as well as the regional ORCA card, a contactless proximity card with stored fares and passes. , fares on Link and Sound Transit Express use a flat rate while most Sounder passengers pay based on the traveled distance. Discounts are offered for eligible low-income households, senior citizens, and people with disabilities; passengers under the age of 19 are not charged a fare as part of a statewide program. Sound Transit&#x27;s light rail and commuter rail stations do not have faregates or turnstiles, instead relying on proof of payment that is enforced by fare ambassadors.

, Sound Transit has a fleet of 538 vehicles for use on its services. The fleet is composed of 175 low-floor light rail vehicles for the 1 and 2 Lines; 8 streetcars for the TLine; 78 bilevel cars and 14 locomotives for Sounder; and 319 buses for Sound Transit Express. The entire Link and Sound Transit Express fleet is considered accessible, with level boarding or ramps and lifts. Sounder trains have a high platform with a designated level boarding area for ramps. All vehicles are also equipped to carry bicycles in racks; Sound Transit also provides bicycle cages at some stations. By 2027, the agency plans to deploy an additional 49 light rail vehicles for Link and 44 buses for the Stride bus rapid transit system, including double-decker buses.

===Link light rail===
The Link light rail system encompasses three lines with of track and 43 stations. The three lines, which have no direct connection between each other, are the 1Line between Seattle, Tukwila, and SeaTac; the 2Line between Bellevue and Redmond; and the TLine in central Tacoma. Link trains carried 27.3million passengers in 2023 and averaged 79,633 passengers on weekdays across the 1Line and TLine. It is the fourth-busiest light rail system in the United States by ridership, behind San Diego, Los Angeles, and Boston.

Link trains generally run seven days a week at frequencies of 6 to 24 minutes, with stops spaced closely together. All stations are accessible and most offer connections to nearby buses or a park and ride facility. The system is planned to expand to 83 stations and by 2041, with five lines serving all three counties. 1Line and 2Line trains are operated and maintained under contract with King County Metro and use longer, four-car trainsets that have a typical capacity of 150 passengers in each car. The TLine uses low-floor streetcars, unable to be coupled into pairs, and are the only Sound Transit service to be directly operated and maintained by the agency rather than a contractor.

===Sounder commuter rail===
Sounder is the regional commuter rail service managed by Sound Transit and has two lines that intersect at King Street Station in Downtown Seattle. Trains generally run during rush hours with limited service at other times, including weekend trains for special events. The NLine connects Seattle to Everett, stopping at two intermediate stations in Snohomish County. The SLine connects Seattle to Tacoma and Lakewood, stopping at six other stations in Pierce County and southern King County. Trains are operated under contract by BNSF Railway crews on the company&#x27;s leased tracks, while the vehicles are maintained by Amtrak. Sounder uses a fleet of Bombardier BiLevel Coach passenger cars that each have a seating capacity of 130 to 146 passengers depending on their configuration. They have restrooms, space for bicycles and wheelchairs, tables, cupholders, power outlets, and Wi-Fi. The SLine typically uses an eight-car configuration that carries 950 seated passengers, while the NLine uses two to three cars in normal service that can carry 300 to 450 passengers. In 2023, Sounder trains carried 1.8million total passengers and averaged 6,715weekday boardings.

===Sound Transit Express===
Sound Transit Express is a network of 28 limited-stop express bus routes providing regional service to cities in all three counties, primarily using a network of high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) on state-maintained freeways. Some routes operate seven days a week, while others are limited to rush hours only. These routes normally have wide distances between stops, which are primarily hubs and transfer points in cities and suburban areas where local routes operated by other agencies connect; many stops also have park and ride lots. Sound Transit funded the construction of new transit hubs, park and ride lots, and direct access ramps to the HOV lanes as part of the rollout and expansion of express buses. In 2023, the express buses carried 8.6million total passengers and had a weekday average of 27,895riders. The busiest route that year was Route 550, which connects Seattle to Bellevue and carried 1.17million riders.

The fleet of 319 buses is owned by Sound Transit and includes double-decker buses with up to 81 seats, articulated buses, high-floor motorcoaches, and standard buses with a minimum of 42 seats. These buses include upholstered and cushioned seats that are able to recline, footrests, overhead luggage racks, air conditioning, reading lights, and bicycle racks. Sound Transit Express buses use diesel or compressed natural gas for fuel, along with several hybrid electric buses. They are operated and maintained under contracts with local transit authorities (Community Transit, King County Metro, and Pierce Transit) who also deploy shuttle buses during disruptions to rail services.

===Stride===
A bus rapid transit system, named Stride, was funded by the Sound Transit 3 ballot measure and is scheduled to open in the late 2020s. Stride is planned to have three lines: the S1 Line on Interstate 405 between Burien and Bellevue, scheduled to open in late 2028; the S2 Line on Interstate 405 between Bellevue and Lynnwood, scheduled to open in 2029; and the S3 Line on State Route 522 between Shoreline South/148th station and Bothell, scheduled to open in 2028.

===Paratransit===

Sound Transit contracts with Community Transit, King County Metro, and Pierce Transit to provide paratransit service along the Link light rail network in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Costs are split equally between Sound Transit and the contracted provider within the Link corridor. The agency is not required to operate paratransit service along Sounder and Sound Transit Express routes.

==History==
===Background and early studies===
The waters of Puget Sound and the surrounding region&#x27;s navigable rivers were the primary transportation corridors for the indigenous Coast Salish peoples as well as later settlers who arrived in the 19th century. A series of scheduled steamboat trips in the 1880s grew into the &quot;mosquito fleet&quot;, the main mode of passenger and freight transportation for the growing region through the turn of the 20th century. It waned in importance as railroads and streetcar systems were constructed around Puget Sound; these services, later supplemented by interurban trains, grew in the early 20th century to serve a growing number of passenger commuters. The Seattle Municipal Street Railway had a streetcar and cable railway system by 1935, while private companies ran interurban services north to Everett and south to Tacoma. These rail services were all abandoned or converted into bus routes by 1941 as automobile adoption in the Seattle area contributed to a need for more developed highways and later freeways.

The first major proposal for a rapid transit system to serve Seattle and the surrounding region was drafted by urban planner and civil engineer Virgil Bogue in 1911 as part of a comprehensive plan. Bogue&#x27;s plan was rejected by a wide margin in the March 1912 municipal election; the city&#x27;s three major newspapers had all opposed it. The Forward Thrust program, formed in the 1960s by civic activists, proposed the development of a subway system that covered Seattle, Renton, and Bellevue by 1985. Two-thirds of the $770million (equivalent to $ in dollars) construction cost would be funded by the federal government, contingent on the approval of local funding. The first referendum in February 1968 failed to reach the 60percent supermajority needed to pass; a second attempt was made in May 1970, but failed amid a spree of layoffs by Boeing that severely affected the local economy. The federal earmark was instead used to build the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority&#x27;s subway system in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Seattle Transit System, the successor to the municipal streetcars, struggled to secure funding to modernize its fleet in the 1960s but launched the region&#x27;s first express bus system, named Blue Streak, in 1970 between Downtown Seattle and a park and ride lot in Northgate. The successful route led to plans to develop a network of express buses across the region by using the then-new freeway system and express lanes. The regional water quality agency, Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (Metro), led planning of the network; Metro later took over operations of the Seattle Transit System and a suburban company in January 1973 following the approval of King County voters in a September 1972 special election. Metro Transit&#x27;s ridership reached 66 million passengers in 1980—exceeding its original projections—and an increase in bus trips led to congestion on downtown streets. A tunnel for buses began construction in 1987 and was opened in 1990 for a fleet of dual-mode electric and diesel buses; the tunnel was also designed for eventual conversion to accommodate a rail system.

Metro and the Puget Sound Council of Governments, the inter-county metropolitan planning organization for the Seattle area, completed a study in 1986 to identify potential corridors for a modern light rail system. King County voters approved an advisory measure in November 1988 to endorse accelerated planning of a light rail system as well as a commuter rail line by 2000. The Washington State Legislature also convened a rail development commission to study a regional transit system that later incorporated Metro&#x27;s unfinished plans. The commission endorsed the creation of a regional transit board composed of politicians from King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, which was authorized by the state legislature in 1990. The Joint Regional Policy Committee was formed in 1991 and approved its final long-range plan for regional transit two years later. The $12billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) plan comprised a light rail system from Everett to Tacoma and Redmond; commuter rail from Everett and Tacoma to Seattle; and improvements to local and express buses. It would be funded by sales tax and motor vehicle excise tax revenue within a district that covered the urbanized areas east of Puget Sound between Marysville to the north and Parkland to the south. From 1960 to 1990, the region&#x27;s population had increased by 82 percent and was outpaced by the growth in the number of registered vehicles, which collectively logged 55.2million miles () traveled in 1991.

===Establishment and Sound Move===

The formation of a regional transit authority (RTA) to create a ballot measure to implement and fund the regional transit plan required the approval of the King, Pierce, and Snohomish county councils. By July 1993, all three county councils had voted to join the RTA; the Pierce and Snohomish county councils voted unanimously in favor of joining, while the vote for Metropolitan King County Council passed by a narrow 5–4 margin. The board of directors for the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority, the official name of the RTA, held its first meeting on September 17, 1993, at a former Washington State Department of Transportation office in Bellevue. The new agency was provided space on the 15th floor of the Exchange Building in Downtown Seattle by King County Metro (the successor to Metro) and began preparation of its first ballot measure.

In October 1994, the RTA Board adopted its master plan for regional transit that would be sent to county councils for ratification and placement as a ballot measure. The plan, with a construction cost of approximately $6.77billion (equivalent to $ in dollars), was described as the largest public works project in Seattle&#x27;s history. It included of light rail service that would be completed within 16 years with lines that would connect Downtown Seattle to Lynnwood in the north, Bellevue and Redmond to the east, and Tacoma to the south. The plan also called for a shorter timeline to launch a commuter rail system, which would use an existing of freight tracks from Lakewood to Everett, and an express bus network with eight routes. It was approved by the three county councils by December, with the divided Snohomish County Council narrowly voting 3–2 in favor due to the lack of light rail service to Everett in the first phase of the plan. A $2.5million (equivalent to $ in dollars) demonstration of commuter rail service on the Tacoma–Seattle–Everett corridor during peak hours and for Tacoma Dome events was operated by the RTA in early 1995 as part of preparations for the ballot measure.

The RTA ballot measure would only require a simple majority to pass and was part of a special election on March 14, 1995. The proposal was supported by prominent elected officials, including incumbent governor Mike Lowry, and the &quot;pro&quot; campaign received funding from Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, local retailers The Bon Marché and Nordstrom, and engineering firms. The &quot;no&quot; campaign primarily comprised businessmen from the Eastside region led by mall developer Kemper Freeman; it argued that the plan was too expensive to construct and would not address traffic congestion. The ballot measure was rejected by 53.5percent of voters across the district, with only King County having a majority in favor of the plan due to strong support within the city of Seattle. In Everett, 83percent of voters rejected the ballot measure, attributed to the opposition of local elected officials due to the lack of light rail service for the city in the first phase. The defeat was also attributed to low turnout, especially among younger voters, due to the timing of the election in a non-presidential year.

The regional transit plan had cost $50million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to develop under the RTA and its predecessors; calls to run a second ballot measure with a modified version of the plan found support from the county councils and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. The RTA was reorganized to reduce its spending by 60percent and its 150-person staff was cut to 23 members; a new CEO was hired and Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel was elected as board chair to represent a &quot;clean break&quot; from earlier transit planning. A modified plan with a reduced cost of $3.9billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) and a 10-year timeline was presented in November 1995 by a panel of local elected officials to prepare for legislative approval for a second ballot measure. The new plan, named &quot;Sound Move&quot;, was adopted by the RTA board in May 1996 and was placed on the November 1996 ballot; its development included over 400 public meetings to receive community input. Sound Move only included of light rail within Downtown Tacoma and from Downtown Seattle to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, but retained the commuter rail element of the previous plan and expanded its use of express buses.

On November 5, 1996, the Sound Move plan and its funding package was approved by 56.5percent of voters within the RTA district. It won a majority in all three counties and was approved by 70percent of Seattle voters. The &quot;yes&quot; campaign, largely supported by the same donors as well as smaller contributors, used wider advertisements and grassroots teams; the &quot;no&quot; campaign repeated their criticisms of the plan on fiscal grounds and raised its funds from real estate interests and lobbying groups representing the trucking, homebuilding, and road construction industries. The local funding for the plan would be raised through a 0.4percent sales tax and 0.3percent annual motor vehicle excise tax that took effect on April 1, 1997. The RTA began expanding its staff and moved out of its shared space with Metro in July 1997; its new headquarters occupied several floors at 1100 Second Avenue, a former bank building in Downtown Seattle. The agency moved its offices to Seattle&#x27;s historic Union Station in November 1999 after a renovation and restoration project that cost $23.5million (equivalent to $ in dollars).

===Launch of first services===
Sound Transit was adopted as the brand name for the RTA on August 15, 1997, along with the names &quot;Link&quot; for the light rail system, &quot;Sounder&quot; for the commuter rail system, and &quot;Regional Express&quot; for the bus network. The &quot;Sound Transit&quot; name was chosen due to its use as a double entendre, referring to the Puget Sound region as well as appearing &quot;trustworthy&quot; and &quot;solid&quot;. Over 100 names were suggested by consultants and members of the public to the RTA board; the other finalist for the agency&#x27;s name was &quot;Regional Transit&quot;, which went through several rounds of voting. The agency&#x27;s logo, created by a local firm and described as a &quot;heavyset T with an S winding through it&quot;, was approved in September by the board. Sound Transit approved funding for its first projects the following month by partnering with local transit agencies; Pierce Transit received funding for 15 additional daily trips on its Seattle–Tacoma express buses, while construction of Community Transit&#x27;s park and ride at Ash Way in Lynnwood would be accelerated with new regional funds.

The first component of the Sound Move plan to be fully implemented was the regional express bus system, which was later renamed to Sound Transit Express and approved in late 1998. The first set of nine express bus routes launched on September 19, 1999, and served regional destinations and 33 park and ride lots in the three counties; an existing King County Metro express route from Seattle to Bellevue and Pierce Transit&#x27;s Seattle–Tacoma express were also transferred to Sound Transit. The initial fleet of 117 buses were painted in the agency&#x27;s new livery and included low-floor articulated buses, high-floor coaches, and 20 dual-mode Breda buses leased from King County Metro for use in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel. The express buses accepted the PugetPass, a new inter-agency fare system that replaced commuter passes and was accepted by five regional transit agencies when it launched on September 1, 1999.

The Sounder commuter rail system was originally scheduled to debut with nine daily round trips between Seattle and Tacoma in December 1999, but state funding for track improvements had been jeopardized by the Tim Eyman-led Initiative 695, which capped the state&#x27;s portion of the motor vehicle excise tax at $30. The initiative was passed in November 1999 and later ruled unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court, but the cap was passed by the state legislature; the state&#x27;s withdrawn funding was filled by an allocation of federal transportation funds allocated by the Puget Sound Regional Council. Sound Transit had reached an agreement with the Port of Seattle, Port of Tacoma, and railroad owners BNSF and Union Pacific in April 1999 for use of their tracks, contingent on funding the majority of a $319million improvement project for the Seattle–Tacoma corridor. A new, 40-year agreement was signed with BNSF in April 2000 for the railroad to operate the commuter rail system with its crews for an annual cost of $4million in 2000 dollars (equivalent to $ in dollars).

Sounder trains on the South Line (now the S Line) began service on September 18, 2000, with two round trips from Tacoma to Seattle with intermediate stops at Sumner and Auburn stations. An estimated 657 people rode the morning trains, while 451 rode in the evening. The service used a temporary platform due to a dispute with Tacoma Rail, which owned the tracks leading to the intermodal Tacoma Dome Station hub; the dispute also limited the number of daily trips for trains until an agreement was signed in November 2000. Additional stations were completed and opened by March 2001 to bring the line to seven stations as originally approved in Sound Move; the platform at Tacoma Dome Station opened on September 15, 2003. The initial rollout of the 19 planned Sound Transit Express routes was completed in September 2002 with the launch of the Seattle–Woodinville and Tacoma–University District routes. The bus fleet had grown to 194 vehicles and the service had carried 15million passengers in its first three years of operation. By 2005, Sound Transit had constructed several direct access ramps between bus hubs and HOV lanes on freeways, along with a total of 10,000 stalls at park and ride lots.

===Light rail planning and financial issues===

In November 1999, Sound Transit selected its preferred route for the Central Link corridor between Northgate Transit Center in Seattle and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, which included a surface section in the Rainier Valley area. The section from the University District to the airport, which had been identified as the initial segment in Sound Move, was estimated to cost $1.85billion (equivalent to $ in dollars). The figure exceeded the original budget for the project in Sound Move because of overruns attributed to new elements as well as increased land prices. Construction of the section between Northgate and the University District was contingent on receiving additional funding from the federal government, which had appropriated large grants in the 1990s but was beginning to reduce its funding for new transit projects. Earlier meetings had criticized the use of surface sections through Tukwila and the Rainier Valley, where a more expensive tunnel was rejected, due to their potential effects on displacement and travel time.

The Central Link route included a tunnel between Downtown Seattle and the University District with intermediate stations on First Hill and Capitol Hill that crossed under Portage Bay. The original budget for the tunnel was $557million (equivalent to $ in dollars), but Sound Transit&#x27;s selected contractor produced a low bid that was $171million higher (equivalent to $ in dollars) than expected. The area&#x27;s poor soils and other changes to the design led to a $680million increase (equivalent to $ in dollars) in the estimated cost of the project, which drew criticism from local media and elected officials. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) had previously agreed to a $500million grant (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the tunnel section based on the previous cost figures, but informed Sound Transit that major design changes would require a new agreement. The full agreement was signed by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation shortly before he left office with the rest of the Clinton administration, but it did not guarantee appropriations for the project would continue.

In January 2001, the new chair of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation called for an audit of Sound Transit&#x27;s finances to be conducted by the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation before allowing for further federal grants on the light rail project. A private audit commissioned by Sound Transit determined that the agency&#x27;s financial estimates had been &quot;overly optimistic&quot;, lacked adequate contingencies, and were drawn from insufficient data. Eight different citizens&#x27; groups called for various solutions to replace or dissolve the agency; among them were a new referendum, replacement of light rail with the planned city monorail network, or a fare-free bus system endorsed by two former Washington governors. CEO Bob White resigned and was replaced by Joni Earl, previously chief operating officer; she is credited with salvaging the light rail project and restoring public trust in Sound Transit. Earl, an accountant who had little transit experience but was a city manager and deputy county executive under Drewel, sought to make the agency more transparent and produce a more realistic budget for its projects.

The inspector general&#x27;s interim report, released in April 2001, criticized the FTA and Sound Transit for advancing in the grant review process without having a firm cost estimate, which had changed several times due to modifications to the preferred project. It recommended that federal funding for the project be withheld; new Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta then announced a hold on releasing funds from the federal earmark, which would not be redistributed while Sound Transit resubmitted its plans. The editorial board of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; published a call to pull the plug on the Link light rail project, while the cost overruns drew negative comparisons to the Big Dig project in Boston. The city&#x27;s other daily newspaper, the &quot;Post-Intelligencer&quot;, alleged that the Sound Move budget had concealed $350million in contingency funds (equivalent to $ in dollars) to reduce the estimated cost of light rail, similar to a criminal case of securities fraud uncovered in the Big Dig megaproject. After Sound Transit officials presented their evidence to the &quot;P-I&quot; editorial team, the story was retracted and a correction was published on the front page.

A shortened, version of the Central Link project between Tukwila and Downtown Seattle was proposed as the initial operating segment for the network; it would cost $2.1billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct under the revised budget estimates but would not reach Sea–Tac Airport. The revised plan, with a completion date set for 2009, was approved by the Sound Transit Board in September 2001 and formally adopted two months later by a 14–2 vote. The change in the project&#x27;s scope from the original Sound Move plan was challenged in a lawsuit filed in February 2002 by an opposition group funded by Kemper Freeman; a county court ruled in favor of Sound Transit and the decision was later upheld by the State Supreme Court. A new grant application for the project&#x27;s federal funding was submitted in July 2002 and final design began the following month with the FTA&#x27;s approval. The inspector general&#x27;s second investigation of Sound Transit took ten months and was completed in July 2003; the report concluded that the agency had resolved its financial auditing issues and outstanding questions about rail–bus interoperability in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, among other issues. The full federal grant agreement was reinstated in October 2003 and construction of Central Link began a month later.

===Service expansion and ST2 plans===
The first section of the Link light rail system to be constructed was Tacoma Link (now the TLine), a local streetcar that connects Tacoma Dome Station to Downtown Tacoma. The line opened on August 22, 2003, and cost $80.4million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct over a three-year period. A second commuter rail line for Sounder, the North Line (now the NLine), began service on December 21, 2003, and extended the network north from Seattle to Edmonds and Everett. Earlier that month, Sound Transit signed a 97-year lease of the track rights with BNSF for $258million (equivalent to $ in dollars); the agreement also included acquisition of the Lakeview Subdivision for an extension of the South Line to Lakewood.

Sound Transit began forming its long-range plan in 2004, which would include a new funding package for the remainder of Central Link as well as other projects to expand the rail and bus network. A total of 81 projects were included in the adopted plan, including near-term light rail extensions to the Eastside via Interstate 90, north to Lynnwood, and south to Tacoma. The northern tunneled section of the original Central Link route was divided into two new projects in 2005: University Link from Downtown Seattle to Capitol Hill and the Montlake area; and North Link (later Northgate Link) from Montlake to the University District and Northgate. The routing for University Link avoided the Portage Bay crossing but also eliminated a station on First Hill, which had been deemed a risk to securing federal funding. To serve the neighborhood, Sound Transit offered to include the First Hill Streetcar project in its next transit package.

The second phase of the regional transit plan, a 20-year program named Sound Transit 2 (ST2), was adopted by the Sound Transit Board in May 2007. It would cost $10.8billion in 2006 dollars (equivalent to $ in dollars) and include of light rail expansion, the First Hill Streetcar, and planning for further expansions to be built with outside funding. ST2 was one component of the joint Roads and Transit ballot measure, which also included $7billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) in highway and road projects proposed by the Regional Transportation Investment District (RTID), which included areas in the three counties beyond the Sound Transit district. The RTID had previously proposed a joint ballot measure for the November 2004; a 2006 bill passed by the state legislature required both issues to be on the same ballot, but allowed them to run separately. The joint package—the largest tax proposal in the state&#x27;s history—was opposed by Kemper Freeman on financial grounds and the local Sierra Club chapter for its road expansions; the proposal also found little support among major political figures and opposition from some, including King County Executive and former Sound Transit Board chair Ron Sims. On November 6, 2007, the Roads and Transit package (officially Proposition 1) was rejected by 56percent of voters in the three-county region; a post-election survey commissioned by Sound Transit found that most respondents were uncertain of the package&#x27;s costs and tax impacts or were opposed to the high cost. In response to the failure of Roads and Transit, a bill to expand Sound Transit into a regional transportation agency that was also responsible for highway development was proposed in the state legislature but died in the 2008 session.

A standalone ballot measure for ST2 was proposed for the 2008 or 2010 elections, the latter after the scheduled completion of Central Link in Seattle. Ridership on Sound Transit services grew by 25percent from July 2007 to July 2008 amid a national increase in transit ridership driven by higher gasoline prices. The increase in ridership and favorable political environment led to a push to prepare the ST2 ballot measure for the November 2008 election, which was expected to have greater turnout due to the concurrent presidential election. In July, the Sound Transit Board voted to place a 15-year version of the ST2 package on the November ballot; its cost was reduced to $17.9billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) and would require a 0.5percent sales tax increase. The plan included of light rail extensions that would reach Lynnwood, the Microsoft campus in Redmond, and northern Federal Way by 2023. It also retained the First Hill Streetcar and funded additional Sounder and Sound Transit Express service in the near-term to address crowding. On November 4, 2008, Proposition 1 (which authorized the ST2 plan) was approved by 58percent of voters despite the ongoing economic crisis. The &quot;pro&quot; campaign raised nearly $1million in funds (equivalent to $ in dollars) over a four-month period and used targeted campaigning to improve turnout among young voters.

===Link opening and early ST2 projects===

The initial of Central Link (now the 1Line) opened to passengers on July 18, 2009, between Westlake station in Downtown Seattle to the north and Tukwila International Boulevard station to the south. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which underwent a two-year renovation to prepare for light rail service, became the only tunnel in the U.S. to have stations shared between buses and trains. The construction cost was $117million (equivalent to $ in dollars) below the $2.44billion budget (equivalent to $ in dollars) set by Sound Transit in 2003. An extension from Tukwila to Sea–Tac Airport opened on December 19 and cost $244million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars)—financed primarily through bonds. By September 2009, Sound Transit&#x27;s services had carried over 100million total passengers, of which 82million were on its network of 26 express bus routes on 21 corridors. The ORCA card, a smart card system for seven of the region&#x27;s transit agencies, debuted in April 2009 and replaced Sound Transit&#x27;s paper transfer tickets and PugetPass monthly passes on January 1, 2010.

The first service expansion using ST2 funds was rolled out beginning in May 2009, with additional trips for twelve bus routes and a ninth daily round-trip on the Sounder SouthLine. Sound Transit&#x27;s primary revenue sources, sales tax and the motor vehicle excise tax, began to decline in late 2008 as a result of the ongoing economic recession. By late 2010, the agency expected that it would have a shortfall of $3.9billion (equivalent to $ in dollars) through the lifetime of the ST2 program, approximately 25percent of forecasted revenue. In response, several Sounder projects and a portion of the light rail extension to Federal Way were cut from the ST2 program or given a lower priority rating, as was preliminary engineering for other projects. The start of University Link construction was unaffected by the cuts, as it had already been budgeted and received federal funding, while planning for the Eastside&#x27;s light rail extension stalled over disagreements over the routing in Bellevue. Ridership on Sounder and Sound Transit Express declined slightly from 2009 to 2010, while Link light rail fell short of its projections; weekend and late-night trips on Central Link were also reduced to one railcar to save on operating costs.

To cover increased operating costs, Sound Transit Express fares were increased twice over a two-year period and several routes or sections with low weekend ridership were cut or combined in June 2011. The agency also opened new bus hubs in Kirkland and Mountlake Terrace, where a freeway station was constructed in the median of Interstate 5. The first infill rail station constructed by Sound Transit, at Commerce Street on Tacoma Link, opened in September of that year. The Sounder SouthLine was extended from Tacoma to Lakewood on October 8, 2012, at a cost of $325million (equivalent to $ in dollars) and completed the original commuter rail network from the 1996 plan. The Lakewood extension used the northern section of the Point Defiance Bypass, a corridor owned by Sound Transit and designated for use by intercity Amtrak trains. It was rebuilt at a cost of $181million (equivalent to $ in dollars), primarily funded by the state and federal governments. On December 18, 2017, the first Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; trip on the new corridor derailed on a bridge over Interstate 5 near DuPont; three passengers were killed and dozens of people were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the causes of derailment to be the lack of positive train control and a hazardous curve that was not replaced due to budget issues; Sound Transit was criticized for not mitigating for both issues, while WSDOT and Amtrak were blamed for inadequate training through the curve. Amtrak service on the corridor resumed in November 2021 following the activation of positive train control and speed reductions.

Ridership on the agency&#x27;s services reached a new record high in 2012, with 28million total boardings and an average of 93,000 passengers on weekdays. Sound Transit began construction of the Northgate Link Extension, which was deferred from Sound Move and funded by ST2, in August 2012. The agency extended Sound Transit Express service outside of its district into Olympia in 2013 as part of a four-year pilot project funded by Intercity Transit, the local transit operator in Thurston County. The route of the Eastside light rail line, under the project name East Link, was approved in April 2013 alongside additional funding from the Bellevue city government to cover the costs of a downtown tunnel. The line would use the Interstate 90 express lanes on the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and become the first permanent railway on a floating bridge; design tests were conducted using a two-car trainset on a model of the proposed transitions between the bridge&#x27;s fixed and floating spans. An elevated extension of Central Link from Sea–Tac Airport to South 200th Street station (now Angle Lake) also began construction in April 2013; it was the first design–build project for the agency and was funded by ST2 and federal grants to accelerate planning by four years from the rest of the deferred Federal Way Link Extension. In 2015, Sound Transit introduced its first double-decker buses to increase capacity on the Seattle–Everett corridor and other Snohomish County routes operated by Community Transit, which already had its own double-decker fleet.

Central Link service was extended to Capitol Hill and the University of Washington campus on March 19, 2016, via a tunnel that cost $1.9billion to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars) and was completed six month ahead of schedule. The southern extension to Angle Lake station opened on September 24 and was completed at a cost of $343million (equivalent to $ in dollars), below its original budget. The First Hill Streetcar, funded by Sound Transit and built as part of the Seattle Streetcar network, opened two months earlier after a delay due in manufacturing streetcars with electric batteries. By late 2016, Light rail ridership reached a daily average of 66,203 weekday passengers—an increase of 89percent from late 2015—and necessitated the use of four-car trainsets. The agency carried 47million total passengers across all of its modes in 2017, with growth in its rail services and a slight decline in express buses. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel was fully transitioned to light rail use in March 2019 following the closure of the northern bus entrance; the tunnel&#x27;s ownership was transferred to Sound Transit in October 2022 after the agency completed $87million in debt payments to King County Metro.

===Sound Transit 3===
The ST2 package included funds to produce studies on future transit projects for a potential third expansion package that would be known as Sound Transit 3 (ST3). Studies of alternatives were launched in 2013 for several corridors, including a joint study with the Seattle Department of Transportation for the Downtown Seattle–Ballard corridor. Sound Transit proposed a $15billion package to fund a pool of projects that were identified in an updated long-range plan adopted in December 2014, including deferred projects from Sound Move and ST2. In July 2015, the state legislature approved a transportation spending package that included the agency&#x27;s request to authorize a new set of taxes—including a property tax—pending voter approval of ST3 in the November 2016 election.

Long-time Sound Transit CEO Joni Earl went on medical leave in April 2014 following a brain injury and was replaced in the interim while a national search for a replacement was conducted. Former FTA administrator Peter Rogoff was hired as the agency&#x27;s new CEO in January 2016, while Earl was retained as CEO emeritus until the March opening of University Link, when she originally planned to retire. The initial list of 70 candidate projects for ST3 was reduced to a priority list for the draft of the plan, which was released in March 2016. The draft plan proposed a 25-year program that would open new transit projects from 2028 to 2041 that would include all modes and ultimately extend Link light rail to a network from Everett to Tacoma. It was estimated to cost a total of $50billion over its lifetime, consisting of $27billion in new tax revenue alongside federal bonds and existing taxes and bonds.

The final ST3 plan was approved by the Sound Transit Board in June 2016 following several changes from the draft plan, including the addition of $4billion in bond capacity to accelerate the timeline for some projects and bring the total package to $53.8billion. It included the addition of to Link light rail with a network stretching to Everett in the north, Issaquah to the east, and Tacoma to the south; a bus rapid transit network on Interstate 405 and State Route 522; and capacity improvements to the Sounder SouthLine with an extension to DuPont. On November 8, 2016, the ST3 ballot measure was approved by 54percent of voters in the three-county district; it passed with a majority in King and Snohomish counties, but not in Pierce County. An attempt to restrict the motor vehicle excise tax collected for ST3 to $30 was launched by Tim Eyman and passed in 2019 as Initiative 976, which was later ruled unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court.

In September 2019, Sound Transit announced plans to rename its services to use colors in preparation for the launch of more Link light rail lines; the existing Central Link would become the Red Line, while Tacoma Link became the Orange Line and East Link would become the Blue Line when it opened. The agency withdrew this plan after criticism from political groups for the use of the name &quot;Red Line&quot;, which ran through areas where redlining had been historically practiced. A new naming system based on numbers was announced in April 2020, with Central Link instead being renamed the 1Line. The first ST3 projects to begin construction were the Downtown Redmond extension to East Link and the Federal Way Link Extension, which both were mostly deferred but had preliminary engineering funded by ST2. In 2020, Link became the first light rail system in the U.S. to run entirely on renewable energy after Sound Transit enrolled in a direct purchase program for wind power from Puget Sound Energy to supplement its hydroelectricity from Seattle City Light.

===COVID-19 pandemic and ST2 openings===

The local onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 led to a 67percent decline in Sound Transit ridership by mid-March after remote work policies were enacted by major employers in the Seattle area. The agency halted its fare collection and enforcement for several months and reduced service in response to the decline in ridership and lack of available staff during the beginning of state-mandated lockdown measures. In April, Link service was reduced to a frequency of every 20minutes, several Sounder trips were suspended, and some Sound Transit Express routes were temporarily cancelled; by the following month, total ridership on the agency&#x27;s services had declined 85percent to an average of 21,000 weekday passengers. Sound Transit also suspended most of its work on active construction projects until May due to the inability to meet public health guidelines on social distancing. Normal frequencies on Link were restored in June 2021 along with some Sound Transit Express routes, while others remained suspended through 2022 due to a shortage of bus drivers.

Light rail service on the 1Line in Seattle was extended north by three stations from the University District to Northgate on October 2, 2021. The majority of the extension is tunneled and the $1.9billion construction cost was funded by ST2. The new stations drove an increase in Link ridership above its pre-pandemic figures, reaching over 80,000 daily boardings by 2023, despite the slower recovery for ridership at downtown stations. The system also set several one-day ridership records in July 2023 due to special events in Seattle, reaching 136,800passengers on July 23. Tacoma Link, now renamed the TLine, doubled in length to over with the opening of an extension to the Stadium District and Hilltop neighborhoods on September 16, 2023. The project was delayed by a year and cost $65million more than its original ST2 budget due to issues with relocating underground utilities during construction.

The 2Line, formerly named East Link, was originally scheduled to open from Seattle to western Redmond in 2023, but was delayed a year by construction issues and a four-month strike by concrete delivery drivers. The $3.7billion project is the most expensive section of the ST2 package and had already been delayed three years due to disputes during its planning process. The opening of the line was split into two phases to allow for the completed section between South Bellevue and Redmond Technology stations to be used by passengers. The initial section between Bellevue and Redmond opened on April 27, 2024. The western section of the 2Line, which uses the Interstate 90 floating bridge, is scheduled to open in late 2025 after the rebuilding of 5,455 concrete plinths under the rails. The 1Line was extended from Northgate into Snohomish County on August 30, 2024, with the opening of four stations in Shoreline, Mountlake Terrace, and Lynnwood. The opening of the Lynnwood Link Extension increased daily ridership on the 1Line to an average of 90,000 on weekdays in November despite reliability issues that led to major service disruptions by the end of 2024.

==Organization==

===Management===

The Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority is a public corporation and special-purpose district that operates under the name Sound Transit. It was established under the authority of the Washington State Legislature and is governed by Revised Code of Washington chapters 81.104 and 81.112. , the agency has 1,585 full-time employees and is led by a chief executive officer (CEO) who oversees several departments. Since 2024, the interim CEO of Sound Transit has been Goran Sparrman, the former head of the Bellevue Department of Transportation and a vice president of HNTB. The previous CEO, Julie Timm, was hired in 2022 and previously the head of the Greater Richmond Transit Company in Virginia. Her predecessor was Peter Rogoff, the former Federal Transit Administrator from 2009 to 2014. Rogoff was hired in 2015 and succeeded Joni Earl, a former city administrator who became Sound Transit CEO in 2001.

The agency has three oversight committees that are filled by citizens from the Sound Transit district. The Citizen Oversight Panel oversees compliance with board policies and financial plans, and is composed of 15 members serving four-year terms after their appointment by the board of directors. The Diversity Oversight Committee promotes employment and contracting opportunities for underprivileged groups and includes members representing community organizations and business organizations. The Citizens Accessibility Advisory Committee has 15 members who represent passengers with disabilities, mobility issues, or are senior citizens. The advisory committee monitors the agency&#x27;s compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other accessibility requirements.

===Board of directors===
Sound Transit is governed by a board of directors with 18 members who are appointed based on their positions in regional and local governments. One seat is held by the Washington State Secretary of Transportation, while the remaining seventeen are local elected positions appointed by the county executives of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties, with approval of the respective county councils. The only fixed positions among these appointments are the county executives themselves and representatives from the largest city in each of the three counties; other positions are filled by representatives from other cities or unincorporated areas. Major decisions, including annexations, system plans, and the annual budget, require a two-thirds majority of boardmembers.

The board has ten members from King County, four from Pierce County, and three from Snohomish County. The seats were allocated proportional to their population within the Sound Transit district in 1994, with each seat representing approximately 145,000 people at the time. Sound Transit is authorized to expand its board to up to 25 members and adjust the allocation between the counties based on the results of the decennial census. A bill to require board seats to be directly elected from within 11 districts was passed by the Washington State Senate in 2017 but was not considered by the House Transportation Committee. In 2019, Sound Transit added a seat for a labor liaison that is recommended by labor organizations and appointed to a four-year term.

The agency&#x27;s policies are set by the board through their decisions, including maintenance of the long-range plan, budget, and project details. The full board meets at the Ruth Fisher Board Room in Union Station on the fourth Thursday of the month; their meetings are open to the public and streamed online. The board selects a chair and two vice chairs to serve two-year terms and also assign members to four committees: the Executive Committee, Rider Experience and Operations, System Expansion, and Finance and Audit. In the event that the chair or vice chairs leave office or are otherwise unable to serve their full term, the vacancy can be filled by another member for the remainder of the term.

===Funding===

Sound Transit&#x27;s budget is primarily funded through local taxes levied within the regional transit district in the urbanized portions of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. These taxes, which comprise 63percent of the total 2017–2046 budget, are composed of a 1.4percent sales tax, a 0.8percent motor vehicle excise tax, a 0.8percent rental car tax, and a property tax of up to 25cents per $1,000 in assessed value. The property tax rate is variable and can increase at a rate of up to 1percent annually with approval from the agency&#x27;s board of directors. The remaining 37percent includes grants and bonds from the federal government, loans, interests, and passenger fares. In 2023, Sound Transit accounted for 57.7percent of all local tax revenue collected by transit agencies in Washington state. That year, the agency earned $51.9million from passenger fares—of which 62 percent was from Link light rail. The farebox recovery ratio for Link was 16percent in 2023, followed by 10percent for Sound Transit Express and 8percent for Sounder.

The agency has had three major ballot measures that were approved by voters to fund system expansion: Sound Move (1996), Sound Transit 2 (2008), and Sound Transit 3 (2016). Planning and construction of new transit projects is anticipated to continue until 2046 under the Sound Transit 3 plan and are forecast to cost $148billion in year-of-expenditure dollars. Under a provision of the state constitution, Sound Transit is limited to issuing debt that does not exceed 1.5percent of the assessed land value within the district; the final bond payments under the program are scheduled for 2068. Approximately 51percent of the long-range budget is allocated towards capital construction, while operations and maintenance comprise up 27percent. The 2024 budget has $3.1billion in expenses and $2.9billion in expected revenue; it includes $638million for operations and $2.2billion for capital projects.

===District and subareas===

The regional transit district for Sound Transit, also known as the &quot;RTA district&quot;, encompasses major cities and urban areas in portions of King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. It covers and includes 53 cities with a combined population of 3.39million residents—40percent of the state&#x27;s population. , the district includes approximately 89percent of King County residents, 85percent of Pierce County residents, and 59percent of Snohomish County residents.

The district&#x27;s boundary to the west is Puget Sound from DuPont and the Thurston County line in the south to Everett and the Snohomish River to the north. The eastern boundary generally follows the edge of the contiguous suburbs in the three-county region. It excludes several large suburban cities, such as Marysville in Snohomish County and Covington and Maple Valley in southern King County. The district is mandated by state law to include the highest-population urban growth areas in the three counties and must be adjusted to include all of a member city, including annexed areas. New areas can be annexed to the RTA district through a ballot proposition following approval from Sound Transit and consultation with affected transit agencies and governments.

For funding purposes, the Sound Transit district is divided into five subareas: Snohomish, North King, South King, East King, and Pierce. Revenue from taxes are allocated towards projects that serve and benefit residents within the subarea that they were collected in, with costs shared for projects and services that serve multiple areas. Systemwide projects and programs pool their funds from all subareas. The most-populous subarea is North King, which has an estimated 853,980 residents () and encompasses Seattle, Shoreline, and Lake Forest Park; the smallest is South King, which has an estimated 487,685 residents ().

===Policing and security===
Sound Transit contracts with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for police services, which includes patrolling transit facilities, monitoring traffic, and responding to emergency incidents. The transit police unit of the Sheriff&#x27;s Office was created in 2008 to prepare for the launch of light rail service in Seattle. , the transit police has 65 officers out of 89 total positions. These positions are overseen by a chief and include an operation captain, patrol sergeants, officers, detectives, a crime analyst, and a explosive detection specialist with a police dog. These deputies wear Sound Transit uniforms and drive patrol cars marked with the agency&#x27;s logo; a bicycling unit with seven members was created in 2024.

In addition to armed officers, Sound Transit has 550 uniformed security officers who are contracted from four private firms. The unarmed security officers patrol transit facilities and respond to incidents from a central dispatch center, but are not allowed to intervene in assaults. The security officers also conducted fare enforcement on Link light rail and Sounder commuter trains, which included a citation with a $124 fine for non-paying passengers, until the program was suspended in 2020 due to accusations of discrimination. They were replaced in 2023 by fare ambassadors who conduct checks of all riders and issue warnings in lieu of citations. In the first months of the new program, 48,000 warnings were issued and the fare compliance rate had risen from an estimated 55percent in 2023 to 84percent in May 2024.

Other uniformed staff include station agents at Sounder commuter rail stations, who provide customer service and assist passengers with disabilities; staff ambassadors for rider education and reporting; and event staff who provide customer service during special events and planned service disruptions.

==Facilities and programs==

Sound Transit is headquartered at Union Station, a former intercity train terminal in the Chinatown–International District neighborhood of Seattle. The agency moved into the building on November 1, 1999, after it was acquired and renovated at a cost of $23.5million. The station&#x27;s former waiting room is open to the public and was named the Joni Earl Great Hall in 2017 for the agency&#x27;s former CEO. Since 2009, Sound Transit has also occupied leased space in four buildings around Union Station, which is adjacent to King Street Station and the International District/Chinatown transit hub.

The system serves over 90 regional transit facilities, including 59 light rail and commuter rail stations. These include stations with park and ride lots and garages that regularly fill on weekdays; a daily fee is planned to be implemented in 2025 to manage demand at busy lots. Link light rail trains are maintained at three operations and maintenance facilities in Seattle, Bellevue, and Tacoma. The primary maintenance facilities for Sounder commuter rail and the Sound Transit Express bus network are leased or shared with their respective operators.

Sound Transit is one of seven transit agencies that accept fare payment through the ORCA card system, which allows for inter-agency transfers. It launched in 2009 and is administered by Sound Transit. The original system was replaced with a second-generation platform in 2022 that is planned to have support for other forms of contactless payment, including credit cards and mobile payment apps. , 79percent of Sound Transit fares were paid using an ORCA card; in May 2024, the system served over 431,000 customers in the Puget Sound region across all operators.

===Transit-oriented development===
Several major transit-oriented development (TOD) projects were constructed around Sound Transit facilities in the 2010s and 2020s after zoning changes were approved by local governments. Among the largest projects is the Spring District, a mixed-use neighborhood in Bellevue on the 2Line that began construction in 2013. Sound Transit&#x27;s first TOD project, Senior City at Federal Way Transit Center, opened in 2010 and includes 61 units of affordable housing for senior citizens. It was developed as a public–private partnership with the nonprofit Korean Women&#x27;s Association on surplus land adjacent to the transit center. The Seattle Housing Authority redeveloped its Rainier Vista public housing complex into a mixed-income neighborhood after the nearby Columbia City station opened in 2009.

Beginning in 2015, new state legislation required Sound Transit to offer its surplus property from major construction projects to developers who would prioritize affordable housing. The &quot;80–80–80 rule&quot; in the legislation, later adopted by the agency in 2018, applied to 80 percent of surplus land around transit projects and required that developments designate 80 percent of residential units to residents who make 80 percent or less of the area median income. , Sound Transit&#x27;s TOD program had resulted in the creation of over 2,670 affordable housing units out of 3,470 constructed at 14 stations with a total value of $1.7billion. Some of the developments also include community amenities, such as childcare facilities, medical clinics, and job-training centers.

===Technology===

All Sound Transit buses and trains are equipped with GPS tracking units to monitor their positions. The information is publicly available through an open data system and published under the GTFS standard used by navigation programs and apps. The backend servers for the OneBusAway app, originally developed by a University of Washington student in 2008, were acquired by Sound Transit in 2013. The app continues to be maintained by volunteers. In 2016, a phased rollout of cellular service in the Link light rail tunnels began. Since 2024, Sound Transit has offered 3D maps of select 1Line stations for accessible wayfinding through the GoodMaps app. The maps were developed through LiDAR scans and include real-time directions through the use of a phone camera.

===Artwork===

The public art program for Sound Transit, named STart, was established in 1998 to allocate one percent of the local construction budget for artwork. By 2022, the agency&#x27;s collection of artwork had grown to 170 permanent pieces—including murals, paintings, and large sculptures. STart expenditures were estimated at $54million from 1998 to 2023. The program also includes temporary commissions for fences that surround construction sites. Sound Transit sponsors buskers to perform music at its light rail stations in Seattle and donated space at Angle Lake station for an all-ages music venue in 2023.

==Future projects==

By 2026, Sound Transit plans to open the remaining and four stations of the 2Line—the western extension from South Bellevue to Downtown Seattle and the eastern extension into Downtown Redmond. The 2Line will then become an interlined service with the 1Line to Lynnwood, allowing for frequency to double on the corridor north of Seattle. The combined lines will serve an estimated 120,000 to 143,000 daily passengers when fully open. The Federal Way Link Extension is scheduled to open in 2026 and will extend the 1Line south by from Angle Lake to Federal Way with two intermediate stations. The design–build project was delayed two years by the need to construct an unplanned bridge over weak soil that had been revealed by a landslide during slope stabilization work. An infill station in north Seattle at Northeast 130th Street is also scheduled to open in 2026.

The ST3 program, scheduled to last until 2046, includes of new light rail extensions with 37 stations, of additional commuter rail tracks, a bus rapid transit system, and improvements to existing facilities. The bus rapid transit system, named Stride, will have three lines that replace existing Sound Transit Express routes when they launch in 2027 and 2028. It will use the first battery electric buses in the Sound Transit fleet, including double-decker buses with wireless charging. The timeline for the Link extensions was pushed back in a 2021 realignment of ST3 projects in response to a $6.5billion shortfall in forecast revenue due to revenue lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. Long timelines in selecting and approving route alignments and stations have also led to further delays for major ST3 projects, such as the Ballard and West Seattle extensions in Seattle. By 2041, the Link light rail system is planned to span a total of with five lines and 83 stations that serve a projected 750,000 daily passengers on weekdays. The full network will encompass across all modes.

<doc id="846521" wikidata="Q7520734" url="?curid=846521" title="Simple Plastic Airplane Design">
<text>Simple Plastic Airplane Design (SPAD) is a type of radio controlled model airplane.

The R.C. aircraft is usually, though not always, built with the body consisting of a lightweight plastic material such as PVC gutter downspout or an aluminium rail. The wings are made of an equally light material such as foam or coroplast. The remaining components added to the plane are virtually the same as can be found in any other R.C. aircraft of similar size.

This concept of building simple radio controlled airplanes using cheap materials without the time-consuming and painstaking process of working with balsa wood and iron-on plastic coating was popularized by a web site created in the late 1990s, spadtothebone.net. While this web site, and the many original plans and articles still exist, the main gathering place for Spad enthusiasts on the web today resides at rcgroups.. R/C Report magazine author Frank Costa covered Spads from April 2003 to July 2004.

SPADs are preferred to other materials because they are cheaper and are easy to work with, painting is not required, the plastic can optionally be decorated with vinyl sheets which are available in any signboard making shop at very cheap price. The hinges for the control surfaces can be made by sheering one of the twinwalls of the plastic sheet and no special hinging device is required.

SPAD Modelers use corrugated plastic sheets of various thickness, such as 2 millimeter (like the flying wings or electric gliders for which 2mm sheet are preferred) and 4 millimeter. These sheets are generally used by signboard makers and many times, when these sheets are discarded, the modelers have a choice to use them to build model airplanes.

The choice of propulsion can be either internal combustion engine or electric motors as with balsa counterparts.

Corrugated plastic planes are simpler alternative to the traditional balsa wood based R.C. aircraft for a variety of situations. Most of the SPAD airplanes do not use balsa which saves considerable cost. They withstand crashes better than balsa counterparts because of their resilience and hence are a good choice for beginners. Good trainer planes and gliders can be made from SPADs. SPAD modelers make equally good advanced planes that can be made with corrugated plastic. They include: RC Airplane Combat, 3D Flying, and are preferred in places where the flyers would normally not risk a more expensive plane and yet want the same flying characteristics of balsa planes.

For making a SPAD plane, the modeler (usually a beginner) can copy the dimensions of a well known balsa trainer and makes the SPAD plane using the same dimensions and adapting to the building techniques of a SPAD plane. The plane can also be built from plans or can be scratch built (usually, the modeler draws his/her own plans and makes the plane, though this is mostly attempted by experienced modelers)

<text>The (IHA) is an agency of the government of Japan in charge of state matters concerning the Imperial Family, and the keeping of the Privy Seal and State Seal of Japan. From around the 8th century AD until the Second World War, it was known as the .

The Agency is unique among conventional government agencies and ministries in that it does not directly report to the Prime Minister at the cabinet level, nor is it affected by legislation that establishes it as an Independent Administrative Institution.

==Organization and functions==
The Imperial Household Agency is headed by its director-general, assisted by the deputy director, appointed by the Cabinet. Its main organizational positions are:

* the Grand Steward&#x27;s Secretariat
* the Board of Chamberlains
* the Crown Prince&#x27;s Household
* the Board of Ceremonies
* the Archives and Mausolea Department
* the Maintenance and Works Department
* the Kyoto Office

The current Director-General is .

The Agency&#x27;s headquarters is located in the grounds of the Tokyo Imperial Palace. The Agency&#x27;s duties and responsibilities encompass the daily activities of the Imperial household, such as state visits, organised events, preservation of traditional culture and administrative functions, amongst other responsibilities. The Agency is responsible for the various Imperial residences located throughout Japan, and organises guided tours for visitors to the Tokyo Imperial Palace, the Kyoto Imperial Palace, the Katsura Detached Palace, and other residences and locations falling under its remit.

The Agency is responsible for the health, security and travel arrangements of the Imperial family, including maintaining the Imperial line. The Board of the Chamberlains, headed by the Grand Chamberlain, manages the daily life of the Emperor and the Empress, and is responsible for keeping the Privy Seal and State Seal of Japan. The Grand Master of the Board of the Crown Prince&#x27;s Household helps manage the schedules, dining menus, and household maintenance of the Crown Prince and his family.

==History==
The Imperial Household Agency traces its origins back to institutions established by the Taihō Code (or more formally, ) promulgated in 701–702 AD. The system established the namesake , a precursor to the present agency; the former code also gave rise to the , which has its legacy in the under the current agency, and the which oversaw the that would now correspond to the Agency&#x27;s . The basic structures remained in place until the Meiji Restoration (1868).

===Meiji period===
The early Meiji government officially installed the on 15 August 1869. Though the names are occasionally differentiated in English as the &quot;Imperial Household Agency&quot;, versus the former, Meiji period &quot;Ministry of the Imperial Household&quot;, both names are rendered with no differentiation in Japanese. However, there is a convoluted history of reorganization around how the government bodies that correspond to constituent subdivisions of the current Agency were formed or empowered during this period.

The and later the (1871–1872) were briefly established, having been placed in charge of, for example, the under the , one of the tasks designated to the Agency today.

Meanwhile, the Meiji government created the in 1871, which was soon renamed in 1872. Also in 1872, the Ministry of Divinities was abolished, with the bulk of duties moved to the and the administration of formal ceremonial functions transferred to the aforementioned Board/Bureau of the Ceremonies.

The Bureau of the Ceremonies was initially placed under the care of the , but was later transferred to the control of the Imperial Household Ministry in September 1877. The Bureau underwent yet another name change to in October 1884. Since then, the name has remained unchanged and is, today, headed by the Master of Ceremonies.

An Imperial Order in 1908 confirmed that the Imperial Household Minister, as the chief official was then called, held responsible for assisting the Emperor in all matters concerning the Imperial House. The ministry also oversaw the official appointments of Imperial Household Artists and commissioned their work.

===Imperial Household Office, 1947–1949===
The , a downgraded version of the ministry, was created pursuant to Law No. 70 of 1947 during the American Occupation of Japan. Its number of staff was downscaled from 6,200 to less than 1,500, and the Office was placed under the Prime Minister of Japan.

===Imperial Household Agency, 1949–present===
In 1949, Imperial Household Office was renamed to the Imperial Household Agency, and placed under the fold of the newly created , as an external agency attached to it. In 2001, the Imperial Household Agency was organizationally re-positioned under the .

==Criticism==
The Agency has been criticized for isolating members of the Imperial Family from the Japanese public, and for insisting on stiffly preserved customs, rather than permitting a more approachable, populist monarchy.

In May 2004, Crown Prince Naruhito criticised the then-Grand Steward of the Imperial Household, , for putting pressure on Crown Princess Masako, &#x27;s wife, to bear a male child. At a press conference, stated that his wife had &quot;completely exhausted herself&quot; trying to adapt to the Imperial family&#x27;s life, and added &quot;there were developments that denied &#x27;s career (up to our marriage) as well as her personality.&quot; It has officially been stated that is suffering from an &quot;adjustment disorder&quot;, but there has been extensive speculation in the press that she is suffering from clinical depression as a result of her treatment by Imperial Household officials.

Increasingly in recent years, the Agency&#x27;s prevention of archaeological research regarding a large number (more than 740) of Kofun Period tombs claimed to be and designated as &quot;Imperial&quot; has come under criticism from academics. The tombs, located in the Kansai region of western Japan, are considered by many academics as potentially holding important historical information on the origins of Japanese civilization; however, the possibility that these potential finds could verify or further solidify theories of formative civilizational ties with contemporary civilizations in China and the Korean Peninsula, with these civilizations potentially having as much influence on the origins of the Imperial Household itself, is generally considered to be a considerable contributing factor to the ongoing prevention of archaeological research at these sites by the Imperial Household Agency, with a large number of the tombs considered by some to be imperial only in name.

==Grand Stewards==
The Imperial Household Agency is headed by the Grand Steward (, Article 8-1), whose appointment or dismissal is subject to the Emperor&#x27;s approval (Article 8-2).

The Grand Steward is vested with comprehensive control over administrative activities within the Agency, and supervisory authority over the service performance of the staff (8–3). He is empowered to interact with the Prime Minister on matters pertaining to the Agency&#x27;s authorized duties, either requesting the issuance of Cabinet Office ordinances (8–3), or notifying him on pertinent matters (8–4). He has the authorization to hand down orders or directives to staff members of government organs under the agency&#x27;s direct control (8–6), and may request the Commissioner General of the National Police Agency to take appropriate measures regarding administrative duties that involve the civilian .

The Grand Stewardship is a post customarily filled by former (≒permanent secretaries) at one of several internal affairs (home affairs) type ministries and agencies, or someone with a closely approximating (e.g., Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department), after having served as Vice-Grand Steward.

<text>Leopold Jessner (3 March 1878 – 13 December 1945) was a noted producer and director of German Expressionist theater and cinema. His first film, &quot;Hintertreppe&quot; (1921), is considered a major turning point which paved the way for the later German Expressionist experiments of German filmmakers F.W. Murnau, Fritz Lang, and G.W. Pabst.

A native of Königsberg, Jessner was a touring actor in his youth and turned to directing in 1911. He was director of the Berlin State Theater from 1919 to 1925 and was known for bare stages in which flights of steps served as different spaces for scenes and directing actors to act in an oversimplified, unnatural manner.

&quot;Hintertreppe&quot; (German for &quot;Backstairs&quot;), Jessner&#x27;s first film (co-directed with Paul Leni), exemplified Jessner&#x27;s use of heavily stylized staircases. These staircases would become regular fixtures in later German films, nicknamed &quot;Jessnertreppe&quot; in Jessner&#x27;s honor, and would be used to full effect in the 1926 German Expressionist film &quot;Faust&quot;, directed by F.W. Murnau. 

As a Jew and a Socialist, he was forced to emigrate to the United States in 1933, after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. He worked in film anonymously in Los Angeles until his death.

<text>Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia is a discontinued general encyclopedia first published in 1949 by P. F. Collier and Son in the United States. With &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica, Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; became one of the three major English-language general encyclopedias. The three were sometimes collectively called &quot;the ABCs&quot;. In 1998, Microsoft acquired the right to use &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; content from Atlas Editions, which had by then absorbed Collier Newfield. Microsoft incorporated &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;&#x27;s content into its &quot;Encarta&quot; digital multimedia encyclopedia, which it marketed until 2009. 

&quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was an entirely new, 20 volume work, with the first volumes available in 1949 and all volumes published by 1951. It had more than 2,000 contributors, included 10,000 black and white illustrations, 96 pages of four-color illustrations, 126 colored maps and 100 black and white line maps. There were more than 400,000 index entries. &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was printed with paper stock of top quality. The end sheets portrayed the development of civilization, and the cover stamping was 22-carat gold, with red panels on black. In 1962, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was expanded to 24 volumes.

&quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia,&quot; updated annually, was especially strong in its coverage of the arts and humanities, social sciences, geography and botany. Most articles in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; were signed, many by prominent scholars. William Terry Couch, Editor-in-Chief during the 1950s, sought to present multiple and varying perspectives on all controversial issues addressed in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; and in its annual &quot;Year Book&quot;. Couch&#x27;s editorial staff included David Crawford, managing editor; Louis Shores, library consultant and advisory editor; Robert H. Blackburn, consultant for Canada; and Joseph T. Gleason, Jr., consultant for schools. 

== History and predecessors ==

Under the leadership of P.F. Collier and Son&#x27;s President, John G. Ryan, sales of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; increased substantially during the 1950s, rising from 46,374 sets in 1953 to 110,688 sets in 1957.

The vast majority of sales of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; were by a door-to-door sales force, and part of a combination sale that included other P.F. Collier and Son publications such as the 50-volume Harvard Classics, The Junior Classics, dictionaries, and atlases. However, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&#x27;s&quot; also enjoyed strong sales to schools and libraries.

Since its 1875 founding, P.F. Collier and Son gave customers the option to pay for books over time. In-home encyclopedia purchasers typically paid for the books in small monthly payments over three years. In an era of heavy smoking, in the 1950s and 1960s, the cost of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was equivalent to the cost of a pack a cigarettes a day. In 1962, the new 24-volume &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was priced at $299.50, payable over 3 years, or at a daily cost of 27 cents. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes that year was also 27 cents. This was an affordable price for middle and low income families.

For many families, owning a set of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; became a status symbol. P.F. Collier and Son had credit qualification standards for purchasers. In the 1950s, one of the qualifiers to determine if a family could afford the books was the presence of a telephone in the household. A company branch manager was required to phone the household to verify the details of each in-home sales order.

&quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; proved highly profitable for P.F. Collier and Son. In 1956, John G. Ryan reported a net profit of 20% on $25 million in sales revenue, an amount that kept P.F. Collier and Son&#x27;s parent company, the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, solvent as it suffered huge losses from its failing magazine business. P.F. Collier and Son&#x27;s profits from sales of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; also funded Crowell Collier&#x27;s expansion into radio stations and its 1960 purchase of the Macmillan publishing company. With his company&#x27;s profits soaring, Ryan directed &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; Editor-in-Chief William Terry Couch and P.F. Collier publications director Everett Fontaine to compile an expanded revision of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; by 1962.

The 24-volume 1962 edition of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; had an imposing list of contributors, embracing authorities from universities, professional societies, government, and industry. The articles were arranged to provide a simple explanation and basic facts followed by more detailed Information. The 1962 edition contained 6,000 new illustrations, many in color, and 1,450 maps, 150 in color. One of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;″s strong features was its bibliography, which provided additional sources for further reading.

Although work on the 1962 edition of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was authorized by P.F. Collier and Son&#x27;s president John Ryan, and initiated by his editorial staff, the completed 1962 work was published by the parent company, Crowell Collier, which had merged with its P.F. Collier and Son subsidiary in December 1960, and assumed its former subsidiary&#x27;s publishing and sales financing activities.

In 1993, a French publisher, Atlas Editions, a subsidiary of the Italian publishing giant De Agostini, acquired &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; from Macmillan Inc., the corporate name which Crowell Collier had assumed subsequent to its purchase and merger with Macmillan. Atlas Editions formed a sister company, Collier Newfield, to market &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot;. In 1997, Collier Newfield developed &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia 1998&quot;, a three-disk CD-ROM multimedia version featuring 17 million words and over 18,000 photos and illustrations, 6 hours of audio, 85 minutes of audio, a dictionary, and maps.

The 1997 24-volume &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; was to be the last print edition. The 1997 print edition extended to 19,900 pages. Bibliographies were found in the last volume, which also contained a 450,000 entry essential index.

In 1998, Microsoft acquired the right to use &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; content from Atlas Editions, which had by then absorbed Collier Newfield. Microsoft incorporated &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&#x27;s&quot; content into its &quot;Encarta&quot; digital multimedia encyclopedia, which it marketed until 2009. Atlas Editions has retained the right to publish &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; in book form, a right that it has never exercised.

== Kister&#x27;s comparison ==
A well-known analysis of major encyclopedias is that of Kenneth Kister, who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; with the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; in 1994. For the &quot;quantitative&quot; analysis, ten articles were selected at random (circumcision, Charles Drew, Galileo, Philip Glass, heart disease, IQ, panda bear, sexual harassment, Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan) and letter grades (A–D, F) were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopedias, the four average grades fell between B− and B+, chiefly because not one encyclopedia had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s. &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; received eight &quot;A&quot;s, and the &quot;Britannica&quot; received one &quot;D&quot; and eight &quot;A&quot;s; thus, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; received an average score of 92% for accuracy to &quot;Americana&quot;&#x27;s 95% and &quot;Britannica&quot;&#x27;s 92%. In the timeliness category, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; averaged an 85% to &quot;Americana&quot;&#x27;s 90% and &quot;Britannica&quot;&#x27;s 86%. After a more thorough &quot;qualitative&quot; comparison of all three encyclopedias, Kister recommended &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; as the best of the three big encyclopedias, primarily on the strength of its writing, presentation and navigation.

<doc id="846548" wikidata="Q305233" url="?curid=846548" title="Takeshi Aono">
<text>was a Japanese voice actor and narrator from Asahikawa, Hokkaidō. He was attached to Aoni Production at the time of his death. He graduated from Hokkaidō Asahikawa Higashi High School.

==Career==
Aono was most known for the roles of Shiro Sanada (Space Battleship Yamato), Rihaku (Fist of the North Star), Nurarihyon (&quot;GeGeGe no Kitaro&quot;), Piccolo Daimao and Kami-sama (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot;), Kumahachi Kumada (&quot;Kiteretsu Daihyakka&quot;), Dakuan (&quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;), Gen Fu (&quot;Dead or Alive&quot;), Dezsaras (&quot;&quot;), Jinpachi Mishima (Demon form) (&quot;Tekken 5/Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection&quot;) and Tomozō Sakura (&quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;). In the live action field, Aono was the official dubbing artist of Joe Pesci and Christopher Lloyd. Aono was also known to appear in the first ten &quot;One Piece&quot; movies. He is also known to gamers as the voice of the diabolical Dr. Wily in the PlayStation-era Mega Man games, and Colonel Roy Campbell of the Metal Gear games. Aono is mostly remembered for his harsh voice for many Japanese anime series.

==Illness and death==
In May 2010, Aono checked into a hospital for an aortic dissection and suffered a stroke shortly thereafter, thus ending his career as a voice actor. His ongoing roles were replaced by other voice actors.

At about 4:38 pm on April 9, 2012, Aono suffered a bout of post-operative multiple cerebral infarctions and was found dead. Voice actress Eiko Hisamura announced Aono&#x27;s death via her Twitter feed, and video game designer Hideo Kojima stated via his Twitter that he will retire the Roy Campbell character from the Metal Gear series out of respect for Aono. Aono was 75 years old at the time of his death.

<text>The Gifford Observatory is an astronomical observation facility located in the suburb of Mount Victoria, Wellington, New Zealand. Operated by the Gifford Observatory Trust with the intent of making it available for use to Wellington school children, it is primarily used by secondary school students, and members of the Wellington Astronomical Society.

== History of the observatory ==
The observatory was first established in 1912 by the efforts of Charles Gifford, a science teacher. The observatory was moved to the current site in 1926, on land that is now occupied in trust by Wellington College and Wellington East Girls&#x27; College. The observatory fell into disrepair in the late 1970s due to a momentary lack of time and enthusiasm from staff and students at the school.

A trust was established in 1998 by a small group of interested teachers and amateur astronomers from the Wellington Astronomical Society, with the goal of restoring the observatory to a working state. On March 25, 2002, the observatory was successfully re-opened by William Pickering, who had been a frequent user of the observatory during his school days.

== Equipment ==
Since being moved to its present location in 1924, the observatory has housed a 130 mm Zeiss refracting telescope. The telescope was equipped with a clockwork drive until it was replaced by a motor drive in the mid-1960s.

The telescope was kept in storage during the observatory&#x27;s disrepair throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was returned to the observatory following the restoration.

<doc id="846554" wikidata="Q787851" url="?curid=846554" title="USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413)">
<text>USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; (DE-413) was a destroyer escort of the United States Navy which served in World War II, the first of three U.S. Navy ships to bear the name.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was named after Coxswain Samuel Booker Roberts Jr., a Navy Cross recipient, who had been commended for voluntarily steering a Higgins boat towards enemy forces at Guadalcanal, in order to divert fire from evacuation efforts being undertaken by other friendly vessels. The ship was nicknamed the &quot;Sammy B&quot;.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was sunk in the Battle off Samar, in which a small force of U.S. warships prevented a superior Imperial Japanese Navy force from attacking the amphibious invasion fleet off the Philippine island of Leyte. The battle formed part of the larger Battle of Leyte Gulf of October 1944. The ship was part of Task Unit 77.4.3 (&quot;Taffy 3&quot;), escort carriers only protected by relatively few destroyers and destroyer escorts. Task Unit 77.4.3 was inadvertently left to fend off a fleet of heavily armed Japanese battleships, cruisers, and destroyers off the island of Samar. 

Steaming through incoming shells, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; scored one torpedo hit and several shell hits on larger enemy warships before she was sunk. After the battle, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; received the appellation &quot;the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship.&quot; As of June 2022, she is the deepest shipwreck ever discovered. Her last known survivor died on 20 March 2022.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was laid down on 6 December 1943, by the Brown Shipbuilding Company of Houston, Texas. She was launched on 20 January 1944, sponsored by the namesake&#x27;s mother, Mrs. Anna Roberts. She was commissioned on 28 April 1944, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland, USNR.

==Service history==
&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; had a shakedown cruise off Bermuda from 21 May to 19 June 1944. After spending time at the Boston Navy Yard, &quot;Roberts&quot; departed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 July. Later that day, the ship presumably struck a whale, which bent her starboard propeller. Repairs were completed by 11 July. &quot;Roberts&quot; departed Norfolk on 22 July, going through the Panama Canal on 27 July. She joined the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 10 August.

She conducted training exercises around the Hawaiian Islands then steamed out on 21 August with a convoy reaching Eniwetok Atoll on 30 August. On 2 September, &quot;Roberts&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, with a convoy arriving on 10 September. Following further training, the destroyer escort got underway on 21 September, escorted a convoy to Eniwetok, and arrived on 30 September.

&quot;Roberts&quot; next proceeded to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands of the Southwest Pacific and then joined Task Unit 77.4.3, nicknamed &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. From there she steamed to Leyte Gulf area off the eastern Philippines. On arrival, she commenced operations with the Northern Air Support Group off the Island of Samar.

===Battle off Samar===
Shortly after dawn on 25 October, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was protecting Taffy 3&#x27;s escort carriers whose aircraft were supporting the Army assault. The warships were steaming off the eastern coast of Samar when the Japanese Center Force, a 23-ship task force under the command of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, appeared on the horizon and opened fire. At 07:35, &quot;Roberts&quot; turned and headed toward the heavy cruiser .

The commanding officer, Copeland, announced &quot;We&#x27;re making a torpedo run. The outcome is doubtful, but we will do our duty.&quot; With smoke as cover, &quot;Roberts&quot; steamed to within of &quot;Chōkai&quot;, coming under fire from the cruiser&#x27;s forward guns.

&quot;Roberts&quot; had moved so close that the Japanese large caliber guns could not depress low enough to hit her and when in torpedo range, &quot;Roberts&quot; launched three Mark 15 torpedoes, with one blowing off &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s stern. &quot;Roberts&quot; fought with the Japanese ships for a further hour, firing more than six hundred shells, and while maneuvering at very close range, hitting &quot;Chōkai&quot;″s superstructure with her 40 mm and 20 mm anti-aircraft guns.

At 08:51, the Japanese landed two hits, the second of which damaged the aft gun. This damaged gun suffered a breech explosion shortly thereafter which killed and wounded several crew members. With her remaining gun, &quot;Roberts&quot; set the bridge of the heavy cruiser on fire and destroyed the Number Three gun turret. &quot;Roberts&quot; was then hit by three shells from the battleship , which tore a hole long and wide in the port side of her aft engine room.

At 09:35, the order was given to abandon ship. She sank 30 minutes later, with 90 of the crew dying. The 120 survivors of the crew clung to three life rafts for 50 hours before being rescued.

During the battle, &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, which was designed for , managed by raising pressure to and diverting all available steam to the ship&#x27;s turbines.

&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 27 November 1944.

The wreck was discovered around 22 June 2022, at a depth of , at that time the deepest wreck ever identified.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; was included in the Presidential Unit Citation given to Task Unit 77.4.3 &quot;for extraordinary heroism in action.&quot; &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; earned one battle star for her World War II service.

Gunner&#x27;s Mate Third Class Paul H. Carr was in charge of Gun Mount 52, the aft gun, which had fired nearly all of its 325 stored rounds in 35 minutes before a round exploded in the gun&#x27;s breech. Carr was found dying at his station from a severe intestinal wound, begging for help to load the last round he was holding into the breech. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded a Silver Star. A guided-missile frigate, , was named for him.

The frigate was named for the ship&#x27;s commanding officer.

==Memorials==
* At the U.S. Naval Academy, in Alumni Hall, a concourse is dedicated to Lieutenant Lloyd Garnett and his shipmates on &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; who earned their ship the reputation as the &quot;destroyer escort that fought like a battleship&quot; in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
* Within Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery federal military cemetery in the city of San Diego, California, there is a large granite memorial dedicated in 1995 to &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;, and to the two U.S. destroyers also sunk in the action, and .

==Successors==
Two later U.S. warships have borne the name USS &quot;Samuel B. Roberts:&quot;

* The second , was a , commissioned in 1946 and struck in 1970.
* The third , is an guided missile frigate, commissioned in 1986 and decommissioned on 22 May 2015.

==Discovery of wreck==
An exploration team led by Victor Vescovo and made up of personnel of Caladan Oceanic, Deep Ocean Search, and EYOS Expeditions discovered the wreck of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; in June 2022. The team found, identified, and surveyed the wreck during a series of six dives conducted from 17 to 24 June 2022.

The team determined that the wreck reached the seabed in one piece, although it hit the sea floor bow first and with enough force to cause some buckling, and observed that the ship&#x27;s stern had separated from the rest of the hull by about . The team reported that it had found evidence of damage to the ship inflicted by a Japanese battleship shell, including &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot;″s fallen mast.

The wreck of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; lies at a depth of , making her the deepest known shipwreck and the deepest shipwreck ever identified by a crewed submersible. It exceeds the previous record of , set in March 2021 when Vescovo&#x27;s team found and identified the wreck of the destroyer , which was sunk in the same battle.

==Sunken ship protection==
The wreck of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; is protected from unauthorized disturbance by the Sunken Military Craft Act. A permit for archaeological, historical, or educational purposes can be requested from the Naval History and Heritage Command.

<doc id="846558" wikidata="Q1360149" url="?curid=846558" title="International Data Group">
<text>International Data Group (IDG, Inc.) is a market intelligence and demand generation company focused on the technology industry. IDG, Inc.&#x27;s mission is centered around supporting the technology industry through research, data, marketing technology, and insights that help create and sustain relationships between businesses.

IDG, Inc. is wholly owned by Blackstone and is led by Genevieve Juillard, who was appointed CEO of the company in 2023. Juillard serves on IDG, Inc.&#x27;s leadership team along with IDC President Crawford Del Prete and IDG, Inc.&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer Tiziana Figliolia.

IDG, Inc. is headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts and is parent company to both International Data Corporation (IDC) and Foundry (formerly IDG Communications).

==History==
International Data Group was initially founded as International Data Corporation (IDC) in 1964 by Patrick Joseph McGovern, shortly after he had graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Based in Massachusetts, the company produced a computer installation database, and published a newsletter, &quot;EDP Industry and Market Report&quot; (modeled on &quot;ADP Newsletter&quot;, which was published by the Diebold Group). Companies such as RCA, Univac, Xerox, and Burroughs paid IDC for use of the data base. During this time, McGovern continued to work as a writer for &quot;Computers and Automation&quot; magazine, the first computer magazine, published by Edmund Berkeley.

=== Publisher History ===
By IDG&#x27;s third year, McGovern was considering liquidating the company when he hit on the idea of launching &quot;Computerworld&quot; in 1967, which was a continuation of the monthly newsletter, published weekly instead of monthly, in a different format, with advertising, and which would become a cornerstone of IDG&#x27;s subsequent publishing arm. 

In 1969, IDG made its first overseas expansion when it opened IDC UK and launched its first European publication. In 1974, the company launched its first international publication, &quot;Computerwoche&quot;, in Germany, its first fully translated publication. International publications in Japan, China, the then Soviet Union, Vietnam, and other countries would follow throughout the 1990s.

In 1984, the company launched &quot;MacWorld&quot; in the same week that the Macintosh computer was debuted, and featured Steve Jobs on its cover. In the 1991, IDG Books launched its &quot;For Dummies&quot; series with &quot;DOS For Dummies&quot;, and published many instructional/reference books under the series until Hungry Minds (the new name for IDG Books) was acquired by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. in 2001.

In 2007, IDG ceased print publication of InfoWorld U.S. and made the content available online only, signaling the company&#x27;s transition to a web-centric model for publication.

=== Events, Research &amp; Technology Marketing ===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, IDG would break into the events and research spaces. In the early 1970s, it launched its &quot;Computer Caravan&quot; trade show in the US, reaching nine US cities in 11 weeks. By 1972, the &quot;Computer Caravan&quot; had a European presence as well.

In the 1980s, IDG launched &quot;IDC Predictions&quot; via its subsidiary IDC, which would come to represent the company&#x27;s technology research and analyst arm. The company still maintains an &quot;IDC Predictions&quot; team of analysts today that publish regular findings on the state of the worldwide technology industry.

In 1991, the first IDG DEMO Conference was held in La Quinta, CA as a live forum where companies could debut their latest technology live on stage in front of crowds of technology consumers, business decision makers, and investors. The event, which would go on to be held as conferences across the US, Asia, South America, and other countries through 2015, served as the site of notable product and software launches such as Adobe Acrobat, PalmPilot, VMware Virtual Hardware, Netscape, and Salesforce.

By the mid-2000s, the company had established a rich online and print publication business, a trusted market research and analyst division, and a large global trade show presence – all which contributed to the growth of a database of over six million technology buyers and professionals. In 2006, IDG made this database of readers, website visitors, and event attendees available to technology marketers via its demand generation division IDG Connect. In 2010, IDG introduced the &quot;Nanosite&quot;, an advertising tool designed as an alternative to a microsite.

=== Changing Ownership ===
Following McGovern&#x27;s death in 2014, ownership of the corporate passed to the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, until 2017 when it was purchased by China Oceanwide Holdings Group. IDG, Inc. changed ownership again in May 2021 when Blackstone Inc. acquired the corporation from China Oceanwide Holdings Group for $1.3 billion.

== Divisions &amp; Brands ==
IDG, Inc. serves as the parent company of two major company divisions, IDC and Foundry.

=== International Data Corporation (IDC) ===
IDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDG, Inc. and is a global provider of market intelligence, advisory services, and events for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets. IDC employs over 2,500 people globally including more than 1,300 analysts worldwide to offer expertise and insights on technology and industry trends.

In 2019, Crawford Del Prete was named president of IDC after serving as its Chief Operating Officer (COO).

In May 2021, IDC acquired Dutch IT intelligence consultancy Metri, bolstering its presence in the Benelux region and strengthening IDC&#x27;s reach and insight into Europe&#x27;s IT industry.

=== Foundry ===
Foundry is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDG, Inc. and is a global provider of media &amp; event services, marketing technology, and intent data for B2B technology marketers. Formerly known as IDG Communications, the IDG Inc. subsidiary company rebranded from IDG Communications to Foundry in February 2022 as part of its strategic transformation from publisher to data and martech company. Foundry employs over 1,400 people globally and operates in over 140 countries around the world.

Between 2020 and 2022, Foundry acquired leading data and marketing technology (MarTech) companies Triblio, Kickfire, Leadsift, and Selling Simplified as part of its strategy to transform from legacy media network to integrated marketing technology and data provider. Through both homegrown and acquired data and technologies, Foundry continues to leverage their established media brands to gather and provide insights about global technology buyers to marketers in the same space.

==== Editorial brands ====
Foundry owns and operates various editorial brands that publish relevant content for technology buyers in both the B2B and consumer spaces across over 90 countries. With some like &quot;Computerworld&quot; and &quot;MacWorld&quot; dating back to McGovern&#x27;s early ownership, the editorial brands remain central to Foundry&#x27;s operations in media and technology marketing, though many of the editorial brands have transitioned from print to digital.

<text>Ludovico (or Lodovico) Carracci (; 21 April 1555 – 13 November 1619) was an Italian, early-Baroque painter, etcher, and printmaker born in Bologna. His works are characterized by a strong mood invoked by broad gestures and flickering light that create spiritual emotion and are credited with reinvigorating Italian art, especially fresco art, which was subsumed with formalistic Mannerism. He died in Bologna in 1619.

==Biography==
Ludovico apprenticed under Prospero Fontana in Bologna and traveled to Florence, Parma, and Venice, before returning to his hometown. Together with his cousins Annibale and Agostino Carracci, Ludovico worked in Bologna on the fresco cycles depicting Histories of &quot;Jason and Medea&quot; (1584) in Palazzo Fava, and the &quot;Histories of Romulus and Remus&quot; (1590-1592) for the Palazzo Magnani. Their individual contributions to these works are unclear, although Annibale, the younger than Ludovico by 5 years had gained fame as the best of the three. This led to Annibale&#x27;s famed commission of the &quot;Loves of the Gods&quot; in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. Agostino joined Annibale there briefly.

While Ludovico remained in Bologna, this does not mean that he was any less influential, the biography of Lanzi states that around 1585, Ludovico and his cousins had founded the so-called Eclectic Academy of painting (also called the Accademia degli Incamminati). More recent conjectures are that there was no established Academy with curriculum, but that Ludovico tutored many in his studio.

This studio however propelled a number of Emilian artists to pre-eminence in Rome and elsewhere, and singularly helped encourage the so-called Bolognese School of the late 16th century, which included Albani, Guercino, Sacchi, Reni, Lanfranco and Domenichino. The Carracci had their apprentices draw studies focused on observation of nature and natural poses, and use a bold scale in drawing figures. Two of Ludovico&#x27;s main pupils were Giacomo Cavedone and Francesco Camullo.

==Restitution ==
In 2009, Carracci&#x27;s painting of &quot;St. Jerome&quot; (c. 1595) was restituted to the heirs of Max Stern, a German Jewish art dealer persecuted and looted by the Nazis

<text>Candoni, officially the Municipality of Candoni (; ; ), formerly known as Tabla Valley, is a municipality in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 23,751 people, making it the least populated municipality in the province.

==Etymology==
Candoni was derived from the native phrase &quot;Kan Dune&quot;, which translates to &quot;belonging to Dune&quot;, a legendary beautiful maiden named Dionesia who committed suicide after being forced by her parents to marry a man she did not love.

==History==
Formerly a barrio of the Municipality of Cauayan, Candoni started as the center of the Tabla Valley Settlement founded in 1935 by Santiago H. Diego, a prominent man from the Municipality of Isabela. He led a group of settlers with a pioneering spirit and prompted by the desire to have a piece of land they could call their own. Pooling their resources and organizing themselves into a cooperative they called Tablenos, the settlers started clearing the valley starting from where the town is now located. They toiled the forests enduring hardships, but many of them died of malaria.

Their efforts were noticed by the Provincial Government who supported them, starting with Gov. Emilio Gaston to Gov. Valenciano Gatuslao, who along with then Speaker Gil Montilla, helped them appeal to President Manuel Roxas in Malacanang for tangible government aid, which came in the form of the road from Dancalan, Ilog to Candoni, following the trail blazed by the Tablenos.

Candoni was finally declared a municipality on August 22, 1958, through Executive Order No. 314 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia. It was inaugurated on August 12, 1961, with Benjamin R. Nava as its first acting mayor.

Recent history of Candoni again showed its people&#x27;s struggle, this time, against the turmoils brought about by the insurgency problem. Fed up with being caught in the crossfire of battles between rebels and government forces, the people of Sitio Cantomanyog in Barangay Haba of the town declared their area as a &quot;Zone of Peace&quot;, the first in the country ever to be declared as such by the residents composed of some 40 families, and this policy is respected by both rebels and government troops.

==Geography==
Candoni is from provincial capital Bacolod and from Sipalay. It is approximately four hour drive from Bacolod City aboard a public utility vehicle and about two hours and 45 minutes on a private car. From Bacolod City, buses are available at Bacolod South Terminal. From Kabankalan City, one can take the public utility jeepneys or buses going to this town. Candoni is the third town with highest elevation in Negros Occidental after Don Salvador Benedicto and San Carlos City.

===Climate===

===Barangays===
Candoni is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

As of 2015, Candoni has a total population of 21,789 and its registered voting population (as of 2015) is 12,449.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Candoni is a fourth class municipality. It is a hinterland town and heavily dependent on agriculture, its main products are sugarcane, rice, corn and coffee. Candoni posted more than 200% rice sufficiency for 2017 and 2018.

===Palm oil plantation project===
In 2009, the DENR awarded a 25 years Integrated Forest Management Agreement to Hacienda Asia Plantation Incorporated, owned by DMCI Holdings, which also owns the Semirara Mining and Power Corporation. HAPI is a joint venture between farmer Alfred Joseph Araneta and Isidro A. Consunji-Luz Consuelo Consunji family&#x27;s Sirawai Plywood and Lumber Corporation. The palm seedlings were imported from Costa Rica, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia. Currently, HAPI has 300 farm workers with P440 daily wage each.

The residents, including the Paghidaet sa Kausawagan Development Group and Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas-Negros contested the legality of the sale of their 6,652-hectare forest land, including 4,000 hectares populated by Indigenous Peoples. They also opposed their ancestral land&#x27;s reclassification for palm tree agriculture. The PHP 2-billion palm oil plantation project straddles in Barangays Gatuslao, Agboy, and Payauan. HAPI&#x27;s heavy equipment destroyed their corn, pineapple, sugarcane, and vegetables plantations. About 1,000 families face eviction, displacement and livelihood disruption amid the LGU&#x27;s offer to create 3,000 new jobs. The Gatuslao Agro-Forestry, Banana and Sugarcane Farmers’ Association announced the filing of Writ of Kalikasan against HAPI to stop the project&#x27;s implementation. Mayor Rey R. Ruiz offered a “win-win” solution in a dialogue with affected 100 farmers.

==Tourism==
Candoni have the following tourism sites:
* Sitio Cantomanyog Zone of Peace, Barangay Haba
* Hinarap Falls, Barangay Agboy
* Pineapple Farm, Barangay Gatuslao
* Twin Cave, Barangay West
* Kennington Hill Nature Park, Brgy West and Gatuslao
* Mount Tahutay, Barangay Caningay
* Shang Spring Resort, Barangay East
* Tigmaya-Paco Road

=== Zone of Peace ===

The Sitio of Cantomanyog in Barangay Haba was the first Zone of Peace in the Philippines. Peace Zone culture is so influential that the people of Cantomanyog were able to produce cultural products therefrom like oral history of Cantomanyog, poetry and music to the extent that it inspired a cluster of communities to do same.

The first skirmish between the NPA and the military happened in Southern Negros in September 1971. With the information that the NPA had a base in the towns of Candoni and Kabankalan, the military immediately sent troops in the said area to hunt down the rebels. The NPA&#x27;s popularity in the hinterlands of Southern Negros, where government was seldom seen and felt, could be explained by its ability to dispense swift, revolutionary justice and maintain order in the community. On April 18, 1989, an undetermined number of NPA guerillas launched a surprise attack on the 7th IB, Alpha Company Detachment at Caningay, Candoni. The Caningay raid was one of the NPA&#x27;s most daring attacks on a military outpost in Candoni.

In 1989, on the island of Negros, because of the inhuman conditions in the evacuation centers, nearly 300 persons - most of them were children - died from malnutrition and measles as the result of the U.S.-organized bombing raid, &quot;Operation Thunderbolt&quot; in the municipalities of Candoni, Hino–baan, Ilog, Cauayan, Kabankalan and Sipalay popularly referred to as the CHICKS area. The people of Cantomanyog began to ask themselves, &quot;Why is this war happening here?&quot;

In November 1989, the Area Core Group leaders of the Gagmay&#x27;ng Kristiyanong Katilingban of Cantomanyog (GKK) or the Basic Ecclesial Community of Cantomanyog (BEC) after their usual panimbahon (community prayer meeting) discussed the peace zone concept. On December 4, 1989, the Basic Christian Community of Cantomanyog gathered for a General assembly wherein a Resolution to Establish the Zone of Peace was read, passed and approved. Their simple declaration was delivered to both the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the New People&#x27;s Army. The NPA and the AFP respected the Zone of Peace.

On February 16, 1990, during a worship service and Eucharist, Natividad Epalan, a community leader holding her two-year-old child, read a statement declaring the village of Cantomanyog to be the first &quot;zone of peace&quot; in the Philippines.

:&quot;&quot;Our village is open to everyone whose intentions are good,&quot; she read. &quot;We wish to be free of the danger of weapons of war and death…Therefore, whoever enters this zone of peace should not bring any guns with them.&quot;&quot;

On 25 May 1993, Senator Rodolfo G. Biazon sponsored a resolution passed by the Senate as Resolution No. 435 urging the Executive Department for the declaration of Cantomanyog and the other six Peace Zones as Special Development Areas. President Ramos, consequently and in cognizance to the Comprehensive Peace Policy, recognized the legitimacy of the said Peace Zones and further declared them as Special Development Areas (SDAs). Each of the seven SDAs was allocated P5,000,000.00 for community development projects through the then National Program for Unification and Development Council now part of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process under the Office of the President.

=== Sit-an Cave ===

Sit-an Cave is a natural marvel that extends about one hundred fifty meters from its entrance to its hindmost part which resembles a church-like cavern with cool natural pool with overflowing water ranging from knee-high to waistline depth that forms an underground stream running along the columns of stalactites that hung like a pendant from its roof.

===Festivals===

The Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival is the annual town fiesta happen every February 7–11 and it is also called Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. The Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival aims to project and manifest the spirit of cooperation exerted by the Tablenos when they trail blazed the wilderness of the Tabla Velley and established the Tabla Valley settlement that became the predecessor of Candoni.

Dinagyaw came from the word &quot;dagyaw&quot; a Hiligaynon term which means a group of people helping each other to perform a specific task.

Aside from the annual town fiesta, Candonians also enjoy from multiple Barangay and community fiestas whole year-round.

==Education==
Candoni has only one school district, District of Candoni. There are 18 public elementary schools, 3 public secondary schools and 1 private secondary school. During the school year 2015–2016, there are 4,335 elementary pupils, 1,271 public high school students and more or less 500 private high school students.
