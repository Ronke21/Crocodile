<text>Gene William Mauch (November 18, 1925 – August 8, 2005) was an American professional baseball player and manager who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers (, ), Pittsburgh Pirates (), Chicago Cubs (–), Boston Braves (–), St. Louis Cardinals () and Boston Red Sox (–).

Mauch was best known for managing four teams from to . He is by far the winningest manager to have never won a league pennant or the World Series (breaking the record formerly held by Jimmy Dykes), three times coming within a single victory of reaching the World Series. Mauch additionally has the most wins of any manager not elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (outside of active managers Terry Francona and Bruce Bochy, and Dusty Baker who retired in 2023 and has not yet appeared on any committee ballots). Mauch managed the Philadelphia Phillies (1960–1968), Montreal Expos (1969–1975 — as their inaugural manager), Minnesota Twins (1976–1980) and California Angels (1981–1982, 1985–1987). His 1,902 career victories ranked 8th in MLB history when he retired, and his 3,942 total games managed ranked 4th. Mauch gained a reputation for playing a distinctive &quot;small ball&quot; style, which emphasized defense, speed, and base-to-base tactics on offense, rather than power hitting.

== Playing career ==
Born in Salina, Kansas, he was raised there and in Los Angeles, where he graduated from John C. Fremont High School. His professional baseball career began in 1943, when he was 17. Reaching the majors the following season during the World War II manpower shortage, Mauch played for six different clubs over all or parts of nine MLB seasons between and . In 304 games and 737 at-bats, Mauch hit .239, with 176 hits, including 25 doubles, seven triples and five home runs. He was credited with 62 RBIs, striking out 82 times. He missed part of 1944 and all of the season while performing wartime service in the United States Army Air Forces.
In 1953, the Milwaukee Braves named Mauch, then 27 years old, the player-manager of their Double-A Atlanta Crackers farm team in the Southern Association, his first managerial assignment. His team finished 84–70, in third place, three games behind the Memphis Chickasaws, and fell in the first round of the playoffs to the eventual league champion Nashville Vols. The combative Mauch was known for frequent skirmishes with the league&#x27;s umpires and he later conceded that he was too young for the assignment. But seven years later, John J. Quinn, who as the Braves&#x27; general manager had hired him for the Crackers&#x27; job, would give Mauch his first big-league managerial opportunity with the 1960 Phillies.

From 1954 to 1957, Mauch was strictly a player, first for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, then the Red Sox. His final big-league season, 1957 with Boston, was his most productive. He started 65 games as the Bosox&#x27; second baseman and batted a career-high .270 with 60 hits. But the following season, he began his managerial career in earnest. In 1958–59, he piloted the Red Sox&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Minneapolis Millers, reaching the Junior World Series as American Association champion each season, and winning the 1958 JWS championship.

During the off-season prior to the campaign, Mauch declined an offer to interview with Quinn for an opening on the Phillies&#x27; coaching staff, saying he wanted to focus on managing. He went to spring training with the Millers and prepared for his third season as their manager. In the final days of spring drills, Quinn called Mauch again and asked him to replace veteran Phillies&#x27; pilot Eddie Sawyer, who had resigned after the team&#x27;s opening game on April 12. Four days later, Mauch—34 years old at time—became the youngest manager in the Major Leagues in 1960.

== Managerial career ==
Mauch was a strong advocate of &quot;small ball&quot;, the emphasis on offensive fundamentals such as bunting, sacrifice plays, and other ways of advancing runners, as opposed to trying to score runs primarily through slugging. His teams generally played in ballparks that were not friendly to home run hitters, which increased the effectiveness of this approach. While his teams occasionally featured power hitters such as Dick Allen, Rusty Staub, and Reggie Jackson, they depended just as heavily on hitters adept at getting on base through contact hitting and patience at the plate, such as Rod Carew and Brian Downing, and on strong defensive play by such stars as Bobby Grich, Bob Boone, and Doug DeCinces. As far as pitchers were concerned, he stressed the importance of changing eye levels, arguing that they should follow up low pitches with high pitches and vice versa in order to confuse the batters.

Renowned as an excellent manager of his bench, Mauch also had a reputation for provoking opposing teams with taunting and of having a strong temperament that stressed himself and his teams excessively in the belief that he could win by sheer will.
Mauch had frequent fiery exchanges with umpires. Mauch was not shy when arguing with an umpiring play. He used his bombastic personality to help his team gain any possible advantage on the baseball diamond. Mauch had a brilliant baseball mind and is sometimes credited with starting the &quot;double player switch&quot;. Mauch gained a reputation for being loyal to his players and became known as the Little General.

=== Philadelphia Phillies ===
Mauch took command of the Phillies two games into the 1960 season. He managed them to a 58–94 record. The following year, they finished 47–107; from July 29 to August 20, they lost 23 straight games, which ranks as the third-longest losing streak in baseball history along with the longest in the 20th century. The following year, they finished 81–80. This was their first season over .500 since 1953. He was named Manager of the Year by the Associated Press that year. &quot;It makes me very happy,&quot; he said of the honor. &quot;The only thing that will make me any happier is when the Phillies are the Team of the Year.&quot; The Phillies improved to an 87–75 record the next season, which was also the first time that the team had two straight winning seasons since 1952-1953. In late September 1964, his Phillies had a record of 90–60, a -game lead in the National League with 12 games left to play, and were starting a 7-game home stand. Mauch decided to start his two pitching aces, Jim Bunning and Chris Short, in 7 of the last 10 games, 4 of those starts on 2 days&#x27; rest (all of which they lost). The Phillies faded, losing 10 games in a row before winning their last 2 games to finish tied for second place with the Cincinnati Reds, one game behind the Johnny Keane&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals in a collapse infamously known as the &quot;Phold.&quot; Ultimately, the season was the peak for the team in terms of wins and finish in his tenure, although Mauch became the first Phillies manager to have three straight winning seasons since Pat Moran from 1915 to 1917. Due to Keane leaving the Cardinals for the New York Yankees after the season, Mauch was selected to manage the 1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which the National League won 6–5. His next three full seasons all resulted in over .500 finishes, though they did not finish above 4th. Mauch was let go after the Phillies were 27–27 during the 1968 season. His 646 wins as manager stood as a team record until 2011, when Charlie Manuel passed him. Mauch still ranks 1st in club history with losses (684).

===Montreal Expos===

In 1969, Mauch became the inaugural manager of the Montreal Expos. In their first season, the team went 52–110. It was his second and last season managing a team with over 100 losses, while finishing in last place in the NL East. While the team finished in last the following year, they went 73–89, a 21-game improvement. Over the next five seasons, the Expos did not finish in last place, managing to win 70 games or more each season, though their best finish was 4th in 1973 and 1974, finishing behind the New York Mets in the former and behind the Pittsburgh Pirates in the latter. On April 23, 1974, the Expos beat the San Francisco Giants to win Mauch&#x27;s 1,000th game as a manager. The Expos won 79 games in both years, though they did not finish above .500. After the team finished 75–87 in 1975, Mauch was fired by the Expos.

===Minnesota Twins===
In 1976, Minnesota Twins owner Calvin Griffith hired Mauch to manage his team, which had Rod Carew at the time. He guided the Twins to an 85–77 that year, good enough for third place in the American League West, five games behind the Kansas City Royals. Despite having just one win less the following season, the Twins finished fourth, this time games behind the Royals. The team plummeted to a 73–89 record in 1978, though they went 82–80 the following year, finishing fourth in both years. Mauch resigned during the following season, with the team at 54–71 (the team would finish at 77–84).

=== California Angels ===
Mauch took over during the strike shortened 1981 season for the California Angels. He went 29–34, while the team overall finished 51–59. In 1982, his Angels team won the American League&#x27;s Western Division after going 93–69. The Angels won the first two games in Anaheim in a best-of-5 ALCS against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Angels needed only one more victory to advance to their first World Series. Chances were great, since no team had ever lost the ALCS after winning the first two games. But Milwaukee came back to win all three remaining games (in Milwaukee) and the AL pennant. Some blamed Mauch, who chose to start Tommy John and Bruce Kison, winners of the first two games, in Games 4 and 5 on three days&#x27; rest each. John thought it was not a bad idea, but he noted that by waiting until after California lost Game 3 to announce the strategy, Mauch made it look like he was panicking. Mauch was replaced by John McNamara before being hired back in 1985.

In Mauch&#x27;s return to managing the Angels in 1985, they finished 90–72, finishing one game behind the Kansas City Royals after being eliminated on the second to last day of the season.

In 1986, the Angels again won the Western title after going 92–70, and led in the fifth game of the (by now best-of-7) ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, just one strike away from the Fall Classic, but Boston&#x27;s Dave Henderson hit a home run off Angels reliever Donnie Moore to put the Red Sox ahead. The Angels tied the game in the bottom of the 9th, but the Red Sox went on to win the game in extra innings as well as the remaining two games in Boston to take the Series, and denied Mauch his last real chance to win a pennant and a World Series championship.

The following year, the Angels went 75–87 along with a 7th-place finish (10 games back of the Minnesota Twins). Mauch suddenly retired for health reasons as manager of the Angels during spring training in at age 62. The team&#x27;s advance scout, Cookie Rojas, who had played for Mauch with the Phillies, took command of the club. Seven years after his retirement as a manager, Mauch returned in 1995 as bench coach with the Kansas City Royals to assist Bob Boone, who was in his first year as a big league skipper.

=== Losing streaks ===
Compounding his ill-starred reputation as a manager, he was the skipper during two of the longest losing streaks in Major League history. His 1961 Phillies lost 23 in a row, one short of the Major League record. His expansion 1969 Expos lost 20 in a row before finally ending it, as Mauch had to endure media reminders of his teams&#x27; previous loss streaks in 1961 and 1964.

===Legacy===
Writing in 1980, fellow manager Alvin Dark called Mauch &quot;the best manager in baseball today&quot;, praising the fact that &quot;he&#x27;s an active manager and a great competitor&quot;. Dark particularly admired Mauch&#x27;s ability to encourage players that were not doing well, or reprimand a star player if necessary. Tommy John noted that he &quot;knew the baseball rule book better than anyone in baseball,&quot; calling him a &quot;brilliant strategist&quot; and &quot;one of the most astute bench managers I ever saw.&quot; However, John also noted that &quot;he never won a pennant because he didn&#x27;t understand pitching.&quot; Mauch thought a pitcher could easily be replaced with a pitching machine.

Mauch ultimately served as a manager in 26 seasons (with 24 as full-time manager), and he had a winning record in twelve of those seasons. On July 27, 1987, he lost his 2,000th game as a manager, becoming the third manager to ever do so (since then, three more managers have joined him). As of the end of the 2023 season, Mauch has the fifth-most losses (2,037) as a manager, while ranking 15th in wins (1,902) and tenth in games managed (3,942).

He managed his nephew Roy Smalley III during his tenure with the Minnesota Twins. Smalley&#x27;s father, Roy Jr., married Mauch&#x27;s sister, Jolene. Roy Jr. and Mauch grew up and played sandlot baseball together in Los Angeles, California.

<doc id="870956" wikidata="Q56877216" url="?curid=870956" title="Broad arrow">
<text>The broad arrow, of which the pheon is a variant, is a stylised representation of a metal arrowhead, comprising a tang and two s meeting at a point. It is a symbol used traditionally in heraldry, most notably in England, and later by the British government to mark government property. It became particularly associated with the Board of Ordnance, and later the War Department and the Ministry of Defence. It was exported to other parts of the British Empire, where it was used in similar official contexts. It is sometimes nicknamed the crows foot.

In heraldry, the arrowhead generally points downwards, whereas in other contexts it more usually points upwards.

==In heraldry==
The broad arrow as a heraldic device comprises a socket tang with two converging blades, or s. When these barbs are engrailed on their inner edges, the device may be termed a &quot;pheon&quot;. Woodward&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign with English and French Glossaries&quot; (1892), makes the following distinction: &quot;A BROAD ARROW and a PHEON are represented similarly, except that the Pheon has its inner edges jagged, or engrailed.&quot; Parker&#x27;s &quot;Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry&quot; (1894) likewise states, &quot;A broad arrow differs somewhat ... and resembles a pheon, except in the omission of the jagged edge on the inside of the barbs.&quot; However, A. C. Fox-Davies, in his &quot;Complete Guide to Heraldry&quot; (1909), comments: &quot;This is not a distinction very stringently adhered to.&quot;

The pheon features prominently in the arms of the Sidney family of Penshurst, and thence in the arms of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and of Hampden–Sydney College, Virginia. Sidney Sussex&#x27;s newsletter for alumni is titled &quot;Pheon&quot;.

==Use for British Government property==


The broad arrow was used in England (and later Britain), apparently from the early 14th century, and more widely from the 16th century, to mark objects purchased from the monarch&#x27;s money, or to indicate government property. It became particularly associated with the Office or Board of Ordnance, the principal duty of which was to supply guns, ammunition, stores and equipment to the King&#x27;s Navy.

===Origins===
The origins of the broad arrow device used by the Board of Ordnance are debated. The symbol is widely supposed to have been derived from the pheon in the arms of the Sidney family, through the influence either of Sir Philip Sidney, who served as Joint Master-General of the Ordnance in 1585–6; or that of his great-nephew, Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney, who served as Master-General from 1693 to 1702. However, as noted by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;this is not supported by the evidence&quot;, as the use of the device predates the association of either Sidney with the Board.

The earliest known use of the symbol in what seems to be an official capacity is in 1330, on the seal used by Richard de la Pole as butler to King Edward III. In 1383, it is recorded that a member of the butlery staff, having selected a pipe of wine for the King&#x27;s use, &quot;signo regio capiti sagitte consimili signavit&quot; (&quot;marked it with the royal sign like an arrowhead&quot;). In 1386, Thomas Stokes was condemned to stand in the pillory by the Court of Aldermen of London for the offence of having impersonated an officer of the royal household, in which role he had commandeered several barrels of ale from brewers, marking them with a symbol referred to as an &quot;arewehead&quot;. The device was also used in the 15th and 16th centuries as an assay mark for pewter and tin.

An alternative theory is that the device used on naval stores and property was in its origins a simplified and corrupted version of an anchor symbol. Thus, a set of &quot;Instructions for marking of Timber for His Majesty&#x27;s Navy&quot; issued in 1609 commands:
===Later use===
A letter sent by Thomas Gresham to the Privy Council in 1554, relating to the shipment of 50 cases of Spanish reals (coins) from Seville to England, explained that each case was &quot;marked with the broad arrow and numbered from 1 to 50&quot;.

A proclamation of Charles I issued in 1627 ordered that tobacco imported to England from non-English plantations should be sealed with &quot;a seale engraven with a broad Arrow and a Portcullice&quot;.

A proclamation issued by Charles II in 1661 ran:
An Order in Council of 1664, relating to the requisitioning of merchant ships for naval use, similarly authorised the Commissioners of the Navy &quot;to put the broad arrow on any ship in the River they had a mind to hire, and fit them out for sea&quot;; while the Embezzlement of Public Stores Act 1697 (9 Will. 3. c. 41) sought to prevent the theft of military and naval property by prohibiting anyone other than official contractors from marking &quot;any Stores of War or Naval Stores whatsoever, with the Marks usually used to and marked upon His Majesties said Warlike and Naval or Ordnance Stores; ... [including] any other Stores with the Broad Arrow by Stamp Brand or otherwise&quot;.

From the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, the broad arrow regularly appeared on military boxes and equipment such as canteens, bayonets and rifles. The prisons built by the Admiralty for the French Revolutionary Wars were equipped with mattresses and other items bearing the broad arrow: at Norman Cross Prison, Huntingdonshire, this was proven effective, when a local tradesman found in possession of items bearing the marks was convicted and sentenced to stand in the pillory and two years in a house of correction. The broad arrow was routinely used on British prison uniforms from about the 1830s onwards.

An instance of the Admiralty using the mark in a salvage case occurred at Wisbech, Isle of Ely in 1860: &quot;The barque &quot;Angelo C&quot;, laden with barley, from Sulina, lying at Mr Morton&#x27;s granary, has been marked with the &#x27;broad arrow&#x27;, a writ at Admiralty having been issued at the instance of Peter Pilkington, one of the pilots of this port, who claims £400 for salvage services alleged to have been rendered to the vessel during the great gale of the 28th ult.&quot;
Topped with a horizontal line, the broad arrow was widely used on Ordnance Survey benchmarks. Broad arrow marks were also used by Commonwealth countries on their ordnance.

The Board of Ordnance was absorbed into the War Department in 1855, but the broad arrow continued to be used by its successor bodies: the War Department 1855–57, the War Office 1857–1964, and by the Ministry of Defence from 1964 onwards, before being phased out in the 1980s.

===Legality===
It is currently a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to reproduce the broad arrow without authority (in the same way as it is an offence to reproduce hallmarks). Section 4 of the Public Stores Act 1875 makes it illegal to use the &quot;broad arrow&quot; on any goods without permission.

===Newspaper===
A newspaper, &quot;The Broad Arrow&quot;, including the broad arrow symbol in its masthead, and described as &quot;A Paper for the Services&quot;, was published from 1833. Its title was later extended to include &quot;The Naval and Military Gazette&quot;. During the First World War it was printed by W. H. Smith &amp; Son. It later became &quot;The Army, Navy and Air Force Gazette: incorporating &quot;The Broad Arrow&quot; and &quot;Naval and Military Gazette&quot;&quot;. In 1936, it merged with the &quot;Naval and Military Record&quot; to form the &quot;United Services Review&quot;.

===Surplus material===
Items deemed no longer serviceable, but still of market value, were stamped again with a second broad arrow, nose-to-nose with the first, to mark them as legally &quot;sold out of service&quot;.

==In the American colonies==

The broad arrow was used by the British to mark trees (one species of which was the eastern white pine) intended for ship building use in North America during colonial times. Three axe strikes, resembling an arrowhead and shaft, were marked on large mast-grade trees. Use of the broad arrow mark commenced in earnest in 1691 with the Massachusetts Charter, which contained a Mast Preservation Clause specifying, in part:

Initially England imported its mast trees from the Baltic states, but it was an expensive, lengthy and politically treacherous proposition. Much of British naval policy at the time revolved around keeping the trade route to the Baltics open. With Baltic timber becoming less appealing to use, the Admiralty&#x27;s eye turned towards the Colonies. Colonists paid little attention to the Charter&#x27;s Mast Preservation Clause, and tree harvesting increased with disregard for broad arrow protected trees. However, as Baltic imports decreased, the British timber trade increasingly depended on North American trees, and enforcement of broad arrow policies increased. Persons appointed to the position of Surveyor-General of His Majesty&#x27;s Woods were responsible for selecting, marking and recording trees as well as policing and enforcing the unlicensed cutting of protected trees. This process was open to abuse, and the British monopoly was very unpopular with colonists. Part of the reason was that many protected trees were on either town-owned or privately owned lands.

Colonists could only sell mast trees to the British, but were substantially underpaid for the lumber. Even though it was illegal for the colonists to sell to enemies of the crown, both the French and the Spanish were in the market for mast trees as well and would pay a much better price. Acts of Parliament in 1711, 1722 and 1772 (Timber for the Navy Act 1772) extended protection finally to trees and resulted in the Pine Tree Riot that same year. This was one of the first acts of rebellion by the American colonists leading to the American Revolution in 1775, and a flag bearing a white pine is said to have been flown at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

==In Australia==
The broad arrow was used to denote government property in the Australian colonies from the earliest times of settlement until well after federation. William Oswald Hodgkinson&#x27;s government-sponsored North-West Expedition in Queensland used the broad arrow to mark trees along the expedition&#x27;s route. The broad arrow mark was also used on survey markers. It can still be seen on some Australian military property. The broad arrow brand is also still used to mark trees as the property of the Crown, and is protected against unauthorised use.

In Victoria, Australia for example, Part 4 of the Forests (Licences and Permits) Regulations 2009 states that &quot;an authorised officer may use the broad arrow brand ... to mark trees in a timber harvesting area which are not to be felled; or to indicate forest produce which has been seized under the Act; or to indicate that forest produce lawfully cut or obtained is not to be removed until the brand is obliterated with the crown brand by any authorised officer.&quot; The broad arrow is used currently by the Australian Army to denote property owned by the Department of Defence.

The mark was not widely used for convict clothing in Australia during the early period of transportation, as government-issued uniforms were rare. The Board of Ordnance took over supply in the 1820s, and uniforms from this period onwards were generally marked with the broad arrow, including so-called &quot;magpie&quot; uniforms. In an account published in 1827, Peter Miller Cunningham described Australian convicts as wearing &quot;white woollen Paramatta frocks and trowsers, or grey and yellow jackets with duck overalls, (the different styles of dress denoting the oldness or newness of their arrival,) all daubed over with broad arrows, P.B.s, C.B.s, and various numerals in black, white, and red&quot;. In 1859, Caroline Leakey, writing under the pen-name &quot;Oliné Keese&quot;, published a fictionalised account of the convict experience entitled &quot;The Broad Arrow: Being Passages from the History of Maida Gwynnham, a Lifer&quot;.

==In India==
The device was used in Colonial India, and continues to be used in modern India on military vehicle registration plates, although the symbol now employed is a standard typographical upward-pointing arrow rather than a true broad arrow.

==In characterisation of internal combustion engines==
Multi-cylinder internal combustion engines have their cylinder banks arranged in different ways. If there are just two, they may be in-line, opposed or at an angle, the latter often described as a Vee (or V) arrangement. When there are more than two cylinders, they are either arranged radially, in-line or in in-line groups. Thus a V-6 engine has two banks of three cylinders at an angle driving a common crankshaft, a V-12 two groups of six in-line.

Broad arrow or W engines have three groups, one vertical and the two others symmetrically angled at less than 90° on either side. Both the air-cooled Anzani 3-cylinder fan engines of the &quot;pioneer era&quot; of aviation, and the later, &quot;Golden Age of Aviation&quot;-era British Napier Lion 12-cylinder, triple-bank liquid-cooled inline aviation engine could be said to have this layout when seen from a &quot;nose-on&quot; view.

<doc id="870957" wikidata="Q2289288" url="?curid=870957" title="Single-track road">
<text>A single-track road or one-lane road is a road that permits two-way travel but is not wide enough in most places to allow vehicles to pass one another (although sometimes two compact cars can pass). This kind of road is common in rural areas across the United Kingdom and elsewhere. To accommodate two-way traffic, many single-track roads, especially those officially designated as such, are provided with passing places (United Kingdom) or pullouts or turnouts (United States), or simply wide spots in the road, which may be scarcely longer than a typical car using the road. The distance between passing places varies considerably, depending on the terrain and the volume of traffic on the road. The railway equivalents of passing places are passing loops.

==In Scotland==

The term is widely used in Scotland, particularly the Highlands, to describe such roads. Passing places are generally marked with a diamond-shaped white sign with the words &quot;passing place&quot; on it. New signs tend to be square rather than diamond-shaped, as diamond signs are also used for instructions to tram drivers in cities. On some roads, especially in Argyll and Bute, passing places are marked with black-and-white-striped posts. Signs remind drivers of slower vehicles to pull over into a passing place (or opposite it, if it is on the opposite side of the road) to let following vehicles pass, and most drivers oblige. The same system is found very occasionally in rural England and Wales, as well as Sai Kung District in the New Territories. Sometimes two small vehicles can pass one another at a place other than a designated passing place.

Some A-class and B-class roads in the Highlands are still single-track, although many sections have been widened for the sake of faster travel. In 2009, the A830 &quot;Road to the Isles&quot; and A851 on the Isle of Skye have had their single-track sections replaced with higher-quality single-carriageway road.

==In mountains==

In remote backcountry areas around the world, particularly in mountains, many roads are single-track and unmarked. These include many U.S. Forest Service and logging roads in the United States. In Peru, the second of two overland transportation routes between Cuzco and Madre de Dios Region, a 300 km heavy-truck route, is a single-track road of gravel and dirt.

When practical, it is usually considered better for the vehicle going downhill to yield the right of way by stopping at a wide spot. The reason seems to be that it may be harder for the vehicle going up to get started again. At least in California, it is also the vehicle going downhill that must back up, if it is too late to stop at a wide spot.

== Types ==

=== Chicanes ===
Chicanes are often placed on residential streets as a more aesthetic means to slow down cars.

=== One-lane passages ===
Sometimes, for budget reasons, and where traffic is fairly low, bridges exist as single-track corridors. Tunnels in remote areas can also be one lane when the tunnel is short and traffic is low, when building a hill or blasting away the mountain is too cost-prohibitive.

=== One-way single-track roads ===
Single-track roads also exist as one-way stretches. Exit and entrance ramps for freeways and motorways are among common examples of one-way single-track roads.

=== Private single-track roads ===
The most common example of private single-track roads are long driveways of rural properties such as country houses and farm property.

=== Ice roads ===
The mountain passes on the Dalton Highway in Alaska have a rule where goods-carrying northbound truck traffic has the right of way, while returning southbound traffic has to stop, as mentioned on &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;. The reason behind this procedure is that traffic going north is in somewhat of a hurry to deliver equipment to Deadhorse, Prudhoe Bay, and the drill site over the frozen Arctic Ocean.

=== Temporary one-lane restrictions ===
When reconstruction is being done on two-lane highways where traffic is moderately heavy, a worker will often stand at each end of the construction zone, holding a sign with &quot;SLOW&quot; or &quot;GO&quot; written on one side and &quot;STOP&quot; on the reverse. The workers, who communicate through yelling, hand gestures, or radio, will periodically reverse their signs to allow time for traffic to flow in each direction. A modification of this for roadways that have heavier traffic volumes is to maintain one direction on the existing roadway, and detour the other, thus not requiring the use of flaggers. An example of this is the M-89 reconstruction project in Plainwell, Michigan, where westbound traffic is detoured via county roads around town.

== User etiquette ==

If lines of sight are long, and both drivers are familiar with the road, vehicles heading towards each other can adjust their speed so as to arrive at a wide spot at the same time and pass slowly, avoiding the need for either vehicle to stop.

When two vehicles meet head-on, generally the drivers confer to decide in which direction lies the closest wide spot, and together they travel there, the lead vehicle necessarily in reverse gear.

In the Scottish Highlands, most drivers are accustomed to single-track roads. When opposing traffic is encountered, the first driver to reach the nearest passing place pulls over, no matter which side, and flashes the headlights to signal the other car to proceed forward. It is customary for both drivers then to acknowledge each other with a wave as they pass. At night, both drivers acknowledge each other by flashing their off-side direction indicators headlights immediately before or as they pass. It is extremely dangerous to flash headlights at close proximity on narrow unlit country roads at night, as this affects drivers&#x27; night vision.

Usually when there is a brief one-lane bottleneck in a two-lane road, which may happen in many areas, traffic will usually give way to oncoming traffic already in the bottleneck. One-lane single-track roads usually have no conflict.

In the United States, if the situation permits, both vehicles will pull off the road slightly and pass in this manner. Although saving time, this process can cause ruts and erosion along the edge of the road. For this reason, single track roads are generally used in places with very low traffic volumes, though one-lane stop-gap measures will have a sign that says &quot;STOP&quot; on one side of the sign and &quot;SLOW&quot; on the other side of the sign, which construction workers flip.

If there are no passing places or wide parts of the road then the start of the road is considered as the passing place.

<text>Helier (died 555) was a 6th-century ascetic hermit. He is the patron saint of Jersey in the Channel Islands, and in particular of the town and parish of Saint Helier, the island&#x27;s capital. He is also invoked as a healing saint for diseases of the skin and eyes.

== Legend ==
=== Early years ===
Hellerius or Helier was born to pagan parents in Tongeren (now in Belgium). His father was Sigebert, a nobleman from Tongeren and his mother was Lusigard. Having had difficulties conceiving a child, they turned to a Christian teacher named Cunibert, who advised them to pray to God and that when they had a child they must hand him over to God, and that he, Cunibert, would bring him up in the Christian faith. Their prayers having been answered, Helier was born, but Helier&#x27;s father, the Frankish governor of that place, eventually grew angry at the influence Cunibert exerted over his precocious son, who was already causing consternation with his youthful miracles. Helier&#x27;s father had Cunibert killed, whereupon Helier fled.

Helier&#x27;s wanderings led him to the Cotentin where he sought retreat from the distractions of the world in the monastic community of Marculf at Nantus (Nanteuil, now St.-Marcouf-de-l&#x27;Isle in Manche).

=== Jersey ===


Helier, however, found the monastic community did not provide the quiet he required to devote himself fully to a life of contemplation. Marculf had received pleas from the few inhabitants of the island called Gersut, or Agna, now called Jersey, which was all but depopulated due to repeated attacks by Vikings. The inhabitants requested someone to help them, and bring the gospel to them as they had no shepherd to guide them.

Marculf sent Helier and a companion, Romard, to Jersey where he found a small community of fishermen on the sand dunes where the modern town of St Helier was to develop. Helier settled on a tidal islet, nowadays known as the Hermitage Rock, next to L&#x27;Islet, the tidal island now occupied by the 16th century Elizabeth Castle. Romard would travel back and forth between the hermitage on this rock and the fishing village.

From his vantage point on his rock, Helier could see the sails of approaching attackers and would signal to the shore, whereupon the inhabitants would scatter into the surrounding marshes, thereby frustrating the attackers&#x27; bloodlust. Small dark clouds on the horizon are still known in Jèrriais as &quot;les vailes dé St. Hélyi&quot; (the sails of St. Helier).

Helier remained at his hermitage in fasting and prayer for about fifteen years. The story is that around 555 he was martyred by marauding pirates who beheaded him with an axe – hence the crossed axes on the parish crest.

=== Miracles ===
Helier is recorded as performing one healing miracle in Jersey, curing a lame man named Anquetil.

Once while Marculf was visiting, a band of raiders arrived. They prayed and made the sign of the cross and a great storm arose that destroyed the raiders ships. 

Though Helier starved himself to ascetic weakness, legend holds that he had the strength, when he was beheaded by attackers, to pick up his head and walk to shore. According to the hagiography, Romard discovered Helier&#x27;s body on the beach still clutching his head in his hands, placed it in a boat and set off for the mainland. The boat, guided by the hand of God, arrived at Bréville-sur-Mer where a reputedly miraculous healing spring arose on the spot where Helier&#x27;s body rested overnight. A church was founded next to the spring, which is now topped by a statue and still attracts those seeking a cure.

== Veneration ==


Marculf founded an abbey on L&#x27;Islet not far from Helier&#x27;s hermitage and named it for his pupil. It was later visited by Samson of Dol.

Churches dedicated to Helier can be found in Rennes, St. Helier, Beuzeville (Eure), Amécourt (Eure), Barentin (Seine-Maritime), Monhoudou (Sarthe). Evidence of veneration of the saint can be found in La Hague in the Cotentin at Querqueville and also at Omonville-la-Rogue where a 13th-century mural in the church of St. John the Baptist links Helier with Thomas Becket.

Helier is remembered in Jersey for having brought Christianity to the island, but is better known in Normandy and Brittany as a healing saint. Besides the healing springs at St. Hellier and Bréville, there is also a healing spring at Saint-Jouan-des-Guérets (Ille-et-Vilaine), where Helier&#x27;s name has been deformed by folk etymology to &quot;St. Délier&quot; (&quot;délier&quot; meaning to untie in French, which may refer to the power to loosen the bonds of illness). There is also a chapel of St. Helier in the cathedral of Trenton, New Jersey.

The traditional year of his martyrdom is AD 555. His feast day, marked in Jersey by an annual municipal and ecumenical pilgrimage to the Hermitage, is on July 16. The Hermitage is depicted on the Jersey 2 pence coin and on the 2010 issue Jersey £10 note.

In 1870 Hermitage Rock was joined to L&#x27;Islet (Elizabeth Castle) by a breakwater.

=== Relics ===
Helier&#x27;s relics were sent to the abbey of Bellus-Beccus at Beaubec-la-Rosière (Seine-Maritime)) where they remained until the destruction of the abbey during the French Revolution.

==Commentary==
The &quot;Life of Saint Helier&quot; was written in, or after the 10th century.

G.R. Balleine was critical of the Passion of St. Helier, noting that &quot;its chronology is absurd. St. Helier was born, we are told, &#x27;after the death of wicked Queen Brunehild, when Childebert governed the Francs&#x27;. This must be Childebert III, who came to the throne in 693. But Helier became a disciple of St. Marculf, who died in 558; and &#x27;according to one account he was buried by the famous eighth century Bishop Willebrod.&#x27; In other words he was baptised 150 years before he was born, and buried, while still a young man, two hundred years later.&quot; 

Charles Grosset notes that the Passion of St. Helier, written in the 10th or 11th century, draws upon two very much earlier lives of Marculf (A and B), and amends them to suit the narrative.
Grosset&#x27;s conclusion is that the life of Helier is extremely poorly documented, and like Balleine, he considers it largely fictional. He sees the writer as having &quot;been given the task of writing a life of the hermit Helier, who lived in Jersey and has a few bare facts known about him: the cave where he lived, healing of the sick, and death at the hands of pirates. He discovered a similar sounding name to Helier in the district of Tongres, and also a hermit called Eletus in the Life of St. Marcouf. He did not hesitate to identify Helier with the near namesake in Tongres, or to make an identification with Eletus, taking the story of a miracle set on an island whose place-name was not to be found on the map.&quot;

According to A.M. Bellows, the oldest Life of St. Marculf mentions an island called Agna with only thirty inhabitants and a hermit called Eletus. This has been identified with Jersey and Helier, but this is largely a reading back into the story the identifications made in the Passion of St. Helier, a much later work. In Bellows&#x27;s opinion that Jersey could have so few inhabitants (thirty) at the time compared to Guernsey, in the much better documented visits of Sampson, stretches credulity too far. If a Channel Island is chosen, one the size of Herm would be more suitable.

That there was a town given the name &quot;St. Helier&quot; is not by itself proof that Helier existed, or, if he did exist, visited Jersey. The original attribution might have been to Hilary of Poitiers, and became corrupted over time, particularly during the Dark Ages, when the Diocese of Dol was laid waste by invasions of pagans. However, the hermitage rock and linked Priory on the Islet of Elizabeth Castle have a long history. There would certainly seem to be enough evidence to support the idea of a hermit, and later, an eremitic community which gradually evolved.

Further, the Passion of St. Helier was written at a much later date, when the original attributions had been masked by time; it is clearly a work which draws upon any available sources of other saints for stories, and it is this Life that makes the identification of Marculf&#x27;s Eletus with Helier.

<text>The World Athletics Indoor Championships are a biennial indoor track and field competition served as the global championship for that version of the sport. Organised by the World Athletics, the competition was inaugurated as the &quot;World Indoor Games&quot; in 1985 in Paris, France and were subsequently renamed to IAAF World Indoor Championships in 1987. The current name was adapted with the name change of the sports governing body in 2019.

They have been held every two years except for when they were held in consecutive years 2003 and 2004 to facilitate the need for them to be held in alternate years to the main World Athletics Championships (outdoors) in the future. The Championships due to be held in China in 2020 were postponed because of the COVID pandemic, as were the attempted running of the meetings in both 2021 and 2023. In the meantime, two standard editions of the Championships were held at other sites in 2022 and 2024.

Therefore, an &#x27;extra&#x27; edition, between the normal even-year cycle, will be held in Nanjing, China in early 2025, before reverting to the normal cycle in 2026.

==Events==
The events held have been composed of a regular disciplines, with the main alterations coming in the earlier years. The 4 x 400 m relay race for both men and women was added to the full schedule in 1991 with the women&#x27;s triple jump, the latter as an exhibition event, and gaining full status at the following championships.

Racewalking events were dropped after 1993, and a 1600 m medley relay was tried but was discontinued were due to alleged poor interest. This same year, a men&#x27;s heptathlon and women&#x27;s pentathlon were successfully introduced as non-championship events, and have remained on the program since.

In 1997 the women&#x27;s pole vault entered the fray, two years before it made an appearance at the event&#x27;s outdoor counterpart.

Despite the event&#x27;s popularity, the 200 m was removed from the program after the 2004 championships, as the event was deemed unfair to all participants and too predictable, with the tighter bends of an indoor track causing any athletes not drawn in either of the outside lanes having minimal or no chance of winning.

<text> (German for &#x27;emergency money&#x27; or &#x27;necessity money&#x27;) is money issued by an institution in a time of economic or political crisis. The issuing institution is usually one without official sanction from the central government. This usually occurs when not enough state-produced money is available from the central bank. In particular, generally refers to money produced in Germany and Austria during World War I and the Interwar period. Issuing institutions could be a town&#x27;s savings banks, municipalities and private or state-owned firms. Nearly all issues contained an expiry date, after which time they were invalid. Issues without dates ordinarily had an expiry announced in a newspaper or at the place of issuance.

 was mainly issued in the form of (paper) banknotes. Sometimes other forms were also used: coins, leather, silk, linen, wood, postage stamps, aluminium foil, coal, and porcelain; there are also reports of elemental sulfur being used, as well as all sorts of re-used paper and carton material (e.g. playing cards). These pieces made from playing cards are extremely rare and are known as , the German word for &#x27;playing cards&#x27;.

 was a mutually-accepted means of payment in a particular region or locality, but notes could travel widely. Some cases of could better be defined as scrip, which were essentially coupons redeemable only at specific businesses. However, the immense volume of issues produced by innumerable municipalities, firms, businesses, and individuals across Germany blurred the definition. Collectors tend to categorize by region or era rather than issuing authority (see below). is different from occupation money (e.g. Japanese invasion money) that is issued by an occupying army during a war.

==Germany==
Dr Arnold Keller, historian and orientalist, classified German into different periods. Keller edited a magazine called during the &quot;collector phase&quot; of issuance. He compiled a series of catalogs in the years afterward. Although incomplete in many cases, his work formed the foundations of the hobby.

=== in World War I===

 was released even before Germany entered World War I. On 31 July 1914 three notes were issued by the of Bremen (a brewery). This was due to hoarding of coins by the population in the days before war was declared. The first period of continued until the end of 1914, but mostly ceased once the German made up for the shortage with issues of small denomination paper notes and coins of cheaper metal.

As the war dragged on, acute monetary shortages could not be met by the German central bank, leading to a new period of beginning in 1916. Additionally, the non-precious metals used to mint lower value coins were needed to produce war supplies. Dr Keller arranged this period into two catalogs: for issues of less than 1 Mark face value and for values 1 Mark and higher. This period of issue came to a close in 1919.

===World War I prison camp money===
Although camp money used by prisoners of war was different from , collectors inevitably lumped this material into the hobby. The period covered the entire war, 1914–1918. This field of collecting may include World War II issues, though this covers only notes circulated in concentration camps, as the German in charge of prisoners of war prepared a general issue of notes for all camps under their direction.

===Collector series===

Though the production of was initially amateurish, with many set by typewriter or even handwritten, collectors soon appeared on the scene to take hold of the expired 1914 stock. With the next wave of issues in the latter half of the war, production was handled by professional printers. These issues incorporated pleasing designs, and a new reason for hoarding came into being.

As the issuing bodies realized this demand, they began to issue notes in 1920, well after their economic necessity had ended. They may have been motivated by the success of Austrian collector earlier in the year (see below). Notes were issued predominantly in 1921 and were usually extremely colorful. These depicted many subjects, such as local buildings, local scenery and folklore, as well as politics. Many were released in series of 6, 8, or more notes of the same denomination, and tell a short story, with often whimsical illustrations. Often, they were sold to collectors in special envelope packets printed with a description of the series.

Keller published information on releases in his magazine . Often, he used his publication to criticize issuers for charging collectors more money for the series than their face value.

These collector-only sets, which were never intended to circulate, were known as (pieces issued as a part of a series). Quite often, the validity period of the note had already expired when the was issued. As such, they are usually found in uncirculated condition, and are most favored by collectors all over the world.

===1922 and 1923: Hyperinflation===

In 1922, due to uncontrolled printing of money, inflation started to get out of control in Germany, culminating in hyperinflation. Throughout the year, the value of the mark deteriorated faster and faster, and new money was issued in higher and higher denominations. The could not cope with the logistics of providing all these new notes, and was again issued—this time in denominations of hundreds and then thousands of Marks.
By July 1923, the had totally lost control of the economy. flooded the economy; it was issued by any city, town, business, or club that had access to a printing press, in order to meet the ever-increasing rise in prices. Even were being hand-stamped with large denominations to meet the demand. By September, was denominated in the tens of millions; by October, in billions; by November, trillions.

On November 12, the declared the Mark to be valueless, and ceased all issuance. By now, was being denominated in the form of commodities or other currencies: wheat, rye, oats, sugar, coal, wood, quantities of natural gas, and kilowatt-hours of electricity. These pieces were known as , or notes of &quot;fixed value&quot;. There were also coins that were made of compressed coal dust. These became quite rare, as most of them were eventually traded with the coal merchant issuer for actual coal and some may have even been burned as fuel.
In January 1924, the fixed the value of the new in gold. One U.S. dollar was now equivalent to 4.2 (or 4.2 trillion old , which were permitted to be exchanged beginning 30 August 1924). Until that date, a few municipalities issued with denominations of 4.2 Mark or multiples or fractions of that. After that date, of regular denominations were briefly issued, until the forbade any further interference in the economy by local authorities.
During the Interwar period, local municipalities and civic groups capitalized on the public memories of by issuing certificates aimed at collectors, to raise funds for various building projects. These &quot;Building Blocks&quot; () tended to be of relatively high face value and issued in very limited numbers.

=== after World War II===
The kept strict control of the economy during World War II, and forbade local authorities from independently meeting money shortages. After Germany&#x27;s defeat, the Allied Military Control issued currencies for each of their respective areas of control, but did not alleviate coin scarcity. The dire situation after the war forced municipalities to once again issue to help the population meet small change needs. Finally, the Currency Reform of June 1948 created the and prohibited issuance of . Apart from commemorative pieces issued sporadically, the era of in Germany came to a close.

==Austria==

===Revolution of 1848===

Austrian municipalities experienced coin shortages during the revolution of 1848, especially in the Czech towns, and therefore many municipalities and industrial concerns issued as a temporary measure. By 1850, the state finances were in such an order as to render them unnecessary, though certain parts of Hungary still experienced shortages as late as 1860, requiring -type issues.

===World War I===
As in Germany, municipalities in Austria-Hungary issued at the beginning of World War I. In most cases, small change scarcity was severest in the industrial Czech towns of Bohemia and Moravia. From the end of the war into 1919, German-speaking towns of the new Czechoslovakia issued notes until the authorities forbade them to do so.

===Prison camp money===

As with Germany, collectors tended to lump Austro-Hungarian prison camp money in with . Most issues date from 1916–1917, with the majority of camps situated in Austria proper, Hungary, and Czech territories.

===Collector series===
In 1920, hundreds of small towns across Upper and Lower Austria, but also many towns in Salzburg, Tyrol, and Styria, issued sets of collectible , usually in three denominations with expiry dates of three months from issuance. Nearly all were printed on thin paper, often in runs () of different colors or shades. Some of these notes actually circulated, but the vast majority entered private collections, and the scheme&#x27;s success in raising funds for destitute town budgets convinced German towns to do the same thing (see above).

After the initial run of regular series, there were numerous releases of &quot;special issues&quot; () featuring different designs and denominations, fanciful overprints, or the same design as the general issues but in expensive metallic inks on different paper types. Many of these special issues were printed in very small quantities in order to charge premiums to collectors. Groups of rural villages issued , even though some had populations of only a few dozen inhabitants.

===Depression-era ===
In a bid to increase economic activity, several depressed municipalities in the Alps regions of Austria experimented with demurrage features in their during the period 1932–1934. As the notes lost value () over time, the idea was to convince holders to spend them quickly, thereby spurring economic activity. Notes had dated spaces for demurrage coupons to be affixed to them, and each one lessened the total value as they were added. The effort was unsuccessful because the scale of the experiment was too small to show any benefit.

==In other countries==
===Ireland (1689–1691)===

The forces of James II minted coins in base metal (copper, brass, pewter) during the Williamite War in Ireland, which were known as gun money, because some of the metal was sourced from melted-down cannon. It was intended that, in the event of James&#x27; victory, the coins could be exchanged for real silver coins. They were also stamped with the month of issue so that soldiers could claim interest on their wages. As James lost the war, that replacement never took place, but the coins were allowed to circulate at much reduced values before the copper coinage was resumed.

===Sweden (1715–1719)===
In Sweden, between 1715 and 1719, 42 million coins with the nominal value 1 silver were manufactured, but made in copper, with a much smaller metal value. All silver coins were collected by the government, which replaced them with the copper coins. They were called (&#x27;emergency coins&#x27;). This was done to finance the Great Northern War. The government promised to exchange them into the correct value at a future time, a kind of bond made in metal. Only a small part of this value was ever paid.

===Belgium (1914–1918)===

Throughout the German occupation of Belgium during World War I there was a shortage of official coins and banknotes in circulation. As a result, around 600 , local governments and companies issued their own unofficial &quot;necessity money&quot; (, ) to enable the continued functioning of the local economies. These usually took the form of locally produced banknotes, but a few types of coins were also issued in towns and cities. In 2013, the National Bank of Belgium&#x27;s museum digitized its collection of Belgian , which is available online.

===France (1914–1927)===
Between 1914 and 1927, large amounts of were issued in France and its North African colonies during the economic crisis caused by World War I. Among the issuing authorities were companies and local chambers of commerce.

<text>John Rikard Dempsey (born September 13, 1949) is an American former professional baseball player. He played for 24 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball from to , most prominently for the Baltimore Orioles where he played for 10 years and was a member of the 1983 World Series winning team. Dempsey was known for being one of the best defensive catchers of his era. In 1997, he was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.

==Early career==
Dempsey was selected by the Minnesota Twins in the 15th round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft out of Crespi Carmelite High School. He spent two seasons in the minor leagues.

==Major league career==

Dempsey made his major league debut late in the 1969 season for the division winning Twins managed by Billy Martin, however he didn&#x27;t qualify for the postseason roster. Dempsey spent a few more seasons shuttling between the Twins and their minor league teams, before being traded to the New York Yankees for Danny Walton on October 31, 1972.

During his tenure with the Yankees, he served as a reserve catcher to Thurman Munson, and received tutoring from Yankees coach and former catching standout Jim Hegan. He was involved in a fight with teammate Bill Sudakis in the lobby of The Pfister Hotel while the ballclub was checking in on September 29, 1974. It was the culmination of an unpleasant conversation between the two players on a one-hour flight which was delayed for three hours at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The Yankees had swept a four-game series from the Indians and were still in contention for the American League East title with two games remaining in the regular season.

After three and a half seasons with the Yankees, the Baltimore Orioles acquired Dempsey along with Scott McGregor, Tippy Martinez, Rudy May, and Dave Pagan for Ken Holtzman, Doyle Alexander, Elrod Hendricks, Grant Jackson. and Jimmy Freeman at the trade deadline on June 15, 1976. He, McGregor and Martinez became part of a nucleus that kept the Orioles as perennial contender for the next decade.

For the next ten and a half seasons, Dempsey was the Orioles&#x27; starting catcher. He became known for his exceptional ability to handle pitching staffs, his strong throwing arm, and for his agility behind home plate. In 1979, the Orioles defeated the California Angels in the 1979 American League Championship Series to reach the World Series. In the 1979 World Series, the Orioles won three of the first four games against the Pittsburgh Pirates and seemed to be on the verge of winning the championship, when the Pirates, led by Willie Stargell, rebounded to win the final three games. It was one of Dempsey&#x27;s greatest disappointments of his playing career.

In 1983, the Orioles won the American League Eastern Division pennant, then defeated the Chicago White Sox in the 1983 American League Championship Series, before winning the 1983 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dempsey posted a .385 batting average along with a .923 slugging percentage in the five-game series, and won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, one of six catchers to have won the award.

In 1987, Dempsey became a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Cleveland Indians. After only one season with the Indians, he became a free agent once again and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he would be a member of another World Series-winning team in 1988, this time as a backup catcher to Mike Scioscia. When Scioscia was injured during Game 4 of the World Series, Dempsey took over behind the plate for the remainder of the Series, collecting an RBI double in Game 5. While playing for the Dodgers in 1990, he became involved in a brawl with Phillies&#x27; center fielder Lenny Dykstra, who took exception to Dempsey&#x27;s &quot;buttering up&quot; the home plate umpire. Anticipating something happening when Dysktra came closer to him, Dempsey promptly punched him with his catcher&#x27;s glove. He was suspended for one game. After three seasons with the Dodgers, he played one season with the Milwaukee Brewers, before returning to the Baltimore Orioles for his final season in 1992.

His sense of humor during his playing career was renowned, and he was famous for his &quot;rain delay theatre&quot; performances, in which he emerged from the dugout in stockinged feet onto the tarpaulin covering the infield during a rain delay and pantomimed hitting an inside-the-park home run, climaxed by his sliding into home plate on his belly on the wet tarp, all to the raucous delight of the soggy fans. He sometimes did this while wearing a pair of underpants over his uniform, making fun of teammate Jim Palmer&#x27;s famous advertisements for Jockey brand briefs.

==Career statistics==
In a 24-year career, Dempsey played in 1,765 games, accumulating 1,093 hits in 4,692 at bats for a .233 career batting average along with 96 home runs and 471 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .988 fielding percentage. Dempsey led American League catchers twice in fielding percentage, twice in baserunners caught stealing and once in assists. He played more games as a catcher than any other player in Orioles history (1230). During his career, Dempsey caught ten different 20-game winning pitchers. He was a durable player, only going on the disabled list twice in his career. Dempsey fared well offensively in postseason play. In 14 World Series and 11 playoff games, he batted .303 (20-for-66) with 11 runs, 11 doubles, 1 home run, 7 RBI, 1 stolen base and 7 bases on balls.

While he was a light-hitting player, Dempsey&#x27;s lengthy major league career was due in part to his excellent defensive skills, despite the fact that he never won a Gold Glove. He usually did not make a large contribution offensively. During his season with the Brewers, Dempsey made two relief pitching appearances, giving up three hits and one run in two innings pitched. Dempsey also won a Little League World Series in 1963 with the team from Canoga Park-Woodland Hills, California. He is the uncle of former major league catcher Gregg Zaun. Dempsey is one of only 29 players to play in four different calendar decades.

==Coaching and broadcasting career==
After his playing career ended, Dempsey became a minor league manager in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, winning the 1994 Pacific Coast League championship with the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes. He then joined the New York Mets organisation, managing the Norfolk Tides in 1997 and 1998. Dempsey also served as first base coach for the Orioles for several seasons, first as a third base coach in the season after bench coach Sam Perlozzo was promoted to interim manager. He assumed the bullpen coach position in the season, replacing Elrod Hendricks who the team intended to reassign to another position in the organization before his death. Later in 2006, he became the first base coach again when the team reassigned Dave Cash.

Dempsey has been a candidate for managerial openings with the Orioles in the past, as recently as when the Orioles interviewed him for the spot that eventually went to Lee Mazzilli. He was mentioned again as a possible candidate for the Baltimore manager&#x27;s job in 2010, after the firing of Dave Trembley.

Dempsey also served as an Oriole color commentator in 2000 and began another stint in 2007, as the studio analyst for O&#x27;s Xtra on MASN, the cable channel that carries Orioles games. In addition, he serves as a game analyst for occasional games on MASN. In 1985, Dick Enberg was in Toronto for Games 1 and 7 of the 1985 ALCS on NBC. Enberg hosted the pregame show alongside Dempsey (who was still active with Baltimore at the time). In 1995, Dempsey worked as a field reporter for ABC&#x27;s coverage of the All-Star Game from Texas. Dempsey was among those laid off by MASN in 2021.

<text>Marangu is a town located in Moshi District of Kilimanjaro Region. it is divided into Marangu East and Marangu west, each with its own village. It is recognized as one of the main gates for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. it is also famous for being the place where Mangi mkuu (Paramount chief) of the Chagga Thomas Lenana Marreale was born on June 15, 1915.

== History ==
Before Independence in 1961, the town of Marangu used to be the headquarters of the Vunjo district led by Chief (Mangi Mwitori) Petro Itosi Marealle and Paramount Chief (Mangi Mkuu) Thomas Marealle, installed in 1951, who lived in Moshi itself.. The four and half day Marangu Route climb is considered the least arduous. It is believed that the first man in history to have climbed Kibo peak on Kilimanjaro was Kinyala Johannes Lauwo (1871–1996) of Ashira Marangu who allegedly died aged 125 years in May 1996.

== Etymology==
The word &quot;Marangu&quot; means a place with too many water streams. It is one of the most popular places in Tanzania. One of the proverbs of Chagga is &quot;Ulamine kilahu ulyemkiwoa&quot; (not from the Vunjo dialect) which means do not despise something/somebody from which you once received support. it is located 119 kilometers from Arusha city and 39 kilometers from Moshi municipality.

==Economy==
Many Marangu residents are farmers growing bananas, vegetables and coffee. However, the biggest source of income is tourism. The Marangu route is the most popular hiking route in Africa. The town has world class hotels like Babylon Lodge, Kilimanjaro Mountain resort, hosting local and international guests wanting to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. New Marangu residents are young men from all over Tanzania looking to work in the tourism industry as porters and guides.

== Education ==
Marangu is home to The Marangu Teacher Training College and Ashira Girls High School and many other schools which provides education to not only marangu residents but to other residents from different places around Tanzania.

<text>Chief Thomas Lenana Marealle II OBE (June 15, 1915 – February 14, 2007) was the Paramount Chief (Mangi Mkuu) of the Chagga people of Tanzania and a politician.

After winning a paramount chieftainship election, which he ran against Abdi Shangali of Hai, Jackson Kitali of Moshi, Petro Marealle of Vunjo and John Maluma of Rombo, Chief Mareale was inaugurated as chief in January 1952. Thomas Marealle ruled alongside Chief Mangi Mwitori. Petro Itosi Marealle consolidated power from the other 3 Chagga chieftains thus making the Chagga more powerful and in control of their affairs during colonial times. The government abolished the system of chieftainships in 1961, although Marealle, anticipating this, had voluntarily left his post the previous year. His tenure as Mangi Mkuu was regarded as a golden age, marked by major improvements in education, health, the cooperative movement, and communications in his area. In particular his court system and his equitable water allocation system are recalled with great nostalgia.

After working for the United Nations in the field of foreign aid for thirteen years, he retired as a diplomat. He died on 14 February 2007 at the age of 92, and buried at his homeplace in Marangu, Moshi.

<text>Manuel Franquelo (; 1953 – 28 May 2024) was a Spanish painter and mixed media sculptor.

==Biography==
Franquelo was born in Málaga in 1953. He established his reputation as a hyper-realist painter. A common theme in his paintings is a collection of still life objects arranged on a shelf against a dark background.

From the late 1990s Franquelo worked and collaborated with Adam Lowe and engineer Sven Nebel. Lowe and Franquelo created the Factum Arte studio together in 2001, and Franquelo was involved with the studio until 2004. With the support of Factum Arte and Factum Foundation, Franquelo created the Lucida 3D Scanner, used to record three-dimensional images of low-relief surfaces such as those of paintings and frescoed wall surfaces, and still in use by Factum in 2020. Franquelo trained as an electronic engineer, and subsequently produced installations and sculptures often incorporating electronics or computer control.

In 2001, Franquelo and Lowe contributed to a project, along with the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Ahmad Baghat and Michael Mallinson, to demonstrate that it was possible to laser-scan and replicate the tomb of Seti I in the Valley of the Kings. This led to the later recording by Factum Arte and Factum Foundation of the Tomb of Thutmose III, the tomb of Tutankhamun, and the tomb of Seti I.

Franquelo died in Madrid on 28 May 2024, at the age of 71.

<text>Platinum prints, also called &quot;platinotypes&quot;, are photographic prints made by a monochrome printing process involving platinum.

Platinum tones range from warm black, to reddish brown, to expanded mid-tone grays that are unobtainable in silver prints.

Unlike the silver print process, platinum lies on the paper surface, while silver lies in a gelatin or albumen emulsion that coats the paper. As a result, since no gelatin emulsion is used, the final platinum image is absolutely matte with a deposit of platinum (and/or palladium, its sister element which is also used in most platinum photographs) absorbed slightly into the paper.

Platinum prints are the most durable of all photographic processes. The platinum group metals are very stable against chemical reactions that might degrade the print—even more stable than gold. It is estimated that a platinum image, properly made, can last thousands of years. Some of the desirable characteristics of a platinum print include:
* The reflective quality of the print is much more diffuse in nature compared to glossy prints that typically have specular reflections.
* A very delicate, large tonal range.
* Not being coated with gelatin, the prints do not exhibit the tendency to curl.
* The darkest possible tones in the prints are lighter than silver-based prints. Recent studies have attributed this to an optical illusion produced by the gelatin coating on Resin Coated and fiber-based papers. However, platinotypes that have been waxed or varnished will produce images that appear to have greater maximum density than silver prints.
* A decreased susceptibility to deterioration compared to silver-based prints due to the inherent stability of the process and also because they are commonly printed on 100% rag papers.
Many practitioners have abandoned platinum and only use palladium. The process using palladium alone (sodium tetrachloropalladate) is similar to standard processes, but rather than using ferric oxalate plus potassium chlorate as the restrainer (which is ineffective for palladium), a weak solution of sodium chloroplatinate is used instead. Sodium chloroplatinate, in contrast to potassium chlorate, does not cause grain. This formula is generally referred to as the &quot;Na2 method&quot;. This somewhat misleading abbreviation was coined by Richard Sullivan of Bostick &amp; Sullivan, one of the principal suppliers of chemistry and printing supplies, who popularized the process.

== History ==
The first person to have recorded observing the action of light rays on platinum was Ferdinand Gehlen of Germany in 1830. The following year, his countryman, Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner, determined that the action of light on platinum was quite weak, but that perhaps something could be combined with platinum to increase its sensitivity. Through experimentation, he eventually found that ferric oxalate was a highly-effective enhancer. The combination of these two metals remains the basis of the platinotype process in use today.

In 1832, Englishmen Sir John Herschel and Robert Hunt conducted their own experiments, further refining the chemistry of the process. In 1844, in his book &quot;Researches on Light&quot;, Hunt recorded the first known description of anyone employing platinum to make a photographic print. However, although he tried several different combinations of chemicals with platinum, none of them succeeded in producing any permanency in the image. All of his prints faded after several months.

Over the next decade, Hunt noted that platinum prints he had left in the dark faded very slowly but gradually resumed their original density, and had also shifted from a negative to a positive image, eventually becoming permanent.

By the early 1850s, however, other more reliable photographic processes, such as salt and albumen printing, had been developed and were beginning to be widely used. Those scientists who had previously conducted research on platinum lost interest in the process as other methods became more commercially viable. The only major advances in platinum research reported during that decade were made independently by C.J. Burnett and Lyonel Clark of Great Britain. In 1859, Burnett published an article in the &quot;British Journal of Photography&quot; describing his use of sodium chloroplatinate as a fixing agent. His modification of the platinum printing process resulted in prints that were permanent enough that he could exhibit them in public. That same year, Clark also exhibited prints made using a slightly different process.

== Patents ==
William Willis was the first to patent the platinotype process in 1873 (British Patent No. 2011, June 8, 1873), and again in 1878 and 1880, which he leveraged to gain commercial success in the manufacture of platinum papers sold through his Platinotype Company for professional and amateur use. He also developed the palladium process requiring palladiotype paper and a silver-platinum paper, Satista.

Willis introduced the &quot;hot bath&quot; method where a mixture of ferric oxalate and potassium chloroplatinate are coated onto paper which is then exposed through a negative and developed in a warm solution of potassium oxalate.

== Commercialization ==
While Willis had greatly advanced the chemistry of the platinum process, there was still no reliable method for the individual preparation of platinum paper by 1880. Two years, later two Austrian Army officers, Giuseppe Pizzighelli and Arthur Baron V. Hubl, published a dissertation describing a straightforward process for preparing the paper. They continued their research for several years, and in 1887, Pizzighelli patented a new process that made the commercial production of platinum paper viable for the first time. The new process was briefly known as a &quot;Pizzitype&quot; and was marketed under the name &quot;Dr. Jacoby&#x27;s Printing Out Paper.&quot;

Willis quickly countered this advance by obtaining two more patents in 1888 for cold-bath processes. By adding more platinum to the developing process, he produced prints that had dense brown-black shadows rather than the lighter browns that were the best that previous processes could produce. While much more aesthetically pleasing, prints developed by this process were difficult to produce reliably.

Four years later, Willis began manufacturing a platinum paper that was designed for the cold-bath process, and this became the standard for the rest of the decade. The business he started in 1880, called the Platinotype Company, rapidly expanded, and soon he was selling his paper throughout Europe and in the United States. By 1906, his company had sales totaling US $273,715 ($ in 2009 dollars), a significant amount at that time.

Seeing the skyrocketing demand for platinum paper, the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, tried to develop its own line of paper starting in 1901, but they could not duplicate the quality of Willis&#x27;s product. Kodak then tried to buy Willis&#x27;s company but was not able to come to an agreement. Kodak instead bought the relatively new company of Joseph Di Nunzio who had recently developed his own brand of platinum paper comparable to Willis&#x27;s, which he sold under the name of &quot;Angelo&quot;. Kodak continued to sell this paper for several years before it was eventually discontinued.

When Willis began marketing his paper, platinum was relatively cheap. By 1907, platinum had become 52 times more expensive than silver. Eastman Kodak and most other producers stopped fabrication of the paper in 1916. Russia controlled 90% of the world platinum supply in World War I and all available platinum was used in the war effort. Nevertheless, platinum paper has continued in use until the present, interrupted only by the world wars.

Beginning in 1964, Irving Penn began experimenting with platinum printing. Penn had spent his career up to that point making photographs that were seen almost exclusively in reproduction within the glossy pages of magazines and in his pivotal 1960 book &quot;Moments Preserved&quot;. Penn set himself the challenge of producing photographic prints that would surpass the technical limitations of reprographic media and deliver a deeper visual experience. He was drawn to the antiquated platinum process for its long grayscale – its ability to display a seemingly infinite array of gradations between pure white and absolute black.

The platinum process requires direct contact with the negative, without enlargement, so Penn first needed to create flawless negatives the same size as the desired print. He then hand-coated paper with platinum emulsion. When dry, the paper was sandwiched with the negative and exposed to light before processing. Rigorous experimentation revealed that recoating a print with a secondary emulsion and making a second or third exposure of the same image on a single sheet of paper yielded prints of greater depth and subtlety. Penn solved the problem of aligning and re-aligning the negative and the print surface over multiple exposures by borrowing a technique from the graphic arts: he mounted his paper on a sheet of aluminum with a series of registration guides along the top edge. Penn was guarded about the preparation of his emulsions and his precise formulations varied considerably. He frequently introduced palladium and iron salts into his coatings to achieve desired effects.

==Palladium==
In photography, the &quot;palladiotype&quot; is a less-common variant of the platinotype. The process came into greater use after World War I because the platinum used in the more-common platinotype quickly became too expensive. Due to the rising cost and the consequent shortage of commercial platinum paper, photographers tried to replace the platinum with the much cheaper palladium which gave similar effects. The cost of this metal, however, also started to rise and eventually around 1930 the process was abandoned in favor of more economical alternatives. In recent years, a handful of photographers have taken up the art of mixing platinum and palladium and printing fine art prints with those chemicals, despite its cost.

Characteristics of a palladium print, compared to a platinum print:
*A warmer tone
*Easier to solarize (see the Sabatier Effect)
*Large tonal range, up to D= 2.1, thus requiring a contrast-rich negative for printing
*Deeper blacks, with a higher maximum density
*A softer image, with delicate highlights

==Chemistry==
Platinum printing is based on the light sensitivity of ferric oxalate. Ferric oxalate is reduced to ferrous oxalate by UV-light. The ferrous oxalate then reacts with platinum(II) or palladium(II) reducing it to elemental platinum (or palladium), which builds up the image.

By varying the amount of platinum versus palladium and the addition of oxidizing chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide and potassium dichromate or potassium chlorate, the contrast and &quot;color&quot; of the final image can be modified. Because of the non-uniformity of the coating and mixing phases of the process, no two prints are exactly the same.

In 2002, working from research done by Howard Efner and Richard Sullivan, Dick Arentz formulated the methodology for using sodium chloroplatinate as a contrast control agent. Richard Sullivan coined the term Na2 and began to sell a 20% solution through Bostick and Sullivan. Arentz found that, since it is a platinum compound (sodium chloroplatinATE), it does not work with platinum prints (potassium chloroplatinITE). It does, however, shorten the scale of a pure palladium print. When minute quantities of sodium chloroplatinate are added to the palladium salt/ferric oxalate emulsion it produces the high-contrast prints needed for thin negatives, but does not exhibit the granularity found when using traditional chlorates. A palladium print made with potassium chlorate will take on a warm, sepia tone. The same print using sodium chloroplatinate will have cooler tones similar to those of a platinum/palladium print.
The inherent low sensitivity of the process occurs because the ferric oxalate is sensitive to ultraviolet light only, thus specialized light sources must be used and exposure times are many times greater than those used in silver-based photographic processes.
Due to the unavailability of pre-coated sensitized paper, all platinum/palladium printing is done on paper coated by the printer. The light sensitive chemicals are mixed from powdered basic chemicals, or some commercially available solutions, then hand applied with a brush or a cylindrical &quot;pusher&quot;.
Many artists achieve varying effects by choosing different papers for different surface characteristics, including vellum, 100% cotton rag, silk, and rice, among others. On the collecting market, platinum prints often sell for many times what a similar silver-gelatin print would bring.

<text>Khanbaliq (; , &quot;Qaɣan balɣasu&quot;) or Dadu of Yuan (; , &quot;Dayidu&quot;) was the winter capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty in what is now Beijing, the capital of China today. It was located at the center of modern Beijing. The Secretariat directly administered the Central Region () of the Yuan dynasty (comprising present-day Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and parts of Henan and Inner Mongolia) and dictated policies for the other provinces. As emperors of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan and his successors also claimed supremacy over the entire Mongol Empire following the death of Möngke (Kublai&#x27;s brother and predecessor) in 1259. Over time the unified empire gradually fragmented into a number of khanates.

Khanbaliq is the direct predecessor to modern Beijing. Several stations of the modern city&#x27;s subway&#x27;s Line 10 and Line 13 are named after the gates of Dadu.

== Name ==
The name Khanbaliq comes from the Turkic language &quot;khan&quot; (&quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;king&quot;) and &quot;balik&quot; (&quot;town&quot;, &quot;permanent settlement&quot;): &quot;City of the Khan&quot;. It was actually in use among the Turks and Mongols &quot;before&quot; the fall of Zhongdu, in reference to the Jin emperors of Manchuria. It is traditionally written as Cambaluc in English, after its spelling in Rustichello&#x27;s retelling of Marco Polo&#x27;s travels. The &quot;Travels&quot; also uses the spellings Cambuluc and Kanbalu.

The name Dadu is the pinyin transcription of the Chinese name , meaning &quot;Grand Capital&quot;. The Mongols also called the city Daidu, which was a transliteration directly from the Chinese. In modern Chinese, it is referred to as Yuan Dadu to distinguish it from other cities which have similar names.
== History ==
Zhongdu, the &quot;Central Capital&quot; of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, was located at a nearby site now part of Xicheng District. It was destroyed by Genghis Khan in 1215 when the Jin court began contemplating a move south to a more defensible capital such as Kaifeng. The Imperial Mint () established in 1260 and responsible for the printing of jiaochao, the Yuan fiat paper money, was probably located at nearby Yanjing even before the establishment of the new capital.

In 1264, Kublai Khan visited the Daming Palace on Jade Island in Taiye Lake and was so enchanted with the site that he directed his capital to be constructed around the garden. The chief architect and planner of the capital was Liu Bingzhong, who also served as supervisor of its construction. His student Guo Shoujing and the Muslim Ikhtiyar al-Din were also involved.

The construction of the walls of the city began in the same year, while the main imperial palace () was built from 1274 onwards. The design of Khanbaliq followed several rules laid down in the Confucian classic &quot;The Rites of Zhou&quot;, including &quot;9 vertical and horizontal axes&quot;, &quot;palaces in front, markets in back&quot;, &quot;ancestral worship to the left, divine worship to the right&quot;. It was broad in scale, strict in planning and execution, and complete in equipment.

A year after the 1271 establishment of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan proclaimed the city his capital under the name Dadu as it is interpreted capital city in Hanzi and named Khanbaliq as referred in the state diplomatic letters in Mongolian. The construction was not fully completed until 1293. His previous seat at Shangdu (Xanadu) became the summer capital.

As part of the Great Khans&#x27; policy of religious tolerance, Khanbaliq had various houses of worship. Almost every major religious tradition and sect in China and the wider world had a presence in the city. Orders of rabbi, Taoist sects, Mongol shamans, and various kinds of Hindu religious groups were some of the most well-known religious minorities in the city. Buddhists, Muslims, Church of the East Christians, Catholics, and Confucianists were more common.

Confucians and Taoists were extremely well-regarded by most Mongol nobles, and &quot;some of the Mongols&#x27; most esteemed advisors were Taoists and Confucians.&quot;

It even was the seat of a Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khanbaliq from 1307 until its 1357 suppression. It was restored in 1609 as (then) Diocese of Peking.

The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty sent an army to Dadu in 1368. The last Yuan emperor fled north to Shangdu while the Ming razed the palaces of their capital to the ground. The former capital was renamed Beiping (北平 &quot;Pacified North&quot;) and Shuntian Prefecture was established in the area around the city.

The Hongwu Emperor was succeeded by his young grandson the Jianwen Emperor. His attempts to rein in the fiefs of his powerful uncles provoked the Jingnan Rebellion and ultimately his usurpation by his uncle, the Prince of Yan. Yan&#x27;s powerbase lay in Shuntian and he quickly resolved to move his capital north from Yingtian (Nanjing) to the ruins at Beiping. He shortened the northern boundaries of the city and added a new and separately walled southern district. Upon the southern extension of the Taiye Lake (the present Nanhai), the raising of Wansui Hill over Yuan ruins, and the completion of the Forbidden City to its south, he declared the city his northern capital Beijing. With one brief interruption, it has borne the name ever since.

== Legacy ==
Ruins of the Yuan-era walls of Khanbaliq are still extant and are known as the Tucheng (), &quot;earth wall&quot;. Tucheng Park preserves part of the old northern walls, along with some modern statues.
Despite the capture and renaming of the city by the Ming, the name &quot;Daidu&quot; remained in use among the Mongols of the Mongolia-based Northern Yuan dynasty. The lament of the last Yuan emperor, Toghon Temür, concerning the loss of Khanbaliq and Shangdu, is recorded in many Mongolian historical chronicles such as the &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; and the &quot;Asarayci Neretu-yin Teuke&quot;.

&quot;Khanbaliq&quot; remained the standard name for Beijing in Persian and the Turkic languages of Central Asia and the Middle East for quite a long time. It was, for instance, the name used in both the Persian and Turkic versions of Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh&#x27;s account of the 1419–22 mission of Shah Rukh&#x27;s envoys to the Ming capital. The account remained one of the most detailed and widely read accounts of China in these languages for centuries.

When European travelers reached China by sea via Malacca and the Philippines in the 16th century, they were not initially aware that China was the same country as the &quot;Cathay&quot; about which they had read in Marco Polo nor that his &quot;Cambaluc&quot; was the city known to the southern Chinese as Pekin. It was not until the Jesuit Matteo Ricci&#x27;s first visit to Beijing in 1598 that he encountered Central Asian visitors (&quot;Arabian Turks, or Mohammedans&quot; in his description) who confirmed that the city they were in was &quot;Cambaluc.&quot; The publication of his journals by his aide announced to Europe that &quot;Cathay&quot; was China and &quot;Cambaluc&quot; Beijing. The journal then fancifully explained that name was &quot;partly of Chinese and partly of Tartar origin&quot;, from &quot;Tartar&quot; &quot;cam&quot; (&quot;great&quot;), Chinese &quot;&quot; (&quot;north&quot;), and Chinese &quot;Lu&quot; (used for nomads in Chinese literature). Many European maps continued to show &quot;Cathay&quot; and its capital &quot;Cambaluc&quot; somewhere in northeast China for much of the 17th century.

<text>Wakhan, or &quot;the Wakhan&quot; (also spelt Vakhan; Persian and , &quot;Vâxân&quot; and &quot;Wāxān&quot; respectively; , &quot;Vaxon&quot;), is a rugged, mountainous part of the Pamir, Hindu Kush and Karakoram regions of Afghanistan. Wakhan District is a district in Badakshan Province.

==Geography==

The Wakhan is located in the extreme north-east of Afghanistan. It contains the headwaters of the Amu Darya (Oxus) River, and was an ancient corridor for travellers from the Tarim Basin to Badakshan. The geographic position of Wakhan between China, India, and Bactria allowed it to play a major role in trade in the ancient world.

Until 1883, the Wakhan included the whole valley of the Panj River and the Pamir River, as well as the upper flow of the Panj River known as the Wakhan River. An 1873 agreement between UK and Russia split the Wakhan by delimiting spheres of influence for the two countries at the Panj and Pamir rivers. Since then, the name Wakhan is now generally used to refer to the Afghan area south of the two rivers. The northern part of the historic Wakhan is now part of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in Tajikistan.

The only road into the Wakhan is a rough track from Ishkashim past Qila-e Panja to Sarhad-e Broghil. Paths lead from the end of the road to the Wakhjir Pass, a mountain pass leading to China which is closed to travellers.

The western part of the Wakhan, between Ishkashim and Qila-e Panja, is known as &quot;Lower Wakhan&quot;, which includes the valley of the Panj River. The valleys of the Wakhan River, the Pamir River and their tributaries, and the terrain between, are known as &quot;Upper Wakhan&quot;.

The eastern extremity of Upper Wakhan is known as the &quot;Pamir Knot&quot;, the area where the Himalayas, Tian Shan, Karakoram, Kunlun, and Hindu Kush ranges meet. West of the Pamir Knot is the Little Pamir, a broad U-shaped grassy valley 100 km long and 10 km wide, which contains Chaqmaqtin Lake, the headwaters of the Aksu or Murghab River. At the eastern end of the Little Pamir is the Tegermansu Valley, from where the closed Tegermansu Pass (4,827 m) leads to China. The Great Pamir or &quot;Big Pamir&quot;, a 60 km long valley south of Zorkol lake, drained by the Pamir River, lies to the northwest of the Little Pamir.

The mountain range that divides the two Pamirs is known as the Nicholas Range. West of the Nicholas Range, between the Great Pamir and the lower valley of the Wakhan River, is the &quot;Wakhan Range&quot;, which culminates in the &quot;Koh-e Pamir&quot; (6,320 m).

The roads in the region have small shrines to Ismaili Muslim pirs and are adorned with &quot;special stones and curled ibex and sheep horns&quot;, which are symbols of purity in the Zoroastrian faiths, once present in the region before the arrival of Islam.

=== Wakhan Corridor ===
The Wakhan is connected to Tashkurgan Tajik County, China, by a long, narrow strip called the Wakhan Corridor, which separates the Gorno-Badakhshan region of Tajikistan from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.

The Wakhan River flows through the corridor from the east to Qila-e Panja where it joins the Pamir River to become the Panj River which then forms the border.

In the south the corridor is bordered by the high mountains of the Hindu Kush, crossed by the Broghol pass, the Irshad Pass and the disused Dilisang Pass to Pakistan.

==History==

Historically the Wakhan has been an important region for thousands of years as it is where the western and eastern portions of Central Asia meet.

=== Ancient history ===
Western Wakhan (休密 &quot;Xiumi&quot;) was conquered in the early part of the 1st century CE by Kujula Kadphises, the first &quot;Great Kushan,&quot; and was one of the five &quot;xihou&quot; or principalities that formed the nucleus of the original Kushan kingdom. Wakhan was administered by the Kushan indirectly through semi-independent rulers who oversaw trade on the Buddhist Route of the Silk Road.

=== Wakhan Mirdom ===

Until 1883 Wakhan was a semi-independent principality on both sides of the Panj and Pamir Rivers, ruled by a hereditary ruler (&quot;mir&quot;) with its capital at Qila-e Panja. It was a tributary to Badakhshan, which itself was a tributary state of Qing China. However, in the 1750s when the Qing dynasty conquered the Dzungar Khanate, Wakhan and Shighnan were incorporated into the Qing dynasty. The Khanate of Kokand eventually annexed Wakhan and Shighnan from Qing China by the 1830s.

=== Conquest by Afghanistan ===
Agreements between Britain and Russia in 1873 and between Britain and Afghanistan in 1893 effectively split the historic area of Wakhan by making the Panj and Pamir Rivers the border between Afghanistan and the Russian Empire. On its south side, the Durand Line agreement of 1893 marked the boundary between British India and Afghanistan. This left a narrow strip of land as a buffer between the two empires. In the 1880s (1880-1895), under pressure from Britain, Abdur Rahman Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan, imposed Afghan rule on the Wakhan. The last Mir of Wakhan, Ali Mardan Khan fled to Chitral, where he was allotted land in Ishkoman Valley.

=== Modern history ===
In 1949, when Mao Zedong completed the Communist takeover of China, the borders were permanently closed, sealing off the 2,000-year-old caravan route and turning the corridor into a . When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, they occupied the Wakhan and built strong military posts at Sarhad-e Broghil and elsewhere. To facilitate access they built a bridge across the Pamir River at Prip, near Gaz Khan. However, the area did not see fighting.

In 2010 the Wakhan was reported to be peaceful and unaffected by the war in the rest of Afghanistan.

==Demographics==
Wakhan is sparsely populated. The total population is estimated at 10,600. Wakhi and Kyrgyz are the major ethnic groups of Wakhan. Most of its inhabitants speak the Vakhi or Wakhi language (x̌ik zik), and belong to an ethnic group known as Vakhi or Wakhi. Nomadic Kyrgyz herders live at the higher altitudes.

According to a 2003 report by the United Nations Environment Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization, the population of Wakhan suffers from lack of education, poverty, ill health, food insecurity and opium addiction.

===Wakhi===

The Wakhi population of Wakhan was 9,444 in 2003. Almost all of them adhere to the Shia Ismaili faith and some of them speak Wakhi language. Wakhi people also inhabit several areas adjacent to the Wakhan in Tajikistan, Pakistan and China.

The Wakhi practice agriculture in the river valleys, and herd animals in the summer pastures at higher elevations.

The dominant sect of Islam in the region is Ismaili, much milder than the strict form of Islam generally practiced in the country. In Ishkashim, the city at the western mouth of the Wakhan, stricter observance is demanded. The area has been long neglected by the central government of Afghanistan. People are poor, many being traditional pastoralists living in yurts and lacking basic services. Non-governmental organizations such as the Aga Khan Development Network foundation have taken an interest in the area. The Central Asia Institute, founded by Greg Mortenson, has built 11 schools in the region.

There is a trickle of tourists who engage in trekking and mountaineering.

Alastair Leithead of BBC News 24 on 26 December 2007, presented a half-hour feature about Wakhan, focusing particularly on the work of the expatriate British doctor Alexander Duncan, which provided a significant piece of extended media reporting from this inaccessible area. He has also covered the Pamir Festival in the area.

===Kyrgyz===
The Kyrgyz population of Wakhan was 1,130 in 2003, all in the eastern part of Wakhan. The Kyrgyz are Sunni Hanafi Muslims.

The suppression of the 1916 rebellion against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz to later migrate to China and Afghanistan. Most Kyrgyz refugees settled in Wakhan region of Afghanistan.

Until 1978, the northeastern portion of Wakhan (the Great Pamir and the Little Pamir) was home to about 3,000-5,000 ethnic Kyrgyz. In 1978 almost all the Kyrgyz inhabitants fled to Pakistan in the aftermath of the Saur Revolution. They requested 5,000 visas from the United States Consulate in Peshawar for resettlement in Alaska (a region that shares a similar climate and temperature with the Wakhan Corridor). Their request was denied. In the meantime, the heat and the unsanitary conditions of the refugee camp were killing the Kyrgyz refugees at an alarming rate. Turkey, which was then under the military coup rule of General Kenan Evren, stepped in, and resettled the entire group in the Lake Van region of Turkey in 1982. The village of Ulupamir (or &quot;Great Pamir&quot; in Kyrgyz) in Erciş on Lake Van was given to them, and more than 5,000 of them still reside today. The documentary film &quot;37 Uses for a Dead Sheep – the story of the Pamir Kirghiz&quot; was based on the life of these Kyrgyz/Kirgiz in their new home.

Kyrgyz from Wakhan region of Afghanistan moved to Pakistan in the 1970s. Nearly 1,100 of them were accepted by Turkey to settle in Ulupamir (or &quot;Great Pamir&quot; in Kyrgyz), their resettlement village in Van Province.

Some Kyrgyz returned to the Wakhan in October 1979, following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

==Tourism==

In recent years the Wakhan has become a destination for adventurous trekkers, and several tour companies offer trips to the area. BBC correspondent John Simpson has recommended the area as a place to take a wonderful, and relatively safe, holiday. Kate Humble, a BBC television presenter, reports that the area is beautiful and the people friendly. The entire Wakhan was designated as the protected Wakhan National Park in 2014.

==Popular culture==
The Wakhan plays a large role in Greg Mortenson&#x27;s book, &quot;Stones into Schools&quot;. This book tells the story of the building of a school in the Kyrgyz village of Bozai Gumbaz. The factual accuracy of this account is strongly disputed in Jon Krakauer&#x27;s ebook &quot;Three Cups of Deceit&quot;.

<doc id="870991" wikidata="Q6246303" url="?curid=870991" title="John Maclellan, 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright">
<text>John MacLellan, born in Borgue, Kirkcudbrightshire, Dumfries &amp; Galloway, Scotland, was the 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright, a title he held from 1648, when his cousin Thomas McClellan 2nd Lord Kirkcudbright died, until 1665. John was the son of John MacLellan of Borgue born c. 1585 and Margaret Coupar. 

== Biography ==

In 1642, John married Ann Maxwell, daughter of Sir Robert Maxwell of Orchardton. Ann was the granddaughter of the 1st Lord Kirkcudbright, and their union consolidated the family&#x27;s noble position. They had only one surviving son, William McClellan, who succeeded John as the 4th Lord Kirkcudbright after his death.

John McClellan was deeply involved in the religious and political struggles of his time, which centered around the conflict between the Presbyterian Covenanters and the Royalists during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. A zealous Presbyterian, he was also a fervent opponent of the English Parliament, particularly Cromwell and his supporters. This passionate commitment to the Presbyterian cause led to significant personal and financial hardships. McClellan had to mortgage much of his estate in the name of supporting the war effort.

In June 1648, John McClellan was formally recognized as Lord Kirkcudbright, heir to the McClellan lands and title through a legal process called a &quot;retour of special service.&quot; This process confirmed him as the rightful successor to the late Thomas McClellan 2nd Lord Kirkcudbright, in the lands and barony of Bombie, Kirkcudbright.

McClellan’s military career began in the aftermath of the defeat of the Scottish forces at the Battle of Dunbar. In February 1649, he was appointed Colonel of Foot for the counties of Galloway, Ayrshire, and Renfrewshire, and was tasked with raising a regiment of soldiers to fight in the ongoing conflict. Initially, the regiment was to have 800 men, but McClellan struggled to recruit sufficient forces, and only a fraction of the expected soldiers was raised. Despite these setbacks, McClellan&#x27;s forces fought in the Irish campaigns of 1649, where they faced severe defeats, including a disastrous engagement at Lissnagerry, Ulster, which nearly wiped out his regiment.

In 1650, McClellan’s military efforts were again called into action as part of the larger Scottish resistance against the English Commonwealth. He was involved in raising further troops for the disastrous Dunbar campaign and, after the defeat at the Battle of Dunbar, his surviving troops were reorganized into dragoons and sent to fight in the Western Association Army. However, after the Battle of Hamilton in December 1650, McClellan’s forces were defeated, and the remnants of his regiment were eventually surrendered to the English.

Beyond his military involvement, John McClellan was entangled in the religious and political controversies of the time. As a Presbyterian, he strongly opposed the rise of Episcopalianism, particularly the introduction of John Jaffrey as the Episcopalian minister at the Kirkcudbright church in 1663. This opposition led to violent riots, during which McClellan and others were arrested and imprisoned in Edinburgh. McClellan was fined for his role in the disturbances.

He also played an active role in the politics of the Covenanters. In 1648, he participated in the Committee of Estates, the governing body of Scotland during the period of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In 1649, he corresponded with John McClellan, a minister in Kirkcudbright, discussing the contentious issue of church patronage, which was a subject of considerable debate at the time. The correspondence indicated McClellan&#x27;s commitment to a Presbyterian form of church governance and his disdain for the increasing influence of royalist and Episcopalian factions.

Despite his dedication to the Presbyterian cause and the sacrifices he made during the civil wars, McClellan’s financial situation was precarious. He had incurred heavy debts and was forced to mortgage his lands several times. In 1653, the estate of Bombie, which was part of his holdings, was seized due to unpaid loans. Similar actions were taken regarding his other estates at Skellarie Plantation and Kirkcudbright.

McClellan was also involved in a dispute over his right to precedence in the Scottish Parliament, protesting against the seating of Lord Forrester and Lord Pitsligo in a session of Parliament in January 1661. He claimed that his patent granted him seniority over these lords. In 1677, McClellan was noted as having served as the Commissioner for Excise in Kirkcudbrightshire, despite the decline of his fortune. 

John McClellan 3rd Lord Kirkcudbright, died in 1665. Following his death, his widow Ann Maxwell received a liferent (a right to the use of the deceased&#x27;s property for life), and the remainder of his estate was eventually passed on to his son, William McClellan, who succeeded him as the 4th Lord Kirkcudbright.

<text>Shewa (; ; Somali: Shawa; , ), formerly romanized as Shua, Shoa, Showa, Shuwa, is a historical region of Ethiopia which was formerly an autonomous kingdom within the Ethiopian Empire. The modern Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa is located at its center.

The towns of Debre Berhan, Antsokia, Ankober, Entoto and, after Shewa became a province of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa have all served as the capital of Shewa at various times. Most of northern Shewa, made up of the districts of Menz, Tegulet, Yifat, Menjar and Bulga, is populated by Christian Amharas, while southern Shewa is inhabited by the Gurages and eastern Shewa has large Oromo and Argobba Muslim populations. The monastery of Debre Libanos, founded by Saint Tekle Haymanot, is located in the district of Selale, Oromia Modern Shewa includes the historical Endagabatan province.

== History ==

Shewa first appears in the historical record as part of a Muslim state (Makhzumi dynasty), which G. W. B. Huntingford believed was founded in 896, and had its capital at Walalah. In 2006, a team of French archaeologists uncovered three urban centers believed to have been remnants of the former Sultanate of Ifat, with the Nora site in eastern Shewa being the most notable among them.

Yekuno Amlak based his uprising against the Zagwe dynasty from an enclave in Shewa. He claimed Solomonic forebears, direct descendants of the pre-Zagwe Axumite emperors, who had used Shewa as their safe haven when their survival was threatened by Gudit and other enemies. This is the reason why the region got the name &quot;Shewa&quot; which means &#x27;rescue&#x27; or &#x27;save&#x27;. This claim is supported by the &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, a book written under one of the descendants of Yekuno Amlak, which mentions Shewa as part of the realm of Menelik I. Aksum and its predecessor Dʿmt were mostly limited to Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea during the 1st millennium BCE. However, Shewa eventually became a part of Abyssinia upon the rise of the Amhara Solomonic dynasty. Dawit I and his successors stayed in Fatagar (part of Shewa) for a long time in Tobya (Yifat, Fatagar). The province served as the birthplace of the future emperors Zara Yaqob and Dawit II. Zara Yaqob and Na&#x27;od would then make Debre Berhan and Zway their capitals respectively. In 1528 Shewa was overrun by Muslim invaders from the Sultanate of Adal to the east, and its ancient cities were destroyed.

Most of Shewa was overrun by the Oromos during the late 16th century. Its eastern fringe was reportedly inhabited by the Harla people according to the Karrayyu Oromo. According to oral traditions, Shewa had a powerful king named Sarako, who prevented the people from bearing arms. A certain giant arose against Sarako, and his children, and destroyed them. When the clans of the
Borana, Gombichu and Ada, entered Shewa, they found no-one to stop them, since the children of Sarako had been killed. Enrico Cerulli believes that this tradition is related to the Amhara tradition of an arrogant king, which is attributed to Emperor Dawit II. However, he also notes that Sarako is the Gurage name for Emperor Zara Yaqob, from this he concludes that the Oromo acquired the Sarako tradition through their contact with the Gurage. 
The Amhara Shewan ruling family was founded in the late 17th century by Negasi Krestos, who consolidated his control around Yifat and extended his territory to the south by conquering Menz, Tegulet and Merhabete from the Oromos. Upon rising to power, Sahle Selassie aligned himself to the Abichu Oromo and turn his attention to the Tulama Oromo, whom he defeated in the early 1820s. He followed this victory by rebuilding Debre Berhan, which had been burned in an Oromo raid, as well as a number of other towns and consolidated his hold by founding a number of fortified villages, like Angolalla, in the Abichu territory. He extended the frontier of Shewa into Bulga and Karayu, to the southeast into Arsi, and as far south as the territories of the Gurage. After a few years, Sahle Selassie felt his position secure enough that he proclaimed himself Negus, or king, of Shewa, Ifat, the Oromo and the Gurage peoples, without the authority of the Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar.

After the death of Sahle Selassie in 1847, Shewa fell under the rule of his son, Haile Melekot. Shewa soon attracted the attention of Emperor Tewodros II, who mobilized his army in Wollo and advanced into Shewa in October 1855. The Emperor advanced into Tegulet and around the same time the Oromo seized the opportunity to rebel and burnt Ankober to the ground. Haile Melekot, decided to prevent Debre Berhan from falling into the hands of his enemy and had the town put to flames, he then fled to a nearby hill where he hoped to hide but soon died of an illness on November 10. After Haile Melekot&#x27; death, Tewdoros&#x27; opponents rallied behind the late king&#x27;s son, Menelik II. Tewdoros left his camp at Debre Berhan and pursued the boy to Bakarat where he was captured and imprisoned at his mountain stronghold in Amba Mariam. After crushing the Amhara opposition in the province, Tewdoros then turned his attention towards the Oromo and according to Zanab &quot;exterminated all the Gallas, from Debre Berhan to Ankober so that their corpses covered the ground like a carpet.&quot;

Menelik II, who escaped from Amba Mariam at the end of June 1865 when he was twenty one years old, quickly returned to war-ravaged Shewa. During the first part of his reign, he ordered the reconstruction of various fortified towns such as Ankober, Debre Berhan and Warra Ilu. These sites had the advantage of being in the center of his realm, enabling him to remain in contact with the Christians to the south and the Muslim Oromos in the northeast. The area around these town moreover had rich pastures capable of feeding numerous cavalry and other livestock. After the Egyptian-Ethiopian War, Emperor Yohannes IV, who was angered over Menelik&#x27;s claim to be the Emperor, marched into Shewa and ravaged the towns. Menelik, realizing that resistance was futile, was forced to submit to Yohannes.

Escaping influence from Yohannes, Menelik moved his capital south from Ankober to Mount Entoto in 1884. There, his wife Taytu Betul was attracted to a nearby spring known as Finfinne by the local Oromo inhabitants. In the spring of 1886, Menelik chose the site for Addis Ababa, his future capital. Building began at once, and, when Menelik became emperor of the whole country in 1889, Addis Ababa became the capital of Ethiopia.

<text>Lituanica was a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker airplane flown from the United States across the Atlantic Ocean by Lithuanian pilots Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas in 1933. After successfully flying 6,411 km (4,043 miles), it crashed, due to undetermined circumstances, 650 km (404 miles) from its destination, Kaunas, Lithuania.

== The aircraft ==

On June 18, 1932, the pilots purchased the Pacemaker airplane, serial no. 137, registered as NC-688E, from the Pal-Waukee Company for $3,200. First produced and flown in 1929, forty units of the CH-300 Pacemaker were eventually built. It was a single-engine, six-seat, high-wing monoplane. The fuselage was welded chromoly steel tubing covered with fabric. The cabin interior was covered with a sound-absorbing material. The fuselage had side and top windows, with doors on both sides. The wings were of wooden construction, with two spars, also fabric-covered. The spars and ribs were made of spruce strips and plywood. The wings had two gasoline tanks with a total capacity of . Wing struts were 2/3 wood, 1/3 steel (at the wings) with aero-dynamic steel ribs, fabric-covered, giving an additional 47 ft² (4.4 m²) lifting surface. Tail surfaces were made of welded steel tubing. The horizontal stabilizer was of spruce strips and plywood, with the trim-angle adjustable in flight. The landing gear was a curved steel bar with rubber rope suspension. Wheels 30 × 5 inches (762 by 127 mm). The engine was a Wright J6, radial, air cooled, 9 cylinders, 300 hp (225 kW). Funds for the plane was raised from numerous Lithuanian clubs and organizations, including air shows.

On January 20, 1933, the aircraft was moved to E. M. Laird workshops at 5321 W. 65th St. in the Clearing Industrial District, Chicago, where she was rebuilt and outfitted for the transatlantic flight. New elongated wings were built, with two additional gasoline tanks installed in the fuselage, having and capacity, each equipped with emergency dump valves. Beneath the pilot&#x27;s seat a oil tank was outfitted with 12 cooling tubes. A longer horizontal stabilizer was built. Aero-dynamic wheel fairings were installed, and the fuselage received a new fabric covering. A new, higher compression engine, 365 hp (272 kW) Wright Whirlwind J6-9E, ser. No. 12733, had a &quot;speed ring&quot;. On March 29, 1933, the rebuild was complete, and the registration number was changed to NR-688E, and the aircraft was painted orange. On both sides of the fuselage scrolls with the names of the sponsors were painted. The aircraft was dubbed &quot;Lituanica&quot;, Latin for &quot;Lithuania&quot;.

== Pilots ==

Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas were Lithuanian pilots, emigrants to the United States, who made a significant flight in the history of world aviation. On July 15, 1933, they flew across the Atlantic Ocean, covering a distance of 3,984 miles (6,411 kilometers) without landing, in 37 hours and 11 minutes (107.1 mph). In terms of comparison, as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned, their result ranked second only to that of Russell Boardman and John Polando, and ranked fourth in terms of duration of flight at the time. Although Darius and Girenas did not have navigational equipment and flew under unfavorable weather conditions, the flight was one of the most precise in aviation history. It equaled, and in some aspects surpassed, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s classic flight. 

==Flight==
An ordinary unmodified plane of this size cannot cover a comparable distance (the Cessna 152, for instance, has a range of 1200 km), even today. The flight was also important from a scientific and technological perspective, as it explored air flows and the capabilities of this type of aircraft. 
In their last letter, the pilots wrote that either a successful flight or a possible catastrophe would be valuable and significant enough and hence it was worthwhile to fly in either case.

After taking off from Floyd Bennett Field in New York on July 15, 1933, 6:24 am EDT, Darius and Girėnas successfully crossed the Atlantic, only to perish on July 17, 0:36 am (CET) by the village of Kuhdamm, near Soldin, Germany (now Pszczelnik, near Myślibórz, Poland (52°51&#x27;11.57&quot;N 14°50&#x27;17.78&quot;E)). The planned route was: New York – Newfoundland – Atlantic Ocean – Ireland – London – Amsterdam – Swinemünde – Königsberg – Kaunas airport (a total of 7,186 km). Due to weather conditions over Ireland, they veered to the north and reached Germany via Scotland and the North Sea. In 37 hours and 11 minutes, until the moment of the crash, they had flown 6411 km (over 7000 km in actual flight path), only 636 km short of their goal—Kaunas.

== Possible reasons for the crash ==

A Lithuanian board of investigation was appointed to determine the cause. It concluded that the pilots were properly qualified, and the aircraft was properly outfitted. They added that the most difficult part of the flight was executed with great precision. The commission concluded that during the crash the aircraft engine was running (the propeller was rotating), and there was enough fuel on board.

Some sources mention pilot error, but both pilots were highly experienced. During his career as pilot, Darius had never been involved in any previous accidents. In 1931, Girėnas had won first prize in a flight festival in Chicago for gliding his plane and landing with a dead engine.

According to the board, the catastrophe occurred due to difficult weather conditions combined with engine defects. The crash most probably was a result of failed emergency landing. There were rumors and suspicions in some quarters, that the plane was shot down, having been mistaken for a spy plane, because it flew near a concentration camp. Autopsies of pilots revealed no signs of bullets. However, not all parts of the plane were returned to the Lithuanian government.

== After the crash ==

On July 19, a German Deruluft airplane carried the bodies of the pilots back to Lithuania. The people of Kaunas met the heroes in great sorrow. The funeral was a solemn occasion and was the cause of official national mourning.

A few months after the &quot;Lituanica&quot; tragedy, some prominent members of the Chicago Lithuanian community discussed the possibility of financing another transatlantic flight. This idea was greeted with much enthusiasm, and enough funds were raised during the Great Depression. A faster and more modern Lockheed Vega was purchased from the Lockheed Aircraft Corp., the same model used by Wiley Post in his round-the-world flight, and by Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.

The aircraft was christened &quot;Lituanica II&quot; on Sunday, April 22, 1934. When the pilot originally chosen for the flight unexpectedly resigned in the spring, the Lithuanian organizers turned to Felix Waitkus, and he accepted the challenge. Although he landed in Ireland and not in Kaunas, he entered aviation history for being the sixth pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic.

In 1934 the bodies of Darius and Girėnas were embalmed by professor Jurgis Zilinskas.
In 1936 the Lithuanian government decided to build a mausoleum for Darius and Girėnas in Kaunas&#x27; old cemetery, that was destroyed after Soviet re-occupation. From then until the present day, the wreckage of &quot;Lituanica&quot; has been on display in the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas.

The pilots&#x27; bodies rest in the Military Cemetery of Šančiai, Kaunas.

==Memorials==
Chicago&#x27;s Lithuanian community erected an Art Deco Monument commemorating Girėnas and Darius in Chicago&#x27;s Marquette Park in 1935 where it still stands to this day. Feliksas Vaitkus was inspired by the flight and commemorated it with the flight of the Lituanica II in 1935.

The flight is commemorated in a movie &quot;Skrydis per Atlantą&quot; (Flight over the Atlantic) (1983). Kaunas&#x27;s sports stadium, S.Darius and S.Girėnas Stadium, where the Lithuanian national soccer team plays its home matches, is also named in their honor. There is a tall stone monument near the stadium, the Lithuanian Academy of Sport and the Ąžuolynas Park dedicated to the pilots.

Sculptor Bronius Pundzius made a relief of the pilots&#x27; faces on the Puntukas, then the largest known boulder in the territory of Lithuania, in 1943.

In New York City, in 1957, the fliers were memorialized with a granite flagstaff showing the pair in bas-relief. The monument is located in Lithuania Square, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

In Kaunas, a model of the Lituanica was put in 2013 to commemorate 80 years of the event.

Lituanica Ave, Bridgeport neighborhood in Chicago, IL is named after this flight. The avenue runs between Halsted and Morgan streets from 31st and 35th streets, and after a jog east proceeds south to 38th place between Sangamon and Halsted streets.

The small town of Beverly Shores, Indiana (just west of Michigan City, Indiana), has another memorial to the Lituanica flight. There, in 1968, the American Lithuanian Club established a park and named it Lituanica Park after the Bellanca CH-300 used in the flight. In 1971, to honor the pilots, a large modern sculpture by J. Barkis was placed in the park&#x27;s pond.

Before the flight Girėnas and Darius left a testament to the Lithuanian nation:

<text>Aukštaitija (; literally &quot;Highland&quot; or &quot;Upland&quot;) is the name of one of five ethnographic regions of Lithuania. The name comes from the fact that the lands are in the upper basin of the Nemunas, as opposed to the Lowlands that begin from Šiauliai westward. Although Kaunas is surrounded by Aukštaitija, the city itself is not considered to be a part of any ethnographic region in most cases.

==Geography==
Aukštaitija is in the northeast part of Lithuania and also encompasses a small part of Latvia and Belarus. The largest city located entirely within this region, Panevėžys, is considered to be the capital, though not in a political sense. Sometimes Utena is regarded as a symbolical capital.

The largest cities by population are:
* Panevėžys – 84,587
* Jonava – 26,423
* Utena – 25,397
* Kėdainiai – 22,677
* Ukmergė – 20,154
* Visaginas – 18,024
* Radviliškis – 15,161

The region has many lakes, mainly on the eastern side.

==Subdivisions==

==History==
Historically, Aukštaitija corresponded to the Duchy of Lithuania until the 13th century. Its initial capital was most likely Kernavė. In the 1322 treaty of Gediminas, Aukštaitija was called &quot;terra Eustoythen&quot; (land of Aukštaitians). Some German sources also titled Grand Duke Gediminas, after whom the Gediminids dynasty is named, &quot;Rex de Owsteiten&quot; (King of Aukštaitija). Aukštaitija was mentioned as &quot;Austechia&quot; in &quot;Chronicon terrae Prussiae&quot;, written around 1326. Politically, from the end of the 13th century, it comprised the Duchy of Vilnius/Lithuania and the Duchy of Trakai, and it is possible that the term was then used to refer to both of them. Since the 15th century, the Trakai and Vilnius voivodeships made up Aukštaitija, a political and ethnic entity also known as Lithuania proper.

==Demographics==
The local people mainly speak the Aukštaitian dialect of Lithuanian. Under the new classification of dialects, Lithuanian is divided into only two dialects, Aukštaitian and Samogitian, with all other varieties now classified as subdialects. The Sudovian and Dzūkian dialects are also considered subdialects of Aukštaitian; the specific subdialect spoken in Aukštaitija is thus known as East Aukštaitian.

The region has Russian and Belarusian minorities in the east. The subdialects spoken there use more loanwords from those languages. However, the usage of dialects in the region, as in Lithuania in general, is declining.

<text>Caledonian Road &amp; Barnsbury is a station on the Mildmay line of the London Overground, located in the London Borough of Islington in north London.

The station is situated in Travelcard Zone 2. There is an official out-of-station interchange with Caledonian Road tube station on the Piccadilly line of the London Underground, located a walk away. 

==History==

The station opened in 1870 as &quot;Barnsbury&quot; replacing the 1852 Caledonian Road station which was slightly west of the present site. Barnsbury was renamed &quot;Caledonian Road &amp; Barnsbury&quot; in 1893.

Between 14 May 1979 and 11 May 1985 the station was served by the Crosstown Linkline diesel multiple unit service between Camden Road and North Woolwich. 

To allow four-car trains to run on the London Overground network, the North London line between and Stratford closed in February 2010, and reopened 1 June that year, in order for a new signalling system to be installed and 30 platforms to be extended. After the reopening the work continued until May 2011 with a reduced service and none on Sundays.

==Design==
The station entrance on Offord Street leads to the old westbound platform (until February 2010) from which a footbridge gives access to the newer island platforms, numbered 2 and 3, probably to distinguish them from the old platform 1. There is a footpath, with Oyster readers, from Caledonian Road to the entrance.
==Location==
London Buses routes 17, 91, 259, 274 and night route N91 serve the station.

==Services==
The typical off-peak weekday, Saturday and Sunday service at the station in trains per hour is
* 4 westbound to Richmond
* 4 westbound to Clapham Junction
* 8 eastbound to Stratford

<doc id="871012" wikidata="Q334502" url="?curid=871012" title="Bar Kokhba revolt">
<text>The Bar Kokhba revolt () was a large-scale armed rebellion by the Jews of Judaea against the Roman Empire, led by Simon bar Kokhba. It was the third and final major escalation of the Jewish–Roman wars. The revolt began in 132 CE and lasted until 135 or early 136 CE, ending in the total defeat of the short-lived Jewish state. The Romans brutally suppressed the uprising; Bar Kokhba was killed during the siege and fall of Betar, the last Jewish stronghold, in 135 CE. The Roman campaigns led to the near-depopulation of Judea through widespread killings, mass enslavement, and the displacement of many Jews from the region.

Roman rule in Judaea had been deeply resented, especially after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 CE during the First Jewish–Roman War. In its aftermath, the Romans increased their military presence and implemented unpopular changes to the province&#x27;s administrative and economic systems. In 129/130 CE, Emperor Hadrian founded the pagan colony of Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem, extinguishing hopes for the Temple&#x27;s restoration and fueling Jewish anger. The role of the Roman governor Quintus Tineius Rufus in provoking tensions is emphasized in rabbinic literature and by early Christian writers. Additionally, it is possible that a ban on circumcision may have contributed to the rebellion. Bar Kokhba’s charismatic leadership is believed to have played a key role in galvanizing the people.

With the outbreak of the conflict, Jewish rebel forces achieved significant victories, establishing an independent Jewish state that controlled much of the province for several years. Unlike the previous revolt, the rebels were well-prepared, employing guerrilla tactics and utilizing underground tunnels and hiding complexes embedded within their villages. Bar Kokhba was declared &quot;&quot;nasi&quot; (, ) of Israel&quot;, and reportedly had the support of Rabbi Akiva, one of the most revered sages of the time, who identified him as the Messiah. The new state even minted its own coinage and weights. This setback for the Romans led Emperor Hadrian to assemble a large armysix full legions with auxiliaries and other elements from up to six additional legions, all under the command of Sextus Julius Severusand launch an extensive military campaign across Judea, devastating the country. In the revolt&#x27;s final phase, many sought refuge in natural caves, particularly in the Judaean Desert, but Roman troops besieged these hideouts, cutting off supplies and ultimately slaughtering those who were found.

The consequences for the Jewish population were catastrophic. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are estimated to have been killed, with many others sold into slavery or expelled. Judea was heavily depopulated, and the remaining Jews were largely concentrated in Galilee. The defeat had significant religious and philosophical consequences; Jewish messianic beliefs became more abstract and spiritualized, while rabbinical political thought shifted to a more cautious and conservative approach. Judaism and early Christianity continued to diverge more sharply. In addition to the loss of life, the Romans imposed severe religious restrictions, such as prohibitions on circumcision and Shabbat observance. Hadrian continued the construction of Aelia Capitolina, barring Jews from entering the city and its surrounding areas, while bringing in foreign populations and dedicating the city to Jupiter. Finally, the Romans renamed the province of Judea to Syria Palaestina, a measure aimed at obliterating Jewish ties to the land.

==Background==
The Bar Kokhba revolt was the last of three Jewish revolts against Rome fought within a span of approximately 60 years. It was preceded by the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the Diaspora Revolt (115–117 CE). These revolts were brutally suppressed by Rome, resulting in the destruction of numerous Jewish communities, including Jerusalem, the national and religious center of the Jewish people. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed, many others were exiled or sold into slavery, and the status of Jews and Judaism throughout the Roman Empire was significantly diminished.

In 6 CE, Judaea transitioned from a client kingdom of Rome to a directly ruled Roman province. For the next six decades, aside from a brief period under another client king, Herod Agrippa I, the province was governed by successive Roman officials. The Jewish population grew increasingly resentful due to mismanagement, corruption, and the incompetence of these governors. Their rule was often marked by acts of brutality and religious insensitivity, which further inflamed local tensions. Escalating tensions emerged from ethnic, religious, and territorial conflicts with neighboring populations, worsened by widening economic inequalities. Meanwhile, memories of the Maccabean revolt and the period of independence under the Hasmoneans fueled Jewish nationalist aspirations for liberation from Roman rule. In 66 CE, unrest in Caesarea, followed by clashes in Jerusalem, sparked the outbreak of an open Jewish revolt—the First Jewish–Roman War. The rebellion was systematically subdued by the Romans under the command of Vespasian and later his son Titus. Jerusalem was razed, and the Second Temple was destroyed.

Following the war, Judaea underwent administrative reorganization. A senatorial-rank legate was appointed as governor, overseeing the province. Under his command, Legio X Fretensis—which had participated in the war—was permanently stationed in the province, establishing its main base in the ruins of Jerusalem. To further secure the region, the regions of Judea and Idumea were designated as a military zone, administered directly by officers of the legion. The province&#x27;s status changed again in the 110s CE when it was placed under a proconsul, a higher-ranking official. Around this time, an additional legion, Legio VI Ferrata, was stationed in the province, with its main base at Legio (Kefar Othnai). The increased military presence was accompanied by efforts to establish and reinforce a more loyal population in the province, including through the settlement of discharged soldiers.

In 115 CE, during Trajan&#x27;s reign, another large-scale Jewish insurrection, known as the Diaspora Revolt, erupted, spreading across Jewish communities in Egypt, Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia, and continuing until 117. The final stages of this conflict, known as the Kitos War, appear to have led to unrest spilling over into Judaea. Mismanagement of the province in the early 2nd century likely contributed to the conditions that set the stage for the Bar Kokhba revolt, as governors enforcing anti-Jewish policies further destabilized an already volatile region.

== Sources ==

Unlike the First Jewish Revolt, which was thoroughly documented by Josephus—a participant and later eyewitness—the Bar Kokhba revolt is more challenging to reconstruct due to the limited availability of detailed accounts from either Roman or Jewish sources. Researchers rely on limited literary sources with differing objectives, reliability, and dates, leaving many crucial questions unresolved.

The best recognized source for the revolt is Cassius Dio, a Greco-Roman statesman and historian, who described the rebellion in &quot;Roman History&quot; (Book 69). However, Dio&#x27;s account survives only in fragmented form, covering about two pages. It offers an overview of the rebellion&#x27;s general progression and catastrophic outcomes but omits specific names and locations.

Eusebius, a 4th-century Christian bishop and historian from Caesarea, included a concise account of the revolt in his work, &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;. He identified &quot;Bar Chochebas&quot; (interpreted by Eusebius as meaning &quot;star&quot;) as the leader of the Jewish rebels and described their final stronghold at Beththera (i.e., Betar). Though Eusebius lived a century and a half after the revolt and wrote his brief account from a Christian theological perspective, influenced by Supersessionism (the belief that the Church has superseded the Jewish people, assuming their role as God&#x27;s covenanted people) his account provides important details on the revolt and its aftermath in Judea.

The &quot;Historia Augusta,&quot; a late Roman collection of biographies, devotes only a single sentence to the revolt, briefly addressing one of its causes.

Rabbinic literature makes occasional references to the Bar Kokhba revolt, offering insights into its leader, Simon bar Kokhba, and the aftermath of the rebellion, including Roman executions of Jewish leaders and episodes of religious persecution. Only one event—the siege and fall of Betar—is referred to with any detail.

Archaeological discoveries from 1952 onwards, particularly papyrological evidence including legal documents and correspondence between the revolt&#x27;s leader and his subordinates, offer invaluable insights into the Bar Kokhba revolt&#x27;s internal dynamics. Among the roughly 30 surviving documents, three are in Greek, while the others are split between Hebrew and Aramaic. These papyri provide insights into the rebels&#x27; civil administration, army structure, religious practices, and leadership challenges, but do not offer much detail about the course of the war itself. Additional knowledge about the revolt can be gleaned from the coins minted by the rebels, which help to estimate the duration of the uprising and reveal its goals: the establishment of Jewish independence and the rebuilding of the Temple.

== Immediate causes ==
The causes of the Bar Kokhba revolt have been debated among historians, with two main ancient sources providing differing explanations. Cassius Dio attributes the revolt to Jewish anger over Emperor Hadrian&#x27;s decision to rebuild Jerusalem as a Roman colony, Aelia Capitolina. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; suggests that the immediate trigger for the uprising was a Roman ban on circumcision, a central Jewish practice. Despite the differences in these ancient accounts, the prevailing scholarly consensus recognizes a combination of these causes in explaining the outbreak of the revolt.

=== Founding of Aelia Capitolina ===

In 129–130 CE, Hadrian visited Judaea and decided to rebuild Jerusalem, which had been in ruins since its destruction by Titus in 70 CE, as a Roman colony. The city was named Aelia Capitolina, derived from Hadrian&#x27;s family name (Publius Aelius Hadrianus) and in honor of Capitoline Jupiter. According to Cassius Dio:
Eusebius, however, depicted the establishment of a colony as a consequence of the revolt, portraying it as a punitive measure:

Until recently, historians debated whether the foundation of Aelia Capitolina was a cause of the revolt, as depicted by Cassius Dio, or if it occurred afterward as a form of punishment, in line with Eusebius&#x27; account. The discovery of Aelia Capitolina coins struck before the revolt—found in a building abandoned prior to the revolt and in the same hoard as Bar Kokhba revolt coins from refuge caves—has since been widely accepted as evidence supporting the sequence of events that places the founding of the colony before the revolt. These discoveries helped establish Cassius Dio&#x27;s version as the more plausible account, while Eusebius&#x27;s explanation may reflect his supersessionist views.

One interpretation involves the visit in 130 of Hadrian to the ruins of the Temple. At first sympathetic towards the Jews, Hadrian promised to rebuild the Temple, but the Jews felt betrayed when they found out that he intended to build a temple dedicated to Jupiter. A rabbinic version of this story, seemingly set during Hadrian&#x27;s reign, suggests that the Romans did plan to rebuild the Temple, but a malevolent Samaritan convinced them to abandon the idea, claiming that the Jews would rebel once their city was restored. The reference to a malevolent Samaritan, however, is a common motif in Jewish literature. this account might reveal the Jewish sense of disappointment due to the Romans not rebuilding the Temple.

An additional legion, the VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;, arrived in the province to maintain order. Works on Aelia Capitolina commenced in 131. Consul Quintus Tineius Rufus performed the foundation ceremony which involved ploughing over the designated city limits. &quot;Ploughing up the Temple&quot;, seen as a religious offence, turned many Jews against the Roman authorities. The Church Fathers and rabbinic literature emphasize the role of Quintus Tineius Rufus in provoking the revolt. The Romans issued a coin inscribed &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot;.

Mary E. Smallwood writes that the foundation of Aelia Capitolina was likely &quot;an attempt to combat resurgent Jewish nationalism&quot; by secularizing the Jewish holy capital. According to Martin Goodman, Hadrian established the colony as a &quot;final solution for Jewish rebelliousness,&quot; aiming to permanently erase the city and prevent any future rebellion among Jews in Judaea or in diaspora communities, as had occurred under his predecessor. The foundation of a Roman colony—rather than a Hellenistic polis—was designed to transplant foreign populations and impose Roman religious practices. While Hadrian founded many cities, this case was unique in that it was &quot;not to flatter but to suppress the natives.&quot;

=== Ban on circumcision ===
The biography of Hadrian in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, a 4th-century work authored by pagan Roman writers, attributes the Jewish revolt to a prohibition on circumcision, referred to as &quot;mutilare genitalia&quot;—interpreted as a reference to the Jewish practice of &quot;brit milah.&quot; According to the text, &quot;In their impetuosity the Jews also began a war, as they had been forbidden to mutilate their genitals.&quot; However, the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; is considered an unreliable source, and it is unclear whether the prohibition preceded the revolt and caused it, or if the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; has incorrectly reversed the cause-and-effect relationship.

If the prohibition did exist, some scholars speculate that Hadrian, as a Hellenist, may have regarded circumcision as an undesirable form of bodily mutilation. According to E. Mary Smallwood, Hadrian may have instituted a universal prohibition on circumcision, which was later relaxed by his successor, Antoninus Pius, who is known to have granted Jews an exemption. Smallwood also points to two Talmudic passages that suggest the circumcision ban was enacted prior to the revolt, including one from Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus, who authorized the concealment of circumcision knives in times of peril. Scholars such as Peter Schäfer and Joseph Geiger, however, reject the circumcision ban theory, questioning the reliability of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; and instead argue that the ban may have been a punitive measure. Schäfer further argues that Roman laws concerning &quot;genital mutilation&quot; were more likely related to the castration of slaves, not circumcision, thus undermining the link between the ban and the revolt.

=== Other reasons ===
Several elements are believed to have contributed to the rebellion; changes in administrative law, the widespread presence of legally-privileged Roman citizens, alterations in agricultural practice with a shift from landowning to sharecropping, the impact of a possible period of economic decline, and an upsurge of nationalism, the latter influenced by the Diaspora Revolt. The charismatic personality of the revolt&#x27;s leader, Simon bar Kokhba, is also thought to have been a major cause of the revolt.

== Preparations ==
Jewish leaders carefully planned the revolt to avoid the numerous mistakes that had plagued the First Jewish-Roman war, six decades earlier. Cassius Dio reports that:The Jews [...] did not dare try conclusions with the Romans in the open field, but they occupied the advantageous positions in the country and strengthened them with mines and walls, in order that they might have places of refuge whenever they should be hard pressed, and might meet together unobserved underground; and they pierced these subterranean passages from above at intervals to let in air and light.Dio&#x27;s account has been corroborated by the discovery of hundreds of hiding complexes, created in large numbers in almost every populated area. Hideout systems were employed in the Judean hills, the Judean desert, northern Negev, and to some degree also in Galilee, Samaria and Jordan Valley. Many houses utilized underground hideouts, where Judean rebels hoped to withstand Roman superiority by the narrowness of the passages and even ambushes from underground. The cave systems were often interconnected and used as hideouts and for storage and refuge for their families. As of July 2015, some 350 hideout systems have been mapped within the ruins of 140 Jewish villages.

Dio also states that the Jews manufactured their own weapons in preparation for the revolt: &quot;The Jews [...] purposely made of poor quality such weapons as they were called upon to furnish, in order that the Romans might reject them and that they themselves might thus have the use of them.&quot; However, there is no archaeological evidence to support Dio&#x27;s claim that the Jews produced defective weapons. In fact, weapons found at sites controlled by the insurgents are identical to those used by the Romans.

Bethar was selected as the rebels&#x27; headquarters because of its strategic location near Jerusalem, abundant springs, and defensible position. Excavations at the site have revealed fortifications likely built by Bar Kokhba&#x27;s forces, though determining whether these defenses were constructed at the beginning of the revolt or later in the conflict remains unresolved.

== Leadership, organization and administration ==

=== Simon Bar Kokhba ===
The revolt was led by bar Kokhba, a charismatic leader whose support was likely driven by his personal qualities and abilities, including his charisma. According to rabbinic literature, Rabbi Akiva, a leading rabbi, recognized Bar Kokhba as the messiah. However, this claim was contested by other contemporary sages, such as Yohanan ben Torta.Rabbi Aqiba, when he saw Bar-Kozebah, he said this is the king Messiah. Said to him Rabbi Yohanan ben Torta, Aqiba, grass will grow on your cheeks, and the Messiah will not yet have come!&quot;

The name &#x27; does not appear in the Talmud but is found in early ecclesiastical sources. Previously, historians debated whether &#x27;, meaning &quot;son of the star&quot;, was his original name, with some suggesting that the name &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;son of disappointment&quot; or &quot;son of lies&quot; in this interpretation), found in rabbinic texts, was a later, derogatory term. However, documents discovered in the Judaean Desert in the 1950s revealed that his original name was . This name is believed to be derived from his place of origin. The title was likely bestowed upon him by Rabbi Akiva, based on the &quot;Star Prophecy&quot; found in Numbers : &quot;A star () rises from Jacob.&quot;

Seventeen letters discovered in the Judaean desert reveal some details on Bar Kokhba&#x27;s personality.

=== Coinages ===
The new independent state minted its own coins. From the first year of the revolt, there are silver tetradrachms featuring the Temple on the obverse with the word &quot;Jerusalem.&quot; On the reverse, a (palm branch) and (citrus fruit) are depicted, along with the inscription &quot;Year One of the Redemption of Israel.&quot; As in the Hasmonean revolt and the First Jewish–Roman war, Hebrew underwent a resurgence, its presence on coins and documents reinforcing its role as a symbol of Jewish nationhood and independence.

Bar Kokhba, the leader of the revolt, is depicted on the coins as &quot;Simeon, Prince of Israel.&quot; Coins from the first year also feature the inscription &quot;Eleazar the priest,&quot; though the identity of this figure remains uncertain and debated. Bar Kokhba could have been preparing for the Temple&#x27;s eventual reconstruction, appointing a high priest to officiate once it was restored.

For coins from the second year and undated coins, additional inscriptions appear, including &quot;For the Freedom of Israel&quot; and &quot;For the Freedom of Jerusalem.&quot;

=== Geographic extent of the revolt ===
Over the years, two schools formed in the analysis of the revolt. One of them is &quot;maximalists&quot;, who claim that the revolt spread through the entire Judea Province and beyond it into neighboring provinces. The second one is that of the &quot;minimalists&quot;, who restrict the revolt to the area of the Judaean hills and immediate environs. It is generally accepted that the Bar Kokhba revolt encompassed all of Judea, namely the villages of the Judean hills, the Judean desert, and northern parts of the Negev desert. It is not known whether the revolt spread outside of Judea.

Until 1951, Bar Kokhba Revolt coinage was the sole archaeological evidence for dating the revolt. Despite the reference to Jerusalem on the coins, as of early 2000s, archaeological finds, and the lack of revolt coinage found in Jerusalem, supported the view that the revolt did not capture Jerusalem.

In 2020, the fourth Bar Kokhba minted coin and the first inscribed with the word &quot;Jerusalem&quot; was found in Jerusalem Old City excavations. Despite this discovery, the Israel Antiques Authority still maintained the opinion that Jerusalem was not taken by the rebels, because more than 22,000 coins Bar Kokhba coins had been found outside Jerusalem but only four were found within the city. The Israel Antiques Authority&#x27;s archaeologists Moran Hagbi and Dr. Joe Uziel speculated &quot;It is possible that a Roman soldier from the Tenth Legion found the coin during one of the battles across the country and brought it to their camp in Jerusalem as a souvenir.&quot;

Among those findings are the rebel hideout systems in the Galilee, which greatly resemble the Bar Kokhba hideouts in Judea, and though they are less numerous, are nevertheless important. The fact that Galilee retained its Jewish character after the end of the revolt has been taken as an indication by some that either the revolt was never joined by Galilee or that the rebellion was crushed relatively early there compared to Judea.

Several historians, notably W. Eck of the University of Cologne, theorized that the Tel Shalem arch depicted a major battle between Roman armies and Bar Kokhba&#x27;s rebels in Bet Shean valley, thus extending the battle areas some 50 km northwards from Judea. The 2013 discovery of the military camp of Legio VI Ferrata near Tel Megiddo. However, Eck&#x27;s theory on battle in Tel Shalem is rejected by M. Mor, who considers the location implausible given Galilee&#x27;s minimal (if any) participation in the Revolt and distance from the main conflict flareup in Judea proper.

A 2015 archaeological survey in Samaria identified some 40 hideout cave systems from the period, some containing Bar Kokhba&#x27;s minted coins, suggesting that the war raged in Samaria at high intensity.

Jews from Peraea are thought to have taken part in the revolt. This is demonstrated by a destruction layer dating from the early 2nd century at Tel Abu al-Sarbut in the Sukkoth Valley, and by abandonment deposits from the same period that were discovered at al-Mukhayyat and Callirrhoe. There is also evidence for Roman military presence in Perea in the middle of the century, as well as evidence of the settlement of Roman veterans in the area. This view is supported by a destruction layer in Tel Hesban that dates to 130, and a decline in settlement from the Early Roman to the Late Roman periods discovered in the survey of the Iraq al-Amir region. However, it is still unclear whether this decline was caused by the First Jewish–Roman War or the Bar Kokhba revolt. Bowersock suggested of linking the Nabateans to the revolt, claiming &quot;a greater spread of hostilities than had formerly been thought... the extension of the Jewish revolt into northern Transjordan and an additional reason to consider the spread of local support among Safaitic tribes and even at Gerasa.&quot;

=== Foreign participation ===
According to Cassius Dio, the Jewish rebels were aided by &quot;many outside nations,&quot; who were eager &quot;for gain.&quot; Menachem Mor suggests that non-Jewish populations in the region may have indeed joined the revolt alongside the Jews, though their numbers are difficult to assess. These participants likely came from the lower classes in Hellenistic cities, motivated by a desire to undermine the Roman-backed aristocracy and improve their own socio-economic conditions.

==Course of events==

=== Establishment ===
In 132, the revolt, led by Simon bar Kokhba and Elasar, quickly spread from Modi&#x27;in across the country, cutting off the Roman garrison in Jerusalem. After Legio X and Legio VI failed to subdue the rebels, additional reinforcements were dispatched from neighbouring provinces. Gaius Poblicius Marcellus, the legate of Roman Syria, arrived commanding Legio III &quot;Gallica&quot;, while Titus Haterius Nepos, the governor of Roman Arabia, brought Legio III &quot;Cyrenaica&quot;. It is likely that Legio XXII Deiotariana was destroyed during the early stages of the revolt. According to Rabbinic sources some 400,000 men were at the disposal of Bar Kokhba at the peak of the rebellion.

=== Roman campaign ===
Following a series of setbacks, Hadrian called his general Sextus Julius Severus from Britannia, and troops were brought from as far as the Danube. In 133/4, Severus landed in Judea with three legions from Europe (including Legio X &quot;Gemina&quot; and possibly also Legio IX &quot;Hispana&quot;), cohorts of additional legions and between 30 and 50 auxiliary units. The size of the Roman army amassed against the rebels was much larger than that commanded by Titus 60 years earliernearly one third of the Roman army took part in the campaign against Bar Kokhba. It is estimated that forces from at least 10 legions participated in Severus&#x27; campaign in Judea, including Legio X &quot;Fretensis&quot;, Legio VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;, Legio III &quot;Gallica&quot;, Legio III &quot;Cyrenaica&quot;, Legio II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot;, Legio X &quot;Gemina&quot;, cohorts of Legio V &quot;Macedonica&quot;, cohorts of Legio XI &quot;Claudia&quot;, cohorts of Legio XII &quot;Fulminata&quot; and cohorts of Legio IV &quot;Flavia Felix&quot;, along with 30–50 auxiliary units, for a total force of 60,000–120,000 Roman soldiers facing Bar Kokhba&#x27;s rebels. It is plausible that Legio IX &quot;Hispana&quot; was among the legions Severus brought with him from Europe, and that its demise occurred during Severus&#x27; campaign, as its disappearance during the second century is often attributed to this war.

One of the crucial battles of the war took place near Tel Shalem in the Beit She&#x27;an valley, near what is now identified as the legionary camp of Legio VI &quot;Ferrata&quot;. This theory was proposed by Werner Eck in 1999, as part of his general maximalist work which did put the Bar Kokhba revolt as a very prominent event on the course of the Roman Empire&#x27;s history. Next to the camp, archaeologists unearthed the remnants of a triumphal arch, which featured a dedication to Hadrian, most likely referring to the defeat of Bar Kokhba&#x27;s army. Additional finds at Tel Shalem, including a bust of Hadrian, specifically link the site to the period. The theory for a major decisive battle in Tel Shalem implies a significant extension of the area of the rebellion, with Eck suggesting the war encompassed also northern valleys together with Galilee.

=== Fall of Betar ===

After losing many of their strongholds, Bar Kokhba and the remnants of his army withdrew to the fortress of Betar, which subsequently came under siege in the summer of 135. Legio V &quot;Macedonica&quot; and Legio XI &quot;Claudia&quot; are said to have taken part in the siege. According to Jewish tradition, the town was breached and destroyed on Tisha B&#x27;Av, the ninth day of the lunar month of Av, a day of fasting and mourning marking the anniversary of the destruction of the Second Temple.

The Talmudic tradition attributes the downfall of Betar to a Samaritan who acted as a sort of &quot;fifth column,&quot; sowing discord between Bar Kokhba and his maternal uncle, rabbi Elazar Elazar Hamuda&#x27;i. Suspecting Elazar of collaborating with the enemy, Bar Kokhba killed him with a single kick, forfeiting divine protection. Shortly afterward, Betar was captured, and Bar Kokhba was killed. Scholars, however, consider this story to be a later addition with little historical value regarding the revolt. It is thought to reflect the deterioration of relations between Jews and Samaritans in the years following the revolt.

According to a Jewish tradition in Lamentations Rabbah, when Bar Kokhba&#x27;s body was shown to Hadrian, the emperor ordered that the rest of the body be brought forward. It was discovered with a snake coiled around his neck, and Hadrian is said to have commented, &quot;If his God had not slain him, who could have overcome him?&quot; According to another Talmudic legend, found in the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin, Bar Kokhba was executed by the sages, although this account is not considered reliable.

The horrendous scene after the city&#x27;s capture could be best described as a massacre. The Jerusalem Talmud relates that the number of dead in Betar was enormous, and that the Romans &quot;went about slaughtering them until a horse sunk in blood up to its nostrils, and the blood carried away boulders that weighted forty &quot;sela&quot; until it went four miles into the sea. If you should think that it (Betar) was close to the sea, behold, it was forty miles distant from the sea.&quot;

=== Execution of sages ===
According to a rabbinic midrash, the Romans executed eight leading members of the Sanhedrin (the list of Ten Martyrs includes two earlier rabbis): Rabbi Akiva; Haninah ben Teradion; the interpreter of the Sanhedrin, Rabbi Huspith; Eleazar ben Shammua; Hanina ben Hakinai; Jeshbab the Scribe; Judah ben Dama; and Judah ben Bava. The date of Akiva&#x27;s execution is disputed, some dating it to the beginning of the revolt based on the midrash, while others link it to final phases. The rabbinic account describes agonizing tortures: Akiva was flayed with iron combs, Ishmael had the skin of his head pulled off slowly, and Haninah was burned at a stake, with wet wool held by a Torah scroll wrapped around his body to prolong his death.

=== Conclusion ===
Following the fall of Betar, the Roman forces went on a rampage of systematic killing, eliminating all remaining Jewish villages in the region and seeking out the refugees. Legio III &quot;Cyrenaica&quot; was the main force to execute this last phase of the campaign. Historians disagree on the duration of the Roman campaign following the fall of Betar. While some claim further resistance was broken quickly, others argue that pockets of Jewish rebels continued to hide with their families into the winter months of late 135 and possibly even spring 136. By early 136 however, it is clear that the revolt was defeated. The Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 93b) says that Bar Kokhba reigned for a mere two and a half years.

==Aftermath==

=== Destruction and extermination ===
The revolt had catastrophic consequences for the Jewish population in Judaea, with profound loss of life, extensive forced displacements, and widespread enslavement. The scale of suffering surpassed even the aftermath of the First Jewish–Roman War, leaving the region of Judea in a state of desolation. Shimeon Applebaum estimates that about two-thirds of Judaea&#x27;s Jewish population perished in the revolt. Some scholars characterize these consequences as an act of genocide. Describing the devastating consequences of the revolt, several decades after its suppression, the Roman historian Cassius Dio (–235) wrote:

While several scholars, such as Peter Schäfer, have argued that these figures are exaggerations, later estimates suggest that the numbers may be accurate. In 2003, Cotton described Dio&#x27;s figures as highly plausible, given accurate Roman census declarations. In 2021, an ethno-archaeological comparative analysis by Dvir Raviv and Chaim Ben David also supported the accuracy of Dio&#x27;s figures, concluding that his data represent a &quot;reliable account, which he based on contemporaneous documentation.&quot;

Archaeological evidence indicates that many sites in Judea suffered damage, destruction, or abandonment following the Bar Kokhba revolt, to the extent that Jewish settlement in Judea was almost completely eradicated by the end of the revolt. To date, no site in the region has revealed a continuous occupation layer throughout the 2nd century CE. The findings show clear signs of devastation or depopulation within the first few decades of the century, followed by a period of abandonment. When some of these former Jewish settlements were reoccupied in the late 2nd or early 3rd century CE, the new inhabitants were typically non-Jews, as reflected in their distinct material culture, which differed significantly from that of the earlier Jewish population.

=== Expulsion and enslavement ===
Jewish survivors faced harsh punitive measures from the Romans, who often used social engineering to stabilize conflict zones. In the aftermath of the war, Jews were expelled from Jerusalem and its surroundings, including the districts of Gophna, Herodion, and Aqraba. The Romans proceeded with the construction of Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem and barred Jews from entering, except once a year on the day of Tisha B&#x27;Av. According to Jerome, Hadrian &quot;commanded that by a legal decree and ordinances the whole nation should be absolutely prevented from entering from thenceforth even the district round Jerusalem, so that it could not even see from a distance its ancestral home.&quot; Similarly, Jerome writes that Jews were only allowed to visit the city to mourn its ruins, paying for the privilege.Eusebius writes: &quot;[...] all the families of the Jewish nation have suffered pain worthy of wailing and lamentation because God&#x27;s hand has struck them, delivering their mother-city over to strange nations, laying their Temple low, and driving them from their country, to serve their enemies in a hostile land.&quot; Jerome provides a similar account: &quot;in Hadrian&#x27;s reign, when Jerusalem was completely destroyed and the Jewish nation was massacred in large groups at a time, with the result that they were even expelled from the borders of Judaea.&quot;

Roman policy also involved the mass enslavement and deportation of Jewish captives, a practice also observed after the revolt of the Salassi (25 BCE), the wars with the Raeti (15 BCE), and the Pannonian War (c. 12 BCE). William V. Harris estimates that more than 100,000 Jews were enslaved. The slave market was reportedly flooded with Jewish captives, who were sold into slavery and dispersed across the empire, significantly expanding the Jewish diaspora. The 7th-century &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, drawing on earlier sources, states that Hadrian sold Jewish captives &quot;for the price of a daily portion of food for a horse.&quot; Jerome reports that following the war, &quot;innumerable people of diverse ages and both sexes were sold at the marketplace of Terebinthus,&quot; adding that &quot;For this reason it is an accursed thing among the Jews to visit this acclaimed marketplace&quot;. In another work, he notes that thousands were sold there. Those not sold were transported to Gaza for auction, while many others were relocated to Egypt and other regions. Jerome records that Hadrian resettled Jewish captives in the Cimmerian Bosporus. While Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled, a smaller but continuous population remained, with Galilee emerging as its new demographic and religious center. Jewish communities also persisted on the periphery of Judea, in places such as Eleutheropolis, Ein Gedi, and the southern Hebron Hills, as well as on the coastal plain (including Caesarea), Beit She&#x27;an, and the Golan Heights. Some Judean survivors resettled in Galilee and coastal cities, with some rabbinical families gathering in Sepphoris. Galilee subsequently became the intellectual and spiritual hub of Jewish life, where the Mishnah and parts of the Talmud, foundational Jewish texts, were compiled between the 2nd and 4th centuries.

===Roman losses===
Roman casualties were heavy; Legio X &quot;Fretensis&quot; sustained heavy casualties during the revolt, and Legio XXII &quot;Deiotariana&quot; was disbanded following the revolt, perhaps because of serious losses. Cassius Dio writes &quot;Many Romans, moreover, perished in this war. Therefore, Hadrian, in writing to the Senate, did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the emperors: &#x27;If you and your children are in health, it is well; I and the army are in health.&#x27;&quot; Some argue that the exceptional number of preserved Roman veteran diplomas from the late 150s and 160s indicate an unprecedented conscription across the Roman Empire to replenish heavy losses within military legions and auxiliary units between 133 and 135, corresponding to the revolt.

Some historians argue that Legio IX &quot;Hispana&quot;&#x27;s disbandment in the mid-2nd century could have also been a result of this war. Previously it had generally been accepted that the Ninth disappeared around 108 CE, possibly suffering its demise in Britain, according to German historian Theodor Mommsen; but archaeological findings in 2015 from Nijmegen dated to 121 contain the known inscriptions of two senior officers who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in 120 and lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers. It was concluded that the legion was disbanded between 120 and 197, either as a result of fighting the Bar Kokhba revolt, or in Cappadocia (161), or at the Danube (162).

=== Confiscation of lands, colonization and resettlement ===
Eusebius&#x27; reference to the &quot;enslavement&quot; of Jewish territory after the Bar Kokhba revolt suggests that, similar to the measures taken by Vespasian after the First Jewish Revolt, land was returned to imperial ownership. This likely entailed the confiscation of land that had either reverted to Jewish control during the interim between the revolts or had been appropriated by the rebel state. Rabbinic literature mentions &quot;Hadrian&#x27;s vineyard,&quot; a vineyard in Galilee said to stretch from Tiberias to Sepphoris, with its boundaries marked by the bodies of Jews killed at Betar. E. Mary Smallwood suggests that this story may symbolize extensive land confiscations and the establishment of Roman estates in the region following the revolt.

Artistic, epigraphic, and numismatic evidence from post-revolt Judea indicates that the Roman authorities resettled the region with a diverse population. This included Roman veterans and immigrants from the western parts of the empire, who settled in Aelia Capitolina and its surroundings, administrative centers, and along main roads. Additionally, immigrants from the coastal plain and neighboring provinces such as Syria, Phoenicia, and Arabia settled in the Judean countryside. One of the primary beneficiaries of the decline in the Jewish population was the Samaritans. Capitalizing on the depopulation of Jewish areas, they expanded from their historical center in Samaria into northern Judea, the coastal plain, and the Beit She&#x27;an Valley. This expansion is reflected in a saying attributed to Abbahu in the Jerusalem Talmud, according to which thirteen towns were settled by the Samaritans during the period of anti-Jewish persecutions.

In the vicinity of Jerusalem, villages were depopulated, and arable land owned by Jews was confiscated. In the following centuries, the lack of an alternative population to fill the empty villages led Roman and later Byzantine authorities to seek a different approach to benefit the nobles, and ultimately the church, by constructing estate farms and monasteries on the empty village lands. The Roman legionary tomb at Manahat, the ruins of Roman villas at Ein Yael, Khirbet er-Ras, Rephaim Valley and Ramat Rachel, and the Tenth Legion&#x27;s kilns discovered near Giv&#x27;at Ram are all indications that the rural area surrounding Aelia Capitolina underwent a romanization process, with Roman citizens and Roman veterans settling in the area during the Late Roman period. Indications for the settlement of Roman veterans in other parts of Judea proper includes a magnificent marble sarcophagus showing Dionysus discovered in Turmus Ayya, Latin-inscribed stone discovered at Khirbet Tibnah, a statue of Minerva discovered at Khirbat al-Mafjar, a tomb of a centurion at Beit Nattif and a Roman mansion with western elements discovered at Arak el-Khala, near Beit Guvrin.

In Perea, a Roman military presence in the middle of the 2nd century suggests that the Jews there were also victims of the revolt. The name of a Roman veteran from the village of Meason in Perea appears on a papyrus that was signed in Caesarea in 151, implying that lands there had been expropriated and given to Roman settlers. A building inscription of the Sixth Legion from the 2nd century was discovered at as-Salt, which is identified as Gadara, one of the principal Jewish settlements in Perea, and provides more proof of the Roman military presence there.

=== Religious and cultural suppression ===
Following the revolt, Emperor Hadrian enacted a series of religious prohibitions aimed at eradicating Jewish nationalism in Judaea. Torah law and the Hebrew calendar were outlawed, Judaic scholars were executed, and sacred Jewish texts were publicly burned as offerings to Jupiter within the ruins of the Temple complex. At the Temple, he installed two statues, one of Jupiter, another of himself. These measures remained in effect until Hadrian&#x27;s death in 138 CE, after which the surviving Jewish communities experienced some relief, the ban on Jewish entry into Jerusalem remained in place, exempting only those Jews who wished to enter the city for Tisha B&#x27;Av.

This period of persecution left a lasting mark on rabbinic tradition, where it is referred to as &quot;shemad&quot; (; literally &quot;destruction&quot; or &quot;desolation&quot;). Rabbinic texts accompany Hadrian&#x27;s name with the imprecation, &quot;May his bones rot!&quot; The &quot;Tosefta&quot; records Rabbi Ishmael, a 2nd-century sage, drawing a comparison between the destruction of the Temple and Hadrian&#x27;s decrees, which he described as &quot;uprooting the Torah&quot; from among the Jews. 

Hadrian&#x27;s repression targeted Jewish religious leadership, with prominent scholars facing martyrdom for defying his decrees. Rabbi Akiva, one of the most revered figures in rabbinic tradition, was reportedly arrested for studying the Torah and tortured to death with iron combs while reciting the &quot;Shema&quot;, Judaism&#x27;s central declaration of faith. Rabbi Judah ben Baba was executed after ordaining new rabbis in secret, while Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai reportedly went into hiding in a cave with his son for several years to escape execution.

=== Sharp decline of Hebrew language ===
Following the revolt, the Hebrew language disappeared from daily use. Before the revolt, Hebrew was still used as a living language among a very significant part of the Jewish population in this region of the country. In the 3rd century sages no longer knew how to identify the Hebrew names of many plants mentioned in the Mishnah. Only a small number of sages who resided in the south still spoke Hebrew. The Jerusalem Talmud and the classic legend midrashes (in which the majority of the acts and stories are in Aramaic) both demonstrate that Hebrew was used mostly as a literary and artificial language. Hebrew is only found on a small percentage of cemeteries and synagogues.

=== Philosophical and religious consequences ===
Rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative, with Jewish belief in the messiah becoming abstracted and spiritualized.

Doron Mendels suggested that after the revolt, Jewish nationalism in its activist form—meaning large-scale, organized efforts to establish a Jewish state—ceased. However, a passive nationalist sentiment persisted; in rabbinic circles, the aspiration for Jewish sovereignty remained alive, but did not lead to another full-scale revolt or political military movement. David Goodblatt argued that Jewish nationalism did not fall after the revolt, only its political and activist expressions ceased with the loss of Jewish statehood. He noted that Jewish national identity persisted through culture, law, language and religious traditions, even in the absence of a state. While institutions like the Temple, kingship and territorial control declined, they survived in Jewish thought, messianic hopes, and communal memory.

Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that Christians were killed and suffered &quot;all kinds of persecutions&quot; at the hands of rebel Jews when they refused to help Bar Kokhba against the Roman troops. Although Christians regarded Jesus as the Messiah and did not support Bar Kokhba, they were barred from Jerusalem along with the Jews. The outcome of the Bar Kokhba revolt reinforced the Christian interpretation that the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE signified divine punishment, making it a key argument in anti-Jewish polemics.

=== From Judaea to Syria Palaestina ===
A further, more lasting punishment was also implemented by the Romans. In an attempt to erase any memory of Judea or Ancient Israel, the name Judaea was dropped from the provincial name, which was renamed Syria Palaestina. Despite such name changes taking place elsewhere, rebellions have never resulted in a nation&#x27;s name being expunged.

===Later relations between the Jews and the Roman Empire===
Relations between the Jews in the region and the Roman Empire continued to be complicated. Constantine I allowed Jews to mourn their defeat and humiliation annually on Tisha B&#x27;Av at the Western Wall. In 351–352 the Jews of Galilee launched yet another revolt, provoking heavy retribution. The Gallus revolt came during the rising influence of early Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire, under the Constantinian dynasty. In 355, however, the relations with the Roman rulers improved, upon the rise of Emperor Julian, the last of the Constantinian dynasty, who, unlike his predecessors, defied Christianity. In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Sassanian Persia, he ordered the Jewish Temple rebuilt in his effort to foster religions other than Christianity. The failure to rebuild the Temple has mostly been ascribed to the dramatic Galilee earthquake of 363, and traditionally also to the Jews&#x27; ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire, though Christian historians of the time ascribed it to divine intervention. Julian&#x27;s support of Judaism caused Jews to call him &quot;Julian the Hellene&quot;.

In 438, when the Empress Eudocia removed the ban on Jews&#x27; praying at the Temple site, the heads of the community in Galilee issued a call &quot;to the great and mighty people of the Jews&quot; which began: &quot;Know that the end of the exile of our people has come!&quot; However, the Christian population of the city saw this as a threat to their primacy, and a riot erupted which chased Jews from the city.

During the 5th and 6th centuries, a series of Samaritan revolts broke out across Palaestina Prima. Especially violent were the third and the fourth revolts, which resulted in near annihilation of the Samaritan community. It is likely that the Samaritan revolt of 556 was joined by the Jewish community, which had also suffered brutal suppression of their religion under Emperor Justinian. In the belief of restoration to come, in the early 7th century the Jews made an alliance with the Sasanian Empire, joining the invasion of Palaestina Prima in 614 to overwhelm the Byzantine garrison, and briefly gained autonomy in Jerusalem.

==Archaeology==
===Destroyed Jewish villages and fortresses===
Several archaeological excavations have been performed during the 20th and 21st centuries in ruins of Roman-period Jewish villages across Judea and Samaria, as well in the Roman-dominated cities on the coastal plain. Most of the villages in Judea&#x27;s larger region show signs of devastation or abandonment that dates to the Bar Kokhba revolt. Buildings and underground installations carved out beneath or close to towns, such as hiding complexes, burial caves, storage facilities, and field towers, have both been found to have destruction layers and abandonment deposits. Furthermore, there is a gap in settlement above these levels. Fragmentary material from Transjordan and the Galilee adds to the discoveries from Judea.

Excavations at archaeological sites such as Horvat Ethri and Khirbet Badd ‘Isa have demonstrated that these Jewish villages were destroyed in the revolt, and were only resettled by pagan populations in the 3rd century. Discoveries from towns like Gophna, known to be Jewish before the revolt, demonstrate that pagans of Hellenistic and Roman culture lived there during the Late Roman period.

Herodium was excavated by archaeologist Ehud Netzer in the 1980s, publishing results in 1985. According to findings, during the later Bar-Kokhba revolt, complex tunnels were dug, connecting the earlier cisterns with one another. These led from the Herodium fortress to hidden openings, which allowed surprise attacks on Roman units besieging the hill.

The ruins of Betar, the last standing stronghold of Bar Kokhba, can be found at &quot;Khirbet al-Yahud&quot;, an archeological site located in the vicinity of Battir and Beitar Illit. A stone inscription bearing Latin characters and discovered near the site shows that the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion took part in the siege.

===Underground refuges===
There were three categories of underground refuges: man-made &quot;hiding complexes&quot; with living spaces connected by tunnels, &quot;cliff shelters&quot; carved into steep cliff faces, and &quot;natural caves&quot;.

====Hiding complexes====


The Bar Kokhba revolt has been better understood thanks to the discovery of artificially carved hiding complexes under many sites across Judea, and on a lesser level in the Lower Galilee. Their discovery is consistent with Cassius Dio&#x27;s writings, which reported that the rebels used underground networks as part of their tactics to avoid direct confrontations with the Romans. Many were hewn in earlier times and were utilized by rebels during the revolt as indicated by the usage of the coinage produced by Bar Kokhba and other archaeological findings.

Hiding complexes were found at more than 130 archaeological sites in Judea; most of them in the Judaean Lowlands, but also in the Judaean Mountains, and some also in Galilee. Examples include: Hurvat Midras, Tel Goded, Maresha, Aboud and others.

====Cliff shelters and natural caves====


Near the end of the uprising, many Jews fleeing for their life sought asylum in refuge caves, the most of which are found in Israel&#x27;s Judaean Desert on high cliffs overlooking the Dead Sea and the Jordan Valley. The majority of these caves are large natural caverns (with few man-made modifications) that are situated in nearly inaccessible vertical cliffs.

They carried luxury goods, cash, arms, papers and deeds, and even the keys to their homes as a hint that they intended to return there once the fighting was over. These items were frequently discovered with their owners&#x27; bones in caverns, which is evidence of their tragic fate. The Cave of Letters in Nahal Hever and the caverns in Wadi Murabba&#x27;at, which yielded a plethora of written records from the time of the revolt, are among the best-known refuge caves.

The Cave of Letters was surveyed in explorations conducted in 1960–1961, when letters and fragments of papyri were found dating back to the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Cave of Horror is the name given to Cave 8, where the skeletons of 40 Jewish refugees from the Bar Kokhba revolt, including men, women and children, were discovered. Three potsherds with the names of three of the deceased were also found alongside the skeletons in the cave.

The discovery of the Cave of Letters in the Dead Sea area, dubbed as &quot;Bar Kokhba archive&quot;, which contained letters actually written by Bar Kokhba and his followers, has added much new primary source data, indicating among other things that either a pronounced part of the Jewish population spoke only Greek or there was a foreign contingent among Bar Kokhba&#x27;s forces, accounted for by the fact that his military correspondence was, in part, conducted in Greek. The Cave of Horror also contained fragments of letters and writings. Several briefer sources have been uncovered in the area over the past century, including references to the revolt from Nabatea and Roman Syria.

In 2023, archaeologists discovered a cache consisting of four Roman swords and a pilum concealed within a crevice in a cave located within the Ein Gedi nature reserve. Analysis of the sword types and the discovery of a Bar Kokhba revolt coin within the cave strongly support the hypothesis put forth by archaeologists, which suggests that these items were concealed by Jewish rebels during the Bar Kokhba revolt, serving as a precautionary measure to elude detection by Roman authorities.

=== Coinage ===
As of 2023, 24 coins from the Bar Kokhba revolt have been discovered outside of Judaea in various parts of Europe, including what was then the provinces of Britannia, Pannonia, Dacia, and Dalmatia. Most of the coins were discovered near Roman military locations, including multiple legionary and auxiliary camps, though not necessarily in a strict military context. It has been suggested to attribute these findings to Roman soldiers who took part in the uprising and brought the coins as souvenirs or commemorative relics, or to Jewish captives, slaves or immigrants who arrived in those areas in the aftermath of the revolt.

One Baraita contains a rabbinic depiction of a widespread archeological phenomenon: the discovery of hoards of Bar Kokhba coinage all over Judea. The Jews who hid those hoards were unable to collect them due to the presence of Roman garrisons, or because they were killed during the revolt&#x27;s suppression. It is reasonable to believe that the extensive destruction played a part in the loss of the hiding locations as well. Thirty hoards from this era have been found, more than any other decade.

===Roman legionary camps===
A number of locations have been identified with Roman Legionary camps in the time of the Bar Kokhba War, including in Tel Shalem, Jerusalem, Lajjun and more.

====Jerusalem inscription dedicated to Hadrian (129/130)====
In 2014, one half of a Latin inscription was discovered in Jerusalem during excavations near the Damascus Gate. It was identified as the right half of a complete inscription, the other part of which was discovered nearby in the late 19th century and is currently on display in the courtyard of Jerusalem&#x27;s Studium Biblicum Franciscanum Museum. The complete inscription was translated as follows:

To the Imperator Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, son of the deified Traianus Parthicus, grandson of the deified Nerva, high priest, invested with tribunician power for the 14th time, consul for the third time, father of the country (dedicated by) the 10th legion Fretensis Antoniniana.

The inscription was dedicated by Legio X Fretensis to Hadrian in 129/130. The inscription is considered to greatly strengthen the claim that indeed the emperor visited Jerusalem that year, supporting the traditional claim that Hadrian&#x27;s visit was among the main causes of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, and not the other way around.

====Tel Shalem triumphal arc and Hadrian&#x27;s statue====
The location was identified as a Roman military post during the 20th century, with archaeological excavation performed in the late 20th century following an accidental discovery of Hadrian&#x27;s bronze statue in the vicinity of the site in 1975. Remains of a large Roman military camp and fragments of a triumphal arc dedicated to Hadrian were consequently discovered at the site.

== Legacy ==
=== In Rabbinic Judaism ===
The disastrous end of the revolt occasioned major changes in Jewish religious thought. Jewish messianism was abstracted and spiritualized, and rabbinical political thought became deeply cautious and conservative. The Talmud, for instance, refers to Bar Kokhba as &quot;Ben-Kusiba&quot;, a derogatory term used to indicate that he was a false Messiah. The deeply ambivalent rabbinical position regarding Messianism, as expressed most famously in Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Epistle to Yemen,&quot; would seem to have its origins in the attempt to deal with the trauma of a failed Messianic uprising.

=== In Zionism and modern Israel ===
In the post-rabbinical era, the Bar Kokhba Revolt became a symbol of valiant national resistance. The Zionist youth movement Betar took its name from Bar Kokhba&#x27;s traditional last stronghold, and David Ben-Gurion, Israel&#x27;s first prime minister, took his Hebrew last name from one of Bar Kokhba&#x27;s generals.

A popular children&#x27;s song, included in the curriculum of Israeli kindergartens, has the refrain &quot;Bar Kokhba was a Hero/He fought for Liberty,&quot; and its words describe Bar Kokhba as being captured and thrown into a lion&#x27;s den, but managing to escape riding on the lion&#x27;s back.

<text>Sleepover is a 2004 American teen comedy film directed by Joe Nussbaum, in his feature film directorial debut. The film stars Alexa Vega and Mika Boorem with supporting roles from Jane Lynch, Sara Paxton, Brie Larson, Steve Carell and Jeff Garlin.

It was released theatrically in the United States on July 9, 2004, and was both a box office and critical failure upon its release, but has since become a cult classic among fans who viewed the film through the ancillary market in subsequent years.

==Plot==
On the last day of 8th grade before their freshman year in high school, Julie Corky has a slumber party with three friends, Hannah Carlson, Farrah James, and Yancy Williams. A group of popular girls, led by a former friend of Julie&#x27;s, Staci Blake, challenge the girls to a scavenger hunt after Staci&#x27;s boyfriend dumps her. The prize is a coveted lunchtime seat near the fountain in high school, where the popular kids sit. The losers will sit at tables near the school&#x27;s dumpsters.

The list includes things like a picture of the girls with a date inside a nightclub, the insignia from a local private security company, a pair of boxers from Steve Phillips (a boy that Julie has a crush on) and to dress an Old Navy mannequin with their own clothing. After paying her older brother Ren to keep her parents believing that they are still home, the girls sneak out of Julie&#x27;s house, using Yancy&#x27;s father&#x27;s Hypermini to travel to different locations and get the required objects. Along the way they dodge a Patroltec security guard and try to keep Julie&#x27;s parents Gabby and Jay from discovering their absence. At the club, the four sneak in and Julie finds out that her date is her schoolteacher. Understanding her situation, he buys her a drink. Julie drops her scarf, which Gabby who is having a girls night out with a friend, finds at the same club and attempts to call Julie about. When Julie uses a skateboard to go home quickly after the Hypermini gets boxed in traffic, Steve Philips, in his car, sees Julie skateboarding by in a dress and is impressed. Julie arrives home and speaks with her dad, proving to him that she is in fact, at home. Once she speaks to her dad and Ren, who agrees to keep covering for her she leaves and sneaks into Steve&#x27;s house. Steve and his friend are talking about the girl he saw skateboarding and looking through an old yearbook figures out it was Julie. Julie, who is in his house narrowly escapes him in the bathroom, before grabbing his boxers and leaving. The other girls meanwhile try to find a way to charge their car, and Staci and her team alert Patroltec about a suspicious person at Steve&#x27;s house. Finally before running away they grab the Patroltec insignia on the security guard&#x27;s car. Later the girls meet up at the school dance, but both groups have obtained all listed items.

Staci suggests a tiebreaker, where the group which is able to get the crown from the king or queen of the dance will win. Staci catches her boyfriend, Todd, dancing with and kissing another girl who claims that she has been Todd&#x27;s girlfriend for six months. After the two break up, Staci shares a dance with a scruffy skater friend of Julie&#x27;s, Russell. Russell drops his copy of the scavenger hunt list, which Steve finds. Russell and Staci end up winning the dance contest causing a fight between Todd and his girlfriend. Steve ends up named homecoming king and picks Julie as his partner for a victory dance, giving her the crown and ensuring victory for her friends.

After the dance, Julie and Steve are about to kiss when Ren calls and notifies her that Gabby is headed home. The girls drive home where Julie drops the crown. They make it home at the same time as Gabby and narrowly miss being caught sneaking in. They pretend to be sleeping just as Julie&#x27;s parents check on them. The next morning at breakfast, Gabby confronts her asking &quot;exactly&quot; what they did last night, showing Julie the scarf she had dropped in the Cosmo club. Surprisingly, she is not mad but confesses her amazement at how fast Julie is maturing. After she says goodbye to her friends, Julie finds Steve waiting inside her tree fort with her lost crown, where the two finally share a kiss. The film ends with a scene of Staci and her friends, now in high school, eating their lunch by the school dumpsters among the trash and the social rejects.

<doc id="871018" wikidata="Q6959416" url="?curid=871018" title="Nahuatl orthography">
<text>Since the early 16th century, Nahuatl has been written in an orthography in Latin script based on Spanish spelling conventions, with overall the same values for letters in both orthographies. Over the centuries, Latin script was utilized to record a large body of Nahuatl prose and poetry, which somewhat mitigated the devastating loss of the thousands of Aztec manuscripts that were burned by Spanish missionaries.

Printed and manuscript texts in Nahuatl generally display a lot of orthographical variety, as there was no official institution that developed and promoted a standard. The spelling as used in ecclesiastical circles between 1570 and 1650 showed the highest degree of stability, and this spelling, and the language variety written in it, are considered &quot;classical&quot;.

A new orthography was introduced in 1950 in the weekly magazine &quot;Mexicatl Itonalama&quot;. This orthography is currently used to write some of the modern Nahuatl dialects.

==Periodisation==
The development of Nahuatl orthography was analyzed and described by the American historian and linguist James Lockhart. He divides the development of Nahuatl orthography into three stages:

*Stage 1, the early stage of experimentation, characterised by much variety in the representation of some phonemes; for example, &quot;and, also&quot; can be written as ihuan, yhuan, iuan, juan, yuan, ivan, jvan, yvan, ihoan, jhuan, yhoan, ioan, joan or yoan.
*Stage 2, starting around 1570 when a more or less standardised orthography emerged, which showed &quot;great stability as practiced in ecclesiastical circles&quot;; this stage is considered the classical period of Nahuatl.
*Stage 3, from 1650 onward, which saw the production of large amounts of &quot;mundane&quot; (i.e. non-religious or ecclesiastical) texts by native scribes.

==Classical Nahuatl orthography==
The standard or &quot;classical&quot; orthography was established in the second half of the 16th century. It represents the phonemes of Nahuatl as follows.

===Vowels===
The four vowels are written , , , . The phonemic contrast between short and long vowels is left unmarked.

===Consonants===
The stops and , the nasals and , and the approximants and are written in a straighforward manner (the right-hand column shows the spelling in syllable-final position):

The nasal becomes before a labial consonant, and may then be written . Conversely, the nasal becomes before a dental consonant, and is then written . In addition, both and are realised as before alveopalatal consonants, and as before velars; they are then written , as in &quot;he&#x27;s going to do it&quot;, &quot;he sleeps too late&quot;.

The spelling represents geminated , not palatal or as in Spanish; for example, &quot;house&quot; is , not *.

The semivowel does not occur in syllable-final position, where it changes to or .

The affricates and and the approximant are written with the digraphs , , and :

The does not occur before the vowel , so the spelling does not exist. Syllable-final is most often written with the digraph reversed to , as in &quot;sand, dust&quot;.

As in Spanish, the stop is written before and syllable-finally, and before . Labialized is written before , while before and it is written , since is used to write plain before ; thus &quot;they ate it&quot;.

Labialized does not occur before , hence the spellings or do not exist. Syllable-final is most often written , but it can also be written or , as in , or &quot;lord&quot;.

The spelling seemingly contains the digraph , which is used to write , but in fact represents the pronunciations (syllable-final followed by , as in &quot;I&#x27;m coming to see it&quot;. The spelling is thus distinct from , while is spelled as in &quot;fisherman&quot;.

The dental fricative is written before , before , and syllable-finally. The affricate is written in all positions, and the palatal fricative is written in all positions.

The choice for , and to represent instead of simple was dictated by the pronunciation of Spanish sibilants in the 16th century, which was different from modern pronunciation. At that time the graph , as used in Spanish orthography, represented an apico-alveolar sibilant, which was perceived by speakers of Nahuatl as being close to . The graphs (before ), (before ) and on the other hand represented a dental sibilant in 16th-century Spanish, and were therefore adopted in Nahuatl orthography to write dental .

The letter represented in 16th-century Spanish as well. Thus the name of Cervantes’ famous fictional character was pronounced and written as in the 16th century, with the letter representing .

The letters , , , , , , , and are not needed for the writing of native Nahuatl words, but they can be used in the spelling of Spanish loanwords. However, the spelling of loanwords often reflects their (complete or partial) assimilation to Nahuatl phonology, for example from Spanish &quot;councilman&quot; 

===Vowel length and glottal stop===
In most classical Nahuatl texts, printed as well as manuscript, short and long vowels are not distinguished, and the glottal stop or &quot;saltillo&quot; is not represented. This underrepresentation apparently did not seriously affect legibility.

In his (1645), the priest and grammarian Horacio Carochi aimed to provide a full representation of all phonemically relevant features of Nahuatl. He therefore used the macron to mark long vowels (, , , ), for example &quot;little bird&quot;. He also marked the presence of word-internal glottal stop with a grave accent on the preceding vowel letter (, , , ), and word-final glottal stop with a circumflex on the preceding vowel letter (, , , ), for example &quot;scribe, painter&quot;. Since long vowels do not occur before glottal stop, the &quot;stacking&quot; of two diacritics on a vowel letter was not necessary.

Carochi&#x27;s innovations were subsequently used by some fellow-Jesuit authors, but they never gained wide currency. The French linguist Michel Launey used Carochi&#x27;s notation of glottal stop in his grammars (1994, 2011) and other publications.

Word-internal glottal stop was occasionally written with the letter , notably by the 16th-century lexicographer Alonso de Molina, for example &quot;by day&quot;. Although this was never done consistently, Lockhart notes that writing as was &quot;perennial&quot; and &quot;the tradition of it never entirely disappeared&quot;.

==Post-classical orthography==
As before, in post-classical orthography vowel length was never marked, and glottal stop was written only sporadically (as h).

The &quot;single most substantial change&quot; was the replacement, starting around 1650, of c (before e and i), ç and z by s. This change was inspired by the merger of the Spanish apico-alveolar sibilant (written &quot;s&quot;) with the dental sibilant, and by the beginning of the 18th century the use of s had become the norm, as in totlasomahuisnantzin for classical totlaçomahuiznantzin &quot;our precious revered mother&quot;. The digraph tz for remained unchanged.

With that, the orthography of post-classical texts shows growing instability, mainly through the influence of dialectal (non-classical) varieties of the language. One source of instability was the disappearance in some varieties of spoken Nahuatl of some syllable-final consonants, in particular , which was reflected in the orthography. Other orthographical variants, encountered in all three stages, are:

*geminated consonants written as a single consonants
*i written y, especially in word-initial position
*o written u
*hu written u, ho or o
*ce and ci written çe, çi (matching ça and ço )

==“Neoclassical” orthography==
Since the 1970s, linguists working on Nahuatl have made use of what may be termed a &quot;neoclassical&quot; orthography for the language. This orthography is closely modelled on the classical (Stage 2) spelling as described above, but with the following adaptations:

*following Carochi, long vowels are always marked with a macron: classical a, e, i, o &gt; neoclassical a/ā, e/ē, i/ī, o/ō
* syllable-final glottal stop is always written h, for example classical tlacuilo &gt; neoclassical tlahcuiloh ; the use of h is based on historical precedent, and lends the glottal stop more &quot;body&quot; than the diacritics used by Carochi
*syllable-final is always written uc, for example classical tecuhtli, tecutli or teuctli &gt; neoclassical tēuctli &quot;lord&quot;.

Also, a few classical spelling conventions are brought into line with the current standardised Spanish orthography:

* ça and ço are replaced with za and zo, for example classical çacatl &quot;grass, hay&quot;, çoquitl &quot;clay, mud&quot; &gt; neoclassical zacatl, zoquitl 
* qua is replaced with cua, for example classical quaquauhconetl &quot;calf&quot; &gt; neoclassical cuācuauhconētl.

The neoclassical spelling of Nahuatl provides a full written representation of all phonologically relevant facts. It is employed in two central reference tools in modern Nahuatl studies, Andrews&#x27; &quot;Introduction to Classical Nahuatl&quot; (1975, revised edition 2003), and Karttunen&#x27;s &quot;Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl&quot; (1983). It is also often used for the transcription of Nahuatl terms in non-linguistic disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, and history.

It has to be borne in mind however that the neoclassical spelling is a modern construct, which does not exactly reproduce any of the actual orthographies that were used in historical printed and manuscript sources.

Overview of the neoclassical orthography:

Glottal stop occurs frequently in syllable-final position, and very rarely between like vowels in forms that resulted from reduplication. It is then also written h, as in ehēcatl &quot;wind&quot;, ohōme &quot;two by two&quot;; cf. classical eecatl and oome.

The neoclassical spelling does not regulate the spelling of Spanish loanwords, because &quot;loanwords exist in the language in all stages of assimilation to the phonology of the language (…). As a result, it is rather meaningless to assign canonical forms to them, existing as they do in transit from one language to the other.&quot;

==The new orthography==
A new orthography was introduced in 1950 in the weekly cultural magazine &quot;Mexihkatl Itonalama&quot;, published by the American linguist Robert H. Barlow (director), and the Mexican linguist and native speaker Miguel Barrios Espinosa (editor-in-chief). The frontpage of the first issue of 12 May 1950 carries the headline ININ TOTLAHTOL OKSE: TLEKA TIKIHKWILOSKEH KEMEN KAXTILLAN? &quot;This language of ours is a different one: why should we write it as if it were Spanish?&quot;

Compared to classical Nahuatl spelling as described above, the new orthography as proposed and used in &quot;Mexihkatl Itonalama&quot; contains the following changes:

* is written s instead of c/ç/z
* is written ts instead of tz
* is written k instead of c/qu
* is written kw instead of qu/cu/uc 
* is written w instead of hu/uh
* is written h

The new orthography thus does away with all almost all the typically Spanish spelling conventions of the classical orthography. The exception is the digraph ch , which was kept, but which could have been replaced with tx.

The new orthography does not mark the vowel length contrast, which has been lost in most modern dialects.

Overview of the new orthography:

This new orthography, now usually named the &quot;modern orthography&quot; (), is used for the writing of some modern dialects, sometimes with the alternative spellings ku for kw, and u for w. Also, long vowels can be written with double symbols aa, ee, ii, oo, and fricative , which occurs in some dialects as the reflex of original glottal stop, may be written j.

The new or modern orthography is promoted by the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP), a federal government authority, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;the modern orthography of the SEP&quot; (&quot;la ortografía moderna de SEP&quot;), with some websites wrongly stating that it was designed by SEP experts.

The new or modern orthography has not yet succeeded in becoming the dominant system, and some dialects such as Huasteca are now written in several competing orthographies (neoclassical, modern, and the mixed orthography employed by SIL international).

<text>The Liberal People&#x27;s Party (, DLF) was a classical liberal Norwegian political party created in 1992 by some of the members of the old Liberal People&#x27;s Party.

In 2017, during the last national convention the party decided to close down. And encouraged its members to join the Foreningen for Studium av Objektivismen and the Liberalistene.

==History==

During the 1990s, some of the Progress Party&#x27;s members considered the party to have become less liberal than it had been in its earlier days. These members of the Progress Party then decided to join the DLF. The DLF then took increasingly more classically liberal viewpoints on most issues, emerging as a promoter of economic liberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. The party&#x27;s politics states that the state should only protect individuals&#x27; rights through police, courts of law and a military service.

The party&#x27;s parliament election results are as follows: 

In 1993, the party won 725 votes 0.03%

In 1997, the party won 258 votes 0.01%

In 2001, the party won 166 votes 0.01% 

In 2005, the party won 213 votes 0.01%

In 2009, the party won 350 votes 0.01% 

In 2013, the party won 909 votes 0.03% the best results in the party’s history 

In 2017, the party did not run. This was because the party dissolved at the end of 2017. 

The party&#x27;s local election results are as follows: 

In 1995, the party did not run 

In 1999, the party did not run 

In 2003, the party got 113 votes 0.01%

In 2007, the party got 127 votes 0.01%

In 2011, the party got 247 votes 0.01% all in Oslo

In 2015, the party did not run

In 2014, the youth wing Liberalistisk Ungdom (Liberal Youth) seceded from the DLF and joined the Capitalist Party as their youth wing.

In 2017, the party congress decided to shut down the party by the end of the year. Followers were recommended to join the Union for the Study of Objectivism and the Capitalist Party.

==Objectives==
DLF wanted to:
* Replace the parliamentary system and the monarchy with a constitutional republic.
* Abolish coercive taxes.
* Abolish all current restrictions regarding trade between Norway and other nations. Viewing the EU as a social democratic, redistributive and protectionist organization, they opposed Norwegian membership.
* Simplify laws, end bureaucracy, decriminalize victimless crimes, and so forth.
* Privatize roads, highways, railroads and other infrastructure, leaving their construction and upkeep to the free market.
* Abolish state financing of: special interest groups, business and industry, the agricultural and fishing sectors, the unemployed, and so forth.
* Abolish restrictions on immigration, provided that the above is accomplished beforehand.
* Abolish mandatory military service, instead relying on a fully professional defence force.
* Complete the separation of church and state.

==Party leaders==
* 1992–1995 Tor Ingar Østerud
* 1995–1997 Runar Henriksen
* 1997–2001 Trond Johansen
* 2001–2003 Arne Lidwin
* 2003–2017 Vegard Martinsen

<text>Helsinki metropolitan area (, ) or Greater Helsinki (, ) is the metropolitan area around Helsinki, the capital city of Finland. It also includes the smaller capital region. The terms Helsinki metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki, Capital region and the other terms used are not fixed and may vary in different contexts.

The metropolitan region is the largest urbanised area in the country with a population of approximately million () and is by far the most important economic, cultural, and scientific region of Finland. Five of Finland&#x27;s 14 universities, and six universities of applied sciences are located in the metropolitan area, as are most of the headquarters of major companies and government institutions. Finland&#x27;s main airline hub and airport, Helsinki Airport, is located in the city of Vantaa.

These regions are located in the south of Finland, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, which is a part of the Baltic Sea. They are also a part of the region of Uusimaa in Finland.

==Terminology==

===Capital Region===

In the strictest sense, the Finnish capital region consists of four municipalities with city title, Helsinki, Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen. It has a population of about million. This area is most often called the &quot;Capital region&quot; in English, &quot;Pääkaupunkiseutu&quot; in Finnish, and &quot;Huvudstadsregionen&quot; in Swedish, although the use of the terms is not especially consistent. The vast majority of the inhabitants live in the urban areas of the cities, but within the boundaries of these cities there are also suburban and rural areas.

=== Helsinki metropolitan area ===
The Helsinki metropolitan area includes around ten additional municipalities that can be considered commuter towns and exurbs of Helsinki. These municipalities are Hyvinkää, Järvenpää, Kerava, Kirkkonummi, Nurmijärvi, Sipoo, Tuusula, Mäntsälä, Pornainen and Vihti, bringing the total population to about  million. All of the municipalities belong to the region of Uusimaa. Of these, Järvenpää, Kerava, Tuusula, Nurmijärvi, Sipoo, Kirkkonummi, Mäntsälä and Vihti have parts of the urban area within them. Additionally, the cities of Porvoo, Lohja, Karkkila and to some extent Riihimäki, which have very close ties, motorway and, in the case of Riihimäki, commuter train accesses, and are fairly close to the capital, are nowadays often included in regional planning, which raises the total population to about  million.

=== Helsinki sub-region ===

Helsinki metropolitan area differs from the Helsinki sub-region (), which also includes the municipalities of Karkkila, Lohja and Siuntio. The Helsinki sub-region is used for statistical purposes. It is based on cooperation between municipalities and the commuting area. The sub-region has a population of about million.

=== Helsinki Region Cooperation Assembly ===

The Helsinki Region Cooperation Assembly is a cooperative body of the municipalities of the Helsinki Region, whose members are the leading elected representatives of the municipalities. Seventeen municipalities participate in cooperation in the Helsinki Region:

* Cities in the Helsinki Capital Area: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen.
* The &quot;KUUMA municipalities&quot;: Järvenpää, Nurmijärvi, Tuusula, Kerava, Mäntsälä, Pornainen, Hyvinkää, Kirkkonummi, Vihti and Sipoo.
* Partnership municipalities: Porvoo, Lohja and Siuntio.

The common goal of the participating municipalities is to develop cooperation and advocacy. The cooperation is based on the common vision of the municipalities in the Helsinki region regarding the challenges facing the region and the common will to contribute to the development of the region.

===Other definitions===
As a part of the urban audit project, Eurostat has attempted to standardise the concept of a &#x27;metropolitan area&#x27;. According to this study the Metropolitan area of Helsinki consists of the kernel of Helsinki: Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa, and Kauniainen. The Helsinki Larger Urban Area (&quot;Helsingin seutu&quot; in Finnish) consists of 12 cities and municipalities: the kernel of Helsinki and the aforementioned eight municipalities.

Statistics Finland define the commuter belt of Helsinki (&quot;Helsingin työssäkäyntialue&quot;, &quot;Helsingfors pendlingsområde&quot;) to include a total of 27 municipalities and a population of  million. In addition to that, there are people from as far as Lahti and even Tampere commuting to Helsinki daily.

Statistics Finland also defines the Helsinki urban area according to the official Finnish definition of an urban area ( in Finnish). Urban areas in Finland are defined as inhabited areas of at least 200 people with a maximum distance of between buildings. The Helsinki urban area is the largest of its kind in Finland, and encompasses land throughout metropolitan area, with notable gaps around forests and other less-densely populated areas.

The commuter towns of Lohja and Porvoo are not usually included to the Helsinki metropolitan area, though, if they were (considering their proximity to Helsinki and their high commuting rate), they would raise the overall population almost two million people. Hyvinkää, Järvenpää, Nurmijärvi, Tuusula, Mäntsälä and Pornainen, which have been designated as municipalities in Central Uusimaa in recent decades, have shown clear population growth due to their urban but also loose rural environment. These are also known as the &quot;KUUMA municipalities&quot;.

==Municipalities==

== Economy ==
In 2020, Helsinki&#x27;s gross metropolitan product was valued at €94.2 billion (US$100 billion). This puts Helsinki in 23rd place among metropolitan regions in the European Union.

<text>Yootha Joyce Needham (20 August 1927 – 24 August 1980), known as Yootha Joyce, was an English actress best known for playing Mildred Roper opposite Brian Murphy in the sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot; (1973–1976) and its spin-off &quot;George and Mildred&quot; (1976–1979).

==Early life==
Yootha Joyce Needham was born in Wandsworth, London, the only child of musical parents Percival &quot;Hurst&quot; Needham, a singer, and Jessie Maud (née Revitt), a concert pianist. She was named &quot;Yootha&quot; after a New Zealand dancer in her father&#x27;s touring company, a name she would later say she &quot;loathed and detested&quot;. Joyce&#x27;s biography states that her heavily pregnant mother went for a walk on Wandsworth Common during an interval of one of her husband&#x27;s performances and began feeling contractions; searching for a house to call an ambulance, she came across a nursing home where she gave birth.

The family lived in a basement flat at Bennerley Road, Wandsworth, although Joyce spent much time living with her maternal grandmother, Jessie Rebecca Revitt, while her parents were touring. Initially educated at the Battersea Central Co-educational School, Joyce was evacuated at the start of the Second World War to Petersfield, Hampshire, where she attended Petersfield County High School for Girls. Although Joyce later said that she &quot;hated&quot; her time in Petersfield, she and the other female evacuees from Battersea would use the local church hall there for acting, dancing and singing. By the time Joyce returned to London in 1941 her parents resided on Gladstone Road in Croydon, joined by her grandmother. She completed her education at Croydon High School.

Joyce&#x27;s family were not encouraging of her career. She could not sing or play the piano like her parents, who stated she &quot;wasn&#x27;t much good at anything&quot;; however, inspired by her performances at Petersfield, Joyce became determined to &quot;break family tradition [...] and become a straight dramatic actress&quot;. Despite her parents&#x27; disdain, Joyce successfully auditioned for a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), beginning in September 1944, alongside Roger Moore. Her first performance was playing Lydia Bennet in a production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Undeterred by her director saying that she &quot;had nothing to offer the profession&quot;, Joyce began working as an assistant stage manager at The Grand in Croydon during the summer holidays, and joined a repertory company where she starred in productions including &quot;Escape Me Never&quot; and &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot;. Starting back at RADA in September 1945, Joyce dropped the &quot;Needham&quot; from her name and began using the stage name &quot;Yootha Joyce&quot; saying &quot;it seemed less of a mouthful... being stuck with Yootha is enough&quot;. Joyce left RADA in early 1946, finding it unduly strict and unencouraging.

==Career==
Following her departure from RADA, Joyce toured the UK in many repertory theatre groups, including the Harry Kendall Players, the Reginald Salberg Players, the Jack Rose Players and the Harry Hanson Players, and received many positive reviews of her performances. In 1955, following a dry period of work, Joyce applied for work at a further repertory group based at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in a production entitled &quot;The Call of the Flesh&quot;. The producer, Glynn Edwards accepted her audition and the two became good friends, and later lovers. Touring the UK in &quot;The Call of the Flesh&quot; the play was billed as &quot;daring&quot;, &quot;naked&quot;, &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;gripping&quot; and was a huge success. The theatre director Joan Littlewood was in the audience at one of the performances and was impressed to the extent that she asked Edwards to join her Theatre Workshop at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East.

By 1956, Joyce and Edwards had moved in together and rented a flat in Hampstead. During one of Littlewood&#x27;s productions, Littlewood began looking for more female parts and Edwards suggested Joyce. She joined the production and became a member of the Theatre Workshop alongside other contemporaries including Barbara Windsor, Murray Melvin, Victor Spinetti, Bob Grant, Stephen Lewis, and Brian Murphy. Joyce married Edwards on 8 December 1956. She would confide in Edwards that her greatest fear was being without work, and that she thought every job she had would be her last. Although she appeared in a large number of Littlewood&#x27;s productions, Joyce first came to prominence in &quot;Fings Ain&#x27;t Wot They Used T&#x27;Be&quot;. Joyce made her first television appearance in 1962 in an episode of &quot;Brothers in Law&quot;, a sitcom about a young lawyer, alongside a young Richard Briers, and went on to make her film debut in Littlewood&#x27;s film &quot;Sparrows Can&#x27;t Sing&quot; (1963). Joyce and Edwards divorced in 1969 but remained close friends, to the extent that she used to console him after his subsequent relationships broke down.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Joyce became a familiar face in many one-off sitcom roles and supporting parts in films, with her first main recurring role being Miss Argyll, frustrated girlfriend of the star Milo O&#x27;Shea, in three series of &quot;Me Mammy&quot; (1968–71); most of the episodes of that series are lost. Prior to that, she played a cameo role in Jack Clayton&#x27;s &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964) as a psychotic young woman opposite Anne Bancroft, delivering a performance that has been called one of the &quot;best screen acting miniatures one could hope to see.&quot; She also had a featured role (as brassy housekeeper Mrs Quayle) in Clayton&#x27;s next film &quot;Our Mother&#x27;s House&quot; (1967), a dark drama starring Dirk Bogarde, which dealt with a group of young children who conceal the death of their single mother to prevent being split up. She also appeared in the Hammer Horror film &quot;Fanatic&quot; (1965) as a villain. Joyce used her talent for playing villains in television series such as &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Jason King&quot;.

Her talent for comedy was also used to good effect in programmes such as &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;On the Buses&quot;. She made appearances in the films &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; (1965), &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1966) and &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1967), as well as TV spin-off films &quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot; (1972), &quot;Never Mind the Quality Feel the Width&quot; (1973) and &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973). She also appeared as customer Mrs. Scully in the pilot episode of &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (1973).

==Mildred Roper==
It was not until 1973 that Joyce acquired a starring role, when she was cast as man-hungry Mildred Roper, wife of sub-letting landlord George, in the sitcom &quot;Man About the House&quot;. This series, which starred Richard O&#x27;Sullivan, Paula Wilcox, Sally Thomsett and Brian Murphy as George Roper, ran until 1976, deriving its comic narrative from two young women and a young man sharing the flat above the Ropers.

When the series ended, a spin-off was written that featured the Ropers: &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1976. The couple were seen moving from the London house in Myddleton Terrace in the previous programme, and into a newer suburban property in Peacock Crescent, Hampton Wick. Much of the new series centred on Mildred&#x27;s desire to better herself in her new surroundings, but always being thwarted, usually unwittingly, by her ineffectual husband&#x27;s desire for a quiet life.

==Final years and death==
Joyce was affected by her long-term alcoholism.

A feature film version of &quot;George and Mildred&quot; (1980) was her last work. Amidst growing concern over her health, she was admitted to hospital in the summer of 1980. Joyce died in hospital of liver failure four days after her 53rd birthday on 24 August 1980. Her co-star and good friend Brian Murphy was at her bedside. Joyce&#x27;s funeral took place on 3 September 1980 at Golders Green Crematorium, where she was cremated. Her ashes were scattered on the crocus lawn in the grounds of the crematorium.

At the inquest into Joyce&#x27;s death, it was revealed that she had been drinking up to half a bottle of brandy a day for ten years and recently very much more, and that she had, in the words of her lawyer Mario Uziell-Hamilton, become a victim of her own success, and dreaded the thought of being typecast as Mildred Roper. The pathologist stated that Joyce&#x27;s liver was twice the normal size and that her heart and lungs had also suffered because of her drinking; Joyce&#x27;s cause of death was given as portal cirrhosis of the liver. Joyce&#x27;s biography implies that she turned to drink to steady her nerves, particularly after her divorce and subsequent failed relationships, loneliness, typecasting, lack of other work, and lack of privacy due to the popularity of Mildred Roper, and had become depressed.

Joyce appeared posthumously in her last recorded television performance, duetting with Max Bygraves on his variety show &quot;Max&quot;, singing &quot;For All We Know&quot;. The episode was aired on 14 January 1981. Actor and comedian Kenneth Williams wrote in his diary of the performance that &quot;she looked as though she was crying... as she got up [and left the set] one had the feeling she never intended to return.&quot; He also went on to mention her in a later entry in his diary (9 April 1988, just days before his own death) that &quot;there was a break in her voice when she got to [the line] tomorrow may never come... she was a lady who made so many people happy and a lady who never complained&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1986, The Smiths used an image of Joyce on the sleeve of their UK single release &quot;Ask&quot; and the German release of &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others&quot;, thereby adding her to what would become a significant set of musical releases, made iconic by their design (other Smiths &#x27;cover stars&#x27; included Truman Capote, Alain Delon, Terence Stamp, Elvis Presley, Pat Phoenix, Viv Nicholson, Billie Whitelaw and Shelagh Delaney).

In October 2001, a tribute documentary entitled &quot;The Unforgettable Yootha Joyce&quot; was broadcast by ITV, which featured Glynn Edwards as well as many of her co-stars and friends, including Sally Thomsett, Brian Murphy, Nicholas Bond-Owen and Norman Eshley, talking about memories and their relationships with Joyce.

In 2014, a biography was written by Paul Curran, entitled &quot;Dear Yootha... The Life of Yootha Joyce&quot;, to which contributions were made by those who knew and worked with her, including Glynn Edwards, Murray Melvin and Barbara Windsor. Curran also published &quot;The Yootha Joyce Scrapbook&quot; containing rare and unseen photographs detailing events from Joyce&#x27;s life in 2015 and released a third book entitled &quot;Yootha Joyce: Pieces of a Life&quot; in 2021.

In 2019, a one-woman play depicting Joyce&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Testament of Yootha&quot;, was performed by Caroline Burns-Cooke at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

<text>Beverlywood is a neighborhood in the Westside of the city of Los Angeles, California.
==History==
Beverlywood was developed in 1940 by Walter H. Leimert, who also developed Leimert Park. The neighborhood consists of 1,354 single family homes, and was one of the first neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area to have binding CC&amp;Rs. These regulations, which are administered by the Beverlywood Homes Association, strictly limit housing size, style, color, and design along with additional restrictions on landscaping, and are enforced by a review committee. Additionally, all residents are required to pay the fees to the Beverlywood Home Association.

In recent years, the neighborhood has become a hotspot for mansionization. Despite complying with HOA regulations, many residents believe that the newer and larger houses ruin the feel of the neighborhood and have been successfully campaigning the Los Angeles City Council for regulations to restrict new home sizes.

==Geography==

===Beverlywood Homes Association===

According to the Beverlywood Homes Association, the borders of the Beverlywood are: Monte Mar Drive to the north, Robertson Boulevard to the east, Hillcrest Country Club and Anchor Avenue to the west, and Beverlywood Street to the south. These borders are marked by entrance monuments and signs.

Beverlywood is flanked east by Crestview, La Cienega Heights, and Reynier Village; on the south by Castle Heights; and on the west by Cheviot Hills.

===Los Angeles Times===

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;overzealous real estate agents sometimes stretch the true boundaries of Beverlywood&quot;. 

The &quot;Times&quot; reported that the borders of the neighborhood are: Monte Mar Street on the north, Robertson Boulevard on the east, Beverwil and Roxbury Drives on the west, and Beverlywood Street on the south. 

The &quot;Times&quot; also noted that the entrances to the neighborhood are clearly marked with Beverlywood signs.

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 6,080 residents in the 0.79-square-mile Beverlywood neighborhood—an average of 7,654 people per square mile, about average for the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 6,418. The median age for residents was 39, older than the city at large; the percentages of residents aged 35 to 49 and 65 and older were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;not especially diverse&quot; ethnically, with a high percentage of white people. The breakdown was whites*, 80%; Asians, 7.3%; Latinos, 6.1%; blacks, 4.2%; and others, 2.4%. *Iran (12.1%) and *Israel (9.3%) were the most common places of birth for the 24.5% of the residents who were born abroad—considered a low figure for Los Angeles.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $105,253, a high figure for Los Angeles, and the percentage of households earning $125,000 and up was also considered high for the county. The average household size of 2.5 people was average for Los Angeles. Renters occupied 29.7% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 70.3%.

In 2000 there were 113 families headed by single parents, a low rate for the city and the county. The percentages of veterans who served during World War II or the Korean War were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood has been described as an &quot;Orthodox Jewish enclave&quot;.

<doc id="871034" wikidata="Q526270" url="?curid=871034" title="Fozzy">
<text>Fozzy is an American heavy metal band formed in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1999 by lead guitarist Rich Ward and drummer Frank Fontsere. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of vocalist Chris Jericho, Ward, second guitarist Billy Grey, bassist P. J. Farley and drummer Grant Brooks. Jericho has characterized the band by saying, &quot;If Metallica and Journey had a bastard child, it would be Fozzy.&quot; As of September 2022, the band has released eight studio albums and one live album. Their first two albums consist of primarily cover songs with some original material, while their albums since have made original material the primary focus.

==History==

===Formation (1999–2000)===
Fozzy started as Fozzy Osbourne, a play on the name of the singer Ozzy Osbourne, and was a cover band assembled by Ward from whatever musicians he could find in a given week. In 1999, Jericho and Ward met in San Antonio, Texas, after a wrestling show and Jericho was invited to play with the band. Their first show was held at the now-defunct club &quot;The Hangar&quot;, in the downtown square of Marietta, Georgia. Jericho sat in on a few sessions, but did not plan to play with them permanently. In 2000, Jericho rejoined the band and became its frontman under the persona of Moongoose McQueen, and the band went on tour. As part of the band&#x27;s &quot;gimmick&quot;, Jericho refused to acknowledge that Moongoose McQueen and Chris Jericho were the same person. When interviewed as Moongoose, he would stay in character the whole time and even feign ignorance of who Chris Jericho was. On the other side, Chris Jericho was a &quot;huge fan&quot; of Moongoose and Fozzy.

===&quot;Fozzy&quot; and &quot;Happenstance&quot; (2000–2002)===
The band shortened its name to Fozzy, and adopted the satirical back-story that they had signed with a record company to move to Japan to be huge rock stars, but the company went out of business, leaving them stranded for 20 years, while all their demos were snatched and recorded by other bands. Soon afterward, Fozzy produced their first album, &quot;Fozzy&quot;, featuring mostly covers of bands such as Dio, Krokus, Twisted Sister, Iron Maiden, Mötley Crüe and Judas Priest. Also, at one time the band considered changing their name to Big City Knights.

Fozzy&#x27;s second album, &quot;Happenstance&quot;, was produced in 2002, again with mostly covers of bands such as Black Sabbath, Scorpions, W.A.S.P. and Accept.

===&quot;All That Remains&quot; (2003–2006)===

After the Happenstance tour ended in 2003, the band dropped its back-story and Chris Jericho&#x27;s McQueen persona. In January 2005, they released their third album, &quot;All That Remains&quot;, which had entirely original tracks, including the singles &quot;Enemy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Lie&quot;, &quot;Born of Anger&quot;, and &quot;The Test&quot;. &quot;All That Remains&quot; included guest appearances by musicians Zakk Wylde (Black Label Society, Ozzy Osbourne, Pride &amp; Glory), Bone Crusher, Mark Tremonti (Creed, Alter Bridge), Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge, Slash), Marty Friedman (Megadeth) and Butch Walker (Marvelous 3). The album sold over 100,000 copies. In 2005, &quot;Enemy&quot; was the theme song for &quot;WWE No Way Out&quot; and in 2006 for a promotional video for &quot;TNA Bound for Glory&quot;. In 2005, the band played the Download Festival at Donington Park, England.

===&quot;Chasing the Grail&quot; (2009–2011)===
Soon after the release of &quot;All That Remains&quot;, a fourth album was announced.

On March 4, 2009, MetalUnderground.com reported that Fozzy had signed a worldwide record deal with Australian-based Riot! Entertainment to release their fourth album, &quot;Chasing the Grail&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Martyr No More&quot;, was announced as an official theme song for the WWE Royal Rumble pay per view. The album was released in America on January 26, 2010, followed by Australia (February) and Europe (March).

On February 19, 2011, Jericho said during an interview with Active Rock radio station WBSX in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, that he had completed lyrics for a brand new Fozzy album and that Ward was beginning work on writing the music. The band hoped to have the new album released in February 2012. According to Fozzy&#x27;s official Facebook page, the recordings were done on May 4, 2012. Fozzy released a brand new music video on June 7, which was shot at the Golden Gods Awards for the track &quot;God Pounds His Nails&quot;. On July 10, Fozzy played the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth, England. A special, two-CD edition of Fozzy&#x27;s live album &quot;Remains Alive&quot; was released with Chasing the Grail on July 18. The band then announced a headlining tour of the &quot;United Kingdom&quot; for November 2011.

On September 9, Sean Delson announced his &quot;retirement&quot; from Fozzy as their bass guitar player to resume work with Agent Cooper. Fozzy announced Paul Di Leo, the bass guitarist for Adrenaline Mob, as his replacement.

===&quot;Sin and Bones&quot; (2012–2013)===
On January 18, 2010, it was announced that Fozzy had signed with Century Media Records, and planned to release a new album later in the year. Jericho hinted the new album on his Twitter page, saying, &#x27;New @FOZZYROCK album in August?!&#x27;. Jericho recently made a full-time return to the WWE on January 4, but despite this, Fozzy was announced to be a part of the Download Festival in the UK, in the summer. On July 17, Fozzy released the first single from their fifth studio album, &quot;Sin and Bones&quot;, titled &quot;Sandpaper&quot;. The song features guest vocals by M. Shadows from Avenged Sevenfold and was also the Hell in a Cell theme song. Sin and Bones was released on August 14. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Chris Jericho once again left the WWE with his final appearance being on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, on August 20, so that he could go on tour with the band. Fozzy played on the 2012 Uproar Festival tour, headlining the Jägermeister stage. After the Uproar Festival, Fozzy scheduled an international tour with stops in Europe and Australia. Fozzy made their return to the U.S. in 2013 touring as an opener for Saxon on the &quot;Sacrifice and Sin&quot; tour. One tour date (September 21, Joilet, Illinois) was rescheduled and became a Fozzy solo date on October 16.

===&quot;Do You Wanna Start a War&quot; (2014–2015)===

During 2013, it was confirmed that Fozzy would begin working on a new record in 2014 and would be looking for a release date during the summer of 2014. The band entered the studio in late January. The first single, &quot;Lights Go Out&quot;, was released April 29. &quot;Lights Go Out&quot; reached number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart, becoming their first single to make it to the charts. Following the release of the new single, the band embarked on the &quot;Lights Go Out&quot; tour to promote their new album, playing festivals such as Carolina Rebellion, Rock on the Range, and Download, where they performed on the main stage for the first time in the band&#x27;s history. The second single, &quot;One Crazed Anarchist&quot;, was released on May 26, 2014, and was given away to people that pre-ordered the album. The album, &quot;Do You Wanna Start a War&quot;, was released on July 21 in the UK and Europe and July 22 in North America. The album also features guest appearances by Christie Cook and Steel Panther&#x27;s Michael Starr. In September 2014, the band announced that Jeff Rouse would be their new bassist, as Paul Di Leo mutually parted ways with the band in May.

===&quot;Judas&quot; (2016–2018)===
Jericho confirmed that Fozzy hoped to have their seventh studio album written by January 2016. As of December 2015, the band had started working on the record and hoped to have a release date sometime in summer 2016. However, Jericho said in an interview that it was unlikely to be released in 2016 and was more likely to be released in 2017; this could be due to his return as a full-time WWE in-ring competitor.

On March 18, 2017, Jericho announced that Paul Di Leo had rejoined Fozzy on his Instagram page, replacing Randy Drake as the bassist.

On April 26, 2017, the band released a short snippet of their new single and music video titled &quot;Judas&quot;, which premiered on &quot;Loudwire&quot; on May 2. &quot;Judas&quot; would later become one of the official theme songs for WWE&#x27;s NXT TakeOver: Chicago, as well as Jericho&#x27;s theme song in New Japan Pro-Wrestling and All Elite Wrestling. &quot;Judas&quot; instantly became a hit for the band, receiving over 30 million views on YouTube, and reaching number one on various charts worldwide, including reaching number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs, their highest charting position for a single. The band embarked on a show tour in May–June 2017.

Guitarist Rich Ward revealed in an interview with Blabbermouth that the album would be released in September 2017 and is also titled &quot;Judas&quot;. The album release date was revealed on Jericho&#x27;s official Instagram account: &quot;Judas&quot; was released on October 13, 2017. After extensive touring through 2017 - 2018, Paul Di Leo would again part ways and again be replaced with Randy Drake for the remainder of the 2018 Judas tour, including Fozzy playing at Jericho&#x27;s Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Wrestling Rager at Sea.
On October 22, 2017, Fozzy played at the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento, California.

===&quot;Boombox&quot; (2019–present)===
On April 4, 2019, Fozzy announced that they were signing with Sony Music. Following this, they announced they had entered the studio to begin recording of their eighth studio album, later tentatively named as &quot;2020&quot; due for release in 2020. Chris Jericho debuted the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; during a broadcast of &quot;The Rock of Jericho&quot; on August 23. &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; was later released on August 29, 2019. However, in July 2020, Chris Jericho said the album&#x27;s title had been scrapped, and the release was pushed to 2021. &quot;The original idea was to call it &#x27;2020&#x27;, until we realized that we&#x27;re not gonna have this thing done till November/December, so it&#x27;s not as contemporary anymore to put out an album called &#x27;2020&#x27; when it&#x27;s 2021. Let&#x27;s just leave it behind.&quot; The album, re-titled &quot;Boombox&quot;, was released on May 6, 2022.

<doc id="871037" wikidata="Q2604583" url="?curid=871037" title="Wakhi people">
<text>The Wakhi people (, , ; ; ), also locally referred to as the Wokhik (), are an Iranian ethnic group native to Central and South Asia. They are found in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and China—primarily situated in and around Afghanistan&#x27;s Wakhan Corridor, the northernmost part of Pakistan&#x27;s Gilgit−Baltistan and Chitral, Tajikistan&#x27;s Gorno−Badakhshan Autonomous Region and the southwestern areas of China&#x27;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Wakhi people are native speakers of the Wakhi language, an Eastern Iranian language.

== Name ==
The Wakhi people refer to themselves as &quot;Khik&quot; and to their language as &quot;Khik zik&quot;. The exonym &quot;Wakhī&quot;, which is given to them by their neighbours, is based on &quot;Wux̌&quot;, the local name of the region of Wakhan, deriving from *&quot;Waxšu&quot;, the old name of the Oxus River (Amu Darya), which is a major river formed by the junction of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.

== Demographics ==
Ethnic Wakhi-speakers have a total population of about 50,000–58,000. The population is divided between four countries: Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and China&#x27;s Xinjiang. The Wakhi people have been settlers of their lands for hundreds if not thousands of years. The machinations of The Great Game during the eighteenth and nineteenth century created boundaries which separated the large body of the Wakhis into living in four countries.

In Tajikistan, Wakhi are inhabitants of Roshtqal&#x27;a District and Ishkoshim District of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region.

In Afghanistan, Wakhi primarily live in the Wakhan District of Badakhshan Province.

In Gilgit-Baltistan in the north of Pakistan, Wakhi predominantly live in the upper region of Hunza popularly known as Gojal. Wakhi speakers also live in Ishkoman Valley of District Ghizer, and some villages of Yasin Valley.

In Pakistan, Wakhi also live in Broghal in Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

In China, Wakhi are inhabitants of Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County an administrative area within Kashgar Prefecture of Xinjiang, mainly in the township of Dafdar.

In China, the Wakhi people, together with the Sarikoli people, are officially recognized as &quot;Tajiks&quot;, with ethnic-minority autonomous status. In Afghanistan, they are officially called &quot;Pamiri&quot;. In Tajikistan, they are recognized by the state as &quot;Tajiks&quot;, but self-identify as &quot;Pamiri&quot;. In Pakistan, they refer to themselves as &quot;Wakhi&quot; or &quot;Pamiri&quot; or &quot;Gujali&quot;.

The Wakhi predominantly adhere to Nizari Ismaili Shia Islam, which is regarded as their ethnic religion and are followers of the Aga Khan.

== Economy ==
The Wakhi are primarily nomadic, depending on their herds of yaks and horses. They often have two residences—one for winter and one for summer. Their houses are built of stone and sod.

== Cultural preservation ==
Activists and researchers have been working to preserve and record the language of the Wakhi people, and have developed Wakhi orthographies using the Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin scripts.

In 1990, the Gojali Wakhis of Pakistan established the Wakhi Tajik Cultural Association to preserve, document, and publish their local culture. The association introduced a script that was applied into linguistic and literary textbooks, and organized cultural festivals. Radio Pakistan&#x27;s Radio Gilgit also aired a daily Wakhi-language program named &quot;Bam-e Dunya&quot; (&quot;Roof of the World&quot;).

<text>Raul Alejandro Viñao (born 4 September 1951) is an Argentine composer based in London.

==Early life==
Viñao studied musical composition in Buenos Aires with the composer Jacobo Ficher. In 1976 he was awarded a British Council scholarship to study in London at the Royal College of Music and later on at the City University where he was awarded a PhD in composition. 

==Career==
In the 1980s, Viñao worked at IRCAM in Paris where he developed a particular interest in sound interpolation (sound morphing) a technique that has featured in many of his compositions such as Chant D&#x27;Ailleurs which won the Prix Ars Electronica in 1992.
Viñao has written orchestral and chamber music for the concert hall, opera and music-theatre, film scores, music for multimedia events and rock and popular music. He has also created and presented programmes for BBC Radio 3.

He has written a number of percussion works, such as Khan Variations for solo Marimba, which have become very well known in the US, Europe and Japan.

At the rhythmic level Viñao&#x27;s work has been influenced by non-western musical traditions as well as by the music of Conlon Nancarrow. In percussion pieces such as Estudios de Fronteras (2004), Viñao used complex polyrhythms to realise with percussion instruments played by human performers ideas derived from Nancarrow&#x27;s etudes for pianola. He also explored complex ideas on multi temporality using acoustic instruments combined with electroacoustic means, most noticeably in his string quartet Phrase &amp; Fiction (1994/1995). 

Viñao presented his views on Nancarrow and his influence on a generation of composer such as himself in a BBC radio programme entitled &#x27;Children of Nancarrow&#x27;.

Later work by Viñao&#x27;s focused on social and political issues, writing music-theatre or concert pieces concerned with themes such as the invasion of Iraq (&quot;The Baghdad Monologue&quot;, 2005), the fate of deprived children around the world (&quot;Chicos del 21&quot;, 2010) and the financial crisis of 2008 (&quot;Greed&quot;, 2012).

==Personal life==
Viñao has been a British citizen since 1994, holding dual nationality. He lives in Crouch End, North London with his wife, American-born actress Lachele Carl. They have a son, Matteo.

<text>Elmer Chester Snowden (October 9, 1900 – May 14, 1973) was an American banjo player of the jazz age. He also played guitar and, in the early stages of his career, all the reed instruments. He contributed greatly to jazz in its early days as both a player and a bandleader, and launched the careers of many top musicians.

==Biography==
Elmer Snowden was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, to Gertude Snowden, and had a brother, James. His mother worked as a laundress, but by the time of the 1917 World War I draft registration, a month before his 17th birthday, he was already listing his occupation as &quot;musician,&quot; while living with his mother, and the 1920 Federal Census lists him still living at home, employed as a &quot;musician in a dance hall.&quot;

Snowden was the original leader of the Washingtonians, a group he brought to New York City from the capital in 1923. Unable to gain a booking, Snowden sent for Duke Ellington, who was with the group when it recorded three test sides for Victor that were never issued. Ellington eventually took over leadership of the band, which contained the nucleus of what later became his orchestra.

Snowden was also a renowned band leader – Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Bubber Miley, &quot;Tricky Sam&quot; Nanton, Frankie Newton, Benny Carter, Rex Stewart, Roy Eldridge and Chick Webb are among the musicians who worked in his bands.

Very active in the 1920s as an agent and musician, Snowden at one time had five bands playing under his name in New York, one of which was led by pianist Cliff Jackson. Most of his bands were not recorded, but a Snowden band that included Eldridge, Al Sears, Dicky Wells and Sid Catlett appeared in a Vitaphone Varieties short film, &quot;Smash Your Baggage&quot; (1932).

Although Snowden continued to be musically active throughout his life, after the mid 1930s, with the retirement of his long-time musical partner Bob Fuller, his career was one of relative obscurity in New York. He continued to play through to the 1950s, but outside the limelight. After a dispute with the musicians&#x27; union in New York, he moved to Philadelphia, where he taught music, counting among his pupils pianist Ray Bryant, his brother, bassist Tommy Bryant, and saxophonist Sahib Shihab, originally known as Edmond Gregory.

Snowden was working as a parking lot attendant in 1959 when Chris Albertson, then a Philadelphia disc jockey, came across him. In 1960, Albertson brought Snowden and singer-guitarist Lonnie Johnson together for two Prestige albums, assembled a quartet that included Cliff Jackson for a Riverside session, &quot;Harlem Banjo,&quot; and, in 1961, a sextet session with Roy Eldridge, Bud Freeman, Jo Jones, and Ray and Tommy Bryant—it was released on the Fontana and Black Lion labels.

In 1963, his career boosted, Snowden appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival. He then moved to California to teach at the University of California, Berkeley, and played with Turk Murphy as well as taking private students for lessons in guitar and banjo. He toured Europe in 1967 with the Newport Guitar Workshop.

In 1969, Snowden moved back to Philadelphia, where he died on May 14, 1973.

<doc id="871044" wikidata="Q615183" url="?curid=871044" title="Sensō-ji">
<text>, is an ancient Buddhist temple in Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan. It is Tokyo&#x27;s oldest-established temple, and one of its most significant. It is dedicated to Kannon, the bodhisattva of compassion. Structures in the temple complex include the main hall, a five-story pagoda and large gates. It is the most widely visited religious site in the world with over 30 million visitors annually.

The temple was destroyed during a 10 March 1945 firebombing air raid on Tokyo during World War II. The main hall was rebuilt in the 1950s. Formerly associated with the Tendai sect of Buddhism, the temple became independent after the war. Leading to it is Nakamise-dōri street, containing many shops with traditional goods. Adjacent to the east of Sensō-ji is the Asakusa Shrine of the Shinto religion.

== History ==

The temple is dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon (Avalokiteśvara). According to legend, a statue of the Kannon was found in the Sumida River in 628 AD by two fishermen, brothers Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari. The chief of their village, Hajino Nakamoto, recognized the sanctity of the statue and enshrined it by remodeling his own house into a small temple in Asakusa so that the villagers could worship Kannon.

The first temple was founded in 645 AD, which makes it the oldest-established temple in Tokyo. In the early years of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu designated Sensō-ji as tutelary temple of the Tokugawa clan.

During World War II, the temple was destroyed during the 10 March 1945 firebombing air raid on Tokyo. The main hall was rebuilt in 1951–58 and has been perceived as a symbol of rebirth and peace by Japanese people. In the courtyard there is a tree that was hit by a bomb in the air raids, and it had regrown in the husk of the old tree and is a similar symbol as the temple itself. The temple now has a titanium tiled roof that maintains a historic image but is stronger and lighter. The Kaminarimon gate was rebuilt in 1960, the Hōzōmon gate in 1964, and the pagoda in 1973.

The Nishinomiya Inari shrine was located within the precincts of Sensō-ji and a torii identified the entry into the hallowed ground of the shrine. A bronze plaque on the gateway structure listed those who contributed to the construction of the torii, which was erected in 1727 (&quot;Kyōhō 12, 11th month&quot;). After the Meiji government ordered the separation of Shinto and Buddhism in 1868, the Inari shrine was moved to the grounds of the Asakusa Shrine, where it was destroyed in the 10 March 1945 firebombing.
==Temple grounds==

Sensō-ji is the focus of Tokyo&#x27;s largest and most popular festival, Sanja Matsuri. This takes place over 3 to 4 days in late spring, and sees the surrounding streets closed to traffic from dawn until late evening.

Dominating the entrance to the temple is the Kaminarimon or &quot;Thunder Gate&quot;. This imposing Buddhist structure features a massive paper lantern dramatically painted in vivid red-and-black tones to suggest thunderclouds and lightning. Beyond the Kaminarimon is Nakamise-dori with its shops, followed by the Hōzōmon or &quot;Treasure House Gate&quot;, which provides the entrance to the inner complex. Within the precincts stand a stately five-story pagoda and the main hall, devoted to Kannon.

Many tourists, both Japanese and from abroad, visit Sensō-ji every year. Catering to the visiting crowds, the surrounding area has many traditional shops and eating places that feature traditional dishes (hand-made noodles, sushi, tempura, etc.). Nakamise-Dori, the street leading from the Thunder Gate to the temple itself, is lined with small shops selling souvenirs ranging from fans, &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; (woodblock prints), kimono and other robes, Buddhist scrolls, traditional sweets, to Godzilla toys, t-shirts and mobile phone straps. These shops themselves are part of a living tradition of selling to pilgrims who walked to Sensō-ji.

Within the temple itself, and also at many places on its approach, there are &quot;o-mikuji&quot; stalls. For a suggested donation of 100 yen, visitors may consult the oracle and divine answers to their questions. Querents shake labelled sticks from enclosed metal containers and read the corresponding answers they retrieve from one of 100 possible drawers.

Within the temple is a quiet contemplative garden kept in the distinctive Japanese style.

=== Kaminarimon ===

The is the outer of two large entrance gates that ultimately lead to the Sensō-ji (the inner being the Hōzōmon) in Asakusa. The gate, with its lantern and statues, is popular with tourists. It stands tall, wide and covers an area of . The first gate was built in 941, but the current gate dates back to 1960, after the previous gate was destroyed in a fire in 1865.

==== History ====
The Kaminarimon was first built in 941 AD by Taira no Kinmasa, a military commander. It was originally located near Komagata, but it was reconstructed in its current location in 1635. This is believed to be when the gods of wind and thunder were first placed on the gate. The gate has been destroyed many times throughout the ages. Four years after its relocation, the Kaminarimon burned down, and in 1649 AD Tokugawa Iemitsu rebuilt the gate along with several other of the major structures in the temple complex. The gate burnt to the ground in 1757 AD and again in 1865 AD. The Kaminarimon&#x27;s current structure was dedicated in December 1960 AD . Ninety-five years after the last fire, Konosuke Matsushita, the founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial Company (now Panasonic), was asked to rebuild the gate. With monetary donations from Matsushita, it was rebuilt in 1960.

==== Features ====

Four statues are housed in the Kaminarimon, two in the front alcoves and two on the other side. On the front of the gate, the statues of the Shinto gods Fūjin and Raijin are displayed. Fūjin, the god of wind, is located on the east side of the gate, while Raijin, the god of thunder, is located on the west side. The original sculptures were severely damaged in the fire of 1865, with only the heads being saved, and the statues restored for the gate&#x27;s 1960 reconstruction.

Two additional statues stand on the reverse of the gate: the Buddhist god Tenryū on the east, and the goddess Kinryū on the west side. These were donated in 1978 to commemorate the 1350th anniversary of the first appearance of the bodhisattva Kannon (Avalokiteśvara) at Asakusa, which led to the founding of Sensō-ji. The statues were carved by then-106-year-old master sculptor Hirakushi Denchū.

A giant red lantern (&quot;chōchin&quot;) hangs under the center of the gate. It is tall, wide and weighs approximately . The current lantern, the fifth iteration, was built by Takahashi Chōchin K.K in 2013 and has the same metallic base on the bottom as the previous lantern. The base has a name plate that says &quot;Matsushita Denki&quot;, an abbreviated form of Panasonic&#x27;s old Japanese name, Matsushita Denki Sangyo Kabushiki Gaisha. The front of the lantern displays the gate&#x27;s name, . Painted on the back is the gate&#x27;s official name, . During festivals such as Sanja Matsuri, the lantern is collapsed to let tall objects pass through the gate.

The characters on the tablet above the lantern read from right to left and reference the Sensō-ji.

=== Hōzōmon ===

The is the inner of two large entrance gates that lead to the Sensō-ji. It is a two-story gate (&quot;nijūmon&quot;), and its second story houses many of the Sensō-ji&#x27;s treasures. The first story houses two statues, three lanterns and two large sandals. It stands tall, wide, and deep.

==== History ====

The Hōzōmon was first built in 942 AD by Taira no Kinmasa. Destroyed by fire in 1631, it was rebuilt by Tokugawa Iemitsu in 1636. It stood for 300 more years until it was once again burned down during the Tokyo air raids of 1945. In 1964, the present steel-reinforced concrete structure was built with a donation of ¥150 million from Yonetarō Motoya.

Since the gate was reconstructed using flame-resistant materials, the upper story of the Hōzōmon stores the Sensō-ji&#x27;s treasured sutras. These treasures include a copy of the Lotus Sutra that is designated a Japanese National Treasure and the &quot;Issai-kyō&quot;, a complete collection of Buddhist scriptures that has been designated an Important Cultural Property.

==== Features ====

Unlike the Kaminarimon, which houses four different statues, the Hōzōmon houses two guardian statues that are located on either side of the gate&#x27;s south face. These tall statues represent Niō, the guardian deities of the Buddha. Because of these statues, the gate was originally called the before it was renamed the Hōzōmon.

The gate also features three large lanterns. The largest and most prominent lantern is a red &quot;chōchin&quot; that hangs under the center of the gate&#x27;s opening. With a height of , a diameter of and a weight of , the lantern displays the name of the town . The current iteration of the lantern dates back to 2003 when ¥2 billion was donated by the people of Kobunachō. Its donation commemorated the 10th-year-anniversary of the start of the Edo period. On either side of the &quot;chōchin&quot; hangs five tall copper &quot;tōrō&quot; weighing approximately each. All three lanterns are completely removed during festivals such as Sanja Matsuri.

On the Hōzōmon&#x27;s east (back) face are the &quot;waraji&quot;, two long, wide straw sandals that weigh each.

==Nakamise-dōri==
The is a street on the approach to the temple. It is said to have come about in the early 12th century, when neighbors of Sensō-ji were granted permission to set up shops on the approach to the temple. However, in May 1885 the government of Tokyo ordered all shop owners to leave. In December of that same year the area was reconstructed in Western-style brick. During the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake many of the shops were destroyed, then rebuilt in 1925 using concrete, only to be destroyed again during the bombings of World War II. The street is approximately long and contains around 72 shops.

<text>Wharf Rats are a group of concert-goers who have chosen to live drug and alcohol-free. They arose out of the environment around the rock group the Grateful Dead and their followers the Deadheads, both of which were rooted in the drug-embracing counterculture of the 1960s.

Their primary purpose is to support other concert goers who choose to live drug-free, like themselves. They announce their presence with yellow balloons, signs, and the Wharf Rats information table. At a set break during Grateful Dead (and related) concerts they hold self-help style meetings but are not affiliated specifically with any twelve-step organization and have no requirement for attendance at one of their meetings besides providing some helpful drug free fellowship. Like Deadheads, members of Wharf Rats come from all walks of life. By 1990, the Wharf Rats mailing list had some 3,000 names.

The Wharf Rats began during the early 1980s as a group of Deadheads under the name &quot;The Wharf Rat Group of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. The Wharf Rats originally came from a small group of Narcotics Anonymous members who went to a Grateful Dead concert in Philadelphia and located each other by their yellow balloons with the NA symbol drawn on in Magic Marker. However due to operational differences they soon split off from Narcotics Anonymous, and are not affiliated with them, AA, or any other twelve-step program (though many of members of the Wharf Rats are members of AA, NA or other 12-step programs). The Wharf Rats see themselves as &quot;a group of friends sharing a common bond, providing support, information and some traction in an otherwise slippery environment.&quot; The relationship between the Wharf Rats and more traditional such groups has been studied in the academic journal &quot;Deviant Behavior&quot;.

While the Wharf Rats originated at Grateful Dead concerts, they now have a presence at other concerts as well. Similar groups include The Phellowship for Phish, The Gateway for Widespread Panic, The Jellyfish for The String Cheese Incident, Much Obliged for Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, Happy Hour Heroes for moe., the Digital Buddhas for The Disco Biscuits, Better Than Before for The Werks, the Hummingbirds for Bassnectar, and the Sunny Bunny Recovery for Ween, Dustie Baggies for Billy Strings and The Hot Tea Party for Goose—all based on the Wharf Rats, which remain the best-known.

The name of this group comes from the 1971 Dead song &quot;Wharf Rat&quot; (written by Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter and appearing on &quot;Skull &amp; Roses&quot;), which contains the self-told story of August West, a down-and-out dockside . By at least one interpretation, the song was aimed partly at Deadheads.

<text>Tom and Jerry is an American animated media franchise and series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the enmity between the titular characters of a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.

In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958. During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot; with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts for Rembrandt Films in Czechoslovakia from 1961 to 1962. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. Chuck Jones produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Five more shorts have been produced since 2001, making a total of 166 shorts.

A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (1975), &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot; (1980–1982), &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; (1990–1993), &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; (2006–2008), and &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (2014–2021). In 1992, the first feature-length film based on the series, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;, was released. 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002. In 2019, a musical adaptation of the series, titled &quot;Tom and Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream&quot;, debuted in Japan, in advance of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;″s 80th anniversary. In 2021, a live-action/animated hybrid film was released.

==Plot==
The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a house mouse (Jerry). The plots of many shorts are often set in the backdrop of a house, centering on Tom (who is often enlisted by a human) trying to capture Jerry, and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry&#x27;s cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, on several occasions, they have displayed genuine friendship and concern for each other&#x27;s well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escapes the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger, in the shorts &quot;Busy Buddies&quot; and &quot;Tot Watchers&quot; respectively. Despite their endless attacks on one another, they have saved each other&#x27;s lives every time they were truly in danger, except in &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot;, which features an uncharacteristically morbid ending, and &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot;, where both sit on a railroad track at the end after being jilted by girlfriends. The cartoon irises out with the whistle of an oncoming steam train.

The cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation: Tom may use axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. Jerry&#x27;s methods of retaliation are far more violent, with frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom&#x27;s tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on. While &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; has often been criticized as excessively violent, there is no blood or gore in any scene.

Music plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores that combined elements of jazz, classical, and pop music. Bradley often used contemporary pop songs and songs from other films, including MGM films like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

Even though Tom and Jerry almost never speak, the shorts also often had dialogue from other characters. Minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters speak English on rare occasions. For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.

==Characters==

===Tom and Jerry===
Tom, named &quot;Jasper&quot; in his debut appearance, is a gray and white domestic shorthair cat. &quot;Tom&quot; is a generic name for a male cat. He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while Jerry, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in his debut appearance, is a small, brown house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry&#x27;s wits. Jerry possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom&#x27;s, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. 

Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. He tries to hurt or compete with him just to taunt Jerry, even as revenge, or to obtain a reward from a human, including his owner(s)/master(s), for catching Jerry, or for generally doing his job well as a house cat. By the final &quot;fade-out&quot; of each cartoon, Jerry usually gets the best of Tom.

Other results may be reached. On rare occasions, Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or he pushes Tom a little too far. In &quot;The Million Dollar Cat&quot;, Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal, especially mice. He then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates. In &quot;Timid Tabby&quot; Tom&#x27;s look-alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge. Occasionally and usually ironically, they both lose, usually because Jerry&#x27;s last trap or attack on Tom backfires on him or he overlooks something. In Chuck Jones&#x27; &quot;Filet Meow&quot;, Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterward, the shark scares Jerry away as well. They occasionally end up being friends, although there is often a last-minute event that ruins the truce. One cartoon that has a friendly ending is &quot;Snowbody Loves Me&quot;.

Both characters display sadistic tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event. However, when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party, the other will develop a conscience and save him. Occasionally, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks. Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty, and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both. 

Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens, or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary. This is the case in &quot;Posse Cat&quot;, when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner, but Tom then reneges. Other times, Tom keeps his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved.

Tom changes his love interest many times. The first love interest is Toots who appears in &quot;Puss n&#x27; Toots&quot;, and calls him &quot;Tommy&quot; in &quot;The Mouse Comes to Dinner&quot;. He is interested in a cat called Toots in &quot;The Zoot Cat&quot; although she has a different appearance to the original Toots. The most frequent love interest of Tom&#x27;s is Toodles Galore, who never has any dialogue in the cartoons.

Despite five shorts ending with a depiction of Tom&#x27;s apparent death, his demise is never permanent. He even reads about his own death in a flashback in &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Diary&quot;. He appears to die in explosions in &quot;Mouse Trouble&quot;, after which he is seen in heaven, &quot;Yankee Doodle Mouse&quot; and in &quot;Safety Second&quot;, while in &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot; he is guillotined offscreen. The short &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot; ends with both Tom and Jerry sitting on the railroad tracks with the intent of suicide while the whistle of an oncoming train is heard foreshadowing their imminent death.

====Tom and Jerry speaking====
Although many supporting and minor characters speak, Tom and Jerry rarely do so themselves. One exception is &quot;The Lonesome Mouse&quot; where they speak several times briefly, primarily Jerry, to contrive to get Tom back into the house. Tom more often sings while wooing female cats. For example, Tom sings Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot; in the 1946 short &quot;Solid Serenade&quot;. In that short and &quot;Zoot Cat&quot;, Tom woos female cats using a deep, heavily French-accented voice in imitation of then-popular leading man, actor Charles Boyer. 

At the end of &quot;The Million Dollar Cat&quot;, after beginning to antagonize Jerry he says, &quot;Gee, I&#x27;m throwin&#x27; away a million dollars... BUT I&#x27;M HAPPY!&quot;. In &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring&quot;, Jerry says, &quot;No, no, no, no, no.&quot; when choosing the shop to remove his ring. In &quot;The Mouse Comes to Dinner&quot;, Tom speaks to his girlfriend Toots while inadvertently sitting on a stove: &quot;Say, what&#x27;s cookin&#x27;?&quot;, to which Toots replies &quot;You are, stupid.&quot; 

Another instance of speech comes in &quot;Solid Serenade&quot; and &quot;The Framed Cat&quot;, where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner. In &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, Jerry prays for his life when Tom catches him by the tail. Jerry has whispered in Tom&#x27;s ear on several occasions. In &quot;Love Me, Love My Mouse&quot;, Jerry calls Toots &quot;Mama&quot;.

Co-director William Hanna provided most of the squeaks, gasps, and other vocal effects for the pair, including the most famous sound effects from the series, Tom&#x27;s leather-lunged scream, created by recording Hanna&#x27;s scream and eliminating the beginning and ending of the recording, leaving only the strongest part of the scream on the soundtrack, and Jerry&#x27;s nervous gulp.

The only other reasonably common vocalization is made by Tom when some external reference claims a certain scenario or eventuality to be impossible, which inevitably thwarts Tom&#x27;s plans – at which point, a bedraggled and battered Tom appears and says in a haunting, echoing voice &quot;Don&#x27;t you believe it!&quot;, a reference to the then-popular 1940s radio show &quot;Don&#x27;t You Believe It!&quot;. In &quot;Mouse Trouble&quot;, Tom says &quot;Don&#x27;t you believe it!&quot; after being beaten up by Jerry, which also happens in &quot;The Missing Mouse&quot;. In the 1946 short &quot;Trap Happy&quot;, Tom hires a cat disguised as a mouse exterminator who, after several failed attempts to dispatch Jerry and suffering a lot of accidents in the process, changes profession to &quot;Cat&quot; exterminator by crossing out the &quot;Mouse&quot; on his title and writing &quot;CAT&quot;, resulting in Tom spelling out the word out loud before reluctantly pointing at himself. 

One short, 1956&#x27;s &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot;, is narrated by Jerry in VoiceOver, voiced by Paul Frees, as they try to win back their ladyfriends. Jerry was voiced by Sara Berner during his appearance in the 1945 MGM musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; is the first, and so far only installment of the series where the famous cat-and-mouse duo regularly speaks or is able to be understood by humans. In that film, Tom was voiced by Richard Kind, and Jerry was voiced by Dana Hill.

===Spike and Tyke===
In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike, known as &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Butch&quot; in some shorts, an angry, vicious but gullible bulldog who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute, aside from howls and biting noises as well as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions, performed by Billy Bletcher and later Daws Butler, modeled after comedian Jimmy Durante. Spike&#x27;s coat has altered throughout the years between gray and creamy tan. The addition of Spike&#x27;s son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike&#x27;s character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series called &quot;Spike and Tyke&quot;.

Most cartoons with Spike in them conform to a theme: usually, Spike is trying to accomplish something, such as building a dog house or sleeping, when Tom and Jerry&#x27;s antics stop him doing it. Spike then presumably due to prejudice, singles out Tom as the culprit, and threatens him that if it ever happens again, he will do &quot;something horrible&quot; to him, effectively forcing Tom to take the blame, while Jerry overhears. Afterward, Jerry usually does anything he can to interrupt whatever Spike is doing, while Tom barely manages to stop him, usually getting injured in the process. Usually, Jerry eventually wrecks whatever Spike is doing in spectacular fashion, and leaves Tom to take the blame, forcing him to flee from Spike and inevitably lose.

Off-screen, Spike does something to Tom, and Tom is generally shown injured or in a bad situation while Jerry smugly cuddles up to Spike unscathed. Tom sometimes gets irritated with Spike. An example is in &quot;That&#x27;s My Pup!&quot;, when Spike forces Tom to run up a tree every time his son barked, causing Tom to hang Tyke on a flag pole. At least once, Tom does something that benefits Spike, who promises not to interfere ever again, causing Jerry to frantically leave the house and run into the distance, in &quot;Hic-cup Pup&quot;. Spike is well known for his famous &quot;&quot;Listen pussycat!&quot; catchphrase when he threatens Tom, his other famous catchphrase is &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s my boy!&quot; normally said when he supports or congratulates his son.

Tyke is described as a cute, sweet-looking, happy and lovable puppy. He is Spike&#x27;s son. Unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates, mostly towards his father, by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling. Spike would always go out of his way to care and comfort his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son and they get along like friends, although most of time they would be taking a nap or Spike would teach Tyke the main facts of life of being a dog. Like Spike, Tyke&#x27;s appearance has altered throughout the years, from gray, with white paws, to creamy tan. When &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; first aired, this was the first time that viewers heard Tyke speak.

===Butch and Toodles Galore===
Butch is a black, cigar-smoking alley cat who also wants to eat Jerry. He is Tom&#x27;s most frequent adversary. For most of the shorts he appears in, he is usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles. Butch was Tom&#x27;s chum as in some cartoons, where Butch is leader of Tom&#x27;s alley cat buddies, who are mostly Lightning, Topsy, and Meathead. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most shorts.

Butch and Toodles were originally introduced in Hugh Harman&#x27;s 1941 short &quot;The Alley Cat&quot;, but were integrated into &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; rather than continuing in their own series.

===Nibbles===
Nibbles is a small gray mouse who often appears in shorts as an orphan mouse. He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry&#x27;s command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. This can lead to such results as &quot;getting the cheese&quot; by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry&#x27;s example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. Many times Nibbles is an ally of Jerry in fights against Tom, including being the second Mouseketeer. He is given speaking roles in all his appearances as a Mouseketeer, often with a high-pitched French tone. However, during a short in which he rescued Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.

===The Housekeeper ===
The housekeeper, usually seen from the torso down, is a heavy-set, middle-aged black woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters. Voiced by character actress Lillian Randolph, she is often seen as the owner of Tom, and perhaps the homeowner as well. Her face was only shown once, very briefly, in &quot;Saturday Evening Puss&quot;. Her appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype that had been protested as racist by the NAACP and other civil rights groups since the 1940s. In a 1975 article in Film Comment she was referred to as &quot;Mammy Two Shoes,&quot; a moniker that has been inaccurately attributed to the character ever since, The name &quot;Mammy Two-Shoes&quot; was on the Disney model sheets for a character in a Silly Symphony cartoon, though the name was never spoken in the cartoon. A similar housekeeper then appeared in MGM Bokso cartoons by Harman and Ising, also without a name. At no time, ever, was the name used in any Tom and Jerry cartoon, The author of the 1975 later apologized, but too much time had established the incorrect information, including on the DVD release DVD releases of the cartoons, in which the script read by Whoopi Goldberg on the &quot;Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Vol. 2&quot; DVD set, while explaining the importance of African-American representation in the cartoon series, however stereotyped, mentions the incorrect name numerous times.

==History==
&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was a commonplace phrase for young men given to drinking, gambling, and riotous living in 19th-century London, England. The term comes from &quot;Life in London; or, The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom&quot; (1821) by Pierce Egan, the British sports journalist who authored similar accounts compiled as &quot;Boxiana&quot;. However Brewer notes no more than an &quot;unconscious&quot; echo of the Regency era, and thus Georgian era, origins in the naming of the cartoon.

===Hanna-Barbera era (1940–1958)===
In August 1937, animator and storyman Joseph Barbera began to work at MGM, then the largest studio in Hollywood. He learned that co-owner Louis B. Mayer wished to boost the animation department by encouraging the artists to develop some new cartoon characters, following the lack of success with its earlier cartoon series based on the &quot;Captain and the Kids&quot; comic strip. Barbera then teamed with fellow Ising unit animator and director William Hanna, who joined Harman-Ising Productions in 1930, and pitched new ideas, among them was the concept of two &quot;equal characters who were always in conflict with each other&quot;. An early thought involved a fox and a dog before they settled on a cat and mouse. The pair discussed their ideas with producer Fred Quimby, then the head of the short film department who, despite a lack of interest in it, gave them the green-light to produce one cartoon short.

The first short, &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, features a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, named Jinx in pre-production, and an African American housemaid named Mammy Two Shoes. Leonard Maltin described it as &quot;very new and special [...] that was to change the course of MGM cartoon production&quot; and established the successful &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; formula of comical cat and mouse chases with slapstick gags. It was released onto the theatre circuit on February 10, 1940. The pair, having been advised by management not to produce any more, focused on other cartoons including &quot;Gallopin&#x27; Gals&quot; (1940) and &quot;Officer Pooch&quot; (1941). Matters changed when Texas businesswoman Bessa Short sent a letter to MGM, asking whether more cat and mouse shorts would be produced, which helped convince management to commission a series. 

A studio contest held to rename both characters was won by animator John Carr, who suggested Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse. Carr was awarded a first-place prize of $50, . It has been suggested, but not proven, that the names were derived from a 1932 story by Damon Runyon, who took them from the name of a popular Christmastime cocktail, itself derived from the names of two characters in an 1821 stage play by William Moncrieff, an adaptation of 1821 Egan&#x27;s book titled &quot;Life in London&quot; where the names originated, which was based on George Cruikshank&#x27;s, Isaac Robert Cruikshank&#x27;s, and Egan&#x27;s own careers. &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot; was a critical success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject: Cartoons in 1941 despite the credits listing Ising and omitting Hanna and Barbera.

After MGM gave the green-light for Hanna and Barbera to continue, the studio entered production on the second &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon, &quot;The Midnight Snack&quot; (1941). The pair continued to work on the series for the next fifteen years of their career. The composer of the series, Scott Bradley, made it difficult for the musicians to perform his score which often involved the twelve-tone technique developed by Arnold Schoenberg. The series developed a quicker, more energetic and violent tone which was inspired by the work of MGM colleague Tex Avery. Hanna and Barbera made minor adjustments to Tom and Jerry&#x27;s appearance so they would &quot;age gracefully&quot;. Jerry lost weight and his long eyelashes, while Tom lost his jagged fur for a smoother appearance, had larger eyebrows, and received a white and gray face with a white mouth. He adopted a quadrupedal stance at first, like a real cat, to become increasingly and almost exclusively bipedal.

Hanna and Barbera produced 114 cartoons for MGM, thirteen of which were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Subject. Seven went on to win, breaking the winning streak held by Walt Disney&#x27;s studio in the category. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series. Barbera estimated the typical budget of $50,000 for each &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon which made the duo take &quot;time to get it right&quot;. A typical cartoon took around six weeks to make.

As per standard practice for American animation production at the time, Barbera and Hanna did not work with a script beforehand. After coming up with a cartoon idea together, Barbera would flesh out the story by drawing a storyboard and provide character designs and animation layouts. Hanna did the animation timing - planning the music and temporal beats and accents the animation action would occur on - and assigned the animators their scenes and supervised their work. Hanna provided incidental voice work, in particular Tom&#x27;s numerous screams of pain. Despite minimal creative input, as head of the MGM cartoon studio, Quimby was credited as the producer of all cartoons until 1955.

The rise in television in the 1950s caused problems for the MGM animation studio, leading to budget cuts on &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons due to decreased revenue from theatrical screenings. In an attempt to combat this, MGM ordered that all subsequent shorts be produced in the widescreen CinemaScope format. The first, &quot;Pet Peeve&quot;, was released in November 1954. The studio found that re-releases of older cartoons were earning as much as new ones, resulting in the executive decision to cease production on &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and later the animation studio on May 15, 1957. The final cartoon produced by Hanna and Barbera, &quot;Tot Watchers&quot;, was released on August 1, 1958. The pair decided to leave and went on to focus on their own production company Hanna-Barbera Productions, which went on to produce such popular animated television series including &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;.

====Production formats====
Before 1954, all &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio and format. In 1954 and 1955, some of the output was dually produced in dual versions: one Academy-ratio negative composed for a flat widescreen (1.75:1) format and one shot in the CinemaScope process. From 1955 until the close of the MGM cartoon studio a year later, all &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were produced in CinemaScope. Some even had their soundtracks recorded in Perspecta directional audio. All of the Hanna and Barbera cartoons were shot as successive color exposure negatives in Technicolor.

===Gene Deitch era (1961–1962)===
In 1961, MGM revived the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; franchise, and contracted European animation studio Rembrandt Films to produce 13 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts in Prague, Czechoslovakia. All were directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder. Deitch wrote most of the cartoons, with occasional assistance from Larz Bourne and Eli Bauer. Štěpán Koníček provided the musical score for the Deitch shorts. Sound effects were produced by electronic music composer Tod Dockstader and Deitch. The majority of vocal effects and voices in Deitch&#x27;s films were provided by Allen Swift and Deitch.

Deitch states that, being a &quot;UPA man&quot;, he was not a fan of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, thinking they were &quot;needlessly violent&quot;. However, after being assigned to work on the series, he quickly realized that &quot;nobody took [the violence] seriously&quot;, and it was merely &quot;a parody of exaggerated human emotions&quot;. He also came to see what he perceived as the &quot;biblical roots&quot; in Tom and Jerry&#x27;s conflict, similar to David and Goliath, stating &quot;That&#x27;s where we feel a connection to these cartoons: the little guy can win (or at least survive) to fight another day.&quot;

Since the Deitch/Snyder team had seen only a handful of the original &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, and since the team produced their cartoons on a tighter budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered surrealist in nature, though this was not Deitch&#x27;s intention. The animation was limited and jerky in movement compared to the more fluid Hanna-Barbera shorts, and often utilized motion blur. Background art was done in a more simplistic, angular, Art Deco-esque style. The soundtracks featured sparse and echoic electronic music, futuristic sound effects, heavy reverb and dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken. According to Jen Nessel of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons.&quot;

Whereas Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s shorts generally took place in and outside of a house, Deitch&#x27;s shorts opted for more exotic locations, such as a 19th-century whaling ship, the jungles of Nairobi, an Ancient Greek acropolis, or the Wild West. In addition, Mammy Two Shoes was replaced as Tom&#x27;s owner by a bald, overweight, short-tempered, middle-aged white man, who bore a striking resemblance to another Deitch character, Clint Clobber. Just like Spike the Bulldog, he was also significantly more brutal and violent in punishing Tom&#x27;s actions as compared to previous owners, often beating and thrashing Tom repeatedly; the character and his extreme treatment of Tom was poorly received.

To avoid being linked to Communism, Deitch modified the Czech names of his crew in the opening credits of the shorts to look more conventional to English-speaking audiences, e.g. Štěpán Koníček became &quot;Steven Konichek&quot; and Václav Lídl became &quot;Victor Little&quot;. These shorts are among the few &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons not to carry the &quot;Made In Hollywood, U.S.A.&quot; phrase on the end title card. Due to Deitch&#x27;s studio being behind the Iron Curtain, the production studio&#x27;s location is omitted entirely on it. After the 13 shorts were completed, Joe Vogel, the head of production, was fired from MGM. Vogel had approved of Deitch and his team&#x27;s work, but MGM decided not to renew their contract after Vogel&#x27;s departure. The final of the 13 shorts, &quot;Carmen Get It!&quot;, was released on December 21, 1962.

Deitch&#x27;s shorts were commercial successes. In 1962, the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, dethroning &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, which had held the position for 16 years. However, unlike the Hanna-Barbera shorts, none of Deitch&#x27;s films were nominated for any Academy Awards. In retrospect, these shorts are often considered the worst of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; theatrical output. Deitch stated that due to his team&#x27;s inexperience as well as their low budget, he &quot;hardly had a chance to succeed&quot;, and &quot;well understand[s] the negative reactions&quot; to his shorts. He believes &quot;They could all have been better animated – truer to the characters – but our T&amp;Js were produced in the early 1960s, near the beginning of my presence here, over a half-century ago as I write this!&quot; Despite the criticism, Deitch&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts are appreciated by some fans due to their uniquely surreal nature. The shorts were released on DVD in 2015 in &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Gene Deitch Collection&quot;.

; Production formats
The 1960s entries were done in Metrocolor but returned to the standard Academy ratio and format.

===Chuck Jones era (1963–1967)===
After the last of the Deitch cartoons were released, Chuck Jones, who had been fired from his 30-plus year tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons, started his own animation studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions (later renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts), with partner Les Goldman. Beginning in 1963, Jones and Goldman went on to produce 34 more &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, all of which carried Jones&#x27; distinctive style, and a slight psychedelic influence.

Jones had trouble adapting his style to &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;″s brand of humor, and a number of the cartoons favored full animation, personality and style over storyline. The characters underwent a slight change of appearance: Tom was given thicker eyebrows (resembling Jones&#x27; Grinch, Count Blood Count or Wile E. Coyote), a less complex look (including the color of his fur becoming gray), sharper ears, longer tail and furrier cheeks (resembling Jones&#x27; Claude Cat or Sylvester), while Jerry was given larger eyes and ears, a lighter brown color, and a sweeter, Porky Pig-like expression.

Some of Jones&#x27; &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons are reminiscent of his work with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, included the uses of blackout gags and gags involving characters falling from high places. Jones co-directed the majority of the shorts with layout artist Maurice Noble. The remaining shorts were directed by Abe Levitow and Ben Washam, with Tom Ray directing two shorts built around footage from earlier &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons directed by Hanna and Barbera, and Jim Pabian directed a short with Maurice Noble. Various vocal characteristics were made by Mel Blanc, June Foray and even Jones himself. These shorts contain a memorable opening theme, in which Tom first replaces the MGM lion, then is trapped inside the &quot;O&quot; of his name.

Though Jones&#x27;s shorts were generally considered an improvement over Deitch&#x27;s, they had varying degrees of critical success. MGM ceased production of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts in 1967, by which time Jones had moved on to television specials and the feature film &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. The shorts were released on DVD in 2009 on &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot;.

===&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; hit television===
Beginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons began to appear on television in heavily edited versions. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two Shoes and remove her by pasting over the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat white Irish woman. Occasionally, as in &quot;Saturday Evening Puss&quot;, a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by June Foray. 

Recent telecasts on Cartoon Network and Boomerang retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by Thea Vidale to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks. The standard &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; opening titles were removed as well. Instead of the roaring MGM Lion sequence, an opening sequence featuring different clips of the cartoons was used instead. The title cards were also changed. A pink title card with the name written in white font was used instead.

Debuting on CBS&#x27; Saturday morning schedule on September 25, 1965, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; moved to CBS Sundays in 1967 and remained there until September 17, 1972.

===Second Hanna-Barbera era: &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; (1975–1977)===
In 1975, Tom and Jerry were reunited with Hanna and Barbera, who produced &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; for Saturday mornings. These 48 seven-minute cartoon shorts were paired with &quot;Grape Ape&quot; and &quot;Mumbly&quot; cartoons, to create &quot;The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape Show&quot;, &quot;The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tom and Jerry/Mumbly Show&quot;, all of which initially ran on ABC Saturday mornings between September 6, 1975, and September 3, 1977. In these cartoons, Tom and Jerry, now with a red bow tie, who had been enemies during their formative years, became nonviolent pals who went on adventures together, as Hanna-Barbera had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children&#x27;s TV. This format has not been used in newer Tom and Jerry entries.

===Filmation era (1980–1982)===
Filmation Studios were commissioned by MGM Television to produce a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; TV series, &quot;The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show&quot;, which debuted in 1980 and featured new cartoons starring Droopy, Spike, Slick Wolf, and Barney Bear, not seen since the original MGM shorts. The Filmation &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were noticeably different from Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s efforts, as they returned &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; to the original chase formula, with a somewhat more &quot;slapstick&quot; humor format. This incarnation, much like the 1975 version, was not as well received by audiences as the originals, and lasted on CBS Saturday mornings from September 6, 1980, to September 4, 1982.

===Tom and Jerry&#x27;s new owners===
In 1986, MGM was purchased by WTBS founder Ted Turner. Turner sold the company a short while later, but retained MGM&#x27;s pre-1986 film library. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; became the property of Turner Entertainment Co., where the rights stand today via Warner Bros., and have in subsequent years appeared on Turner-run stations, such as TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, The WB, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies.

===Third Hanna-Barbera era: &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; (1990–1994)===
One of the biggest trends for Saturday morning television in the 1980s and 1990s was the &quot;babyfication&quot; (child versions) of classic cartoon stars. On March 2, 1990, &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, co-produced by Turner Entertainment Co. and Hanna-Barbera Productions, which was sold to Turner in 1991, debuted on Fox Kids, and aired for a few years on British children&#x27;s block, CBBC. It featured a youthful version of the famous cat-and-mouse duo chasing each other. As with the 1975 H-B series, Jerry wears his red bowtie, while Tom now wears a red cap. Spike and his son Tyke, who now had talking dialogue, and Droopy and his son Dripple, appeared in back-up segments for the show, which ran until November 18, 1994. &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; was the last &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon series produced in 4:3 (full screen) aspect ratio.

===One-off productions (2001; 2005)===
In 2001, a new television special titled &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat&quot; premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom&#x27;s owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not &quot;blame everything on the mouse&quot;.

In 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, titled &quot;The Karate Guard&quot;, which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, storyboarded by Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt, and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005, as part of the celebration of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;″s sixty-fifth anniversary. This marked Barbera&#x27;s first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna&#x27;s original MGM cartoon shorts, and last overall. He died shortly after production ended. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on the Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006. The short was filmed in the standard Academy ratio and format.

===Warner Bros. era (2006–present)===
In 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, the parent company of Warner Bros. The characters from the MGM library, including &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, were placed under the control of Warner Bros. Animation. A relaunch of the theatrical shorts series was planned for 2003 alongside a similar relaunch of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; theatrical shorts, but was canceled after the financial failure of &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;.

In 2006, a new series called &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; premiered. Thirteen half-hour episodes each consisting of three shorts were produced. Some of the segments, like &quot;The Karate Guard&quot;, had originally been produced and completed in 2003 as part of the planned theatrical cartoon relaunch. The show debuted in markets outside the US and UK, before premiering in February 2006 on the UK version of Boomerang, and the following autumn in the US on Kids&#x27; WB on The CW. &quot;Tales&quot; is the first &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the slapstick. &quot;Tales&quot; is the first &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; production produced in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio, but was cropped to 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio when initially aired on in the United States. The series was canceled in 2008, shortly before the Kids&#x27; WB block shut down.

Cartoon Network, which began rerunning &quot;Tom and Jerry Tales&quot; in January 2012, subsequently launched a series titled &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; consisting of two 11-minute shorts, later produced as separate 7-minutes length episodes, per episode that likewise sought to maintain the look, core characters and sensibility of the original theatrical shorts. Similar to other reboot works like &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; and &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, several episodes the new series brought Tom and Jerry into contemporary environments, telling new stories and relocating the characters to more fantastic worlds, from a medieval castle to a mad scientist&#x27;s lab. The series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, with Sam Register serving as executive producer in collaboration with Darrell Van Citters and Ashley Postlewaite at Renegade Animation. Originally slated for a 2013 Cartoon Network premiere, the series was pushed back to April 9, 2014. It is the second &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.

In November 2014, a two-minute sketch was shown as part of the Children in Need telethon in the United Kingdom. The sketch was produced as a collaboration with Warner Bros.

In May 2016, WB Kids began releasing excerpts from various &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; works to the online platform YouTube. By January 2017, compilation videos of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; franchise began to be released by WB Kids on the platform.

On February 20, 2021, Warner Bros. released two new shorts onto HBO Max titled &quot;Tom and Jerry Special Shorts&quot; to honor the 81st anniversary of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, as well as to promote the 2021 film. These shorts share the style of the other HBO Max original &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, also produced by Warner Bros. Animation.

A new Tom and Jerry series made its debut on July 1, 2021 as a Max Original on HBO Max, called &quot;Tom and Jerry in New York&quot;, which basically served as a spin-off of &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot; by having the exact same animation style and slapstick, except that the events take place in the city of New York City. It was loosely based on the 2021 film, as the humans in the series were shown with the faces intact.

On November 11, 2022, Cartoon Network in Japan premiered a new series of animated shorts, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; (), marking the first Japanese production based on the property. Featuring the voices of Megumi Aratake (as Tom), Aya Yonekura (as Jerry) and Eri Tanaka (as Tuffy), the shorts were animated by Fanworks in co-operation with Studio Nanahoshi. Ayu handled the character design and Captain Mirai composed the musical scores. The November 11, 2022 premiere coincided with Cartoon Network&#x27;s celebration of Cheese Day, which is organized by cheese industry in Japan.

On July 25, 2023, the Southeast Asian version of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; animated shorts was announced, to be presented on Cartoon Network Asia alongside HBO Asia streaming platform HBO GO before it was aired globally. The animated shorts, which was set in Singapore, was produced by Warner Bros. Discovery Asia-Pacific&#x27;s director of original kids content Carlene Tan, with animation by Aum Animation Studios India alongside Singapore-based Robot Playground Media and Chips and Toon Studios for both the stories and designs.

==Outside the United States==
When shown on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom, from April 1967 to February 2001, usually on the BBC, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were not edited for violence, and Mammy was retained. As well as having regular slots, mainly after the evening BBC News with around two shorts shown every evening and occasionally shown on children&#x27;s network CBBC in the morning, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; served the BBC in another way. When faced with disruption to the schedules, for example when live broadcasts overran, the BBC would invariably turn to &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; to fill any gaps, confident that it would retain much of an audience that might otherwise channel hop. This proved particularly helpful in 1993, when &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; had to be cancelled due to an IRA bomb scare at BBC Television Centre. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was shown instead, bridging the gap until the next programme. In 2006, a mother complained to Ofcom about the smoking shown in the cartoons, since Tom often attempts to impress love interests with the habit, resulting in reports that the smoking scenes in &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; films may be subject to censorship.

Due to its very limited use of dialogue, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was easily translated into various foreign languages. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; began broadcast in Japan in 1965. A 2005 nationwide survey taken in Japan by TV Asahi, sampling age groups from teenagers to adults in their sixties, ranked &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; No. 85 in a list of the top 100 &quot;anime&quot; of all time. Their web poll taken after the airing of the list ranked it at No. 58 – the only non-Japanese animation on the list, and beating anime classics like &quot;&quot;, &quot;A Little Princess Sara&quot;, and the ultra-classics &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. In Japan, the word &quot;anime&quot; refers to &quot;all&quot; animation regardless of origin, not just Japanese animation. 

&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; serve as the long-time licensed mascots for Gifu-based Juroku Bank. Unlike some other Western cartoons such as &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;, whose characters had to be doctored to have five fingers in each hand instead of the original four, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; aired in Japan without such edits, as did other series starring non-human protagonists such as &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; have long since been popular in Germany. The different shorts are usually linked together with key scenes from &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1949), in which Tom reads about his and Jerry&#x27;s past adventures. The cartoons are introduced with rhyming German language verse, and when necessary, a German voice spoke the translations of English labels on items and similar information.

The show was aired in mainland China by CCTV in the mid-1980s to the early 1990s and was extremely popular at the time. Collections of the show are still a prominent feature in Chinese book stores.

In the Philippines, the series was aired on ABS-CBN from 1966 until its closure due to the country&#x27;s declaration of martial law in 1972, with the later Hanna-Barbera shorts from Barbecue Brawl to Tot Watchers and all of Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones shorts. RPN aired most of Hanna-Barbera shorts from 1977 until 1989. ABS-CBN would later return to the air after the restoration of democracy in 1986 and air the same shorts as in the pre-martial law era. This lasted until the end of 1988.

In Indonesia, the series was aired on TPI (later re-branded as MNCTV) from the mid-1990s to early 2010s and RCTI during 2000s.

Even though Gene Deitch&#x27;s shorts were created in Czechoslovakia (1960–1962), the first official TV release of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; were in 1988. It was one of the few cartoons of western origin broadcast in Czechoslovakia (1988) and Romania (until 1989) before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.

==Feature films==

Tom and Jerry&#x27;s first feature film appearance was in the 1945 MGM musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, in which Jerry performs a dance number with Gene Kelly. In this scene, Tom made a cameo as a servant. Filmmakers had wanted Mickey Mouse for the scene, but Walt Disney had rejected the deal, as the Disney studio was focusing on its own cartoons to help pay off its debts after World War II. William Hanna and Joe Barbera supervised animation for the scene.

In 1953, Tom and Jerry&#x27;s second feature film appearance was swimming with Esther Williams in a dream sequence in another MGM musical, &quot;Dangerous When Wet&quot;.

On October 1, 1992, the first international release of &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot; arrived when the film was released overseas to theaters in Europe and then domestically by Miramax Films on July 30, 1993, with future video and DVD releases that would be sold under Warner Bros., which, following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Miramax and Turner&#x27;s subsequent merger with Time Warner, had acquired the film&#x27;s distribution rights. Barbera served as creative consultant for the picture, which was produced and directed by Phil Roman. The film was a musical with a structure similar to MGM&#x27;s blockbusters, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. 

In 2001, Warner Bros., which had, by then, merged with Turner and assumed its properties, released the duo&#x27;s first direct-to-video film, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring&quot;, in which Tom covets a ring that grants mystical powers to the wearer, and has become accidentally stuck on Jerry&#x27;s head. It was the last time Hanna and Barbera co-produced a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon together, as William Hanna died shortly after &quot;The Magic Ring&quot; was released.

Four years later, Bill Kopp scripted and directed two more &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; DTV features for the studio, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars&quot; and &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry&quot;, the latter one based on a story by Barbera. Both were released on DVD in 2005, marking the celebration of Tom and Jerry&#x27;s 65th anniversary. In 2006, another direct-to-video film, &quot;Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers&quot;, tells the story about the pair having to work together to find the treasure. Joe came up with the storyline for the next film, &quot;Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale&quot;, as well as the initial idea of synchronizing the on-screen actions to music from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;. This DTV film, directed by Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone, was Joe Barbera&#x27;s last &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; project due to his death in December 2006. The holiday-set animated film was released on DVD in late 2007 and dedicated to Barbera. 

A new direct-to-video film, &quot;Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes&quot;, was released on August 24, 2010. It is the first made-for-video &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; film produced without any of the characters&#x27; original creators. The next direct-to-video film, &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, was released on August 23, 2011, and was the first made-for-video &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; film made for Blu-ray. It had a preview showing on Cartoon Network. &quot;Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse&quot; was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012. 

&quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s Giant Adventure&quot; was released in 2013 on Blu-ray and DVD. &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Lost Dragon&quot; was released on DVD on September 2, 2014. &quot;Tom and Jerry: Spy Quest&quot; was released on DVD on June 23, 2015. &quot;Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz&quot; was released on DVD on June 21, 2016. &quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was released on DVD on July 11, 2017.

A live action/3D animated hybrid film was directed by Tim Story and starred Chloë Grace Moretz, Michael Peña Colin Jost, Rob Delaney and Ken Jeong. The film was released on February 26, 2021.

On December 12, 2024, it was announced that a new animated Tom and Jerry feature film is in the works from Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, with Rashida Jones, Will McCormack and Michael Govier writing the script.

==Controversies==
Like many animated cartoons from the 1930s to the 1950s, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; featured racial stereotypes. After explosions, for example, characters with blasted faces would resemble blackface stereotypes, with large lips and bow-tied hair. Perhaps the most controversial element of the show is the character Mammy Two Shoes, a poor black maid who speaks in a stereotypical &quot;black accent&quot;. Joseph Barbera, who was responsible for these gags, claimed that they did not reflect his racial opinion; they were just reflecting what was common in society and cartoons at the time and were meant to be humorous. Today, the blackface gags are often censored when these shots are aired.

Following the 1949 re-issue of the 1943 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short &quot;The Lonesome Mouse,&quot; the NAACP, which had begun protesting stereotypical and racist depictions of African-Americans in Hollywood cinema, began a campaign against the use of the maid character in the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts. Lillian Randolph left her role as the voice of Mammy Two Shoes in 1952 to instead take a job on television in &quot;Amos &amp; Andy&quot;, and Hanna and Barbera retired the character at that time.

In the 1960s, shorts featuring Mammy Two Shoes were re-animated in part by Chuck Jones&#x27; team at MGM, alongside their work on the newer entries produced by Jones, in order to be shown on television. These versions of the shorts replace the African-American maid with a white woman, voiced by June Foray with an Irish accent. These versions of the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts were broadcast on television until the MGM catalog&#x27;s acquisition by Turner in 1986. Turner redubbed Mammy Two Shoes&#x27; voice in these shorts in the mid-1990s to make the character sound less stereotypical.

Two shorts – &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot;, which depicts cannibals, and &quot;A Mouse in the House&quot;, which shows Mammy getting spanked repeatedly by Tom and Butch in the end resulting in racial abuse – have been removed from circulation. Two others in particular – &quot;Casanova Cat&quot;, which features a scene where Jerry&#x27;s face is blackened by Tom with cigar smoke and he is forced to perform a minstrel dance, and &quot;Mouse Cleaning&quot;, where Tom is shown with blackface speaking in a stereotypical &quot;Negro dialect&quot; – were omitted from DVD/Blu-ray releases. Notably the other two – &quot;Fraidy Cat&quot;, showed Tom biting Mammy in the rear near the end, and &quot;The Mouse Comes to Dinner&quot;, including Jerry briefly dressing up as a Native American stereotype during the beginning – have Mammy edited in complete absence.

At the start of the 2005 &quot;Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Vol 2.&quot; DVD set, a disclaimer by actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg warns viewers about the potentially offensive material in the cartoons. Goldberg&#x27;s disclaimer emphasizes that the racial and ethnic stereotypes present in the shorts were &quot;wrong then and they are wrong today&quot;, borrowing a phrase used in disclaimers done for Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVD sets. This disclaimer is also used in the &quot;Tom and Jerry Golden Collection: Volume 1&quot; Blu-ray/DVD/digital release as well.

Since 2020, all episodes featuring Mammy Two Shoes are no longer seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang and are removed from the Boomerang app. There are other shorts (&quot;The Lonesome Mouse&quot;, &quot;Blue Cat Blues&quot;, and &quot;The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R.&quot;) that are found inappropriate for the intended audiences rather than just having racist contents and are censored from the two channels as well.

In 2006, the British version of the Boomerang channel made plans to edit &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons being aired in the UK where the characters were seen to be smoking. There was a subsequent investigation by UK media watchdog Ofcom. It has also taken the U.S. approach by censoring blackface gags, though this seems to be random as not all scenes of this type are cut. One Gene Deitch-era short, &quot;Buddies Thicker Than Water&quot;, is shortened as one scene involves drunkenness.

In 2013, it was reported that Cartoon Network of Brazil censored 27 shorts on the grounds of being &quot;politically incorrect&quot;. In an official release, the channel confirmed that it had censored only two shorts, &quot;The Two Mouseketeers&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Puss&quot; &quot;by editorial issues and appropriateness of the content to the target audience—children of 7 to 11 years&quot;.

==In other media==
===Comic books===
&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; began appearing in comic books in 1942, as one of the features in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Our Gang Comics&quot;. In 1949, with MGM&#x27;s live-action &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts having ceased production five years earlier, the series was renamed &quot;Tom and Jerry Comics&quot;. That title ran 212 issues with Dell before being handed off to Western Publishing, where it ran until issue #344 in 1984. Tom and Jerry continued to appear in various comic books for the rest of the 20th century. Tom and Jerry comics were also extremely popular in Norway, Germany, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Australia. A licensed European version has been drawn by Spanish artist Oscar Martin since 1986. Another licensed version was published in Yugoslavia, started in 1983 and drawn by a number of artists, including Zoran Kovačević, Bojan Đukić, Zdravko Zupan and Dušan Reljić.

===Comic strip===

A &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; comic strip was syndicated from 1950 to 1952. Although credited to MGM animation studio head Fred Quimby, experts believe the strips were ghosted by Gene Hazleton and possibly Ernie Stanzoni and Dan Gormley. Tom and Jerry was revived as a comic strip from 1989 to 1994, syndicated to the South American market by Editors Press Service. The strip was produced by Kelley Jarvis during this era, with the exception of a short period in 1990–1991 when it was done by Paul Kupperberg &amp; Rich Maurizio.

===&quot;Tom to Jerry: Nanairo&quot;===
Tom to Jerry: Nanairo () is a short-lived series of Japanese comics authored by Chara Chara Makiart as a spin-off of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. It was first featured in the August 2021 issue of the &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; magazine. &quot;Nanairo&quot;, along with Chara Chara Makiart&#x27;s other project &quot;Harapeko Penguin Cafe&quot;, was cancelled in December 2021 as Kodansha (&quot;Nakayoshi&quot;″s publisher) has terminated its contract with the creative unit after one of Makiart members was found guilty for sexually assaulting a minor.

===Video games===
===Musical adaptation===
A musical, or , adaptation of the cartoon series, titled , debuted in Japan in 2019 in advance of the series&#x27; upcoming 80th anniversary. The musical was composed by Masataka Matsutoya, staged by Seiji Nozoe, and written by Shigeki Motoiki.

==Cultural influences==
Throughout the years, the term and title &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related &quot;cat and mouse fight&quot; metaphor has. Yet in &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; it was not the more powerful Tom who usually came out on top. In 2005, TV Asahi ranked &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; as 58th of the Top 100 Animated TV Series in Japan overall, outranking titles like &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, &quot;Initial D&quot;, and even &quot;Macross&quot;. In January 2009, IGN named &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.

===In popular culture===
In 1973, the magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot; referenced &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; in a violence-filled comic book parody, &quot;Kit &#x27;n&#x27; Kaboodle&quot;. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show&quot; is a spoof of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;—a &quot;cartoon within a cartoon&quot;. In an episode of the series titled &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, &quot;Worker and Parasite&quot;, a replacement cartoon for &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;, is a reference to Soviet-era animation.

In an interview found on the DVD releases, several &quot;Mad TV&quot; cast members stated that &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; is one of their biggest influences for slapstick comedy. Also in the Cartoon Network show &quot;MAD&quot;, Tom and Jerry appear in three segments: &quot;Celebrity Birthdays&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse Exterminator Service&quot;, and &quot;Tom and Jury&quot;. Johnny Knoxville from &quot;Jackass&quot; has stated that watching &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; inspired many of the stunts in the films.

The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei likened the rivalry between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tom and Jerry, with the United States in the role of Tom and Iran in the role of Jerry.

==Home media==
In the pre-video era, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were a popular subject for 8mm home movies, with the UK-based Walton Films issuing dozens of titles as colour one-reel Super 8 films, in both silent and sound editions. Walton&#x27;s agreement with MGM obligated them to release the films in slightly edited form, even though the single-reel format would have comfortably accommodated the cartoons&#x27; seven to eight minute running time. These releases were discontinued before the dawn of the 1980s.
As early as 1981, MGM/CBS released &quot;Tom and Jerry Cartoon Festival&quot;, the very first &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; release on numerous home video formats, including VHS, Betamax, CED Videodisc, and Laserdisc, and mostly consisted the original Hanna-Barbara-era shorts (excluding the CinemaScope cartoons). The VHS and Beta versions released a total of four volumes up through 1984, while releases on the other two formats were discontinued after the second volume due to marketing difficulties of Laserdisc and CED players during that time period. 

Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, MGM/UA Home Video released a series of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; VHS tapes under their &quot;Cartoon Movie Stars&quot; banner. Also in the early 1990s, MGM/UA released a released three volumes of Laserdisc box sets for collectors, entitled &quot;The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;. Volumes 1 and 2, contain all of the Hanna and Barbera era shorts in chronological order, with the CinemaScope shorts being presented in letterboxed versions. The cartoons were mostly presented uncut with three exceptions: &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot;, where the cannibal&#x27;s dialogue had been removed, &quot;Saturday Evening Puss&quot;, which is the re-drawn version with June Foray&#x27;s voice added, and &quot;The Framed Cat&quot; where Mammy-Two Shoes&#x27; dialogue had been redubbed. A third volume to &quot;The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry&quot; was released and contains all of the Chuck Jones-era &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, however ommitted any of the Gene Deitch-era shorts. This was the final home media release of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; release by MGM.

In 1999, three years after Time Warner&#x27;s acquisition of Turner Broadcasting, the rights to &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; (along with the rest of MGM&#x27;s Pre-1986 library) moved from MGM to Warner Bros. with Warner Home Video handling all future releases. DVD and Blu-Ray releases of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; have encountered difficulties in terms of restoration, due to most of the original film negatives being destroyed in vault fire in the 1970s, leaving only inferior duplicate copies.

In April 2004, Warner Home Video released &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Classic Collection&quot; in Regions 2 and 4; a six disc double-sided DVD box-set in the United Kingdom, and 12 single-layer individual DVD volumes issued throughout Western Europe and Australia. The set includes almost every single &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon released between 1940 and 1967 in chronological order; with the exceptions of &quot;The Million Dollar Cat&quot; and &quot;Busy Buddies&quot;, were not included for unexplained reasons. The cartoons on this set were sourced from unrestored 1980s Turner broadcast prints as seen on TNT and Cartoon Network, and therefore many of the shorts were censored: with many blackface gags being cut (including &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot; being heavily edited) and almost all of Mammy Two Shoes&#x27; dialogue being redubbed by Thea Vidale. Also the CinemaScope cartoons were presented in 4:3 pan and scan, with the exceptions of &quot;The Egg and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Tops with Pops&quot; and &quot;Feedin&#x27; the Kiddie&quot; which were released in non-anamorphic widescreen as seen on &quot;The Art of Tom and Jerry&quot; laserdiscs. &quot;The Classic Collection&quot; also contained no bonus material. Unlike the U.S. DVDs however, &quot;Mouse Cleaning&quot; and &quot;Casanova Cat&quot; were included on these sets and were presented uncut.

There have been several &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; DVDs released in Region 1 (United States and Canada), such as the &quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s Greatest Chases&quot; DVDs. In October 2004, Warner Home Video released the first volume of &quot;Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection&quot;; a two-disc set with an assortment of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons presented in random order. Much like the U.K &quot;Classic Collection&quot; most of the cartoons were unrestored and sourced from the &#x27;80s Turner prints, however the CinemaScope cartoons were restored in their correct 2.35:1 aspect ratios and released in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. The &quot;Spotlight Collection&quot; also contained numerous special features. In October 2005, Volume 2 of the &quot;Spotlight Collection&quot; was released - which much like the first volume had a random assortment of cartoons, sourced from unrestored Turner Prints (except the CinemaScope cartoons), and contained numerous extras - including an introduction by Whoopi Goldberg about the politically incorrect content in some cartoons. Despite this however, some of the cartoons on Volumes 1 &amp; 2 were censored: having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two Shoes dialogue. Warner Home Video eventually offered a disc replacement program offering fixing these errors, and modern pressings of Volumes 1 &amp; 2 present the cartoons uncut. A third and final volume of the &quot;Spotlight Collection&quot; was released in September 2007 - bringing a total of 112 of the 114 original Hanna and Barbera-era &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts having been released. Volume 3 received a negative response from fans due to &quot;His Mouse Friday&quot; being edited (with an extreme zoom-in towards the end to avoid showing a pygmy cannibal), the CinemaScope cartoon &quot;Pup on a Picnic&quot; being cropped to 16:9, and the cartoons &quot;Mouse Cleaning&quot; and &quot;Casanova Cat&quot; being excluded from these sets due to brief blackface gags.

In October 2011, Warner Home Video released the first volume of the &quot;Tom and Jerry Golden Collection&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray. Unlike the &quot;Spotlight Collections&quot;, the &quot;Golden Collections&quot; were aimed at adult collectors. This time the cartoons were presented uncut, in chronological order and restored from CRI negative elements resulting in a much more pristine image quality. Despite this however, 12 cartoons (&quot;Puss N&#x27; Toots&quot;, &quot;The Bowling Alley Cat&quot;, &quot;Sufferin&#x27; Cats&quot;, &quot;The Lonesome Mouse&quot;, &quot;The Zoot Cat&quot;, &quot;The Million-Dollar Cat&quot;, &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Dog&quot;. &quot;Mouse Trouble&quot;, &quot;Quiet Please!&quot;, &quot;The Milky Waif&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Puss&quot; and &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Diary&quot;) were sourced from 1960s Metrocolor prints, resulting in a washed out image, which drew some critisism from fans and collectors. A second volume of the &quot;Golden Collection&quot; series was schedueled to be released on June 2013. However, in February 2013, it was announced by TVShowsOnDVD.com that - much like the &quot;Spotlight Collections&quot; - &quot;Mouse Cleaning&quot; and &quot;Casanova Cat&quot; would not be included. Many collectors and fans posted negative reviews of the product on Amazon and other various websites, which eventually led Wanrer Home Video to cancel Volume 2 and the &quot;Golden Collection&quot; series. The transfers made for Volume 2 (excluding &quot;Mouse Cleaning&quot; and &quot;Casanova Cat&quot;), were eventually made avaiable on the ITunes Store and YouTube Movies.

Prior to 2015, the Gene Deitch-era &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts saw limited availablity on home media, with the most notable release being on the U.K. &quot;Classic Collection&quot; box-set. On June 2, 2015, Warner Home Video released &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Gene Deitch Collection&quot; DVD which contained all thirteen shorts as well as special features. The Chuck Jones-era &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts were released in a two-disc set titled &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection&quot; in June 2009.

On February 2025, to coincide with &quot;Tom and Jerry&#x27;s&quot; 85th Anniversary, Warner Archive Collection released &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Complete CinemaScope Collection&quot;, a single disc Blu-Ray set which contained all 23 CinemaScope &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons presented in their correct aspect ratios - including &quot;Pup on a Picnic&quot;. The set also inclued three non-&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; CinemaScope cartoons by Hanna and Barbera - &quot;Good Will to Men&quot; (1955), &quot;Give and Tyke&quot; and &quot;Scat Cats&quot; (both 1957) - which were included as extras. This set received mostly positive feedback from fans and collectors.

<text>Wounded in action (WIA) describes combatants who have been wounded while fighting in a combat zone during wartime, but have not been killed. Typically, it implies that they are temporarily or permanently incapable of bearing arms or continuing to fight. Generally, the Wounded in Action are far more numerous than those killed. Common combat injuries include second and third-degree burns, broken bones, shrapnel wounds, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, nerve damage, paralysis, loss of sight and hearing, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and limb loss.

For the U.S. military, becoming WIA in combat generally results in subsequent conferral of the Purple Heart, because the purpose of the medal itself (one of the highest awards, military or civilian, officially given by the American government) is to recognize those killed, incapacitated, or wounded in battle.

==NATO&#x27;s definitions==

===Wounded in action===
A battle casualty other than &quot;killed in action&quot; who has incurred an injury due to an external agent or cause. The term encompasses all kinds of wounds and other injuries incurred in action, whether there is a piercing of the body, as in a penetrating or perforated wound, or none, as in the contused wound; all fractures, burns, blast concussions, all effects of biological and chemical warfare, the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation or any other destructive weapon or agent.

===Died of wounds received in action===

A battle casualty who later dies of wounds or other injuries received in action, after having reached a medical treatment facility. In the United States the acronym used is DOW, while NATO uses DWRIA.

<text>Matthew Thomas Morgan (born September 10, 1976) is an American politician and retired professional wrestler. He is the former mayor and current deputy mayor of the city of Longwood, Florida and is a former gladiator on &quot;American Gladiators&quot;. As a wrestler, he is known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he performed on the SmackDown brand, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is a two-time TNA World Tag Team Champion.

==Early life==
Matthew Thomas Morgan was born in Fairfield, Connecticut on September 10, 1976.

After a successful high school basketball career at Fairfield High School in Connecticut, Morgan played Division I college basketball for Monmouth University at center position. During Morgan&#x27;s freshman year at the university, the Monmouth Hawks defeated Rider University to become the Northeast Conference champions. By winning the conference tournament, Monmouth received an automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA tournament.

Of his trip to the tournament, Morgan said, &quot;it was fun to be able to say that you actually played in the NCAA tournament and actually got some minutes. I didn’t score, but at least I got in as a freshman, which was cool.&quot; Monmouth lost to Marquette University in the first round of the tournament by a final score of 68–44.

Following a coaching change at Monmouth, Morgan transferred to Chaminade University in Hawaii, where he finished his college basketball career and graduated in public speaking. While at Chaminade, Morgan played in the Maui Invitational against the number one ranked Duke Blue Devils.

Morgan participated in tryouts for the NBA teams Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors, but he was not offered a contract by either team.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2005)===

====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2002–2003)====
Morgan was first introduced to the World Wrestling Federation when he entered as part of its &quot;Tough Enough II&quot; program but left the show early due to an injury. In April 2002, Morgan signed a developmental deal with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He made his OVW debut on October 2, 2002, at the OVW TV Tapings as &quot;The Blueprint&quot; Matt Morgan teaming with Mark Jindrak, defeating Travis Bane and Lance Cade. He wrestled there sporadically (usually winning handicap matches) until October 2003 when he was called up to the SmackDown brand.

====SmackDown (2003–2004)====
Prior to his WWE main roster debut, Morgan was originally earmarked to become Kane&#x27;s storyline brother named &quot;Abel&quot; wearing a mask even though the plans were scrapped and a similar role was given to Drew Hankinson years later.

Morgan then made his debut on the October 30, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and was chosen with the returning Nathan Jones by then General Manager of SmackDown!, Paul Heyman, to join Team Lesnar, which consisted of Morgan, Jones, Brock Lesnar, Big Show and A-Train. It was hinted that Morgan and Jones would be a tag team, but their only tag team match was at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, when they took on Team Angle (not the stable introduced one year earlier, but a one-off combination of five wrestlers). They lost to Team Angle in a ten-person elimination tag team match at Survivor Series; Morgan was eliminated from the match by Kurt Angle after Angle gave Morgan an &quot;Angle Slam&quot;. Morgan was then used to make run-ins along with the other members of Team Lesnar, helping Lesnar against his opponents.

Soon thereafter, Jones quit WWE, so Morgan occasionally teamed with Lesnar. He teamed up with Lesnar, Big Show, and Rhyno in a four-on-two Handicap match against Chris Benoit and John Cena on the January 22, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, in a losing effort. On January 25, he competed in the 2004 Royal Rumble match, in which the winner would get a title shot against their brand&#x27;s champion at WrestleMania XX; he eliminated The Hurricane but was eliminated by Chris Benoit.

====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004–2005)====
After Brock Lesnar quit WWE, Morgan was written off television with an unmentioned injury and sent back to OVW for further development and experience, wrestling again as &quot;The Blueprint&quot; Matt Morgan and on April 14, 2004, he defeated Nick Dinsmore to become the OVW Heavyweight Champion. He held the title for almost six months before losing it to Chris Cage on October 13, 2004. Since the stipulation was that if Morgan lost he would &quot;never show his face again&quot; in OVW, he began wearing a mask to the ring and tweaked his name to simply The Blueprint. He would regain the OVW Heavyweight Championship on April 13, 2005, at an OVW live event after defeating Elijah Burke, but lost the title 17 days later to Brent Albright on April 30 after Albright hit Morgan with a crowbar.

====SmackDown (2005)====
Morgan returned to WWE on the April 21, 2005, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, with a new gimmick as a stuttering big-man who was defensive over his speech disorder, and quickly defeated a then-unknown jobber, Brett Matthews. On the May 19 episode of &quot;Smackdown!&quot;, he allied himself with Carlito and became his &quot;backup&quot;. Morgan helped Carlito defeat Big Show at Judgment Day, using Lesnar&#x27;s former finisher, the F-5. This partnership ended when Carlito was drafted to Raw, and Morgan was subsequently released by WWE on July 5, 2005. His last match in WWE was on the July 7, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; against William Regal, although technically the match never took place as Morgan was attacked by The Mexicools before Regal ever got to the ring.

===Japanese and European promotions (2005–2007)===
Morgan toured with New Japan Pro-Wrestling in late 2005, defeating Yuji Nagata in his debut match. He was being pushed as a &quot;monster gaijin&quot; and along with Brock Lesnar, was expected to become one of NJPW&#x27;s top foreign wrestlers, but plans for this were abandoned when he decided to leave NJPW to go to All Japan Pro Wrestling. Morgan debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling as a member of Taka Michinoku&#x27;s foreigner-oriented RO&amp;D faction. He and Mark Jindrak wrestled for HUSTLE as a tag team under the names of Sodom and Gomora.

Morgan also worked for NWE Wrestling in Italy and Rings of Europe in Austria, where he participated as the Monster Heel in a 20 Men Rumble Match. He and Joe Legend became allies but were unable to defeat Austrian Hero Big van Walter in the end.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2013)===

====Jim Cornette&#x27;s bodyguard (2007–2008)====
Morgan debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the August 7, 2007, episode of &quot;TNA Today&quot;, appearing briefly in the background of a segment featuring Eric Young and Jeremy Borash. On the August 9 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Morgan appeared alongside former TNA Management Director Jim Cornette, with TNA later identifying him as Cornette&#x27;s &quot;backup&quot;. Morgan was the Special Enforcer in the Samoa Joe and Christian Cage match at Bound for Glory, preventing Christian&#x27;s Coalition from interfering as Joe gave Cage his first true defeat in TNA. Morgan had to restrain Tomko and A.J. Styles on the edition of October 18 of &quot;Impact!&quot; when they tried interfering in the main event helping Christian defeat Samoa Joe in a Fight For The Right Qualifying match.

On the April 3, 2008, edition of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, it was revealed that Morgan allowed Team Tomko to add James Storm to their team, giving them a five-to-four advantage heading into Lockdown; however, at the end of the program, it was revealed that Morgan himself had joined Team Cage. The next week, Jim Cornette relieved Morgan of his assistant duties to become a full-time wrestler. With Morgan joining Team Cage, he established himself as a face, and went back to his old OVW nickname, &quot;The Blueprint&quot;. Morgan teamed up with Kip James at Sacrifice as a result of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament draw. They failed to win the tag titles as James and Morgan could not get along long enough. He then began to feud with The Rock &#x27;n Rave Infection after defeating Jimmy Rave in less than two minutes on July 17. Lance Rock immediately challenged Morgan to a match right there, and Morgan squashed him.

====Various alliances and feuds (2008–2010)====

In August 2008 Morgan entered a tag team up with Abyss. The storyline was an additional chapter in the &quot;Abyss&#x27; humanisation&quot; storyline. Since his return to television, Abyss had portrayed an emotionally vulnerable character, exaggerating the meaning behind every gesture he received. Abyss saw Morgan as his best friend and was desperate not to displease him. But Abyss&#x27; new sensitivity made him more naive, thus causing him to make simple errors that cost the team matches. Through time, Morgan would go from understanding to frustrated over Abyss&#x27; errors. They feuded briefly with Team 3D. The duo defeated Team 3D at No Surrender, but lost at Bound for Glory IV in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, which Beer Money, Inc. won. At Final Resolution when Storm hit Abyss with brass knuckles when the referee was distracted. They gained a third opportunity at the belts at Genesis in a three-way match against Beer Money, Inc. and then-champions Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed. During the match, Abyss accidentally knocked Morgan out with one of the championship belts, causing him to be pinned by Beer Money.

On the following &quot;Impact!&quot;, the team fought against Lethal and Creed in a number one contenders match for the tag team championship, which ended with Morgan once again being pinned because of Abyss. On the January 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morgan and Abyss battled Beer Money, Inc. in a non-title first blood match. Towards the end of the match, Morgan turned on Abyss after hitting him with a steel chair, causing him to bleed, giving Storm and Roode the win and turning heel in the process. Morgan was defeated at Against All Odds in a standard match, but defeated Abyss in a Match of 10,000 Tacks at Destination X. The feud ended at Lockdown, in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood Match, in which neither wrestler could be legally pinned were he not bleeding. Morgan won after interference by Abyss&#x27; psychiatrist, Dr. Stevie, by hitting Abyss with a back low blow and then a chokebomb onto a pile of tacks.
The following weeks Morgan began a campaign to convince the heel stable The Main Event Mafia to allow him to join them and become a member. He was aware that the current members of the Mafia were all former World Champions, but realizing that Team 3D, Kip James and Al Snow had been invited into the Mafia (Team 3D refused, and James and Snow were rejected), Morgan felt he should have been invited too. He faced Sting at Slammiversary, but was unable to defeat him and was thus barred from joining the Mafia. At Victory Road he defeated Daniels to regain the Mafia&#x27;s favor. On the August 13, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morgan defeated A.J. Styles in the deciding match of a &quot;Best of Three Series&quot; to secure his place in a triple threat match at Hard Justice also involving Sting and Kurt Angle. He lost at the event after Angle hit him with a steel chair. At No Surrender competed in a re-match that also featured A.J. Styles and Hernandez, who used his &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; contract to include himself in the match, but was removed after a few minutes when he sustained an injury at the hands of Eric Young. During the match, Styles attempted a front flip senton from the apron onto Morgan outside of the ring, at the same moment Angle attempted to attack Morgan, but accidentally got struck by Styles instead. Morgan seemingly took this as a friendly gesture and agreed to assist Angle for the remainder of the match. But when Angle seemed set to win, Morgan turned on Angle and cost him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning into a face in the process. On the September 24, 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morgan cemented his newfound disinterest in the Main Event Mafia when he teamed with Hernandez to defeat Kurt Angle and Eric Young, which also solidified his status as a face. On the following impact, he teamed with former rival Abyss to defeat Kurt Angle and Mick Foley. Another week later, on the edition of October 1 of impact, Matt Morgan defeated Eric Young. On October 5 Morgan announced on his Twitter page that he had signed a new 5-year deal with TNA. Morgan&#x27;s feud with Angle culminated in a singles match at Bound for Glory, where despite Morgan&#x27;s loss, he managed to gain Angle&#x27;s respect. This match practically ended the Main Event Mafia.

Morgan then teamed up with Hernandez and D&#x27;Angelo Dinero and moved on to feuding with Rhino and Team 3D, who accused TNA of favoring the younger talent of the company. At Turning Point, Rhino and Team 3D defeated Morgan, Hernandez and Dinero in a street fight. The next night, the two teams had a re-match which ended the same way after Jesse Neal returned and attacked Hernandez with a steel chair. It was announced that the two teams would face of at Final Resolution in an elimination match, but both teams were required to have four members. Team 3D immediately enlisted Neal, while Dinero pursued Suicide&#x27;s help. Both teams fought in a regular tag match to determine an additional stipulation on the forthcoming match at Final Resolution. The match at Final Resolution would begin as a 4-on-1 handicap match, but if the disadvantaged wrestler survived the first 5 minutes his partners would then join the match, turning it into an eight-man elimination tag team match. Neal pinned Hernandez, meaning that Hernandez and his team would be disadvantaged at Final Resolution. At the pay-per-view Morgan, Hernandez (who survived), Dinero and Suicide defeated Jesse Neal, Team 3D and Rhino, with Morgan scoring the deciding fall on Brother Ray.

On the January 4, 2010, live, three-hour, Monday night episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morgan and Hernandez defeated Dr. Stevie and Raven to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Champions British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) at Genesis. At the pay-per-view Morgan and Hernandez defeated the British Invasion to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship, his first major championship. At Against All Odds as part of the 8 Card Stud Tournament Morgan and Hernandez were forced to face each other in the first round. Morgan defeated Hernandez by taking advantage of his injured shoulder and pinning him, while grabbing a hold of his trunks. However, in the semifinals Morgan was defeated by the eventual winner of the entire tournament, D&#x27;Angelo Dinero. At Destination X Morgan and Hernandez retained the Tag Team Titles in a match against Beer Money despite plenty of miscommunication between the two champions. After the match Morgan nailed Hernandez with the Carbon Footprint and left with both title belts, turning heel in the process. The following day on &quot;Impact!&quot; Morgan defeated Hernandez via referee stoppage after sandwiching his head between his boot and the ring post, putting him out of action indefinitely. With Hernandez scheduled to miss months of action, Morgan declared himself the sole World Tag Team Champion on the edition of April 5 of &quot;Impact!&quot; and TNA went along with this and recognized him as the sole Champion. Morgan then went on to successfully defend the World Tag Team Title while teaming with the likes of Amazing Red, Shark Boy and Jesse Neal as his substitute partners, attacking each of them after the matches. On the edition of May 3 of &quot;Impact!&quot; it was announced that Morgan would defend the World Tag Team Championship at Sacrifice against Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore, both of whom he had attacked in the two previous weeks, and that Hulk Hogan would decide his partner for the match. On the edition of May 13 of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morgan demanded to find out who his partner would be and when he did not get an answer, threatened to turn his match against Generation Me (Jeremy and Max Buck) into a bloodbath. However, Samoa Joe came to the ring to put a stop to this and hit Morgan with a Muscle Buster. This led to The Band coming out and Kevin Nash cashing in his &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; contract, after which he pinned Morgan to make himself and Scott Hall the new World Tag Team Champions. On the edition of June 3 of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Matt Morgan was distracted by somebody in the crowd which cost him a four-way match with Samoa Joe, Sting, and the winner of the match, TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam. The camera&#x27;s immediately showed what was distracting Morgan, but nobody could clearly see who it was, although Taz and Mike Tenay believed it to be Hernandez. The following week, Hernandez made his official return by attacking Morgan. After the attack The Band gave the injured Morgan the rematch he had wanted for the World Tag Team Championship and easily defeated him to retain the title. At Slammiversary VIII Morgan defeated Hernandez via disqualification, when Hernandez was disqualified for shoving the referee, when he had gotten enough of him reprimanding him for going after Morgan. The following month at Victory Road Morgan was defeated by Hernandez in a Steel Cage match.

====Fortune (2010–2011)====
On the edition of August 12 of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morgan joined Ric Flair&#x27;s Fortune (originally spelled ) stable, as he, A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm and Douglas Williams attacked EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. At Bound for Glory Morgan, Styles, Kazarian, Roode and Storm were defeated in a Lethal Lockdown match by EV 2.0 members Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Sabu and Stevie Richards. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan&#x27;s and Eric Bischoff&#x27;s new stable, Immortal. However, Morgan would be kicked out of Fortune after he faced Jeff Hardy for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, turning him into a face. He would have two titles matches at Turning Point and Final Resolution, but he lost both times.
At Genesis Morgan was defeated by Mr. Anderson in a number one contender&#x27;s match. On the edition of February 10 of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morgan received a shot at Anderson&#x27;s TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from the returning Hernandez, who made his first TNA appearance in over six months. On the edition of March 3 of &quot;Impact!&quot; Morgan defeated Hernandez via disqualification. On March 13 at Victory Road, Hernandez defeated Morgan in a First Blood match, after using fake blood on him, following a distraction from a planted fan, later identified as Anarquia, the newest member of Hernandez&#x27;s Mexican America stable. On April 17 at Lockdown, Morgan defeated Hernandez in a steel cage match to win the feud. With his feud with Hernandez behind him, Morgan announced his intention of going for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, but was interrupted by Scott Steiner who claimed to be next in line for the shot, before laying Morgan out with a low blow. On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Morgan defeated Steiner in a singles match. Later that month, Morgan entered the Bound for Glory Series to determine a number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the edition of July 21 of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Morgan won a four-man ladder match to climb to number three spot in the tournament&#x27;s rankings, however, just four days later it was reported that Morgan had torn his pectoral muscle, which would sideline him for six weeks, ending his participation in the tournament. Over the following weeks, Morgan was on commentary for the Bound for Glory Series matches. On August 29 it was reported that Morgan had been cleared to return to the ring.

====Teaming with Crimson (2011–2012)====
Heading to Bound for Glory, Morgan started a feud with Samoa Joe, who had vowed to ruin the Bound for Glory Series. On September 11 at No Surrender, Morgan defeated Joe in a grudge match, but lost against him on the following edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; in a submission match. At Bound for Glory, they would have a triple threat match also including the eventual winner Crimson. On November 13 at Turning Point, Morgan wrestled Crimson to a double disqualification. On the following edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Morgan and Crimson defeated Mexican America to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. They would defend the titles against Mexican America, D&#x27;Angelo Dinero and Devon, and Magnus and Samoa Joe, until February 12, where they lost the championship at Against All Odds against Magnus and Joe in a rematch. They would try to regain the titles two times, but failed. After their second match at Victory Road, when Crimson turned on Morgan. On April 15 at Lockdown, Morgan was defeated by Crimson in a steel cage match. On the edition of May 10 of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Morgan and Crimson were set to face each other in what was billed as their &quot;final confrontation&quot;, however, before the match could start, Morgan was attacked by Bully Ray. After Morgan was stretchered away, Crimson was given a countout victory. In an interview on June 14, Morgan expressed frustration with TNA management and confirmed that his contract with the promotion would be up soon. Working exclusively on house shows for his last month with TNA, Morgan finished his commitments with the promotion on June 16.

====Final feuds and departure (2012–2013)====
Morgan made a surprise return to TNA at a house show in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on September 15, entering through the crowd in street clothes, hopping a guardrail and attacking Robbie E. The following night at another house show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Morgan entered the ring after a match between James Storm and Jeff Hardy, delivering a Carbon Footprint to referee Brian Stiffler. The second appearance was later broadcast on the October 4 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Bruce Prichard was lecturing D&#x27;Lo Brown about the incident. Morgan returned to pay-per-view on October 14 at Bound for Glory, helping Joey Ryan defeat Al Snow to earn a TNA contract thus establishing himself as a heel. The following &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Morgan explained his actions, claiming that Hulk Hogan had not delivered on his promises; Hogan in turn blamed the TNA creative about Morgan&#x27;s treatment. While Morgan continued to vilify Hogan, it was insinuated that Hogan was just trying to rile him up, while secretly backing him. Morgan competed in his return match on the November 29 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Douglas Williams. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Morgan and Ryan unsuccessfully challenged Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Hernandez for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, after losing to them via disqualification. Morgan and Ryan challenged Guerrero and Hernandez again on January 13, 2013, at Genesis, but were again unsuccessful in winning their titles. In March, Morgan began &quot;cleaning up the messes&quot; that Hulk Hogan had made, beginning with attacks on World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy and Joseph Park. The attack on Park resulted in a singles match on the March 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Morgan emerged victorious. On the April 25 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Morgan confronted Hogan and offered his services to take out the Aces &amp; Eights, in exchange for being named the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary, but was firmly denied. The following week, Morgan faced Sting in a number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Sting won after locking Morgan in the &quot;Scorpion Deathlock&quot; and making him pass out. Morgan&#x27;s last appearance for the company was on the June 13 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where he was defeated by Magnus in a four-way 2013 Bound for Glory Series qualifying match, which also included Kenny King and Rob Terry. After initially asking that same month, TNA granted Morgan his release from the company on July 9.

===Independent circuit and first retirement (2013–2014)===
Morgan debuted for AAA on June 16, 2013, at Triplemanía XXI, where he, Jeff Jarrett, and Monster Pain defeated AAA World Trios Champions &quot;Los Psycho Circus&quot; (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) in a non-title match.

Morgan made his first wrestling appearance since departing from TNA on August 31, 2013, at NWA Florida Underground Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Throwdown 6&quot;, defeating Kenneth Cameron. Morgan returned to NWA-FUW on October 26, defeating The Grease to win the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship. In November, Morgan made successful title defenses against Leo Gold, Deimos, and The Titan.

Morgan made his debut for Family Wrestling Entertainment on October 12, 2013, at their Grand Prix iPPV, unsuccessfully challenging John Hennigan for the FWE Heavyweight Championship. Morgan returned to FWE on December 7 for their one-night tournament, losing to Ted DiBiase Jr. via count-out in the opening round.

In January 2014, Morgan announced his retirement from professional wrestling full-time in order to be with his wife and new born son, as well as begin a career as a regional manager for a &quot;big-time medical device company&quot;. Morgan has stated that while he has a great love for professional wrestling and all the opportunities it afforded him, that his biggest dream in life was to be a father and so he had to take a job that allowed him to be home every night with his son, something he unfortunately would not be able to do as a full-time wrestler. In an interview with Chris Van Vliet in February 2023, Morgan also spoke he was intended to return to WWE in the 2014 Royal Rumble event using The Blueprint gimmick he used in TNA but his son was born on January 7, days before the event and plans for it were then shelved.

===Return to TNA (2015, 2017)===
On June 24, 2015, Morgan returned to TNA as a face, after saving the returning Vader from an attack from Bram. It was soon announced that Morgan would face Bram at Slammiversary. At Slammiversary, Bram defeated Morgan after performing &quot;The Brighter Side of Suffering&quot; onto a steel chair. Morgan later confirmed that the match was a one-time deal only in order to give his son the chance to see him wrestle.

On the April 6, 2017 edition of Impact, Morgan made his return as the third pick on Team Jeremy Borash, joining Chris Adonis, Magnus and Alberto El Patrón. The foursome would defeat Team Josh Mathews (Bram, Eli Drake, Lashley and Tyrus) the following week. Morgan&#x27;s next match was for the GFW Global Championship on Impact&#x27;s May 4 episode; he would lose after suffering a low blow followed by a Michinoku Driver from then champion Magnus, solidifying the latter&#x27;s heel turn. This would be Morgan&#x27;s final appearance as he was granted his release request on July 24 by GFW, which was now Impact Wrestling renamed following its merger with Jarrett&#x27;s promotion on April 20. Morgan says he had only agreed to return because Impact was close to his home, only taped on the weekends and did not tour, and therefore would not interfere with his other 9 to 5 career. This changed when GFW started taping its shows on weekdays and planning to travel, and so Morgan wanted out of the promotion.

===Return to the independent circuit and second retirement (2019)===
On March 16, 2019, Morgan returned to the independent circuit where he wrestled the final match of his career, teaming with Deon James to defeat Braydon Knight and Chico Adams with Eric Christopher as their manager in a tag team match.

===Second return to Impact Wrestling (2022)===
On the June 9, 2022, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Morgan made a one night return and was interviewed by Gia Miller to talk about his career with the company until being interrupted by Vincent.

==Political career==
In 2017, Morgan ran for public office, defeating incumbent Mark Weller as District 4 City Commissioner of Longwood, Florida. He changed his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican the same month he filed to run for office in the majority Republican county. He served as mayor of Longwood from May 7, 2019, until September 2020. Morgan ran for Seminole County Commission in 2020 and lost to incumbent Bob Dallari, who received 60.1% of the vote to Morgan&#x27;s 39.9%. He serves as District 4 City Commissioner of Longwood, Florida after his defeat.

Morgan was linked to former tax collector of Seminole County Joel Greenberg, via payments that Greenberg&#x27;s office made to Morgan&#x27;s company, Blueprint Enterprises, for consulting jobs. However, auditors wrote that they could find &quot;no evidence of work product&quot;. Morgan was charged with no crimes. Seminole County commissioners agreed to hire a law firm to attempt to recoup public money misspent by Joel Greenberg.

In May 2022, Longwood city commission meeting, Morgan&#x27;s fellow city commissioners elected Morgan to become the city&#x27;s new mayor. He served as mayor until May 2023, and his term on the Longwood city commission concluded November 2024.

==Personal life==
Morgan announced on a 2008 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; during the TNA Webography segment where TNA Superstars give an insight into their life that he has been married to his college sweetheart, a Hawaiian/Filipino woman named Larissa Vasper from Hawaii for four years. During that Webography, he also announced that when he was five, he was diagnosed with Attention-Deficit Disorder (ADD), which led to him getting involved with CHADD (Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), a non-profit organization based out of Landover, Maryland.

In August 2008, it was announced that Morgan would contribute a sample of his DNA to be launched into space as part of game designer Richard Garriott&#x27;s &quot;Operation Immortality&quot; project.

In 2014, Morgan&#x27;s wife, Larissa, gave birth to their first child.

Since 2016, Morgan has become a regular guest on &quot;The Wrestling Inc.&quot; podcast, reviewing the week&#x27;s latest edition of &quot;Raw&quot; while also covering all WWE&#x27;s pay-per-views and NXT&#x27;s TakeOver events. In 2019, Morgan also started reviewing &quot;SmackDown&quot;, &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, &quot;NXT&quot;, and both WWE and AEW pay-per-views for Wrestling Inc.

==Other media==
In 2008, Morgan accepted an offer to appear on the third series of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; as one of the Gladiators. Morgan, under the name Beast, made his Gladiator debut during the first night of the semifinals in the joust. He defeated each of his two opponents in less than eight seconds. On September 24, 2010, Morgan appeared on Fox television show &quot;The Good Guys&quot;, playing the role of a Russian mobster on an episode titled &quot;Vacation&quot;. In November 2010 Morgan was a contestant on an all TNA week of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, teaming with Jay Lethal, Mick Foley, Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam against Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Lacey Von Erich, Tara and Velvet Sky. On June 30, 2011, Morgan was announced as being a part of the new season of &quot;CMT Made 101&quot;.

<text>White Chicks (stylized as WHiTE CHiCKS) is a 2004 American buddy cop crime comedy film directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans from a screenplay co-written by Wayans, Xavier Cook, Andy McElfresh, Michael Anthony Snowden, with additional contributions by and starring Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans. It also stars Jaime King, Frankie Faison, Lochlyn Munro, and John Heard. In the film, two black male FBI agents go undercover as white women by using whiteface to protect two hotel heiresses from a kidnapping plot targeting socialites.

Principal photography for &quot;White Chicks&quot; took place in Chilliwack and Victoria in British Columbia, and in The Hamptons in New York. It was theatrically released in the United States on June 23, 2004. The film received generally negative reviews upon release, and was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. It grossed over $113.1 million worldwide, and has since come to be regarded as a cult classic.

==Plot==

In New York City, FBI agents Marcus Anthony II and Kevin Copeland inadvertently ruin a drug bust. Their boss, Chief Elliott Gordon, offers them a reprieve if they escort sisters Brittany and Tiffany Wilson safely to a weekend-long fashion event in the Hamptons. The sisters are the rich, shallow socialite daughters of Wilson Cruiseliners CEO Andrew Wilson, whom the police suspect will become the next victims in a string of high-profile kidnappings. On the drive, the sisters&#x27; dog Baby leaps out of the car window, causing Kevin to lose control. The sisters suffer minor facial cuts. With the sisters refusing to be seen with cut faces, Kevin sends them into hiding; he has a makeup expert friend create prosthetic disguises so he and Marcus can replace them.

Kevin as Brittany and Marcus as Tiffany meet the sisters&#x27; three best friends – Lisa Anderson, Karen Googlestein, and Tori Wilson – and their rivals: the Vandergeld sisters, Heather and Megan. Unbeknownst to Kevin and Marcus, they are being watched by colleagues, Vincent Gomez and Jake Harper, and Gordon, who are undercover posing as hotel staff. At the hotel, pro basketball player Latrell Spencer is attracted to Marcus/Tiffany, and Kevin sets his sights on &quot;New York One News&quot; reporter, Denise Porter.

At the Vandergelds&#x27; annual charity auction, Latrell wins a dinner date at a restaurant with Marcus/Tiffany. While Latrell takes Marcus/Tiffany to a restaurant, Kevin, believing Denise likes rich men, pretends to be Latrell and takes Latrell&#x27;s car to drive Denise to Latrell&#x27;s house. There, he hears about criminal Ted Burton turning the tables on Heather and Megan&#x27;s father, Warren. With Kevin becoming romantically involved with Denise and Marcus/Tiffany unsuccessfully trying to reject Latrell, their combined antics put them under Gomez and Harper&#x27;s suspicion.

At a nightclub, after winning a dance-off against the Vandergelds, Kevin and Marcus learn from a drunken Karen that Warren is penniless and has been taking loans from her father, meaning that Warren is the mastermind behind the kidnappings. The next day, the real Brittany and Tiffany arrive at the hotel and discover they are being impersonated. They arrive in the Hamptons, intent on exposing their &quot;clones&quot;, as does Marcus&#x27; wife, Gina, assuming that he is cheating on her. Realizing the Wilsons are being impersonated by men, Gomez and Harper aim to expose them, but accidentally strip down the real Brittany and Tiffany in front of Gordon, resulting in Harper getting punched in the face. After Gomez and Harper are suspended, a furious Gordon fires Kevin and Marcus. Having lost both his job and possibly Gina, Marcus scolds Kevin for always dragging him into trouble.

Later, Kevin and Marcus discover that Warren had embezzled money through his charity. Marcus convinces Kevin to not tell Gordon, to redeem themselves with Gomez and Harper&#x27;s help. Again posing as the Wilsons, they are chosen for the final fashion show. The Vandergelds are furious the Copelands/Wilsons have replaced them on the catwalk, but the real Brittany and Tiffany also perform in the event. Karen rejects the callous Heath, and Marcus punches him in the face. During the show, the Vandergeld sisters try to sabotage their &quot;rivals&quot;, but end up being humiliated by Karen, Lisa, and Tori.
The real Brittany and Tiffany appear and expose Kevin and Marcus, causing mass confusion. Warren begins the kidnapping, but incorrectly captures Marcus/Tiffany and Brittany. This begins a fight between the brothers and Heath and Russ, accomplices in the kidnappings. Warren soon captures the real sisters and explains his financial troubles to his wife and daughters, unaware that his confession is being filmed. In the ensuing scuffle, Kevin is nearly shot trying to protect Denise, Latrell is shot trying to protect Marcus/Tiffany, and Kevin shoots Warren in the shoulder.

Marcus and Kevin capture Warren, while Gomez and Harper apprehend Heath and Russ. Afterward, their true identities are revealed, and Latrell is dismayed that Marcus is not white, not that he is a man. Warren, Heath, and Russ are arrested, while Gordon reinstates the brothers, Gomez, and Harper. Marcus clears things with Gina, Kevin and Denise begin a relationship, and Latrell wins over the real Brittany and Tiffany. Tori, Lisa, and Karen admit they liked Brittany and Tiffany a lot more when Marcus and Kevin were them, and the five agree to remain friends and go shopping together.

==Release==
&quot;White Chicks&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on June 23, 2004. Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released on DVD in the United States on October 26, 2004 and also on UMD on November 29, 2005.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $19.7 million in its opening weekend, taking the #2 spot. It finished with $70.8 million at the box office in the United States, and $42.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $113.1 million, against a budget of $37 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 15, 2004, and opened at #2, behind &quot;Shark Tale&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film was &quot;largely panned&quot; by critics upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 126 reviews, and an average rating of 3.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states that the film is a &quot;scattershot romantic comedy that&#x27;s silly and obvious.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In his negative review, Dave Kehr of &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;Most movies require some suspension of disbelief. But &quot;White Chicks&quot;... requires something more radical than that. A full frontal lobotomy might be a good place to start.&quot; Film critic Richard Roeper put the film at #1 on his list of the worst films of 2004, amongst claims of unconvincing prosthetics and racism. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 1 and stars out of four and said &quot;Here is a film so dreary and conventional that it took an act of the will to keep me in the theater.&quot; He subsequently named the film the seventh worst film of 2004. Owen Gleiberman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;A tawdry excuse for a movie, but it has a handful of shameless giggles&quot;, and rated the film &quot;C+&quot;.

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review, and stated that the film &quot;scores more hits than misses.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Mike Clark rated it 3/4, and said &quot;As with every other genre, there&#x27;s a right way and a wrong way to handle dude-lawman romantic comedies. &quot;Chicks&quot; does it right a lot of the time.&quot;

&quot;White Chicks&quot; was nominated for five Razzies, including Worst Picture, Worst Actress for the Wayans brothers in drag, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay and Worst Screen Couple. It lost in all categories to &quot;Catwoman&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. At the 2004 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director (Keenan Ivory Wayans), Most Painfully Unfunny romantic Comedy, Worst On-Screen Couple (Shawn and Marlon Wayans), and Least &quot;Special&quot; Special Effects. Its only win was for Most Painfully Unfunny romantic Comedy.

===Legacy===
* The song &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; by Vanessa Carlton became heavily associated with Terry Crews for his performance of it in the film.
* The Film was referenced in Ghosts (American TV series) in the episode Ghostfellas.

==Sequel==

In August 2009, a sequel to the film was announced by Sony, though they later canceled the project. A sequel was confirmed to be in the works in March 2018. On June 30, 2019, Terry Crews confirmed a sequel on the program &quot;Watch What Happens Live&quot;. Marlon Wayans confirmed that this information was not meant to leak, and that the deal had not yet been confirmed. 

On February 23, 2025, Marlon Wayans confirmed in an interview that a sequel would happen after the release of &quot;Scary Movie 6&quot;, saying “I think it&#x27;s time. Let&#x27;s get &quot;Scary Movie 6&quot; done, and then we&#x27;ll go and bring out &quot;White Chicks 2&quot;.&quot;

<text>Marawi, officially the Islamic City of Marawi (Maranao: &quot;Bandar a Marawi&quot;; ; Jawi &quot;(Batang Arab)&quot;: ), is a component city and capital of the province of Lanao del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 207,010 people.

Marawi is located upon the shores of Lake Lanao. It is primarily inhabited by the Maranao people. The city is also called the &quot;Summer Capital of the South&quot; due to its higher elevation and cooler climate, a nickname it shares with Malaybalay.

On May 23, 2017, the city suffered extensive damage during the Siege of Marawi as militants affiliated with the Islamic State invaded the city and engaged in a five-month urban warfare, until when Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced the ending of the battle in October.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dansalan&quot; (Marawi&#x27;s prior name) derived from the Mëranaw word &quot;dansal&quot;, which means rendezvous; literally, it also means arrival (in other source, &quot;where the waves come to shore&quot;). Being known as the destination point for arriving boats, the place refers to a port, hence, the &quot;Place of Destination and Purpose.&quot;

Meanwhile, &quot;Marawi&quot; is derived from the word &quot;rawi&quot;, which means reclining, in reference to Agus River. On the other hand, this present name is in honor of the city&#x27;s martyred hero in Kuta Marahui (Fortress of Marawi) in 1895.

==History==
===As Dansalan===
Dansalan began as a port. A sovereign of Marawi before 1639 was &quot;Datu Buadi Sa Kayo&quot; who imposed taxation.

Around the original Meranaw fortification, Spanish captain Francisco Atienza founded a settlement called &quot;Dansalan&quot; in October 1639. His forces had come from Iligan and were attempting to conquer the entire Lake Lanao area. However, it was abandoned later the same year when thousands of Meranaw soldiers invested the then-fortifying settlement, pressing the Spaniards hard and thus they returned to Iligan, having failed in their quest.

The Spaniards only returned to the area when they began the conquest of the Sultanate of Maguindanao in the 19th century. They made attempts to capture Marawi, a Maranao stronghold, twice until they succeeded in 1895 with the deaths of Datu Amai Pakpak and Datu Sinal. They abandoned the place again upon the arrival of the Americans in the Mindanao in 1898.

Dansalan was created as a municipality by the Moro Province legislative council on May 24, 1907; served as the capital of the undivided Lanao Province since its declaration by the American colonial government.

It was in this municipality when, on March 18, 1935, a group of 189 Maranao leaders and its leader, Hadji Abdulhamid Bongabong of Unayan, signed a document known as the &quot;Dansalan Declaration&quot;, urging then United States President Franklin Roosevelt and its Congress to grant Mindanao and Sulu separate independence by the United States instead of inclusion in the country&#x27;s independence.

===Cityhood and renaming into Marawi===
Dansalan was the last to become a chartered city under the country&#x27;s Commonwealth era with the approval of Commonwealth Act No. 592 on August 19, 1940. During World War II, the Japanese invaded Dansalan and established a &quot;comfort station&quot; in the city, where local girls, teenagers, and young adults were kidnapped and turned into sex slaves under brutal &quot;comfort women&quot; system, where victims were routinely gang-raped and killed by Japanese soldiers. After the Second World War, inauguration took place on September 30, 1950. It was renamed Marawi City on June 16, 1956 through Republic Act (RA) No. 1552 which amended the charter.

Upon division of Lanao province through RA No. 2228 in 1959, it was made capital of Lanao del Sur.

The city, being the country&#x27;s only predominantly Muslim chartered city, was declared &quot;Islamic City of Marawi&quot; through &quot;City Council Resolution No. 19-A&quot; on April 15, 1980. This was proposed by Parliamentary Bill No. 261 in the defunct Batasang Pambansa, the country&#x27;s former parliament during the Marcos regime, reportedly to attract funds from the Middle East.

===Siege of Marawi===

On May 23, 2017, a pro–Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group called the Maute group attacked the city. The Battle of Marawi—also known as the Marawi siege, the Marawi clash, and the Marawi crisis—started on May 23. CNN Philippines reported that the militants had over 500 men. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on the island of Mindanao, where the fighting was taking place, initially until December 31, 2017, but was later extended to the end of 2018 and then again to the end of 2019. The city was liberated from militant control on October 17, 2017 and battle operations officially ended on October 23, 2017.

==== Post-battle period ====
On January 30, 2018, it was announced that a 10-hectare military base will be established in the city to prevent the reentry of terrorists.

==== Creation of additional barangays ====
The 2017 siege resulted to internally displaced persons contributing to a significant population increase in certain &quot;barangays&quot;, later led to the creation of new ones. Since then, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) held two separate plebiscites in the city, eventually establishing five &quot;barangays&quot;.

The plebiscite for the creation of two &quot;barangays&quot; on March 18, 2023, marking the first exclusively local electoral exercise in the city post-siege, was held in five polling precincts. With of registered voters participated, majority of them later ratified the proposal. The creation became effective, months prior to the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections in October.

Another plebiscite, seeking for the creation of three additional &quot;barangays&quot;, was held on March 9, 2024, in eight clustered precincts. With voter turnout, the proposal was ratified, almost unanimously.

<text>Quatermass and the Pit (US title: Five Million Years to Earth) is a 1967 British science fiction horror film from Hammer Film Productions. It is a sequel to the earlier Hammer films &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; and &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;. Like its predecessors, it is based on a BBC Television serial, in this case &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, written by Nigel Kneale. The storyline, largely faithful to the original television production, centres on the discovery of ancient human remains buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground called Hobbs End. More shocking discoveries lead to the involvement of the space scientist Bernard Quatermass.

It was directed by Roy Ward Baker and stars Andrew Keir in the title role as Professor Bernard Quatermass, replacing Brian Donlevy, who played the role in the two earlier films. James Donald, Barbara Shelley and Julian Glover appear in co-starring roles. The film opened in November 1967 to favourable reviews, and remains generally well regarded.

==Plot==
Workers building an extension to the London Underground at Hobbs End dig up a skull. Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney identifies it as a five-million-year-old apeman, more ancient than previous finds. One of Roney&#x27;s assistants uncovers part of a metallic object nearby. Believing it to be an unexploded bomb from the London blitz, they call in an army bomb disposal team.

Meanwhile, Professor Bernard Quatermass learns that his plans for the colonisation of the Moon are to be taken over by the military; they want to establish missile bases in space. Colonel Breen is assigned to Quatermass&#x27;s British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen&#x27;s assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. When another skull is found within a chamber of the &quot;bomb&quot;, they realise that the object itself must also be five million years old. Noting its imperviousness to heat, Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain that the apemen were terrestrial.

Roney&#x27;s assistant, Barbara Judd, goes to the site with Quatermass. She becomes intrigued by the name of the area, recalling that &quot;Hob&quot; is an old name for the Devil. A policeman mentions a legend that the bombed-out house opposite the station is haunted. All three go there to investigate. The policeman is so spooked that he has to leave. Quatermass and Barbara find historical accounts of hauntings and other spectral appearances going back centuries, coinciding with disturbances of the ground around Hobbs End.

A member of the bomb disposal team witnesses a spectral apparition of Roney&#x27;s apeman appearing through the object&#x27;s wall. An attempt to open a sealed chamber in the object using a Borazon drill fails. Later, however, a small hole is seen. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. An examination of their physiology suggests that they came from Mars. They resemble images of the Devil; Quatermass believes that the spaceship is the source of the spectral images and disturbances.

They reveal their findings to the press. Quatermass theorises that the occupants of the spaceship came from a dying Mars. Unable to survive on Earth, they sought to preserve part of their race by creating a colony by proxy, by enhancing the intelligence of and imparting Martian faculties to the indigenous primitive hominids. Quatermass theorizes that the insectoids used medical and surgical techniques that were more advanced than those on present-day Earth. These apemen&#x27;s descendants evolved into humans, retaining the vestiges of Martian influence buried in their subconscious. Breen thinks that the &quot;alien craft&quot; is Nazi propaganda designed to sow fear among Londoners. A government minister believes Breen and decides to unveil the spaceship at a press conference.

The drill operator, Sladden, is later overcome by a psychic force and flees. His mind unleashes telekinetic energy displays, disrupting people and property. He comes to rest in a church, where Judd and Quatermass find him. Sladden had a vision of insect creatures under an alien sky. Sladden saw himself as one of them and felt that he had to flee to save his life. At Hobbs End, Quatermass brings a machine Roney has been working on, which taps into the primeval psyche. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected, he notices that Barbara has fallen under the spaceship&#x27;s influence. Using Roney&#x27;s machine, he records her thoughts. Quatermass presents the recording to the minister and other officials. It shows Martians engaged in what he interprets as a genocidal race purge, to cleanse the Martian hives of all mutations. The minister and Breen dismiss the recording.

A power line later is dropped within the craft, giving it a jolt of electrical energy. The effect and range of the spaceship&#x27;s influence on Londoners increases; they go on a rampage, attacking all those perceived as different, with deadly telekinetic displays of energy. Breen is drawn towards the spaceship and killed by the energy emanating from it. Quatermass falls under the alien control too, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. A small portion of the population turns out to be immune. The psychic energy intensifies, ripping up streets and buildings, while a spectral image of a Martian resembling the image of the Devil of legend towers above London. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises that the Martian energy can be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs a building crane and swings it into the image. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney. The image and its effects on London disappear.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Origins===

Professor Bernard Quatermass was introduced to audiences in two BBC television serials, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1953) and &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955), written by Nigel Kneale. The rights to both these serials were acquired by Hammer Film Productions, and the film adaptations – &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; and &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;, both directed by Val Guest and starring Brian Donlevy as Quatermass were released in 1955 and 1957, respectively. Kneale went on to write a third Quatermass serial – &quot;Quatermass and the Pit –&quot; for the BBC, which was broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. Once again interested in making a film adaptation, Hammer and Kneale, who had by then left the BBC and was working as a freelance screenwriter, completed a script in 1961. It was intended that Val Guest would once again direct and Brian Donlevy would reprise his role of Quatermass, with production to commence in 1963. Securing financing for the new Quatermass film proved difficult. In 1957 Hammer had struck a deal with Columbia Pictures to distribute their pictures, and the companies collaborated on thirty films between 1957 and 1964. Columbia, which was not interested in Quatermass, passed on the script, and the production went into limbo for several years. In 1964 Kneale and Anthony Hinds submitted a revised, lower-budget script to Columbia, but the relationship between Hammer and Columbia had begun to sour and the script was again rejected. In 1966 Hammer entered into a new distribution deal with Seven Arts Productions, Associated British Picture Corporation, and Twentieth Century Fox; &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; finally entered production.

===Writing===
Kneale wrote the first draft of the screenplay in 1961, but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film would not go into production until 1967.

The screenplay is largely faithful to the television original. The plot was condensed to fit the shorter running time of the film, the main casualty being the removal of a subplot involving the journalist James Fullalove. The climax was altered to make it more cinematic, with Roney using a crane to short out the Martian influence, whereas in the television version he throws a metal chain into the pit. The setting for the pit was changed from a building site to the London Underground. The closing scene of the television version, in which Quatermass pleads with humanity to prevent Earth becoming the &quot;second dead planet&quot;, was also dropped, in favour of a shot of Quatermass and Judd sitting alone amid the devastation wrought by the Martian spacecraft.

===Casting===
Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film an unhappy experience, believing Baker had wanted Kenneth More in the role.

James Donald first came to prominence playing Theo van Gogh in &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956) before going on to play a string of roles in the World War II prisoner of war films &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965). Although not playing the title role, Donald was accorded top-billing status.

Nigel Kneale had long been highly critical of Brian Donlevy&#x27;s interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. Several actors were considered for the part, including André Morell, who had played Quatermass in the television version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. Morell was not interested in revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on the Scottish actor Andrew Keir, who had appeared in supporting roles in other Hammer productions, including &quot;The Pirates of Blood River&quot; (1962), &quot;The Devil-Ship Pirates&quot; (1964) and &quot;&quot; (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled: &quot;The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn&#x27;t want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More ... and it was a very unhappy shoot. [...] Normally I enjoy going to work every day. But for seven-and-a-half weeks it was sheer hell.&quot; Roy Ward Baker denied he had wanted Kenneth More, who he felt would be &quot;too nice&quot; for the role, saying: &quot;I had no idea he [Keir] was unhappy while we were shooting. His performance was absolutely right in every detail and I was presenting him as the star of the picture. Perhaps I should have interfered more.&quot; He reprised the role of Quatermass for BBC Radio 3 in &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; (1996), making him the only actor other than Donlevy to play the role more than once.
Barbara Shelley was a regular leading lady for Hammer, having appeared in &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot; (1958), &quot;Shadow of the Cat&quot; (1961), &quot;The Gorgon&quot; (1964), &quot;The Secret of Blood Island&quot; (1964), &quot;Dracula: Prince of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Rasputin, the Mad Monk&quot; (1966) for them. &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was her last film for the company and she subsequently worked in television and the theatre. Roy Ward Baker was particularly taken with his leading lady, telling &quot;Bizarre Magazine&quot; in 1974 that he was &quot;mad about her in the sense of love. We used to waltz about the set together, a great love affair.&quot;

=== Filming ===
By the time &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; finally entered production Val Guest was occupied on &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker&#x27;s first film had been &quot;The October Man&quot; (1947) and he was best known for &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1957) and &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958). Following the failure of &quot;Two Left Feet&quot; (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of &quot;The Human Jungle&quot; (1963–64), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–69) and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; gave him the technical expertise to handle the film&#x27;s significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; and &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; enabled him to give &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; the air of realism it needed to be convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale&#x27;s screenplay, feeling the script was &quot;taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it.&quot; He was also impressed with Hammer Films&#x27; lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he was surprised to find that Hammer&#x27;s core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision-making process fast and simple. &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was the first film for which the director was credited as &quot;Roy Ward Baker&quot;, having previously been credited as &quot;Roy Baker&quot;. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.

Filming took place between 27 February and 25 April 1967. The budget was £275,000 (£ in ). At this time, Hammer was operating out of the Associated British Studios in Elstree, Borehamwood. A lack of space meant that production was relocated to the nearby MGM Borehamwood studio. There were no other productions working at the MGM Studios at this time so the &quot;Quatermass&quot; crew had full access to all the facilities of the studio. Baker was particularly pleased to be able to use MGM&#x27;s extensive backlot for the exteriors of the Underground station. The production team included many Hammer regulars, including production designer Bernard Robinson who, as an in-joke, incorporated a poster for Hammer&#x27;s &quot;The Witches&quot; (1966) into the dressing of his set for the Hobbs End station. Another Hammer regular was special effects supervisor Les Bowie. Baker recalled he had a row with Bowie, who believed the film was entirely a special effects picture when he tried to run the first pre-production conference. Bowie&#x27;s contribution to the film included the Martian massacre scene, which was achieved with a mixture of puppets and live locusts, and model sequences of London&#x27;s destruction, including the climactic scene of the crane swinging into the Martian apparition.

===Music===
Tristram Cary was chosen to provide the score for &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. He developed an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (1955). He said of his assignment: &quot;I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material and a great deal of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!&quot; Cary also recalled that &quot;the main use of electronics in &quot;Quatermass&quot;, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the &quot;thing in the tunnel&quot; gave off ... It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn&#x27;t want to destroy my speakers—I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened.&quot; Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled &quot;The Quatermass Film Music Collection&quot;. The soundtrack was released on yellow vinyl in the UK for Record Store Day 2017.

===Title sequence===
The title sequence of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was devised to be evocative. Kim Newman, in his British Film Institute (BFI) monograph about the movie, states: &quot;The words &#x27;Hammer Film Production&#x27; appear on a black background. Successive jigsaw-piece cutaways reveal a slightly psychedelic skull. Swirling, infernal images are superimposed on bone – perhaps maps or landscapes – evoking both the red planet Mars and the fires of Hell. Beside this, the title appears in jagged red letters.&quot;

==Reception==
===Censors=== 
The script was sent to John Trevelyan of the British Board of Film Censors in December 1966. Trevelyan replied that the film would require an X certificate and complained about the sound of the vibrations from the alien ship, the showing of the Martian massacre, scenes of destruction and panic as the Martian influence takes hold, and the image of the Devil.

===Critical===
&quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; premiered on 9 November 1967 and went on general release as a double feature with &quot;Circus of Fear&quot; on 19 November. It was released in the US as &quot;Five Million Years to Earth&quot; in March 1968. The critical reception was generally positive. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, John Russell Taylor found that, &quot;after a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, things really start hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful, it would seem) to colonize Earth [...] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.&quot;

Paul Errol of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; described the film as a &quot;well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum&quot;, a view echoed by William Hall of &quot;The Evening News&quot; who described the film as &quot;entertaining hokum&quot; with an &quot;imaginative ending&quot;. A slightly more critical view was espoused by Penelope Mortimer in &quot;The Observer&quot; who said: &quot;This nonsense makes quite a good film, well put together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed. What it totally lacks is imagination.&quot; Leslie Halliwell wrote: &quot;The third film of a Quatermass serial is the most ambitious, and in many ways inventive and enjoyable, yet spoiled by the very fertility of the author&#x27;s imagination: the concepts are simply too intellectual to be easily followed in what should be a visual thriller. The climax, in which the devil rears over London and is &quot;earthed&quot;, is satisfactorily harrowing.&quot;

===Box office===
According to Fox records, the film required $1.2 million in rentals to break even and made only $881,000 ($ in ).

==Legacy==
The film was a success for Hammer and they quickly announced that Nigel Kneale was writing a new &quot;Quatermass&quot; story for them but the script never went further than a few preliminary discussions. Kneale did eventually write a fourth &quot;Quatermass&quot; story, broadcast as a four-part serial, titled &quot;Quatermass&quot;, by ITV television in 1979, an edited version of which was also given a limited cinema release under the title &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot;. &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; marked the return to directing for the cinema for Roy Ward Baker.

&quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; continues to be generally well regarded among critics. John Baxter notes in &quot;Science Fiction in the Cinema&quot; that &quot;Baker&#x27;s unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [...] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the drill operator, driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is caught up in a whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.&quot; John Brosnan, writing in &quot;The Primal Scream&quot;, found that &quot;as a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere.&quot; Bill Warren in &quot;Keep Watching the Skies!&quot; said: &quot;The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly.&quot; Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the result &quot;I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film. There are, however, a few things that bother me. ... The special effects in Hammer films were always diabolical.&quot;

It has been suggested that Tobe Hooper&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Lifeforce&quot; is largely a remake of Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. In an interview, director Tobe Hooper discussed how Cannon Films gave him $25 million, free rein, and Colin Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Space Vampires&quot;. Hooper then shares how giddy he was: &quot;I thought I&#x27;d go back to my roots and make a 70 mm Hammer film.&quot;

==Home media release==
Various DVDs of the film include a commentary from Nigel Kneale and Roy Ward Baker, as well as cast and crew interviews, trailers and an instalment of &quot;The World of Hammer&quot; TV series devoted to Hammer&#x27;s forays into science fiction.

A UK Blu-ray was released on 10 October 2011, followed by releases in the US, Germany and Australia.

<text>Penkridge ( ) is a village and civil parish in South Staffordshire District in Staffordshire, England. It is to the south of Stafford, north of Wolverhampton, west of Cannock, east of Telford and south-east of Newport.

The wealthiest establishment in Penkridge in the Middle Ages, its collegiate church building survived the abolition of the chantries and is the tallest structure in the village centre. The parish is crossed towards its eastern border by the M6 motorway and a separate junction north of the M6 toll between the West Midlands and Stoke-on-Trent. Penkridge has a railway station on the West Coast Main Line railway next to the Grade I listed medieval church. Penkridge Viaduct and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal are to either side of Market Street and the Old Market Square and are among its landmarks.

==Definition==
Penkridge is a parish unit within the East Cuttleston Hundred of Staffordshire. Its boundaries have varied considerably over the centuries. The ancient parish of Penkridge, defined in 1551, although it existed in much the same form throughout the Middle Ages, was made up of four distinct townships: Penkridge itself, Coppenhall, Dunston, and Stretton. As a place with its own institutions of local government, the parish was also known as Penkridge Borough.

Penkridge became a civil parish in the 1830s and in 1866 was shorn of the three smaller townships, which became separate parishes. It was constituted as a parish of four distinct constablewicks: Penkridge, Levedale, Pillaton, and Whiston. In 1934, the civil parish exchanged some territory with the surrounding parishes to rationalise the boundaries, acquiring the whole of the former civil parish of Kinvaston in the process. The civil parish was the merger of the following settlements or entirely farmed manors:
*Bickford
*Congreve
*Drayton
*Gailey
*Levedale
*Longridge
*Lyne Hill
*Mitton
*Otherton.
*Penkridge
*Pillaton
*Whiston
==Location==

Penkridge is in the district of South Staffordshire in the county of Staffordshire. It is between Stafford, 5 miles (8 km) to the north and Wolverhampton, south, and lies mostly on the east bank of the River Penk.

The development of Penkridge has been closely linked to its relationship to major routes. The village of Penkridge lies on the medieval route between the county towns of Stafford and Worcester, which also passed through Wolverhampton. The Penkridge section became part of the major stagecoach routes linking London and Birmingham with Manchester and Liverpool and is now subsumed into the A449 road. Just to the south, at Gailey, this route crosses the historically still more important Watling Street, now the A5 road, which linked London to Chester, Wales, and ultimately Ireland. The village was also bisected by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal from 1770. Today Penkridge is grazed on its eastern side by the M6 motorway, the main route between London and the north-west of England and Glasgow.

==Etymology==
The popular etymology of the village&#x27;s name derives it from the River Penk, which flows through it. It was assumed that since the village could be said to stand on a ridge by the Penk, it must derive its name from the river. However, this is to reverse the true derivation. The name of the village, or something like it, is attested many centuries before that of the river. The name &quot;Penk&quot; is actually a back-formation from the name of the village.

The occupying Romans gave their fort in the area the Latin form Pennocrucium. Cameron argues that this, like similar Latinized Celtic names, was passed by the native British directly, orally in its Celtic form, to the later Anglo-Saxon occupiers—not through the medium of Latin. Thus the name Pennocrucium attests the origins of the name Penkridge, but is not its direct origin. In the indigenous Celtic, the name of the village was almost certainly &quot;penn-crug&quot;, meaning &quot;the head (or end) of the ridge&quot;, or &quot;chief hill or mound&quot;, and pronounced roughly &quot;penkrik&quot;. In very early times of Anglian settlement the inhabitants of the district were known as the Pencersæte. In 958, a charter uses the form &quot;Pencric&quot; for the settlement. This is obviously close to the modern &quot;Penkridge&quot;, and both are closer in pronunciation to the Celtic root than to the Latinized form.

The name might reflect the village&#x27;s location at the terminus of the long ridge of land running along the east side of the river. However, this ridge is not actually very prominent and few visitors would perceive Penkridge as a hill town. Modern toponymists have become convinced that the hill in question was more likely a tumulus—prominent in pre-Roman and Roman times, and perhaps much later. Brewer comments that &quot;none is evident in the locality&quot;. However, Margaret Gelling, predisposed to find direct evidence for toponyms in the local landscape, has proposed a precise location for the mound, now destroyed by ploughing, that gave both the village and, ultimately, the river their names. This was a tumulus at Rowley Hill Farm, Ordnance Survey reference GR90251180, approximately , which was still prominent in the 18th century and still discernible in the early 20th. It would have directly overlooked the outlying Roman camp, across the Penk and just north of Pennocrucium on Watling Street, the remains of which are clearly visible in satellite photographs. Certainly, it makes more sense to look for the hill in question in the immediate vicinity of the ancient settlement than that of the modern village, which is well to the north of it. The Rowley Hill tumulus is well documented, and was clearly an extremely important landmark for several millennia.

==Governance==

Penkridge is part of the Stone, Great Wyrley and Penkridge parliament constituency, currently represented by the Conservative Gavin Williamson. However, Penkridge area is a part of South Staffordshire district.

Penkridge is covered by a Non-metropolitan county two-tier system of local government:
:* The District Council, which forms the lower tier, is South Staffordshire, based in Codsall. Penkridge is divided among three wards for elections to the district council: Penkridge North East and Acton Trussell; Penkridge West; Penkridge South East. Before the Local Government Act 1972 brought about the 1974 reform of local government in England and Wales, Penkridge was part of Cannock Rural District.
:* The upper tier is the non-metropolitan county, colloquially shire county, of Staffordshire. Penkridge constitutes a single electoral division of the county.
All of Penkridge&#x27;s councillors are currently Conservative.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Early occupation of the area around Penkridge has been confirmed by the presence of a Bronze or Iron Age barrow at nearby Rowley Hill. A significant settlement in this vicinity has existed since pre-Roman times, with its original location being at the intersection of the River Penk and what became the Roman military road known as Watling Street (today&#x27;s A5 trunk road). This would place it between Water Eaton and Gailey, about SSW of the village. The Roman settlement of Pennocrucium and earlier settlements were in the Penkridge area, but not on the same site as present village of Penkridge.

===Medieval Penkridge===

====Anglo-Saxon origins====

The village of Penkridge dates back at least to the early Middle Ages, when the area was part of Mercia, although the foundation date is unknown. King Edgar in 958, described it as a &quot;famous place&quot;, so it was already of importance by then. In the Tudor period, it was claimed that the founder of the collegiate church of St. Michael at Penkridge was King Eadred (946-55), King Edgar&#x27;s uncle, which seems plausible.

====The importance of the church====

Penkridge&#x27;s church was of central importance to the village from Anglo-Saxon times and the Norman conquest did not change this. It was of a special status.
:* It was a collegiate church: a church served by a community of priests, known as a chapter. The members were known as canons. They were not monks, but secular clergy. In 1086 the Domesday survey found that most of the farm land at Penkridge was held from the king by the nine priests of St. Michael&#x27;s, who had six slaves and seven villeins working for them.
:* It was a chapel royal – a place set aside by the monarchs for their own use – generally to pray and to offer mass for their souls. This made it completely independent of the local Bishop of Lichfield – an institution called a Royal Peculiar. In 1280 Penkridge even shut its doors on the Archbishop of Canterbury, when he tried to carry out a tour of inspection (known as a canonical visitation).
:* It was organised like a cathedral chapter. This happened during the 12th century, probably during the Anarchy of Stephen&#x27;s reign. The reorganised chapter was headed by a Dean. The other canons each received a particular estate to live off, called a prebend, and were known as prebendaries.
:* It was headed by the Archbishop of Dublin from 1226. This was because in 1215 King John gave to Archbishop Henry of London, one of his most trusted administrators, the right to appoint the dean of Penkridge. He made himself dean on the next vacancy, and subsequent archbishops of Dublin automatically became deans of Penkridge.

The collegiate church was the most important local institution for most of Penkridge&#x27;s history: economically powerful and architecturally dominant. All the people of the parish had to be buried there, at considerable cost, so it was where the local magnates installed their memorials. Its area of jurisdiction defined Penkridge parish, which was also the main unit of local government until late Victorian times.

The dean and many of the canons were absentees, so they appointed vicars to act for them locally. The focus of worship was prayer and masses on behalf of the dead, not care for the living. Two priests were employed solely to serve in chantries for the monarch and for the Virgin Mary. By the 16th century, the people of Penkridge themselves subscribed to pay a morrow priest to celebrate a daily mass, so that they could worship. Pastoral care and preaching were not taken seriously until the 16th century or later.
====The grip of the forest====
Large areas surrounding Penkridge were placed by the Norman kings under Forest Law, a savage penal code designed to protect the ecology and wildlife for the king&#x27;s enjoyment. These areas were part of the Royal Forest of Cank or Cannock Chase and were known as Gailey Hay and Teddesley Hay. Forest law kept most of south Staffordshire in an economic straitjacket. Conflicts between the barons and kings in the 13th century forced a relaxation, starting with the first issue of the Forest Charter in 1217. So it was in Henry III&#x27;s reign that Penkridge began to grow economically and probably in population. Local people began to create new fields, called assarts, by clearing the trees and scrub (still a capital crime), and Penkridge acquired an annual fair and weekly market.

====Manors and magnates====
Medieval Penkridge was organised on the manorial system. There were a number of manors within the parish, of varying size and importance, each with its own lord, who owed feudal service to his own overlord, but exercised authority over his tenants. A list of the different medieval manors and estates would include: Penkridge Manor, Penkridge deanery manor, Congreve, Congreve Prebendal Manor, Drayton, Gailey, Levedale, Longridge, Lyne Hill or Linhull, Mitton, La More (later Moor Hall), Otherton, Pillaton, Preston, Rodbaston, Water Eaton, Whiston, Coppenhall or Copehale, Dunston, and Stretton. The largest was the manor of Penkridge itself. King John&#x27;s gift of 1215 to the Archbishop of Dublin included Penkridge manor. The Archbishop decided to divide it, giving about two-thirds to his nephew, Andrew de Blund, and keeping the rest for the deanery. The manor of Penkridge was passed on through the Blund (later called Blount) family and later other families of lay landlords.

The Church had large holdings of land. St. Michael&#x27;s college had not only the deanery manor but also Preston and the Prebendal Manor of Congreve. The other prebends also held lands, but not as lords of the manor. Some manors belonged to Staffordshire monasteries. Burton Abbey held Pillaton, Bickford and Whiston, and also, for a time, Gailey, which later passed to the nuns of Black Ladies Priory at Brewood. Drayton belonged to the Augustinian Priory of St. Thomas, near Stafford.
Most of the manors were quite small and often their owners were fairly minor, although some small manors formed part of the wider holdings of great families. Even the most minor of lords had the right to hold manorial courts and to discipline their tenants, but a wealthy and important lord was like a monarch in his own manor. By the late 14th century the lords of Penkridge manor had obtained charters giving them rights to pursue criminals wherever they wished; to inflict the death penalty; to force tenants to take collective responsibility for offenders; and to confiscate stray livestock.

Just before 1500, the Littleton family make their first appearance in Penkridge. Richard Littleton brought Pillaton into the family&#x27;s possession through marriage and Pillaton Hall was the Littleton family seat for about 250 years, the centre of an expanding property empire. Soon they took on the leases of most of St. Michael&#x27;s church lands and established a family chapel in the church – a statement of their growing importance. They were the most important local representatives of the landed gentry, a class that was to dominate rural life for several centuries.

====Agriculture====

Much of the Penkridge area was cultivated under the open field system, although the actual field names are not documented until 16th and 17th centuries, as they were about to be enclosed. In Penkridge manor, for example, there were Clay Field, Prince Field, Manstonshill, Mill Field, Wood Field, and Lowtherne or Lantern Field, Fyland, Old Field, and Whotcroft, and also common grazing areas, Stretton Meadow and Hay Meadow. There are no detailed records of what was grown in medieval Penkridge. In 1801, when the first record was made, nearly half was under wheat, with barley, oats, peas, beans, and brassicas the other major crops – probably similar to the medieval pattern: farmers grew wheat wherever the land in their scattered strips supported it, and other crops elsewhere, with cattle on the riverside meadows and sheep on the heath.

The early medieval cultivators were mainly unfree, forced to work on the lord&#x27;s demesne in return for their strips in the open fields. From the 14th century wage labour replaced the feudal labour system. By the 16th century, most landowners were renting or leasing most of their land and paying cash for labour to cultivate what remained. In 1535, for example, the manor of Drayton was worth £9 4s. 8d. annually, and the lion&#x27;s share, £5 18s. 2d., came from money rents.

====Fairs, markets and mills====
Fairs and markets were a vital part of the medieval economy, but a royal charter was needed for either, so they were highly profitable to the manors which had the right to hold them. The grant of Penkridge manor to the archbishop of Dublin included the right to hold an annual fair. This right was upheld for the Blund family by Edward I in 1278 and by Edward II in 1312. The date varied, but in the Middle Ages it fell around the end of September and lasted for seven or eight days. It began as a general fair but developed into a horse fair by the late 16th century.

Henry III granted Andrew le Blund a weekly market in 1244. This was challenged by the burgesses of Stafford, who feared competition, but Penkridge kept its Tuesday market for centuries. After 1500 the market declined, expired and was revived several times, also changing days several times. The market place, still so-named but no longer used, was at the opposite end of the village from the church. The modern market is held on the livestock auction site close to Bull Bridge.

Mills were another great source of profit to lords of the manor, who forced their tenants to use them. The River Penk and a number of tributary brooks were able to drive mills. The Domesday Book of 1086 records mills at Penkridge at Water Eaton. A century later there were two mills at Penkridge and one of them was operated by the More family for centuries, as tenants of the dean. A mill is recorded at Drayton by 1194; at Congreve, Pillaton, and Rodbaston in the 13th century; at Whiston in the 14th; and at Mitton in the 15th. These were all corn mills, but in 1345 Water Eaton had a fulling mill, as well as the corn mill.

===Reformation and revolution: Penkridge in Tudor and Stuart Times===

====Dissolution====
The Reformation brought major changes to landownership and social life at Penkridge. First came the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. This swept away Burton Abbey, and its manor of Drayton was sold in 1538 to the Bishop of Lichfield, who wanted it for his nephews. The College of St. Michael was not threatened at first, as it was not a monastery, but Edward VI&#x27;s reign brought a more radical phase of the Reformation. In 1547 the Abolition of Chantries Act decreed the end of the chantry churches and their colleges. St. Michael&#x27;s was still a thriving institution: a major rebuilding was in progress. Its estates enriched the dean (Archbishop of Dublin), seven prebendaries, two chantry canons, an official principal, three vicars choral, three further vicars, a high deacon, a subdeacon, and a sacrist. In 1547 its property was assessed at £82 6s. 8d. annually. All this was swept away in 1548 and the first Vicar of Penkridge, Thomas Bolt of Stafford, was appointed on £16 per annum, with an assistant on £8.

====The Dudley inheritance====


Penkridge now became enmeshed in the meteoric career of John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, a key figure in Edward VI&#x27;s regency council. In 1539, Dudley got control of Penkridge manor by foreclosing on a debt its owners, the Willoughby de Broke family, had owed to his father, Edmund Dudley. Next he grabbed the Deanery Manor and Tedesley Hay, making him the most important landowner in the area, although day-to-day management of the deanery lands stayed with the Littletons, the lessees. Dudley went on to seize almost absolute power in England, and taking the title Duke of Northumberland. Edward&#x27;s early death in 1553 left Dudley high and dry. Edward&#x27;s older sister, the Catholic Mary, succeeded but Dudley attempted a coup d&#x27;état in favour of Lady Jane Grey. Mary prevailed and Dudley was arrested and beheaded as a traitor. His lands were forfeit to the Crown, the extensive estates at Penkridge among them.

Dudley had the foresight to grant various estates to his relatives. So his daughter-in-law, Anne Dudley, Countess of Warwick, was able to keep a lifetime interest in Penkridge, while his wife hung on to Teddesley Hay until her death. Teddesley was bought by Sir Edward Littleton in 1555. A new Sir Edward succeeded in 1558 and his vigorous enclosure policy soon stirred up controversy. Penkridge manor entered into a limbo, prolonged by Anne&#x27;s insanity. The fate of the deanery manor too was unresolved: it was taken from the Dudleys, but not restored to the Church, as Mary did not re-establish the chantries. So both remained with the Crown for a generation, with no decision on their fate. Not until the 1580s were matters resolved. In 1581 the college property was sold to speculators and in 1585 it was snapped up by Sir Edward Littleton. In 1582, Queen Elizabeth promised Penkridge manor to Sir Fulke Greville, heir to the Willoughby de Brokes, and he took over 1590.

====Civil war====
The Grevilles were powerful regionally and nationally. The Fulke Greville who inherited Penkridge in 1606 was a poet and statesman. He served both Elizabeth and James I, who gave him Warwick Castle as a seat and elevated him to the peerage as the 1st Baron Brooke. In 1628 he was murdered by a servant. As he was unmarried and childless, he had adopted his younger cousin Robert as his son and heir to both the title and the great estates in Staffordshire and Warwickshire. Robert was a leading parliamentarian and a Puritan, who promoted emigration to America. When the English Civil War broke out, he took command of a parliamentary army in central England and was killed during the siege of Lichfield Cathedral in 1643. He was succeeded by Francis Greville, 3rd Baron Brooke.

The Littletons were purely local landowners and instinctively loyalist. Sir Edward Littleton was made a Baronet by Charles I on 28 June 1627 and was expelled from the House of Commons in 1644 for his royalist sympathies. In May 1645, royalist troops quartered in Penkridge were expelled by small parliamentary force after a brief skirmish. Littleton&#x27;s estates were sequestrated but he was able to recover them on payment of £1347. The Littletons&#x27; holdings were thus preserved and they found themselves in favour again after the restoration of Charles II in 1660. Despite the revolutionary turmoil, the real situation in Penkridge was little changed.

An anomaly surviving from before the Reformation was the peculiar jurisdiction of St. Michael&#x27;s. Although the college was long gone, its privileges survived and were vested in the Littletons, owners of the deanery manor. They appointed vicars and kept bishops at bay, until the royal peculiar was ended in 1858.

===Changing fortunes: Georgian and Victorian Penkridge===


====Economy and population====

In 1666, the township of Penkridge had 212 households and the rest of the parish about a hundred, giving a total population of perhaps 1,200 to 1,500. By the first census, in 1801, it was 2,275. It rose to a peak of 3,316 in 1851. A fall thereafter is mainly the result of the parish being reduced in size by the loss of Coppenhall, Stretton and Dunston. Penkridge itself seems to have had a fairly stable population for the century from 1851 to 1951: a decline relative to the country as a whole, but not a collapse.

From the 1660s the pace of enclosure quickened, with all of the manors being divided into small farms, usually with the cultivators&#x27; consent, and these aggregated gradually into larger units. The second half of the 19th century, and especially the last quarter, were hard times for agriculture, with the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the Long Depression from about 1873. The 1831 census found that farmers and agricultural labourers accounted about 60% of the total adult male workforce. Next came shop keepers and artisans, showing that Penkridge remained a small but important commercial centre, although the market had gone. In 1881 agriculture employed about 48% of the working men: a considerable drop. Of the women whose employment is known, 150, the vast majority, were in domestic service – probably mainly with the local gentry. The hospitality industry was quite important, with 40 men working in food and lodging and 15 working with carriages and horses – reflecting the continuing importance of the inns on a major route. The diversity of trades is marked. No less than 43 – 25 women and 18 men – were involved in dress-making, and there were quarrymen, traders, and many others. However, professionals are numbered at only 14.

Penkridge owed much to its transport links, which steadily improved. The main Stafford–Wolverhampton route, now the A449 road was turnpiked under the Stafford, Worcester and Warwick Roads Act 1760 (1 Geo. 3. c. 39). Bull Bridge, carrying the road over the Penk, was rebuilt in 1796 and widened in 1822. The improved road attracted more traffic: by 1818 there were stops by coaches on the London – Manchester, Birmingham – Manchester and Birmingham – Liverpool routes. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, opened in 1772, running straight through the parish and the township from north to south, with wharves at Spread Eagle (later called Gailey) and at Penkridge. In 1837, the Grand Junction Railway was opened. It cut through Penkridge on its west side, where Penkridge station was built, and was carried over the River Penk by the large Penkridge Viaduct. It began with two trains daily in each direction, to Stafford and Wolverhampton.

Heavy industry expanded in the 18th century, when a forge at Congreve was turning out 120 tons of iron a year, and in the 1820s the mill below Bull Bridge was used for rolling iron. However, this industry tailed off as the Black Country ironworks outstripped it. Extraction of building materials grew in Victorian times, with the Littletons operating quarries at Wolgarston, Wood Bank, and Quarry Heath, as well as a sand pit at Hungry Hill, Teddesley, and a brickyard in Penkridge.

====Zenith of the Littletons====
The fortunes of the village and the Littletons remained intertwined. Sir Edward Littleton, the fourth baronet, bought Penkridge manor from the Earl of Warwick in 1749, completing his family&#x27;s dominance of the area. Soon after he built Teddesley Hall, a much more impressive seat for the family. He survived until 1812, although, his wife died childless in 1781. He adopted his great-nephew, Edward Walhouse, as his heir. Walhouse took the name Littleton and took over the Littleton estates, although not the Littleton baronetcy. He achieved far greater eminence as a politician than any other member of the family, serving as Chief Secretary for Ireland under the Whig Prime Minister Grey in 1833–35. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hatherton, a title which remains with the head of the Littleton family to the present, and became an active member of the House of Lords.

Hatherton resided at Teddesley, where he established a free agricultural college and farmed successfully. He strongly promoted education in the area, paying for a National School in Penkridge and another at Levedale, and for clothing for some of the school children. However, his lifetime saw a decisive shift in the family&#x27;s interests. As heir to both the Walhouse family fortune and the Littleton estates, he owned great estates around Penkridge and mineral holdings and much residential property in the Cannock and Walsall areas. He owned coal mines at Great Wyrley, Bloxwich and Walsall; limestone quarries and brickyards in Walsall that were used to build much of the town; hundreds of residential and commercial properties; gravel and sand pits, stone quarries in many places. Unlike Penkridge, Cannock and Walsall were boom towns of the Victorian era, powered by the most modern and profitable industries of the age. The Littletons played a leading part in this phase of the Industrial Revolution and made large profits from it, and this tilted their attention increasingly away from their landed estates.

== The modern village ==
Penkridge in the 20th and 21st centuries has remained a thriving market village while evolving into a residential centre, but its ties to the land were weakened and those to the landed gentry broken. Residential development began even in Victorian times, with the middle-class villas of the St. Michael&#x27;s Road area, close to the railway. The main Stafford-Wolverhampton road was greatly improved between the wars, reshaping both Penkridge and Gailey.

The war itself prepared the way for changes. Teddesley Hall, no longer the Littleton&#x27;s family home since 1930, was used to house troops and prisoners of war. The old common lands between the Penk and the Cannock Road were used as a military camp during the war years. This eased their subsequent development as a large housing estate, greatly enlarging the size and population of Penkridge in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1951 and 1961 the population grew from 2,518 to 3,383 – a rise of over 34% in just ten years.

In 1919, the 3rd Lord Hatherton had begun disinvestment in land, often selling farms to their tenants. Over went in the Penkridge area, including land in the Deanery Manor, Congreve, Lower Drayton, Upper Drayton, Gailey, Levedale and Longridge. In 1953 the 4th Lord Hatherton sold off nearly , including Teddesley Hall, which was demolished within a year.

The M6 motorway came around Stafford in 1962 and connected with the M1 motorway in 1971.

The only large stores are the Co-operative supermarket. Independent shops, cafés, inns and services occupy the area between the old market place to the east and Stone Cross on the A449 to the west. The area between Pinfold Lane and the river, long the site of livestock sales, has emerged as a new market place, attracting large numbers of visitors to Penkridge on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

==Facilities==

Penkridge&#x27;s local market has been revived and is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, hosting up to 100 stalls. There is also an antiques market every Thursday. The substantial tower of the Grade I listed Church of St. Michael and All Angels on the western edge of the village, parts of which date back to the early thirteenth century, is visible even to passing road and rail travellers. A smaller Methodist church is on the largest road (the A449) route through the village, and there are three short streets of buildings dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, from the railway station eastward. Penkridge has its own historical stocks and cells remain in the village centre.

The village has several pubs, and there are also numerous sports clubs in Penkridge including cricket, football, rugby union and tennis clubs.

On the last Friday in November, for one night, the village centre used to close to traffic to allow a Victorian Night and Christmas Market to take place, in 2010 this event moved to the Market site where it has expanded to include over 70 stalls and a funfair.

<text>The 10th [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics]] under the auspices of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) were held in the Budapest Arena, Hungary between March 5 and March 7, 2004. A total off 139 countries were represented by 677 athletes at the championships.

It was the second visit of the championships to Budapest having previously visited there 15 years earlier in 1989. The newly built 13,000 capacity arena was built on the site of a former stadium that was destroyed by fire in 1999.

This was the last World Indoor Championships where the 200 m event was contested. The event was discontinued as the tight bends involved in running indoors left athletes drawn to run on the inside lanes with minimal or no chance of winning.

<text>Two Brothers is a 2004 adventure drama film directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Starring Guy Pearce and Freddie Highmore, it tells the story about two Indochinese tiger brothers named Kumal and Sangha, who are separated from their parents as cubs and then reunited a year later as adults to find their way back home. It was distributed by Pathé in Europe.

==Plot==
Set in 1920s French colonial Cambodia, the story follows two Indochinese tiger brothers, Sangha and Kumal, born to a protective tigress and a male tiger killed by adventurer Aidan McRory. Separated as cubs, their paths diverge: Kumal is captured by villagers, sold to a cruel circus run by Zerbino and Saladin, and trained through abuse to perform dangerous stunts. Sangha, meanwhile, is briefly adopted by Raoul, the son of French administrator Eugene Normandin, but is later sent to a palace menagerie after a conflict with the family’s dog.

McRory, a morally ambiguous hunter, becomes entangled in their fates. After failing to appease a vain Khmer prince with a counterfeit tiger skin (from the circus’s elderly tiger Caesar), he later discovers Sangha’s identity as the prince’s captive “ferocious” tiger. When the prince organizes a staged battle between Sangha and Kumal, the brothers initially clash but recognize each other mid-fight, reverting to playful cubhood antics. Chaos ensues as their trainers provoke them, leading to a violent escape.

The reunited tigers flee into the wilderness, causing mischief in nearby villages. McRory and Raoul track them, but Raoul persuades Sangha to return to the jungle to avoid human threats. Kumal, recalling McRory’s past kindness, spares him before both tigers retreat to their ancestral temple. There, they reunite with their mother, identifiable by a gunshot wound in her ear from McRory’s earlier hunt. The trio finds peace in the wild, symbolizing resilience against colonial exploitation and captivity.

<text>The is a Kyoto City Subway line which runs from the southeastern area of the city (starting from Rokujizo Station), then east to west (i.e. &quot;tōzai&quot; in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area. The Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operates the system along with the Karasuma Line and the City Bus. The present terminal stations are Rokujizo Station in Uji and Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto. It handles an average of 241,133 passengers daily (2009 data).

The stations are wheelchair-friendly, with elevators, narrow gaps between platform and train, and no height differences at places like restrooms. Each station has a colour code for easy recognition. All platforms on the line are island platforms, and have platform screen doors separating the platform from the tracks.

The line is long with a track gauge of . The entire length is double-track. Trains are electric, operating on 1,500 V DC. Trains travel between Rokujizō and Uzumasa Tenjingawa in 34 minutes.

On October 12, 1997, the section the line from Daigo to Nijō opened. On November 26, 2004, the line from Daigo to Rokujizō opened. An extension westward from Nijō to Uzumasa Tenjingawa began service on January 16, 2008.

Kyoto City Subway trains are based at Daigo Depot, while Keihan Electric Railway trains are based at Nishigōri Depot located on the Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto Line.

==History==

===Events leading up to construction===
After World War II, the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau discussed the possibility of creating a new municipal streetcar system, connecting Rokujizō, Daigo, and Keage, before cutting along the centre of Oike-dōri (an elevated line was also considered). Before long, the proposal was at an impasse in the face of ever-increasing automobile use in the city. However, the plan was eventually reworked as a subway line.

The population along the east-west route showed a considerable trend of growth, but road development in the vicinity could not overcome traffic congestion, so a plan for transportation facilities connecting the eastern part of the city (Yamashina-ku and the eastern portion of Fushimi-ku) with the city center was developed starting in 1965, and it was officially approved by the city government in 1969. The construction of the segment from Daigo to Nijō was set to start in 1975.

At that time, however, the Keihan Keishin Line ran above-ground between Misasagi and Sanjo Keihan along the planned route, and the issue of competition arose. As a result of negotiations, Kyoto City and Keihan Electric Railway agreed to establish a Third Sector (public-private partnership) company to obtain a Type-3 railroad business permit and control the tracks, while the City of Kyoto would obtain a Type-2 railroad business permit and operate the trains on that section. Thus the Kyoto Rapid Railway Corporation was born. Founded in 1986, then-mayor Masahiko Imagawa assumed duties as its president. Kyoto Rapid Railway constructed the subway through the Japan Railway Construction Group, and along with the Keihan Keishin Line&#x27;s incorporation, the above-ground section was set to be eliminated.

Over the course of construction work underneath Kyoto, the project faced frequent, unavoidable interruptions due to discoveries of remains and ruins, and experienced difficult work in tunneling underneath the Kamo River and Tōkaidō Shinkansen. The section from Daigo to Nijō opened in 1997, and the Keihan Keishin Line was integrated from Misasagi to Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae.

The reason that the Keishin Line does not terminate at Sanjo Keihan as it originally did when above-ground, is that the necessary amount of space for a returning track could not be provided (not only is there a sharp curve directly to the west of that station, but the extra dead-end track would be directly underneath the Kamo River, so it was not feasible). The reason it did not originally continue to the (then-)terminus at Nijō was for the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau to keep the calculated costs of running the trains balanced. However, since the opening of the extension in 2008, this is no longer the case and trains of the Keishin line now continue to the present terminus at Uzumasa Tenjingawa.

When the above-ground Keishin Line portion was demolished, Kujōyama Station and Hinooka Station (which have no subway counterparts) were demolished as well. City residents who lived near Kujōyama Station demanded that there be a Kujōyama subway station, but due to anticipated difficulties in construction (local topography would have either made a station on the subway line as it stands extremely deep or required steep grades on either side), as well as an insufficient estimated number of riders, this request went unfulfilled.

===Extension west===
A plan exists to extend the Tōzai Line as far west as Rakusai in Nishikyō-ku, but for the time being, the extension will be stopped at Uzumasa Tenjingawa; prospects beyond that are as-yet still unclear. There are several issues to be considered:
*The population of Rakusai New Town is holding steady or decreasing;
*Rakusaiguchi Station on the Hankyū Kyoto Main Line and Katsuragawa Station on the JR Kyoto Line are already in service, so the inconvenience of transportation in that area has already been resolved to a degree;
*The subway&#x27;s high construction costs;
*and the population of the Umezu and Kamikatsura districts leading into Rakusai New Town along the route are not very large.

===Timeline===
*October 12, 1997: Opening of the section from Daigo to Nijō. The Keihan Keishin Line is incorporated into the subway.
*November 26, 2004: Opening of the section from Rokujizō to Daigo.
*January 16, 2008: Opening of the section from Nijō to Uzumasa Tenjingawa.

==Sights of note along the line==
* Daigo Station: Daigo-ji, a Buddhist temple with a pagoda and Japanese garden; connections to Toyotomi Hideyoshi
* Kyōto Shiyakusho-mae Station: Kyoto City Hall; nearby, the rebuilt Honnō-ji, the original of which (in another part of the city) burned in the attack by Akechi Mitsuhide against Oda Nobunaga
* Nijō-jō-mae Station: The Nijo Castle of Tokugawa Ieyasu

<text>The adventure film is a broad genre of film. Some early genre studies found it no different than the Western film or argued that adventure could encompass all Hollywood genres. Commonality was found among historians Brian Taves and Ian Cameron in that the genre required a setting that was both remote in time and space to the film audience and that it contained a positive hero who tries to make right in their world. Some critics such as Taves limit the genre to naturalistic settings, while Yvonne Tasker found that would limit films such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) from the genre. Tasker found that most films in the genre featured narratives located within a fantasy world of exoticized setting, which are often driven by quests for characters seeking mythical objects or treasure hunting. The genre is closely associated with the action film, and is sometimes used interchangeably or in tandem with that genre.

Adventure films boast their setting and visuals as key elements. This ranged from early technical showcases such as &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925) and &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). These films set up exotic locations as both beautiful and dangerous. This would be a continuing trend for Hollywood adventure films. The other major Hollywood style was the historical adventure typified by early films in the style of &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920) which feature less intense violence. Historical adventure was a popular Hollywood staple until the mid-1950s. While the historical adventure film would be parodied or presented as highly camp, special effects-driven adventure films began to dominate the market towards the late 1970s, with films such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). This trend continued into the 21st century.

==Characteristics==
Adventure is a broad film genre. Early writing on the genre had wide categorizations. Critic André Bazin went as far to say in the 1950s that &quot;there is not difference between Hopalong Cassidy and Tarzan except for their costumes and the arena in which they demonstrate their prowess.&quot; Ian Cameron in &quot;Adventure in the Movies&quot; (1973) stated that adventure &quot;is not confined to a particular genre [...] it is a quality which turns up in almost every sort of story film; indeed the most obvious adventures movies, the sword-and-bosom epics, are usually among the least interesting.&quot; American historian Brian Taves wrote in 1993 that having such wide-ranging application of the genre would render it meaningless.

Despite their different definitions, both Taves and Cameron stated that genre required a setting that was both remote in time and space to its audience. While Cameron refuted the idea of a clearly defined adventure genre, he said films described the &quot;positive feeling for adventure&quot; evoked from the scenes of action in the film and the identification with the main character. Taves echoed this, exemplifying the character of Robin Hood who deals with a valiant fight for just government in an exotic past.

Taves wrote in &quot;The Romance of Adventure: The Genre of Historical Adventure Movies&quot; (1993) that defining the genre in context with the historical adventure, and said explicitly excluding films with fantasy settings such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) as they involved the supernatural over human agency. Taves wrote that &quot;unlike adventure, fantasy presents a netherworld where events violate physical reality and the bounds of human possibility.&quot; Comparatively, in his overview of British adventure cinema, James Chapman said the adventure film was defined from a fictional narrative and excluded films based on historical events and people such as &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), finding they belonged to other types of narratives such as the historical film and the war film. Chapman summarized the complicated nature of the genre, stating that the &quot;Adventure film is a less clearly defined than most: indeed, this might be one reason why film historians have left it pretty much alone.&quot; He described the style as not being a discrete genre in its own, but a flexible, overarching category that encompasses a range of different related narrative forms. 

British author and academic Yvonne Tasker wrote in her 2015 book &quot;The Hollywood Action and Adventure Film&quot; (2015) that adventure films imply a story that is located within a fantasy of exoticized setting. She found that these films often apply a quest narrative, where characters seek mythical objects or fabulous treasure as seen in films like &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950) or &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). Tasker opted for a broader sense of genre, and commented on Taves limits, stating it was an understandable impulse to place generic limits on potentially diverse bodies of texts, while included films like &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; which she described as feeling &quot;like an adventure in the broadest sense of the term.&quot; Tasker noted this specifically, that even when disregarding its historical setting, the film concerned a quest, with travel and developing moral sense of the hero&#x27;s place in the world.

Tasker wrote that these films films have no consistent iconography, their set design and special effects, ranging from stop-motion, to digital imagery and 3D are given a privileged place in these genres. Chapman also noted the style as being commonly applied to narratives where action and visual spectacle were foregrounded. He included styles like the swashbuckler, the British empire film, the sensationalized spy thriller, and mythological fantasy films as part of adventure cinema genre. 

Writing about the adventure genre in the 1970s, Jeffrey Richards said that &quot;since the way a swashbuckler moves and looks is just as important as what it says, we must look at the art director, costume designer, fencing master, stunt arranger, cinematographer and actor just much as the writer and director. For the swashbuckler is truly the sum of all their work.&quot;

Both action and adventure are often used together as film genres, and are even used interchangeably. For Taves, he compared the styles saying that adventure films were &quot;something beyond action&quot; and were elevated &quot;beyond the physical challenge&quot; and by &quot;its moral and intellectual flavour.&quot;

==History==

Forms of filmmaking that would become film genres were mostly defined in other media before Thomas Edison devised the Kinetograph in the late 1890s. Genres, such as adventure fiction were developed as written fiction.
In the early Hollywood cinema, early adventure cinema were both original stories as well as adaptations of popular media such as adventure stories, magazines, and folk tales. Films were adapted from adventure stories such as &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885), &quot;&quot; (1887), and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883).

Tasker described both action and adventure cinema are resistant to any historical evolutionary chronology. Both genres are self-reflexive and draw from conventions of other genres ranging from horror to historical imperial adventure. Taves found that films that were swashbucklers or pirate-themed adventures were often humorous, and that they retained viability even when parodied.

Many silent films with action and adventure scenarios flourished in the silent films of the 1910s and 1920s. These films required elaborate visual effects that were important to displaying menacing or fantastic worlds. These films often took narratives from novels, such as films like &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925). Beyond being adaptations of famous books, Tasker said that the appeal of these films was also in their effects laden scene, finding &quot;The Lost World&quot; a &quot;landmark of effects-led adventure cinema.&quot; Outside technical effects, adventure films of Douglas Fairbanks such as &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1922) with its scenes of battles and recreations of castles cost a record-setting $1.5 million to produce also provided a variant of adventure spectacle to audiences.

Tasker stated that &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1925) arguably initiated a jungle adventure film cycle that would be expanded on in the similarly effects driven sound film &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). In her study of &quot;King Kong&quot;, Cynthia Erb noted a conventions of both travel documentary and jungle adventure traditions. Tasker wrote that the best known displays of these films were those that focused on the character of Tarzan which found more significantly commercial success with the success of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films featuring Johnny Weissmuller during the decade. Erb found that the jungle imagery of these films of the 1930s frequently showcased the jungle world as frequently alternating between &quot;demonic and edenic&quot; images, while Tasker said the jungle films and other adventure films of the period would establish a travelogue allure of these settings as romantic spaces.

Within the Classical Hollywood cinema, one of the major other styles was the historical adventure film. These films were typically set in the past and drew from the Fairbanks films such as &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1920). They feature violence in a less intense manner than other contemporary genres such as the Western or war film. While not specifically associated with one Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. released a series of popular historical adventures featuring Errol Flynn such as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935), &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). The historical adventure film continued to be a popular Hollywood genre into the mid-1950s featuring various male stars such as Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Burt Lancaster, and Stewart Granger.

Imperialism-themed adventure films continued in the 1950s with a greater emphasis on location shooting. Examples include the box office hit &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950) which was shot in Africa. 1960s fantasy films such as &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) combined the set-pieces and fantastic locations of historical adventures with renewed emphasis on special effects. By the 1970s, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) marked a point where the historical adventure has been firmly associated with what Tasker described as &quot;comic - even camp - tone&quot; that would inform later films such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (2003). Few other films embarked on more serious tones, such as Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005).

Since the late 1970s, both action and adventure films have become synonymous with the high-budgeted and profitable Hollywood films and franchises. While both genres took on challenging material, towards the late 1970s of an adventure style geared towards more family-oriented audiences with films like &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981). &quot;Star Wars&quot; exemplifies a resurgent adventure strand of the 1970s cinema with characters like the Jedi Knights who swing from ropes and wield light sabers recall sword-fighting and swashbuckling films. Tasker commented that this led to a commercially lucrative and culturally conservative version of the genre that would continue into the 21st century with film series like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. In their analysis of the genre in 2018, Johan Höglund and Agnieszka Soltysik Monnet found that the contemporary adventure form often appears in trans-genre work where the adventure component is perceived as secondary. They exemplified that in films such ranging from &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), &quot;Godzilla&quot; (2014), to &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; (2013), which range from fantasy film to science fiction film to war film genres, all adhere to traditional adventure narratives.

==Critical reception==
Adventure films are generally perceived with a low critical status, with a few exceptions. Historically, the genre has not been seen as authored cinema. The genre&#x27;s cinematic traditions were effectively absent from debates on genre cinema since the 1960s. 

Chapman echoed this statement. He argued that with only a handful of exceptions, adventure films have not won much favour with film critics: &quot;In traditional film criticism there are few &#x27;good&#x27; adventure films; those that have won critical acclaim have usually done so on grounds other than their status as genre films.&quot; When action and adventure cinema secure awards, it is often in categories such as visual effects and sound editing. Tasker found this reflected Richards comments on the creative labor as being the primary appeal on work in the genre.

<text>Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is the leading exploration and production company in the Sultanate of Oman. The Company delivers the majority of the country&#x27;s crude oil production and natural gas supply. The company is owned by the Government of Oman (with a 60% interest), Royal Dutch Shell (34%), TotalEnergies (4%) and Partex (2%). The first economic oil find was made in 1962, and the first oil consignment was exported in 1967.

==History==
A geological survey of the country in 1925 by the D&#x27;Arcy Exploration Company found no conclusive evidence of oil. Twelve years later, when American geologists began intensively searching for oil in neighboring Saudi Arabia, Sultan Said bin Taimur granted a 75-year concession for central Oman to the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), and a separate concession for the province of Dhofar. Pausing only for the Second World War, exploration for oil was under way in Oman.

IPC created an associate company, Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd, to operate the concession. The company had the same five shareholders as IPC, four of which had an interest of 23.75%: the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (which would eventually become the British Petroleum Company, or BP), Compagnie Française des Pétroles (a predecessor of today&#x27;s Total) and the Near East Development Company (whose shareholders were Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum, today&#x27;s ExxonMobil), and the remaining 5% stake being held by the fifth shareholder, Partex, representing the interests of the oil magnate, Calouste Gulbenkian.

In 1951, the Dhofar concession was allowed to expire and the company dropped &#x27;Dhofar&#x27; from its title, becoming Petroleum Development (Oman) Ltd.

Having landed at Duqm in February 1954, IPC geologists were faced with tribal conflicts which made access to the most promising oil prospect, Jebel Fahud, difficult. They reached the jebel in October 1954 and began to survey the surrounding terrain. Supplies had to be transported from Duqm. In January 1956 the company started drilling its first well at Fahud but did not find any oil. Later, when the supply line was switched to the Sumail Gap, warring tribes were able to disrupt convoys and bring operations to a halt.

Further dry wells were drilled and this lack of success, combined with worsening logistical problems and a glut of oil on the world market, led most of the partners to withdraw from the venture in 1960. Only Shell and Partex opted to remain in Oman to continue the search for oil. The first successful findings, on an commercially relevant level, were made at Yibal in April 1962.

In 1963 the Natih field was discovered, followed closely by success at Fahud, only a few hundred metres from the original IPC well. Investment in a pipeline to the coast and all the other hardware necessary to transport and export Oman&#x27;s crude was made. A 276-kilometre pipeline requiring 60,000 tons of steel pipe was laid, the labour being provided by the inhabitants of whichever villages happened to be near the worksite.
The pipe laying was followed closely by the construction of an industrial complex at Saih al Maleh (later renamed Mina al Fahal), the building of a tank farm, the installation of single-buoy moorings for seagoing tankers and the erection of a 20-megawatt power plant. The whole development — including the pipeline, the coastal industrial area, the tank farm, the marine terminal, a chain of radio repeater stations and housing for staff at Ras al Hamra — cost $70 million.

The first export of Omani oil took place on 27 July 1967. The original debit note shows that the consignment consisted of of oil valued at $1.42 a barrel. A month before, in June, the Compagnie Française des Pétroles rejoined the partnership by taking over two-thirds of Partex&#x27;s equity share, resulting in the following shareholding in the company that by then had changed its name to Petroleum Development (Oman): Shell 85%, Compagnie Francaise des Petroles 10% and Partex 5%.

In 1969, the Dhofar concession was reacquired and was once again integrated into the companies operations.

On 23 July 1970 His Majesty Sultan Qaboos took over from his father as ruler of the country. He made his first visit to the PD(O) offices on 18 August 1970.

===Consolidation===
All through the 1970s, PD(O) strove to maintain its production and replace its reserves while developing its professionalism. Some significant discoveries early in the decade contributed to that objective: Ghaba North in 1972, followed by Saih Nihayda, Saih Rawl, Qarn Alam and Habur. All five fields were on stream by 1975, the crude oil being transported via a new pipeline to the main pipeline 75 kilometers east of Fahud. Thanks in part to these new sources of oil, production averaged (bpd) in 1972 and in 1976/76.

The first half of the 1970s was important for other reasons as well. On 1 January 1974 the Government of Oman acquired a 25% shareholding in the Petroleum Development (Oman); six months later the shareholding was increased to 60%, backdated to the beginning of the year. As a result, the foreign interest in PD(O) was now made up of the Shell (34%), Compagnie Française des Petroles (4%) and Partex (2%). These shareholdings have remained unchanged to the present day. The company, however, underwent a change six years later. On 15 May 1980, it was registered by Royal Decree as a limited liability company under the name Petroleum Development Oman — now without parentheses in its name. Its current nautilus logo was also introduced then.

===Maturity (1994–2002)===
By the end of 2000 PDO witnessed an increase in production. This was due to the increase in production arose from the application of the latest technology to increase oil recovery in existing fields. And some of the production increase over the years was made up of &quot;new oil&quot; from fields that were not only found but also developed at an ever-accelerating pace. During the period 1967–1980 all of PDO&#x27;s production came from 11 fields; by 1988, 50 fields provided the sum total of PDO&#x27;s oil output; by 1990 it was 60, and in 1999 it was nearly 100.

When PDO&#x27;s gas-exploration campaign in the early 1990s made it clear how bountiful the country&#x27;s gas fields were, the Government decided to establish a completely new industry: the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1996 PDO concluded an agreement with the Government to develop the central Oman gas fields in order to supply gas to an LNG plant in Qalhat, near Sur. To fulfill its end of the agreement, the company had to drill wells, hook them up to a new gas processing plant at Saih Rawl, and then transport the processed gas via a 352-kilometre pipeline to Qalhat. Furthermore, PDO would then be responsible for guaranteeing the delivery of gas for 25 years.

This upstream LNG project, costing $1.2 billion, is the single biggest project in PDO&#x27;s history. And it was executed as planned. The Saih Rawl Central Processing Plant and the gas pipeline from Saih Rawl to Qalhat were dedicated to the nation in November 1999, the first downstream cargo of LNG was shipped to Korea in April 2000, and His Majesty the Sultan officially opened the LNG plant six months later.

Having built up such momentum in its oil production as it entered the 1990s, the Company fully expected the trend to continue. Unfortunately, the company&#x27;s field-development strategy for the start of the 21st century – based on incremental infill drilling with horizontal wells and extensive waterflooding – had its momentum dissipated before the waterflooding projects, which require comprehensive reservoir studies, could be fully implemented. The natural production-rate decline of its major oil fields eventually caught up with the Company at the start of the millennium. In 1997, the 35-year old Yibal field began to decline in production. Two scientific papers published in 2003 showed a decline of about 12 percent annually since 1997, with 5 percent being the regional average.

===Sustainability (2002–present)===
Following a comprehensive review in 2002 that led to a sweeping change programme, PDO laid out production-recovery plans based not only on waterflooding but also on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques: the application of heat, chemicals or gas solvents to alter the way oil or injected water flows in a reservoir. In order for them to be sustainable in the long run, the plans had to be executed for substantially less money than originally envisaged, making them all the more challenging. A total of $2 billion in cost savings over the five-year period 2002–2008 were incorporated into the company&#x27;s budget. Because of the long-term nature of investments that would be required, the Omani Government agreed at the end of 2004 to extend PDO&#x27;s exploration and production concession and operating agreements for 40 years – until 2044.

Meanwhile, gas continues to be a growth area for the company. A new gas-processing plant was commissioned in Saih Nihayda in 2005, and another one is due in 2008 for PDO&#x27;s newest gas field in Kauther. With the addition of those two processing plants, nearly one-third of the hydrocarbon energy that PDO supplies will come from natural gas—the fuel that has a central role in the Government&#x27;s economic diversification plans.

Faced with oil prices above $100 a barrel and sinking field capacities, PDO was one of the many companies to introduce in-site combustion, an EOR technique involving lighting fires within the reservoirs, in 2008.

In 2010, the company announced the discovery of three new oil- and one gas field.

Since 2010, PDO has been working on the Miraah Solar Project, a 1,021 megawatt solar thermal facility, which is to be used in EOR from 2017/2018 onwards.

In 2011, a series of strikes and protests took place in Oman that also involved hundreds of PDO workers demanding higher wages.

Since the decline of natural production capacity, PDO has invested heavily to keep up and try to increase production again. Having to rely on marginal wells and enhanced oil recovery techniques more and more, the overall quality of oil is &quot;getting heavier and drifting down&quot; said the director of energy consulting firm Purvin &amp; Gertz in 2011.

In 2013, a team of members from Manpower Ministry and Oman&#x27;s Trade Union Federation found nearly 50 labor law violations and mistakes in safety norms during an inspection at PDO&#x27;s Fahud facilities.

In 2014, P. Mohamed Ali, the former managing director of Galfar Engineering and Contracting, was sentenced to three years in jail for bribes made to PDO. In the same year Juma Al Hinai, the former head of the tender committee at PDO, was also charged with bribery and sentenced to three years in jail, including a fine of 600,000 rials. He was banned from public office for 20 years. Subsequently, the head of PDO warned all contractors to adhere to anti-bribery and -corruption policies.

In 2016, PDO launched a $3.4 billion loan program with HSBC bank. In the same year, PDO signed a contract with GE Oil &amp; Gas to provide Progressive cavity pump (PCP) equipment and related services from late 2016 onwards.

In 2017, following many years of reconstruction and oilfield optimization, PDO confirmed a new combined oil, gas and condensate production record (1.293 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, BOE) for 2016. The company is still faced with a low price environment and continues to work on cost controlling measures. The company in 2017 also celebrated 50 years of oil exports and announced a continually growing expansion into hydrocarbon and renewable energy generation and water management – turning PDO into a fully diversified energy company. Around 80% of operations are estimated to remain in the oil and gas sector until 2027.

The largest onshore discovery in 2018 was a natural-gas condensate area, found on the Mabrouk North East field, operated by PDO.

==Corporate structure==
===Board of directors===
The Board consists of twelve members and includes the chairman, who is the Minister of Oil &amp; Gas His Excellency Dr. Mohammed bin Hamad bin Saif al Rumhy]], who represents the Government of Oman and representation from PDO&#x27;s private shareholders, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Partex.

=== Managing Director&#x27;s Committee ===
The Managing Director&#x27;s Committee (MDC) shares responsibility for the company&#x27;s overall performance and business direction. The committee is headed by the managing director who is assisted by fifteen other Directors, who are responsible for setting the technical standards, the allocation of staff and their development.

==Operations==
PDO operates in a concession area of about 90,000 km2 (one third of Oman&#x27;s geographical area), has around 130 producing oil fields, 14 producing gas fields, around 8,000 active wells, a diverse workforce of more than 8,500 employees of 64 nationalities, and more than 45,000 contractors.

The primary objective of PDO is to engage efficiently, responsibly and safely in the exploration, production, development, storage and transportation of hydrocarbons in the Sultanate.

===Oil exploration and production===
PDO finds oil fields and develops them into productive assets by drilling wells and constructing and operating various hydrocarbon treatment and transport facilities. The crude oil that is produced from the fields is not sold by the company but rather delivered to a storage facility at Mina al Fahal, where it is loaded onto seagoing tankers at the discretion of the company&#x27;s shareholders. As such, the Company does not earn any money from the sale of oil; its shareholders do. The shareholders in turn cover all budgeted operating and capital expenditure.

===Gas exploration and production===
PDO also finds, develops and operates natural gas fields and their associated production systems all on behalf of the Government of Oman. The Company delivers gas to the Government Gas System, which supplies fuel for most of Oman&#x27;s power stations and some of its industries, and to the Oman LNG plant at Qalhat, near Sur. As part of its gas production operations, PDO also supplies some of condensate liquid hydrocarbons that condense out of natural gas and about 200 tonnes per day of liquefied petroleum gas, which is mainly used for cooking.

===Solar===
Since 2010, PDO has been working together with partnering GlassPoint to create the Miraah Solar Project, a 1,021 megawatt solar thermal facility which has been under construction in Southern Oman since 2015. The facility produces steam, which will be used for thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR), extracting heavy oils from the Amal oilfield. The plant is one of the largest solar plants in the world and will generate around 6,000 tons of solar steam every day, and by replacing the current EOR system which relies on the burning of natural gas, it will reduce  emissions by over 300,000 tons annually.

===Education and training===
In addition, PDO plays a key role in educating and developing young Omani talent through its comprehensive education and training programmes. It also supports and encourages local businesses and communities through its Business Development Centre. PDO believes that the sustainable development of the country is furthered through its education and training initiatives and through its efforts to stimulate successful Omani businesses throughout the country. The PDO established the Oman Oil and Gas Exhibition Centre in Muscat in 1995 to educate those in fossil fuel development in the country.

==Awards==
PDO has been awarded more than 50 different honors since 2011.

Since 2011, PDO has received various awards for the Nimr Reed Beds water treatment plant, including The Global Water Award, presented to BAUER water by Kofi Annan in 2011, the Shell Award for the Best Innovative Project. In 2012 PDO won the Oman Green Innovation Award, the ADIPEC Best MENA Oil and Gas HSE Award and an award for Excellence in Environmental Project and Products by the Regional Clean Sea Organisation (RECSO) that same year. In 2013, PDO won almost 20 awards, including different awards for their Amal Solar project, the Oman Green Innovation Awards for the Ras Al Hamra International School. In 2015, PDO won four different Shell Impact International Impact Awards. Amongst the awards in 2016, the company was awarded the APIPEC award for Best Oil and Gas Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Project, and the Best Practice Award for early monetization of new discoveries through Early Development Facilities.

==Miscellaneous==
PDO has a Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) team of 20 employees that work to create an environment free from any form of harassment and discrimination.

In 2017, PDO donated six fire trucks to the International College of Engineering &amp; Management (ICEM) and announced to support 18 new initiatives in Oman, focusing on health and safety, community infrastructure, employability training, charities, and animal welfare.

<doc id="871096" wikidata="Q4726452" url="?curid=871096" title="Alien Nation (novel series)">
<text>Alien Nation was a science fiction novel series, based on the movie and television series of the same name. It began in March 1993 with Pocket Books publishing the series. Various books of the series were written by L. A. Graf, Peter David, K. W. Jeter, Barry B. Longyear, David Spencer, Garfield Reeves-Stevens and Judith Reeves-Stevens. All of the books follow the adventures of the Human Detective Matthew Sikes, and his Tenctonese partner George Francisco. Like the TV series, most of the books have two parallel storylines that converge at the end, and most of the novels take modern day issues and put a slightly alien twist on them.

==Alien Nation: A Novelization==
This book was written by Alan Dean Foster, and was released in 1989. It is an adaptation of the movie.

==Alien Nation #1: Day of Descent==
This book was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and was released in 1993. It is a prequel to both the movie and television series, in the months leading up to the arrival of the Tenctonese on Earth. Matthew Sikes, a rookie detective, is on his first murder investigation when he stumbles onto a deadly conspiracy that threatens his whole world. Light-years away, a Tenctonese slave named Stangya Soren&#x27;tzahh (later to be known as George Francisco) is swept up into his people&#x27;s fight for freedom against their ruthless masters, the Overseers. The slave ship crash lands on Earth, where Matt and George unknowingly work together to prevent a disaster that could destroy both their species.

==Alien Nation #2: Dark Horizon==
This book was written by K. W. Jeter, and was released in 1993. It was released prior to the production of the television movie of the same name. It was written to tie up some of the loose ends of the Alien Nation series at a time when it looked like it was never going to return to television. It recaps the events of &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, the last episode of the series, and used the un-produced script from &quot;Dark Horizon&quot;, the first episode of what would have been the second season.

The Tenctonese are faced with a deadly new bacteria created by a Purist group determined to rid the Earth of all Newcomers. George Francisco&#x27;s wife &amp; eldest daughter are infected with the bacteria, and as they lay close to death, a threat to the whole world appears. Someone has come from space to force the Tenctonese back into slavery, and they plan on taking all of humanity too.

==Alien Nation #3: Body and Soul==
This book was written by Peter David, and was released in 1993. It was a novelization of the then-unproduced script for what would become the second two-hour television movie of the same name. As with &quot;Dark Horizon&quot;, the later film was somewhat different from the novel. Matt and George investigate the rumor of the birth of a half-human, half-Tenctonese child. Meanwhile, Sikes&#x27; relationship with Tenctonese woman Cathy Frankel starts to get serious.

==Alien Nation #4: The Change==
This book was written by Barry B. Longyear, and was released in 1994. It was based on an unproduced script for what would have been the second television season. George Francisco undergoes a metamorphosis that could mean the beginning of a new life - or his death. George must also face a vicious killer who has sworn revenge on him and his loved ones.

==Alien Nation #5: Slag Like Me==
This book was written by Barry B. Longyear, and was released in 1994. The plot concerns a journalist named Micky Cass who goes undercover as a Newcomer to expose the racism and discrimination suffered by the Tenctonese. Now Cass is missing, and Matthew Sikes must also disguise himself as a Newcomer to find him. This places Matt in the path of the worst violence the city has ever seen - and forces him to confront a hidden truth inside himself.

&quot;Alien Nation: Slag Like Me&quot; is an allusion to the book &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, a 1961 non-fiction book by Caucasian journalist John Howard Griffin, who travelled throughout the racially segregated states of the American South passing as a black man.

==Alien Nation #6: Passing Fancy==
This book was written by David Spencer, and was released in 1994. The plot follows Matt who meets a mysterious woman from his past and is thrown into an investigation of a lethal Newcomer drug. He must then ask the woman he loves to risk her life for someone she&#x27;s never even met. The case causes tension to mount between Matt and George as they discover that some Newcomers will do anything to assimilate into human society - even if it means their destruction.

The book &quot;Black Like Me&quot; is again mentioned here and is read by Sikes in order to understand.

==Alien Nation #7: Extreme Prejudice==
This book was written by L.A. Graf, and was released in 1995. It sees Matt, the Franciscos&#x27; and Cathy attending a conference in Pittsburgh when a series of murders has them suspecting a Tenctonese creature is on the loose.

In a tongue-in-cheek joke by the author, a Tenctonese husband-and-wife writing team use the pen name &quot;L.A. Graf&quot; for the author of a series of science fiction novels.

==Alien Nation #8: Cross of Blood==
This book was written by K.W. Jeter, and was released in 1995. The most radical of all of the books, &quot;Cross of Blood&quot; explores the possibility of Tenctonese female Cathy Frankel getting pregnant with human Matt Sikes&#x27; child. The resulting political tension and racial riots threaten to tear Los Angeles apart.

This book recalls characters and events from &quot;Dark Horizon&quot;.

<doc id="871105" wikidata="Q3146263" url="?curid=871105" title="Melsen">
<text>Melsen is a village in the province of East Flanders, Belgium, and is a part of the municipality of Merelbeke. It covers an area of roughly 3 square kilometers. Its terrain is largely made up of one great hill. The northern and southern slopes of the hill, which are fairly steep for the surrounding area (about 20 meters), form the natural boundaries with the bordering villages of Vurste and Schelderode. The eastern slopes of the hill evolve into agricultural land and farther east into the forest of Makkegem. The western slope descends into a marsh that is connected to the Schelde (Scheldt) river.

Most of the land used to be for agricultural purposes, or covered with forests and marshes, but now most of the western and northern part of the village is almost fully covered by a network of streets and houses. Only some fields on the borders of the village remain.

==History==
From the documents of the medieval abbey of Ename, it can be concluded that Melsen was in existence in the 9th century AD, and probably before that time as well. Its name, which roots back to proto-Germanic and could either mean &#x27;pig stable&#x27; or &#x27;marsh&#x27;, seems to hint at an earlier origin, although there is no evidence to support this. There have also been archeological findings that have shown human presence in the area of the village dating back to Prehistory, but these were not permanent settlements.

Despite its long history, documents from the Middle Ages suggest that it has always been a small village without an important role. During the civil war that raged in the Low Countries in the 16th century, one of the feudal lords of Melsen, Filips III van der Gracht, was decapitated in Ghent along with others for his rebellion against the Spanish occupiers. His tombstone, although heavily eroded, can still be seen at the church of Melsen.

Incidentally, this church is probably one of the oldest buildings in the village, its foundations dating back to the 9th or 10th century, although most of its present-day form was built in the 17th century and rebuilt after World War II destroyed part of its walls and glass windows. Locally it is known for its long, slender and sharp bell tower. Although Melsen was ruled by aristocrats until 1977, not many of them have been buried at its cemetery. The &#x27;castle&#x27; of Melsen is another old building in the village, dating back from the 16th or 17th century. Other houses or buildings in the village also date back 300 years or more.

Another famous building in the village is the &#x27;Stone Mill&#x27;. In 1940, the retreating Belgian army put the mill on fire to prevent it from being used as a watchtower by the German occupiers, because geographically, the &#x27;Stone Mill&#x27; was the highest architectural point in a circle of about 10 kilometers. The mill was never rebuilt and is still an impressive ruin, with only the bricks left (hence its current name). Although successive generations since World War II have claimed it could collapse at any time, it still hasn&#x27;t happened. It is currently a big nesting place for birds.

In 1977, Melsen merged with Schelderode, Bottelare, Lemberge, Munte and Merelbeke to form the municipality of greater Merelbeke, although most original plans had provided for Melsen to become the centerpiece of this new town. Its old town hall is currently a bank office. In the mid and late nineties the village saw an explosive growth due to the influx of newcomers, making its population nowadays almost 2000 people.

==Language and dialect==
The local dialect belongs to the group of central East-Flemish dialects but, like almost all dialects in this area, is strongly recessive because of its low prestige, greater mobility of people and the pervasive influence of both surrounding dialects, Standard Dutch and the so-called &#x27;Verkavelingsvlaams&#x27;, a mixture of Standard Dutch and Flemish sounds and words. The future of the dialect is uncertain.

The current form of the dialect contains over 16 vowels and 5 diphthongs and differs especially in this respect from Standard Dutch. Its consonant system is more like Standard Dutch, although some phonemes are missing entirely. Its vocabulary and grammar seem to be both a simplified and archaic version of many typical Dutch and Germanic root-words, with many French words intermixed. To German ears, it has been described as sounding a bit like Swedish, while speakers of English have sometimes interpreted it as a very deviant form of Scots. The dialect will usually be understood by most Flemings, except those in Limburg.

<text>Russian Public Opinion Research Center (RPORC) () is a state-owned polling institution established in 1987, known as the All-Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion until 1992.

VCIOM is the oldest polling institution in post-Soviet Russia and one of Russia&#x27;s leading sociological and market research companies. It was established in 1987 under the decree issued by VCSPS (All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions) and USSR State Committee of Labor as the All-Union Public Opinion Research Center (and in 1992 renamed the Russian Public Opinion Research Center). In 2003 VCIOM became an &#x27;open joint-stock company with full state ownership&#x27;. VCIOM conducts &quot;full cycle&quot; marketing, social and political research, from instrument design and data collection to analysis and presentation of findings to its clients.

VCIOM branch offices operate in all seven of Russia&#x27;s federal districts. Besides its own branches, Center has partnership agreements with a significant number of local regional research firms. VTsIOM has its own interviewers’ network, which consists of about 5,000 people.

==Science and teaching==
VTsIOM holds the status of scientific institution. Besides that, there is a scientific Expert Council functioning in the Center, which consists of Russian sociologists, political scientists, marketologists, philosophers, and historians. VTsIOM holds competitions of scientific works among young researchers.

Since 2003, it has published its own journal, called &quot;Monitoring of Public Opinion: Economic and Social Changes&quot;, which is issued six times a year. Since 2009 it has been available via open Internet access (both its Archive and recent issues). The Editorial Boarl includes leading Russian sociologists (Russian Academy of Science staff, Moscow State University, Russian State Social University, Higher School of Economics, Institute for Market Research GFK-Rus staff and others). There is VTsIOM Department Chair in the Higher School of Economics that has been operating since 2008, and VTsIOM Research Center in the Russian State Social University operating since 2008.

The Center designs and publishes monographs and edited volumes of sociological research devoted to the state of the public opinion in Russia. The recent monographs are: &quot;From Eltsin to Putin: three epochs in the historical consciousness of Russians&quot; (2007), &quot;Political Russia: pre-elections guide – 2007&quot;, &quot;Political Dictionary of The Present&quot; (2006), &quot;Russia on the Crossroads of the 2d Term&quot; (2005). For more details see: &quot;VCIOM Library: some of the recent books&quot; Public opinion research dating prior to 1992 are stored in an archive. The results of the public opinion polls &quot;Express&quot; since 1992 have been stored in “Archivist Database”.

VTsIOM is the member of international professional networks including InterSearch and the Eurasian Monitor. It is guided by the European Society for Opinion and Market Research ESOMAR standards and norms. There are more than 70 specialists employed in the company headquarters in Moscow (with expertise in sociology, marketing, political science, finance, psychology, and statistics), as well as dozens in its offices around the country. The head of the Center is Valery Fedorov.

==History==

===Foundation (1987)===
The Decree to launch VTsIOM (All-Union in those times) was adopted at the July meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1987. The founders were VCSPS (All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions) and USSR State Committee of Labour. The first director was Tatyana Zaslavskaya (academician). Zaslavskaya tells that the Institute of Demoscopy (Federal Republic of Germany) headed by Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was taken as a model when establishing the Center.

Grushin made many efforts in 1987-1988 to set up a network of sociological centers in the Republics of the USSR and regions of Russia. That made possible to conduct the first mass surveys on a representative samples among adults in November 1988; a year later these surveys became systematical.

In 1988 Yury Levada together with his students (Lev Gudkov, Boris Dubin, Alexey Levinson and others) went to work in VTsIOM (first as the head of the Theoretical Research Department and later – since 1992 as the head of the company). In an interview Yuri Levada talks about the first years of VTsIOM, refers to Tatyana Zaslavskaya (Татьяна Заславская) and Boris Grushin (Борис Грушин) as the founders of VTsIOM in 1987 and states that he was invited by them to join VTsIOM.

===Growth, 1989–2003===
VTsIOM became widely respected for its objectivity and professionalism among academics and journalists in both the Soviet Union and the West. In the 1990s, the agency&#x27;s polls gained a reputation for being very reliable. During this period VTsIOM had conducted over 1,000 polls.

Being the first sociological institution in the USSR (and Russia), VTsIOM served as the cradle for numerous marketing and sociological centers of the country.

In August 1989 Boris Grushin left VTsIOM to establish his own organization studying the public opinion &quot;Vox Populi - Glas Naroda&quot; (People’s Voice).

In 1992 the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM) that was originally established as a Division of the Center for raising charity funds, separated from VTsIOM. In 1999 VCIOM achieved scientific institute status.

===Conflict (2003)===
Although VTsIOM received no budget money and funded itself with private and public sector polling contracts (grants) from the breakdown of Soviet Union in 1992 to 2003, Levada had not addressed the fact that the polling agency remained a state-owned company as a FGUP (Russian abbreviation for: Federal State Unit). In 2003 the Ministry of Property of the Russian Federation decided to transform FGUP VTsIOM to JSC &quot;Russian Public Opinion Research Center&quot;, 100% share of which was to be held by the state. There still would have been no budget allocated for it from the state and the company was to continue its work based on financing from both private and public institutions. However this change was taken by Yuri Levada as an attempt to affect the outcomes of VTsIOM studies. As a result, the previous VTsIOM employees left the company and followed Yuri Levada to the new established non-governmental Levada Center.

A young political scientist - Valery Fedorov who, as some sources note, was close to the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation headed the office.

VTsIOM carried on research programs introduced by its previous staff and continued to publish the &quot;Monitoring of Public Opinion&quot; journal; in 2003 former editorial board members began publishing a new journal called the &quot;Public Opinion Herald&quot;.

There is conflicting data about response from other Russian sociologists to the breakup of VTsIOM. Some sources reported that every sociologist left with Levada while others claims they were silent, except for Grushin. The dispute over the legality of using the VTsIOM brand in sociological community ended up in 2004 The Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to give VTsIOM the full right of use of the brand &quot;VTsIOM&quot; and prohibited Levada-Center to use it.

When asked about VTsIOM management change during his visit to Columbia University in the United States in September 2003, Russian president Vladimir Putin was supportive of the change in management.

===Present role as the state&#x27;s main sociological research center===
The research priorities today are political ratings, social mood indices, governmental programs, and reforms. VTsIOM still conducts research for the most significant Russian private and public institutions. New - applied and pragmatic focus of research programs is expressed in a change in its slogan - &quot;Information for success!&quot; instead of the former &quot;From opinion – towards understanding&quot;.

==Criticism==
The Center is sometimes criticized by its subjects of study. Gennady Zyuganov (leader of Communist Party of Russian Federation) criticized VTsIOM&#x27;s objectivity when evaluating media request results of VTsIOM study on Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum stating &quot;I think this is an unprofessional study&quot;. According to VTsIOM, Russians supported burying Lenin&#x27;s remains in a cemetery rather than keeping them in the mausoleum.

According to Berlin-based &quot;bne IntelliNews&quot;, VTsIOM’s question about the 2019 Moscow protests was &quot;subtly designed to give a result that supports the government’s point of view.&quot;

==Research==
VTsIOM conducts research on both regional and federal levels, as well as in the post-Soviet space (together with colleagues from the former USSR—members of &quot;Eurasian Monitor&quot; Agency) and other countries.

Topics of interest include:
* Politics: elections, politician approval ratings, protest potential
* Social sphere: education, health care, family, housing, corruption
* Business: finance and insurance, product and corporate brand development, corporate reputation, trademarks, IT and media, auto sector, real estate, sports industry

===Methods===
A wide range of research techniques, such as personal interviews, focus groups, mystery shopping, hall tests, exit polls, expert surveys, and telephone interviews, is used. Research methods include both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, as well as sample building programs. Surveys based on a representative sampling are conducted every week on 1,600 people from 140 places throughout the 42 regions of Russia.

===Selected VTsIOM projects===
VTsIOM regularly coordinates and implements international research projects for foreign and Russian customers such as UNDP, U.S. State Department, NATO Bureau in Moscow and others. Since 2004 the Center has actively participated in designing the system of regular sociological research in the post-Soviet area (in the framework of &quot;Eurasian Monitor&quot;, VTsIOM is one of the founders of Eurasian Monitor as well as other sociological services in the former USSR republics.

<doc id="871109" wikidata="Q135228" url="?curid=871109" title="Bonaventure Island">
<text>Bonaventure Island (officially in ) is a Canadian island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence located off the southern coast of Quebec&#x27;s Gaspé Peninsula, southeast of the village of Percé. Roughly circular in shape, it has an area measuring .

==History==
Bonaventure Island (Île Bonaventure), with Percé, was among the early seasonal fishing ports of New France, and was associated with the lineage of Nicolas Denys. Settlers from southern Ireland came in the early 1790s. Peter Du Val, a native of Jersey, set up a fishery company on lot number one before 1819, population rose to an apex, but the company endured until 1845.

The island became a migratory bird sanctuary in 1919 due to the 1916 Migratory Bird Convention between Canada and the United States. The Province of Quebec acquired ownership of the entire island by act of expropriation in 1971, evicting the whole population. At this time approximately 35 families were forced to move elsewhere, all residents were evicted. Later the Province of Quebec grouped it together with Percé Rock into the Parc national de l&#x27;île-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Percé (Bonaventure Island and Percé Rock National Park) in 1985. One of the largest and most accessible bird sanctuaries in the world, with more than 280,000 birds, Bonaventure Island is a major tourist destination with boat and island tours from May to October.

The aircraft carrier HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; was named after the island.

==Birds==
218 different species of birds have been recorded as visiting, migrating to, or living on Bonaventure island.

The most common bird found on the island is the northern gannet. The island is home to one of the largest colonies of gannets in the world, with 51,700 pairs in 2011. 
Other populous colonies include the black-legged kittiwake and the common murre. Terns, black guillemots, herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, razorbills, Leach&#x27;s storm-petrels, great cormorants, double-crested cormorants, Atlantic puffins, boreal chickadees and blackpoll warblers can also be observed on Bonaventure.

== Poetic landmark ==
Bonaventure Island has been an important source of inspiration to numerous artists and poets. The surrealist writer André Breton declared that, while working on his novel &quot;Arcane 17&quot;, as he stayed in Percé (1944), he would never tire watching the birds of the Island. The island never ceased attracting painters and writers: the American painter Frederick James (d. 1905), Franco-Germans Claire et Yvan Goll (1946)—by the sixties several artists would spend the summer on the island, and would stay over the summer with the inhabitants—descendants of Irish and Norman settlers—the best known of whom was the naturalist William Du Val. Among these inspired visitors: painter Jacques Hurtubise and Kittie Bruneau, the sculptor Morton Rosengarten, the poet Michaël La Chance. Artists and landowners were evicted in the seventies.

<text>Nellie Rose Lutcher (October 15, 1912 – June 8, 2007) was an American R&amp;B and jazz singer and pianist, who gained prominence in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Lutcher was most recognizable for her diction and exaggerated pronunciation and was credited as an influence by Nina Simone among others.

==Childhood==
Lutcher was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the eldest daughter of the 15 children of Isaac and Suzie Lutcher. She was the sister of saxophonist Joe Lutcher. Her father was a bass player and her mother a church organist. She received piano lessons, and her father formed a family band with her playing piano. At age 12, she played with Ma Rainey, when Rainey&#x27;s regular pianist fell ill and had to be left behind in the previous town. Searching for a temporary replacement in Lake Charles, one of the neighbors told Rainey that there was a little girl who played in church who might be able to do it.

==Career==
Aged 15, Lutcher joined her father in Clarence Hart&#x27;s Imperial Jazz Band, and in her mid-teens also briefly married the band&#x27;s trumpet player. In 1933, she joined the Southern Rhythm Boys, writing their arrangements and touring widely. In 1935, she moved to Los Angeles, where she married Leonel Lewis and had a son. She began to play swing piano, and also to sing, in small combos throughout the area, and began developing her own style, influenced by Earl Hines, Duke Ellington and her friend Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole.

She was not widely known until 1947 when she learned of the March of Dimes talent show at Hollywood High School, and performed. The show was broadcast on the radio and her performance caught the ear of Dave Dexter, a scout for Capitol Records. She was signed by Capitol and made several records, including &quot;The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)&quot; and her first hit single, the risqué &quot;Hurry On Down&quot;, which went to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rhythm and blues chart and sold a million copies globally. This was followed by her equally successful composition &quot;He&#x27;s A Real Gone Guy&quot;, which also made No. 2 on the R&amp;B chart and crossed over to the pop chart where it reached No. 15.

In 1948, she had a string of further R&amp;B chart hits, the most successful being &quot;Fine Brown Frame&quot;, her third No. 2 R&amp;B hit. Her songs charted on the pop, jazz, and R&amp;B charts, she toured widely and became well known. She wrote many of her own songs and, unlike many other African-American artists of the period, retained the valuable publishing rights to them.

In 1950, Lutcher duetted with Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole on &quot;For You My Love&quot; and &quot;Can I Come in for a Second&quot;. The same year, her records began to be released in the UK and were actively promoted by radio DJ Jack Jackson. She headlined a UK variety tour, compered by Jackson, with great success, later returning there to tour on her own.

With an orchestra for the first time, Lutcher recorded &quot;The Birth of the Blues&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Near You&quot; in 1951, but she was losing her appeal with the record-buying public and Capitol dropped her the following year. She went on to record, much less successfully, for other labels including Okeh, Decca and Liberty, and gradually wound down her performance schedule.

In 1952, Lutcher was contacted to perform on first a &quot;happy new years&quot; television special, however after she finished her song, it was revealed that she was on the set of, and the honoree of, a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; episode.

She died in Los Angeles in 2007, aged 94. She was the aunt of Latin jazz percussionist Darryl &quot;Munyungo&quot; Jackson and singer Jacquelyn Levy.

<doc id="871113" wikidata="Q6634903" url="?curid=871113" title="List of prisoners with whole life orders">
<text>This is a list of prisoners who have received a whole life order, formerly called a whole life tariff, through some mechanism in jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. From the introduction of the whole life order system in 1983 until an appeal by a prisoner named Anthony Anderson in 2002, a whole life order was set by government ministers. Thereafter only a judicial body could decide to impose such an order. The effect of a whole life order is that the prisoner serves the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

Whole life orders have been reportedly issued in approximately 100 cases since introduction in 1983, although some of these prisoners have since died in custody, or had their sentences reduced on appeal. By 2023, there were believed to be more than 70 prisoners currently serving whole life sentences in England and Wales. These include some of Britain&#x27;s most notorious criminals, including the serial murderer, Rosemary West and the premature baby serial killer, Lucy Letby.

Other criminals such as David Copeland have had their initial minimum sentences increased. His trial judge recommended a minimum of 30 years, but this was eventually increased to a minimum of 50 years by the High Court. Copeland can only be released after 50 years if considered not to be dangerous at that point. This is set to keep him imprisoned until at least 2049 and the age of 73.

Several prisoners serving whole life sentences have challenged the legality of whole life sentences in the High Court or European Court of Human Rights. These include Jeremy Bamber and Gary Vinter, whose second legal challenge to the European Court of Human Rights was successful, although the High Court later ruled that whole life sentences could still be issued as long as they were reviewed within 25 years. Arthur Hutchinson has challenged his sentence several times in both the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights, but has been unsuccessful each time.

Despite the fact that ministers can no longer decide when or if a life sentence prisoner can be considered for parole, they still retain the power to release a prisoner during their sentences on compassionate grounds. This normally includes cases only when a prisoner is incapacitated, seriously ill or of great age.

Several months before ministers were stripped of their powers to set minimum sentences, the High Court also stripped ministers of their power to overrule the Parole Board&#x27;s decision that a life sentence prisoner can be paroled.

==Imposed by Home Secretaries==
Successive Home Secretaries are known to have imposed whole life orders for at least 23 murderers between 1983 and 2002 (note, this list is incomplete). In 2002, a former Junior Home Office Minister during the 1980s, Douglas Hogg, admitted to setting 600 tariffs between 1986 and 1989 on behalf of the Home Secretary.

==Sentenced by judges==
Since the European Court of Human Rights decision, only trial judges and the High Court have had the power to impose a whole life order. In that time, there have been at least 64 instances of trial judges recommending that an offender should never be released.

Several of these prisoners have had their whole life tariffs reduced on appeal by the High Court.
== Quashed whole life orders ==
* Harry Roberts was one of the perpetrators of the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush murders in 1966, in the course of which three police officers were shot dead during a traffic stop on Braybrook Street. Roberts had personally shot two of the three victims, Christopher Head and David Wombwell. At his trial in December 1966, Mr Justice Glyn-Jones sentenced Roberts to a minimum of 30 years in prison with a recommendation that he never be released. He was repeatedly told while in prison that he would never be released, and Home Secretary David Blunkett repeatedly blocked efforts to secure Roberts&#x27; release or transfer to an open prison. Roberts was eventually granted parole in 2014, after spending 48 years in prison.
* Patrick Magee, who bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton in October 1984, killing five people and nearly killing his intended target Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet. He was convicted in 1985 of five counts of murder and several explosive and terrorism offences, with a recommendation that he serve 35 years in prison, which was increased later to whole life by Michael Howard. He was released after 14 years in 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement.
* Joe O&#x27;Connell, Eddie Butler, Hugh Doherty and Harry Duggan were members of IRA active service unit the Balcombe Street Gang, that terrorised London in the mid-1970s, killing six people, injuring many others and planning more attacks which were later foiled or never carried out. They were caught after they took a couple hostage in their flat in Marylebone while attempting to escape police pursuit and surrendered after six days. They were later each given whole life tariffs by the Home Secretary, however they were released as part of the Good Friday Agreement. During their trial they admitted to the Woolwich pub bombing and Guildford pub bombing, which others were convicted of and served time for.
* Harry Mackenney was convicted of four counts of murder in 1980 alongside his co-defendant Terry Pinfold who was convicted of procuring Harry Mackenney to murder business associate Terrence Eve after murderer John Childs turned evidence against the two. He was cleared in 2003 along with Terry Pinfold after spending over 20 years in prison when the court of appeal accepted that John Childs was a compulsive liar. He was originally sentenced to life with a recommended minimum term of 25 years by Mr Justice May, but was told in 1996 by the home secretary that he would never be released.
* Ronald William Barton was convicted of murdering his 14-year-old stepdaughter Keighley Barton in October 1986, in what was believed as an attempt on Barton&#x27;s part to stop Keighley from testifying against him for child abuse and to gain revenge against her mother. He had several previous convictions for gross indecency against Keighley and sexual assault against other teenage girls, one of which he had been in prison for. After his conviction, his trial judge recommended a minimum sentence of 25 years; but the Lord Chief Justice then ruled that life must mean life, which the Home Secretary agreed with. The term was reset in 1997 to the original 25 years, which was reduced again to 23 years in 2006.
* IRA terrorists Thomas Quigley and Paul Kavanagh were both convicted of two murders in a bomb attack in 1981 by the Chelsea Barracks which also injured 39 people. They were both sentenced to 35 years in prison each in 1985 and were told in 1996 by the Home Secretary Michael Howard that they were to receive whole life tariffs, however the order was reversed by the Belfast High Court in 1997 after an appeal by the two men and they were released under the Good Friday Agreement.
* David Wynne Roberts was convicted of murdering a pensioner who was a friend of his grandmother in Anglesey, Wales when he was 14 in 1969 and served seven years in youth detention before being released in 1976 and moving to the North West of England. In 1985, he went to Blackpool where he met a staff from a hotel in Ambleside, Cumbria and stayed with them until he disappeared in early-1986 when the body of the hotel owner was discovered in a cottage, where she was stabbed and strangled with her own scarf. He gave himself in to police in London within a month after the crime and was convicted of murder with a recommended minimum of 18 years, with the Home Secretary setting a whole life tariff in 1988, before being reduced to 22 years in 2005 on appeal.
* John Cannan, who was convicted of the murder of Shirley Banks in Bristol on 8 October 1987, attempted kidnapping of Julia Holman and a rape in Reading. He was sentenced with a recommendation that should never be released from prison by Mr Justice Drake at Exeter Crown Court in April 1989, however this was overturned when the Lord Chief Justice and the Home Secretary at the time decided that he should serve at least 35 years instead.
* Howard Hughes, who was convicted in July 1996 of the Murder of Sophie Hook in Llandudno 12 months earlier. He was jailed for life with a recommendation that he should never be released. In November 2002, Hughes was one of four convicted child murderers who received 50-year minimum terms imposed by the-then Home Secretary David Blunkett shortly before politicians were stripped of their powers to decide minimum terms for life sentence prisoners. The 50-year minimum term meant that Hughes would not be able to apply for parole until 2045 and the age of 80.
* Timothy Morss and Brett Tyler, who murdered nine-year-old Daniel Handley from East London in October 1994 and buried his body near Bristol, where it was found five months later. They were sentenced to life imprisonment in May 1996 and the trial judge recommended that they should never be released, as he felt they would never cease to pose a danger to children. In November 2002, the pair were among four convicted child murderers who were issued with 50-year minimum terms by the then Home Secretary David Blunkett, just before politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners; this meant that Morss and Tyler would both be over 80 years old before parole could be considered.
* Roy Whiting, who murdered Sarah Payne in West Sussex in July 2000, was told by his trial judge when convicted in December 2001 that his crime (combined with the fact that he had a previous conviction for child abduction and indecent assault) was a rare case for which a life sentence should mean life. In November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett ruled that Whiting should serve at least 50 years in prison, meaning he would only qualify for parole if he lived to the age of 92 or beyond, although this in practice revoked the whole life tariff recommended in court. Whiting appealed against this ruling, his lawyers arguing that Blunkett&#x27;s ruling had been politically motivated as he was on the verge of losing his powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners, and that the government was under mounting pressure from the British public due to the recent start of a firefighters strike. The crime had also attracted widespread media and public attention, and led to calls for tighter laws regarding the monitoring of convicted sex offenders. The ruling also came days after the death of Myra Hindley, whose continued imprisonment saw her described by some sources as a &quot;political prisoner&quot; whose sentence was repeatedly increased to serve the interests of the serving government. Whiting&#x27;s appeal was heard in June 2010, when the High Court (which by this stage now had the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner should serve before being considered for parole) reduced Whiting&#x27;s minimum sentence to 40 years, meaning that he will first qualify for parole from 2041 and the age of 82.
* David Morris was convicted in 2002 murdering three generations of the same family in 1999. His victims were 80-year-old Doris Dawson, her 34-year-old daughter Mandy Power and her two granddaughters, 10-year-old Katie and 8-year-old Emily, by beating them with a pole and then setting the house on fire where their bodies were discovered by firefighters and the trial judge said that the &quot;exceptional savagery&quot; of the murders meant that Morris should never be released. However, in July 2007, the sentenced was reduced to a recommendation of 32 years in prison.
* David Bieber, an American former marine who fatally shot an already wounded policeman in the head and wounded two others in Leeds on Boxing Day 2003, also injuring two other officers (which saw him convicted on two counts of attempted murder),was jailed for life in December 2004 with a recommendation he should never be released. The whole life tariff was quashed in July 2008 and replaced by one of 37 years. This means he will be at least 75 before parole can be considered.
* Stephen Ayre, who was paroled in 2005 after serving 20 years of a life sentence for the murder of a 25-year-old woman, committed rape of a 10-year-old boy at knifepoint in Bradford within months of his release. He was sentenced to life imprisonment again at his trial in April 2006, and told that he should never be released, a recommendation normally only made in the case of people convicted of murder. However, his whole life tariff was later quashed on appeal and replaced with a minimum of 10 years. However Ayre was never released and died in prison from lung cancer on September 15, 2018.
* Trevor Hamilton, jailed for life in August 2006 for the murder of 65-year-old librarian Attracta Haron in Northern Ireland in December 2003. Hamilton, who was 21 when he committed the murder and 24 when jailed, had his whole life tariff reduced to 35 years on appeal in June 2008, meaning that he will be in his late fifties before parole can be considered.
* Clement McNally who was serving a life term for stabbing a friend outside a house in 2002, strangled his cellmate Anthony Hesketh in Manchester&#x27;s Strangeways Prison in September 2003 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was given a whole life tariff as a result. In October 2009, it was reduced on appeal to 20 years in prison on account of his mentally abnormal condition.
* Reginald Wilson was convicted in 1991 of murdering skin specialist David Birkett with a hammer in 1990 and was sentenced to life in prison. Three years later he was informed by the Home Secretary that life should mean life. This was reduced to a 30-year tariff in 2008. He has proved to be a disruptive and dangerous prisoner; he tried to stab a prison officer in 1999 and was transferred to the prisons close supervision centre unit where he is held in the exceptional risk unit.
* John Hilton was convicted of murder with two other men, Philip Kelly and Charles Connelly during the Mitcham Co-op Robbery and was sentenced to life in prison, while his accomplice George Thatcher was sentenced to death by hanging for capital murder in 1963, only to have his death sentence quashed soon afterwards and replaced with a life sentence from which he was paroled after 18 years. John Hilton served 15 years and was released on licence in 1978, where a month after he shot and killed a diamond jeweller and accidentally shot his partner who then bled to death, he was then given a whole life tariff. The sentence was later reduced to 25 years in prison in 2009 on account of exceptional progress in prison.
* Peter Bryan killed Nisha Sheth, the daughter of an employer who sacked him for stealing, with a hammer in 1993. He was released in 2004 and by agreement of the doctors at the Newham General Hospital allowed to leave the ward on which he was staying whenever he liked. On this ward, he murdered Bryan Cherry by dismembering him and then eating a part of his brain. When he was admitted to Broadmoor, he killed Richard Loudwell, who was awaiting trial for murder by bashing his head against the floor and strangling him and as a result was given a whole life tariff. It was reduced on appeal to 15 years in 2006 on the basis that the trial judge didn&#x27;t give enough consideration to his mental health.
* Brian Maurice Hogg was convicted alongside Jeremy Wing of raping two young children, leaving them with lifelong trauma and injuries. Hogg also had previous convictions for similar offences against children. Both men received whole-life orders in 2002. An appeal in 2007 later reduced Hogg&#x27;s prison term to life imprisonment with a minimum of ten years on the basis that his crimes were not severe enough to warrant a whole-life order, with Mrs. Justice Swift ruling that the trial judge&#x27;s sentencing of Hogg had been &quot;wrong in principle&quot;. Hogg died from sepsis while still a prisoner in 2015, at the age of 73.
* Danilo Restivo was convicted in 2011 for the 2002 murder of Heather Barnet. In a second trial, Restivo was later sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of a teenager in his native Italy in 1993. In 2012 his term was reduced to 40 years as part of a joint appeal by several prisoners with long sentences.
* Michael Roberts was convicted in 2012 of numerous offences between 1988 and 2005, including rapes. His sentence was reduced to life with a 25-year minimum at the same appeal that reduced Restivo&#x27;s sentence. Roberts was the first person to be sentenced to a whole life term without having committed murder.
* Anthony Entwistle, then aged 38, murdered 16-year-old Michelle Calvy in April 1987, abducting her from a towpath in Blackburn, raping her, and strangling her with her T-shirt. He dumped her body in Tockholes. The murder was 18 days after his release from a 10-year sentence in 1980 for rape, which followed another seven-year sentence in 1974 for sexually assaulting two women. He was found guilty of Calvy&#x27;s murder at Preston Crown Court in March 1988, and sentenced to life imprisonment with trial judge Mr. Justice Rose recommending a minimum term of 25 years. He was later given a whole-life tariff by the Home Secretary Douglas Hurd. In 2009, Mr. Justice Davis ruled at the High Court that Entwistle could be considered for release after 25 years (less 10 months spent on remand) if he was judged to no longer be a threat to the public, rather than imposing a whole life tariff, saying that &quot;He can only be released if ever (and it may be never) he is assessed as no longer a danger to the public.&quot; The parole board turned down his request for release in June 2013.
* David Martin Simmons had originally received a whole-life term for rape and false imprisonment. This was reduced to a ten-year minimum when he appealed alongside Restivo, Roberts, and others whose appeals were not successful.
* Donald Andrews had received a whole-life term for rape and kidnapping in 2012, while having two previous convictions for manslaughter. This was reduced to a twelve-year minimum when he appealed in 2015, making him eligible for release in 2024.
* Simon Smith was convicted of murdering three of his children (all under a year old) between 1989 and 1994, which were initially believed to be cot deaths. His trial judge at Stafford Crown Court in 1996 recommended that he should never be released. Smith was however told at a later date he could apply for parole from 2020 after serving a minimum of 24 years.
* Ian Stewart was convicted of murdering his fiancée Helen Bailey and later his wife Diane Stewart and sentenced to life without parole. However, Stewart appealed to the Court of Appeal and had his sentence for Bailey&#x27;s murder reduced to a minimum of 35 years. Wayne Couzens, who murdered Sarah Everard, appealed alongside Stewart but his whole-life order was upheld.

<text>Cecil André Mesritz (20 August 1909 – 28 November 1978), known professionally as André Morell, was an English actor. He appeared frequently in theatre, film and on television from the 1930s to the 1970s. His best known screen roles were as Professor Bernard Quatermass in the BBC Television serial &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59), and as Doctor Watson in the Hammer Film Productions version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1959). 

He also appeared in the films &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), in several of Hammer&#x27;s horror films throughout the 1960s and in the acclaimed ITV historical drama &quot;The Caesars&quot; (1968). His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper described him as possessing a &quot;commanding presence with a rich, responsive voice… whether in the classical or modern theatre he was authoritative and dependable.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Morell was born in London, the son of André and Rosa Mesritz. Prior to taking up acting professionally he trained as a motor engineer, while also participating in amateur theatrical productions. He turned professional in 1934, initially acting under the name André Mesritz; he anglicised his surname to Morell in 1936, and adopted the latter name legally by deed poll in 1938.

In 1938 he joined the Old Vic theatre company, and appeared in several of their high-profile productions both at their home theatre and on tour throughout Britain and across the rest of the world. He appeared in &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Horatio opposite Alec Guinness in the title role, and as Alonso in John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;The Tempest&quot;. He played Mercutio in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; mounted by the Old Vic company at Streatham in 1939, with Robert Donat as Romeo. This was Morell&#x27;s favourite role from his career. His performance in the play was praised by &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s critic as &quot;a neat and carefully studied portrait; he is admirable in all his cynical and humorous passages&quot;, although the reviewer did add that &quot;one could wish that he had left this manner for the speech about Queen Mab and addressed this, as a piece of direct poetry, directly to the audience.&quot;

Towards the end of the 1930s he began appearing in films, making his debut on the big screen in &quot;13 Men and a Gun&quot; (1938). He appeared frequently in several early drama productions on the BBC&#x27;s fledgling television service, featuring in such roles as Mr Wickham in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1938) and Le Bret in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1938). The onset of the Second World War interrupted his acting career, and he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1940. He served with the regiment until 1946, by which time he had attained the rank of major.

=== Major film and television roles ===

Morell returned to the theatre after the war, including another period at the Old Vic in the 1951–52 season. The &quot;New Statesman&quot;&#x27;s critic T. C. Worsley wrote of his performance in a star-studded revival of &quot;King Lear&quot; that &quot;Mr Morell&#x27;s Kent is the best I remember since Sir Ralph Richardson&#x27;s.&quot; Of his performance in the title role in Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s production of &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote: &quot;From his stage and screen performances we know him already as an eminently dependable actor, but last night he became a spectacular actor.&quot;

The same profile quoted Morell&#x27;s catholic approach to stage assignments: &quot;If a part is a good part and I feel I can enjoy playing it, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s Shakespeare or modern farce … I&#x27;d hate to be bogged down in Shakespeare or classic theatre all my life. It&#x27;s a good thing for an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated.&quot;

However, he now increasingly began to win leading parts on television, and in 1953 was cast by the television director Rudolph Cartier in a play called &quot;It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer&quot;. Cartier was impressed with Morell&#x27;s performance in this play, and offered him the leading role in a science-fiction serial he was preparing with the writer Nigel Kneale, entitled &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. Morell considered the not-yet-completed script, but decided to decline the offer; the part went instead to his co-star from &quot;It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer&quot;, Reginald Tate.

He did take one of the leading parts in another Cartier and Kneale production the following year, when he played O&#x27;Brien in their version of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, opposite Peter Cushing as Winston Smith. This was a successful and controversial production which provoked much comment and debate; Morell&#x27;s part in it has been praised for his &quot;coolly menacing performance [that] is at least equal to Cushing&#x27;s.&quot;

This successful collaboration with Cartier and Kneale resulted, four years later, in him once again being offered the role of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the pair&#x27;s third serial in the series, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, although on this occasion another actor – Alec Clunes – had already turned them down. This time Morell accepted the part, and is regarded by several critics as having provided the definitive interpretation of the character. Morell personally found that in later years it was the role for which he was most often remembered by members of the public.

As well as these and other television appearances, Morell gained several notable film roles towards the end of the 1950s. He appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture; &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), as Colonel Green, and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) as Sextus. 

With Cushing as Sherlock Holmes, he played Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s character Doctor John H. Watson, in Hammer Film Productions&#x27; version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (also 1959). Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories, and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce&#x27;s interpretation of the role. An earlier Hammer film in which Morell appeared was &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot; (1957).

In 1960, Morell appeared as Judge Brack in a production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse. Starring opposite him in the title role was the film actress Joan Greenwood. They fell in love and flew in secret to Jamaica, where they were married, remaining together until his death.

=== Later career ===
Morell continued to appear in Hammer&#x27;s horror films in the ensuing decade. He had parts in the &quot;Shadow of the Cat&quot; (1960), &quot;She&quot; (1964, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel &quot;The Vengeance of She&quot; (1967), the lead in &quot;The Plague of the Zombies&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Shroud&quot; (1966). He also starred with Cushing in Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Cash on Demand&quot;, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, &quot;The Gold Inside&quot;, but turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer&#x27;s feature film adaptation of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1967).

Morell continued to act successfully on television throughout the decade, with guest roles in episodes of series such as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1963 and 1965), &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1965), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (&quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; 1966), &quot;The Saint&quot; (1965) and in &quot;The Caesars&quot; (1968) in a prominent role as the Roman emperor Tiberius.

In 1969, he became the vice president of Equity, the trade union for British actors and performers. He then served as president of the organisation for a year from 1973–74. During this time he was involved in a dispute in which Equity threatened to expel Laurence Olivier as a member due to comments he made in a newspaper feature about the possibility of forming a breakaway union. The union also suffered from financial problems, and Morell continued to warn against destructive divisions amongst the members when he stepped down as president.

Despite his involvement in union business he continued to be a busy working actor. He appeared in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975) as a nobleman friend of the title character. His last television work was an episode of the ITV series &quot;The Professionals&quot; in 1978, the year of his death. The animated film version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, in which he voiced the character of Elrond, was released the same year, but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death. This was as the judge in &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot;.

Morell, who smoked up to 60 cigarettes a day until he gave up in 1976, died from lung cancer in London on 28 November 1978, at the age of 69. He and his wife Joan Greenwood had a son, Jason Morell, who also became an actor, appearing in films such as &quot;Mrs Brown&quot; (1997, as Lord Stanley) and &quot;Wilde&quot; (also 1997, as Ernest Dowson).

<doc id="871120" wikidata="Q7464559" url="?curid=871120" title="Figwit">
<text>Figwit is a fan-created name for a then-unnamed [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] Escort in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series, played by Bret McKenzie of the musical duo Flight of the Conchords. The name Figwit derives from an acronym for &quot;Frodo is great...who is THAT?!?&quot; . The character quickly and unexpectedly became popular among Tolkien fandom, and is perceived as an example of famous for being famous, a view shared by the character&#x27;s actor himself.

==Background==
Bret McKenzie, half of the musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords, first landed a small role as an extra in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. He appears sitting next to Aragorn during the council in Rivendell scene. The elf was dubbed &quot;Figwit&quot; by fan Iris Hadad; after seeing Frodo agree to take the ring, saying &quot;I will take it&quot;, the film switches to a shot where Figwit can be seen standing on the far right, and Hadad&#x27;s initial reaction was &quot;Frodo is great...who is THAT?!?&quot; Later, Hadad corresponded with her university friend Sherry de Andres, and the two created the first Figwit fan website, www.figwitlives.net, calling him &quot;Legolas for the thinking woman&quot;.

McKenzie appeared as Figwit again in the third film, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, where he was credited as &quot;Elf Escort&quot;. He appears in the scene where Arwen is leaving for the Grey Havens and has a vision of her future son, Eldarion, this time with two lines warning her to not delay and then exclaiming as she turns around. Director Peter Jackson stated in the DVD commentary for &quot;The Return of the King&quot; that Figwit was called back and given dialogue in the third film &quot;just for fun for the fans&quot; because &quot;so much fuss has been made about him over the last couple of years&quot;.

McKenzie played another elf in &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, Lindir, who has a brief appearance in the novel &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. McKenzie has stated that Lindir and Figwit are different characters.

==Popularity==
Though he only appeared for about three seconds in &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Figwit&#x27;s popularity soon blossomed, with Hadad stating that &quot;[the fan site] got a lot of e-mails from people who thought they were the only ones who had noticed that handsome, dark-haired elf&quot;. Figwit&#x27;s physical appearance and demeanor are the source of much of his popularity: he has been noted for his &quot;lithe and graceful&quot; movement, &quot;enigmatic broodiness&quot;, &quot;haughty demeanor&quot;, and &quot;pouty&quot; looks. His fan website proclaims him &quot;in a word, gorgeous. Or another, stunning... hypnotic... stupendous... captivating... take your pick.&quot;

McKenzie has stated that the Figwit obsession is &quot;weird,&quot; though he is &quot;flattered.&quot; He has remarked that &quot;it&#x27;s so hilarious because it&#x27;s been propelled by so little ... I&#x27;m famous for doing nothing.&quot;

=== In other media ===

Figwit does not appear in Tolkien&#x27;s writings and was created exclusively for the films; thus there is little authentic information regarding him, save that he is a royal escort. The only &quot;official&quot; place where the name Figwit is used is on several Topps trading cards, including a &quot;The Return of the King&quot; series card, titled &quot;Return to Rivendell,&quot; and an Authentic Autographs card featuring the signature of actor Bret McKenzie. In &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot; he was assigned the name of Aegnor, one of Galadriel&#x27;s brothers in &quot;The Silmarillion.&quot; A Figwit action figure was also created, though it was named &quot;Elven Escort,&quot; as in the film.

Figwit has been a subject of poetry, art, and fiction, in particular in the slash genre of Tolkien fan fiction, where he is named &quot;Melpomaen&quot;. This is a chimera translation of &quot;figwit&quot; from two of Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish languages: &quot;melpo&quot;, Quenya for &quot;fig&quot;, and &quot;maen&quot;, Noldorin for clever or skilled.

=== Documentary ===
In 2004, a 57-minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon was created by McKenzie&#x27;s fiancée (and now wife) Hannah Clarke and friends Stan Alley and Nick Booth. Entitled &quot;Frodo Is Great... Who Is That?!!&quot;, it premiered at the Auckland International Film Festival on July 23. Meant to &quot;[unravel] Bret&#x27;s identity&quot;, it follows McKenzie to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and &quot;elvish good looks&quot;, and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as with Peter Jackson, Barrie Osborne, Mark Ordesky, Ian McKellen, and other cast members. Booth stated that their film was &quot;much more irreverent and strange&quot; compared to other behind-the-scenes documentaries of the film trilogy, which were &quot;very much driven around the production and the cast and Tolkien&quot;.

<text>iSketch was a drawing browser game that was similar to Pictionary. It was launched by Robert Wahlstedt on June 15, 1999, and was written in Adobe Shockwave. As of April 9, 2019, support for Adobe Shockwave was discontinued, and the game ceased to function correctly and has not been updated.

==Gameplay==

The objective of &quot;iSketch&quot; is to score points by guessing words. Each player gets a turn as the &quot;artist&quot;, in which they draw a word or phrase while the other players attempt to guess it. The artist can use a mouse or graphics tablet to draw, and is given a set of on-screen drawing tools including pens, brushes, an eraser, a fill tool, and a color palette. When another player successfully guesses the word or phrase, both that player and the artist score points. The artist scores additional points for each additional player who also successfully guesses the phrase before time runs out, while each additional player scores one point less than the player before them.

&quot;iSketch&quot; provides word lists in more than twenty languages, multiple difficulty levels, and numerous themes. There are several game variations, including Blitz (in which the round ends immediately as soon as a player guesses the word), Tandem (where two artists work together), Big Picture (in which two unrelated words must be combined into a single drawing), Connections (where the previous word must be somehow incorporated into the current drawing), and 5 Strokes (where the artist has just five pen strokes to express his/her subject).

In addition to the game&#x27;s predefined rooms, players may create either custom rooms, where they tailor the game settings and choose from all of the available word lists, or chat rooms.

==Moderation==

In most circumstances, the rules forbid players from writing letters or words in the puzzle, using various forms of code to spell out the words, etc. Established &quot;iSketch&quot; users (players who have been on the site for a predetermined amount of time) are given the ability to help moderate the game in order to ensure fairness and adherence to the rules. Players who see the artist writing or drawing inappropriately may vote against the player, and if enough votes are sent, the artist is skipped and any points gained from the round are cancelled. Players may also report other players for cheating or engaging in inappropriate behavior.

Administrators are notified whenever votes are cast and behavior reports are sent for site-provided rooms. They may monitor games visibly or invisibly, and may choose to support the vote by kicking offensive players out of the game or even banning them from the site. Alternatively, an administrator can also suspend a player&#x27;s ability to vote if he/she feels it is being abused. Users who create their own rooms have full administrative powers in those rooms, similar to IRC Operators.
