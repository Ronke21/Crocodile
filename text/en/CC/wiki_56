<text>Stella Nina McCartney (born 13 September 1971) is an English fashion designer. She is a daughter of British singer-songwriter Paul McCartney and the American photographer and animals rights activist Linda McCartney. Like her parents, McCartney is a supporter of animal rights and environmentalism, and uses vegetarian and animal-free alternatives in her work. Since 2005, she has designed an activewear collection for Adidas.

==Early life==

McCartney was born on 13 September 1971 at King&#x27;s College Hospital in Denmark Hill, Camberwell, London. She is named after her maternal great-grandmothers (both of Linda&#x27;s grandmothers were named Stella). Her mother, Linda Eastman McCartney, was of Jewish ancestry. As a girl, McCartney travelled the globe with her parents and their group Wings, along with her siblings: older half-sister Heather (who was legally adopted by Paul), older sister Mary, and younger brother James. According to her father, the name Wings was inspired by Stella&#x27;s difficult delivery. As his daughter was being born by emergency caesarean section, Paul sat outside the operating room and prayed that she would be born &#x27;on the wings of an angel&#x27;.

Despite their fame, the McCartneys wanted their children to live as normal a life as possible, so Stella and her siblings attended local state schools in East Sussex, one of them being Bexhill College. McCartney has said that while attending state school, she was a victim of bullying yet she had been a bully herself.

==Career==

===Beginning===
McCartney became interested in designing clothes as a youth. At the age of 13, she designed her first jacket. Three years later, she interned for Christian Lacroix, working on her first haute couture collection, honing her skills while working for Edward Sexton (her father&#x27;s Savile Row tailor) for a number of years.

McCartney studied her foundation at Ravensbourne College of Design and Communication now Ravensbourne University London, followed by fashion design at Central Saint Martins in the early 1990s, graduating in 1995. Her graduation collection was modelled for free by friends and supermodels Naomi Campbell, Yasmin Le Bon and Kate Moss, at the graduation runway show, presented to a song especially written by her father, &quot;Stella May Day&quot;.

A lifelong vegetarian, McCartney uses no leather or fur in her designs. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described her in 2015 as a &#x27;consistent and vocal&#x27; supporter of animal rights. Some of McCartney&#x27;s designs have text that elaborates on her &#x27;no animal&#x27; policy; one of her Adidas jackets carries a sleeve that says &#x27;suitable for sporty vegetarians&#x27;. A pair of her vinyl and ultrasuede boots were marketed specifically as vegan-friendly, though her use of oil-based synthetics still raised ecological concerns.

===Rise to prominence and continued success===
In 1997, McCartney was named the creative director of Chloé, a position she held until 2001.

In 2001, McCartney launched a fashion house under her name, in a joint venture with Gucci Group (now Kering), and presented her first collection in Paris. She now operates 51 freestanding stores in Manhattan&#x27;s Soho, London&#x27;s Mayfair, LA&#x27;s West Hollywood, Paris&#x27;s Palais Royal, Barcelona&#x27;s Passeig de Gracia, Milan, Rome, Miami and Houston, among other locations.

In 2003, McCartney launched her first perfume, Stella. In January 2007, she launched a 100% organic skincare line, CARE, which includes seven products, from a cleansing milk made with lemon balm and apricot, to green tea and linden blossom floral water.

In 2008, McCartney launched a new lingerie line with Bendon Group. In November 2010, the Stella McCartney Kids collection was launched for newborns and children up to age 12.

 In June 2012, McCartney invited the Soul Rebels Brass Band to perform at her 2013 spring fashion presentation at the New York Marble Cemetery in New York City. Other guests invited to the party included Anne Hathaway, Jim Carrey, Anna Wintour, Annie Leibovitz, Lauren Hutton, Amy Poehler, Solange Knowles, P&#x27;Trique, Greta Gerwig and André Leon Talley. Also in 2012, McCartney was part of &quot;The Sustainable Fashion Handbook&quot;.

In November 2016, McCartney launched her first menswear collection, made up of many athleisure, pyjama-like casual outfits. She said her father, as well as comedian Jethro, inspired the collection.

In April 2018, after 17 years of partnership with Kering, McCartney purchased its stake in her company and took full control of her global fashion empire. The following year, she signed a strategic partnership with LVMH. She designed the wedding reception dress worn by Meghan Markle, and later created 46 replicas of it (23 in lily white and 23 in onyx black) for her &quot;Made With Love&quot; capsule collection, each priced at £3,500.

On 15 October 2018, McCartney launched the Stella McCartney Cares Foundation, a charity dedicated to breast cancer. (McCartney&#x27;s mother Linda died of breast cancer in 1998.) The charity aimed to donate 1,000 of the brand&#x27;s Louis Listening post-operative mastectomy compression bras to women undergoing breast cancer treatment.

On 21 November 2021, McCartney launched &quot;The Beatles: Get Back&quot; a collection inspired by the Beatles.

In 2023, McCartney performed a spoken word piece at the Coronation Concert, to mark the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

In January 2025, McCartney purchased back LVMH&#x27;s shares in her label.

===Collaborations===
McCartney launched a joint-venture line with Adidas, establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation in September 2004. This was a sports performance collection for women.

In January 2010, McCartney announced she would be collaborating with Disney to create a jewellery collection inspired by &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. In July of the same year, together with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and eco-designer Atom cianfarani, McCartney worked to petition the British Ministry of Defence to cease the use of Canadian Black Bears as the fur for their guards&#x27; hats; the military is yet to make the change.

In July 2011, McCartney participated at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.

In December 2018, McCartney announced the launch of a new fashion industry charter for climate action, in collaboration with the United Nations, to help fashion companies welcome sustainable business practices.

In August 2019, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift teamed up with McCartney to release a fashion line inspired by Swift&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Lover&quot;, the project carrying the title &quot;Stella X Taylor Swift&quot;.

===Team GB===
In September 2010, McCartney was appointed Team GB&#x27;s Creative Director for the 2012 Olympics by Adidas – the first time in the games&#x27; history that a leading fashion designer designed the apparel for a country&#x27;s team across all competitions for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. In March 2012, the Team GB kit was publicly displayed. McCartney continued in this role for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

==Honours, awards and media==

McCartney received the VH1/&quot;Vogue&quot; Designer of the Year award in 2000 in New York. Her father Paul presented the award to her; she thanked him in her acceptance speech and dedicated the award to her late mother Linda. This was followed by the Woman of Courage Award for work against cancer at the prestigious Unforgettable Evening event (2003, Los Angeles), the &quot;Glamour&quot; Award for Best Designer of the Year (2004, London), the Star Honoree at the Fashion Group International Night of the Stars (2004, New York), the Organic Style Woman of the Year Award (2005, New York), the &quot;Elle&quot; Style Award for Best Designer of the Year Award (2007, London), Best Designer of the Year at the British Style Awards (2007, London), Best Designer of The Year at the Spanish Elle Awards (2008, Barcelona), and the Green Designer of the Year at the ACE Awards (2008, New York).

In 2009, she was honoured by the NRDC, featured in the Time 100 and recognised as &quot;Glamour&quot; Woman of the Year. In November 2011, she was presented with the Red Carpet Award by the British Fashion Council; and in the 2013 New Year Honours, she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to fashion.

In 2012, McCartney was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his artwork – the album cover for The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires. The same year, McCartney won the &#x27;Designer of the Year&#x27; and the &#x27;Designer Brand&#x27; awards at the Fashion Awards.

In February 2013 she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman&#x27;s Hour on BBC Radio 4.

In June 2017, McCartney appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, selecting &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; by Talking Heads and &quot;Blackbird&quot; by the Beatles, and her favourite &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by the Beach Boys. She would later receive the Special Recognition Award for Innovation at the 2017 Fashion Awards

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours in recognition of her services to fashion and sustainability.

In 2024, PETA named McCartney their &quot;Person of the Year,&quot; citing her work as a designer to &quot;embrace creative, animal-friendly materials.&quot;

==Personal life==
McCartney married British publisher Alasdhair Willis on 30 August 2003 at Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute. Her wedding dress was an updated version of her mother&#x27;s wedding dress from 1969. Willis works as creative director of shoewear brand Adidas.

McCartney and Willis have four children: sons Miller Alasdhair James Willis (born 2005) and Beckett Robert Lee Willis (born 2008) and daughters Bailey Linda Olwyn Willis (born 2006) and Reiley Dilys Stella Willis (born 2010). Her children appeared with her on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;.

McCartney has a younger half-sister, Beatrice Milly McCartney, born on 28 October 2003 to her father and his second wife, Heather Mills.

In 2018, McCartney said: &quot;When my mum died, Dad, my brother and I went to see the Maharishi... I had quite a reaction that I didn&#x27;t feel in control of. I possibly suppressed my emotions and I started having panic attacks, physical reactions to that loss.&quot; She said that transcendental meditation made an almost instantaneous difference in her ability to cope, stating: &quot;It really did help me at a time when I really needed some help.&quot;

In 2023, McCartney&#x27;s plan to build a house in a remote place in Scotland, for which she also planned to cut down trees received more than 50 objections to the local council, many on environmental grounds.

<doc id="860653" wikidata="Q1472255" url="?curid=860653" title="International Four Days Marches Nijmegen">
<text>The International Four Day Marches Nijmegen (, ) is the largest multiple-day marching event in the world, with tens of thousands of participants. It is organised every year in Nijmegen, Netherlands in mid-July as a means of promoting sport and exercise. Participants walk , or daily, depending on their age and gender and, on completion, receive a royally approved medal (Vierdaagsekruis). The participants are mostly civilians, with a few thousand military participants as well. Military participants&#x27; distance is 40 km, in uniform, carrying at least marching weight for men aged 18–49; for women, the weight is optional.

==Summary==
The &quot;Vierdaagse&quot; (, ) is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909. Based at Nijmegen since 1925, it now takes place in the third week of July. In 2016 it celebrated the 100th edition (reflecting that the marches were curtailed during the two world wars). Originally a military event with a few civilians, it now is a mainly civilian event. Numbers have risen in recent years, with over 40,000 taking part annually, including about 5,000 military, and is the world&#x27;s largest walking event. Due to possible congestion on the route, since 2004 the organisers have limited the number of participants. Many take part every year, including several who have taken part in over 60 annual marches. The record is held by Bert van der Lans, who completed his seventy-first march in 2018, at the age of 86.

Each day of the marches is named for the biggest town on the daily route. Tuesday is the day of Elst, Wednesday the day of Wijchen, Thursday the day of Groesbeek and Friday the day of Cuijk. The routes always remain the same unless there is a specific need to change. This happened in 2007 when the walkers went along the Waalkade, beside the River Waal, on Wednesday for the first time due to congestion on the original route. The 2006 march was the first to be cancelled since World War II, after extreme heat caused thousands of drop-outs and two deaths during the first day&#x27;s march. Following the 2006 cancellation, it was decided that the organising committee would adjust the start time/distance/finish time to manage the event, instead of outright cancellation. The 2016 centenary event responded to unusually hot conditions by adjusting starting times and/or increasing the valid finishing time to reflect the difficulty of the course. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, both the 2020 and 2021 Vierdaagse events were cancelled.

On Fridays of the event, as participants near the finish, the public presents walkers with gladioli, a symbol of victory since Roman times, when gladiators were likewise showered with these flowers. The entry into the city and towards the finish, along the St. Annastraat, is for that reason called Via Gladiola during the event. As far as a week ahead of that Friday, people will reserve spaces alongside the Via Gladiola by placing chairs and even couches. The finish is broadcast on Dutch television.

==Awards==

The marching event has three different types of awards:
* Cross for the Four Day Marches (Dutch: Vierdaagsekruis): awarded to participants who successfully complete all four days. The medal is an official Dutch decoration that can be worn on a Dutch military uniform. Its full name is &quot;Cross for demonstrated marching skill&quot;, defined by Royal Decree on 6 October 1909. Each year a walker receives a specific medal in bronze, silver or gold, with or without a crown, as well as ribbon numbers of varying design, to denote the number of times the event has been completed.
* Group Medal of the Four Day Marches
* Orderly Medal of the Four Day Marches (not an official award since 2017)

==History==
===Early years===
In April 1908 the Dutch League for Physical Education, (&quot;Nederlandsche Bond Voor Lichamelijke Opvoeding&quot;, or &quot;NBVLO&quot;) was established to promote participation in physical activities across the Netherlands, including organising sports events. In September 1909 the NBVLO organised the first Vierdaagse. Planned primarily as a military training event, fifteen separate four-day routes were prepared across the country, each route totalling . Four of the routes were however cancelled at short notice, three due to an outbreak of cholera in Rotterdam and one due to poor road conditions. In total, 306 soldiers and ten civilians took part. Military participants who completed all four days received the newly instituted Vierdaagse Cross.

From 1910 the Vierdaagse became an annual event, based in a different town each year, although mobilisation during World War I meant that no marches took place in 1914 or 1915. In 1919 the first woman completed the route. In 1925 the event was held in Nijmegen, and from then this became the permanent centre for the event.

With Amsterdam hosting the Olympic Games, in 1928 the Four Days Marches became international, with teams taking part from Germany, Great Britain and Norway. Non-Dutch participation continued, with the first Swiss group taking part in 1933. From the 1920s the numbers of walkers increased significantly. In 1920 under 500 had taken part, compared with 1,155 in 1928. In 1931 numbers exceeded 2,000 for the first time, with over 3,000 in 1935 and over 4,000 in 1937. The increase was mainly due to greater civilian participation, civilians outnumbering servicemen in all marches from 1932.

After a successful trial event in 1935, four-day marches were held annually at various locations across the Dutch East Indies between 1936 and 1939. Organised by the Dutch Indies Athletic Union under the auspices of the NBVLO, these events adhered to the same regulations as the Nijmegen event, with successful participants receiving the same awards, including the Vierdaagse Cross, and the Group Medal.

The 1940 Vierdaagse was cancelled after the German invasion, with a local Nijmegen walking club organising an emergency (&quot;nood&quot; in Dutch) Four-Days March in August 1940. About 1,000 walkers took part each day, rising to over 2,000 on the final day, with many participants attending from across the country. In 1941 the NBVLO planned a vierdaagse based in Nijmegen. Preparation for the July event included publication of the official rules, which forbade any political display, including uniforms and flags. In spite of this, the march was banned by the German authorities. A number of small scale four-day walking events did however take place in 1941, including a number of less formal evening walks. With unauthorised gatherings increasingly restricted, no further events were organised before the end of the war.

===Since 1945===
Despite Nijmegen suffering considerable war damage, the Vierdaagse recommenced in Nijmegen in 1946 with over 4,000 participants.
The popularity of the Four Days Marches continued to increase, breaking the 10,000 barrier in 1954. The participation in 1967 of Prince Claus, husband of Queen Beatrix, helped to boost the event&#x27;s popularity yet further, with over 20,000 taking part in 1982 and 30,000 by 1988. The number of participants now regularly exceeds 40,000. Due to this growth, since 2004 there has been an upper limit on the number taking part, with a record 48,986 registering for the 100th March in 2016. This increase has been boosted by a rising number attending from across the world. In 2019 6,347 non-Dutch walkers from 73 countries took part.

In 1972 hot weather led to a shortening of the distances by each day. In 2006, the event was again affected by extreme heat, when it was cancelled after the first day after two participants died and many others required medical attention. Given the hot weather forecast for the following days, the organisers decided to cancel the final three days of the walk, with a special badge awarded to participants instead of the cross.

On 17 July 2014, flight MH17 was shot down, with 192 people from the Netherlands onboard. In memory of the crash, no music was played on the last day of the marches, and the festivities were subdued. The 100th Four Days Marches took place in July 2016, celebrated by numerous side events, including an optional daily route—the maximum official distance until 1967.

Both the 2020 and the 2021 events were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In both years, an &quot;Alternatieve Vierdaagse&quot; was organised, with walkers completing the four days in their local area, thereby avoiding large groups. Even though the full Nijmegen March was organised in 2022, the &quot;Alternatieve Vierdaagse&quot; continued for those who did not take part in the main march. These walks did not count towards the Vierdaagse Cross, although participants could buy a souvenir medal.

In 2022, due to extreme heat with predicted peaks of 39 degrees Celsius, the first day of the March was cancelled, with the 2022 march becoming a three-day event.

===Military participation===
Originally primarily a military training event for the Dutch infantry, since 1928 the Vierdaagse has attracted armed forces personnel from other countries, when Germany and Norway sent army teams. Military teams increased greatly after 1945. The U.S. Army first took part in 1947, the United Kingdom in 1950 and Canada in 1952, with service contingents now also regularly travelling from Germany, Scandinavia, Switzerland and others. In recent years military participants, including Dutch personnel, have numbered approximately five thousand, most marching in teams of between eleven and thirty members. They are required to carry at least 10 kilogrammes of dead weight (if they are over 18 years of age), although this requirement can be waived when temperatures get too high, as happened in 2006 and the last day of the 2014 march. Military teams have their own route, (40 km), starting in the military camp Heumensoord, just south of Nijmegen, which is built for the event every year.

==Vierdaagsefeesten==
During the week of the Vierdaagse the accompanying festivities (known as the Vierdaagsefeesten) always draw a large crowd. It is known as one of the biggest festivities in the Netherlands, drawing a crowd of nearly 1 million visitors. It starts on the Saturday before the marches, and ends on the Friday. There is free music during the week, and special events on each day, such as a firework display on Sunday night. Amongst the festivities is the annual rock festival, Valkhof Festival, that takes place every day during the &quot;Vierdaagsefeesten&quot;.

==Recent marches==

&quot;*&quot; Due to predicted extreme heat on Tuesday 19 July, the first march day was cancelled, with the 2022 march becoming a three-day event.

<text>Etzenricht is a municipality in the Upper Palatinate, ca. southeast of Weiden in the district of Neustadt an der Waldnaab in Bavaria in Germany.

Etzenricht has 1,532 inhabitants (Dec. 2020) and various small industries. East of Etzenricht toward Rothenstadt is a transformer station of the E.ON AG with the GKK Etzenricht (described below) and a large compressor station for natural gas. Near Etzenricht are numerous fish-rich small waters, which can be used by anglers after obtaining a fishing license from the local fishery association.

==History==
Etzenricht was mentioned for the first time in a written document in 1270. In 1283 it was mentioned in the Salbuch of Louis II (&quot;Ludwig der Strenge&quot; as &quot;Aechswinreuth&quot;. The inhabitants of Etzenricht lived at that time on honey production and agriculture. The Reformer Jan Huss visited Etzenricht in 1414, on his way to the council of Konstanz. During the war from 1618 to 1648 Etzenricht was destroyed in 1631. In 1875, a railway was built and the town got its own railway station in 1877. Until the completion of the Catholic Church in 1932, Evangelical and Catholic services in Etzenricht took place in the same church.

A transformer station of the Bayernwerk AG (now E.ON AG) was built near Etzenricht and was expanded several times in subsequent years. A HVDC back-to-back facility called GKK Etzenricht was installed there from 1991 to 1993, which made the name of the municipality Etzenricht supraregionally popular.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Anamizu has declined over the past 50 years.
==History==
The area around Anamizu was part of ancient Noto Province. During the Sengoku Period (1467–1568), the area was contested between the Hatakeyama clan, Uesugi clan and Maeda clan, with the area becoming part of Kaga Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organised into Fugeshi District, Ishikawa. The village of Anamizu was established on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on August 10, 1903. Anamizu annexed the neighbouring villages of Shimazaki and Tobo on April 1, 1908; the villages of Kabuto and Sumiyoshi on March 31, 1954; and the village of Morohashi on March 10, 1955.

Anamizu and its surrounding area experienced the 2007 Noto earthquake on March 25, 2007, and the 2024 Noto earthquake on 1 January 2024. After the disaster, the survivors were housed in the municipal stadium named after sumo wrestler Endō, a native of Anamizu. Considered a local hero in his hometown, his &quot;sanshō&quot; trophies are displayed there. On 6 February 2024, Endō was part of a delegation of wrestlers from the prefecture (along with Ōnosato, Kagayaki and former Tochinonada); charged with symbolically presenting Governor Hiroshi Hase with the sums raised during the January tournament and donations from the Sumo Association.

After his first wife filed for divorce in 1979, Collins began to write songs during a break in activity from Genesis with much of the material concerning his personal life. The album was recorded from mid-1980 to early 1981 with Collins and Hugh Padgham as producers. Additional musicians include the Phenix Horns, Alphonso Johnson, and Eric Clapton.

&quot;Face Value&quot; was an instant commercial success and reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart for three weeks and No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has since sold over 5 million copies in the US and over 1.5 million in the UK. The album received widespread praise from critics and launched Collins&#x27; solo career whose commercial success would ultimately outstrip that of Genesis. Its lead single &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, released in January 1981, reached No. 2 on the UK singles chart and became known for its drum arrangement and use of gated reverb. In January 2016, &quot;Face Value&quot; was reissued with bonus tracks and new photography in the style of the original but featuring a present-day Collins.

==Background and writing==
By 1978, Phil Collins had been a member of English progressive rock band Genesis for almost eight years. After spending the first five as their drummer, he reluctantly accepted the role of frontman of the group in 1975 following the departure of the band&#x27;s original singer, Peter Gabriel. Three years later, after departure of guitarist Steve Hackett, Genesis&#x27; nine-month world tour to promote &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; (1978) became problematic for Collins&#x27;s wife Andrea who complained that he was not at home enough and that should he commit to the full tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, maintained that the band were on the cusp of international breakthrough and the tour would pay dividends for the future. However, at the end of the tour, Andrea decided to take their two children to her parents in Vancouver, Canada. In an attempt to save his marriage, Collins moved to Vancouver, but the attempt failed. Collins returned to England in April 1979, with Andrea having agreed to return with the children.

With Genesis members Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford working on their solo albums through 1979, Collins used some of his spare time to write songs. He told &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; early that year:

In his home in Shalford, Surrey, named Old Croft, Collins set up a Sequential Prophet-5 synthesiser, piano, Roland CR-78 drum machine, and an 8-track tape machine in his bedroom, and recorded a collection of demos with backing tracks and early lyrics. He was not concerned with the quality of the recordings as what may have lacked in the recordings would have been salvaged with the emotion in the songs. There were numerous times where Collins stopped recording earlier than planned as the ideas were not working in the studio, leaving him to resume the following day. Collins based the majority of &quot;Face Value&quot; on the divorce he had endured, and used a solo album as an outlet for his feelings.

During the conception of the album, Collins had forged a close friendship with John Martyn and contributed towards &quot;Grace and Danger&quot; (1980), which contained a similar narrative relating to divorce and relationship breakdown. Some of Collins&#x27; material that he had written was performed by Genesis on &quot;Duke&quot; (1980), including &quot;Misunderstanding&quot;, the arrangement of which remained unchanged. He had played &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;If Leaving Me is Easy&quot; to the group, but they were left out as Collins said they were &quot;too simple for the band&quot;.

Early album titles included &quot;Interiors&quot; and &quot;Exposure&quot;. To release the album, Collins signed a solo contract with Virgin Records for UK distribution. He did so to &quot;leave the nest&quot; and to ensure he could maintain full creative control over the music. Collins also felt that releasing the album on Charisma Records, the same label as Genesis, would have harmed its success due to the preconceived notions people have about bands and labels. Collins thought a new label would benefit the casual listener and appeal to a wider audience. Virgin gave Collins a £65,000 advance on the album.

==Production==
===Recording===
Recording sessions for &quot;Face Value&quot; took place at the Town House in London and the Village Recorder in Los Angeles between August and December 1980. The demos recorded onto 8-track were transferred onto 24-track. According to &quot;Classic Albums&quot;, in what was considered a controversial move at the time, Collins, who grew up listening to American R&amp;B as a child in Chiswick, decided to incorporate an R&amp;B horn section, hiring the Phenix Horns, who played backup for Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Collins had asked a contact who knew the group if they were interested in playing, and upon their agreement their leader Thomas &quot;Tom Tom 84&quot; Washington met with Collins who asked him to sing the sections where the horns were to be placed into a tape recorder. The group recorded their parts the following day.

Collins produced the album himself with assistance from Hugh Padgham, who would co-produce several of Collins and Genesis&#x27;s subsequent albums in the 1980s. Initially he considered George Clinton, Maurice White, or Phil Ramone until he realised that he merely wanted someone to endorse his own ideas. Assistant recording engineer Nick Launay was hired after Collins was impressed with his work with Public Image Ltd. Collins was dissatisfied with initial test cuts of the album, describing them like a Queen album, &quot;big, British and upfront&quot;. He then listened to several albums by black musicians including ones by The Jacksons and a collection of soul artists in his own collection, and noticed a common link with technician Mike Reese who worked at a Los Angeles mastering lab. Reese prepared a cut which Collins was satisfied with.

===Songs===
The simple style of music on &quot;Face Value&quot; was reasoned by Collins as his fondness of Weather Report&#x27;s simple melodies and for black music. Collins controversially included drum programming rather than just live drum instrumentation despite his reputation as a drummer. Collins said he wanted to experiment with different sounds and was inspired by the work of his former bandmate Peter Gabriel, who had used drum programming on his last album; Collins was part of these sessions. Many of the songs&#x27; arrangements were done by Collins and session arranger Thomas &quot;Tom Tom 84&quot; Washington. He incorporated Indian-styled violins, played by L. Shankar, for additional textures.

The last recording session for &quot;Face Value&quot; was in January 1981, prior to the release of the first single, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;. Atlantic CEO Ahmet Ertegun advised Collins to perform drums during the verses and opening of the song, whereas the album version does not feature live drumming until the bridge.

The album features songs of different genres. While technically a rock and pop offering, the basis of many of the tracks lies in R&amp;B with light funk influences, especially in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Moving&quot;, for which Collins sang his backgrounds with a vocoder. &quot;Droned&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; are progressive rock instrumentals, with the first featuring an Indian raga sound, while &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; features jazz elements, a black children&#x27;s choir from Los Angeles humming the music, and improvisational instrumentation by Collins and the Phenix Horns. &quot;The Roof Is Leaking&quot; has Delta blues and country elements. &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; was originally recorded by Genesis on &quot;Duke&quot; album as a progressive rock number. Collins worked up a horn-driven R&amp;B/funk-inspired arrangement after speeding up the tape on the Genesis version and thinking that the sped-up version sounded like a Michael Jackson song. The cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; includes instruments and vocals playing in reverse while Collins provided multi-layered background vocals and sparse drumming. After the song ends, Collins can be heard quietly singing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; in reference to the recent murder of John Lennon; this final song is unlisted on most releases of the album (the original US cassette version being an exception), and marks the only time Collins used a hidden track on one of his own releases.

Four songs Collins wrote during the &quot;Face Value&quot; sessions were ultimately omitted: &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; which appeared in the Genesis album &quot;Duke&quot;, &quot;How Can You Just Sit There&quot; (which evolved into his 1984 single &quot;Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)&quot;), and what would become &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot;, which would not appear until Collins&#x27; third album &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; in 1985. According to Collins &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Steal Your Heart Away&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t It Wait &#x27;Til Morning&quot; (from his 1982 follow-up &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;) were written during the &quot;Face Value&quot; sessions.

===Packaging===
Collins regarded &quot;Face Value&quot; as a highly personal project, which gave rise to the iconic cover art with Collins&#x27; face in extreme close-up, originally intended to symbolise the listener &quot;getting into his head&quot;; the reverse side of the sleeve shows the rear of his head, although the CD version of the album placed this image on the insert card instead. To emphasise the personal nature of the album, Collins also hand wrote all of the liner and sleeve notes, even down to the legal statements on the outer circumference of the centre label of the disc itself. Both of the main visual elements of &quot;Face Value&quot; – the facial close-up, and the handwritten notes – would become a motif of Collins&#x27; subsequent albums until 1996&#x27;s &quot;Dance into the Light&quot;. When crediting the musicians in the liner notes, rather than write &quot;Phil Collins&quot;, Collins simply wrote &quot;Me&quot;, although in future albums he would write his initials &quot;PC&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Face Value&quot; became an immediate success, reaching No. 1 in the UK, Canada, and other European countries, while peaking in the top ten in the US. &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; became the album&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching No. 2 in the UK, No. 1 in three other countries, and becoming a top twenty hit in the US. Other songs such as &quot;I Missed Again&quot; found modest success reaching No. 14 in the UK and No. 19 in the US, while the third single, &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy&quot;, reached No. 17 in the UK but was not released in America. Sales of the album reached five million in the US and went five-times platinum in the UK and ten-times platinum in Canada. No solo tour was produced from this album – Collins immediately resumed working with Genesis for the album &quot;Abacab&quot; upon the album&#x27;s completion.

==Critical reception==
Robin Smith of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; highlighted the album&#x27;s emotional restraint, commenting that it plays less like a statement of &quot;raw emotion&quot; and more like a &quot;diary&quot; of Collins&#x27; &quot;disappointments, hopes and fantasies&quot;. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Hugh Fielder said that it effectively captured Collins&#x27; &quot;multi-faceted&quot; musicality with songs ranging &quot;from funky beat to melancholic ballads with occasional pop and avant garde twinges.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Allan Jones considered &quot;Face Value&quot; a compelling stylistic divergence from Collins&#x27; work in Genesis, writing that the album &quot;delights in confounding the familiar parameters&quot; of the band&#x27;s music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Steve Pond was more reserved in his praise. He complimented Collins for forgoing Genesis&#x27; &quot;high-blown conceits&quot; for a simpler sound rooted in &quot;basic pop and R&amp;B&quot;, but found that &quot;[his] broken heart is too clearly on his sleeve, and musical missteps abound&quot;. Pond nonetheless deemed it &quot;unmistakably the most worthy Genesis product&quot; since Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1977 debut album.

In 2000, &quot;Face Value&quot; was voted number 329 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra described &quot;Face Value&quot; as &quot;Collins&#x27; most honest, most compelling work&quot;, which &quot;stands as his masterpiece and one of the finest moments of the &#x27;80s musical landscape.&quot; Writing for &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; in 2013, Will Levith called it a &quot;now-classic&quot; album, highlighting in particular &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, &quot;which just about everybody has played air drums to one time or another&quot;, but added, &quot;The project&#x27;s most forgettable moment, however, is the closing track – an absolutely atrocious cover of &#x27;Tomorrow Never Knows&#x27; [...] Why Collins thought it was necessary to lay such a giant turd on an otherwise awesome album is beyond us.&quot;

Reviewing the album&#x27;s 2016 reissue, &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Sharon O&#x27;Connell said that &quot;Face Value&quot; established Collins as a &quot;premier-league&quot; pop and soft rock performer, &quot;nursing only a slight prog hangover&quot;, and &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Paul Elliott wrote that it remained Collins&#x27; best solo record, noting its deeply personal core themes. &quot;Dorset Echo&quot; writer Joanna Davis said, &quot;Most of the tracks stand the test of time, but some, like &#x27;If Leaving Me is Easy&#x27;, belong in the forgotten land of 80s ballads preceded by a saxophone introduction.&quot; Dorian Lynskey of &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterised the album in 2016 as &quot;an intriguing debut, wandering between art-rock and soulful MOR... &quot;Face Value&quot;&#x27;s most potent quality was its emotional transparency. Like the pensive portrait on the cover, the songs addressed the listener with unflinching directness.&quot;

<doc id="860664" wikidata="Q1653425" url="?curid=860664" title="IEC 60309">
<text>IEC 60309 (formerly IEC 309 and [[IECEE|CEE 17]], also published by CENELEC as EN 60309) is a series of international standards from the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for &quot;plugs, socket-outlets and couplers for industrial purposes&quot;. They are also referred to as &quot;pin &amp; sleeve&quot; connectors in North America or as &quot;CeeForm&quot; connectors in the entertainment industry. The maximum voltage allowed by the standard is DC or AC; the maximum current, ; and the maximum frequency, . The ambient temperature range is to .

There is a range of plugs and sockets of different sizes with differing numbers of pins, depending on the current supplied and number of phases accommodated. Connectors generally are specified by the voltage and current ratings, general configuration (number of pins), and rotational alignment (&quot;keying&quot;). The fittings are popular in open-air conditions, as the connectors have a minimum IP44 weather-proofing rating. They are also sometimes used in situations where their special capabilities (such as high current rating or three-phase facilities) are not needed, to discourage potential users from connecting domestic appliances to the sockets, as &#x27;normal&#x27; domestic plugs will not fit.

The cable connectors and sockets are keyed and colour-coded, according to the voltage range and frequency used; common colours for 50–60 Hz AC power are yellow for 100–130 volts, blue for 200–250 volts, and red for 380–480 volts. The blue fittings are often used for providing weather-proofed exterior sockets for outdoor apparatus. In camping situations, the large 32 A blue fittings provide power to static caravans, whilst the smaller blue 16 A version powers touring caravans and tents. The yellow fittings are used to provide transformer isolated 110 V supplies for UK construction sites to reduce the risk of electric shock, and this use spills over into uses of power tools outside of the construction site environment. The red three-phase versions are used for three-phase portable equipment.

==Standardization==

;IEC 60309-1: &quot;Plugs, socket-outlets and couplers for industrial purposes&quot; specifies general functional and safety requirements.
;IEC 60309-2: &quot;Dimensional interchangeability requirements for pin and contact-tube accessories&quot; applies to plugs and socket-outlets, cable couplers and appliance couplers with pins and contact tubes of standardized configurations.
;IEC 60309-3: &quot;Particular requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, connectors and appliance inlets for use in explosive gas atmospheres&quot;. This standard was withdrawn in 1998.
;IEC 60309-4: &quot;Switched socket-outlets and connectors with or without interlock&quot; applies to self-contained products that combine within a single enclosure, a socket-outlet or connector according to IEC 60309-1 or IEC 60309-2 and a switching device, with a rated operating voltage not exceeding 1000 VDC or VAC and 500 Hz, and a rated current not exceeding 800 A.
;IEC 60309-5: &quot;Dimensional compatibility and interchangeability requirements for plugs, socket-outlets, ship connectors and ship inlets for low-voltage shore connection systems (LVSC)&quot; applies to a single type of plug, socket-outlet, ship connector and ship inlet, intended to connect ships to dedicated shore supply systems described in IEC/IEEE 80005–3.

The standardization was originally done by the CEE (), which became IECEE in 1985 (International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment) and is now part of the IEC. (This is the same body that produced the &quot;CEE 7&quot; series of domestic AC plugs.) The industrial sockets were standardized in the 1960s in the CEE 17 series that was adopted in the UK as BS 4343, and which are now the IEC 60309 standard.

==Preferred current ratings and wire gauges==
The standard includes preferred current ratings and wire gauges for both International (deemed Series I) and North American (deemed Series II) applications.

Series I preferred current ratings (in amps) are: 16, 32, 63, 125, 250, 400, 630 and 800, with wire gauges specified as mm.

Series II preferred current ratings (in amps) are: 20, 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, 350, 500 and 600, with wire gauges specified as AWG and circular mil.

==Environmental protection==

IEC 60309-2 connectors come in IP44 (splash-proof), IP67 (waterproof) and IP66/IP67 (jet-proof/waterproof) variants. In all cases, the rating applies when detached or mated, but not during the mating process.

The more common IP44 variant features a spring-loaded hinged cap over the socket. When a plug is inserted, the cap hooks over a lug on the plug and retains it in place. Fixed connectors are usually installed angled downward to prevent water entering.

The IP67 and IP66/IP67 variants include a gasket and a twist-lock ring which seals the two connectors together.

==Dimensions==
Plugs have cylindrical connector pins arranged in a circle, with the earth pin larger in diameter than the other pins (used for line/neutral). This is surrounded by a circular shroud on the male connector, which fits into a matching recess on the female connector.

The standard defines connectors with 3, 4 and 5 pins, but a non-standard variant with 7 pins (6 in a circle plus one in the centre) is commercially available; this can be used for star-delta starting of three-phase motors.

===Pilot contact===

Connectors rated at 63 A and 125 A may optionally be equipped with a 6 mm pilot contact. This smaller pin in the centre of the connector is shorter than the others, designed to &#x27;make&#x27; after all the other pins when connecting a plug and socket, and to &#x27;break&#x27; first when disconnecting. It is used to switch off the load. This is useful as disconnecting under load will cause arcing which may cause damage to both the plug and socket, and risk injury to the user.

The pilot pin is located in the centre of main contact circle on 4- and 5-pin connectors. On 3-pin (2P+E) connectors, it is located on the contact circle opposite the ground pin. The other connectors are located 105° on either side of the earth pin, rather than 120° as in the smaller variants, to make room for the pilot pin.

===Extra-low voltage variant===
The standard specifies an additional, different design for extra-low voltages up to 50 VAC and currents of 16 or 32 A. This resembles, but is larger than, the IEC 60906 DC connector.
On the male plug, three 6 mm pins each 20.5 mm long are equally spaced around a 15.4 mm diameter circle, starting at the 12-o&#x27;clock position. They are surrounded by a 23 mm long shroud with an inner diameter of 36 mm and an outer diameter of 42 mm. The pin opposite the major key is optional and may be omitted to make a 2-pin variant. The inner surface of the male plug shroud is flattened at the 6-o&#x27;clock position. One or two grooves are cut in the male plug shroud to mate with corresponding keys in the female socket. There is a required major groove at the 6-o&#x27;clock position and an optional minor groove at the 12-o&#x27;clock position.

On the female socket, the major key is 4 mm deep at the 6-o&#x27;clock position. The width of the major key defines the current rating: 32 A plugs have a narrower 5 mm wide groove, while 16 A plugs have a wider 8 mm groove, and therefore 32 A plugs can be used with 16 A sockets but 16 A plugs cannot be used with 32 A sockets. The optional minor keyway is the same dimension for both current ratings: 4 mm wide at the 12-o&#x27;clock position, which mates with an additional 5 mm wide groove cut through the shroud.

==Colour code==
The colour of the housing indicates the type of power available. The primary distinction is by rated operating voltage, as follows:

==Keying==

In addition to the colour code, connectors are keyed in one of 12 positions to ensure that incompatible utilization voltages cannot be connected. Different voltage and frequency combinations are distinguished by the location of the earth pin (or a plastic projection called the &quot;minor keyway&quot;, for connectors with no earth pin), as shown in the following table. The earth pin can be in one of twelve locations, described by clock positions 1h through 12h, spaced at 30° intervals around the circle on which all the pins lie. The various positions are referenced from the view of the open side of a socket; the 6 o&#x27;clock (6h, 180°) position is at the same angle as the &quot;major keyway&quot;, and is oriented downwards. The major keyway is a projection on the plug shroud which aligns with a notch on the socket. The earth pin has a larger diameter than the other pins, preventing the wrong type of plug being inserted in a socket.
The extra-low voltage connector also supports keying, although in this case the angle is the position of the minor key, assuming the major key is at the 6h position (180°). Minor key positions 5h, 6h and 7h are unavailable, as they would overlap with the major key, but an unkeyed variant exists.
;Notes

==Common plugs==

===Red 3P+N+E, 6h ===
The red 3P+N+E, 6h (180°) plug allows connecting to the widespread 400 V three phase power network. The most common ratings are 16 A, 32 A and 63 A, with 125 A less common. Construction sites in central Europe have most of their higher power cabling setup with this &quot;three phase socket&quot; type as the single phase to neutral voltage of 230 V is available for other devices. So called power splitters with this connector as a 3 phase inlet and 3 groups of single phase outputs with individual circuit breakers are generally used to achieve this, and allow load balancing across the phases, important on generator supplies. Similar configurations are used for outdoor exhibitions, festivals and large events.

When looking at the mating face of the socket, the phase sequence should be L1, L2, L3, and then the neutral pin, proceeding clockwise from the earth pin. (Counter-clockwise on the corresponding plug.) Since some wiring may be reversed, which would make motors turn backward, many machines on construction sites feature a phase swap plug that allows the L2 and L3 phase pins to be swapped, thereby reversing the phase sequence.

Three-phase electric motors do not need the neutral wire to function, so that there is also a red four pin variant (3 phases and earth) of the IEC 60309 plugs for three phase power. The two styles are not intermatable, to prevent a potential floating neutral.

===Blue P+N+E, 6h ===

The blue P+N+E, 6h (180°) plug is a single phase connector. In particular the smallest (16 A) weather-resistant variant has become especially common in camping vehicles and sockets found in RV parks and marinas throughout Europe. The so-called &#x27;Caravan Mains Socket&#x27; has almost universally replaced a wide variety of other national 230 V domestic plugs, since it is pan-European and inherently safe to standard IP44. On larger temporary buildings, particularly with electric heating, the larger 32 A is more common.

The pins are specified to be in the order earth, phase, and neutral, clockwise when looking at the socket. Not all installations distinguish the line (phase) and neutral conductors, and reverse wired sockets are not uncommon, so double pole breaking RCDs and main switches are recommended. When sockets are mounted looking downwards then the connector system is rated for outdoor use in all weather. This is also the standard connector for lighting equipment (up to 16 A) used in the British film and television industry (often as outlets from a power splitter with a higher rated 3 phase input).

===Yellow P+N+E, 4h ===
The yellow P+N+E, 4h (120°) plug is a single phase connector that is in widespread use on the British Isles for 110 V building site and fairground applications. A popular model of this socket type is marketed under the brand name MK Commando which leads some users to refer to all IEC 60309 sockets by the generic trademark &quot;Commando sockets&quot;.

===Blue 3P+N+E, 9h ===
The blue 3P+N+E, 9h (270°) plug is a three phase connector available in areas with both 115 V and 230 V supply systems (mains). It is prevalent in the outdoor event lighting and audio power industry as an outdoor-safe replacement for NEMA connectors. In the United States it is not usually used for three phase power but for the high leg delta wiring of split-phase electric power (unknown in Europe). This allows one to choose single-phase AC power at either 110–120 volts between phase and neutral or 220–240 volts between phase and phase. Since these two modes do not need three phases there is also a dark yellow-orange four-pin connector available designed for a single-phase 110–120 or 220–240 volt load.

It is best to connect the high leg adjacent to the earth pin, so that it will not be misplaced by phase-swap plugs.

==Switched-socket outlets with interlocks==
Switched-socket outlets with interlocks are described in IEC 60309-4 standard and are commonly used to enhance electrical safety in industrial plants. The interlock cuts power to the socket when nothing&#x27;s plugged in and locks any plug in the socket until the power is turned off.

<text>Microcar is a French microcar manufacturer. The company was founded in 1980 as a division of Jeanneau, a major sailboat manufacturer. Production moved to a new custom-built factory in September 2000. In September 2008, Microcar was acquired by Ligier Automobiles in a deal backed by the Italian private equity firm 21 Investimenti Partners. The merger created Europe&#x27;s second-biggest manufacturer of microcars, and largest maker of quadricycles, or &quot;sans permis&quot; (license-exempt) vehicles. The Microcar and Ligier brands are to retain their separate identities and production facilities. Phillipe Ligier, son of company founder Guy Ligier, is CEO of the expanded Ligier Automobiles.

== Current models ==

The current model range consists of the M.GO-3, introduced (in 2015?) to replace M.Go model introduced in 2009. There are six trim levels, all with petrol engines, in the UK. The M.Go was available in conventional, diesel-engined S, S PACK, MICA, SXI, and Sport trim levels, as well as full electric.

Prior to the M.Go, Microcar was known for their long-running MC Series models, sold as the MC1 and MC2. Both where available as a 2-seat, or 4-seat long wheel base version. The long wheel base being 40mm longer than the short Virgo models. The company also sold a small commercial vehicle called the Sherpa, which was a badge-engineered Ligier X-Pro. The Sherpa was discontinued after the Ligier merger, and the MC has been dropped in favor of the new M.Go. The M.Go was only produced with a petrol engine for the UK market.

== Former models ==
* Microcar Family Luxe
* Microcar Lyra
* Microcar ALCO
* Microcar NewStreet, NewStreet Cabriolet
* Microcar Pratic Luxe
* Microcar Virgo
* Microcar Virgo 2
* Microcar Virgo 3
* Microcar Virgo Luxe

== Electric vehicles ==
From 1994 Alco electric was built.
From 2006 to 2010, the long-wheelbase version of Microcar&#x27;s MC Series was used as the basis for the ZENN EV assembled in Canada by ZENN Motor Company with an electric drivetrain. It was marketed in the U.S. and Canada under the ZENN brand as a &quot;Neighborhood Electric Vehicle&quot;(NEV), with its top speed governed to . Microcar began distributing the ZENN in Europe during 2007 under its own brand, as the Microcar ZENN. ZENN Motor purchased engineless, rolling chassis from Microcar and installed their own electric motor and drivetrain. The ZENNs retailed for $16,900 while actual cost was $65,000. Microcar brought electric vehicle production fully in-house with the M.Go Electric in 2009, and ZENN ceased production of its MC-based vehicle in 2010.

<doc id="860669" wikidata="Q2123540" url="?curid=860669" title="Spray (duo)">
<text>Spray is a synth-pop duo from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England, consisting of siblings Jenny McLaren and Ricardo Autobahn. Following the demise of their previous band, the Cuban Boys (famous for their Hampster Dance record and John Peel sessions), McLaren and Autobahn released the album &quot;Living In Neon&quot; on Ninthwave Records in the United States. This was followed in 2003 by the extended single &quot;I Am Gothic&quot;. A new album, &quot;Children of a Laser God&quot; was released online in 2006, along with the single &quot;Run With Us&quot;, a cover of the theme tune of the popular 1980&#x27;s cartoon &quot;The Raccoons&quot; with the &quot;Michael Trenfield&quot; remix as the main single accompanied with the original version and remixes from JKZ, Absorb, FMU and Diskowarp.

After a hiatus, the duo returned in 2010 with the single &quot;Everything&#x27;s Better With Muppets&quot;, accompanied by a popular YouTube video containing excerpts from The Muppet Show lipsynching with the song.

Amongst other projects, Spray have been partially responsible for Glen Campbell&#x27;s 2002 return to the top of the charts with the &quot;Rhinestone Cowboy&quot; remake, top 40 kids band the Barndance Boys, and the European hit &quot;The Woah Song&quot; by DJ Daz (Daz Sampson). McLaren has a successful sideline in vocalising club/dance records, and Autobahn in soundtracks and commercials. The band has also had one of their singles, &quot;I Am Gothic&quot;, appear in the Xbox game Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3.

Spray&#x27;s 2016 release, &quot;Enforced Fun&quot;, released on the Banoffeesound label, featured narration on its opening track &quot;The Prologue&quot; by actress and singer Jane Badler and collaborations on other tracks with artists like Kid Kasio and Hyperbubble. A version available by electronic download through Bandcamp included instrumental versions of the tracks and a bumper sticker. Their fourth album &quot;Failure Is Inevitable&quot; was released in May 2019 on Analogue Trash.

The average annual rainfall is 2242 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.2 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tateyama was remarkably stable for several decades but has declined in recent years.
==History==
The area of present-day Tateyama was part of ancient Etchū Province. The village of Tatayama was created on May 12, 1894. It was elevated to town status on January 10, 1954.

Until about the end of the Edo period, the Gohyakkoku region was called Takaharano. It originates from a time when village government officials asked the Kaga clan for permission to reclaim an open area of wild fields that was worth five hundred kokudaka, or gohyaku-kokudaka. Development went underway, and permission was granted for the formation of a town in the area. Around the area of Gohyakkoku Tenman Shrine, traffic from north to south formed between Toyama Bay and Mt. Tateyama. from there, they would intersect with streets that ran east to west from the town to central Toyama City. This set the scene for growing areas of agriculture and businesses.

==Education==
Tateyama has seven public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the village government. There is one public high school operated by the Toyama Board of Education.

The elementary schools are: Tateyama Elementary School, Kamagafuchi Elementary School, Takano Elementary School, Tateyama Chuo Elementary School, Rita Elementary School, Hokubu Elementary School, and Nichuano Elementary School. The middle school and high school are both named Oyama, for the shrines on Tateyama mountain.

Until 2016, there was an eighth elementary school called Shinseto Elementary, but it has since been closed due to a low number of attendees as a result of migration away from the mountainous area and towards the center of the main town.

Tateyama Town&#x27;s Oyama Junior High School has been reported by Education Departments to have some of the highest English abilities in Toyama Prefecture.

==Mascot==
Tateyama&#x27;s town mascot is Raijii, combining the &quot;rai&quot; from &quot;raicho&quot; (Toyama Prefecture&#x27;s bird found on Mt. Tateyama, the ptarmigan) with &quot;jii&quot; (lit. &quot;old man&quot;). He is said to be 20,005 years old, and his birthday is April 16. He carries a walking stick and his hat is in the shape of the three mountains that make up Tateyama. His job is to patrol Tateyama and protect the beautiful nature found there.

<text>Spatial planning mediates between the respective claims on space of the state, market, and community. In so doing, three different mechanisms of involving stakeholders, integrating sectoral policies and promoting development projects mark the three schools of transformative strategy formulation, innovation action and performance in spatial planning 

Spatial planning systems refer to the methods and approaches used by the public and private sector to influence the distribution of people and activities in spaces of various scales. Spatial planning can be defined as the coordination of practices and policies affecting spatial organization. Spatial planning is synonymous with the practices of urban planning in the United States but at larger scales and the term is often used in reference to planning efforts in European countries. Discrete professional disciplines which involve spatial planning include land use, urban, regional, transport and environmental planning. Other related areas are also important, including economic and community planning, as well as maritime spatial planning. Spatial planning takes place on local, regional, national and inter-national levels and often results in the creation of a spatial plan.

An early definition of spatial planning comes from the European Regional/Spatial Planning Charter (often called the &#x27;Torremolinos Charter&#x27;), adopted in 1983 by the European Conference of Ministers responsible for Regional Planning (CEMAT): &quot;&quot;Regional/spatial planning gives geographical expression to the economic, social, cultural and ecological policies of society. It is at the same time a scientific discipline, an administrative technique and a policy developed as an interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach directed towards a balanced regional development and the physical organisation of space according to an overall strategy&quot;.&quot;

Numerous planning systems exist around the world. The form of planning largely diverges and co-evolves with societies and their governance systems. Every country, and states within those countries, have a unique planning systems that is made up by different actors, different planning perspectives and a particular institutional framework. Perspectives, actors and institutions change over time, influencing both the form and the impact of spatial planning. Especially in Northwestern Europe spatial planning has evolved greatly since the late 1950s. Until the 1990s, the term ‘spatial’ was used primarily to refer to the way that planning should deal with more than simply zoning, land use planning, or the design of the physical form of cities or regions, but also should address the more complex issues of the spatial relationship of activities such as employment, homes and leisure uses.

== Spatial planning systems in Europe ==

Various compendia of spatial planning systems can be found. Below is a table showing some of the main sources, the countries covered and the date of publication.


==European spatial planning==

In 1999, a document called the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) was signed by the ministers responsible for regional planning in the EU member states. Although the ESDP has no binding status, and the European Union has no formal authority for spatial planning, the ESDP has influenced spatial planning policy in European regions and member states, and placed the coordination of EU sectoral policies on the political agenda.

At the European level, the term territorial cohesion is becoming more widely used and is for example mentioned in the draft EU Treaty (Constitution) as a shared competency of the European Union; it is also included in the Treaty of Lisbon. The term was defined in a &quot;scoping document&quot; in Rotterdam in late 2004 and is being elaborated further using empirical data from the ESPON programme in a document entitled &quot;The Territorial State and Perspectives of the European Union&quot;. At the minister&#x27;s conference in May 2007 in Leipzig, a political document called the &quot;Territorial Agenda&quot; was signed to continue the process begun in Rotterdam, revised in May 2011 in Gödöllő.

<text>Yuri Borisovich Norstein (; born 15 September 1941) is a Soviet and Russian animator best known for his animated shorts &quot;Hedgehog in the Fog&quot; and &quot;Tale of Tales&quot;. Since 1981, he has been working on a feature film called &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, based on the short story by Nikolai Gogol of the same name. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;he is considered by many to be not just the best animator of his era, but the best of all time&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== Childhood and early life ===
Yuri Norstein was born to a Jewish family in the village of Andreyevka, Penza Oblast, during his parents&#x27; World War II evacuation. He grew up in the Maryina Roshcha District of Moscow. After studying at an art school, Norstein initially found work at a furniture factory. Then he finished a two-year animation course and found employment at studio Soyuzmultfilm in 1961. The first film that he participated in as an animator was &quot;Who Said &quot;Meow&quot;?&quot; (1962).

=== Film career ===
After working as an animation artist in some fifty films, Norstein got the chance to direct his own. In 1968, he debuted with &quot;25th October, the First Day&quot;, sharing directorial credit with Arkadiy Tyurin. The film used the artwork of 1920s-era Soviet artists Nathan Altman and Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin.

The next film in which he had a major role was &quot;The Battle of Kerzhenets&quot; (1971), a co-production with Russian animation director Ivan Ivanov-Vano under whose direction Norstein had earlier worked on 1969&#x27;s &quot;Times of the Year&quot;.

Throughout the 1970s Norstein continued to work as an animator in many films (a more complete list can be found at IMDb), and also directed several. As the decade progressed his animation style became ever more sophisticated, looking less like flat cut-outs and more like smoothly-moving paintings or sophisticated pencil sketches. His most famous film is &quot;Tale of Tales&quot;, a non-linear, autobiographical film about growing up in the postwar Soviet world.

Norstein uses a special technique in his animation, involving multiple glass planes to give his animation a three-dimensional look. The camera is placed at the top looking down on a series of glass planes about a meter deep (one every 25–30 cm). The individual glass planes can move horizontally as well as toward and away from the camera (to give the effect of a character moving closer or further away).

For many years, he has collaborated with his wife, the artist Francheska Yarbusova, and the cinematographer Aleksandr Zhukovskiy. He met Francheska when he was studying at the Moscow Art School. She became his most loyal collaborator. Together they created the famous &quot;Hedgehog in the Fog&quot; (1975) and &quot;Tale of Tales&quot;. &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; was voted the best animated film of all time at the Animated Olympics, held during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 

Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Norstein&#x27;s animations were showered with both state and international awards. Then, in a bitter twist of irony, he was fired from Soyuzmultfilm in 1985 for working too slowly on his latest film, a (presumably) feature-length adaptation of Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Overcoat&quot;. By that time he had been working on it with his usual small team of three people for two years and had finished ten minutes.

In April 1993, Norstein and three other leading animators (Fyodor Khitruk, Andrei Khrzhanovsky, and Eduard Nazarov) founded the Animation School and Studio (SHAR Studio) in Russia. The Russian Cinema Committee is among the share-holders of the studio.

To this day, Norstein is still working on &quot;The Overcoat&quot; – his ardent perfectionism has earned him the nickname &quot;The Golden Snail&quot;. The project has met numerous financial troubles and false starts, but Norstein has said that it currently has reliable funding from several sources, both from within and outside of Russia. At least 25 minutes have been completed to date. A couple of short, low-resolution clips have been made available to the public. The first 20 minutes of the film have also toured among various exhibits of Norstein&#x27;s work in Russian museums. The full film is expected to be 65 minutes long.

=== Books ===
Norstein wrote an essay for a book by Giannalberto Bendazzi about the pinscreen animator Alexander Alexeïeff titled &quot;Alexeïeff: Itinerary of a Master&quot;.

In 2005, he released a Russian-language book titled &quot;Snow on the Grass. Fragments of a Book. Lectures about the Art of Animation&quot;, featuring a number of lectures that he gave about the art of animation. That same year, he was invited as &quot;guest animator&quot; to work on Kihachirō Kawamoto&#x27;s puppet-animated feature film, &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;.

On 10 August 2008, the full version of the book &quot;Snow on the Grass&quot; was released (the &quot;incomplete&quot; 2005 book was 248 pages). The book, which was printed in the Czech Republic and funded by Sberbank, consists of two volumes, 620 pages, and 1700 color illustrations.
The studio stopped working on &quot;The Overcoat&quot; for nearly a year while Norstein worked to release the book.

== Political views ==
Norstein has been an outspoken critic of the Russian government. He voiced his opposition to the conviction of the band Pussy Riot and voiced his concerns over the death of Sergei Magnitsky in prison after he had exposed corruption within the government. He was among 370 people in the Russian animation industry signing an open letter against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine that was published in &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; shortly after the invasion began.

<text>A track bicycle or track bike is a bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or outdoor track. Unlike road bicycles, the track bike is a fixed-gear bicycle; thus, it has only a single gear ratio and has neither a freewheel nor brakes. Tires are narrow and inflated to high pressure to reduce rolling resistance.

==History==


The first bicycle race is popularly held to have been a 1,200 meter race on the 31 May 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a wooden bicycle with iron tires. The machine is now on display at the museum in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.

The Union Cycliste Internationale was founded on 14 April 1900 by Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland to replace the International Cycling Association, which had been formed in 1892, over a row with Great Britain as well as because of other issues.

==Frame design==

A track frame is specific to its intended use, with emphasis on rigidity and lightness. Frames for sprinting seek to maximize rigidity, while those for general racing seek to reduce aerodynamic drag. The dropouts or &quot;track ends&quot; face rearwards to facilitate chain tension adjustment. A true track fork, unless aerodynamics are the primary consideration, has round-section blades for greater lateral stiffness when sprinting. The crown is sometimes drilled to give the option of mounting a front brake when the bike is used on the road.

===Rules===
The governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), sets limits on design and dimensions as well as the shape and diameter of the tubes used to construct the frame. The UCI permits special exceptions for the construction and geometry of track bikes.
A Keirin bike is a track bike for Keirin races in Japan that meets the strict system of standards of the JKA Foundation (Japan Keirin Autorace Foundation), the governing body for Keirin competitions, still popular under the abbreviation of its predecessor body - NJS (Nihon Jitensha Shinkōkai or the Japanese Bicycle Association).

===Geometry===

A track bicycle frameset typically differs from one used on the road in the following ways:
* higher bottom bracket – so the pedals are less likely to strike a steeply banked track
* shorter chainstays and overall wheelbase – befitting the tight quarters of velodrome races
* steeper seat tube angle and longer reach – trading long-term comfort for aerodynamic benefits
* steeper head tube angles and lower fork offset to achieve higher trail and lower flop – for stability at speed in close proximity to other riders

These changes represent substantial compromises compared to a typical road bike. For example, even medium-sized track frames often have substantial toe overlap with the front wheel; while not an issue for velodrome riding, it can make slow-speed turns difficult if the bike were used on the road.

===Material===
Frames are assembled from tubular elements (typically with round or elliptical cross sections), or cast in a mould for &quot;one-piece&quot; type models. The most popular materials for frame building include steel, aluminium, or titanium alloys, carbon fiber, or a combination of these materials. Carbon fiber frames are most common at the professional level.

==Gear ratio==
Track bicycles have only one drive sprocket (or cog) and one chainring, so the size ratio is relevant. A lower gear ratio allows quicker acceleration or &#x27;jump&#x27; but can limit top speed. A larger gear ratio makes sustained speed easier, important in pursuit racing, time trial and bunched races such as points or scratch events.
Without a good jump, the rider risks opponents accelerating away; without good sustained speed, the rider will be unable to keep up with a fast race. Track sprinters make a compromise by using particular gear ratios that allow them to reach race speeds at a relatively high cadence (pedalling), around 130-135 revolutions per minute (r/min).

Long-distance attempts such as the hour record sometimes use high gear combinations such as 52×12 or 55×14. Ondřej Sosenka used 54×13 with 190 mm cranks to set the 2005 record.

==Chain==
Bicycle chains used in track, fixed gear and single speed cycling come in two common roller widths (the internal width between the inner plates), which is either or . The chainring, sprocket and chain should all be the same width. Although a wider chain will work on a narrower chainring or sprocket, it is not ideal. A narrower chain will not work on a wider chainring or sprocket. Newer bicycles with derailleur gears use bushingless chains which flex, making gear changing possible. There are also bushingless chains on the market, which can be lighter or cheaper. Track bicycles, however, need increased strength rather than a lightness or a flexibility, so most of the track chains still use the full-bushing design.

==Tires==
Tubular tires are most often used in track racing and training, though advances in clincher tire design have seen them being used somewhat more often.

<text>was a district located in Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the district had an estimated population of 57,362 with a density of 747.39 persons per km2. The total area was 76.75 km2.

== Municipalities ==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of three towns, and one village:

* Daimon
* Kosugi
* Ōshima
* Shimo

;Notes:
Before the dissolution, the district was surrounded by the city of Toyama to the east, the city of Takaoka to the West and South (the city of Tonami also surrounds parts of the southern border), and the city of Shinminato to the north.

==History==
When the municipal reorganization was created in 1878, the district seat was located at the town of Takaoka (later became the city of Takaoka). When the Regional Office was placed in 1942, The Imizu Regional Office seat was located at the town of Kosugi.

<doc id="860714" wikidata="Q3234492" url="?curid=860714" title="Airline (1998 TV series)">
<text>Airline is a British fly on the wall television programme produced by LWT that showcases the daily happenings of passengers, ground workers and flight crew of Britannia Airways (series 1) and later EasyJet (from series 2).

The show was broadcast between 6 March 1998 and 19 January 2007 on ITV, was often repeated on ITV2 and aired in syndication on Sky Mix (previously known as Sky Three, Pick TV and Pick), Sky Real Lives and, as of 4 February 2019, CBS Reality. The programme&#x27;s success sparked a US version of the series, following American low-cost airline Southwest Airlines.

==Production==
EasyJet were first approached about the possibility of filming during mid-1998, after the first series with Britannia Airways (filmed at Manchester Airport in 1997) was discontinued. The first series with EasyJet was broadcast in January 1999, and the programme continued with them until it was discontinued. In 2003, it was ITV&#x27;s most popular factual programme. The programme has been sold to many countries worldwide, including New Zealand, Australia, and Japan.

Starting with the second series in 1999, the programme follows passengers and staff of EasyJet and Reed Aviation (the handling agents) including Manager: Graham Fraser; Check-in trouble-shooter: Jane Boulton; Check-in assistant: Katrina Leeder; Supervisors: Leo Jones, Brett Holland and Leanne Cheung, Dispatcher: Kevin Reardon; Captain: James McBride, Stewardess: Janey Stock and Stelios as well as many passengers. The series were originally set in Liverpool and Luton but later incorporated Belfast, Bristol and Newcastle airports. &quot;Airline&quot; was also occasionally filmed at Gatwick and Stansted airports. Tony Robinson and Veronika Hyks replaced Charlie Higson as voiceover.

The programme also follows some passengers and staff on interesting journeys and during important moments in their lives. Wedding proposals, marriages, illnesses, business trips, reunions and once-in-a-lifetime experiences have all been filmed, both happy and sad, and one 2001 episode featured exclusively on the consequences the September 11 attacks had on EasyJet&#x27;s operations at Luton. The programme also aims to educate the airline&#x27;s passengers concerning its rules and regulations—some of the highlighted issues relate to missed check-in, incorrect travel documentation, and the carriage of prohibited items.

====Staff overview====
====Series list of EasyJet staff====

==Format==
===Opening titles===
These titles have a sky background and feature a Britannia plane (series 1) or an EasyJet plane (series 2–4) before cutting to clips of the overall series. For series 5 and 6, these titles changed to using a lighter blue sky and switching to an all blue logo. For the next two series, the titles changed to using an orange sky and blue/orange logo. For the final two series, they were similar style to that used in series 5 and 6 but now with a reddish tint and features an airline in the logo.

===Opening and ending sequences===
*At the start of each series the narrator would show snippets of what was to come throughout the series. This would normally be announced with the phrase &quot;Welcome onboard another series of Airline&quot;
*At the beginning of each episode in every series, the narrator would give a quick preview of what would be shown.This would normally be announced with the phrases &quot;Coming up/Tonight on Airline&quot; or &quot;Onboard Airline tonight&quot;.
*At the end of most episodes, the narrator would provide an epilogue of what eventually happened to some of the passengers, staff, or business decisions (e.g. new plane, stock price) involved in that particular episode.
*Series 1-4 did not show what was coming up in the next episode but did feature at the end of the programme, before the credits, information of what happened to the passengers featured.
*Starting in series 5, clips of what would feature in the next episode were shown during the first 10 seconds of the credits.
*At the end of each series, the narrator would look back and highlight some of the more important things shown such as gripping stories about various members of airline staff. This would take about a minute and feature the common phrase &quot;The Summer/Winter season has come to an end&quot;.

==Airport changes==
=== Luton Airport ===
Series 1 which followed Britannia Airways has a very short scene filed at Luton Airport in the original arrivals area at the end of the final episode.

Series 2 &amp; 3 were filmed mostly in Luton&#x27;s 1985 terminal at check in zones B&amp;C (international) with occasional filming in &quot;zone A&quot; ((domestic) which was an extension built onto the existing terminal) as well as occasionally in the departure lounge. Building works of the new terminal building can be seen during series 3 and in final episodes of this series the check in desks have been renumbered.

&quot;Airline at Christmas&quot; filmed in late 1999 was to feature the new terminal as it opened with its new check in areas, shops and cafes, the new terminal is connected to the old terminal by Zone A. This episode is the only one to feature all check in areas.
By series 4 all operations have moved to the new building and in a couple of episodes, building works are seen going on to refurbish the old terminal into what was to become new duty free shops as part of departures. The former &quot;Zone A&quot; check in desks have been removed and this space later becomes an arrivals waiting area occasionally seen during series 5-9.

From series 7 the upstairs departure gates (originally 21 &amp; 22 (domestic) have been renumbered 12 &amp; 13.
By series 10 Luton has redeveloped its buildings again, departures has now moved upstairs in the new terminal. 

The original departure lounge is still in use but at the end of a very long walkway. The former &quot;zone A&quot; link has been demolished and replaced by a new building for a bigger arrivals waiting area and the 1985 terminal is now arrivals.

: – Area not used for Passenger operation at the time

=== Liverpool Airport ===
Series two introduces Liverpool airport as small with everything on one storey. Opposite the entrance are sales/ticket desks to the right are check-in desks and then security and departures are at the end of the concourse. 

Series two reveals the end check in desks have been removed and there is now an upstairs which provides access to the departure lounge which has also moved upstairs. The EasyJet sales desk is not seen until briefly in series 4 where staff are wearing orange uniforms.

From series 5 the sales desks is where most of the filming takes place, the staff are now mainly wearing Reed Aviation uniforms and the check in desks have been replaced with blue similar to what used to be at Luton. This continued into series six where the original entrance becomes covered over and during this series all business is moved into the new terminal and the airport becomes known as &quot;Liverpool John Lennon&quot; The official opening of this terminal is featured in the final episode of series 6.

<text>The Ethical Slut is a self-help book about non-monogamy written by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy. In the book, Easton and Hardy discuss non-monogamy as a concept and a practice, and explore sexual practices and common challenges in non-monogamous relationships.

The book was first published in 1997 by Greenery Press, which Hardy founded, under the title The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities. Hardy used the pseudonym &quot;Catherine A. Liszt&quot; for the first edition. Revised and updated editions were published in 2009 and 2017, with updated subtitles.

&quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; is widely read by non-monogamous and polyamorous people. More than 200,000 copies have been sold, and the book has been analyzed and reviewed in an academic context.

== Background ==
In 1969, Dossie Easton left a traumatic relationship and gave birth to a daughter. Easton joined a queer community in San Francisco, where she taught sex education classes and workshops for the San Francisco Sex Organization beginning with a class on &quot;unlearning jealousy&quot; in 1973. She was a founding member of the Society of Janus, a BDSM group in San Francisco, and is also a psychotherapist. In 1988, Janet Hardy left a 13-year marriage, having decided she wanted to be non-monogamous. In 1991, she founded Greenery Press, a publisher focused on &quot;adult sexuality&quot;. Easton and Hardy met in 1992 through the Society of Janus, where Easton was teaching a class on &quot;Pain Play with Canes&quot; and Hardy volunteered to help with a demonstration; the two began a relationship as co-authors as well as friends and lovers. Both women identify as queer and polyamorous.

In 1994, Hardy had influenza leading to bronchitis, and watched &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; while she was bedridden. At one point in the movie, an attractive billionaire offers a married couple one million dollars in exchange for one night with the woman in the relationship. Hardy was shocked by the couple&#x27;s hesitation. The experience led her to realize her alienation from &quot;mainstream sexual ethics&quot;, and she contacted Hardy; the two began working on a book about non-monogamy. The authors drew on their own experiences while writing the book. Easton wanted to reappropriate the word &quot;slut&quot;.

&quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; was the third book Easton and Hardy wrote together; their first two, &quot;The Topping Book&quot; and &quot;The Bottoming Book&quot;, focused on kink and reached a relatively small readership. Their other works include &quot;When Someone You Love is Kinky&quot;, &quot;The New Bottoming Book&quot;, &quot;The New Topping Book&quot;, and &quot;Radical Ecstasy&quot;.

== Publication ==
&quot;The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities&quot; was written by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy, the latter using the pseudonym &quot;Catherine A. Liszt&quot; for the first edition. It was published in 1997 by Greenery Press.

A second edition, titled &quot;The Ethical Slut. A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships and Other Adventures&quot;, was published in 2009. Promotional blurbs were provided by Deborah Anapol, Betty Dodson, Stan Dale, and Ryam Nearing.

A third edition was published on August 15, 2017 by Ten Speed Press. The third edition used the title &quot;The Ethical Slut, Third Edition: A Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Freedoms in Sex and Love.&quot; The republication marked the 20th anniversary of the book. It was updated to address cultural and technological developments including gender variance and dating apps, as well as biographical information about early polyamorous people and Black polyamorous activism.

&quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; was translated into Spanish by Miguel Vagalume, a member of Golfxs con Principios, a Spanish group named after the book and focused on &quot;non-conventional sex&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

&quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; is a self-help book intended as a guide to non-monogamy. It is divided into four sections. Each section includes exercises to help the reader explore relevant concepts. The book is written in casual language, intended to make it accessible and to avoid medicalizing or othering.

=== &quot;Welcome&quot; ===
The first section of the book, titled &quot;Welcome&quot;, is an overview of non-monogamy as a concept. In this section, Easton and Hardy define a &quot;slut&quot; as &quot;a person of any gender who has the courage to lead life according to the radical proposition that sex is nice and pleasure is good for you&quot;, and encourage the reader to embrace and explore their desires. They state that an &quot;ethical slut&quot; must care for and communicate with their partner or partners, regardless of the degree of commitment in any given relationship, and discuss other relevant values and ethics. They also note that non-monogamy is not a new phenomenon.

=== &quot;The Practice of Sluthood&quot; ===
The second section, titled &quot;The Practice of Sluthood&quot;, argues against thinking of intimacy and love as scarce resources in a &quot;starvation economy&quot;. The authors suggest that this mindset is the cause of fear and possessiveness in relationships. They also discuss boundaries and jealousy.

=== &quot;Navigating Challenges&quot; ===
The third section is titled &quot;Navigating Challenges&quot;. In this section, Easton and Hardy discuss strategies for dealing with jealousy and insecurity as well as conflict resolution. They additionally describe difficulties non-monogamous people may have with the government, including legal and health issues as well as parenting.

=== &quot;Sluts in Love&quot; ===
The fourth and final section, &quot;Sluts in Love&quot;, focuses on sexual practices in non-monogamy. Topics include swinging and open relationships, the status of single people in non-monogamy, and group sex. The authors also advocate that people should be clear about their desires during sex and discuss methods of finding sexual and relationship partners.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; has become a widely used resource for non-monogamous and polyamorous people, sometimes referred to as &quot;the poly bible&quot;. , more than 200,000 copies had been sold since the book was first published in 1997. In 2018, Hardy told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that non-monogamy was rapidly becoming more accepted among young people.

=== In academia ===
A 2001 analysis of sexual politics in &quot;Continuum&quot; described &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; as operating &quot;within an entirely different paradigm&quot; compared to common sexual liberation efforts of the 1980s, which had focused on the pursuit of &quot;scientific knowledge&quot; to support their arguments. Instead, the author argued that Easton and Hardy incorporated &quot;a major shift or relocation of subjective sexual ‘truth’ from fixed sexual identities to fluid, changeable sexual practices&quot;. He suggested that this view aligned &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; with Michel Foucault&#x27;s assertion that the goal of sexual liberation should be to &quot;use one’s sexuality henceforth to arrive at a multiplicity of relationships&quot; rather than &quot;discover in oneself the truth of one’s sex&quot;.

In the &quot;Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality&quot;, a reviewer found &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; &quot;the best book on relationships that I have ever read&quot;. 

Various reviews and discussions have compared &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; to books by Deborah Anapol, including &quot;Love Without Limits&quot; and &quot;Polyamory in the 21st Century.&quot; A book review in the &quot;Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy&quot; described &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; and &quot;Love Without Limits&quot; as &quot;twin cornerstones of modern consensual nonmonogamy&quot; and characterized them as opposite ends of a spectrum of non-monogamy. According to the review, Anapol generally focused on &quot;intimate, long-term relationships&quot; within polyamory in contrast with &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot;&#x27;s focus on &quot;more open relational style and free sexuality&quot;. Easton has described &quot;Love Without Limits&quot; as &quot;a perfectly good book - if a bit more conservative than ours&quot;.

A review in the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot; analyzed &quot;Love Without Limits&quot; and &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; alongside &quot;Loving More&quot; by Ryam Nearing. The author praised all three books&#x27; balanced discussion of &quot;Paradigms, Principles and Practicalities&quot;, and stated that the authors of all three were &quot;aware that their experiences are not universal&quot;.

In 2023, Andrea Waling wrote about &quot;The Ethical Slut&quot; in &quot;The Conversation&quot;. Waling praised the book&#x27;s advocacy of &quot;developing genuine, consensual connections through communication and honesty&quot;. She criticized the description of the &quot;starvation economy&quot; as merely conceptual, noting that people can and do withhold affection in their relationships. She argued that Easton and Hardy present monogamy in an unduly negative way, and also critiqued &quot;universal assumptions about people’s experiences&quot; including the authors&#x27; approach to dealing with emotions and their characterization of compersion.

<text>The Kontek HVDC is a long, monopolar 400 kV high-voltage direct current cable between Germany and the Danish island Zealand. Its name comes from &quot;continent&quot; and the name of the former Danish power transmission company &quot;Elkraft&quot;, which operated the power grid on the Danish islands Lolland, Falster and Zealand and had the abbreviation &quot;ek&quot;. As of today, the cable is operated by Energinet.dk in Denmark and 50Hertz Transmission GmbH in Germany.

Kontek is remarkable because, in contrast to similar facilities like Baltic Cable and Konti-Skan, all land sections of the onshore lines on Falster, Zealand and Germany are implemented as underground cable. This unusual measure, which raised the construction costs of Kontek significantly, was made for practical rather than technical reasons. Obtaining permission for building overhead lines can take a long time, and hence underground cables were used in order to ensure it was completed on schedule.

==Description==
The Kontek cable begins in the static inverter plant of Bentwisch in Germany. It runs to Markgrafenheide on the Baltic Sea, where a submarine cable section to the island of Falster begins. In this section, the Kontek crosses the Baltic Cable at through the use of a ramp. The Kontek reaches Falster near Gedser, and crosses the island via of underground cable. Subsequently, a submarine cable section then crosses the sea between Falster and Zealand. A land cable on Zealand follows, which ends at the static inverter station in Bjæverskov.

The Kontek capacity is 600 megawatts and was commissioned in 1995.

The high-voltage cable of the Kontek is implemented as paper-isolated oil-filled cable with two copper conductors with a cross section of 800 mm2 permanently joined in parallel. For better monitoring of the oil, the land sections of the Kontek cable are divided in sections of approx. , which are separated by oil-impermeable sockets from each other. In the proximity of these sockets - at some distance from the cable route - there are automatic stations for the monitoring of the oil pressure, the oil temperature and other operating parameters of the cable. For practical reasons, the long submarine cable section through the Baltic Sea between Germany and Denmark was implemented as a single oil-filled section without sockets. As electrode cables of the Kontek, on the German and on the Danish side, commercial plastic-isolated 17 kV-cables are used.

The static inverter station in Bjæverskov was attached to an existing substation for 400 kV/132 kV. For the construction of the static inverter plant in Bentwisch a new construction site was chosen even though only one kilometer north there is still the old 220 kV/110 kV-substation which was built in the GDR. In 2002 the static inverter station in Bentwisch was extended to a 380 kV/110 kV-substation and connected by a 110 kV-line to the old 220 kV/110 kV-substation.

A supplemental 400 MW AC connection between Germany and Zealand in 2018 and costing DKK 2.9 billion, is planned to use the Kriegers Flak offshore wind farm, enabling the wind power to be transmitted to either country as well as passing power between the countries.

<text>was a village located in Higashitonami District, Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

Historically, along with neighbouring Taira, Kami-Taira and Shirakawa-go, the four villages formed what was known as the Gokayama region. The region is renowned for a unique type of A-frame housing design. These &quot;gassho-zukuri&quot; houses traditionally had thatched roofs and were 3-4 stories high. The design helped keep snow from piling up in the heavy winter conditions.

As of 2003, Toga had an estimated population of 999 and a density of 5.63 persons per km2. The total area was 177.58 km2. However, the actual population is probably far less as many people who were registered in the village actually reside in neighboring areas.

On November 1, 2004, Toga, along with the towns of Fukuno, Inami and Jōhana, the villages of Inokuchi, Kamitaira and Taira (all from Higashitonami District), and the town of Fukumitsu (from Nishitonami District), was merged to create the city of Nanto.

Geographically, Toga is very mountainous with more than 96% of its area being forest cover.

Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In 2003, the town had an estimated population of 9,972 and a density of 380.61 persons per km2. The total area was 26.20 km2.

On November 1, 2004, Inami, along with the towns of Fukuno and Jōhana, the villages of Inokuchi, Kamitaira, Taira and Toga (all from the 12th District), and the town of Fukumitsu (from the 5th District), merged to create the city of Nanto.

==History==
Inami is most well known for its extensive wood carving district which traces its origins to the construction of the Inami Betsuin Zuisen-ji Temple in 1390. This temple, entirely made of wood and ornamented with intricate carvings has a long history of burning down only to be rebuilt in a much more extravagant fashion. The temple was most recently rebuilt during the Meiji period in 1885, and now exists as the largest wooden Pureland Buddhist temple in the Hokuriku region. It was officially designated as &quot;one of the prefecture&#x27;s important cultural assets&quot; on April 1, 1965. 

Because of its rich history, wood carving is the major trade in Inami. During the reconstruction of the temple in the mid 18th century woodcarvers from Kyoto were dispatched to help in the rebuilding process. These helpers ushered in a new era of woodcarving in Inami, and local carpenters began to produce a more varied assortment of carvings than the temple pieces they had focused on previously. Presently, the woodcarvers use over 200 different variations of chisels to complete their works. They are considered to be the most skilled woodcarvers Japan.

The sound of the Inami woodcarving district was chosen in 1996 as one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan.

Due to the enforcement of the district government, the district was founded in 1896 when the former Tonami District, occupied the southwestern Etchū Province, split into Nishitonami and Higashitonami Districts.

At the time of founding, the district covered all of the city of Tonami (but the sections of Takanami, Takasu, and Wakabayashi); the city of Nanto (but the Kamiyamada and Yamada sections from the former town of Fukumitsu); the sections of Higashiishiguro and Nishinojiri from the former town of Fukumitsu; and the sections of Nakata and Toidewaka in the city of Takaoka. The district seat was located at the town of De (now the center of the city of Tonami).

<doc id="860739" wikidata="Q6571211" url="?curid=860739" title="List of French Jews">
<text>Jews have lived in France since Roman times with a rich and complex history. In the Middle Ages, French kings expelled most of the original Ashkenazi Jewish population to Germany. Since the French Revolution (and Emancipation), Jews have been able to contribute to all aspects of French culture and society. In 1870, the Cremieux decree gave full French citizenship to North-African Jews living in the Maghreb under French colonization. During World War II, a significant number of Jews living in Metropolitan France were murdered in the Holocaust or deported to Nazi death camps by the French Vichy government. After 1945, France served as a haven for Askhenazi refugees. After the independence of Morocco, Tunisia and the end of Algerian War, an influx of immigration of Sephardi Jews saw the Jewish population triple to around 600,000, making it the largest Jewish community in Western Europe. Behind the United States and Israel, France ranks 3rd by Jewish population. In 2019, the Jewish Agency evaluated the Jewish population in France to be 450,000, not mentioning French citizens with only one Jewish parent or grandparent.

The following is a list of some prominent Jews and people of Jewish origins, among others (not all of them practice, or practiced, the Jewish religion) who were born in, or are very strongly associated with, France. The strongly secular French nationality law forbids any statistics or lists based on ethnic or religious membership.

<text>was a district located in Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

As of November 1, 2004, the district had an estimated population of 13,770 with a density of 234.34 persons per km2. The total area was 58.76 km2.

==Municipalities==

* Fukuoka

==History==
Due to the enforcement of the district government, the district was founded in 1896 when the former Tonami District, occupied the southwestern Etchū Province, split into Nishitonami and Higashitonami Districts.

The district covered all of the city of Oyabe, and the areas of Toide, Fukuoka, and Tatsuno in the city of Takaoka. The district seat was located at the town of Ishido (now the city of Oyabe).

===District Timeline===
* In 1962 - The towns of Ishido and Tochu were merged to form the city of Oyabe.

===Recent mergers===
* On November 1, 2004 - The town of Fukumitsu was merged with the towns of Fukuno, Inami and Jōhana, and the villages of Inokuchi, Kamitaira, Taira and Toga (all from Higashitonami District) to create the city of Nanto.
* On November 1, 2005 - The town of Fukuoka was merged into the expanded city of Takaoka. Therefore, Nishitonami District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

The total project cost was 2 billion SEK (US$280 million), and the link was put into operation in December 1994. With a length of , it was the second longest high voltage undersea cable on earth, until Basslink came into service in 2006.

== Route ==

The Baltic Cable is the only interconnector between the price zones Germany/Luxemburg (DE/LU) and Sweden 4 (SE4)
and starts in Germany at the converter station at Lübeck-Herrenwyk, which is on the site of a former coal-fired power station, It crosses the river Trave in a channel below the bottom of the river and then follows its course as sea cable laid at the eastern side of the river. After crossing the Priwall Peninsula the cable runs parallel to the coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, before turning north-easterly toward Sweden. At sea, it crosses the submarine cable of HVDC Kontek. This is the only crossing of two submarine HVDC cables in the Baltic Sea and one of the only few worldwide.

From the landing point at the southern coast of Sweden, the powerline transitions to an overhead line a few kilometres inland. It runs to a termination tower in Kruseberg which is attached to a 400 kV/130 kV substation of the Swedish power grid.

The anode, which is situated in the Baltic Sea, consists of 40 titanium nets each with a surface of 20 m2, which are laid on the sea bottom under plastic tubes and stones. It is connected to Kruseberg converter station with a 23-kilometre-long underground and submarine power line, which consists of two parallel-connected cables with 630 mm2 cross section.

The cathode is situated in the Baltic Sea north of Elmenhorst. It consists of a bare copper ring with a 2-kilometre diameter. It is connected to the static inverter plant in Lübeck-Herrenwyk with a 32-kilometre-long cable. The first 20 kilometres of this cable have a cross section of 1400 mm2 and the last of 800 mm2. This cable is laid in the tunnel under Trave River at a distance of 2.5 metres from the high voltage cable. The separation reduces the magnetic field, which may affect compasses of vessels in this highly frequented area. As the cable is a monopolar line, it produces much higher magnetic fields than bipolar cables with the same ratings.

== Operation ==
Because this overhead line can generate radio interference, there is a highly effective active filter system installed at the Kruseberg converter station. In the Lübeck-Herrenwyk converter station, there is no requirement for such a system, because there is no overhead powerline section on the German side.

The cable cannot be operated at the maximum transmission rating of 600 megawatts, because the 380 kV line which begins at the converter station of Lübeck-Herrenwyk ends at the Lübeck-Siems substation. This is the only 380 kV powerline in Germany which has no direct connection to the Central European 380 kV grid, which caused the Baltic Cable to have a 372 megawatt (MW) capacity instead of 600 MW. This bottleneck was solved in 2004 when an additional 220 kV line was built. However power flows on 220 kV and 110 kV lines face increased losses of the transmission.

In the area of the converter station there is also a 110 kV/220 kV sub-station, fed by two 110 kV circuits from the Lübeck-Siems sub-station. There is no transformer for coupling the 380 kV- and the 110 kV-grid in the area of the Lübeck-Herrenwyk converter station.

In 2016, the owner Statkraft started a court case against Swedish authorities in disagreements over profits from electricity trade in the cable.

In the night from April 16, 2017 to April 17, 2017 on the electrode cable on Priwall peninsula a fault occurred, which resulted in the generation of hydrogen at the fault location as it acted as cathode. The hydrogen got ignited by the generated heat and a 3 metres high flame shot off the ground. As there is no device monitoring the state of the electrode cable, no alert was made to the operators. Fire brigades were first not able to extinguish the fire, but the flame went out when the current was switched off.

== Expansion schemes ==
Of the two originally planned 380 kV lines to Lübeck (from Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant to Lübeck-Siems and from Schwerin substation to Lübeck-Herrenwyk), the 380 kV line between Krümmel and Lübeck-Siems was canceled according to speakers from E.ON AG.

There is still the option to build a 380 kV line from Lübeck to another 380 kV substation in Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg or Lower Saxony. The construction of the 380 kV link between Lübeck-Herrenwyk and Schwerin is not progressing due to opposition from ecologists.

A transmission rating of 600 MW should be possible via a new 220 kV cable and a static var compensator in Lübeck-Siems after 2005.

On September 1, 2005, Nakajō, along with the village of Kurokawa (also from Kitakanbara District), was merged to create the city of Tainai. Tainai City has a population of approximately 33,000.

Nakajo was the home of a Southern Illinois University Carbondale branch campus until late 2006, when the NSG (Niigata Sogo Gakuin) Group, which bought out the school, decided to close the program. The buildings have since become a very small school for high school and college English majors.

<doc id="860758" wikidata="Q7885607" url="?curid=860758" title="Ross Lake (Washington)">
<text>Ross Lake is a large reservoir in the North Cascade mountains of northern Washington state, United States, and southwestern British Columbia, Canada. The lake runs approximately north–south, is 23 miles (37 km) long, up to 1.5 miles (2.5 km) wide, and the full reservoir elevation is 1,604 feet above sea level (489 m).

The U.S. portion of Ross Lake is in the Ross Lake National Recreation Area. North Cascades National Park is adjacent to the west and south, while the Pasayten Wilderness is east of the lake. In British Columbia the lake is a part of Skagit Valley Provincial Park, and Manning Provincial Park is nearby to the east.

==Hydrology==

Ross Lake is formed by the impoundment of the Skagit River by Ross Dam, which is operated by Seattle City Light for hydroelectric power generation serving Seattle, Washington, and surrounding areas. After leaving Ross Lake, the Skagit River flows through two more reservoirs before running to Puget Sound.

High peaks surround Ross Lake in all directions, and include Hozomeen Mountain, Ruby Mountain, Desolation Peak, and Jack Mountain, the summit of which is over 7,000 feet above the elevation of the lake. Rivers and creeks flowing into Ross Lake include the upper Skagit River, Hozomeen Creek, Silver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, Arctic Creek, Lightning Creek, Devils Creek, Big Beaver Creek, and Ruby Creek. Most of these creeks originate from glaciers and snowfields high in the North Cascades.

==History==

Ross Dam, originally called Ruby Dam, was built in three stages between 1937 and 1949, and currently stands 540 feet (160 m) tall. A fourth stage of construction was planned for the dam; however, in 1984 Seattle City Light made an electricity-purchasing agreement with British Columbia which delayed any further expansion of the Ross Lake Dam for 80 years. The lake and dam are named after James D. Ross, the superintendent of the Seattle City Light&#x27;s Skagit River Hydroelectric Project, which built the dam.

==Recreation==
Ross Lake is a major recreation destination within the North Cascades, attracting visitors with a multitude of fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and hiking opportunities. The trout fishing, in particular, is well-renowned. Ross Dam, as well as Gorge and Diablo dams downstream, are barriers preventing salmon from travelling between Ross Lake and the Pacific Ocean; thus, Ross Lake has no anadromous fish.
Camping is allowed at a number of boat-in and hike-in campsites around the lake. Backcountry camping permits (free, first-come, first-served) are required, and may be obtained from the National Park Service in Marblemount.

The lake is also home to a floating resort called the Ross Lake Resort. Made up of a dozen cabins and 3 bunkhouses, it is situated approximately a quarter mile from the dam and rests entirely on log booms. During the winter, when lake levels shrink, the resort detaches from its shore moorings and relocates to the center of the lake. This is due to lower water levels caused by annual drawdowns of the lake for flood control of the Skagit River.

A road from the Canadian side of the lake ends just inside the US. Travelers do not have to report to an official Port of Entry (as required at the nearby Pacific Crest Trail crossing), as they must reenter Canada to leave.

==Climate==
Ross Lake has a mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;).

<text>Vajiralongkorn (born 28 July 1952) is King of Thailand since 2016. He is the tenth monarch of Thailand from the Chakri dynasty and is known as Rama X.

The only son of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) and Queen Sirikit, he was made crown prince by his father in 1972, at the age of 20. After his father&#x27;s death on 13 October 2016, he was expected to ascend to the Thai throne but asked for time to mourn before taking the throne. 
He accepted the throne on the night of 1 December 2016. His coronation took place from 4–6 May 2019. The Thai government retroactively declared his reign to have begun on 13 October 2016, upon his father&#x27;s death. Aged 64 at that time, Vajiralongkorn became the oldest Thai monarch to ascend to the throne. He is the wealthiest monarch in the world, with a net worth estimated to be between and .

==Early life and education==
Vajiralongkorn was born on 28 July 1952 at 17:45 in the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall of the Dusit Palace in Bangkok. When the crown prince was one year old, Somdet Phra Sangkharat Chao Kromma Luang Vajirananavongse, the 13th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand of the Rattanakosin Era, gave the child his first name at birth, Vajiralongkorn Boromchakrayadisorn Santatiwong Thewetthamrongsuboribal Abhikkunupakornmahitaladulyadej Bhumibolnaretwarangkun Kittisirisombunsawangwat Boromkhattiyarajakumarn.

Vajiralongkorn began his education in 1956 when he entered kindergarten at the Chitralada School in Dusit Palace. After completing Mathayom 1 (grade seven), he was sent to be educated at private schools in the United Kingdom, first at a prep school, King&#x27;s Mead, Seaford, Sussex, and then at Millfield School, in Somerset, where he completed his secondary education in July 1970. In August 1970, he attended a five-week military training course at The King&#x27;s School, in Sydney, Australia.

===University===

In 1972, the prince enrolled at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia. His education at Duntroon was divided into two parts, military training by the Australian Army and a bachelor&#x27;s degree course under the auspices of the University of New South Wales. He graduated in 1976 as a new lieutenant with a liberal arts degree.

In 1982, he completed a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in law, with second-class honors at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University.

==Heir apparent and social interest==
Vajiralongkorn was proclaimed crown prince on 28 December 1972 at 12:23 in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, making him the third crown prince of the Chakri dynasty.

===Short-term monastic life===
On 6 November 1978, at age 26, the prince was ordained as a monk at Wat Phra Kaew. As is traditional for royals, he stayed at Wat Bowonniwet Vihara for 15 days, under the monastic name &quot;Vajiralongkornno&quot;.

===Military training and career===
After completing his studies, Vajiralongkorn served as a career officer in the Royal Thai Army. He started his army career as a staff officer in the Directorate of Army Intelligence and attended the Command and General Staff College in 1977. After that he became Deputy Commander of the King Chulalongkorn&#x27;s Own Guards, the 4th Infantry Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment in 1978. In 1980 he was appointed as a Commander of the 4th Infantry Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment. In 1992 he became Commander of the Royal Security Command.

He is a military pilot qualified to fly the Northrop F-5, F-16, and the Boeing 737-400. His military role in recent years has become increasingly ceremonial. As his father grew older, Vajiralongkorn took a more prominent part in royal ceremonial and public appearances. He officially opened the 2007 Southeast Asian Games, held in Nakhon Ratchasima. The event occurred one day after the 80th birthday of his father.

===Medical and health care===
Vajiralongkorn established &quot;Crown Prince Hospitals&quot; through funds donated by the public to serve as medical and health care centers for people living in remote areas. Crown Prince Hospitals had been set up in 21 locations in 1977. These hospitals had become major community hospitals providing services of international standards to the general public in 2011.

===Agricultural development===
Also interested in agricultural development, Vajiralongkorn has accepted the &quot;Mobile Agricultural Clinic Project&quot; under his patronage. The project provides prompt services to farmers to enhance efficiency in farm production and solve farmers&#x27; problems. It provides experts in various agricultural fields who can advise farmers on plants, livestock, fisheries, and land development. He also offers suggestions on tackling agricultural problems and applying agricultural technology to increase productivity and improvement in the quality of agricultural production.

Mobile Agricultural Clinic teams can move quickly to various spots in need of help. It has worked steadily and is ready to provide technical services and transfer technology. With this project, farmers have been urged to be aware of agricultural development and new technology.

In the later years of his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej&#x27;s reign, Vajiralongkorn represented the King in presiding over the annual Royal Ploughing Ceremony, which is meaningful to Thai farmers as an early practice of phytopathology in the country. Aware of the importance of efficient agriculture for better productivity, Vajiralongkorn emphasized full-cycle agricultural activities, believing they will help improve farmers&#x27; quality of life, who are traditionally considered the backbone of the nation. Since becoming King himself Vajiralongkorn has presided over and participated in the ceremony in his own right.

In honour of his coronation the Rice Department released five new rice varieties/cultivars and the king has continued patronage of the royal rice varieties competition, the tradition of his ancestor Chulalongkorn.

===Focus on education===
Vajiralongkorn has initiated education projects to improve children&#x27;s access to quality learning and instill the concept of lifelong learning. He has special ties to the Rajabhat University system of 40 institutions of higher learning. The chairman of the Council of Rajabhat University Presidents of Thailand said that Vajiralongkorn has presided over commencement ceremonies at all Rajabhat Universities nationwide and personally handed out degrees to all Rajabhat university graduates every year since 1978. It is estimated that over the past 35 years, at least 2,100,000 degrees have been handed out by the crown prince to Rajabhat graduates. He also donates 42 million baht annually to a scholarship fund benefiting Rajabhat students.

===Sport interest===

Vajiralongkorn was once known as the &quot;Football Prince&quot; but is known for his cycling involvement. He has also shown keen interest in other sports since he was young. He learned horseback riding when he was about 11 years old and soon became a capable rider. While studying in Thailand and abroad, he played several sports with friends, including football, rugby, and rowing.

Vajiralongkorn also competed in sailing with King Bhumibol and sister Princess Ubolratana when they stayed at Klai Kangwon Palace in Hua Hin. In football, Vajiralongkorn first played as a forward and later became a center-back at Chitralada School, Millfield School in England, and the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Australia. He shares his love of the sport with his father.

===Residence===
Most of the time, Vajiralongkorn lives in Bavaria in Germany, where he has spent a significant amount of his adulthood. His son, Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, goes to school in the area. The King requested and received changes to the constitution to end the requirement that he appoint a regent when he is away from Thailand. In comparison, his father often made state visits early during his reign, but he left the country only once after the 1960s—an overnight stay in neighboring Laos. Vajiralongkorn has also received visits from Thai officials and dignitaries in Germany. According to the German foreign ministry, the Thai ambassador has been told multiple times that Germany opposes &quot;having guests in our country who run their state affairs from here.&quot; Thai officials have told Germany that Prime Minister Prayut is responsible for government matters, while the King is in Germany for personal reasons.

==Reign==
===Accession to the throne and coronation===
According to the 2007 Constitution, the cabinet instructed the president of the National Assembly to invite Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn to the throne. He became the first monarch to be born in Thailand since his great-uncle Prajadhipok died in 1935. After his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, died on 13 October 2016, Vajiralongkorn was expected to succeed to the throne of Thailand but asked for time to mourn before taking the throne. On the night of 1 December 2016, the fiftieth day after the death of Bhumibol, Regent Prem Tinsulanonda led the heads of the country&#x27;s three branches of government to an audience with Vajiralongkorn to invite him to ascend to the throne as the tenth king of the Chakri dynasty. Vajiralongkorn accepted the invitation, saying in a televised statement: &quot;I would like to accept in order to fulfill his majesty&#x27;s wishes and for the benefit of all Thais.&quot; The government retroactively declared his reign to have begun upon his father&#x27;s death, but it would not crown him formally until after the cremation of his father. The remains were then cremated on 26 October 2017. Currently, his main residence is Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, with the king having moved from Nonthaburi Palace in 2011.
Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s three-day coronation ceremonies took place from 4 to 6 May 2019. The one billion baht (US$29.8 million) coronation was anticipated to attract 150,000 people to Sanam Luang, which it did.

===The appointment of members of the privy council===

Following the resignation of the councillors to Bhumibol Adulyadej, Vajiralongkorn appointed 10 members of the Privy Council. The command was issued under Section 2 of the 2014 interim constitution, completed with Sections 12, 13 and 16 of the 2007 constitution on the king which were retained and remain in effect. The remaining seven members are Surayud Chulanont, Kasem Wattanachai, Palakorn Suwanrath, Atthaniti Disatha-amnarj, Supachai Poo-ngam, Chanchai Likhitjitta and Chalit Pukbhasuk, with three new members, Paiboon Koomchaya, Dapong Ratanasuwan, and Teerachai Nakwanich. Prem Tinsulanonda was re-appointed Privy Council president by royal command. On 13 December 2016, the King appointed two new members, Wirach Chinvinitkul and Charunthada Karnasuta. On 25 December 2016, the King appointed one more new member, Kampanart Rooddit. On 19 January 2017, Privy Councillor Chanchai Likhitjitta died at the age of 71.

===Direct political interference===

Thailand&#x27;s military-appointed parliament voted overwhelmingly in January 2017 to make amendments to the interim constitution, so as to allow amendments to the draft constitution as suggested by the new king&#x27;s office. Critics said the new constitution would give the military a powerful political say for years or decades. The 2017 Constitution of Thailand was approved in a referendum in 2016, and was endorsed by Vajiralongkorn on 6 April 2017, Chakri day, in a ceremony at the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the office of King Vajiralongkorn had asked for several changes to clauses related to royal power in the draft constitution, a rare intervention by a reigning Thai monarch. After the death of King Bhumibol, political activity was paused during a period of mourning that ended in 2017.

In February 2019, in an unprecedented move, the King&#x27;s elder sister, Ubol Ratana, announced her candidacy for the Thai prime ministership in the 2019 general election, running as a candidate of the Thaksin-allied Thai Raksa Chart Party. Later that same day, Vajiralongkorn issued a strongly worded statement, stating that her candidacy for prime minister is &quot;inappropriate... and unconstitutional&quot;. The Election Commission of Thailand then disqualified her from running for prime minister, formally putting an end to her candidacy. The Thai Raksa Chart Party was banned on 7 March 2019 by the Constitutional Court of Thailand for bringing a member of the royal family into politics and its political leaders were banned from politics for a decade.

Vajiralongkorn has direct control over the royal household and palace security agencies.

===Controversies===

Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s reign has been plagued by controversies unheard of during the reign of his predecessor. His image is affected by his reputation as a philanderer. In 2020, Thailand experienced widespread and unprecedented protests opposing his rule, which garnered significant attention both domestically and internationally.
For most of 2020, Vajiralongkorn reportedly rented out the alpine Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Garmisch-Partenkirchen for himself and his entourage during the COVID-19 pandemic. He remained there during the nationwide protests and amidst a wave of anti-monarchy sentiments in Thailand, sparking controversy in both Thailand and Germany. German foreign minister Heiko Maas has warned the King not to govern from German soil. He also mentioned that the German government will be investigating his behavior during his stay in the country.

On 26 October 2020, protesters marched to the German Embassy in Bangkok, petitioning the German government to investigate the King&#x27;s activities in Germany for the possibility that he had been exercising powers from German soil.

==Personal life==

===Public image, the media, and the law===

Vajiralongkorn is protected by one of the most strictly enforced &quot;lèse majesté&quot; laws in the world. For many years, criticism of the king, queen, crown prince, and more recently, former kings, members of the royal family, and even their pets have been strictly prohibited. Violations carry large fines and prison sentences of up to 35 years. However, Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s private life continues to be a controversial subject of discussion in Thailand, although not publicly. In the 10 January 2002 edition of the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; (FEER), an article appeared suggesting that Vajiralongkorn had business ties with then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. An immediate ban was placed on distribution of the magazine, and the Thai government, citing a threat to national security, suspended the visas of FEER&#x27;s two Thailand correspondents, Shawn Crispin and Rodney Tasker.

In 2002, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that &quot;Vajiralongkorn is held in much less esteem (than the then-king Bhumibol). Bangkok gossips like to swap tales of his lurid personal life... Besides, no successor, however worthy, can hope to equal the stature King Bhumibol has attained after 64 years on the throne.&quot; This issue of &quot;The Economist&quot; was banned in Thailand. In 2010, another issue of &quot;The Economist&quot;, also not distributed in Thailand, said that Vajiralongkorn was &quot;widely loathed and feared&quot; and &quot;unpredictable to the point of eccentricity&quot;, while the online journal &quot;Asia Sentinel&quot; said that he was &quot;regarded as erratic and virtually incapable of ruling&quot;; the journal was blocked shortly thereafter. In a leaked diplomatic cable, senior Singaporean foreign ministry official Bilahari Kausikan said that Vajiralongkorn had a gambling habit partly funded by exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

On 12 November 2009, a home video was released to WikiLeaks, showing Vajiralongkorn casually dressed and Princess Srirasmi Suwadee wearing only a G-string, all the while being attended to by several formally dressed servants, celebrating the birthday of the prince&#x27;s poodle, Air Chief Marshal Fufu. Part of this video was broadcast on the programme &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, on the Australian ABC channel on 13 April 2010, as part of a half-hour documentary critical of the royal family of Thailand.

On 19 January 2009, Harry Nicolaides, an Australian national, was sentenced to three years in prison for self-publishing a fictional book deemed to have violated &quot;lèse majesté&quot;. The offending passage alluded to rumours that &quot;if the prince fell in love with one of his minor wives and she betrayed him, she and her family would disappear with their name, familial lineage and all vestiges of their existence expunged forever&quot;. Nicolaides was later pardoned by the king. Nicolaides later stated that &quot;it&#x27;s entirely fiction from cover to cover&quot;.

In August 2011, the German judicial authorities in Munich impounded a Boeing 737 aircraft, one of two belonging to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Administrators seized the aircraft because of a 20-year-old Thai government debt owed to a now-defunct German construction corporation for the Don Mueang Tollway, that had risen to some €30 million. German authorities, representing the corporation&#x27;s interests in bankruptcy, stated the measure was a &quot;last resort&quot; in seeking repayment. The Thai government, which had not responded to German demands, called the move &quot;highly inappropriate&quot;. On 1 August, Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s office announced he would pay the deposit amounting to €20 million himself. One day later the Thai foreign minister Kasit Piromya confirmed that the Thai government would pay the deposit.

In November 2016, &quot;Manager Magazin&quot; published a report stating that the new king could be issued with an inheritance tax bill in excess of €3.5 billion. According to the report, the new King is domiciled in Bavaria where he owns two villas which makes him subject to local inheritance tax. On 16 May 2017, Thai officials warned Facebook after an online video was posted of the king wearing a crop top and with full view of his half sleeve tattoo.

===Marriages and issue===
====Soamsawali Kitiyakara====
On 3 January 1977, Vajiralongkorn married Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara (born 1957), a first cousin on his mother&#x27;s side. They had one daughter, Princess Bajrakitiyabha, born in December 1978. Vajiralongkorn started living with actress Yuvadhida Polpraserth in the late 1970s and had five children with her. Although Soamsawali had refused divorce for many years, Vajiralongkorn was finally able to sue for divorce in the Family Court in January 1993. In the court proceedings, Vajiralongkorn accused Soamsawali of being completely at fault for the failed relationship. She was not able to refute the charges due to the prohibition against &quot;lèse majesté&quot;. The divorce was finalized in July 1993.

====Sujarinee Vivacharawongse (Yuvadhida Polpraserth)====
When Vajiralongkorn was introduced to Yuvadhida Polpraserth, she was an aspiring actress. She became his steady companion and gave birth to his first son, Prince Juthavachara Mahidol, on 29 August 1979. He later had three more sons and a daughter by her. They were married at a palace ceremony in February 1994, where they were blessed by the King and the Princess Mother, but not by the Queen. After the marriage, she was allowed to change her name to Mom Sujarinee Mahidol na Ayudhaya, signifying she was a commoner married to royalty. She was also commissioned as a major in the Royal Thai Army and took part in royal ceremonies with Vajiralongkorn. In 1996, two years after the wedding, Mom Sujarinee (as she was now known) decamped to Britain with all her children, while Vajiralongkorn caused posters to be placed all around his palace accusing her of committing adultery with Anand Rotsamkhan, a 60-year-old air marshal. Later, the prince abducted the daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, whilst Sujarinee and her sons were stripped of their diplomatic passports and royal titles. Sujarinee and her sons moved to the United States, and as of 2007, she was known as Sujarinee Vivacharawongse. From his sons in America, Vajiralongkorn has three grandchildren.

====Srirasmi Suwadee====
Vajiralongkorn married for a third time on 10 February 2001, to Srirasmi Suwadee (royal name: &quot;Akharaphongpreecha&quot;), a commoner of modest background who had been in his service since 1992. The marriage was not disclosed to the public until early 2005. She gave birth to a son, Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, on 29 April 2005 and was then elevated to the rank of princess. Her son was immediately elevated to the rank of prince. In a magazine interview shortly after that, Vajiralongkorn stated his intention to settle down.

In November 2014, however, Vajiralongkorn sent a letter to the interior ministry asking for Srirasmi&#x27;s family to be stripped of the royal name &quot;Akharaphongpreecha&quot; awarded to her, following allegations of corruption against seven of her relatives. The following month, Srirasmi relinquished her royal titles and name and was officially divorced from Vajiralongkorn.

====Suthida Tidjai====
On 1 May 2019, three days before his coronation, Vajiralongkorn married Suthida Tidjai, former acting commander of Royal Thai Aide-de-Camp Department. Suthida was therefore made the queen consort of King Vajiralongkorn whose coronation took place in Bangkok on 4–6 May 2019. The marriage registration took place at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall in Bangkok, with his sister Princess Sirindhorn and President of Privy Council Prem Tinsulanonda as witnesses.

====Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi====
On 28 July 2019, Vajiralongkorn bestowed the title of &quot;Chao Khun Phra&quot; or Royal Noble Consort, and the royal name of Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, to Major General Niramon Ounprom; the occasion marked the first official naming of a secondary consort for nearly a century. Three months later, on 21 October 2019, a palace order stripped Sineenat of her title and ranks, stating that she had been disrespectful to Queen Suthida and disloyal to the king. On 2 September 2020, Sineenat&#x27;s titles were restored with a declaration that she &quot;is not tarnished&quot; and &quot;Henceforth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her military ranks or royal decorations.&quot;

<text>Konti–Skan (also known as Kontiskan) is the name of high-voltage direct-current transmission line between Denmark (DK1) and Sweden (SE3).

==Technical description==
Kontiskan is a bipolar HVDC scheme. Pole 1 (Kontiskan 1) was originally built in 1965, using mercury arc valves and was able to transmit up to 250 megawatts (MW) of power with an operating voltage of 250 kV. The original mercury arc scheme was taken out of operation and disconnected on 15 August 2006, being replaced by new equipment using thyristors with a power rating of 350 MW. Pole 2, the 1988-built Kontiskan 2, was built with thyristors from the outset and can transmit 300 MW with a voltage of 285 kV.

==Route==

On the Danish side, the converter station used as well by Konti–Skan 1 and 2 is close to Vester Hassing near Aalborg. From Vester Hassing a long overhead line with two conductors runs to the cable terminal at the Danish coast near Stensnæs. This line, which is only in the proximity of the converter station and the cable terminal equipped with a ground conductor, was originally used by the high voltage pole of Konti–Skan 1 and from Vester Hassing until a point a few kilometres south of the cable terminal by the electrode line, which turned there eastwards to the ground electrode at Soera. At implementation of Konti–Skan 2 the whole overhead electrode line was replaced by two long underground cables and the second conductor of the overhead line got the high-voltage pole of Konti–Skan 2. The long submarine cable to the Danish island of Læsø starts at Stensnæs and consists of 3 parallel cables. Each of these cables has two copper conductors with a copper cross section of 310 square millimeters. One of these cables was used by Kontiskan 1 and one is used by Kontiskan 2. From the third cable, one conductor was used by Kontiskan 1 and the other is used by Kontiskan 2. Konti–Skan crosses Læsø on a long overhead line with two conductors. Before the implementation of Konti–Skan 2 both conductors were switched parallel, today one conductor is used for the high voltage pole of Konti–Skan 1, while the other is used by that of Konti–Skan 2. Between Læsø and Sweden each high voltage pole of Konti–Skan uses a monopolar copper cable with a cross section of 1200 square millimetres.

From the Swedish coast a long overhead power line ran to the original converter station of Konti–Skan 1 near Stenkullen. On the first of this line the pylons carry the high-voltage conductors of Kontiskan 1 and 2. East of Brännemysten they carry also the conductor of the electrode line like a ground conductor on the pinnacle, but of course insulated to the structure of the pylons. It comes from the common grounding electrode of Kontiskan 1 and 2 near Risø in the Baltic Sea and runs after a submarine/underground cable section ending at a cable terminal near Brattas northwards as pole line to the high voltage pole line of Konti–Skan at Brännemysten. The Swedish converters of Kontiskan were originally situated at different places: that of Kontiskan 1 originally at Stenkullen, east of Gothenburg and that of Kontiskan 2 and the thyristor replacement of Kontiskan 1 near Lindome south of Gothenburg and south of the route of Kontiskan 1. The last of Konti–Skan 1 were installed on guyed aluminum framework pylons with an unusually low weight of only 800 kilograms. These pylons carried 2 conductors, the high-voltage pole and the electrode line of Konti–Skan 1 on insulators of equal length. The remaining parts of this power line were dismantled in 2012.

Shortly before the end of the line to Stenkullen, the line shared two pylons with the three-phase AC line from Stenkullen to Holmbokullen. Apart from the pylons at the terminal of HVDC Volgograd-Donbass at Volga-Hydroelectric Power Plant, these were the only pylons carrying AC and DC circuits.

<text>was a town located in Nakakanbara District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. On January 1, 2006, Muramatsu was merged into the expanded city of Gosen. Current mail addresses read &quot;Gosen City, Muramatsu&quot; (五泉市村松) to mark the merger.

The town existed for several centuries as a feudal domain and independent town. It was famous for its mountain (Mt. Hakusan, approximately 1000 meters tall), the Jikoji Zen Temple, the Sakurando Onsen Hot Spring, and its city park boasting several thousand cherry trees that bloom each year in April.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 20,066 and a density of 79.29 persons per km2. The total area was 253.07 km2.

==History==
The three-volume &quot;History of Muramatsu Town&quot; (村松町史) published in 1983 gives many details about its long history. One of only a few castle-towns in Niigata Prefecture, the Muramatsu Clan was ruled by the Hori Family throughout the Edo period. The feudal castle was burned down during the Boshin War in 1868. The site is now a public park housing a small museum archive as well as the town&#x27;s elaborate festival wagon, which is brought out each September during the Autumn Equinox.

In September 1945, 1800 members of the 1st and 2nd battalion, 27th regiment of US Army soldiers were housed at the Signal Corps barracks on the eastern edge of town. They stayed until that December, leaving a very positive impression on the Japanese citizens and contradicting rumors and suspicions spread by wartime propaganda. An English-language memoir of this period was published electronically in 2000 by the University of Kansas Center for East Asian Studies (Goto, 2000).

In May, 1946, a very large fire burned for more than eight hours, destroying 70% of the town (over 1000 homes), injuring fifty-nine and killing two. Much of the downtown district was destroyed and historical buildings lost (History v. II, pp. 802–806).

==Education==
Muramatsu had five elementary schools (Muramatsu, Muramatsu Higashi, Kawachi, Juuzen, and Okambara), two middle schools (Atago and Sanno), and a prefectural high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
In October 1923, the Kanbara Tetsudou (:ja:蒲原鉄道) established a railway in Muramatsu, including a new station and service north to Gosen City. The line then expanded south to Kamo City. The railway company was dissolved in 1999 and all train service in town suspended. The original wooden railway station was purchased and moved off-site to Yasuda City, where it was rebuilt as a small museum.

<doc id="860776" wikidata="Q830592" url="?curid=860776" title="Elbe Project">
<text>The Elbe Project () was the name of the first commercial, static high voltage direct current transmission system constructed in the world. The scheme was based on mercury arc valves.

Experimental installations between Wettingen and Zürich in Switzerland, and Charlottenburg and Moabit, Berlin, were demonstrated between 1933 and 1942. Contracts were signed with AEG and Siemens in 1941, and construction began of a bipolar direct current line from the Vockerode power station near Dessau on the Elbe, to Berlin-Marienfelde, in 1943. The line was designed to transmit 60 megawatts using a symmetrical bipolar operating voltage of +200 kV and −200 kV. Two single-core buried cables with aluminum conductors were used. A piece of the cable used can be seen in the Deutsches Museum, Munich.

The southern terminus was south of the Vockerode power plant. The hall built for this purpose (coordinates: 51°50&#x27;32&quot;N 12°21&#x27;26&quot;E) was later used as a workshop hall for the power plant and today houses some offices. The cable ran from Vockerode via Coswig, Straach, Boßdorf, Kropstädt, Treuenbrietzen, Beelitz, Michendorf, Saarmund and Großbeeren to the northern terminus in Berlin-Marienfelde. This was located in the area between the railway line from Berlin to Dresden, Beißlstrasse (until 1947 Wagemannstrasse), Friedrichsrodaer Strasse and Trachenbergring. The power converter hall built in this area (coordinates: 52°25&#x27;39&quot;N 13°22&#x27;13&quot;E) now serves as a sports hall. A 30 kV cable was laid from Berlin-Marienfelde to Steglitz substation (near Steglitz power plant), where the transmitted power should be fed into the power grid of Berlin.

A cable with an aluminum conductor with a cross section of 150 mm² and an outer diameter of 52 mm was used for each of the two high-voltage poles, while the earth was used as the neutral pole. For this purpose, there was close to both power converter stations a well equipped with a ground electrode. The exact location of these wells is no longer known.

The system was never put into service owing to the chaos in Germany at the end of World War II. The Soviets dismantled the system as part of war reparation payments, and reused it in building the 115 kilometre long 200 kV Moscow–Kashira monopolar high voltage direct current line with a maximum transmission rating of 30 megawatts in 1951. This transmission line is no longer operating.

<doc id="860778" wikidata="Q6960196" url="?curid=860778" title="Nakakanbara District, Niigata">
<text>was a district located in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the district had an estimated population of 20,066 with a density of 79.29 persons per km2. The total area was 253.07 km2.

==Municipalities==
Prior to its dissolution, the district consisted of only one town:

* Muramatsu
==History==
In 1878, Nakakanbara District was established.

The district started to shrink after the town of Nuttari merged with Niigata and the city continued to absorb the district. Three towns later gained city status during a 10-year period: Niitsu in 1951, Gosen in 1954 and Shirone (part of Niigata) in 1959.

===District Timeline===
* On June 1, 1959 - The town of Shirone was elevated to city status to become the city of Shirone. (3 towns, 1 village)
* On November 1, 1996 - The village of Yokogoshi was elevated to town status to become the town of Yokogoshi. (4 towns)

===Recent mergers===
* On March 21, 2005 - The towns of Kameda, Kosudo and Yokogoshi, along with the cities of Niitsu, Shirone and Toyosaka, the town of Nishikawa, and the villages of Ajikata, Iwamuro, Katahigashi, Nakanokuchi and Tsukigata (all from Nishikanbara District), were merged into the expanded city of Niigata.
* On January 1, 2006 - The town of Muramatsu was merged into the expanded city of Gosen. Nakakanbara District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

<doc id="860779" wikidata="Q1563629" url="?curid=860779" title="HVDC Gotland">
<text>The HVDC Gotland, on the Swedish east coast, was the first fully commercial static plant for high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) in the world. 

== Gotland 1 ==
The first HVDC Gotland link (Gotland 1) went into service in 1954. It could transfer 20 megawatts over a 98-kilometer-long submarine cable between Västervik on the mainland and Ygne on the island of Gotland, with a voltage of 100 kV. As a static inverter, Mercury arc valves were used. The Swedish company ASEA manufactured the connection for Vattenfall, the state-owned energy provider.

In 1970 the service was re-engineered to transmission capacity of 30 megawatts at a voltage of 150 kV by using the first thyristor module for HVDC applications.

== Gotland 2 ==
However even this capacity was not high enough and in 1983 a new monopolar link, HVDC Gotland 2 with a transmission capacity of 130 MW and a transmission voltage of 150 kV was established. It consists of a 92.9 kilometers long cable with a single copper conductor of 800 mm2 cross section, from which 92 kilometres are submarine and 0.9 kilometres underground. Beside this, HVDC Gotland 2 has a 6.6 kilometres long overhead powerline section between Västervik static inverter plant and the Swedish Coast. It has 2 Aluminium conductors each with a cross section of 910 mm2, which are installed on wooden poles - perhaps the only HVDC powerline using such poles. 

== Gotland 3 ==
In 1987 HVDC Gotland 3, a further monopolar link, with a transmission capacity of 130 MW and transmission voltage of 150 kV was installed. It consists of a 98 kilometers long cable with a single copper conductor of 800 mm2 cross section. 92 kilometres of this cable are laid in the sea and 6 kilometres underground on land.

== Structure ==
The grounding electrode of the Västervik Inverter Station is situated at Almvik on Östra Eknö, that of Ygne Inverter Station at Gravfält. Both electrodes are used for Gotland 2 and Gotland 3 and are situated in sea-water filled basins close to the sea. At Almvik there are 2 such basins, while Gravfält uses only one. The basin design of the electrodes prevents fishes from getting too close to the electrodes, which may harm them.
The Almvik electrode is connected with Västervik Inverter Station by an 18.95 kilometres long line with 4 overhead line and 3 submarine cable sections for strait crossings. The overhead line sections, which have a total length of 17 kilometres are installed on wooden poles and consist of 2 Aluminium conductors each with 910 mm2 cross section. The total length of the cable sections amounts to 1.95 kilometres and consist of 2 cables each with 1000 mm2 cross section. The connection between Ygne Inverter Station and Gravfält Electrode has a length of 12.75 kilometres. It consists of a 12 kilometres long overhead line on wooden poles, which uses 2 Aluminium conductors each with 910 mm2 cross section and a 0.75 kilometres long underground cable consisting of 2 Aluminium conductors each with 1000 mm2 cross section.

<doc id="860781" wikidata="Q6100536" url="?curid=860781" title="Iwamuro, Niigata">
<text>was a village located in Nishikanbara District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The area is famous for onsen near Yahiko mountain. Farming remains the predominant industry in the area. It is served by National Route 116 and Niigata Route 55.

On April 1, 2007, Iwamuro became part of Nishikan-ku ward (西蒲区, Nishikan-ku?) of Niigata city.

==History==
Iwamuro, which means &#x27;stone&#x27; and &#x27;room&#x27; in kanji, lies at the foot of . It was originally surrounded by lagoons and marshes before major irrigation work was undertaken in the late 19th and early 20th century. Nevertheless, people have been coming to the area since the Edo period to bathe in naturally-created geothermal waters. Currently there are more than 20 onsens which range in price from cheap (500 yen) to expensive (+20,000 yen). Iwamuro&#x27;s fame stems from its waters &#x27;perceived&#x27; healing properties. An apocryphal tale tells of a farmer&#x27;s wife who found a goose with a broken leg. She put it in a hot sulphur-smelling pool near her home. The goose&#x27;s leg got better. The farmer and his wife then became very rich by opening the first onsen in Iwamuro.

Behind Yahiko mountain lies the fishing village of . During the Meiji period copper mining flourished in the foothills north west of Maze. At its peak, 60 tons of copper were being extracted each month. Output decreased in the 1920s but in 1943, mining was temporarily revived. Work ended at the end of the war.

During the period of the Tokugawa shogunate, Maze was one of the ferry points to the banishment island of Sado. A small watch tower was sited just of north of the village. Samurai were tasked with guarding the shore and questioning all who landed from boats. South of the harbour is Maze Beach, which is popular with surfers. North of the village is the Nihonkai Maze Circuit which holds regular weekend meetings throughout the summer months, attracting sports car drivers from across Japan.

==Geography==
The sulphurous waters in Iwamuro rise from depths of up to . They have an average surface temperature of 24.3 °C and are highly saturated in mineral salts. Iwamuro lies on a fault zone between Yahiko mountain and the bedrock beneath the Niigata Plain. In 2006, due to the number of onsens in the area, additional bore holes were drilled to a depth of .

Rice farming is predominant throughout the area although there are several dairy and pig-rearing farms. As the village is on the Niigata plain, the rich soil deposited by the Shinano and Agano River make it ideal for agriculture.

==Demographics==
As of 2005, the village had an estimated population of 9,917 and a density of 274.63 persons per km2. Its total area was 36.11 km2.

On March 21, 2005, Iwamuro, along with the cities of Niitsu, Shirone and Toyosaka, the towns of Kameda, Kosudo and Yokogoshi (all from Nakakanbara District), the town of Nishikawa, and the villages of Ajikata, Katahigashi, Nakanokuchi and Tsukigata (all from Nishikanbara District), was merged into the expanded city of Niigata.

Since Iwamuro became part of there have been several changes in the area. For instance local government services have moved to Maki, Iwamuro&#x27;s farming cooperative opened a new rice storage centre centralising grain collection for the entire area In April 2008 after closing six independent silos and the fishing cooperatives of Maze and Niigata city have both merged, although the fish market and boat repair yard both remain open.

Iwamuro also has two independent sake makers both located in the heart of the old district at Iwamuro-onsen. Products are sold locally and are of a higher quality than commercially-made rice wine.
There are two elementary schools and one Junior High School within Iwamuro.

Iwamuro, as an area, incorporates more than 20 hamlets, villages and townships:
*Hiso
*Sakai
*Hashimoto
*Iwamuro-onsen
*Ishize
*Kubota
*Saragase
*Kanaike

<doc id="860782" wikidata="Q975279" url="?curid=860782" title="HVDC Volgograd–Donbass">
<text>The HVDC Volgograd–Donbass is a long bipolar ±400 kV high voltage direct current powerline used for transmitting electric power from Volga Hydroelectric Station at Volgograd in Russia to Donbas in eastern Ukraine and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

The Volgograd–Donbass system was the second HVDC scheme built in the former Soviet Union, following the Moscow–Kashira HVDC scheme which had already been shut down. The Volgograd–Donbass system can transfer a maximum power of 750 MW. When completed in 1965, its operating voltage of ±400 kV was the highest in the world, and remained so until the completion of the ±450 kV Nelson River scheme in 1977. The scheme is today in a bad state and only operated with a voltage of 100 kV. Nevertheless, it is still being modernized, as a Google Map Picture of its crossing with M-4 motorway at shows, where one can see that new pylons for the crossing of the motorway are under construction.

There are concerns over potential mercury contamination in the area near the Ukrainian terminal due to the risk of it being destroyed in the Ukrainian-Russian War. Some towers of the line north of Smile at were destroyed in the war.

== Volzhskaya converter station ==
The terminal at Volga Hydroelectric Station, Volzhskaya converter station, is situated on the dam of the power plant at . Each of the poles consist of four series connected three-phase valve bridges, which form two series connected twelve pulse bridges. Originally all valves of the scheme were mercury arc valves designed for a voltage of 100 kV and a maximum current of 938 Amperes. Unusually for valves of such high current rating, each valve used only a single anode but because the peak reverse voltage rating was quite limited, two valves were connected in series in each converter arm. The valves used oil-cooled cathode tanks and natural air-cooled anode insulators, with internal grading electrodes inside the porcelain. Each valve stood 3.5 m tall and weighed about 2 tonnes.

In 1977 one mercury arc valve group was replaced by a thyristor valve group. The converter transformers of Volzhskaya converter station are fed directly from the generators of the Volga Hydroelectric Station with 14 kV three-phase AC, whereby two parallel switched generators feed their power into one transformer. The transformers have beside the two secondary windings required for the realization of the 12 pulse valve bridges a third winding for feeding electric power in the local 220 kV grid. The station has no harmonic filters. All required reactive power is delivered from the generators of the power plant.

== Mikhailovska converter station ==
The converter station in Donbas area, the Mikhailovska converter station, is situated northeast of Pervomaisk, Luhansk Oblast at . Similarly to Volzhskaya converter station, each pole uses four series connected three-phase valve bridges, which form two series connected twelve pulse bridges. As at Volzhskaya converter station one mercury arc valve group was replaced in 1977 by a thyristor valve group. The valves of Mikhailovska converter station are connected through the converter transformers to the local 220 kV grid. Unusually, the DC line crosses the whole AC switchyard of the substation before it enters the valve hall situated at the southern side of the station. The hall is long and has a long wing pointing in south-southwesterly direction. The Mikhailovskaya converter station has three harmonic filters, each with a reactive power of 132 MVA, which are situated northerly of the AC switchyard.

== Powerline ==


The powerline to Donbas area has a length of and the entire length is overhead line.

The suspension towers have a single crossbar, carrying one conductor on a suspension insulator at each end of it.
Two types of strainers are used: lattice towers similar to the suspension towers, but equipped with strainer insulators and of stronger design and much more often pole-type towers with a central pole supported by two diagonal bars. The latter towers carry only one conductor, and there are always 2 such towers close together.

South of Solinky at , there is an unusual double pylon in the line, at which one conductor is fixed at suspension insulators, while the other is fixed with strainer insulators. The exact use of this pylon is unknown. It may carry equipment for extracting PLC-signals from the line, which may be used by Solinky 110 kV substation approximately 1 kilometres northward.

Southwest of Kamennyy between and the line is installed on portal pylons designed for 3 conductors, although the line has there as in all other sections just 2 conductors.

The conductors consist of bundles of 2 ACSR-conductors with 600 mm2 cross section. The whole line is equipped with a single ground wire. It is a single ACSR-wire with 70 mm2 cross section and fixed on the pinnacles of the pylons.

The line leaves Mikhailkovskaya converter station in north-northeast direction. Southeast of Onkhove it turns east-northeasterly. South of Prychiplivka it turns eastwards. East of Krasnyl Lyman it changes its way to east-northeast and passes Shchastia northward. North of Petrivka the line runs eastwards and then after Nyznoteple southwards in order not to cross a populated valley. Then at Teple it turns eastwards, however changes its way to east-southeast direction north of Harasmythka. The border to Russia is crossed north of Ushakovka at , but it enters Ukraine again for a very short section south of Talove at . The line runs in Russia past Krasnovka and Novotalovka until Taradinka eastwards, where it turns again toward northeast. North of Krivorzne its direction went more eastwards. In its further track, it passes between Krinychnyy and Melnichnny and runs past Krasnoschekov and Krasnoyarovka through large fields to Varlamovka. In its further track it passes south of Rusakov, south of Kalmykovsky and south of Erik. Behind Erik, its way nears Don River. Short before Don River the line turns to southeasterly in order to cross it in a right angle, The crossing itself, which is situated near Peskovatka at has a span width of . As the west bank of Don River is here a hill, there are no extraordinary tall pylons used. 
After Don Crossing it runs the remaining way to Volgograd until a point 5 kilometres east of Kuzmichi, where it meets the 500 kV AC lines to Volgograd Hydroelectric Plant nearly straight eastward. Then it turns southeasterly and south of Erzovka southward. It crosses several areas with recreational garden houses in the northern quarters of Volgograd and passes southerly an industrial complex and the 500 kV switchyard of Volga Hydroelectric Power Plant before it reaches its destination, the inverter plant of Volga Hydroelectric Plant, which is integrated in the power station. One conductor of the line ends at the Western end of the Power Station Building, while the other crosses on the pylons of the 220 kV-powerline, which starts here the building and ends on the other site of the building. This comes from the fact, that the valve groups are switched in series and each valve group is fed by its own machine.

== Electrodes and electrode lines ==
HVDC Volgograd–Donbass can be operated as a monopolar scheme with ground return, therefore two ground electrodes are installed. Both electrodes are designed as land electrodes consisting of a single steel rod with 30 millimetres diameter whereby coke backfill is used.

The electrode lines, which look like a 110 kV-powerlines with 2 conductors, use similar, but smaller pylons as the main line. In opposite to the main line, all strainers are free-standing lattice towers with a single crossbar, while the suspension towers of the electrode line are usually concrete poles with a single crossbar made of steel. Only suspension towers of extraordinary height are built as lattice towers.

The electrode of Mikhailovskaya converter station is situated north of Smile at .
It is connected with Mikhailovskaya converter station by a 32 kilometre long overhead line, which consists of two parallelized 2450 mm2 ACSR conductors.
The electrode line from Mikhailovskaya converter station follows the main line on the left side seen from Mikhailovskaya converter station until a point northeast of Zolobok at where it undercrosses the main line. After this point, it follows the main line on the other site until a point south of Krymske at where it leaves the course of the main line in southeast direction toward the electrode.

The electrode for the terminal at Volgograd is situated northwest of Kamennyy at . It is connected with it by a 24 kilometre long overhead line consisting of two parallelized 2450 mm2 ACSR conductors.

 last remaining tower at hydroelectric dam.

== Trivia ==
* HVDC Volgograd–Donbass was the first long-distance HVDC link without a submarine cable section
* HVDC Volgograd–Donbass is the only HVDC scheme in Europe implemented as overhead line in its whole length
* HVDC Volgograd–Donbass is the only long distance HVDC system operational in Russia. The experimental Moscow–Kashira scheme has been shut down and the planned ±750 kV, 2400 km Ekibastuz–Tambov scheme, which would have had the longest transmission distance and highest voltage in the world at the time, was never completed because of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

<doc id="860785" wikidata="Q1508315" url="?curid=860785" title="Titan triggerfish">
<text>The titan triggerfish, giant triggerfish or moustache triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens) is a large species of triggerfish found in lagoons and at reefs to depths of in most of the Indo-Pacific, though it is absent from Hawaii. With a length of up to , it is the largest species of triggerfish in its range (the stone triggerfish, &quot;Pseudobalistes naufragium&quot;, from the east Pacific is larger).

== Behavior ==

The titan triggerfish is diurnal and solitary. It feeds on sea urchins, molluscs, crustaceans, tube worms and coral. It often feeds by turning over rocks, stirring up sand and biting off pieces of branching coral. This is why other smaller fish species are often seen around it, as they feed on the detritus and smaller organisms that are stirred up. Titan triggerfish are one of a number of species of fish which can hunt and eat the crown-of-thorns starfish.

Titan triggerfish have been observed being aggressive to other fish who enter their territory.

== Interaction with humans ==
Though titan triggerfish are usually wary of divers and snorkelers, females can be territorial and aggressive around their nests during the reproduction season, which occurs for about a week in each month (either after the full moon or new moon, depending on the population).

The nest is placed in a flat sandy area, and is defended vigorously against any intruders. The territory around the nest is roughly cone-shaped and divers who accidentally enter it may be attacked. Divers should swim horizontally away from the nest rather than upwards which would only take them further into the territory. Although bites are not venomous, the strong teeth can inflict serious injury that may require medical attention.

The threat posture includes the triggerfish facing the intruder while holding its first dorsal spine erect. It may also roll onto its side, allowing it a better look at the intruder it perceives as threatening its nest. The titan triggerfish will not always bite, but can swim at snorkellers and divers escorting them out of their territory.

The flesh of the titan triggerfish is sometimes ciguatoxic.

<doc id="860788" wikidata="Q1563624" url="?curid=860788" title="HVDC Cross-Channel">
<text>The HVDC Cross-Channel () is the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) interconnector that has operated since 1986 under the English Channel between the continental European grid at Bonningues-lès-Calais and the British electricity grid at Sellindge. The cable is also known as IFA, and should not be confused with the new IFA-2, another interconnect with France that is three times as long but only half as powerful.

The current 2,000MW link is bi-directional and the countries can import or export depending upon market demands, mostly depending upon weather conditions and availability of renewable energy on the British Isles, and French surplus of nuclear generation or demand for electric heating. It was completed in 1986, and replaced the first cross-Channel link which was a 160MW link completed in 1961 and decommissioned in 1984.

A fire in September 2021 caused the link to be removed from service. National Grid announced that half of its capacity would be restored on 20 October 2021, with full capacity being restored by October 2023.

== 160 MW system (1961) ==
The first HVDC Cross-Channel scheme was built by ASEA and went into service in 1961, between converter stations at Lydd in England (next to Dungeness Nuclear Power Station) and Echinghen, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, in France. This scheme was equipped with mercury-arc valves, each having four anodes in parallel.

In order to keep the disturbances of the magnetic compasses of passing ships as small as possible, a bipolar cable was used. The cable had a length of and was operated symmetrically at a voltage of ±100kV and a maximum current of 800amperes. The maximum transmission power of this cable was 160megawatts (MW). The cable was built by ABB. Given that the cable was laid on the surface of the seabed it was prone to being fouled by fishing nets, causing damage. Whilst repairs were undertaken there was considerable down time on the circuit resulting in a loss of trading. Indeed, by 1984 the circuit was disconnected from the Main Transmission System.

== 2,000 MW system (1986) ==
Because the first installation did not meet increasing requirements, it was replaced in 1975–1986 by a new HVDC system with a maximum transmission rating of 2,000MW between France and the United Kingdom, for which two new converter stations were built in Sellindge, between Ashford and Folkestone in Kent, England and in Bonningues-lès-Calais (Les Mandarins station), near Calais, France. Unlike most HVDC schemes, where the two converter stations are built by the same manufacturer, the two converter stations of the 2,000MW scheme were built by different manufacturers (although both have subsequently become part of the same parent company, Alstom). The Sellindge converter station was built by GEC and the Les Mandarins converter station was built by CGE Alstom.

This HVDC-link is long in route, with between the two ends. The undersea section consists of eight long 270kV submarine cables, laid between Folkestone (UK) and Sangatte (France), arranged as two fully independent 1,000MW Bipoles, each operated at a DC voltage of ±270kV. Cables are laid in pairs in four trenches so that the magnetic fields generated by the two conductors are largely cancelled. The landside parts of the link consist of 8cables with lengths of in England, and in France.

In common with the 1961 scheme, there is no provision to permit neutral current to flow through the sea. Although each station includes an earth electrode, this is used only to provide a neutral reference, and only one of the two electrodes is connected at a given time so that there can be no current flow between them.

The system was built with solid-state semiconductor thyristor valves from the outset. Initially these were air-cooled and used analogue control systems, and in 2011 and 2012 respectively, the thyristor valves of Bipole 1 and Bipole 2 were replaced by modern water-cooled thyristor valves and digital control systems supplied by Alstom.

This system remains the world&#x27;s largest-capacity submarine cable HVDC system.

In November 2016, during Storm Angus, a ship dragging an anchor cut four of the eight cable components, reducing capacity by 50%. Repairs were completed by the end of February 2017. The equipment occasionally faults, causing capacity to drop: in a bad year, this might happen several times. To maintain grid frequency and power, the National Grid has a variety of frequency response assets, of which market batteries are the first to respond.

In September 2021, a major fire at the Sellindge converter station led to the shutdown of the link. National Grid initially announced that half of the link capacity would be restored within a fortnight, with full capacity being restored in March 2022. The shutdown came at a time of high prices and supply shortage in the UK electricity market, caused by low wind speeds and high prices for natural gas. On 15 October 2021, National Grid announced that half of the link capacity would be restored within the next few days, that 75% capacity would be available between October 2022 and May 2023, and that they hoped to restore full capacity by October 2023.

== Significance ==
Since the commissioning of the 2,000MW DC link in the 1980s, the bulk of power flow through the link has been from France to Britain. However, France imports energy as needed during the winter to meet demand, or when there is low availability of hydroelectric power.

, imports of electricity from France have historically accounted for about 5% of electricity available in the UK. Imports through the interconnector have generally been around the highest possible level, given the capacity of the link. In 2006, 97.5% of the energy transfers were made from France to UK, supplying the equivalent of 3million English homes. Prior to the 2021 fire, the link availability was around 98%, which was among the best rates in the world. The continued size and duration of the flows are open to some doubt, given the growth in demand in continental Europe for clean electricity, and increasing electricity demand within France.

<doc id="860794" wikidata="Q16813" url="?curid=860794" title="HVDC Inter-Island">
<text>The HVDC Inter-Island link is a long, 1200 MW high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system connecting the electricity networks of the North Island and South Island of New Zealand together. It is commonly referred to as the Cook Strait cable in the media and in press releases, although the link is much longer than its Cook Strait section. The link is owned and operated by state-owned transmission company Transpower New Zealand.

The HVDC link starts in the South Island at the Benmore Hydroelectric Power Station, on the Waitaki River in Canterbury and then it travels on an overhead transmission line through inland Canterbury and Marlborough to Fighting Bay in the Marlborough Sounds. From Fighting Bay, the link travels 40 km via submarine power cables underneath Cook Strait to Oteranga Bay, near Wellington, before travelling the final 37 km on overhead lines to Haywards transmission substation in Lower Hutt.

The HVDC link first became operational in April 1965 to primarily transport electricity from the generation-rich South Island to the more populous North Island. The link originally was a bipolar 600 MW link with mercury arc valves, until the original equipment was paralleled onto a single pole (Pole 1) in 1992, and a new thyristor-based pole (Pole 2) was constructed alongside it, increasing the link&#x27;s capacity to 1040 MW. The ageing Pole 1 was fully decommissioned effective 1 August 2012, and a replacement thyristor-based pole, Pole 3, was commissioned on 29 May 2013, restoring the DC link to a bipolar 1200 MW configuration.

==Rationale for the link==

The HVDC link is an important component of the transmission system in New Zealand. It connects the transmission grids of the two islands, and is used as an energy-balancing system, helping to match energy availability and demand in the two islands.

The two islands are geographically different – the South Island is 33 percent larger than the North Island in land area (151,000 km2 vs 114,000 km2), but the North Island has over three times the population of the South Island ( million vs million). As a consequence, the North Island has a substantially larger energy demand. However, the South Island uses more electricity per capita due to its cooler climate and the presence of the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which at a peak demand of 640 MW is New Zealand&#x27;s largest single electricity user. In 2011, around 37.1% of the total electricity generated was consumed in the South Island, while 62.9% was consumed in the North Island. South Island generation accounted for 40.9% of the nation&#x27;s electricity in 2011, nearly all (97%) from hydroelectricity, while the North Island generated the remaining 59.1% from a mixture of mainly hydroelectric, natural gas, and geothermal generation, plus smaller amount of coal and wind generation.

If all currently commissioned generation is available, both islands have enough generating capacity at peak times, without the connection between the two islands. However, the HVDC link provides benefits for customers in both the South Island and North Island:
* The link provides the South Island consumers with access to the North Island&#x27;s thermal generation resources that can support the South Island demand during times of low water storage levels and low inflows to South Island hydroelectric lakes.
* The link provides North Island consumers with access to the South Island&#x27;s large hydro generation resources that can support the North Island demand at times of peak load.

The link plays an important role in the New Zealand electricity market, and allows North and South Island generators to compete with each other, therefore driving wholesale electricity prices down.

The inter-island transmission system was designed as a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system, despite the cost of the conversion from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) and back again, to suit the requirements of a long transmission line and a sea crossing. The link crosses Cook Strait, between the two islands, using submarine power cables laid along the sea floor. HVDC is more suitable than AC for transmission over long distances, and particularly where submarine cable transmission is required, because it is typically more economic, and has lower energy losses, despite the high costs of the AC/DC conversion process.

==Route==

The HVDC Inter Island link starts at two converter stations located adjacent to Benmore Hydroelectric Power Station in the Waitaki Valley. Electricity is taken from the main Benmore switchyard, which interconnects the Benmore generators and rest of the South Island transmission grid, at 220 kV via tie-lines across the Benmore tailrace. The AC power is converted at the stations to ±350 kV HVDC for transmission

The HVDC transmission line crosses the Benmore power station tailrace and takes a route along the eastern side of the dam. The line continues north along the eastern shore of Lake Benmore, before turning north-east and then east to meet the Christchurch to Twizel HVAC line. Crossing State Highway 8 south of Fairlie, the line then turns northeast, passing between Fairlie and Geraldine. North of Geraldine to Oxford, the HVDC line broadly follows the Inland Scenic Route tourist highway through the inland Canterbury Plains, passing close to the towns of Methven, Sheffield and Oxford, before continuing northeast towards Waipara.

The HVDC line passes through Weka Pass into the Amuri district, travelling north through the region, west of Culverden, to Hanmer Springs. From here, the line turns north-east and travels through Molesworth Station into Marlborough and down the Awatere River valley, before turning north to meet State Highway 1 through the Dashwood and Weld Passes. The line travels east of Blenheim, meeting the eastern coast of the island at Cloudy Bay, and travelling up the coast into the Marlborough Sounds. The line turns east and then south-east around Port Underwood, before crossing to Fighting Bay on the coast, where the South Island cable terminal is located.

At this physical location, the lines connects to three undersea cables taking electricity underneath Cook Strait. , Pole 2 uses two of these cables, with the third cable unused waiting the commissioning of Pole 3. The cables initially head south out of Fighting Bay, before turning east towards the North Island, and then turning northeast towards the North Island cable terminal at Oteranga Bay.

From Oteranga Bay, the land-based North Island transmission line travels northeast through Mākara just west of Johnsonville. West of Ngaio, the electrode line from the North Island shore electrode at Te Hikowhenua, north of Mākara Beach, merges with the main transmission line towers for the final connection to the North Island converter station. The line turns eastwards around Churton Park, crossing to Horokiwi before turning north-east and passing through Belmont Regional Park to Haywards in northern Lower Hutt, the site of the North Island static inverter plant.

At Haywards, two converter stations receive HVDC power at ±350 kV, and convert it to alternating current at 220 kV AC. From here, the power from the Inter Island link flows to the main Haywards HVAC substation, where it is distributed to the Wellington urban area, or is transmitted north to the rest of the North Island grid.

==Technical description==
The New Zealand Inter-Island HVDC link is a long distance bipolar HVDC &quot;Classic&quot; transmission scheme that uses overhead lines and submarine cables to connect between the South and North Islands. It uses thyristor-based line-commutated converters at each end of the link for rectifying and inverting between AC and DC. The link includes ground electrode stations that enable the use of earth return current. This permits operation with unbalanced current between the two poles, and monopolar operation when one pole is out of service.

===Converter stations===
The converter stations for each pole, at each end of the link include:
* converter valve hall, cooling system and control building
* converter transformers
* 220 kV AC switchyard equipment and connections
* 220 kV AC harmonic filters
* 350 kV DC switchyard equipment, including DC smoothing reactor

The converter valves are twelve-pulse converters, arranged as three water-cooled quadrivalve assemblies. Both Pole 2 and Pole 3 use a design that suspends the quadrivalves from the roof of the valve hall. This provides superior seismic performance compared with a ground mounted arrangement, which is especially important in New Zealand&#x27;s highly seismic environment. 
There are three single-phase converter transformers for each converter valve (plus one spare transformer), and each transformer has two secondary windings connected to the valve.

Each converter station requires power factor correction equipment to generate reactive power for the converters and provide voltage support to the surrounding AC grid. At the Benmore converter station, reactive power is provided by the generators at Benmore Dam. At the Haywards converter station, reactive power and power factor correction is provided by eight synchronous condensers, two shunt capacitors, two shunt reactors, and one static synchronous compensator (STATCOM).

Details of the converter station equipment and ratings are given in the table below:

===Submarine cables===

The three submarine power cables installed in 1991 are each rated to carry 1430 A continuously at 350 kV operating voltage. They are constructed with a compacted multi-strand copper conductor as a central core, with mass-impregnated paper insulation surrounded by a lead sheath. Two layers of galvanised steel wire armour provides strength and mechanical protection. The outer layer of the cable is a serving made from polypropylene rope and the outer diameter is approximately 130 mm. The cables have a 30-minute overload capacity of 1600 A.

To ensure security of the link&#x27;s submarine power cables, a seven-kilometre wide Cable Protection Zone (CPZ) is enforced where the cables cross Cook Strait. Vessels are not permitted to anchor or fish in this area, and the area is routinely patrolled by sea and air. Anyone found anchoring or fishing in the area is liable for fines up to $100,000 and forfeiture of their vessel – more if a cable is subsequently damaged.

===HVDC transmission line===


The transmission line was designed and built by the New Zealand Electricity Department, and was completed in January 1965. The original construction of the line included the erection of 1623 steel lattice towers. In some South Island sections, the line reaches an altitude of 1280 metres. The longest span is 1119 m, near Port Underwood, close to the Fighting Bay cable terminal station.

The line was originally designed for operation at ±250 kV. During the DC Hybrid link project of 1989 to 1992, the transmission line was reinsulated with DC fog type porcelain insulator units, to enable operation at 350 kV. There are 15 units per insulator string in the inland parts of the route, and 33 units per insulator string in the coastal parts of the route that are exposed to salt condensation. The insulator strings in the coastal portions are around 5 m long.

The transmission line insulators support a pair of ACSR conductors on each side of the towers. The conductors are each 39.4 mm in diameter, and are spaced 432 mm apart.

The HVDC line has a continuous overhead earthwire for lightning protection, except for a 21 km section at the Haywards end, where the line is shielded by the electrode line conductors. A 13 km section of the North Island HVDC line uses an overhead earthwire containing a fibre optic core (OPGW), and a further 169 km section of OPGW is installed the South Island line.

About 20 new towers were constructed in 1992 to reroute the HVDC line north of Johnsonville to make way for new residential development. This was known as the Churton Park deviation.

Around 92.5 percent (1503) of the towers on the line in 2010 were identified as being original, with the remaining towers having been replaced due to line deviations, collapse, or corrosion.

Following the DC Hybrid Link project, the line was rated to carry 2000 amperes continuously on each pole, at an operating voltage of 350 kV HVDC.

===Earth electrode stations===
The connection between the North Island converter station and earth uses a shore electrode station located at Te Hikowhenua, approximately 25 km from Haywards. Following upgrades carried out during the DC Hybrid Link project, the electrode station is capable of carrying 2400 A continuously. Forty electrode cells are buried along an 800 m length of a stony beach. Each electrode cell consists of a high silicon-chromium iron electrode, suspended in a vertical porous concrete cylinder. The cells are surrounded by selected and graded stones and geotextile layers to allow seawater ingress, but prevent the buildup of silt. The electrode to ground resistance is 0.122 Ω.

The South Island ground electrode station is located at Bog Roy, 7.6 km from Benmore. It comprises buried electrode arms arranged in a star configuration over a site of approximately 1 km2. Each electrode arm is a 40 mm mild steel rod buried in a coke bed of around 0.26 m2 cross sectional area, in a 1.5 m deep trench. The electrode to ground resistance is 0.35 Ω.
A small transmission line carries a twin conductor electrode circuit from the Benmore converter station site to the South Island land electrode at Bog Roy, which in conjunction with the shore electrode in the North Island, allows one pole to operate using earth return when the other pole is out of service.

==Transmission faults and outages==
Like all transmission systems, the HVDC Inter-Island link is not immune to failures. The importance of the link means that an unplanned outage can have major implications for the entire New Zealand electricity system, potentially causing nationwide frequency deviation (underfrequency in the receiving island, overfrequency in the other island), electricity shortages in the receiving island, and a spike in wholesale electricity prices. The most catastrophic situation is a simultaneous bipole outage at high transfer when there is low to medium generation in the receiving island—instantaneous reserve generation and load shedding systems in the receiving island would not be able to come online fast enough to prevent the frequency dropping, resulting in cascading failure and outage of the entire receiving island.

Planned outages of the link are required occasionally to carry out maintenance that is not possible while the system is live. Maintenance outages are planned well in advance to minimise the effects – they are usually carried out in summer when national electricity demand is at its lowest, and on only one pole at a time, with the other pole remaining in operation providing half of the full two-pole capacity, using the earth electrodes providing a path for return current through the ground.

Notable faults and outages on the HVDC Inter-Island link:
* 1973 – an electrical fault occurred in the shore joint of Cable 1 at Fighting Bay.
* August 1975 – A strong wind storm caused a string of seven transmission towers to collapse and damage the line. The link took five days to repair.
* 1976 – A fault occurred at the Cable 1 undersea joint, 15.5 km from the South Island end at a depth of 120 metres. The joint was repaired in 1977.
* 1980 – Cable 3 failed at the Fighting Bay shore joint.
* 1981 – A gas leak on Cable 1 occurred at Oteranga Bay. It was repaired in the 1982/83 summer.
* 1988 – Cable 2&#x27;s Oteranga Bay end joint exploded, spilling insulating oil into the switchyard.
* 2004 – In January, three HVDC towers collapsed as a result of extreme winds, and in August the line voltage had to be reduced for long periods because of insulation flashovers caused by severe salt pollution at the cable station at Oteranga Bay. In October, a fault occurred in one of three Cook Strait cables that reduced the Pole 1 capacity from 540 MW to 386 MW. Repairs took almost six months.
* 19 June 2006 – The link experienced an unplanned outage just before the evening peak period on one of the coldest days of the year. With four North Island power stations out for service and an outage of Tauranga&#x27;s ripple load control equipment, even with the reserve Whirinaki Power Station called upon, the North Island experienced electricity shortages and Transpower subsequently declared a nationwide Grid Emergency at 5:34 pm. The link was restored shortly after the emergency was declared.
* 28 August 2008 – A transmission tower in the Marlborough Sounds was found buckled after its foundations slipped. The tower was reinforced with steel guy ropes until it could be replaced, as the link couldn&#x27;t be shut down without causing widespread power shortages in the South Island.
* 12 November 2013 – During the commissioning of the new two-pole control systems, a test to assess the control&#x27;s response to a trip on a 220 kV line out of Haywards during high north flow caused three filter banks at Benmore to trip off the grid. The HVDC controls automatically cut northbound transfer from 1000 MW to 140 MW, causing automatic underfrequency load shedding (AUFLS) systems to deploy in the North Island, and blacking out thousands of customers. A software bug was found to be the cause of the filter bank trips.
*17 August 2021 – The HVDC transmission line failed in the Weka Pass region, leading to conductors of the Pole 2 circuit falling across State Highway 7. Transpower issued a Grid Emergency Notice later in the day, advising that there was insufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet the forecast evening peak load in the North Island. Severe weather conditions delayed the repair and the return to service until 26 August.

== The original link ==
===Planning===
The initial vision for electricity transmission between the South and North Islands was developed by Bill Latta, the Chief Engineer of the State Hydroelectric Department. In 1950, he prepared a paper on the future of the North Island&#x27;s electric power supply and he drew attention to the projected growth of the load and the limited potential for more hydroelectric generation development on the North Island. Latta&#x27;s vision was to build more hydroelectric generating capacity in the South Island, where there was still significant opportunities for new schemes, and to transmit the power to the southern half of the North Island to meet the increasing demand.

In 1951, the cable manufacturing company British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Cables (BICC) advised the State Hydroelectric Department that a cable crossing of Cook Strait was possible, but difficult, since there was no precedent for installing power cables in such difficult marine conditions.

The development of high power mercury arc valve converters in the 1950s led to the development of several HVDC transmission schemes in other countries. This demonstrated that a long distance, high power HVDC transmission scheme was feasible in principle.

In 1956, the Government appointed BICC to undertake detailed investigations of the practicality and cost of a Cook Strait cable crossing. In December of that year, BICC reported that the project was &quot;thoroughly practicable&quot;.

In parallel with the technical investigations for cables underneath Cook Strait, the Minister responsible for the State Hydroelectric Department appointed a committee of key stakeholders to report on the options for power supply to New Zealand as a whole, not just the North Island. In 1957, the committee recommended that work commence on a large hydroelectric power station on the Waitaki River at Benmore, and that approval in principle should be given for linking the North and South Island&#x27;s power systems.

Recommendations were also received from the Swedish company ASEA (today part of the ABB), about the technical aspects of the HVDC converter stations.

The unique planning considerations for the overall proposal included:
* The hydroelectric generators at Benmore would need to be capable of absorbing the harmonic currents that would be created by the operation of the mercury arc converters.
* The Benmore generators were proposed to have an operating voltage of 16 kV, which was a new high for New Zealand hydroelectric generators at the time.
* The 16 kV circuit breakers required at Benmore would be state of the art.
* The mercury arc valves would be larger than any previously constructed, and would require water-cooled cathodes.
* The overhead HVDC transmission line would be one of the longest and most difficult built in New Zealand up to that time.
* The Cook Strait submarine cables would have to be specially designed for the seabed and tidal conditions, and require special armouring at the Oteranga Bay end, of a kind that had not been used before.

In 1958, BICC laid two 0.8 km trial lengths of cable off Oteranga Bay in Cook Strait to demonstrate their ability to resist the abrasion, bending and vibration caused by conditions on the seabed. These trial lengths were recovered and inspected in 1960, and by October that year, BICC reported that the trial had been successful and that the prototype cable would provide good service underneath Cook Strait.

In the period 1958 to 1960, some differing views were offered to Government about the most appropriate power developments for the country as a whole, and there were reservations about the risks involved in the planned Cook Strait cable crossing.

However, in March 1961, against a background of increasing urgency in meeting the forecast demand, the Government approved the project. A NZ£6.5 million contract was placed with ASEA for the design, manufacture, installation and commissioning of the converter plant at Benmore and Haywards, and a NZ£2.75 million contract was placed with BICC for the manufacture, delivery, laying and testing of the Cook Strait submarine cables.

===Construction===
The HVDC inter-island link was designed and built between 1961 and 1965 for the New Zealand Electricity Department. The major equipment suppliers were ASEA and British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Cables. The original Cook Strait cables were installed in 1964, from the cable laying ship &quot;Photinia&quot;.

When it was completed, the New Zealand HVDC link was the world&#x27;s longest HVDC transmission scheme, with the highest power rating, and the largest undersea power cables. 
The terminal stations at each end of HVDC link used large mercury-arc rectifiers and inverters – 1960s technology – to convert between AC and DC. The South Island converter station was established at the Benmore hydroelectric power station in the Waitaki Valley. The North Island converter station was built at Haywards in the Hutt Valley near Wellington.

The HVDC transmission line that connects Benmore and Haywards converter stations has an overall length of 610 kilometres. The overhead transmission line is supported by 1649 transmission towers and has a total route length of 570 km. The submarine cables underneath Cook Strait are 40 km long.

Until it was upgraded in 1993, the HVDC Inter-Island link had normal operating voltages of ±250 kV, and a maximum power transmission capacity of about 600 MW.

The HVDC link was originally designed to transfer power northwards from Benmore to Haywards. In 1976, the control system of the original scheme was modified to allow power to be sent in the reverse direction, from Haywards to Benmore.

===Engineering heritage status===
The original HVDC link was recognised as a significant part of New Zealand&#x27;s engineering heritage by the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand, (now Engineering New Zealand), during the &quot;Engineering to 1990&quot; project, which helped to celebrate the country&#x27;s sesquicentenary in 1990.
==The Hybrid Upgrade Project==

In 1987, the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand began investigations to find the best means of upgrading the inter-island link. A hybrid upgrade was chosen over total replacement, for economic reasons. The term &quot;hybrid&quot; was adopted because the increase in capacity was to be obtained through a combination of voltage and current upgrades. The upgrade project involved continued use of the existing mercury arc valve converter equipment alongside new solid-state thyristor converter stations. The scope of work included:
* Providing three new HVDC submarine cables underneath Cook Strait, to supplement and ultimately replace the original cables. Each new cable was rated at 350 kV, 1430 A, giving a maximum power capacity of 500 MW per cable. The three new power cables were installed in 1991 by the cable laying vessel Skagerrak.
* New cable terminal stations at Fighting Bay and Oteranga Bay
* The existing mercury arc valve converters at each end of the link were reconfigured to operate in parallel at each station (they had previously operated with opposite electrical polarity). They were redesignated as Pole 1.
* The operating voltage of the mercury arc valve converters was increased from the original 250 kV to 270 kV
* New HVDC thyristor converter stations were added at each end of the link. These had an operating voltage of 350 kV, and were designated as Pole 2.
* The reinsulating of the entire HVDC overhead transmission line to increase its rating to 350 kV. Work on transmission structures and conductors was also carried out to ensure that the line conductors could operate at up to 2000 A on each Pole.

The Pole 2 converter stations and new submarine cables were commissioned in March 1991.

The upgrade brought the total converter station capacity to 1348 MW (648+700 MW), however the link was restricted to 1240 MW due to the overhead transmission line rating&#x27;s restricting Pole 1&#x27;s operating capacity to 540 MW. After the retirement of the last of the original submarine cables, the overall HVDC link transfer capability was restricted further to 1040 MW due to the single Pole 2 cable underneath Cook Strait.

In its Asset Management Plan 2018, Transpower indicated that in the regulatory period 2020-2025 it planned significant expenditure to extend the life or replace ageing equipment in the Pole 2 converter stations that is near the end of its original 30-year design life.
==Decommissioning of Pole 1==
On 21 September 2007, the original Pole 1 mercury-arc converter stations were shut down &quot;indefinitely&quot;. However, in December 2007, Transpower announced that one-half of the capacity of Pole 1 would be returned to &quot;warm standby&quot; service before the winter of 2008 in order to meet the demand for power in the North Island if needed. The remaining half-pole equipment of Pole 1 was to be decommissioned.

Transpower also announced in November 2007 that by December 2007, it would increase the south to north power transmission capacity of Pole 2 from 500 MW to 700 MW. This was done by reconfiguring the three operational submarine cables. One of the two cables previously connected to Pole 1 was transferred to Pole 2.

On 13 March 2008, Transpower announced that work had been completed to restore 50% of the capacity of Pole 1 to service at times when the demand for power on the North Island peaked. Several mercury arc rectifiers were cannibalized from the Konti-Skan link between Denmark and Sweden for this restoration. The energy transfer on Pole 1 was strictly limited to the northbound direction, to reduce the stress and strain on the aging converter system.

In May 2009, Transpower placed the remaining capacity of Pole 1 back into service for a short period, at a limited capacity of 200 MW, in response to a temporary loss of capacity on Pole 2.

The decommissioning of half of Pole 1 and the operational restrictions placed on the remaining Pole 1 capacity led to the HVDC link operating mostly in monopolar mode, using Pole 2 alone. In 2010, Transpower reported that continuous operation in monopolar mode has caused the HVDC link to act as a galvanic cell with the earth, causing Benmore&#x27;s Bog Roy earth electrodes to erode as they acted as an anode, and causing the buildup of magnesium and calcium hydroxide deposits on Hayward&#x27;s Te Hikowhenua shore electrodes as they acted as a cathode. Additional replacement and maintenance work was required.

On 1 August 2012, Transpower decommissioned the remaining half of the Pole 1 mercury arc valve converter stations at Benmore and Haywards, after 47 years in service. The Inter Island link at the time was the last HVDC system in the world with mercury arc valve converters in operational service.

==The Pole 3 Project==
In May 2008, Transpower submitted an investment proposal to the Electricity Commission for the replacement of the old mercury arc valve Pole 1 converter stations with new thyristor converter stations. In July 2008, the Electricity Commission announced its intention to approve the project.
This project involved the construction of new converter stations designated as Pole 3, to operate at +350 kV 700 MW, matching the existing Pole 2 (−350 kV, 700 MW). Site works on the $672 million project were formally commenced on 19 April 2010, when Minister of Energy Gerry Brownlee turned the first sod. The new converter stations were to be commissioned by April 2012, but in May 2011, Transpower announced that commissioning was delayed until December 2012 because of difficulties being experienced by the manufacturer.
Work involved in replacing Pole 1 with the new Pole 3 converter stations included:
* New valve halls adjacent to the Pole 2 valve halls at both Benmore and Haywards, each containing the thyristors converters
* New transformers connecting the valve halls to the 220 kV buses at both Benmore and Haywards
* Connecting the Pole 3 thyristors to the existing Pole 1 lines at both Benmore and Haywards
* Connecting the Pole 3 thyristors to the existing electrode lines at both Benmore and Haywards
* Switching the number 5 Cook Strait cable from Pole 2 back to the Pole 1/3.
* New 220 kV filters on the 220 kV buses at both Benmore and Haywards
* New transformers connecting the four synchronous condensers C7 to C10 to the 110 kV bus at Haywards
* New 5th and 7th harmonic filters connecting to the 110 kV bus at Haywards.
* Removal of the existing converter transformers connecting the Pole 1 mercury arc valves and two of the synchronous condensers to the 110 kV bus at Haywards.
* Removal of all remaining mercury arc valve Pole 1 equipment at both Benmore and Haywards.
The decommissioning of Pole 1 was scheduled for July 2012, allowing works to switch the existing lines over Pole 3 to occur, and to allow testing of the new pole to occur during the summer months where electricity demand and therefore inter-island electricity transfer is low. The new Pole 3 was able to operate at 700 MW from commissioning, but due to inadequate voltage support at the Haywards end of the link, Pole 2 and 3 combined transfer was limited to 1000 MW. After the commissioning of a new static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) at Haywards in January 2014, Pole 3 was able to operate at its full capacity with Pole 2 in operation (1200 MW total transfer).

=== Pole 2 control system replacement ===
Pole 2 was commissioned in 1992 with HVDC control systems using late 1980s technology. After 20 years in service, the control systems are nearing the end of their useful life, are technologically obsolete, and are incompatible with the new Pole 3 control systems, making bipole control impossible.

In late 2013, Transpower took Pole 2 out of service for four weeks to allow the control systems to be replaced with new systems identical to those used in Pole 3, and to install a new bipole control system to control both poles. This was followed by three months of testing the new control systems. Pole 3 continued to operate during the outage and most of the testing in a monopolar configuration with the earth electrodes.

===Other associated works===

====Line maintenance====
During the time that Pole 1 was removed from service for replacement with Pole 3, maintenance and remedial work was undertaken on some sections of the transmission line. Work included:
* Replacing around 100 transmission towers in the South Island to fix clearance issues
* Replacing some conductor lengths in the North Island as they approach the end of their useful life
* Reinforcing some North Island transmission towers.

====Benmore generator transformers====
The original design of the inter-island link at Benmore was integrated with the design of the 540 MW Benmore hydroelectric power station. The 16 kV generator busbars in the power station were the point of connection between the HVDC link and the South Island grid. The power from the six Benmore generators could flow directly from the 16 kV busbars to the HVDC link via converter transformers, with the interconnecting transformers connecting to the Benmore 220 kV busbar to export or import electricity from the rest of the South Island. The design of the power station was optimised with the HVDC link, and the interconnecting transformers were designed with a significantly lower rating than the maximum output of the Benmore generators, because so much of the generator output power would normally flow to the HVDC link.

Following Transpower&#x27;s decommissioning of the original Pole 1 equipment, there was no longer any direct connection between the generator 16 kV busbars and the HVDC link, and the limited capacity of the Benmore interconnecting transformers would have constrained the maximum output of the station. In co-ordination with the Transpower programme for decommissioning of the Pole 1 equipment, Benmore owner Meridian Energy replaced the interconnecting transformers with new generator transformers. The six generators were reconnected to the 220 kV national grid via six new generator circuit breakers and three 220/16/16 kV three winding transformers. The new transformers each connect two generators, via two 16 kV secondary windings.
==Planned upgrades==

===Cook Strait cables===
In 2024, the Commerce Commission approved a proposal from Transpower to upgrade the capacity of the HVDC link by adding a fourth Cook Strait cable and additional reactive support at Haywards. The new investment would enable an increase in maximum HVDC capacity to 1,400MW. The upgrade was approved as a contingency, where the timing would depend upon triggers such as the exit of the aluminium smelter from Tiwai Point, developments in the load and generation forecasts, and Transpower demonstrating a net positive market benefit from the investment.

Transpower stated that the existing submarine cables would reach end-of-life in the early 2030s and would cost around $400 million to replace.

<text>Robert Alan Newton (born 10 May 1981 in Nottingham, England) is a British hurdling athlete. As of 2004, he was Britain&#x27;s number one sprint hurdler. However, competing for Team GB at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Newton failed to qualify for the second round of the 110 m hurdles competition. He was the only openly gay British Olympian that year.

After not racing at all in 2005, Newton transitioned to the 400 metre hurdles along with the 110 metre hurdles in 2006, achieving a 51.88 personal best in that event. He has no recorded races since 2006. In 2012, he worked as a sports massage therapist.

<doc id="860804" wikidata="Q2204736" url="?curid=860804" title="HVDC Italy–Corsica–Sardinia">
<text>The HVDC Italy–Corsica–Sardinia (also called SACOI; Sardinia–Corsica–Italy) is an HVDC interconnection used for the exchange of electric energy between the Italian mainland, Corsica and Sardinia. It is unusual, having more than two converter stations as part of a single HVDC system, and (as of 2012) is one of only two &quot;multi-terminal&quot; HVDC systems in operation in the world (the other multi-terminal scheme being the Quebec – New England Transmission system linking northeastern United States with Quebec in Canada). 

The scheme is a monopole using a mixture of overhead line and submarine cable for the 200 kV high voltage conductor, and sea return for the neutral current. The overhead lines and submarine cables are duplicated, with both circuits being installed on the same towers.

The scheme was constructed in three phases.

== SACOI 1 - Mercury arc system (1968) ==

=== Converter stations ===

When originally completed in 1968 by English Electric, the scheme comprised two converter stations, at San Dalmazio in Tuscany on the Italian mainland, which was situated close to a production area and offered a connection to two 220 kV lines, and Codrongianos on Sardinia. Each converter station was rated at 200 kV, 200 MW and consisted of two 6-pulse converter bridges in series. Normal operation was with both bridges in service but the scheme could be operated at 50% of rated voltage and power by bypassing one converter group at each end, to allow maintenance to be carried out.

Each 6-pulse converter bridge consisted of 6 main mercury-arc valves plus a 7th for high-speed bypass operations. Each valve was rated at 1000 A dc and had four anode columns in parallel, with air cooling used for both the anodes and cathodes of the valve.

The original scheme was commissioned during 1967 and put into commercial operation in January 1968.

The mercury arc valves were as well in San Dalmazio as in Codrongianos situated in a hall with a length of 60 metres, a width of 20 metres and a height of 15 metres. The valves are still in these halls, however the mercury was removed, after the decommissioning of the mercury arc system in 1992.

=== Transmission lines and cables ===

The scheme consists of three overhead line sections: one on the Italian mainland with a length of , one on Corsica with a length of and one on Sardinia with a length of . The overhead line sections use twin conductors (each rated at 1000 A dc) connected in parallel. Each aluminium conductor has a cross section of 628 mm2 in Sardinia and Italy, and 755 mm2 on Corsica.

In addition to this, there are two submarine cable sections: between Italy and Corsica and between Corsica and Sardinia. The conductor cross-sections are 1080 mm2 on land and 420 mm2 for the submarine lengths.

=== Sea electrodes ===

The scheme was designed to export power from coal-fired power stations on Sardinia to the Italian mainland, and thus was only required to operate in one direction. Although the converter stations are inherently capable of operating in either direction of power transmission, advantage was taken of the unidirectional power-flow requirement to economise on the design of the sea electrodes. The sea return current enters the sea at the Sardinian end (anode) and leaves the sea at the mainland end (cathode). The mainland electrode consists of bare copper (a section of insulated copper cable with the insulation stripped off), which would corrode rapidly if used as an anode but suffers no degradation when used as a cathode. However, the anode electrode on Sardinia required a more sophisticated design using platinum-coated titanium pipe, subdivided into 30 sub-electrodes, in order to prevent corrosion.

== Corsica tap (1988) ==

In 1988 a third converter station, rated at 50 MW, along with a reversible ground electrode, was installed at Lucciana on Corsica, making the scheme into a multi-terminal scheme for the first time. In order to allow power to be either imported into or exported from Corsica (even though the direction of power flow is always from Sardinia to Italy), the Lucciana converter station was equipped with high-speed changeover switchgear.

Unlike the two original converters, the Lucciana converter station was built with air-insulated, air-cooled thyristor valves, supplied by CGE Alstom

== SACOI 2 - 1992 upgrade ==

In 1992 the mercury arc converters at Codrongianos and San Dalmazio were decommissioned and two new converters stations were built, using air-cooled, air-insulated thyristor valves similar to those supplied for the connection at Lucciana. At the Sardinian end, the new converter station was built next to the existing station but at the mainland end a new converter station was built at Suvereto, as this site offered in opposite to San Dalmazio an interconnection to the 380 kV grid. At the same time, the rating of the scheme was increased to 300 MW, keeping the same voltage of 200 kV.
As well as in Suvereto as in Codrongianos, the converters are situated in halls with a length of 38 metres, a width of 15 metres and a height of 11 metres.

== SACOI 3 ==

It is planned to replace the existing scheme with a bipolar system with a transmission rate of 400 MW called SACOI 3. It will also operate with a voltage of 200 kV. While the overhead lines can be used without modification, the underground and underwater cables have to be replaced for the higher transmission rate. Two new converters will also be built at the existing sites in Suvereto and Codrongianos.

Public consultation for the project took place in 2023.

<text>Aleksandr Konstantinovich Petrov (also Alexander or Alexandre) () (born 17 July 1957 in Prechistoye, Yaroslavl Oblast) is a Russian animator and animation director.

==Biography==
Petrov was born in the village of Prechistoye (Yaroslavl Oblast) and lives in Yaroslavl. He studied art at VGIK (state institute of cinema and TV) and was a disciple of Yuriy Norshteyn at Moscow&#x27;s Advanced School for Screenwriters and Directors.

After making his first films in Russia he moved to Canada where he adapted the novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, resulting in a 20-minute animated short — the first large-format animated film ever made. Technically impressive, the film is made entirely in pastel oil paintings on glass, a technique mastered by only a handful of animators in the world. By using his fingertips instead of a paintbrush on different glass sheets positioned on multiple levels, each covered with slow-drying oil paints, he was able to add depth to his paintings. After photographing each frame painted on the glass sheets, which was four times larger than the usual A4-sized canvas, he had to slightly modify the painting for the next frame and so on. It took him over two years—from March 1997 through April 1999—to paint each of the 29,000+ frames. For the shooting of the frames a special adapted motion-control camera system was built, probably the most precise computerized animation stand ever made. On this an IMAX camera was mounted, and a video-assist camera was then attached to the IMAX camera. The film was highly acclaimed, receiving the Academy Award for Animated Short Film and Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

After this, Aleksandr Petrov has maintained a close relationship with Pascal Blais Studio in Canada, which helped fund &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, where he works on commercials. He returned to Yaroslavl in Russia to work on his latest film, &quot;My Love&quot;, which was finished in spring 2006 after three years&#x27; work and had its premiere at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival on 27 August, where it won the Audience Prize and the Special International Jury Prize. On 17 March 2007, &quot;My Love&quot; was theatrically released at the Cinema Angelika in Shibuya, (Japan) by Studio Ghibli, as the first release of the &quot;Ghibli Museum Library&quot; (theatrical and DVD releases of Western animated films in Japan).

In a 2009 interview, Petrov stated that he was jobless and using-up the last of his previously earned money. A 2010 article stated that Petrov wants to create an animated feature film with his technique, but cannot start because of lack of funds. Four years later he directed a three-minute animated sequence for the Sochi Paralympic Games called &quot;Firebird&quot; (Жар-птица). In an interview later that year, Petrov confirmed that if he can find the funding, he would like to work on a feature film in the future using his signature style, and stated that he is currently working on a film project but that it is progressing with great difficulty.

In July 2016, Petrov sat on the board of directors for the International Film Festival of Poetic Animation held in Pergola, Italy.

In July 2020, Petrov told reporters that he had started pre-production work on a 60-minute biographical film called &quot;Knyaz&quot; about Alexander Nevsky, which would be released in 2025. In March 2021 he said that the film had entered production and would be released in late 2024. Nevsky exhibited sketches for the film in 2023 and 2024.

==Artistic style==

Petrov&#x27;s style from the late 1980s onward can be characterized as a type of Romantic realism. People, animals and landscapes are painted and animated in a very realistic fashion, but there are many sections in his films where Petrov attempts to depict a character&#x27;s inner thoughts and dreams. In &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, for example, the fisherman dreams that he and the marlin are brothers swimming through the sea and the sky. In &quot;My Love&quot;, the main character&#x27;s illness is represented by showing him being buried beneath freshly fallen snow on a dark night.

<doc id="860807" wikidata="Q14874607" url="?curid=860807" title="HVDC Vancouver Island">
<text>HVDC Vancouver Island is a de-energized high-voltage direct current interconnection owned by BC Hydro that runs between Arnott Substation (ARN) in Delta, British Columbia at on the Canadian mainland, and the Vancouver Island Terminal (VIT) in Duncan, British Columbia on Vancouver Island at . It went into operation in 1968 and was extended in 1977. HVDC Vancouver Island consists of three overhead line sections with a total length of 42 kilometres and two submarine cable sections with a length of 33 kilometres. Pole 1 ceased operation in 2014, and Pole 2 ceased operation in 2016. The infrastructure remains in place and portions may be re-used in the future.

==Route==
After its departure from Arnott Substation the overhead power line on the mainland splits at into two branches, one running to the Canoe Pass Terminal at and the other running to the Tsawwassen Beach Terminal at , where the first submarine cable section begins.

At , the first submarine cable section ends and a short overhead line section running south-west across Galiano Island starts. The overhead line leaves Galiano Island south of Montague Harbour in an 880-metre-long span, which starts at and ends on Parker Island at .

A little to the west, on Parker Island at the overhead line ends and the second submarine cable section begins.
At the cable reaches Salt Spring Island and the third overhead line section starts. It crosses Salt Spring Island west-south-westerly. North of Maxwell Point at and Arbutus Point at the overhead line crosses Sansum Narrows, the strait between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island, by a 1900-metre-long span. After this span the overhead line runs westward to Vancouver Island Terminal near the town of Duncan.

==History==
In 1968 the first pole of the HVDC Vancouver Island link went into service. Its static inverters use mercury vapour rectifiers. Each of these rectifiers was long, wide and high and has a weight of 4.5 metric tons. The valves are situated in a hall long, wide and high. The maximum transmission capacity of this pole was 312 megawatts and the transmission voltage was 260 kV. The stations Vancouver Island Terminal and Arnott Substation were designed and delivered by Swedish company ASEA (later ABB). The Swedish team of some 10 people were headed for the first phase by Ivan Hedlund and for the second phase by Gunnar Ahgren.

In 1977 the HVDC Vancouver Island link was supplemented by installing a second pole. This pole used thyristor valves for its static inverters and operated at a voltage of 280 kV with a rating of 370 megawatts. A new 230 kV. submarine cable for three-phase alternating current has been constructed between the Canadian mainland and Vancouver Island. This parallels the existing two HVDC lines and replaces one of two earlier 138 kV lines. In the 2005 hearings for the new 230kV circuit the HVDC systems were reported to be at the end of their service life and are not considered to be reliable. As a result of this, the first pole was shut down in 2014 and the second in 2016.

==Electrodes and metallic return==
HVDC Vancouver Island used metallic return, during monopolar operation, when current is lower than 600 A. Otherwise earth return was used. On Vancouver Island the line for metallic return is a monopolar line on wooden poles, which are used in some sections also by AC lines, running parallel to the main line of HVDC Vancouver Island.

On the mainland, it uses the poles of the electrode line until a point at . After this point it runs on wooden poles together with a single-circuit three-phase AC line until .
From there it runs as underground cable to Splashdown Park, where it transits at again into an overhead line, which ends at the terminal of the main line at .

The electrode on the Canadian Mainland is a land electrode situated at Boundary Bay at . It is connected with Arnott Substation by an overhead pole line with two conductors. The electrode on Vancouver Island is a shore electrode in a bay at Sansum Narrows at . It is connected with Vancouver Island Terminal by an overhead line with two conductors, which is installed on wooden poles. It runs between Vancouver Island Terminal and a point northwest of Maple Bay at parallel to other power lines.

<doc id="860812" wikidata="Q2045524" url="?curid=860812" title="Pacific DC Intertie">
<text>The Pacific DC Intertie (also called Path 65) is an electric power transmission line that transmits electricity from the Pacific Northwest to the Los Angeles area using high voltage direct current (HVDC). The line capacity is 3.1 gigawatts, which is enough to serve two to three million Los Angeles households and represents almost half of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) electrical system&#x27;s peak capacity.

The intertie originates near the Columbia River at the Celilo Converter Station of Bonneville Power Administration&#x27;s grid outside The Dalles, Oregon and is connected to the Sylmar Converter Station north of Los Angeles, which is owned by five utility companies and managed by LADWP. The Intertie can transmit power in either direction, but power flows mostly from north to south.

The section of the line in Oregon is owned and operated by Bonneville Power Administration, while the line in Nevada and California is owned and operated by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The transition is at the Oregon–Nevada border, at .

This is one of two HVDC lines serving Los Angeles; the other is Path 27.

== Overview ==
The idea of sending hydroelectric power to Southern California had been proposed as early as the 1930s, but was opposed and scrapped. By 1961, US president John F. Kennedy authorized a large public works project, using new high voltage direct current technology from Sweden. The project was undertaken as a close collaboration between General Electric of the US and ASEA of Sweden. Private California power companies had opposed the project but their technical objections were rebutted by Uno Lamm of ASEA at an IEEE meeting in New York in 1963. When completed in 1970 the combined AC and DC transmission system was estimated to save consumers in Los Angeles approximately US$600,000 per day by use of cheaper electric power from dams on the Columbia River.

One advantage of direct current over AC is that DC current penetrates the entire conductor as opposed to AC current which only penetrates to the skin depth. For the same conductor size, the effective resistance is greater with AC than DC, hence more power is lost as heat with AC. In general, the total cost for HVDC is less than an AC line if the line length is over 500–600 miles, and with advances in conversion technology, this distance has been reduced considerably. A DC line is also ideal for connecting two AC systems that are not synchronized with each other. HVDC lines can help stabilize a power grid against cascading blackouts since power flow through the line is controllable.

The Pacific Intertie takes advantage of differing power demand patterns between the northwestern and southwestern US. During winter, the northern region operates electrical heating devices while the southern portion uses relatively little electricity. In summer, the north uses little electricity while the south reaches peak demand due to air conditioning usage. Any time the Intertie demand lessens, the excess is distributed elsewhere on the western power grid (states west of the Great Plains, including Colorado and New Mexico).

==Components==

The Pacific Intertie consists of:
* The Celilo Converter Station which converts three phase 60 Hz AC at 230 to 500 kV to ±500 kV DC (1000 kV pole-to-pole) at .
** The grounding system at Celilo consists of 1,067 cast iron anodes buried in a trench of petroleum coke, which behaves as an electrode, arranged in a ring of circumference at Rice Flats (near Rice, Oregon), which is SSE of Celilo. It is connected to the converter station by two aerial ACSR (aluminum conductor, steel reinforced) conductors, which end at a &quot;dead-end&quot; tower situated at .
* A overhead transmission line consisting of two steel-cored ACSR conductors, each in diameter with a conducting cross-sectional area of , carrying 500 kV.
** The two lines when combined have a capacity of 3.1 gigawatts (in bipolar mode).
* The Sylmar Converter Station () which converts DC to 230 kV AC (a process also called inverting) and is phase-synchronized with the L.A. power grid.
** The Sylmar grounding system is a line of 24 silicon-iron alloy electrodes submerged in the Pacific Ocean at Will Rogers State Beach suspended in concrete enclosures about above the ocean floor. The grounding array, which is from the converter station and is connected by a pair of ACSR conductors, which are in the sections north of Kenter Canyon Terminal Tower at installed instead of the ground conductors on the pylons. It runs from Kenter Canyon Terminal Tower, via DWP Receiving Station U (Tarzana; a former switching station), Receiving Station J (Northridge) and Rinaldi Receiving Station (also a former switching station) to Sylmar Converter Station. On the section between Receiving Stations J and Rinaldi, one of the two shielding conductors on each of two parallel-running 230 kV transmission lines is used as electrode line conductor.

==History==
The first phase of the scheme, completed in May 1970, used only mercury-arc valves in the converters. The valves were series connected in three six-pulse valve bridges for each pole. The blocking voltage of the valves was 133 kV with a maximum current of 1,800 amperes, for a transmission rating of 1,440 MW with a symmetrical voltage of 400 kV with respect to earth.

Each converter station housed six mercury arc valves groups, consisting each of seven valves, for a total of 42 valves in each converter.
The valves had a width of , a height of and a length of and weighed . Each valve contained mercury, with a weight of .

* 1972: After the Sylmar earthquake, the Sylmar Converter Station had to be reconstructed due to extensive damage.
* 1982: The power rating of the mercury arc valve rectifiers was raised by various improvements to 1,600 MW.
* 1984: The transmission voltage was pushed to 500 kV and the transmission power was increased to 2,000 MW by adding one six-pulse thyristor valve group rated at 100 kV to each pole.
* 1989: A further increase of the transmission power to 3,100 MW took place by installing a 1,100 MW parallel connected thyristor converter in Celilo and Sylmar. This upgrade started in 1985 was called the &quot;Pacific Intertie Expansion&quot;. This expanded the converter station to two sites, Sylmar West (situated at ) and Sylmar East (situated at ).
* 1993: One pole of the Pacific Intertie Expansion converter station at Sylmar was completely destroyed by fire. The converter was replaced in 1994–1995 by Siemens.
* 1994: After the Northridge earthquake, the Sylmar Converter Station had to be reconstructed due to extensive damage.
* 2004: The Sylmar East station was upgraded from 1,100 MW to 3,100 MW. The controls and older converters, including the mercury arc valves, were completely replaced by a single pair of 3,100 MW 12-pulse converters built by ABB. This allowed the Sylmar East station to handle the full capacity. In parallel with this project, the six-pulse mercury arc valves at the Celilo Converter Station were replaced with Siemens light-triggered thyristors in compliance with their Modified Age Replacement Policy (MARP).
* 2005: The Sylmar East station was rededicated as the Sylmar Converter Station.
* 2014-2015: The Celilo converter substation was upgraded in a similar manner to the Sylmar East upgrade. The North converter was upgraded from 1,100 MW to 3,100 MW. The new converter was built by the ABB. The new converter connects at 500kV AC instead of the previous 230kV AC connection. After completion, all of the equipment for the south converter was removed.

<text>ObjectStore is a commercial object database, a specialized type of NoSQL database designed to handle data created by applications that use object-oriented programming techniques, avoiding the object–relational mapping overhead required when using object-oriented data with a relational database. It is inspired by the Statice database originally developed at Symbolics.

ObjectStore is innovative in its use of the C++ language to make database access transparent. Objects can be created in a database by overloading the operator new(). In this way, one can create new C++ objects directly in the database yet these persistent objects look and behave just like normal C++ objects. Data is mapped into memory as operating system pages. When data is referenced in a different page, by making use of signals, ObjectStore traps the pointer exception and transparently brings objects in from the database by bringing in the required page(s). In addition, by use of a technique called swizzling, the database can be accessed from different platforms, with pages being &#x27;swizzled&#x27; as they are brought into memory on page faults to correct big endian versus little endian platform issues as well as virtual function table layout. The design of ObjectStore is described in a 1991 paper in the &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;.

ObjectStore was originally created in 1988 by Object Design, Incorporated, which was based in Burlington, Massachusetts and founded by several former Symbolics employees, including Daniel Weinreb. In 2002 the product was acquired by Progress Software, which continued to develop the technology, expanding its use beyond the object database market to target uses as a database for real-time computing, specifically designed for RFID data management, and as a cache for relational databases.

In 2013, Progress Software sold off many of its non-core products to Aurea Software, Inc., a newly formed operating subsidiary of ESW Capital, the investment arm of Trilogy Enterprises. As part of the deal the ObjectStore product line moved to a separate operating subsidiary of ESW Capital.
The ObjectStore product is used in many fields, including telecommunications, financial services, travel, GIS, and the government.

One of the early successful applications of the product was with Telstra to handle 13 and 1300 numbers in Australia - similar to 1800 numbers in the US. The product enabled the real time mapping of those numbers to a number closest to the caller - for example a local taxi company or the nearest open Pizza Hut.

<text>The Nelson River DC Transmission System, also known as the Manitoba Bipole, is an electric power transmission system of three high voltage, direct current lines in Manitoba, Canada, operated by Manitoba Hydro as part of the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project. It is now recorded on the list of IEEE Milestones in electrical engineering. Several records have been broken by successive phases of the project, including the largest (and last) mercury-arc valves, the highest DC transmission voltage and the first use of water-cooled thyristor valves in HVDC.

The system transfers electric power generated by several hydroelectric power stations along the Nelson River in Northern Manitoba across the wilderness to the populated areas in the south.
It includes two rectifier stations, Radisson Converter Station near Gillam at and Henday Converter Station near Sundance at , one inverter station, Dorsey Converter Station at Rosser located north west of Winnipeg at ), and two sets of high-voltage direct current transmission lines. Each HVDC transmission line has two parallel overhead conductors to carry the positive and negative feeds.

A third line, Bipole 3, was completed in 2018, running from the new Keewatinoow Converter Station along the west side of Lake Manitoba to the new Riel Converter station on the east side of Winnipeg.

There are no intermediate switching stations or taps. All three bipolar systems have extensive ground return electrodes to allow use in monopolar mode.

==History==
Construction in 1966 of the 1,272 MW Kettle Rapids generating station required a long transmission line to connect it to load centers in the southern part of Manitoba. The Government of Canada agreed to finance installation of an HVDC line to be repaid by Manitoba Hydro when the load growth permitted the utility to assume the debt due to the line. Delivery of direct current electric power began on June 17, 1972.

One unit of the Kettle generating station was completed before the direct current converters were completed. For the winter of 1970 the bipole lines were energized with alternating current, contributing a useful amount of energy to the Manitoba system; a shunt reactor was installed to prevent excess voltage rise due to the Ferranti effect.

At that time, Bipole I used the world&#x27;s highest operating voltage to deliver the largest amount of power from a remote site to a city, and employed the largest mercury arc valves ever developed for such an application. The line required construction of over 3,900 guyed towers and 96 self-supporting towers across varied terrain. Permafrost in some areas led to foundation settling of up to 3 feet (1 m).

The loan by the Government of Canada was discharged when Manitoba Hydro bought the line and outstanding debt in 1992. In 1997 a tornado damaged 19 towers of the DC lines. During repairs, some major customers were advised to curtail load, but imports over the 500 kV lines from adjacent utilities in the United States prevented serious interruption of power.

A third such line, called Bipole 3 was proposed, to run along the west side of Manitoba. On October 26, 2009, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, along with engineering and environmental experts, released an analysis which they claimed refuted each of the government&#x27;s claims for why the line must be built down the west side of the province. The line was constructed on the western route and completed in 2018.

==System components==
The transmission system is currently composed of three bipole transmission lines with their converter stations and ground return electrodes to enable monopole operation.

===Bipole 1===

Bipole 1 runs from Radisson to Dorsey. It was originally rated to run at a maximum potential difference of ±450 kilovolts and a maximum power of 1620 megawatts. This results in an electric current of 1800 amperes.

Bipole 1 consists of six 6-pulse converter groups at each end (three in series per pole), each originally rated at 150 kV DC, 1800 A. Each converter group can be bridged at the DC side with a vacuum switch. Subsequent upgrades have increased the current rating to 2000 A and the voltage rating of most equipment to 166 kV per bridge (i.e., 500 kV total), although as of January 2013 Manitoba Hydro still report that the line is operated at +463 kV/−450 kV.

When it was built between March 1971 and October 1977, mercury-arc valves were used to rectify the alternating current. These valves, supplied by English Electric, each had six anode columns in parallel and were the most powerful mercury arc valves ever built. Each of them had a weight of , a length of , a width of and a height of . Between 1992 and 1993 the mercury arc valves of Pole 1 were replaced with solid state thyristors from GEC Alsthom, increasing the maximum power and voltage of the line to its current levels. The mercury arc valves of Pole 2 were replaced later by Siemens. By the end of 2004 the last of the mercury arc valves in Pole 2 had been replaced by thyristors.

At both Radisson and Dorsey, the thyristors are situated in the same hall where the mercury arc valves originally stood. At both locations, the hall has a height of , a width of and a length of .

===Bipole 2===
The Bipole 2 transmission line runs from Henday to Dorsey. Bipole 2 can transfer a maximum power of 1800 MW at a potential of ±500 kV. Bipole 2 consists of four 12-pulse converter groups at each end (two in series per pole) and was put into service in two stages. After the first stage in 1978 the maximum power was 900 MW at 250 kV, which increased to its present figure when it was completed in 1985.

Bipole 2 crosses Nelson River at 56.459811 N 94.143273 W. There is a backup crossing of Nelson River at 56.441383 N 94.176114 W. It is not possible to directly switch the line to the backup crossing.

Unlike Bipole 1, Bipole 2 has always been equipped with thyristors. The thyristors, supplied by the German HVDC consortium (Siemens, AEG and Brown Boveri) used water cooling for the first time in an HVDC project. Until that time, the relatively few HVDC schemes using thyristors had used either air cooling or, as on the Cahora Bassa project supplied by the same consortium, oil-cooling.
The thyristors were arranged in floor-mounted vertical stacks of four each (&quot;quadrivalves&quot;). Each set contained 96 thyristor levels in series, with two in parallel. These were arranged in 16 thyristor modules connected in series with 8 reactor modules.
===Bipole 3===
In 1996 an extreme wind effect damaged both Bipoles 1 and 2 and threatened to black out Winnipeg. Power was maintained by importing from Minnesota while the two existing Bipoles were repaired. To avoid a repetition of this event, and further improve the reliability of the power supply, Manitoba Hydro examined routes further to the west for their Bipole 3 line. The plans also include an additional converter station and feeder lines around the city. Bipole 3 construction started in 2012. The line was completed and entered service in July 2018.

The main elements of the Bipole III system are:
* Keewatinoow Converter Station, located on the Nelson River near the site of the proposed Conawapa Generating Station at 
* A 1,324 km bipolar transmission line operating at nominally +/-500 kV, running to the West of Lake Manitoba
* Riel Converter Station, on the east side of the Winnipeg Floodway, in the Rural Municipality of Springfield at 
* Additional 230 kV AC lines for the northern collector system.

The line uses guyed steel towers in northern stretches of the line and self-supporting steel lattice towers in the southern part. On average there will be about two structures per kilometre. Each tower carries a bundled conductor for each pole. Each pole conductor is made of three sub-conductors equivalent to 1,590 MCM ACSR. Conductors are supported by toughened glass or porcelain strain insulators with a maximum clearance to ground level of 34 metres, with a minimum of 13.2 metres at mid span and maximum conductor sag. The top of the towers carries an optical ground cable providing grounding interconnection for the towers and optical fibers for control and communication of the system.

Typically the right-of-way for the HVDC line is 66 metres, with 45 metres cleared directly below the line.

The system is capable of transmitting 2000 megawatts from the Nelson River stations to loads in the south.

=== Ground return electrodes ===
Although normally each of the lines run as bipolar systems, if a pole is shut down for maintenance or a fault, the ground return electrode is used to maintain partial capacity operation.

Bipoles 1 and 2 share a ground electrode of &quot;ring&quot; type, in diameter, from the Dorsey Converter Plant at . The Dorsey electrode is connected with the converter plant by two overhead lines on wooden poles, one for Bipole 1 and one for Bipole 2.

At Radisson, Bipole 1 uses a ground electrode of the same size and type as Dorsey, but only away from the station at .

Bipole 2 uses a ground electrode in diameter, and from the Henday Converter Station .

Bipole 3 has a ground electrode site near the Keewatinoow Converter Station at connected by a 30 km electrode line. At the southern Riel Converter Station, the electrode line runs about 26 km to a grounding electrode site at near Hazelridge, Manitoba.

<doc id="860821" wikidata="Q1563633" url="?curid=860821" title="HVDC Kingsnorth">
<text>HVDC Kingsnorth was a high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system connecting Kingsnorth in Kent to two sites in London. It was at one time the only application of the technology of high voltage direct current transmission for the supply of transformer stations in a city, and the first HVDC link to be embedded within an AC system, rather than interconnecting two asynchronous systems. It was also the first HVDC scheme to be equipped with self-tuning harmonic filters and to be controlled with a &quot;Phase Locked Oscillator&quot;, a principle which subsequently became standard on all HVDC systems.

It was designed in the late 1960s and went into service in 1974. It ran from Kingsnorth power station as a 59 kilometers long bipolar (3-wire) underground cable. The positive pole operating at a voltage of +266 kV terminated at the converter station in Beddington near Croydon. The negative pole continued to run a further 26 kilometers at -266 kV line to a similar station at Willesden in North London.

There was also the possibility, if the converter station in Kingsnorth was out of service, to run the system as monopolar HVDC between the Beddington and Willesden stations. The HVDC Kingsnorth was one of the last HVDC schemes equipped with mercury vapour rectifiers, which were ARAG/4-valves designed by English Electric. Each converter station for 266 kV consisted of two six-pulse valve bridges for 132 kV switched in series, which were each fed via a star-star and a star-delta connected transformer.

Apart from the Nelson River Bipole 1 system in Canada, all later-built HVDC systems used thyristor valves. The Kingsnorth HVDC scheme could transfer a maximum power of 640 megawatts (320 megawatts per pole).

In 1981, one mercury arc valve at Willesden Static Inverter Plant, was replaced by a H200 thyristor valve, developed by English Electric.

The system described was shut down in 1986 or 1987 following system reinforcement on the network it was embedded in. However the capacitor banks located at Kingsorth were used for voltage control on the network. These were later removed from the system completely in the mid 1980s? (1990s?) as they contained PCB.

<doc id="860843" wikidata="Q5469813" url="?curid=860843" title="Forked Deer River">
<text>The Forked Deer River system is the main drainage of the central portion of West Tennessee. Locals pronounce the first word of the river&#x27;s name with two syllables, as in “Forkéd” ().

The Forked Deer consists of various streams designated &quot;Forked Deer&quot; and their tributaries. Much of the Forked Deer drainage basin was initially wetlands; however much of this area has been drained and most Forked Deer tributaries have been channelized for agricultural purposes. In the mid-20th century much of this was done under the auspices of the Obion-Forked Deer Basin Authority, a Tennessee state agency. Environmental concerns have led to the cessation of channelization on a widespread basis; the federal government&#x27;s &quot;no net loss&quot; policy regarding wetlands means that further channelization must be offset by creating new wetlands, called &quot;mitigation lands&quot;, elsewhere.
Much of the channelized flow is routed into the Obion River just above the mouth of that river into the Mississippi, other streams related to the system have their own mouths into the Mississippi. In some areas where the historic channels are left in place even after the bulk of the flow has been routed into new ones, the historic channels at times still demonstrate considerable flow, especially after heavy rains.

Local historians record that barges and small riverboats plied the Forked Deer in the early 19th century as far up river as the present location of the city of Jackson. Siltation from agricultural run-off eventually choked the river, and channelization became a major focus of West Tennessee politicians until the 1970s. River cutoffs have left numerous small finger lakes that are popular with local crappie and bass fishers. Otherwise, the river is a slow-moving canal with little scenic appeal.

<doc id="860845" wikidata="Q3110726" url="?curid=860845" title="Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)">
<text>The Sharpshooter, also known as the sasori-gatame (蠍固め or サソリ固め; English: scorpion hold) and the Scorpion Deathlock, is a professional wrestling submission hold. Similar to several holds such as the cloverleaf leg-lace, the Boston crab and the standing reverse figure-four leglock, the move was invented by Japanese professional wrestler Riki Choshu, and was popularized by Sting and Bret Hart as the Scorpion Deathlock and Sharpshooter respectively.

The hold begins with the opponent supine on the mat. The applying wrestler steps between the opponent&#x27;s legs with their own left leg and wraps the opponent&#x27;s legs at shin level around that leg. If they decide to cross the opponent&#x27;s legs around their own right leg, they have to cross the opponent&#x27;s right leg over to the left or the left leg over the right. Holding the opponent&#x27;s legs in place, they then grab the opponent&#x27;s leg which they have crossed over the other and steps over the opponent, flipping them over into a prone position before leaning back to compress their lower back. This move is used more commonly by Canadian wrestlers, typically in Canada, to get a bigger crowd reaction, since it is associated with Bret Hart and the Hart family; Canadian wrestlers Edge and Chris Benoit were also notable users of the move.

==History and variations==
While Bret Hart is the wrestler with whom the Sharpshooter is most often associated, Ronnie Garvin and Sting were the first wrestlers to prolifically use the hold in North America, during which time it was called the &quot;Scorpion Deathlock&quot;, deriving from the original Japanese name. In Hart&#x27;s autobiography, he noted that prior to his first major singles push, Pat Patterson asked if he could do the move, which he was familiar with from Japan, but did not know how to execute. Hart revealed that the only person in the locker room who knew how to execute the move was Konnan, who taught it to Hart. Its name was based on Hart&#x27;s &quot;Hit Man&quot; nickname (from the underworld slang &quot;hit&quot;, murder). In WWF publications of the era, Bret&#x27;s father Stu Hart, long known as a trainer in the game, was generally given credit for devising the move. Edge innovated an inverse variation, which he has dubbed the &quot;Edgecator&quot;, where he would apply the hold normally, only to face the opposite direction and kneel on the opponent&#x27;s legs.

The Sharpshooter was infamously used in the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series in 1997. Shawn Michaels applied Hart&#x27;s own Sharpshooter on him. Vince McMahon double-crossed Hart by ordering referee Earl Hebner to ring the bell and award the match to Michaels, despite Hart never having submitted. This moment would be referenced within kayfabe through various future events; McMahon repeated the action at the next year&#x27;s Survivor Series in 1998, as part of a storyline, during the &quot;Deadly Game&quot; tournament final between The Rock and Mankind. Another occurred on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot;, during a Street Fight between Shawn Michaels and Shane McMahon.

=== Scorpion cross lock ===
Also known as an inverted sharpshooter combined with a double chickenwing, this hold sets up the same as the sharpshooter, with the opponent supine on the mat with the applying wrestler stepping between the opponent&#x27;s legs with their right leg, and wrapping the opponent&#x27;s legs at shin level around that leg. However, instead of stepping over the opponent to flip them, the applying wrestler flips the opponent over from left-to-right, keeping the opponent in front of them. The applying wrestler then leans over the opponent and grabs their arms, applying a double chicken wing to the opponent. The applying wrestler then squats back, lifting the opponent&#x27;s torso into the air. The move was used by Bull Nakano and formerly used by Saraya Bevis, which was coined as the &quot;PTO&quot; (derived from their then ring-name &quot;Paige&quot;).

<doc id="860856" wikidata="Q11884760" url="?curid=860856" title="Norman Baillie-Stewart">
<text>Norman Baillie-Stewart (15 January 1909 – 7 June 1966) was a British army officer who was arrested in 1933 for espionage, and subsequently convicted and imprisoned.

He was an active sympathiser of Nazi Germany, and moved there after his release from prison in 1937; he became a naturalised German citizen in 1940. Before and during World War II, he made English-language propaganda radio broadcasts and became one of several broadcasters associated with the nickname Lord Haw-Haw. After Germany&#x27;s defeat, he was again imprisoned. He was released in 1949 and spent the remainder of his life in Ireland. He died in 1966.

In 1933, he became widely known as &quot;The Officer in the Tower&quot; as he was imprisoned in the Tower of London after his first arrest, becoming the last British subject to be held in the Tower as a proper prisoner.

==Early life==

Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s father was Lieutenant Colonel Cron Hope Baillie Wright (1875-1937) an officer in the British Indian Army who served in the 62nd Punjabis during the First World War. His mother was from a family with a long tradition of military service. His older brother, Eric Codrington Stewart Wright (1905-1987) also joined the army, and became a 2nd Lieutenant in the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in 1925.

Baillie-Stewart attended Bedford School and the Britannia Royal Naval College, before attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, under a cadet scholarship. There, he served as an orderly to Prince Henry, a younger son of King George V.

In January 1929, just before he graduated, he changed his surname from Wright to Baillie-Stewart, perhaps under the belief that he was looked down upon by more senior officers. He graduated tenth in the order of merit and in February 1929 received a commission as a subaltern in the Seaforth Highlanders although he soon grew to dislike army life.

In 1929, Baillie-Stewart was posted to the Seaforth&#x27;s Second Battalion in India. In 1930, he saw active service on the North West Frontier, where he was reprimanded by his company commander for removing a native banner from an Afridi tribal graveyard, which aggravated tensions with local tribesmen. He later replaced the banner on the orders of a senior officer.

A campaign medal was authorised for that campaign, but Baillie-Stewart did not receive it. 

He returned to England in early 1931 after he had applied for transfer to the Royal Army Service Corps.

==Espionage career==

In August 1932, the British Security service, MI5, became aware that a man in Berlin, who claimed to be a British army officer, had attempted to gain an interview at the German War Office. The British embassy in Berlin tentatively identified the man as Norman Baillie-Stuart. An investigation was begun, in the hands of Major William Hinchley-Cooke of MI5.

Hinchley-Cook searched Baillie-Stuart&#x27;s quarters and began intercepting his mail; this revealed his communications with a German contact. During the autumn of 1932, Baillie-Stewart made three weekend trips to the Netherlands, briefly meeting a German contact in Rotterdam each time, although MI5 was initially unaware of this as they confined their investigation to intercepting his mail. In November 1932, MI5 opened a letter to him containing £50 in £5 banknotes. Baillie-Stuart replied with a letter to &quot;Herr Obst&quot; in Berlin. A second letter to Baillie-Stuart in December contained £40 in £10 notes.

In January 1933, it was decided to confront Baillie-Stuart with the gathered evidence, and offer him the chance to quietly resign from the army in exchange for information about his contact in Germany. He refused to do this and so was charged with offences against the Official Secrets Act. He wrote a further letter to &quot;Herr Obst&quot; in Germany, describing his predicament, which he gave to his Adjutant to post. However the adjutant instead gave it to Major Hinchley-Cooke.

On 20 March 1933, Baillie-Stuart was taken to the Tower of London, the authorities believed this was the least-open military establishment in London, and holding him there would help keep the matter out of the public eye. He was the last British subject to be held in the Tower as a proper prisoner, rather than as one awaiting transfer. However this attempt at concealment backfired. The story of Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s arrest was revealed in the press by the well-known romance novelist Barbara Cartland (then working as a gossip columnist) who got the details from an acquaintance. The story of an officer from a prestigious regiment, facing the unprecedented charges of espionage and held in the famous Tower of London quickly became a press sensation.

Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s court-martial was held at Chelsea Barracks and began on 20 March. There were ten charges under the Official Secrets Act 1911 for selling military secrets to a foreign power. Baillie-Stewart pleaded not-guilty to all charges. Because Britain was not at war, he was not in danger of execution, but the ten charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 140 years in jail.

The court was told that Baillie-Stewart began to offend in 1931 when he met and fell in love with a German woman while he was holidaying in Germany. He decided to become a German citizen and wrote a letter to the German Consul in London to offer his services. Receiving no answer, he travelled to Berlin without permission to take leave, where he telephoned the German Foreign Ministry and demanded to talk to an English-speaker. That resulted in him making contact with a Major Mueller under the Brandenburg Gate, where he agreed to spy for Germany.
Using the pretext of studying for Staff College examinations, he borrowed from the Aldershot Military Library specifications and photographs of an experimental tank, the Vickers A1E1 Independent, as well as a new automatic rifle and notes on the organisation of tank and armoured car units.

Baillie-Stewart was convicted of seven of the ten charges against him and was sentenced to cashiering and five-years in prison. Soon after, while held in Wormwood Scrubs, he was interviewed again by an MI5 officer and revealed that the &quot;Herr Obst&quot; he had addressed his letters to had been the cover-name of Major Muller (&quot;Muller&quot; was also likely a cover-name). Marie-Luise had been merely a figment of his controller&#x27;s imagination. Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s code-name was &quot;Poiret&quot; (little pear). That and Marie-Luise (a variety of pear) were names used to conceal the correspondence with Muller. Muller&#x27;s cover name, &quot;Obst&quot;, was the German word for &quot;fruit&quot;

Baillie-Stuart was released from Maidstone Prison on 20 January 1937.

==German collaboration==

In August 1937, eight months after his release from prison, Baillie-Stewart moved to Vienna, where he applied for Austrian citizenship, however, it was refused since he did not meet the residency qualification. In February 1938, the Austrian government, led by Kurt Schuschnigg, suspected him of being a Nazi agent and gave him three weeks to leave Austria. Officials at the British embassy in Vienna refused to help him once they learned who he was and Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s disenchantment with Britain was increased. Rather than return to Britain he went to Bratislava, which was then in Czechoslovakia.

Following the Anschluss, Baillie-Stewart was able to return to Austria, where he made a modest living by operating a trading company. He applied for naturalisation, but the application was delayed by bureaucracy at the ministry, and he did not become a German citizen until 1940.

In July 1939, Baillie-Stewart attended a friend&#x27;s party in which he happened to hear some German English-language propaganda broadcasts. He criticised the broadcasts and was overheard by a guest at the party who happened to work at the Austrian radio station. He informed his superiors of Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s comments, and after a successful voice test in Berlin, Baillie-Stewart was ordered by the German Propaganda Ministry to report to the Reich Broadcasting Corporation (&quot;Reichsrundfunk&quot;) in Berlin, where he became a propaganda broadcaster in August 1939, taking over as chief broadcaster from Wolf Mittler. Baillie-Stewart made his first broadcast reading pro-Nazi news on the &quot;Germany Calling&quot; English-language service a week before the United Kingdom declared war on Germany.

It has been speculated that it was Baillie-Stewart who made the broadcast that led the pseudonymous &quot;Daily Express&quot; radio critic Jonah Barrington to coin the term &quot;Haw-Haw&quot;. The nickname possibly referenced Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s exaggeratedly aristocratic way of speaking, but Wolf Mittler is usually considered a more likely candidate. When William Joyce later became the most prominent Nazi propaganda broadcaster, Barrington appended the title and named Joyce &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot; since the true identity of the broadcaster was then unknown. Another nickname possibly applied to Baillie-Stewart was &quot;Sinister Sam&quot;.

By the end of September 1939, it had been clear to the radio authorities that Joyce, originally Baillie-Stewart&#x27;s backup man, was more effective. Baillie-Stewart, who had gradually become disenchanted with the material that he had to broadcast, was dismissed in December 1939, shortly after his last radio broadcast. He continued to work in Berlin as a translator for the German Foreign Ministry and lectured in English at Berlin University. In early 1940, he acquired German citizenship.

In early 1942, Baillie-Stewart made a brief return to radio under the alias of &quot;Lancer&quot;. He made several broadcasts for both the &quot;Reichsrundfunk&quot; and Radio Luxembourg. He spent much time avoiding the more blatant propaganda material he was asked to present. He translated to English the words of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, which were sung by Lale Andersen as a form of propaganda towards Allied soldiers but then taken up strongly by the Allies themselves.

In 1944, Baillie-Stewart had himself sent to Vienna for medical treatment, where he was arrested in 1945 in Altaussee, while he was wearing &quot;chamois leather shorts, embroidered braces and a forester&#x27;s jacket&quot;, and was sent back to Britain to face charges of high treason.

==Postwar==

Baillie-Stewart avoided execution only because the Attorney-General, Hartley Shawcross, did not think he could successfully try him on charges of high treason since he had German citizenship and instead decided to try him on the lesser charge of &quot;committing an act likely to assist the enemy&quot;. The Security Service (MI5) reportedly lobbied for him to be sent to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, where there would be no &quot;namby-pamby legal hair-splitting&quot;.

In January 1946, Baillie-Stewart was charged under the 1939 Defence Regulations with aiding the enemy; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released from HM Prison Parkhurst in May 1949. He moved to Ireland, where he lived under the pseudonyms of James Scott and Patrick Stuart.

In Ireland, he married and settled in the Dublin suburb of Raheny. He had two children before he died of a heart attack after collapsing at a pub in Harmonstown in June 1966. At the time of his death, he had just completed his autobiography, which he had co-written with John Murdock. This was posthumously published in 1967.

<text>In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) by athletes, as a way of cheating. As stated in the World Anti-Doping Code by WADA, doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the anti-doping rule violations outlined in Article 2.1 through Article 2.11 of the Code. The term &quot;doping&quot; is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical and is prohibited by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating.

The origins of doping in sports go back to the creation of the sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in chariot racing to more recent controversies in doping in baseball, doping in tennis, doping at the Olympic Games, and doping at the Tour de France, popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to regulate the use of drugs in sports strictly. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sports for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the &quot;spirit of sport&quot;.
==History==
The use of drugs in sports goes back centuries, about back to the very invention of the concept of sports. In ancient times, when the fittest of a nation were selected as athletes or combatants, they were fed diets and given treatments considered beneficial to help increase muscle. For instance, Scandinavian mythology says Berserkers could drink a mixture called &quot;butotens&quot; to greatly improve their physical power at the risk of insanity, which is thought to have been prepared using the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; mushroom.

The ancient Olympics in Greece have been alleged to have had forms of doping. In ancient Rome, where chariot racing had become a huge part of their culture, athletes drank herbal infusions to strengthen them before chariot races.

From that moment, people started to introduce their specific diets to improve their performance. Lots of athletes were mainly focusing on achieving superiority and winning the competition by increasing muscle strength capacity, and endurance. Charmis, the Spartan winner of the Stade race in the Olympic Games of 668BC, introduced the special diet of consuming enough dried figs during the training period.

A participant in an endurance walking race in Britain, Abraham Wood, said in 1807 that he had used laudanum (which contains opiates) to keep him awake for 24 hours while competing against Robert Barclay Allardyce. By April 1877, walking races had stretched to and the following year, also at the Agricultural Hall in Islington, London, to . The &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; chided:

:It may be an advantage to know that a man can travel 520 miles in 138 hours, and manage to live through a week with an infinitesimal amount of rest, though we fail to perceive that anyone could possibly be placed in a position where his ability in this respect would be of any use to him [and] what is to be gained by a constant repetition of the fact.

The event proved popular, however, with 20,000 spectators attending each day. Encouraged, the promoters developed the idea and soon held similar races for cyclists.

:&quot;...and much more likely to endure their miseries publicly; a tired walker, after all, merely sits down – a tired cyclist falls off and possibly brings others crashing down as well. That&#x27;s much more fun&quot;.

The fascination with six-day bicycle races spread across the Atlantic and appealed to the crowds in America as well. And the more spectators paid at the gate, the higher the prizes could be and the greater was the incentive of riders to stay awake—or be kept awake—to ride the greatest distance. Their exhaustion was countered by soigneurs (the French word for &quot;healers&quot;), helpers akin to seconds in boxing. Among the treatments they supplied was nitroglycerine, a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders&#x27; breathing. Riders had hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion Major Taylor refused to continue the New York race, saying: &quot;I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.&quot;

Public reaction turned against such trials, whether individual races or in teams of two. One report said:

:An athletic contest in which the participants &#x27;go queer&#x27; in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport, it is brutality. It appears from the reports of this singular performance that some of the bicycle riders have actually become temporarily insane during the contest... Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.

The father of anabolic steroids in the United States was John Ziegler (1917–1983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting team in the mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team&#x27;s success was due to their use of testosterone as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted in the creation of methandrostenolone, which appeared on the market in 1960 under the brand name Dianabol. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race. An autopsy later revealed the presence of amphetamines and a drug called nicotinyl tartrate in his system.

The American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: &quot;Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures.&quot; John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were &quot;de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion.&quot;

== Prevalence ==
Over 30% of athletes participating in 2011 World Championships in Athletics admitted having used banned substances during their careers. According to a study commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), actually 44% of them had used them. Nevertheless, only 0.5% of those tested were caught.

The entire Russian track and field team was banned from the 2016 Olympic Games, as the Russian State had sponsored and essentially sanctioned their doping program.

===Goldman&#x27;s dilemma===

Goldman&#x27;s dilemma, or the Goldman dilemma, is a question that was posed to elite athletes by physician, osteopath and publicist Bob Goldman, asking whether they would take a drug that would guarantee them success in sport, but cause them to die after five years. In his research, as in previous research by Mirkin, approximately half the athletes responded that they would take the drug, but modern research by James Connor and co-workers has yielded much lower numbers, with athletes having levels of acceptance of the dilemma that were similar to the general population of Australia.

== Substances ==

The most common prohibited substances for doping in sport are:
* Anabolic steroids (most common), which increase muscle mass and physical strength.
* Stimulants (second most common), which increase excitement and decrease the sensation of fatigue.
Examples of well known stimulants include caffeine, cocaine, amphetamine, modafinil, and ephedrine. Caffeine, although a stimulant, has not been banned by the International Olympic Committee or the World Anti Doping Agency since 2004. It has a positive effect on various physical parameters, most of all endurance, but also on velocity, strength, reaction time and specific actions like throwing performance.

Other ways of cheating that change the body without using foreign substances include injecting one&#x27;s own red blood cells as done with doping at the Tour de France, treating blood with UV light or the use of a hyperbaric chamber (not currently banned), and, potentially, gene doping.

===Anabolic steroids===

Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to induce bone growth, stimulate appetite, induce male puberty, and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and AIDS. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in sports and bodybuilding to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, and liver damage. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.

AAS use in American sports began in October 1954 when John Ziegler, a doctor who treated American athletes, went to Vienna with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physician who, over &quot;a few drinks&quot;, repeatedly asked &quot;What are you giving your boys?&quot; When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects. Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit upon the anabolic steroid methandrostenolone, first made in the US in 1958 by Ciba and marketed as Dianabol (colloquially known as &quot;d-bol&quot;).

The results were so impressive that lifters began taking more, and steroids spread to other sports. Paul Lowe, a former running back with the San Diego Chargers American football team, told a California legislative committee on drug abuse in 1970: &quot;We had to take them [steroids] at lunchtime. He [an official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine.&quot;

Olympic statistics show the weight of shot putters increased 14 percent between 1956 and 1972, whereas steeplechasers weight increased 7.6 percent. The gold medalist pentathlete Mary Peters said: &quot;A medical research team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, only to discover that there were so few who weren&#x27;t taking them that they couldn&#x27;t establish any worthwhile comparisons.&quot; Brand name Dianabol is no longer produced but the drug methandrostenolone itself is still made in many countries and other, similar drugs are made elsewhere. The use of anabolic steroids is now banned by all major sporting bodies, including the ATP, WTA, ITF, International Olympic Committee, FIFA, UEFA, all major professional golf tours, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the European Athletic Association, WWE, the NFL, and the UCI. However, drug testing can be wildly inconsistent and, in some instances, has gone unenforced.

A number of studies measuring anabolic steroid use in high school athletes found that out of all 12th grade students, 6.6 percent of them had used anabolic steroids at some point in their high school careers or were approached and counseled to use them. Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic–androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball. A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.

==== Types of drug controls ====
There are two different types of controls that can be conducted in competition or in training. It is important that tests are conducted by independent organizations that treat each athlete equally, indifferent of fame or nationality.
* Announced tests: The athletes know when they are tested.
* Unannounced tests: Athletes don&#x27;t know when they are tested. These tests are the effective ones when they are conducted outside of the competition periods.

====1988 Seoul Olympics====
A famous case of AAS use in a competition was Canadian Ben Johnson&#x27;s victory in the 100 m at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He subsequently failed the drug test when stanozolol was found in his urine. He later admitted to using the steroid as well as Dianabol, testosterone, Furazabol, and human growth hormone amongst other things. Johnson was stripped of his gold medal as well as his world-record performance. Carl Lewis was then promoted one place to take the Olympic gold title. Lewis had also run under the current world record time and was therefore recognized as the new record holder.

Johnson was not the only participant whose success was questioned: Lewis had tested positive at the Olympic Trials for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.

The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988. Now it is regarded as negative test; the acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot;

Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration.

Linford Christie of Great Britain was found to have metabolites of pseudoephedrine in his urine after a 200m heat at the same Olympics, but was later cleared of any wrongdoing. Of the top five competitors in the race, only former world record holder and eventual bronze medalist Calvin Smith of the US never failed a drug test during his career. Smith later said: &quot;I should have been the gold medalist.&quot;

The CBC radio documentary, &quot;Rewind&quot;, &quot;Ben Johnson: A Hero Disgraced&quot; broadcast on 19 September 2013, for the 25th anniversary of the race, stated 20 athletes tested positive for drugs but were cleared by the IOC at this 1988 Seoul Olympics. An IOC official stated that endocrine profiles done at those games indicated that 80 percent of the track and field athletes tested showed evidence of long-term steroid use, although not all were banned.

===Stimulants===
Stimulants are drugs that usually act on the central nervous system to modulate mental function and behavior, increasing an individual&#x27;s sense of excitement, decreasing the sensation of fatigue and improving motor coordination. The latter happens via improvement of the interaction between nervous system and musculature. It has greater effect when an athlete is already exhausted - the period when the coordination suffers the most. In the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances, stimulants are the second largest class after the anabolic steroids.

Benzedrine is a trade name for amphetamine. The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by Gordon Alles. Its perceived effects gave it the street name &quot;speed&quot;. British troops used 72 million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War and the RAF got through so many that &quot;Methedrine won the Battle of Britain&quot; according to one report. The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a thymoleptic before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.

Everton, one of the top clubs in the English football league, were champions of the 1962–63 season, and it was done, according to a national newspaper investigation, with the help of Benzedrine. Word spread after Everton&#x27;s win that the drug had been involved. The newspaper investigated, cited where the reporter believed it had come from, and quoted the goalkeeper, Albert Dunlop, as saying:

:I cannot remember how they first came to be offered to us. But they were distributed in the dressing rooms. We didn&#x27;t have to take them but most of the players did. The tablets were mostly white but once or twice they were yellow. They were used through the 1961–62 season and the championship season which followed it. Drug-taking had previously been virtually unnamed in the club. But once it had started we could have as many tablets as we liked. On match days they were handed out to most players as a matter of course. Soon some of the players could not do without the drugs.

The club agreed that drugs had been used but that they &quot;could not possibly have had any harmful effect.&quot; Dunlop, however, said he had become an addict.

In November 1942, the Italian cyclist Fausto Coppi took &quot;seven packets of amphetamine&quot; to beat the world hour record on the track. In 1960, the Danish rider Knud Enemark Jensen collapsed during the 100 km team time trial at the Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, Ronicol, which dilates the blood vessels. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that &quot;dope – whole cartloads – [were] used in such royal quantities.&quot;

The 1950s British cycling professional Jock Andrews would joke: &quot;You need never go off-course chasing the peloton in a big race – just follow the trail of empty syringes and dope wrappers.&quot;

The Dutch cycling team manager Kees Pellenaars told of a rider in his care:

:I took him along to a training camp in Spain. The boy changed then into a sort of lion. He raced around as though he was powered by rockets. I went to talk to him. He was really happy he was riding well and he told me to look out for him. I asked if he wasn&#x27;t perhaps &quot;using something&quot; and he jumped straight up, climbed on a chair and from deep inside a cupboard he pulled out a plastic bag full of pills. I felt my heart skip a beat. I had never seen so many fireworks together. With a soigneur we counted the pills: there were 5,000 of them, excluding hormone preparations and sleeping pills. I took them away, to his own relief. I let him keep the hormones and the sleeping pills. Later he seemed to have taken too many at once and he slept for a couple of days on end. We couldn&#x27;t wake him up. We took him to hospital and they pumped out his stomach. They tied him to his bed to prevent anything going wrong again. But one way or another he had some stimulant and fancied taking a walk. A nurse came across him in the corridor, walking along with the bed strapped to his back.

Currently modafinil is being used throughout the sporting world, with many high-profile cases attracting press coverage as prominent United States athletes have failed tests for this substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested as the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offence, however, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) maintains it is a substance related to those already banned, so the decisions stand. Modafinil was added to the list of prohibited substances on 3 August 2004, ten days before the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics.

One approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects. Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included mephedrone, ephedrone, and fluoroamphetamines, which have chemical structures and effects similar to ephedrine and amphetamine.

===Strychnine===

These &quot;de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion&quot; were not unknown outside cycling.

Thomas Hicks, an American born in England on 7 January 1875, won the Olympic marathon in 1904. He crossed the line behind a fellow American Fred Lorz, who had been transported for 11 miles of the course by his trainer, leading to his disqualification. However, Hicks&#x27;s trainer Charles Lucas, pulled out a syringe and came to his aid as his runner began to struggle.

:I therefore decided to inject him with a milligram of sulphate of strychnine and to make him drink a large glass brimming with brandy. He set off again as best he could [but] he needed another injection four miles from the end to give him a semblance of speed and to get him to the finish.

The use of strychnine, at the time, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, according to sports historians Alain Lunzenfichter and historian of sports doping, Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, who said:

:It has to be appreciated that at the time the menace of doping for the health of athletes or of the purity of competition had yet to enter the morals because, after this marathon, the official race report said: The marathon has shown from a medical point of view how drugs can be very useful to athletes in long-distance races.

Hicks was, in the phrase of the time, &quot;between life and death&quot; but recovered, collected his gold medal a few days later, and lived until 1952. Nonetheless, he never again took part in athletics.

===East Germany (the GDR)===

In 1977 one of East Germany&#x27;s best sprinters, Renate Neufeld, fled to the West with the Bulgarian she later married. A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

:At 17, I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute. My speciality was the 80m hurdles. We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. The training was very hard. We were all watched. We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. One day, my trainer, Günter Clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds. My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn&#x27;t talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fiancé.

She brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story.
East Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965. In 1977 the shot-putter Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93 kg, failed a test for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in Helsinki and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near Dresden passed into government control; it reputedly made around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised.

The International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in Prague. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal, which she won.

After that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports-writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot;, who said:

:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the birth control pill. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.

Other reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West – 15 of them between 1976 and 1979. One, the ski-jumper Hans-Georg Aschenbach, said: &quot;Long-distance skiers start having injections to their knees from the age 14 because of their intensive training.&quot; He said: &quot;For every Olympic champion, there are at least 350 invalids. There are gymnasts among the girls who have to wear corsets from the age of 18 because their spine and their ligaments have become so worn... There are young people so worn out by the intensive training that they come out of it mentally blank [&quot;lessivés&quot; – washed out], which is even more painful than a deformed spine.&quot;

After the 1990 German reunification, on 26 August 1993 the records were opened and evidence found that the Stasi, the state secret police, supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990. Doping existed in other countries, says the expert Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, both communist and capitalist, but the difference with East Germany was that it was a state policy. The &quot;Sportvereinigung Dynamo&quot; (English:&quot;Dynamo Sports Club&quot;) was especially singled out as a center for doping in the former East Germany. Many former club officials and some athletes found themselves charged after the dissolution of the country. Victims of doping, trying to gain justice and compensation, set up a special page on the internet to list people involved in doping in the GDR.

State-endorsed doping began with the Cold War of 1947–1991, when every Eastern Bloc gold represented an ideological victory. From 1974, Manfred Ewald, the head of East Germany&#x27;s sports federation, imposed blanket doping. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the country of 17 million collected nine gold medals. Four years later the total was 20 and in 1976 it doubled again to 40. Ewald was quoted as having told coaches, &quot;They&#x27;re still so young and don&#x27;t have to know everything.&quot; In July 2000 Ewald received a 22-month suspended sentence, to the outrage of his victims. Often, doping took place without the knowledge of the athletes, some of them as young as ten years of age. It is estimated that around 10,000 former athletes bear the physical and mental scars of years of drug abuse; one of them, Rica Reinisch, a triple Olympic champion and world record-setter at the 1980 Summer Olympics, has since had numerous miscarriages and recurring ovarian cysts.

Two former Dynamo Berlin club doctors, Dieter Binus, chief of the national women&#x27;s team from 1976 to 1980, and Bernd Pansold, in charge of the sports medicine center in East Berlin, were committed for trial for allegedly supplying 19 teenagers with illegal substances. Binus was sentenced in August, Pansold in December 1998 – both were found guilty of administering hormones to underage female athletes from 1975 to 1984.

Virtually no East German athlete ever failed an official drugs test, though Stasi files show that many did produce failed tests at Kreischa, the Saxon laboratory (German:&quot;Zentrales Dopingkontroll-Labor des Sportmedizinischen Dienstes&quot;) that was at the time approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), now called the &quot;Institute of Doping Analysis and Sports Biochemistry&quot; (IDAS). In 2005, 15 years after the end of East Germany, the manufacturer of the drugs, Jenapharm, still found itself involved in numerous lawsuits from doping victims, being sued by almost 200 former athletes.

Former Sport Club Dynamo athletes Daniela Hunger and Andrea Pollack publicly admitted to doping and accused their coaches for being responsible. Another former Sport Dynamo athlete, Ilona Slupianek, was disqualified for doping. (&quot;Ilona Slupianek failed a test along with three Finnish athletes at the 1977 European Cup, becoming the only East German athlete ever to be convicted of doping&quot;)

Based on the admission by Pollack, the United States Olympic Committee asked for the redistribution of gold medals won in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Despite court rulings in Germany that substantiate claims of systematic doping by some East German swimmers, the IOC executive board announced that it has no intention of revising the Olympic record books. In rejecting the American petition on behalf of its women&#x27;s medley relay team in Montreal and a similar petition from the British Olympic Association on behalf of Sharron Davies, the IOC made it clear that it wanted to discourage any such appeals in the future.

===West Germany===

The 800-page &quot;Doping in Germany from 1950 to today&quot; study details how the West German government helped fund a wide-scale doping programme. West Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades. Clemens Prokop, head of Germany&#x27;s athletics federation, told Reuters Television in an interview, &quot;It is a bit of a problem that there is a short version that has been published and that names have not been named.&quot;

Immediately after the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final, rumors emerged that the West German team had taken performance-enhancing substances. Several members of the team fell ill with jaundice, presumably from a contaminated needle. Members of the team later claimed they had been injected with glucose, and the team physician Franz Loogen said in 2004 that the players had only been given Vitamin C before the game. A Leipzig University study in 2010 posited that the West German players had been injected with the banned substance methamphetamine.

According to the German Olympic Sports Association (DOSB), doping was common in the West German athletes of the 1980s. West German heptathlete Birgit Dressel died at age 26 due to sudden multiple organ failure, triggered at least in part by long-term steroid abuse. In the newly emerging doping discussion in 2013 after submission of the final report of the anti-doping commission, the former German sprinter Manfred Ommer accused the Freiburg physician Armin Klümper: &quot;Klümper was the largest doper on this planet.&quot;

===China===

China conducted a state-sanctioned doping programme on athletes in the 1980s and 1990s. The majority of revelations of Chinese doping have focused on swimmers and track and field athletes, such as Ma Junren&#x27;s &quot;Ma Family Army&quot; ().

More recently, three Chinese weightlifters were stripped of their gold Olympic medals for doping at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

In a July 2012 interview published by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; newspaper, Chen Zhangho, the lead doctor for the Chinese Olympic team at the Los Angeles, Seoul and Barcelona Olympics told of how he had tested hormones, blood doping and steroids on about fifty elite athletes. Chen also accused the United States, the Soviet Union and France of using performance-enhancing drugs at the same time as China.

In 2012 and 2017 Xue Yinxian revealed systematic doping of Chinese athletes in Olympic Games (and in other international sport events). He has claimed that more than 10,000 athletes in China were doped in the systematic Chinese government doping program and that they received performance-enhancing drugs in the 1980s and 1990s. He stated that the entirety of international medals (both in the Olympics and other international competitions) won by Chinese athletes in the 1980s and 1990s must be taken back. This is contrary to previous statements by the Chinese government, which had denied involvement in systematic doping, claiming that athletes doped individually. The International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency have investigated these allegations.

===Soviet Union===

According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency&#x27;s officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the IOC to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were &quot;rescued with [these] tremendous efforts&quot;. On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said &quot;There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists&#x27; Games.&quot;

A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to epitestosterone in urine. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists, would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike&#x27;s unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols. The first documented case of &quot;blood doping&quot; occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics as a runner was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000 m and 10,000 m.

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country&#x27;s decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union&#x27;s head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergey Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

===Russia===

Systematic doping in Russian sports has resulted in 47 Olympic and tens of world championships medals being stripped from Russian competitors—the most of any country, more than four times the number of the runner-up, and more than 30% of the global total. Russia also has the most competitors that have been caught doping at the Olympic Games, with more than 200.

Russian doping is distinct from doping in other countries because in Russia the state supplied steroids and other drugs to sportspeople. Due to widespread doping violations, including an attempt to sabotage ongoing investigations by the manipulation of computer data, on 9 December 2019 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years. As at the 2018 Winter Olympics, WADA will allow individual cleared Russian athletes to compete neutrally under a title to be determined (which may not include the name &quot;Russia&quot;, unlike the use of &quot;Olympic Athletes from Russia&quot; in 2018).

Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, on review of Russia&#x27;s appeal of its case from WADA, ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had imposed. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as &quot;Neutral Athlete&quot; or &quot;Neutral Team&quot;. The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display &quot;Russia&quot; on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag&#x27;s colors within the uniform&#x27;s design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the &quot;Neutral Athlete/Team&quot; designation. Russia can appeal the decision.

On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym &quot;ROC&quot;, after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms bearing the words &quot;Russian Olympic Committee&quot;, or the acronym &quot;ROC&quot; would be added.

On 15 April 2021, the uniforms for the Russian Olympic Committee athletes were unveiled, featuring the colours of the Russian flag. On 22 April 2021, the replacement for Russia&#x27;s anthem was approved by the IOC, after an earlier choice of the patriotic Russian war song &quot;Katyusha&quot; was rejected. A fragment of Pyotr Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 is used.

===United States===

The United States has had eight Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. In the case of swimmer Rick DeMont, the USOC recognized his gold-medal performance in the 1972 Summer Olympics in 2001, but only the IOC has the power to restore his medal, and it has refused to do so. DeMont originally won the gold medal in 4:00.26. Following the race, the IOC stripped him of his gold medal after his post-race urinalysis tested positive for traces of the banned substance ephedrine contained in his prescription asthma medication, Marax. The positive test following the 400 meter freestyle final also deprived him of a chance at multiple medals, as he was not permitted to swim in any other events at the 1972 Olympics, including the 1,500-meter freestyle for which he was the then-current world record-holder. Before the Olympics, DeMont had properly declared his asthma medications on his medical disclosure forms, but the USOC had not cleared them with the IOC&#x27;s medical committee.

In 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s director of drug-control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; that revealed that some 100 American athletes failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that they should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete; those athletes included Carl Lewis, Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard. Before showing the documents to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Exum tried to use them in a lawsuit against USOC, accusing the organization of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against him and cover-up over the failed tests. the Denver federal Court summarily dismissed his case for lack of evidence. The USOC labelled his case &quot;baseless&quot; as he himself was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the organization and clarifying that the athletes were cleared according to the rules.

Carl Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had failed tests for banned substances, but claiming he was just one of &quot;hundreds&quot; of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the 1988 Summer Olympics. Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. &quot;For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there&#x27;s absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do. And it is obvious they did not,&quot; said former American sprinter and 1984 Olympic champion, Evelyn Ashford.

Exum&#x27;s documents revealed that Carl Lewis had tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympics trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, which were banned stimulants. Bronchodilators are also found in cold medication. Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight-loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason. The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot; Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. The federation also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with the athletes&#x27; names undisclosed and stated that &quot;the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as &#x27;negative cases&#x27; in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken&quot;.

==Association football==

There have been few incidents of doping in football, mainly due to FIFA&#x27;s belief that education and prevention with constant in and out-of-competition controls play a key role in making high-profile competitions free of performance-enhancing drugs. The FIFA administration work alongside team physicians to fight for dope free competitions, having them sign a joint declaration that states they agree with having routine blood testing to check for blood doping before any FIFA World Cup.

In 2014, the biological passport was introduced in the 2014 FIFA World Cup; blood and urine samples from all players before the competition and from two players per team and per match are analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses.

=== World Cups ===
A study titled &quot;Doping in Germany from 1950 to today&quot;, published in August 2013, stated that some members of the Germany national team received injections during their successful world cup 1954. Erik Eggers, who wrote about the preanabolic period in the study, was sure that the injections didn&#x27;t contain vitamin C (&quot;They could have just eaten an orange&quot;) but assumed that they contained Pervitin. It also stated that Pervitin (an upper, also used massively by soldiers in World War 2) was widespread in German football in the 1940s. The study, 800 pages in length and costing 450.000 Euro, was done by Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt University and financed by the institute of sports science.

Mohammed Kaci Saïd, Djamel Menad, Tedj Bensaoula, Medi Cerbah, Mohamed Chaib, Salah Larbès, Abdelkader Tlemçani, members of Algerias national side in the 1980s, claim that they were given performance-enhancing drugs. They suspect this to be the reason why they all fathered disabled children. Chaib, father of three disabled children, demanded the medical records and was told they didn&#x27;t exist anymore. Rashid Hanafi, team doctor back then, also suspected there were suspicious practices going on. He told CNN that he was &quot;not allowed to take a look at the medical records of the players any more when Rogov took over as coach in 1981&quot;. Alexander Tabartschuk, main doctor of the team, said he only handed vitamins. Algeria fell victim to the Disgrace of Gijón in 1982 and won the African Cup eight years later.

In 1987, Toni Schumacher recounted a huge amount of hormones, pills and injections (Liesen, head of the doctor team, injected 3000 himself) being used by national players during the World Cup 1986 in Mexico (see next chapter).

Argentina took &quot;speedy coffee&quot; before the qualifier for the world cup 1994 against Australia, at least this is what Maradona said in May 2011. It should make them run faster, but also caused sleeping problems. He also found it suspicious that only the deciding match (against Australia) had no anti-doping control. Grondona, chairman of AFA back then, responded that there were no tests because Maradona, who already had a drug history, might not have passed. Maradona tested positive in the world cup.

Immediately after the World Cup 1998, all of the drug testing samples were destroyed. If the same had happened in the Tour de France, Armstrong wouldn&#x27;t have been caught, former WADA director Dr. Alain Garnier argued. Marie-Georges Buffet, sports minister at that time, also recalls that she felt pressurised when she initiated an unannounced test in December 1997. There were no more unannounced tests after that. Jean-Pierre Paclet, physician of Les Bleus in 1998, mentions &quot;abnormal haematocrit values&quot; in his book. Gary Neville, former English international, recalled that &quot;some of the players started taking injections from (...) a Frenchman called Dr Rougier&quot;. After some felt an energy boost, there was &quot;a queue to see the doctor before the Argentina match&quot;.

=== Football Clubs ===
In the 1960s, Inter Milan has its greatest period of success known as &quot;[La] Grande Inter&quot; (&quot;Great Inter&quot;), achieved when Helenio Herrera was their manager. He won seven trophies with the club. In 2004, Ferruccio Mazzola, Inter player during that period, accused him of distributing performance-enhancing drugs, including amphetamines, among the team players, especially the substitute players &quot;who often served as guinea pigs for trying new pills and see if they worked.&quot; When he found out that some in the team were spitting them out, he dissolved them in coffee to make sure they were consumed, a practice known as &quot;Caffè di Herrera&quot; (&quot;Herrera&#x27;s Coffee&quot;). In 2010, Inter sued Mazzola but lost the case, the court believed him. One of the reasons he spoke up were the serious medical conditions and/or deaths of some of his former members: Giuliano Taccola, then team&#x27;s captain Armando Picchi (died aged 36 due to cancer), Marcello Giusti, Carlo Tagnin, Mauro Bicicli, Ferdinando Miniussi, Enea Masiero and Pino Longoni. He suspected the drugs to be the cause of their sufferings. in 2015, his brother Sandro, who denied everything at the beginning, admitted that the incidents happened.

In the 1970s performance-enhancing drugs were used on a regular basis according to witnesses of that period, mostly in Ajax, Feyenoord and AZ Alkmaar during competitive matches, including the 1970 and 1972 Intercontinental Cups won by the first two cited clubs. Jan Peters recounted drug use before the big games. They seemed to work as he felt energy boosts and euphoria. Johnny Rep, former Ajax player, claimed that &quot;everyone was on something&quot;. He recounted injections for everyone on 1 November 1979, ahead of a match of his team, Saint-Etienne, against PSV Eindhoven. Pierre Poty, who was physician of the club at that time, also revealed that he worked with uppers and reasoned it with the fantastic effects. Fritz Kessel, also physician, worked for the Dutch national side for 30 years and revealed that drugs were common in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups. He said that to Guido Derksen, writer of &quot;Voetbal Myseries&quot;, who wrote that players &quot;consumed tons of amphetamines.&quot;

An investigative commission of sports medicine in Freiburg claims that in the late 1970s and in the 1980s Stuttgart and Freiburg football clubs were operating with Anabolika. VfB Stuttgart reordered Anabolika at least once.

In 1987, Toni Schumacher wrote about a long-running tradition of doping in the Bundesliga, claiming that lots of players were taking Captagon. He himself experimented with it and the effects were: Increased aggression, lower pain threshold, increased focus, confidence and endurance. The by effect was sleeping problems. In Köln he was chauffeuring his colleagues to the doctor who gave them pills and injections, presumably anabolics and stimulants. In the national team he mentioned a &quot;walking chemist&quot; and hormone use. Despite being supported by Paul Breitner he had to leave Köln after 544 games. Later on, his statements about doping in the Bundesliga were supported by Per Roentved, Hans Werner Moors, Dieter Schatzscheider, Hans-Josef Kapellmann, Peter Neururer, Benno Möhlmann, Uwe Nester, Peter Geyer (who talked about procedure, quantity and side effects), Jürgen Röber, Jürgen Stumm and Peter Harms (both medics).

Juventus won the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final, but the victory remains controversial because of accusations of doping. The Juventus team has been accused of using erythropoietin (EPO) and the matter went to trial in 2004. In November 2004, club doctor Riccardo Agricola was given a 22-month prison sentence and fined €2,000 for sporting fraud by providing performance-enhancing drugs, specifically EPO, to players between 1994 and 1998, Leading hematologist Giuseppe d&#x27;Onofrio said that it was &quot;practically certain&quot; that midfielders Antonio Conte and Alessio Tacchinardi had taken EPO to overcome brief bouts of anemia, and that it was &quot;very probable&quot; that seven other players – Alessandro Birindelli, Alessandro Del Piero, Didier Deschamps, Dimas, Paolo Montero, Gianluca Pessotto and Moreno Torricelli – had taken EPO in small doses. In April 2005, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave the following advisory opinion, in part: &quot;The use of pharmaceutical substances which are not expressly prohibited by sports law, and which cannot be considered as substances similar or related to those expressly prohibited, is not to be sanctioned by disciplinary measures. However, regardless of the existence or not of any judgement rendered by a State court, sports authorities are under the obligation to prosecute the use of pharmaceutical substances which are prohibited by sports law or any other anti-doping rule violation in order to adopt disciplinary measures.&quot; In December 2005, Agricola was acquitted of the charges by Turin&#x27;s court of appeal. In March 2007, in the final verdict by the Supreme Court of Cassation, stated: &quot;that in the years of 1994 to 1998 there was no ascertained positive case of doping substances by Juventus players, that the purchase of erythropoietin or its administration to the athletes of the club does not emerge from any act of the trial, and that the same expert had identified the possibility of an administration of erythropoietin in distant terms from the sure evidence (&quot;very probable&quot; and in two cases &quot;practically certain&quot;): it is that therefore, the judgement of probability and not of certainty, did not allow for a statement of responsibility.&quot; The verdict also went on to say: &quot;In response to the conclusion taken, the territorial court notes that there were no deferred values higher than the limits set in the various antidoping protocols and that the situation of the Juventus players, both with reference to the average hematological values, and in relation to that of material balance, did not differ from the national average population.

At Olympique Marseille, doping also took place according to Marcel Desailly, Jean-Jaques Eydelie, Chris Waddle and Tony Cascarino. They told about stimulants taken prior to their big games, which made them more energetic and keen. According to Eydelie, &quot;all (of them) took a series of injections&quot; in the Champions League Final 1993, except Rudi Völler. All this was no surprise for Arsene Wenger, who said everyone in France assumed something like that going on. Additionally, Desailly and Cascarino claimed that Bernard Tapie, the president himself, distributed pills and injections. Author Mondenard also mentioned &quot;injections for everyone&quot;. Tapie only admitted that some players took Captagon.

In 2001, a couple of players tested positive for nandrolone.

2013 it had been announced that Fuentes received up to €327,000 annually from Real Sociedad. This was detected by auditors from Ernst &amp; Young at the behest of Iñaki Badiola, president of the club in 2008. The documentation of the doctor also contained the inscriptions &quot;RSOC&quot; a couple of times and &quot;Cuentas [bills] Asti&quot; which most probably stands for Astiazarán, president of the club from 2000 to 2005. In 2003 Real Sociedad finished second in the Spanish League, missing the title by two points. The well-known medic was hired by Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, too, according to Le Monde. They had access to confidential documents like training schedules.

== Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) ==
In December 2013, the UFC began a campaign to drug test their entire roster randomly all year-round. Random testing, however, became problematic for the promotion as it began to affect revenue, as fighters who had tested positive would need to be taken out of fights, which adversely affected fight cards, and therefore pay-per-view sales. If the UFC were not able to find a replacement fighter fights would have to be cancelled. According to Steven Marrocco of MMAjunkie.com, about 31% of UFC fighters subjected to random testing since the program first started have failed due to using performance-enhancing drugs. That is approximately five failed tests for every sixteen random screenings.

From July 2015, the UFC has advocated to all commissions that every fighter be tested in competition for every card. Lorenzo Feritta, who at the time was one of the presidents of the UFC, said, &quot;We want 100 percent of the fighters tested the night they compete&quot;. Also, in addition to the drug testing protocols in place for competitors on fight night, the UFC conducts additional testing for main event fighters or any fighters that are due to compete in championship matches. This includes enhanced, random &#x27;out of competition&#x27; testing for performance-enhancing drugs, with both urine and blood samples being taken. The UFC also announced that all potential UFC signees would be subject to mandatory pre-contract screening for performance-enhancing drugs prior to being offered a contract with the promotion.

==Endurance sports==
The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport has become an increasing problem across a wide range of sports. It is defined as any substance or drug that, when taken, gives an athlete an unfair advantage relative to a &quot;clean&quot; athlete. The banning of these drugs promotes a level playing field and equality among athletes. The use of &#x27;the suit&#x27; in swimming, which gives athletes an advantage in the way of hydrodynamics, has been banned from international competition due to the unfair advantage it delivered. The drugs taken by athletes differ widely based on the performance needs of the sport.

Erythropoietin (EPO) is largely taken by endurance athletes who seek a higher level of red blood cells, which leads to more oxygenated blood, and a higher VO2 max. An athlete&#x27;s VO2 max is highly correlated with success within endurance sports such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. EPO has recently become prevalent amongst endurance athletes due to its potency and low degree of detectability when compared to other methods of doping such as blood transfusion. While EPO is believed to have been widely used by athletes in the 1990s, there was not a way to directly test for the drug until 2002 as there was no specific screening process to test athletes . Athletes at the Olympic Games are tested for EPO through blood and urine tests. Stringent guidelines and regulations can lessen the danger of doping that has existed within some endurance sports.

===Cycling===
====&quot;The Convicts of the Road&quot;====
In 1924, a journalist Albert Londres followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot;. At Coutances he heard that the previous year&#x27;s winner, Henri Pélissier, his brother Francis and a third rider, Maurice Ville, had resigned from the competition after an argument with the organiser Henri Desgrange. Pélissier explained the problem—whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey—and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres&#x27; race diary, in which he invented the phrase &quot;Les Forçats de la Route&quot; (&quot;The Convicts of the Road&quot;):

:&quot;You have no idea what the Tour de France is,&quot; Henri said. &quot;It&#x27;s a Calvary. Worse than that, because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here...&quot; He pulled a phial from his bag. &quot;That&#x27;s cocaine, for our eyes. This is chloroform, for our gums.&quot;

:&quot;This,&quot; Ville said, emptying his shoulder bag &quot;is liniment to put warmth back into our knees.&quot;

:&quot;And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, here are the pills.&quot; Each pulled out three boxes.

:&quot;The truth is,&quot; Francis said, &quot;that we keep going on dynamite.&quot;

Henri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by diarrhea, before continuing:

:&quot;At night, in our rooms, we can&#x27;t sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing St Vitus&#x27;s Dance...&quot;

:&quot;There&#x27;s less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton,&quot; Francis said.

Francis Pélissier said much later: &quot;Londres was a famous reporter but he didn&#x27;t know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic.&quot; The acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, Henri Desgrange, reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided. The use of Pot Belge by road cyclists in continental Europe exemplifies a cross-over between recreational and performance-enhancing abuse of drugs by sportsman.

====Festina affair====

In 1998, the entire Festina team were excluded from the Tour de France following the discovery of a team car containing large amounts of various performance-enhancing drugs. The team director later admitted that some of the cyclists were routinely given banned substances. Six other teams pulled out in protest including Dutch team TVM who left the tour still being questioned by the police. The Festina scandal overshadowed cyclist Marco Pantani&#x27;s tour win, but he himself later failed a test. The infamous &quot;Pot Belge&quot; or &quot;Belgian mix&quot; has a decades-long history in pro cycling, among both riders and support staff. David Millar, the 2003 World-Time Trial Champion, admitted using EPO, and was stripped of his title and suspended for two years. Roberto Heras was stripped of his victory in the 2005 Vuelta a España and suspended for two years after testing positive for EPO.

====Floyd Landis====
Floyd Landis was the initial winner of the 2006 Tour de France. But a urine sample taken from Landis immediately after his Stage 17 win has twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. The International Cycling Union stripped him of his 2006 Tour de France title. Second place finisher Óscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner.

====Lance Armstrong case====

Lance Armstrong was world number one in 1996. In the same year he recovered from severe testicular cancer and continued to break records and win his seventh Tour de France in 2005. After beating cancer and breaking records he was accused of doping. Teammates of Lance had been caught taking EPO (Erythropoietin), which made the accusations against Armstrong stronger.

On 22 October 2012 Lance Armstrong was officially stripped of his Tour de France titles since 1 August 1998. As a response to the decisions of the USADA and UCI, Armstrong resigned from the Lance Armstrong Foundation. He later admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

===Other endurance sports===
In triathlon, 2004 Hawaii Ironman winner Nina Kraft, was disqualified for a positive test to EPO. She remains the only Hawaii Ironman winner to be disqualified for doping offences. Sports lawyer Michelle Gallen has said that the pursuit of doping athletes has turned into a modern-day witch-hunt.

==Non-endurance sports==

In sports where physical strength is favored, athletes have used anabolic steroids, known for their ability to increase physical strength and muscle mass. The drugs mimic the effect of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the body. They were developed after Eastern Bloc countries demonstrated success in weightlifting during the 1940s. At the time they were using testosterone, which carried with it negative side effects, and anabolic steroids were developed as a solution. The drugs have been used across a wide range of sports from football and basketball to weightlifting and track and field. While not as life-threatening as the drugs used in endurance sports, anabolic steroids have negative side effects, including:

===Side effects in men===
* Acne
* Impaired liver function
* Impotency
* Breast formation (Gynecomastia)
* Increase in oestrogen
* Suppression of spermatogenesis: As endogenous testosterone is the major regulator of the HPG axis, the exogenous testosterone and androgen anabolic steroids exert a suppressive effect of LH and FSH, leading to a decrease in intratesticular and secreted testosterone, decrease in spermatogenesis and sperm production.
* Lack of libido and erectile dysfunction: especially occurs in those men abusing aromatisable androgen anabolic steroids, resulting in high oestrogen levels. Although physiological levels of oestrogens are necessary for normal sexual function, the high doses and the imbalance between testosterone and estradiol appear to be the cause of sexual dysfunction.
* Increased sex drive
* Male pattern baldness
* Risk of heart failure

===Side effects in women===
* Hair loss
* Male pattern baldness
* Hypertrophy of the clitoris
* Increased sex drive
* Irregularities of the menstrual cycle
* Development of masculine facial traits
* Increased coarseness of the skin
* Premature closure of the epiphysis
* Deepening of the voice

In countries where the use of these drugs is controlled, there is often a black market trade of smuggled or counterfeit drugs. The quality of these drugs may be poor and can cause health risks. In countries where anabolic steroids are strictly regulated, some have called for regulatory relief. Anabolic steroids are available over-the-counter in some countries such as Thailand and Mexico.

Sports that are members of the IOC also enforce drug regulations; for example bridge.

==Reaction from sports organizations==
Many sports organizations have banned the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict rules and penalties for people who are caught using them. The International Amateur Athletic Federation, now World Athletics, was the first international governing body of sport to take the situation seriously. In 1928 they banned participants from doping, but with little in the way of testing available they had to rely on the word of the athlete that they were clean.
It was not until 1966 that FIFA and Union Cycliste Internationale (cycling) joined the IAAF in the fight against drugs, followed by the International Olympic Committee the following year. Progression in pharmacology has always outstripped the ability of sports federations to implement rigorous testing procedures but since the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency in 1999, it has become more effective to catch athletes who use drugs. The first tests for athletes were at the 1966 European Championships and two years later the IOC implemented their first drug tests at both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Anabolic steroids became prevalent during the 1970s and after a method of detection was found they were added to the IOC&#x27;s prohibited substances list in 1975, after which the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal were the first Olympic games which tested for them.

Over the years, different sporting bodies have evolved differently in the struggle against doping. Some, such as athletics and cycling, are becoming increasingly vigilant against doping. However, there has been criticism that sports such as football (soccer) and baseball are doing nothing about the issue, and letting athletes implicated in doping get away unpunished.

Some commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. A common rebuttal to this argument asserts that anti-doping efforts have been largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, and so sanctioned steroid use would not be markedly different from the situation already in existence.

Another point of view is that doping could be legalized to some extent using a drug whitelist and medical counseling, such that medical safety is ensured, with all usage published. Under such a system, it is likely that athletes would attempt to cheat by exceeding official limits to try to gain an advantage; this could be considered conjecture as drug amounts do not always correlate linearly with performance gains.

== The influence of others ==

=== Social pressures ===
Social pressure is one of the factors that leads to doping in sport. The media and society work together to construct a view of what masculinity and femininity should look like. Adolescent athletes are constantly influenced by what they see on the media, and some go to extreme measures to achieve the ideal image since society channels Judith Butler&#x27;s definition of gender as a performative act. Examples of social pressures were given in a study done on an online bodybuilding community where bodybuilders doped because they felt like it was a rite of passage to be accepted into the community, and to feel validated. Both men and women are being materialized in the context of doping in sport; in an interview involving 140 men, it was concluded that &quot;bodily practices are essential for masculine identity,&quot; and it was determined that the media highly publicizes female athletes who were strong, and thin. This leads to the issue of the consumption of performance enhancement drugs to achieve muscular or thin figures, and the assumption that the opponents are also taking performance-enhancing drugs, deeming it as an acceptable behavior to conform to. In addition, society&#x27;s embracement of the &quot;winning is everything&quot; spirit leads many athletes to participate in doping, hoping that they will not be caught.

=== Physical pressures ===
Elite athletes have financial competitive motivations that cause them to dope and these motivations differ from that of recreational athletes. The common theme among these motivations is the pressure to physically perform. In a study of 101 individuals, 86% responded that their use of performance enhancement drugs were influenced by the potential athletic success, 74% by the economic aspect, and 30% by self-confidence and social recognition related reasons. In another study of 40 people, it was concluded that athletes used performance enhancement drugs for healing purposes so that they were an able competitor for the economic rewards involved with elite sports. Physical pressures often overlap with social pressures to have a certain body build. This is the case with muscle dysmorphia, where an athlete wants a more muscular physique for functionality and self- image purposes. The most popular motive for athletes to take supplements is to prevent any nutrient deficiencies and to strengthen the immune system. These factors all focus on improving the body for performance.

=== Psychological motivations ===
Psychology is another factor to take into consideration in doping in sport. It becomes a behavioral issue when the athlete acknowledges the health risks associated with doping, yet participates in it anyway. This has to do with the psychological thinking that the drug will make one feel invincible. The individuals are very egotistic in their way of thinking and their motivation is dependent on the performance enhancement drug since they believe that it delivers the results. On a study on health psychology, Quirk points out three different psychological aspects that lead one to dope: social cognition, stress and strain, and addiction. The social and physical pressures can alter an athlete&#x27;s way of thinking, leading them to believe that they must take performance enhancement drugs since everyone else is doing it, known as &quot;the doping dilemma.&quot;This also causes athletes to be hesitant to consult with a doctor about their steroid use, putting themselves at more risk with health problems.

==Anti-doping organizations and legislation==
* In 1999, initiated by the International Olympic Committee to fight against doping in sport, the World Anti-Doping Agency had been founded. After the doping scandal in cycling in the summer 1998 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to establish the WADA to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight of against doping in sport. The headquarters for WADA is in Montreal, Canada. The WADA is the supreme international authority and is allowed to do doping tests and can determine which substances are illegal.
* In February 2011, the United States Olympic Committee and the Ad Council launched an anti-steroid campaign called Play Asterisk Free aimed at teens. The campaign first launched in 2008 under the name &quot;Don&#x27;t Be An Asterisk!&quot;.
* In October 2012, the USADA released evidence to corroborate their doping claim against cyclist Lance Armstrong. According to USADA CEO Travis T. Tygart, the evidence against Armstrong includes, &quot;...scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance enhancing drugs&quot;.
* On 1 November 1989, US Senator Joseph Biden introduced S. 1829, The Steroid Trafficking Act of 1989. The purpose of the act was simple: It would &quot;amend the Controlled Substances Act to further restrict the use of steroids. By designating anabolic steroids as a Schedule II controlled substance, the bill would crack down on illegal steroid use&quot;. (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2002, p. 282).
* In January 2021, The government of Kenya unanimously passed the anti-doping bill into law that will enable the country to comply with the World 2021 anti-doping code.
* In April 2021, The US Senate passes the &quot;United States Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization Act of 2021&quot; to reauthorize the United States Doping Agency. 

==Test methods==

=== Urine test ===
Under established doping control protocols, the athlete will be asked to provide a urine sample, which will be divided into two, each portion to be preserved within sealed containers bearing the same unique identifying number and designation respectively as A- and B-samples. An athlete whose A-sample has tested positive for a prohibited substance is requested an analysis of his or her B-sample after a confirmation test on sample A that delivered the same results. If the B-sample test results match the A-sample results, then the athlete is considered to have a positive test, otherwise, the test results are negative. This confirmation process ensures the safety of the individual.

=== Blood test ===
&quot;see also:&quot; blood doping

The blood test detects illegal performance enhancement drugs through the measurement of indicators that change with the use of recombinant human erythropoietin:

# Hematocrit
# Reticulocytes
# Level of Iron

=== Gas chromatography-combustion-IRMS ===
The gas chromatography-combustion-IRMS is a way to detect any variations in the isotopic composition of an organic compound from the standard. This test is used to detect whether or not synthetic testosterone was consumed, leading to an increased abnormal testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) level.

Assumptions:
* 98.9% of the carbon atoms in nature are 12C
* the remaining 1.1% are 13C

The lower the13C to12C ratio, the more likely that synthetic testosterone was used.

=== Athlete biological passport ===
The athlete biological passport is a program that tracks the location of an athlete to combat doping in sports. This means that the athlete can be monitored and drug tested wherever they are and this data can be compared to the history of their doping test results. There is an ongoing discussion about how this measure can be seen as a violation of an individual&#x27;s privacy.

===Retesting of samples===
According to Article 6.5 in the World Anti-Doping Code samples may be retested later. Samples from high-profile events, such as the Olympic Games, are now retested up to eight years later to take advantage of new techniques for detecting banned substances.

===Cheating the tests===
Athletes seeking to avoid testing positive use various methods. The most common methods include:
* Urine replacement, which involves replacing dirty urine with clean urine from someone who is not taking banned substances. Urine replacement can be done by catheterization or with a prosthetic penis such as The Original Whizzinator.
* Diuretics, used to cleanse the system before having to provide a sample (which have also been placed in lists of banned substances themselves to circumvent this practice).
* Blood transfusions, which increase the blood&#x27;s oxygen carrying capacity, in turn increasing endurance without the presence of drugs that could trigger a positive test result.
* To avoid being tested during training periods, athletes can make themselves unavailable. To mitigate this, athletes have to report their location at any time. If intended doping tests could not be done because the athlete could not be found, three times during a year, it&#x27;s considered a doping violation, same as refusing a test. There is a website and a phone app, called ADAMS, in which athletes are expected to report their location.

===Validity===
Donald Berry, writing in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, has called attention to potential problems with the validity of ways in which many of the standardised tests are performed;[&quot;subscription required&quot;] in his article, as described in an accompanying editorial, Berry The editorial closes, saying &quot;Nature believes that accepting &#x27;legal limits&#x27; of specific metabolites without such rigorous verification goes against the foundational standards of modern science, and results in an arbitrary test for which the rate of false positives and false negatives can never be known.&quot;

==Defense==

G. Pascal Zachary argues in a &quot;Wired&quot; essay that legalizing performance-enhancing substances, as well as genetic enhancements once they became available, would satisfy society&#x27;s need for übermenschen and reverse the decline in public interest in sports.

Sports scholar Verner Moller argues that society is hypocritical when it holds athletes to moral standards, but do not conform to those morals themselves. Fox Sports writer Jen Floyd Engel stated in an article, &quot;We live in a pharmacological society. We live in a society of short cuts, of fake this and enhanced that, and somehow we keep trying to sell the line that sports has become this evil empire of cheating. The reality is athletes are merely doing what so many of us do and celebrate and watch every single day of our lives.&quot;

Sociologist Ellis Cashmore argues that what is considered doping is too arbitrary: transfusing blood cells is not allowed, but other methods of boosting blood cell count, such as hypobaric chambers, are allowed. Other scholars have advanced similar arguments.

In 2023, Australian businessman Aron D&#x27;Souza announced the Enhanced Games, a planned sports event permitting doping.

==Legal==
Anti-doping policies instituted by individual sporting governing bodies may conflict with local laws. A notable case includes the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s inability to suspend players found with banned substances, after it was ruled by a federal court that local labor laws superseded the NFL&#x27;s anti-doping regime. The challenge was supported by the National Football League Players Association.

Athletes caught doping may be subject to penalties from their local, as well from the individual sporting, governing body. The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country. Fighters found using performance-enhancing drugs in mixed martial arts competitions (e.g. the UFC) could face civil and/or criminal charges once Bill S-209 passes.

Under certain circumstances, when athletes need to take a prohibited substance to treat a medical condition, therapeutic use exemptions may be granted.

<text>In semiconductor production, doping is the intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic (undoped) semiconductor for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties. The doped material is referred to as an extrinsic semiconductor.

Small numbers of dopant atoms can change the ability of a semiconductor to conduct electricity. When on the order of one dopant atom is added per 100 million atoms, the doping is said to be &quot;low&quot; or &quot;light&quot;. When many more dopant atoms are added, on the order of one per ten thousand atoms, the doping is referred to as &quot;high&quot; or &quot;heavy&quot;. This is often shown as &quot;n+&quot; for n-type doping or &quot;p+&quot; for p-type doping. (&quot;See the article on semiconductors for a more detailed description of the doping mechanism.&quot;) A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a conductor than a semiconductor is referred to as a degenerate semiconductor. A semiconductor can be considered i-type semiconductor if it has been doped in equal quantities of p and n.

In the context of phosphors and scintillators, doping is better known as activation; this is not to be confused with dopant activation in semiconductors. Doping is also used to control the color in some pigments.

==History==
The effects of impurities in semiconductors (doping) were long known empirically in such devices as crystal radio detectors and selenium rectifiers. For instance, in 1885 Shelford Bidwell, and in 1930 the German scientist Bernhard Gudden, each independently reported that the properties of semiconductors were due to the impurities they contained. 
A doping process was formally developed by John Robert Woodyard working at Sperry Gyroscope Company during World War II. Though the word &quot;doping&quot; is not used in it, his US Patent issued in 1950 describes methods for adding tiny amounts of solid elements from the nitrogen column of the periodic table to germanium to produce rectifying devices. The demands of his work on radar prevented Woodyard from pursuing further research on semiconductor doping.

Similar work was performed at Bell Labs by Gordon K. Teal and Morgan Sparks, with a US Patent issued in 1953.

Woodyard&#x27;s prior patent proved to be the grounds of extensive litigation by Sperry Rand.

==Carrier concentration==
The concentration of the dopant used affects many electrical properties. Most important is the material&#x27;s charge carrier concentration. In an intrinsic semiconductor under thermal equilibrium, the concentrations of electrons and holes are equivalent. That is,

:formula_1

In a non-intrinsic semiconductor under thermal equilibrium, the relation becomes (for low doping):

:formula_2

where &quot;n&quot;0 is the concentration of conducting electrons, &quot;p&quot;0 is the conducting hole concentration, and &quot;ni&quot; is the material&#x27;s intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration varies between materials and is dependent on temperature. Silicon&#x27;s &quot;ni&quot;, for example, is roughly 1.08×1010 cm−3 at 300 kelvins, about room temperature.

In general, increased doping leads to increased conductivity due to the higher concentration of carriers. Degenerate (very highly doped) semiconductors have conductivity levels comparable to metals and are often used in integrated circuits as a replacement for metal. Often superscript plus and minus symbols are used to denote relative doping concentration in semiconductors. For example, &quot;n&quot;+ denotes an n-type semiconductor with a high, often degenerate, doping concentration. Similarly, &quot;p&quot;− would indicate a very lightly doped p-type material. Even degenerate levels of doping imply low concentrations of impurities with respect to the base semiconductor. In intrinsic crystalline silicon, there are approximately 5×1022 atoms/cm3. Doping concentration for silicon semiconductors may range anywhere from 1013 cm−3 to 1018 cm−3. Doping concentration above about 1018 cm−3 is considered degenerate at room temperature. Degenerately doped silicon contains a proportion of impurity to silicon on the order of parts per thousand. This proportion may be reduced to parts per billion in very lightly doped silicon. Typical concentration values fall somewhere in this range and are tailored to produce the desired properties in the device that the semiconductor is intended for.

==Effect on band structure==
Doping a semiconductor in a good crystal introduces allowed energy states within the band gap, but very close to the energy band that corresponds to the dopant type. In other words, electron donor impurities create states near the conduction band while electron acceptor impurities create states near the valence band. The gap between these energy states and the nearest energy band is usually referred to as dopant-site bonding energy or &quot;EB&quot; and is relatively small. For example, the &quot;EB&quot; for boron in silicon bulk is 0.045 eV, compared with silicon&#x27;s band gap of about 1.12 eV. Because &quot;EB&quot; is so small, room temperature is hot enough to thermally ionize practically all of the dopant atoms and create free charge carriers in the conduction or valence bands.

Dopants also have the important effect of shifting the energy bands relative to the Fermi level. The energy band that corresponds with the dopant with the greatest concentration ends up closer to the Fermi level. Since the Fermi level must remain constant in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, stacking layers of materials with different properties leads to many useful electrical properties induced by band bending, if the interfaces can be made cleanly enough. For example, the p-n junction&#x27;s properties are due to the band bending that happens as a result of the necessity to line up the bands in contacting regions of p-type and n-type material.
This effect is shown in a band diagram. The band diagram typically indicates the variation in the valence band and conduction band edges versus some spatial dimension, often denoted &quot;x&quot;. The Fermi level is also usually indicated in the diagram. Sometimes the &quot;intrinsic Fermi level&quot;, &quot;Ei&quot;, which is the Fermi level in the absence of doping, is shown. These diagrams are useful in explaining the operation of many kinds of semiconductor devices.

===Relationship to carrier concentration (low doping)===

For low levels of doping, the relevant energy states are populated sparsely by electrons (conduction band) or holes (valence band). It is possible to write simple expressions for the electron and hole carrier concentrations, by ignoring Pauli exclusion (via Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics):

where is the Fermi level, is the minimum energy of the conduction band, and is the maximum energy of the valence band. These are related to the value of the intrinsic concentration via
:formula_4
an expression which is independent of the doping level, since (the band gap) does not change with doping.

The concentration factors and are given by
:formula_5
where and are the density of states effective masses of electrons and holes, respectively, quantities that are roughly constant over temperature.

==Techniques of doping and synthesis==

=== Doping during crystal growth ===

Some dopants are added as the (usually silicon) boule is grown by Czochralski method, giving each wafer an almost uniform initial doping.

Alternately, synthesis of semiconductor devices may involve the use of vapor-phase epitaxy. In vapor-phase epitaxy, a gas containing the dopant precursor can be introduced into the reactor. For example, in the case of n-type gas doping of gallium arsenide, hydrogen sulfide is added, and sulfur is incorporated into the structure. This process is characterized by a constant concentration of sulfur on the surface. In the case of semiconductors in general, only a very thin layer of the wafer needs to be doped in order to obtain the desired electronic properties.

=== Post-growth doping ===

To define circuit elements, selected areas — typically controlled by photolithography — are further doped by such processes as diffusion and ion implantation, the latter method being more popular in large production runs because of increased controllability.

=== Spin-on glass ===
Spin-on glass or spin-on dopant doping is a two-step process. First, a mixture of SiO2 and dopants (in a solvent) is applied to a wafer surface by spin-coating. Then it is stripping and baked at a certain temperature in a furnace with constant nitrogen+oxygen flow.

===Neutron transmutation doping ===

Neutron transmutation doping (NTD) is an unusual doping method for special applications. Most commonly, it is used to dope silicon n-type in high-power electronics and semiconductor detectors. It is based on the conversion of the Si-30 isotope into phosphorus atom by neutron absorption as follows:

formula_6 
In practice, the silicon is typically placed near a nuclear reactor to receive the neutrons. As neutrons continue to pass through the silicon, more and more phosphorus atoms are produced by transmutation, and therefore the doping becomes more and more strongly n-type. NTD is a far less common doping method than diffusion or ion implantation, but it has the advantage of creating an extremely uniform dopant distribution.

==Dopant elements==

===Group IV semiconductors===
(Note: When discussing periodic table groups, semiconductor physicists always use an older notation, not the current IUPAC group notation. For example, the carbon group is called &quot;Group IV&quot;, not &quot;Group 14&quot;.)

For the Group IV semiconductors such as diamond, silicon, germanium, silicon carbide, and silicon–germanium, the most common dopants are acceptors from Group III or donors from Group V elements. Boron, arsenic, phosphorus, and occasionally gallium are used to dope silicon. Boron is the p-type dopant of choice for silicon integrated circuit production because it diffuses at a rate that makes junction depths easily controllable. Phosphorus is typically used for bulk-doping of silicon wafers, while arsenic is used to diffuse junctions, because it diffuses more slowly than phosphorus and is thus more controllable.

By doping pure silicon with Group V elements such as phosphorus, extra valence electrons are added that become unbounded from individual atoms and allow the compound to be an electrically conductive n-type semiconductor. Doping with Group III elements, which are missing the fourth valence electron, creates &quot;broken bonds&quot; (holes) in the silicon lattice that are free to move. The result is an electrically conductive p-type semiconductor. In this context, a Group V element is said to behave as an electron donor, and a Group III element as an acceptor. This is a key concept in the physics of a diode.

A very heavily doped semiconductor behaves more like a good conductor (metal) and thus exhibits more linear positive thermal coefficient. Such effect is used for instance in sensistors. Lower dosage of doping is used in other types (NTC or PTC) thermistors.

===Silicon dopants===
*Acceptors, p-type
**Boron is a p-type dopant. Its diffusion rate allows easy control of junction depths. Common in CMOS technology. Can be added by diffusion of diborane gas. The only acceptor with sufficient solubility for efficient emitters in transistors and other applications requiring extremely high dopant concentrations. Boron diffuses about as fast as phosphorus.
**Aluminum, used for deep p-diffusions. Not popular in VLSI and ULSI. Also a common unintentional impurity.
**Gallium is a dopant used for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 8–14 μm atmospheric window. Gallium-doped silicon is also promising for solar cells, due to its long minority carrier lifetime with no lifetime degradation; as such it is gaining importance as a replacement of boron doped substrates for solar cell applications.
**Indium is a dopant used for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors in the 3–5 μm atmospheric window.
*Donors, n-type
**Phosphorus is a n-type dopant. It diffuses fast, so is usually used for bulk doping, or for well formation. Used in solar cells. Can be added by diffusion of phosphine gas. Bulk doping can be achieved by nuclear transmutation, by irradiation of pure silicon with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Phosphorus also traps gold atoms, which otherwise quickly diffuse through silicon and act as recombination centers.
**Arsenic is a n-type dopant. Its slower diffusion allows using it for diffused junctions. Used for buried layers. Has similar atomic radius to silicon, high concentrations can be achieved. Its diffusivity is about a tenth of phosphorus or boron, so it is used where the dopant should stay in place during subsequent thermal processing. Useful for shallow diffusions where well-controlled abrupt boundary is desired. Preferred dopant in VLSI circuits. Preferred dopant in low resistivity ranges.
**Antimony is a n-type dopant. It has a small diffusion coefficient. Used for buried layers. Has diffusivity similar to arsenic, is used as its alternative. Its diffusion is virtually purely substitutional, with no interstitials, so it is free of anomalous effects. For this superior property, it is sometimes used in VLSI instead of arsenic. Heavy doping with antimony is important for power devices. Heavily antimony-doped silicon has lower concentration of oxygen impurities; minimal autodoping effects make it suitable for epitaxial substrates.
**Bismuth is a promising dopant for long-wavelength infrared photoconduction silicon detectors, a viable n-type alternative to the p-type gallium-doped material.
**Lithium is used for doping silicon for radiation hardened solar cells. The lithium presence anneals defects in the lattice produced by protons and neutrons. Lithium can be introduced to boron-doped p+ silicon, in amounts low enough to maintain the p character of the material, or in large enough amount to counterdope it to low-resistivity n type.
*Other
**Germanium can be used for band gap engineering. Germanium layer also inhibits diffusion of boron during the annealing steps, allowing ultrashallow p-MOSFET junctions. Germanium bulk doping suppresses large void defects, increases internal gettering, and improves wafer mechanical strength.
**Silicon, germanium and xenon can be used as ion beams for pre-amorphization of silicon wafer surfaces. Formation of an amorphous layer beneath the surface allows forming ultrashallow junctions for p-MOSFETs.
**Nitrogen is important for growing defect-free silicon crystal. Improves mechanical strength of the lattice, increases bulk microdefect generation, suppresses vacancy agglomeration.
**Gold and platinum are used for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.

==Compensation==
In most cases many types of impurities will be present in the resultant doped semiconductor. If an equal number of donors and acceptors are present in the semiconductor, the extra core electrons provided by the former will be used to satisfy the broken bonds due to the latter, so that doping produces no free carriers of either type. This phenomenon is known as &quot;compensation&quot;, and occurs at the p-n junction in the vast majority of semiconductor devices.

Partial compensation, where donors outnumber acceptors or vice versa, allows device makers to repeatedly reverse (invert) the type of a certain layer under the surface of a bulk semiconductor by diffusing or implanting successively higher doses of dopants, so-called counterdoping. Most modern semiconductor devices are made by successive selective counterdoping steps to create the necessary P and N type areas under the surface of bulk silicon. This is an alternative to successively growing such layers by epitaxy.

Although compensation can be used to increase or decrease the number of donors or acceptors, the electron and hole mobility is always decreased by compensation because mobility is affected by the sum of the donor and acceptor ions.

==Doping in conductive polymers==
Conductive polymers can be doped by adding chemical reactants to oxidize, or sometimes reduce, the system so that electrons are pushed into the conducting orbitals within the already potentially conducting system. There are two primary methods of doping a conductive polymer, both of which use an oxidation-reduction (i.e., redox) process.
# Chemical doping involves exposing a polymer such as melanin, typically a thin film, to an oxidant such as iodine or bromine. Alternatively, the polymer can be exposed to a reductant; this method is far less common, and typically involves alkali metals.
# Electrochemical doping involves suspending a polymer-coated, working electrode in an electrolyte solution in which the polymer is insoluble along with separate counter and reference electrodes. An electric potential difference is created between the electrodes that causes a charge and the appropriate counter ion from the electrolyte to enter the polymer in the form of electron addition (i.e., n-doping) or removal (i.e., p-doping).

N-doping is much less common because the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is oxygen-rich, thus creating an oxidizing environment. An electron-rich, n-doped polymer will react immediately with elemental oxygen to &quot;de-dope&quot; (i.e., reoxidize to the neutral state) the polymer. Thus, chemical n-doping must be performed in an environment of inert gas (e.g., argon). Electrochemical n-doping is far more common in research, because it is easier to exclude oxygen from a solvent in a sealed flask. However, it is unlikely that n-doped conductive polymers are available commercially.

== Doping in organic molecular semiconductors ==
Molecular dopants are preferred in doping molecular semiconductors due to their compatibilities of processing with the host, that is, similar evaporation temperatures or controllable solubility. Additionally, the relatively large sizes of molecular dopants compared with those of metal ion dopants (such as Li+ and Mo6+) are generally beneficial, yielding excellent spatial confinement for use in multilayer structures, such as OLEDs and Organic solar cells. Typical p-type dopants include F4-TCNQ and Mo(tfd)3. However, similar to the problem encountered in doping conductive polymers, air-stable n-dopants suitable for materials with low electron affinity (EA) are still elusive. Recently, photoactivation with a combination of cleavable dimeric dopants, such as [RuCp∗Mes]2, suggests a new path to realize effective n-doping in low-EA materials.

==Magnetic doping==

Research on magnetic doping has shown that considerable alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity; for example, dopant impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys can generate different properties as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl and Nakamura.
The inclusion of dopant elements to impart dilute magnetism is of growing significance in the field of magnetic semiconductors. The presence of disperse ferromagnetic species is key to the functionality of emerging spintronics, a class of systems that utilise electron spin in addition to charge. Using density functional theory (DFT) the temperature dependent magnetic behaviour of dopants within a given lattice can be modeled to identify candidate semiconductor systems.

== Single dopants in semiconductors ==
The sensitive dependence of a semiconductor&#x27;s properties on dopants has provided an extensive range of tunable phenomena to explore and apply to devices. It is possible to identify the effects of a solitary dopant on commercial device performance as well as on the fundamental properties of a semiconductor material. New applications have become available that require the discrete character of a single dopant, such as single-spin devices in the area of quantum information or single-dopant transistors. Dramatic advances in the past decade towards observing, controllably creating and manipulating single dopants, as well as their application in novel devices have allowed opening the new field of solotronics (solitary dopant optoelectronics).

==Modulation doping ==
Electrons or holes introduced by doping are mobile, and can be spatially separated from dopant atoms they have dissociated from. Ionized donors and acceptors however attract electrons and holes, respectively, so this spatial separation requires abrupt changes of dopant levels, of band gap (e.g. a quantum well), or built-in electric fields (e.g. in case of noncentrosymmetric crystals). This technique is called modulation doping and is advantageous owing to suppressed carrier-donor scattering, allowing very high mobility to be attained.

<doc id="860873" wikidata="Q873304" url="?curid=860873" title="GK Wien–Southeast">
<text>The GK Vienna–Southeast was a back-to-back HVDC station linking the electric power grids of Austria and Hungary. It operated between June 1993 and October 1996.

==Facility==

This facility was built by Siemens and had a maximum transfer power of 600 MW with an operation voltage of 142 kV. In great extent, it was identical with the HVDC back-to-back station in Etzenricht, which was used for coupling the power grids of Bavaria and Czech and built at the same time. As in this installation, the inverters used 864 thyristors. However, at GK Vienna-Southeast were not used as in the HVDC back-to-back station in Etzenricht six single-phase transformers, but four three-phase transformers.
While the facility in Etzenricht got obsolete in 1995 after synchronisation of power grids in Western and Eastern Europe, GK Vienna-Southeast remained in service at first, because the direct interconnection of power grids of Austria and Hungary would have caused regulation-technical problems as result of the missing national 380 kV grid in Austria.

These problems were solved in 1996 with the installation of frequency regulation equipment in coal-fired power stations in Southern Poland, so GK Vienna Southeast GK got unessential in October 1996 and was shut down.

The shut-down of GK Vienna-Southeast increased the maximum transfer power of the 380 kV line Vienna southeast – Győr to 1514 MW.

After its shut-down, it was planned to dismantle GK Vienna-Southeast and rebuild it in East Europe at a location close to the border to the CIS countries for the realization of an interconnection between the power grid of central Europe and the CIS countries. However, that was not done and so the installation was dismantled in 2007–08.

However, one of the harmonic waves filter was preserved as a monument.

On the site, a new building for the control centre of the power grid of Austria was built. The static inverter hall was not demolished, but turned into a workshop.

At the third (before decommissioning of GK Wien–Southeast second) pylon, which is situated 260 metres south of the area of GK Wien–Southeast, the 26-kilometre-long line section starts, where it is together with the two 380 kV circuits of the powerline to Stixneusiedl substation installed on the same pylons. Stixneusiedl substation is passed by the line approximately 50 metres southwards. After a further 37.5 kilometres, the line passes the border to Hungary. At the beginning of 2010, the second 380 V circuit of the line was installed, for which the pylons of the whole line are already designed.
This circuit branches near Ötteveny in direction southwest toward Szombathely substation.

He is best known for his roles as Terry Collier in &quot;The Likely Lads&quot; and its sequel &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, Jack Ford in &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;, Roy Figgis in &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, Trevor Chaplin in &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot;, Arthur Gilder in &quot;Born and Bred&quot;, Jack Halford in &quot;New Tricks&quot; and the title character of Grandpa in the CBeebies programme &quot;Grandpa in My Pocket&quot;. He also played the serial killer Harold Shipman in the ITV drama &quot;Shipman&quot; and portrayed Harold Wilson in the BBC documentary &quot;The Plot Against Harold Wilson&quot;.

For &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, Bolam was twice nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor in 1977 and 1978 and in 1995 he was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; at The Donmar Warehouse.

==Early life==
Bolam was born on 16 June 1935 in Sunderland, County Durham. His father, Robert Alfred Bolam, was from Northumberland, and his mother, Marion Alice Drury, from County Durham. After attending Bede Grammar School, Sunderland, Bolam attended Bemrose School in Derby. Bolam trained as an articled clerk to a chartered accountant, before becoming an actor, and formally trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama, London, where he won the gold medal and the Margaret Rawlings Cup. Lacking funding for his fees, he worked in Lyons Corner House tearoom and West End restaurants, washing dishes at night and studying during the day.

Bolam&#x27;s first professional engagement was at the Royal Court Theatre as an understudy to Ronnie Barker in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Platonov&quot;. He first appeared on screens in the early 1960s, initially in television shows such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and the Northern social realist films &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (both 1962), in the latter film as the best friend of the title character (played by Tom Courtenay).

It was &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, with Bolam as Terry Collier and Rodney Bewes as Bob Ferris, which made Bolam a star during its 1964 to 1966 run and he adapted the scripts for a BBC Radio version soon afterwards. He appeared with John Thaw in the Granada serial, &quot;Inheritance&quot; in 1967.

Before the sequel, &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;, began its run, Bolam appeared in films such as &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; (1967), &quot;Otley&quot; (1969), and &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973). The revived series, chronicling the further adventures of Bob and Terry, lasted for two series broadcast in 1973 and 1974 and a 45-minute 1974 Christmas Eve special.

In 1975, Bolam appeared alongside the original cast in a further BBC Radio series adapted from the 1973 TV series and in 1976 there was a reunion in a feature film spin-off from the series, simply entitled &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;. Bolam&#x27;s co-star Rodney Bewes stated in 2005 that the two actors had not spoken since the film had been made, a period of over thirty years. The rift, according to Bewes, developed through his indiscreetly telling a journalist that when Bolam&#x27;s wife revealed she was pregnant, Bolam was so startled that the car he was driving mounted a pavement and almost crashed into a lamp post. Bolam denied there was a rift between the two men when Bewes died in November 2017, claiming that they &quot;didn&#x27;t talk for 40 years because of their busy schedules rather than resentment&quot;.

Bolam is known for being guarded about his private life. He once remarked: &quot;I&#x27;m having a man fix the track rods on my car. I don&#x27;t want to know anything about him. Why should he want to know anything about me?&quot;

In 1976, Bolam returned to straight drama; he played Jack Ford in the BBC Television series &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot;, which ran until 1981. Since then, he has mostly appeared in comedies and comedy dramas, including &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot; (as Roy Figgis) from 29 October 1979 to 16 December 1982, &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; (as Trevor Chaplin) in 1985, &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; in 1987, &quot;Andy Capp&quot; (in the title role), &quot;The Beiderbecke Connection&quot; in 1988, &quot;Second Thoughts&quot; (as Bill MacGregor) from 3 May 1991 to 14 October 1994, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Pay and Display&quot;, &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, &quot;Close and True&quot;, &quot;Born and Bred&quot; (as Dr Arthur Gilder), and &quot;New Tricks&quot; (as Jack Halford). Another memorable role was alongside Timothy West and Sheila Hancock in the 2002 series of the BBC comedy-drama &quot;Bedtime&quot;, in which Bolam played the seemingly decent but actually crooked Ronnie Stribling.

On radio, in 1978, he played Willie Garvin in a BBC World Service radio adaptation of the Modesty Blaise book &quot;Last Day in Limbo&quot;. He provided the voice for The Tod in the animated film version of &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; (1982). In the mid-1980s, he co-starred in the original radio version of the romantic sitcom &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;, which ran for several series and was subsequently adapted for television with Bolam reprising his role. In the year 2000 he played Sir Archibald Flint in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;The Spectre of Lanyon Moor&quot;. He was also the narrator for the three-part football documentary &quot;Three Lions&quot;, which aired before Euro 2000 on BBC One. The three episodes were about England&#x27;s National Team&#x27;s history from the 1966 World Cup until before the Euro 2000 finals.

In 2002, Bolam played the serial killer Harold Shipman in &quot;Shipman&quot;, the ITV adaptation of Brian Whittle and Jean Ritchie&#x27;s book on the case, &quot;Prescription for Murder&quot; and Father Leonard Tibbings in &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot; (Ser. 7, Ep. 1 &#x27;Sins of the Fathers&#x27;). He portrayed Harold Wilson, the former Prime Minister, in the 2006 BBC documentary &quot;The Plot Against Harold Wilson&quot;. He appeared in Frank Loesser&#x27;s musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre during the 2005 summer season. He played the role of Grandpa in the Cbeebies show &quot;Grandpa in My Pocket&quot;. In 2009 he played Ken Lewis, CEO of the Bank of America, in the television dramatisation &quot;The Last Days of Lehman Brothers&quot;. His appearances on the London stage include &quot;Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell&quot; by Keith Waterhouse.

==Personal life==
Bolam lives in Wisborough Green, West Sussex and Chiswick, London, with his wife, actress Susan Jameson. They have one daughter.

Bolam plays golf and is a member of the Stage Golfing Society. In 2013 he campaigned against oil drilling near Wisborough Green, and later appeared in a 2017 video protesting against a proposed extension to oil drilling in West Sussex.

Bolam was appointed MBE in the 2009 Birthday Honours &quot;For services to Drama&quot;.

<doc id="860878" wikidata="Q652618" url="?curid=860878" title="Duck River (Tennessee)">
<text>The Duck River, long, is the longest river located entirely within the U.S. state of Tennessee. Free flowing for most of its length, the Duck River is home to over 50 species of freshwater mussels and 151 species of fish, making it the most biologically diverse river in North America.

The Duck River drains a significant portion of Middle Tennessee. It rises in hills near an area of Middle Tennessee known as the &quot;Barrens&quot;, an area with enough rainfall to support a woodland but which white settlers found already deforested upon their arrival. (Several theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon.) It enters the city of Manchester and meets its confluence with a major tributary, the Little Duck River, at Old Stone Fort State Park, named after an ancient Native American structure between the two rivers believed to be nearly 2,000 years old.

Other major towns along the Duck include Shelbyville, Columbia, and Centerville. Below Shelbyville to the Southeast, the Duck is impounded by Normandy Dam, a Tennessee Valley Authority project of the early 1970s which was built for flood control and recreation. Normandy was not equipped for power generation as were previous TVA dams built in Middle Tennessee. The structure was named for the hamlet of Normandy, which is nearby. The resultant reservoir occupies over of what was previously prime land for agriculture. Further downstream, Shelbyville is protected from potential Duck River flooding by levees and floodgates. A dam constructed by the Tennessee Electric Power Company across the river adjacent to downtown Shelbyville is a relic of the early electrical development of the area prior to the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

Downstream in Maury County is the Yanahli Wildlife Preserve, occupying land which was meant to be another TVA reservoir. The Columbia Dam was never completed, however, when an endangered species of mussel was found in this section of the Duck and studies showed the project costs would far exceed benefits. After years of litigation, the dam, which was largely completed, was dismantled at a loss approaching $80,000,000 of public funds. Another old Tennessee Electric Power Company dam, somewhat similar to the one in downtown Shelbyville, is located downstream of the uncompleted dam site. Private funds have been spent on this dam to rehabilitate it to resume electrical power production; however, this has not proven to be successful. The Duck River frequently floods parts of Columbia, particularly the neighborhoods near downtown.

Between Columbia and Centerville, the Duck cuts through the Western Highland Rim and is joined by several major tributaries, notably the Piney River. Downtown Centerville is located high above the Duck River bottoms. Below Centerville, the Duck again enters a fairly rural, somewhat remote area. Its largest single tributary, the Buffalo River, reaches its confluence with the Duck in southern Humphreys County, just a few miles from the mouth of the Duck into the Tennessee River. The area of the mouth of the Duck is part of the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge.

<text>Oxford Instruments plc is a United Kingdom manufacturing and research company that designs and manufactures tools and systems for industry and research. The company is headquartered in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England, with sites in the United Kingdom, United States, Europe, and Asia. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==

The company was founded by Sir Martin Wood in 1959, with help from his wife Audrey Wood (Lady Wood) to manufacture superconducting magnets for use in scientific research, starting in his garden shed in Northmoor Road, Oxford, England. It was the first substantial commercial spin-out company from the University of Oxford and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1983.

It had a pioneering role in the development of magnetic resonance imaging, providing the first superconducting magnets for this application. The first commercial MRI whole body scanner was manufactured at its Osney Mead factory in Oxford in 1980 for installation at Hammersmith Hospital, London. Further innovations included the development of active shielding, whereby fringe fields hazardous to pacemaker wearers, causing difficulty and expense in siting, were virtually eliminated. Oxford Instruments was not able to capitalise on these inventions itself, granting royalty-free license to Philips and General Electric whilst developing a joint venture with Siemens in 1989: Oxford Instruments sold its 49% shareholding to Siemens in 2003.

<doc id="860892" wikidata="Q716290" url="?curid=860892" title="Tony Frangieh">
<text>Antoine &quot;Tony&quot; Suleiman Frangieh (; 1 September 1941 – 13 June 1978) was a Lebanese politician and militia commander during the early years of the Lebanese Civil War. He was the son of Suleiman Frangieh, a former Lebanese president.

Tony Frangieh was an active participant in Lebanese politics and a member of the Marada Brigade, a Christian militia group that was founded in 1975 by his father.

==Education and early political career==
Frangieh was educated at the College Des Frères Tripoli, first in Tripoli then in Beirut, at the latter from 1958 to 1960. He was furthering his studies before his death.

Frangieh began his career dealing with his family business. On 25 October 1970, he succeeded his father, Suleiman Frangieh, as a member of the Lebanese Parliament for Zgharta, following his father&#x27;s election to the Presidency. He was also appointed the minister of posts and telecommunications in his father&#x27;s government.

==Civil war and death==
At the end of the 1960s, when factions within Lebanon started to form militias, the Frangieh clan formed the Marada Brigade, also known as the Zgharta Liberation Army (ZLA), under the command of Tony Frangieh. The Marada/ZLA mainly operated out of Tripoli and northern Lebanon, the base of the Frangieh family.

The Lebanese Civil War witnessed many shifting alliance, with former allies turning into foes. One such falling out occurred between two of the leading Maronite clans, the Frangiehs and the Gemayels. The Frangiehs, who were close to Syria, were critical of Phalangist Kataeb Regulatory Forces&#x27; militia leader Bachir Gemayel&#x27;s growing alliance with Israel. Militiamen from the Phalange RF and Marada also clashed over protection rackets.

This conflict led to the murder of Tony Frangieh, his wife, Vera (née el Kordahi), and his three-year-old daughter Jihane by Phalangist militiamen, known as the Ehden massacre. His son, Suleiman, was in Beirut during the massacre.

Under cover of darkness on 13 June 1978, a combined force of 1,200 Phalangists led by Elie Hobeika and Samir Geagea, attacked and killed Tony Frangieh and his immediate family, thereby eliminating one of the protagonists vying for political power in the Christian Lebanese community.

After the massacre, Suleiman Frangieh was reported to have been depressed, swearing to take revenge and declaring in an interview &quot;the family will exact its retribution.&quot; However, in a later interview with the Lebanese political channel &#x27;OTV&#x27;, Suleiman Frangieh stated, &quot;That was the past and it must be forgotten, I do not seek revenge because God is the only judge, thus their conscience will haunt them for the rest of their lives.&quot;

Many commentators consider the murder of Tony Frangieh to be one of the factors in the longevity of the Lebanese Civil War and as the starting point of a deep divide between Lebanese Christians. Some 20,000 mourners attended his funeral, including then-Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on 14 June 1978.

==Personal life==
Frangieh had two children, Suleiman Frangieh Jr. and Jihane, with Vera Frangieh, whom he married in 1962. His son Suleiman first became the Minister of Public Health at the age of 22, and later served as the Minister of Interior from 2004 to 2005. He is known to have served with the Marada Brigade in the 1980s.
