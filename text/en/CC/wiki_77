<text>Mary Frances Heflin (September 20, 1920 – June 1, 1994) was an American actress. She is best known for her role as Mona Kane Tyler on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; (1970–1994).

== Early life ==
Heflin was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the daughter of Fanny Bleecker (née Shippey) and Dr. Emmett Evan Heflin, a dentist. She had two older brothers, Martin, a public relations executive, and the actor Van Heflin. Through Martin, she was the aunt of actress Marta Heflin.

== Career ==
Heflin made her Broadway debut in her teens and was later featured in the original productions of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; (1942), &quot;The World&#x27;s Full of Girls&quot; (1943), &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1944), and the U.S. premiere of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot; on July 30, 1947 in Los Angeles. Other Broadway credits included &quot;The Physicists&quot;, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Sheppey&quot;, &quot;All in Favor&quot;, and &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;. She starred in London&#x27;s West End, in John Gielgud&#x27;s UK premiere of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; as Laura opposite Helen Hayes.

Heflin&#x27;s film debut came in &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot; (1970), as she portrayed the wife of a leader of that Irish secret society.

A life member of The Actors Studio, Heflin had varying roles on many television series in the 1950s and 1960s, including small roles on &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;. But her most notable and enduring role was of Mona Kane Tyler, mother of Erica Kane, on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

<text>CFRC-FM (101.9 MHz) is the non-commercial campus radio station at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The station has one of the longest radio histories in Canada, with experimental broadcasts dating back to 1922 and serves Queen&#x27;s University students and faculty as well as the greater Kingston community. CFRC-FM is also a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association.

CFRC-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 3,000 watts. The transmitter is on Station Road in Kingston, near the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway (Ontario Highway 401).

==History==
A comprehensive oral history of the station was compiled by Arthur Zimmerman, which was broadcast on the station in 1982 and was published in book form in 1991.

Radio technology has a surprisingly long history in Kingston, dating back to the early radio experimentations of Queen&#x27;s first Professor of General Engineering, James Lester Willis Gill. He mounted the first public exhibition of wireless telegraphy at a Queen&#x27;s Convocation lecture on April 28, 1902, only four months after Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s first successful trans-Atlantic transmission from Signal Hill. By the 1910s regular courses on wireless technology and theory were being taught by Gill, and Professor Gill set up the Queen&#x27;s wireless telegraph sets at Barriefield war Camp in 1915 and contributed directly to the use of wireless and radio technologies by the Allied forces during World War I.

An informal wireless club was formed by a group of Gill&#x27;s students, who kept experimenting with the latest available wireless technology. With the help of Professor Douglas Jemmett an experimental station license (9BT) was obtained in the spring of 1922. The station&#x27;s equipment was housed in the basement (later moved to the second floor) of the Electrical Engineering building, Fleming Hall (named after Sir Sandford Fleming). It had a power output of approximately 250 watts, and had an estimated range of 160 kilometres. While there were likely some preliminary, unscheduled broadcasts by 9BT, the station&#x27;s first scheduled public broadcast was on October 7, 1922, as Professor Richard O. Jolliffe called the football game between Queen&#x27;s and McGill. (At that time, the university&#x27;s football/rugby team, the Queen&#x27;s Tricolour, were the winners of the Grey Cup for three consecutive years, and it is a common myth that when the current call letters CFRC were assigned, their meaning was &quot;Canada&#x27;s Famous Rugby Champions&quot;; this acronym being possible, however, was purely coincidental). Some student broadcasters also said that CFRC meant &quot;Crazy Fellows Raising Cain&quot;.

An alumnus donation in early 1923 made possible the acquisition of better, more reliable transmitting equipment, and a private commercial licence was obtained under the call letters &quot;CFRC&quot; by July 1923. CFRC was Kingston&#x27;s only radio station and began airing programs from the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission in 1934, becoming a full affiliate in 1936 in a commercial partnership with the &quot;Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; newspaper. With the replacement of the CRBC with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936, CFRC became an affiliate.

In 1938, in what was possibly the station&#x27;s most notable broadcast, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s convocation speech at the university was relayed by CFRC to all North American radio networks.

CFRC remained a CBC station for several years however, with a weak signal and with commercial limitations placed on it by the university (such as a ban on advertising for patent medicine), the &quot;Whig-Standard&quot; sought its own station and, in 1942, launched CKWS 960 (now an FM station), at which time CKWS acquired CFRC&#x27;s CBC affiliation and its commercial license. In exchange for CKWS carrying some programming from the university, CFRC agreed not to compete commercially with CKWS for ten years and to only engage in broadcasts that filled the university&#x27;s educational mandate. The station reverted to an experimental outlet for the university&#x27;s Electrical Engineering Department until 1945 when it resumed programming on a limited basis as part of the Summer Radio Institute - a training program for broadcasters run with the CBC - and thereafter broadcasting non-commercial radio plays by the Queen&#x27;s Drama Guild. Since the station originally began broadcasting, CFRC periodically changed frequencies until it settled on 1490 AM on March 29, 1941. In 1954, CFRC-FM began broadcasting at 91.9 Megacycles on the FM dial to simulcast the programming of CFRC 1490. In 1957, the university appointed Margaret Angus as its first director of radio and students formed the CFRC Radio Club to produce programming and operate the station under her supervision as a fully fledged campus radio station. In 1986, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved Radio Queen&#x27;s application to change CFRC-FM&#x27;s frequency from 91.9 MHz to its current FM frequency, 101.9 MHz. In 1990 the AM frequency went dark and all CFRC programming moved to the FM frequency (which had been broadcasting separate programming since 1970) and a new stereo transmitter.

The station was for many years the only campus radio station in Canada to be owned and operated by a university rather than by its students. This changed in 2003 when ownership and management of the station was transferred from the university to the Alma Mater Society (Queen&#x27;s student government).

Due to changes in CRTC regulations, CFRC&#x27;s ownership transitioned from 2012 to 2014 so that it became an autonomous service, no longer owned and operated by the AMS. As a registered non-profit corporation, CFRC 101.9 FM is owned and operated by Radio Queen&#x27;s University.

CFRC also hosts a podcasting network providing training and resources for independent podcast production.

In the summer of 2024, Queens University station, CFRC-FM claims to be the last local radio station outlet in Kingston after Corus Entertainment cut local media on two Kingston FM radio stations CFMK-FM CKWS-FM. 

==CFRC Sports==

CFRC has for years provided regular coverage of all Queen&#x27;s Golden Gaels regular season and playoff football games. Intermittently, they have also provided coverage of Golden Gaels hockey and basketball.

<text>Dukla Prague () was a Czech football club from the city of Prague. Established in 1948 as ATK Praha, the club won a total of 11 Czechoslovak league titles and eight Czechoslovak Cups, and in the 1966–67 season, reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. As late as 1985–86 they reached the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final and they also made a great impact in the American Challenge Cup competition in New York City with four wins between 1961 and 1964. The club sent seven players to the silver medal-winning Czechoslovakia national team in the 1962 World Cup, in a year which saw them win the fifth of their domestic league titles as well as their player Josef Masopust be named European Footballer of the Year. Between the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the European Cup than any other team in Czechoslovakia.

Dukla Prague football club was connected to clubs of other sports, but this connection continues no longer. However, separate athletics, rowing, handball, modern pentathlon, cycling, etc. clubs named Dukla Praha still nurture world-class athletes in their respective sports (like Roman Šebrle and others). In contrast to the football clubs, these are still under patronage of the Czech Army.

== History ==
Dukla Prague was formed in 1948 as &quot; (ATK) Praha&quot; and started life in the top division of Czechoslovak football. The Dukla organisation, as it later became known, was run by the Czechoslovak Army and included seven sports teams. The club changed its name to &quot; (ÚDA) Praha&quot; in 1953, winning the first of eleven league titles in the 1953 season. The club went on to win the 1956 league title, changing their name to &quot;&quot; the same year in honour of those had fallen at the Battle of Dukla Pass in 1944. The subsequent 1957–58 season brought a second consecutive league title for the club, and its third overall.

The 1960–61 season marked the inaugural season of the Czechoslovak Cup. That season, the Dukla team completed a &quot;double&quot; as they defeated Dynamo Žilina in the cup final to add to their fourth league title. The club was on the verge of another double in 1962, winning the league but losing in the cup final to Slovan Bratislava. 1962 was also a World Cup year. Dukla was represented by seven players on the Czechoslovakia national football team, which reached the final before losing to Brazil. Dukla star Josef Masopust scored in the final as Brazil won 3–1, and was later named as the winner of the 1962 Ballon d&#x27;Or. Dukla spent the next two seasons winning the league again, making a total of four titles in a row. The 1964–65 season yielded just the Cup before Dukla completed its second double in 1965–66. The club&#x27;s final trophy of the decade came in the 1968–69 cup. In the first nine seasons of the cup competition, therefore, Dukla had reached six finals and won four titles.

The competition&#x27;s format changed after the 1968–69 season, and it was not until 1980–81 that Dukla would record another title in the competition, repeating the achievement in 1982–83, 1984–85 and 1989–90. In the 1985–86 season, the club recorded its record win, a 10–0 victory against Dynamo České Budějovice.

=== International competitions ===
Between the start of the competition in 1955 and 1991, Dukla played more matches in the European Cup (45) than any other team in Czechoslovakia. The five players from the Czechoslovak league with the most appearances in the competition in the pre-Champions League era of the European Cup all represented Dukla in the competition, these being Josef Masopust, Jozef Adamec, Jiří Čadek, Josef Vacenovský and Dušan Kabát.

Czech writer and sports journalist Ota Pavel wrote a unique book about Dukla&#x27;s first victory in the American Challenge Cup and named it &quot;Dukla mezi mrakodrapy&quot; ().

The supremacy of Dukla was so undisputed the organizers decided to establish the American Challenge Cup as the final of next International Soccer League editions, in which Dukla was invited to play against the winners of the group stage. Dukla won three American Challenge Cups, over Brazil&#x27;s America-RJ in 1962 (1–1 and 2–1), over West Ham United in 1963 (1–0 and 1–1) and over Zagłębie Sosnowiec in 1964 (3–1 and 1–1). In later years they struggled to maintain international recognition, however they were well known to British fans thanks to Half Man Half Biscuit&#x27;s cult song: &quot;All I want for Christmas is a Dukla Prague away kit&quot; which was the B-side of their 1986 single &quot;The Trumpton Riots&quot; and was subsequently issued on the album Back Again in the DHSS and then on the CD release of the album Back in the DHSS. Fans of the band have created considerable demand for replica Dukla Prague shirts and made the team a favourite among hipster football fans.

Dukla&#x27;s overall record in the International Soccer League and the American Challenge Cup thus comprises 11 wins, four draws and one loss with a score of 49–19.

=== Czech Republic era ===
1994 saw the club&#x27;s long-running association with the military come to an end and at the same time its status as a top-division team was lost. Dukla finished last in the 1993–94 Czech First League, employing three different managers over the course of the season. In a season which saw the club lose 7–0 to Viktoria Žižkov, Dukla won just one of their thirty matches, a 1–0 victory against Hradec Králové. Dukla played the following 1994–95 season in the third-tier Bohemian Football League, finishing in third place behind SK Chrudim and Pelikán Děčín. Dukla was unable to win the league in the 1995–96 season either, again finishing third, this time behind Atlantic Lázně Bohdaneč and Česká Lípa.

The club then merged with second division side FC Portál Příbram in 1996. The new club, which later became known as 1. FK Příbram, played one season in Prague at Juliska before moving to Příbram in 1997, the last home match at Juliska being a 2–2 draw with relegated Baník Havířov on 1 June 1997.

=== Reformation and return ===

The name of Dukla Prague disappeared from the Czech football for several years, but not forever. Dukla Dejvice, a local Prague team founded in 1959, began playing at Juliska stadium and adopted Dukla Prague&#x27;s yellow and red colours.

The club entered the Prague Championship in 2001. In November 2006, Dukla Prague management announced that it had agreed to take over the second league rights of the Jakubčovice team. The legendary club returned to the Czech top league in 2011.

<doc id="866333" wikidata="Q2339046" url="?curid=866333" title="Rafael Furcal">
<text>Rafael Antoni Furcal (born October 24, 1977) is a Dominican former professional baseball shortstop. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, and Miami Marlins. With St. Louis, he won the 2011 World Series over the Texas Rangers.

==Early life==
Furcal grew up in Loma de Cabrera, a small village in the Dominican Republic near the Dajabón River and the border with Haiti. His father, Silvino, drove a taxi, and his mother, Aura, was a schoolteacher. Furcal had three older brothers, José, Manuel, and Lorenzo, and a sister.

Silvino Furcal was a standout outfielder during an era when Dominican ballplayers did not get much recognition from Major League scouts. Silvino introduced his sons to baseball and Rafael credited his father with teaching him how to enjoy the game. Until his death in 2010, Silvino would often call Rafael to give him advice after games. Manuel Furcal pitched in the Seattle Mariners organization and Lorenzo played in the Oakland Athletics system before suffering career-ending injuries. José Furcal committed suicide in 1999 and Manuel died that same year in an accident.

Furcal attended Jose Cabrera High School and was prepared to enroll in engineering school before being spotted by a scout at a tryout in Santo Domingo. He was subsequently signed as an amateur free agent by the Atlanta Braves on November 9, 1996, for $5,000.

==Professional career==
===Minor League Baseball===
He began his professional career as a second baseman with the Gulf Coast Braves in 1997. The following season, with the Danville Braves he hit .328 and stole a league record 60 bases in only 66 games. He was named Danville&#x27;s Player of the Year and Appalachian League All-Star Second Baseman.

In 1999, he switched to shortstop and joined the Macon Braves in &quot;A&quot; ball and hit .337 with 73 stolen bases in 83 games. He was transferred to the advanced &quot;A&quot; team in Myrtle Beach and hit .293 for them with 23 steals in 43 games. He led all of minor league baseball with 96 steals total. He was named to Baseball America&#x27;s first team All-Star team and the South Atlantic League All-Star team. In addition, he was the Braves Minor League Player of the Year, the South Atlantic League Most Outstanding Prospect and a Class A All-Star.

===Atlanta Braves===
An injury to Braves shortstop Walt Weiss prior to the season led to Furcal improbably making the jump from &quot;A&quot; ball to the Major League roster. He made his Major League debut on April 4, 2000, against the Colorado Rockies, getting 2 hits in 4 at-bats. His first hit was against Rockies pitcher Rolando Arrojo.

Furcal went on to hit .295 with 40 stolen bases for the Braves and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award that year.

He missed most of the 2001 season because of a dislocated left shoulder, suffered while stealing second base in a July 6 game at Boston.

The Braves learned Furcal&#x27;s true age, then 23, at the start of the 2002 season. Before then, he had claimed he was only 21. He returned to the starting lineup that season and tied a modern Major League record with three triples in a game on April 21 against Florida.

Furcal completed an unassisted triple play for the Braves against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10, 2003. It was the 12th in baseball history. In the fifth inning, the shortstop caught pitcher Woody Williams&#x27; liner with the runners moving in a hit and run attempt, stepped on second base to retire catcher Mike Matheny (who later became Furcal&#x27;s manager in St. Louis) and tagged Orlando Palmeiro before he could return to first.

He was selected to the National League All-Star Team as a reserve in 2003.

In September 2004, during his final season with the Braves, he was arrested for drunk driving, violating his probation dating from an earlier drunk driving arrest in June 2000. Furcal was ordered to serve 21 days in jail. In an unusual arrangement, the beginning of the jail term was contingent upon the Braves&#x27; situation on the playoffs. His DUI attorney arranged that resolution so that the baseball team had its full contingency of players for the playoffs. Once the Braves were eliminated from post-season action, Furcal served his time.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

On December 7, 2005, Furcal signed a free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for three years and $39 million. In September Furcal was selected as the inaugural winner of the Roy Campanella Award, given to the Dodgers player who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Hall of Fame catcher. The award was voted on by only his teammates.

In May 2007, he became one of only six Major League players to get 4 hits in each of 3 consecutive games.
Early in 2008, he suffered a back injury that kept him sidelined for most of the season, not returning until right before the playoffs started.

In the fifth inning of Game Five the 2008 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Furcal made three errors to set records for most errors in one NLCS inning and game. He was just the second player to make three errors in one postseason inning. No shortstop had made three errors in one playoff game since Buck Weaver in the 1917 World Series. Two of the errors came on the same play as Furcal booted a routine groundball hit by Pat Burrell and then airmailed his throw behind home plate in a failed attempt to prevent Chase Utley from scoring.

On December 19, 2008, after speculation that he would re-sign with the Braves as a free agent, Furcal signed a 3-year $30 million contract to stay with the Dodgers.

Furcal struggled in the first year of his new contract, hitting only .269 for the Dodgers in 2009. His on-base plus slugging of .711 was also below his career average of .757.

Furcal was added to the 2010 National League All-Star team as a reserve after New York Mets shortstop José Reyes suffered an injury and was forced to withdraw. Furcal walked in his only plate appearance in the game. Due to injuries he only appeared in 97 games for the Dodgers in 2010, but finished with a .300 batting average and stole 22 bases.

In 2011, he spent more time on the disabled list than the active roster for the Dodgers, appearing in just 37 games, during which he hit only .197.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

Furcal was traded along with cash considerations to the St. Louis Cardinals on July 30, 2011 for Double-A outfielder Alex Castellanos. In 50 games with the Cardinals, he hit .255 with 7 home runs. In the 2011 World Series, he only hit .179 but picked up his only World Series ring when the Cards won the series by beating the Texas Rangers in seven games.

On October 31, 2011, the St. Louis Cardinals declined his $12 million option for 2012. The club signed Furcal to a 2-year, $14 million deal on December 10, 2011. During the 2012 season Furcal was batting .264 with five home runs and 49 RBIs until being sidelined with an elbow injury on August 30. An MRI of the elbow revealed damage to a ligament in his throwing arm. Furcal would be placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the season in order to undergo four to six weeks of physical rehabilitation in the hopes of forestalling surgical repair. As a replacement for Furcal, the Cardinals called up Pete Kozma from the Triple-A affiliate Memphis Redbirds.

On March 7, 2013 the Cardinals announced that Furcal would undergo Tommy John surgery and would almost certainly miss all of the 2013 baseball season. An off-season program of rest and rehabilitation for his damaged right elbow at first appeared to be successful, as Furcal reported for Cardinals spring training. However a bone spur began to cause discomfort prompting an MRI and examination by Cardinals team radiologist Greg Cizek on March 4, 2013, who recommended surgery. A second opinion from noted surgeon Dr. James Andrews confirmed the diagnosis on March 6, 2013. He became a free agent after the 2013 World Series on October 31, 2013.

===Miami Marlins===
On December 6, 2013, Furcal signed a one-year deal with the Miami Marlins. With the younger Adeiny Hechavarria at shortstop, Furcal was projected to play second base with the Marlins. He made his Marlins debut on June 13, 2014, against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

===Kansas City Royals===
On March 17, 2015, Furcal signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released on March 31 and then re-signed the following day to another minor league contract. He played just seven games in the minors for the Wilmington Blue Rocks and Northwest Arkansas Naturals, hitting .240. On May 19, he announced his retirement.

==Personal life==
During the offseason, Furcal played for the Aguilas Cibaeñas. He resides in Santiago, Dominican Republic with his family. Furcal met his wife, Glenny, during his final spring training with the Braves and the couple has two sons together, Rafael Jr. (born in 2006) and Anthony (born in 2008). Furcal also has a daughter named Ashley (born in 2004) from a previous relationship.

Furcal has used his baseball earnings to give back to his hometown. When Furcal re-signed with the Dodgers in 2008, he arranged to have the Los Angeles Fire Department donate a fire truck to Loma de Cabrera which, until then, did not have a fire department. He has also arranged to pay the hospital bills of Loma de Cabrera residents.

Furcal&#x27;s father, Silvino, died on Father&#x27;s Day in 2010 after being kicked by a horse on the family&#x27;s farm.

Furcal was considered for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time in 2020.

<text>Lagan Valley is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons.

The constituency always returned unionist MPs from its creation until the 2024 general election, when it returned Sorcha Eastwood of the Alliance Party.

== History ==
For the history of the equivalent constituencies prior to 1950, see Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) and Down (UK Parliament constituency) and from 1950 until 1983, please see South Antrim (UK Parliament constituency) and North Down.

== Boundaries ==

1983–1997: The District of Lisburn, and the Borough of Castlereagh ward of Carryduff.

1997–2010: The District of Lisburn wards of Ballinderry, Ballymacash, Ballymacbrennan, Ballymacoss, Blaris, Derryaghy, Dromara, Drumbo, Dunmurry, Glenavy, Harmony Hill, Hilden, Hillhall, Hillsborough, Knockmore, Lagan Valley, Lambeg, Lisnagarvey, Maghaberry, Magheralave, Maze, Moira, Old Warren, Seymour Hill, Tonagh, and Wallace Park, and the District of Banbridge wards of Dromore North, Dromore South, Gransha, and Quilly.

2010–2024: The City of Lisburn wards of Ballinderry, Ballymacash, Ballymacbrennan, Ballymacoss, Blaris, Dromara, Drumbo, Harmony Hill, Hilden, Hillhall, Hillsborough, Knockmore, Lagan Valley, Lambeg, Lisnagarvey, Maghaberry, Magheralave, Maze, Moira, Old Warren, Seymour Hill, Tonagh, Wallace Park, and part of Derryaghy; the District of Banbridge wards of Dromore North, Dromore South, Gransha, and Quilly and the Ballynahatty and Edenderry parts of the Belvoir ward of the City of Belfast.

2024–present: The District of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon wards of Aghagallon, Donaghcloney, Dromore, Gransha, Magheralin, and Quilly; and the District of Lisburn and Castlereagh wards of Ballinderry, Ballymacash, Ballymacbrennan, Ballymacoss, Blaris, Dromara, Harmony Hill, Hilden, Hillhall, Hillsborough, Knockmore, Lagan, Lagan Valley, Lambeg, Lisnagarvey, Maghaberry, Magheralave, Maze, Moira, Old Warren, Ravernet, Wallace Park, and White Mountain.

The seat was created in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from parts of South Antrim and North Down. In their original proposals, in January 1980, the boundary commission proposed calling it &#x27;Lagan&#x27;. In further revisions in 1995 it lost some areas to both Belfast West and Strangford.

Following their review of all parliamentary seats in Northern Ireland prior to the 2010 United Kingdom general election the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland made alterations to Lagan Valley. In an unprecedented decision, passed by Parliament through the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order, one electoral ward was split between two constituencies. This followed concerns in Derriaghy about being moved into the neighbouring but republican West Belfast seat.

== Members of Parliament ==
The Member of Parliament since 1997 was Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who was elected as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party but switched to the Democratic Unionist Party in 2004. He succeeded James Molyneaux who had represented the seat for the UUP since the 1983 general election and previously sat for the old South Antrim constituency which covered much of the same area. Donaldson was elected Leader of the DUP in June 2021, but resigned the leadership in March 2024.
==Elections==
=== Elections in the 2020s ===





=== Elections in the 2010s ===




This seat saw a swing towards the Alliance Party of over 17%, and the largest decrease in vote share for the DUP at the 2019 general election.

<doc id="866341" wikidata="Q4859518" url="?curid=866341" title="Blind River, Ontario">
<text>Blind River is a town situated on the North Channel of Lake Huron in the Algoma District, Ontario, Canada. The town, named after the nearby Blind River, celebrated its centennial in 2006.

==History==
French explorers discovered the North Channel and made it a renowned voyageur route. Fur traders, loggers and miners followed to seek natural resources. A fur trading post was established by the North West Company in 1789 at the mouth of the Mississagi River. When the fur trade slowed about 1820, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company purchased the North West Company. A number of trappers settled along the rivers flowing into Lake Huron. One of the rivers, just three miles (5 km) east of the Mississagi mouth, was called Penewobecong, which translates to &quot;smooth rock or sloping&quot;. The voyageurs named the river the Blind River because the mouth was not easily visible along the canoe route. The name Blind River was adopted by the settlement that grew at the mouth of the river. Blind River&#x27;s post office was established in 1877.
The logging industry developed because of the accessibility of timber along the Blind River and Mississagi watersheds. The industry was spurred by a copper discovery in the mid-19th century in Bruce Mines. The first sawmill was built beside the mouth of the Blind River at the current site of the Old Mill Motel. The protected estuary of the east arm of the Blind River as well as the deep water offshore offered a good location for the mill. The sawmill provided timber and planks for the copper mine. The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Blind River in 1888 when its Algoma Branch was extended westward from Algoma Mills to Sault Ste. Marie.

By 1906, when Blind River had been incorporated as a town, a second larger sawmill had been erected on the west arm of the Blind River. Today the west arm is the location of the Blind River Marine Park. In 1929, the Carpenter Hixon Company built a state-of-the-art pine sawmill producing 89 million board feet of lumber in its first year. Through boom and bust the mill survived under the name McFadden Lumber Company for over forty years as the largest white pine sawmill east of the Rocky Mountains, with an annual capacity of 120,000,000 board feet (280,000 m³) of lumber, an output never reached in actual production.. The Great Mississagi Fire of 1948 led to a depletion of timber, difficult economic conditions and the eventual closing of the mill in 1969. The lumber history is commemorated in the Timber Village Museum.

In 1955, uranium was discovered near Blind River. The first uranium mine began operation as the Pronto Mine in Algoma Mills. Although its life was short-lived, its significance was that it led to the discovery of the entire Blind River-Elliot Lake uranium mining camp. In 1983 a uranium refinery was built just west of Blind River. This uranium refinery is owned and operated by the Cameco Corporation, which processes uranium concentrates from all over the world into uranium trioxide.

The town of Blind River made headlines in 1991 for a double homicide that occurred at the local rest stop off the Trans-Canada Highway. On June 28, 1991, an unknown assailant shot an elderly couple from Lindsay, Ontario, Gord McAllister, 62, and his wife Jackie, 59, and 29-year-old Brian Major. The killer gained entry into the McAllisters&#x27; motor home by posing as a police officer. Jackie McAllister and Brian Major died of their wounds. The case was profiled in 1993 on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;. No one has ever been charged in the homicides, but a suspect, Ronald Glenn West (a former Toronto police officer convicted of two rape-murders in Toronto in 1970 for which he is currently serving two life sentences, and of a series of robbery-assaults in Sault Ste. Marie in 1995), was under suspicion. Gord McAllister died on February 14, 2012.

Until 1997, Blind River had its own radio station, CJNR-AM 730. In 1997, the station was absorbed into the new CKNR-FM, based in Elliot Lake.

==Economy==

Its main businesses are tourism, fishing, logging, and uranium refining.

Transportation links are Highway 17 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway), the Huron Central Railway operating on the leased Canadian Pacific Railway line that runs through the town, and the Blind River Marine Park, a town-owned marina servicing pleasure craft. A 1991 study by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation proposed the extension of Highway 555 (Granary Lake Road) from Blind River to meet Spine Road in Elliot Lake, creating a new route which would reduce the length of a commute between the two communities by approximately 20 kilometres. Although the ministry has announced no firm plans to construct the proposed road, Elliot Lake City Council passed a motion in August 2015 calling for the project&#x27;s revival on the grounds that it would provide significant economic benefit to both communities.

The town also provides services to the surrounding communities through its District Health Centre, two high schools (W.C. Eaket Secondary School and École secondaire catholique Jeunesse-Nord) and three elementary schools (Blind River Public School, St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School and the French-language École Catholique St-Joseph). Blind River has seven churches, as well as a Kingdom Hall located just outside the town, and a variety of merchants and service industries.

Blind River has many beaches on Lake Huron, including Fourth Sand, Sellers Park, Boom Camp, Forest Glen Beach, as well as many others. Blind River is home to a large uranium refinery operated by the Cameco Corporation, which is situated just outside town as well as a world-renowned golf course by the name of Huron Pines Country Club, which is just 1.5 kilometres away from one of the longest running businesses in the area, MacIver&#x27;s Motel &amp; Camp Ltd, which has been family operated since 1946.

It is also home of Lauzon Aviation Co. Ltd since 1959. Lauzon Aviation is a family owned and operated outfitter offering Fly-In Hunting &amp; Fishing Wilderness Vacations. They have appeared in several TV episodes of Fishing Canada and The New Fly Fisherman and featured in articles in Ontario Out of Doors, Field &amp; Stream, Outdoor Life and published Trade History of the North Shore and Lake Huron.

&lt;poem&gt;Well, it was back in Blind River in 1962
When I last saw you alive
But we missed that shift on the long decline
Long may you run.&lt;/poem&gt;

* Wade Hemsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Black Fly Song&quot;, about a survey crew in northern Ontario in 1949, has a verse about a cook named &quot;Blind River Joe&quot;.

<text>Duran Duran (commonly known as the Wedding Album) is the seventh studio album and the second self-titled album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 15 February 1993 through Parlophone and Capitol Records.

==Background==
By the early 1990s, Duran Duran&#x27;s career appeared to be in decline. Their 1990 album &quot;Liberty&quot;, despite debuting at number eight in the UK Albums Chart, quickly fell out of favour, struggling commercially and critically in both the UK and the US. Singles such as &quot;Violence of Summer (Love&#x27;s Taking Over)&quot; and &quot;Serious&quot; failed to make significant chart impacts, while much of the album&#x27;s material was met with indifference or outright criticism from the press. Reflecting on this period, band members Nick Rhodes and Simon Le Bon admitted to a lack of focus during the creation of &quot;Liberty&quot;, with Le Bon noting, &quot;There were times when everyone in the band felt like giving up.&quot;

After the commercial disappointment of &quot;Liberty&quot;, Duran Duran entered a period of uncertainty. Drummer Sterling Campbell departed the band quietly, later joining Soul Asylum. The remaining members faced personal and professional challenges: John Taylor struggled with his mental health, Rhodes was navigating a difficult marital breakup while caring for a young child, and Le Bon expressed a desire to escape to a quieter life by the sea. In contrast, guitarist Warren Cuccurullo emerged as the driving force behind the band during this period. Reflecting on his determination, Cuccurullo stated, &quot;I was the hungriest. I wanted success. I wanted to go beyond where I had gone. All I had was my music.&quot; He converted the living room of his house in Battersea, London, into a makeshift studio, which became the primary workspace for the band&#x27;s next project. Rhodes supported the idea, commenting that the space had a more inviting atmosphere compared to traditional studios. 

==Recording==
In January 1991, Duran Duran began work on their second self-titled album at Warren Cuccurullo&#x27;s home studio in Battersea. With a modest setup that included a sequencer, drum machine, synthesisers, and Cuccurullo&#x27;s guitar rig, the band aimed for a relaxed, cost-effective environment compared to traditional studio sessions. Reflecting on this change, John Taylor noted, &quot;We&#x27;d never recorded in a home studio before. The difference this time was we didn’t have to keep looking at the clock. It gave us freedom to explore creatively.&quot;

The band arranged their equipment in Cuccurullo&#x27;s living room, with Le Bon performing at the center while Rhodes&#x27;s keyboards and Cuccurullo&#x27;s sequencers surrounded the space. Producer John Jones, who joined the project midway, described his workstation as including an Atari running Notator and an Akai S1000 sampler. He recalled, &quot;They asked if we could make a record in a living room, and I said we certainly could.&quot;

Working six to eight hours daily, the band alternated between live jams, demo recordings, and writing sessions. Their goal was to demo 15 songs while receiving feedback from their record label, Capitol-EMI. To ensure progress, Capitol-EMI adopted a more hands-on approach, monitoring the band&#x27;s work closely. According to Taylor, this was the first time the label implemented a tightly controlled A&amp;R process, granting funding incrementally based on the quality of the material submitted. 

The recording sessions were fluid and iterative, with the band frequently making changes to multiple elements of a song at once. For example, adjustments to the bass were often accompanied by changes to drums or keyboards. By the end of these initial sessions, the band had composed a significant collection of material, including &quot;Love Voodoo&quot;, &quot;Sin of the City&quot;, &quot;Too Much Information&quot;, &quot;U.M.F.&quot;, &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, and &quot;Breath After Breath&quot;, with the latter featuring a collaboration with Milton Nascimento. Le Bon noted that the band had finally found the productive rhythm they had been seeking since the mid-1980s.

Despite the creative freedom afforded by the home studio, technical limitations led the band to relocate to Maison Rouge Studios in South-West London by mid-1991. Here, they refined tracks using live drums, keyboards, and additional layers. Drummer Steve Ferrone completed his parts for &quot;Ordinary World&quot; in just a few hours, with engineer Tony Taverner overseeing the sessions. Jones and Rhodes further polished the track&#x27;s arrangement, preparing it for final mixing.

Later in the process, the band added two more tracks to the album: a cover of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot;, featuring backing vocals from Tessa Niles. &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; was done at the suggestion of Cuccurullo&#x27;s friend Frank Zappa. By the time &quot;Come Undone&quot; was recorded in 1992, most of the album had been completed. Taylor had already departed for Los Angeles to visit his wife, along with Le Bon and Rhodes. In Taylor&#x27;s absence, Jones stepped in to play bass for the track.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Duran Duran&quot; showcases an eclectic mix of musical styles and influences, mainly pop rock and dance-pop. Jones compared the album&#x27;s creative process to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;, noting its emphasis on artistic freedom and individuality. Speaking to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Jones described the approach as one focused on making music they genuinely enjoyed, free from rigid formulas or constraints.

The opening track, &quot;Too Much Information&quot;, features a rock-oriented sound with lyrics critiquing media saturation and the pressures of fame. David Chiu of &quot;Forbes&quot; described it as a &quot;hard-rocking&quot; commentary on mass media, inspired by the band&#x27;s reflections on the Gulf War and their frustrations with the entertainment industry. Annie Zaleski of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; noted its &quot;keyboard-propelled&quot; style and highlighted lyrics such as &quot;Destroyed by MTV / I hate to bite the hand that feeds me so much information&quot; as emblematic of the band&#x27;s critique of overexposure. The ballad &quot;Ordinary World&quot; was written in response to the death of a close friend of Simon Le Bon. Le Bon explained in Behind the Music that the song was a way to let go of sadness and move forward: &quot;But I won&#x27;t cry for yesterday / There&#x27;s an ordinary world...,&quot; he wrote, reflecting his desire to find peace and resilience. 

&quot;Love Voodoo&quot; shifts to a sleek, electro-inspired sound, with Zaleski describing it as &quot;languid&quot; and &quot;seductive&quot;. This is followed by &quot;Drowning Man&quot;, which, according to Zaleski, draws on textures and rhythms reminiscent of the underground rave scene of the early 1990s. The brief instrumental &quot;Shotgun&quot;, described by Andrea Odintz in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;Prince-inspired&quot;, leads into &quot;Come Undone&quot;, a trip-hop-inflected ballad. Written by Le Bon for his wife Yasmin Le Bon, the song features circular guitar riffs, &quot;watery keyboards&quot;, and emotional vocals. Zaleski called it a &quot;vulnerable&quot; track, noting the contribution of backing vocalist Tessa Niles. &quot;Breath After Breath&quot;, a samba-influenced ballad featuring Brazilian artist Milton Nascimento, incorporates Portuguese lyrics sung by Nascimento.

The slinky &quot;U.M.F.&quot; has been described by Zaleski as &quot;Prince-like&quot;, blending funk and R&amp;B grooves with Le Bon&#x27;s nuanced vocal delivery. Similarly, Mark Elliott of &quot;Dig!&quot; called Duran Duran&#x27;s take on the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; as melodic. &quot;None of the Above&quot; features a bass-driven arrangement and introspective lyrics, which Elliott characterised as an &quot;ode to self-discovery&quot;. Zaleski noted its &quot;nimble guitar work&quot; and described it as an &quot;upbeat contemporary pop song&quot;. &quot;Shelter&quot; incorporates urgent synthesisers and funk elements, with Paul Sinclair of &quot;Super Deluxe Edition&quot; describing it as a &quot;heavy-footed funk workout.&quot; He also noted similar qualities in &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot;, a protest song with chant-like lyrics written by Nick Rhodes. The album closes with &quot;Sin of the City&quot;, a seven-minute track inspired by a real-life tragedy. Co-producer John Jones reflected on the song&#x27;s creation in an interview with &quot;Forbes&quot;, recalling the informal recording process in which the band incorporated spontaneous clapping and ambient sounds. Sinclair described the track as having a &quot;compulsive vocal hook&quot;, while Elliott referred to it as &quot;a lengthy end to an otherwise tight work&quot;.

== Title and packaging ==
The band ultimately chose to self-title the album after describing themselves as having to go &quot;back to the basics&quot;, though the record was referred to as &quot;the Wedding Album&quot; immediately upon release.

The album cover for &quot;Duran Duran&quot; was created by graphic designer Nick Egan, in collaboration with his assistant Eric Roinestad. Roinestad handled the layout while Egan worked closely with the band to ensure that the visual concept aligned with their artistic vision. The design featured a solitary gold Duran Duran logo over a selection of sepia-toned wedding photos of each band member&#x27;s parents. As described by Andrew Dineley of &quot;Classic Pop&quot;, the album&#x27;s aesthetic &quot;could be read as a DIY-style, punk-era fanzine pastiche&quot;. Dineley further noted that &quot;like the music it packaged, the design seemed to reference a diversity of influences&quot;, such as the raw illustrative style of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the pop-art print effects reminiscent of Andy Warhol, the latter also visible on the single cover for &quot;Too Much Information&quot;.

Following a series of coincidences and collaborative efforts between Egan and the band, the initial concept for the album&#x27;s artwork began when Duran Duran&#x27;s bassist, John Taylor, mentioned to the American actor Billy Zane that he was seeking Egan to design the album cover. Zane, who was a friend of both Taylor and Egan, informed Taylor that Egan was in London at the time, which led to an immediate meeting between Egan and Taylor at Taylor&#x27;s house in London. Egan later reflected on the serendipitous nature of the encounter, saying, &quot;You could say that it was written in the stars from my point of view. It all just fell into place.&quot;

The band&#x27;s concept for the album cover was distinct and unconventional. Instead of opting for a typical, expensive photoshoot, they decided to use photographs from their parents&#x27; weddings. Egan found this idea to be highly innovative. He recalled, &quot;It was this concept that convinced me that this was going to be something special visually, but it also made me realize that Duran were one of the most innovative and creative bands of theirs – and subsequent – generations. They were never predictable.&quot;

Egan&#x27;s main concern was to avoid the kitsch aesthetic often associated with wedding photography, which he described as &quot;white, lacey with silver horse-shoe confetti decorations&quot;. To achieve a more artistic and sophisticated look, Egan drew inspiration from the Pop Art collage techniques of Robert Rauschenberg. He said, &quot;I wanted it to be like a piece of art... that&#x27;s where I took the influence of Pop Art Collageist Robert Rauschenberg, who laid seemingly random images on top of each other with the faintest hint of off-register color as if the whole thing was screen printed.&quot;

==Release and singles==
The unexpected leak of their song &quot;Ordinary World&quot; to radio stations in Jacksonville, Florida caught the band off guard. Speculation arose that their own record label had intentionally leaked the track to gauge public interest, as Duran Duran had seen a decline in popularity after a decade of chart success. To their surprise, &quot;Ordinary World&quot; received positive reception from listeners and was a hit at radio stations, sparking a renewed interest in the band&#x27;s music. The positive feedback led to Capitol Records advancing the song&#x27;s release as a single. &quot;Ordinary World&quot; was officially released as a single on 19 December 1992 by Capitol Records and made its debut on record charts the following year, reaching number six in the UK and number three in the US.

&quot;Duran Duran&quot; was released two months later on 15 February 1993. Its already successful lead single propelled it high onto the UK Albums Chart, debuting at number four. The album would not appear on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until the week of 13 March, where it debuted at number seven. This notably gave the band another top-ten hit in the US since their 1984 live album &quot;Arena&quot;. Unlike their previous album that suffered poor album sales and had fallen off the charts within weeks of release, &quot;Duran Duran&quot; was able to maintain a stable amount of sales for months in both their homeland and the US, fluctuating between the top 20 and 30 weeks after release.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Duran Duran&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release, with opinions reflecting on the band&#x27;s attempt at a comeback. Sam Wood of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; described the album as a potential &quot;second coming of the Duranies&quot;, praising the shift toward &quot;pop respectability&quot; with tracks like the ballad &quot;Ordinary World&quot;. He commended the thematic maturity of the lyrics, the inclusion of Brazilian artist Milton Nascimento on &quot;Breath After Breath,&quot; and the album&#x27;s strong dance-pop influences, likening its quality to 1986&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot;. Alan Jones of &quot;Music Week&quot; offered a positive assessment, giving the album four out of five stars. He noted that the band had put considerable thought and care into the album&#x27;s production, highlighting its diversity. He concluded that the album demonstrated unexpected strength and affirmed that Duran Duran remained &quot;a force to be reckoned with.&quot;

In contrast, Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a &quot;D&quot; rating, criticising its production as &quot;overproduced&quot; and the songwriting as lacking the memorable melodies of the band&#x27;s earlier work. He described &quot;Ordinary World&quot; as a weaker derivative of its influences and singled out the cover of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; and the collaboration with Nascimento as ineffective. Dave Obee of the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; observed that the band struggled to distance themselves from their 1980s success while attempting to reconnect with audiences. He noted their influential role in the music industry but remarked on the challenge of maintaining relevance. Similarly, Clark Collis of &quot;Select&quot; acknowledged the success of singles like &quot;Ordinary World&quot; but criticised the album for inconsistent quality and a lack of innovation, suggesting that it rarely matched the high points of its standout tracks.

=== Retrospective assessments ===
Retrospective reviews of &quot;Duran Duran&quot; have been mixed, with critics reflecting on the album’s strengths and its place in the band&#x27;s career. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album for blending Duran Duran&#x27;s classic style with a more mature approach, describing it as a successful adaptation to the 1990s music landscape. He highlighted &quot;Ordinary World&quot; and &quot;Come Undone&quot; as standout tracks, calling them &quot;wonderful pop singles&quot;, but noted weaker moments, such as the cover of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;.

Andrea Odintz of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; offered a more reserved perspective. She acknowledged the band&#x27;s effort to evolve by incorporating elements of Prince and techno but felt the album was more compelling when the band leaned on their own distinctive style. While she praised &quot;Ordinary World&quot; for its spiritual qualities, Odintz criticized some tracks for following contemporary trends too closely and suggested that the album was uneven in quality compared to their earlier successes.

<doc id="866343" wikidata="Q7376488" url="?curid=866343" title="Rubén Gómez (baseball)">
<text>Rubén Gómez (July 13, 1927 – July 26, 2004) was a professional right-handed starting pitcher who became the first Puerto Rican to pitch in a World Series game. He was also the winning pitcher in the first Major League Baseball game played west of Kansas City. In his homeland, Gómez was nicknamed El Divino Loco (&quot;the Divine Madman&quot;), on account of his willingness to pitch in tough situations and #22.

==Major league career==
Gómez (birth name: Rubén Gómez Colón) was born in Arroyo, Puerto Rico. He debuted with the New York Giants on April 17, 1953. He finished his rookie season with a 13–11 record. Gómez created some controversy when, on the order of Giants&#x27; manager Leo Durocher, he hit Brooklyn Dodgers player Carl Furillo with a pitch. Gómez would hit other notables with pitches in his career, including Joe Adcock and Frank Robinson.

After going 17–9 in his second season, Gómez pitched and won Game 3 of the 1954 World Series in the Giants sweep of the Cleveland Indians. He thus became the first Puerto Rican player to be a member of a World Series championship team, becoming a hero in his native country (schools closed the day he pitched in the World Series so students could watch the game). When Gómez returned to Puerto Rico, he was greeted by thousands of fans at the San Juan airport and a holiday was declared.

After the 1957 season, the Dodgers and Giants moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. On April 15, 1958, Gómez made baseball history when he pitched an 8–0 shutout against the Dodgers at San Francisco&#x27;s Seals Stadium in the first Major League Baseball game played on the West Coast. He thus became the first pitcher to win a game played on the West Coast; the losing pitcher was future Hall of Famer Don Drysdale.

In 1958, Gómez was traded to the Phillies. In the 1959 season he was only 3–8 in 72 innings, and went 0–3 in 1960. He was out of the major leagues in 1961 and returned in 1962 to pitch for both the Indians and the Twins, compiling a combined 2–3 record. Five years later he returned to finish his major league career with innings for the Phillies.

==Other professional leagues==
Gómez later went to the Mexican League, where he pitched with Veracruz, Mexico. One day a young boy begged Gómez to buy a lottery ticket that he was selling to make some badly needed money. The boy insisted that Gómez buy the ticket because his uniform number matched that of the ticket, and Gómez, who did not normally buy such tickets, agreed. To his great surprise the ticket was a winner of a $35,000 prize. Gómez attempted to share the money with the boy&#x27;s family and when they refused, he went to a local bank and set up a trust fund for the lad, to be given to him at age 18. In 1967, Gómez was 39 years old and still playing with Veracruz, when the Phillies gave him another shot. He pitched only innings that season in seven games, making his last appearance on May 2, 1967.

Between 1947 and 1977, Gómez played 28 winter seasons with the Cangrejeros de Santurce and Vaqueros de Bayamón of the Puerto Rican league, setting league marks for a pitcher in wins (174) and ERA (2.97). In addition, his six victories in the Caribbean World Series ties him with José Bracho and Camilo Pascual for the most all-time wins in the tournament.

Gómez also pitched in the Venezuelan league for the Navegantes del Magallanes during the 1965–1966 season, and from 1968 to 1970 in the Saguenay senior league for the Chicoutimi Bombardiers. He was the star of the league. His first year with Chicoutimi he got a perfect record of 12–0 and an earned run average of 1.20. Next year, 1969, he went 9–1 with a 0.82 ERA. Two other former MLB players also played in that league: Art Ditmar and Wayne Granger.

Baseball historians Bill James and Rob Neyer have ranked Gómez&#x27;s screwball the tenth-best of all time.

==Later years==
In 2001, Gómez was hospitalized after a lengthy fight against cancer, and was about to receive surgery. A doctor from Mexico requested permission to attend the operation. When Gómez asked the doctor why he had come, he replied, &quot;I was that little boy, the money that you left in trust was enough to pay for my medical school.&quot;

Rubén Gómez Colón died in Carolina, Puerto Rico, at the age of 77. Among those who attended his funeral services was his best friend and countryman, former big leaguer Luis Rodríguez Olmo. Gómez was buried in the Guayama Municipal Cemetery in Guayama, Puerto Rico.

<text>Irene &quot;Rena&quot; Vlahopoulou (Greek: Ειρήνη (Ρένα) Βλαχοπούλου; 28 July 1923 – 29 July 2004) was a Greek actress and singer. She starred in theatre, musical and Greek cinema productions, including &quot;The Gambler&quot; and &quot;The Countess of Corfu&quot;.

==Biography==
Vlahopoulou was born on 28 July 1923 on the island of Corfu, the fifth of nine children. She first began playing the piano, taught by her father, Giannis Vlahopoulos. When she turned ten, she began singing at a local bakery; she was a talented dancer and actress and a qualified mezzo-soprano. Over the course of her fifty-five-year career she appeared in 105 theatrical plays between 1939 and 1994, and twenty-six films between 1951 and 1985.

In 1939, Vlahopoulou and AEK Athens footballer, Kostas Vasiliou eloped to Athens and were married. She began singing at the &quot;Oasis&quot; varieté show in the Zappeion gardens, where Mimis Traiforos presented his new work. In the winter of 1930–40, she sang at the World Theatre of Kostas Makedos on Panepistimiou Street.

The marriage with Vasiliou ended. In 1942 she married her second husband, a banker, Giannis Kostopoulos; the couple divorced in 1946. She married her third and final husband, entrepreneur Giorgos Lafazanis, on 18 September 1967. They remained wed until her death in 2004. Vlahopoulou had no children by any of her marriages. She left Finos Film in 1966 and moved to Karagiannis-Karatzopoulos. From 1972, she continued to star in films for the next seven years. In 1992–93, she starred in the musical comedy &quot;Gia Tin Ellada Re Gamo To&quot; (&quot;Για την Ελλάδα ρε γαμώ το&quot;), after which she retired.

Vlahopoulou died at 7 pm on 29 July 2004, after being hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Athens Medical Center, aged 81. On 30 July 2004, her body was exposed in a popular pilgrimage in the chapel of Saint Lazarus in the First Cemetery of Athens. She was buried at a public expense on 31 July 2004, accompanied by the band of the Philharmonic Society &quot;Mantzaros&quot; that came from Corfu, in the presence of many of her colleagues and ordinary people. On the day of her funeral all shops in Corfu remained closed, as a sign of mourning. Her hometown honored her by naming the old theatre &quot;Mon Repo&quot;, to the &quot;Rena Vlahopoulou&quot; theatre.

<text>Computervision, Inc. (CV) was an early pioneer in Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Computervision was founded in 1969 by Marty Allen and Philippe Villers, and headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, United States. Its early products were built on a Data General Nova platform. Starting around 1975, Computervision built its own &quot;CGP&quot; (Computervision Graphics Processor) Nova-compatible 16-bit computers with added instructions optimized for graphics applications and using its own operating system known as Computervision Graphic Operating System (CGOS). In the 1980s, Computervision rewrote their code to operate on Unix-based platforms.

Computervision was acquired by Prime Computer in 1988 for $434 million. Prime subsequently adopted the Computervision name. On December 12, 1998 Parametric Technology Corporation acquired Computervision.

==CADDS product history==

Computervision&#x27;s first product, CADDS-1, was aimed at the printed circuit board layout and 2-D drafting markets. CADDS stood for Computervison Automated Design and Drafting System. The CADDS-1 system featured a combination digitizer and plotter mounted on a large drafting table.

Integrated circuit layout was added with the CADDS-2 product, which had a dedicated operating system and a 16-bit graphic database. When this proved insufficient resolution for VLSI (very large scale integration), the company developed CADDS-2/VLSI in the late 1970s. CADDS-2/VLSI included a new operating system, a 32-bit database, and user expandability through a dedicated programming language called ICPL (integrated circuit programming language), which was a dialect of BASIC, based on an interpreter licensed from Fairchild Semiconductor. The original CADDS-2 ran on Data General Nova 1200 computers. CADDS-2/VLSI ran on Computervision&#x27;s own hardware/software which was a modified Data General Nova with a modified version of DG&#x27;s RDOS operating system.

CADDS3 was introduced in the late 1970s on the CGP80 and CGP100 using Tektronix storage tube vector devices as display terminals and graphics tablets with menus for operator input. CADDS3 was written in Fortran and based on software developed by Patrick Hanratty and acquired from S3 Corporation around 1973. In 1975, Computervision introduced an improved database that allowed additional entities and data types to be introduced easily. Other improvements, including a B-spline package and improved refresh performance led to adoption by many large customers, including Boeing, which purchased dozens of systems for the 757/767 aircraft program.

Improved 3-D design was added in the early 1980s with the CADDS4 product on the CGP200. This version of CADDS moved display technology from storage tube base displays to raster graphics and introduced the dedicated graphics co-processor board known as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

With CADDS4, tailored packages were available for CAD drafting, CAM (computer-aided manufacturing), 3-D modeling, piping and plant design, printed circuit board layout, instrument panel design, and many other applications. During this period, they also contributed to the development of the IGES standard for CAD/CAM data exchange, along with Applicon and other competitors.

The major breakthrough in 3-D Design was with the CADDS4X on the CGP200X running CGOS200X. This version of the operating system and hardware improved memory management (not true virtual memory) and increased program size. In 1984 a cluster of CGP200X with a proprietary 32-bit processor Analytic Processing Unit (APU) was offered as the Computervision Distributed System (CDS) 4000. The APU was sometimes called &quot;All Paws Up&quot;.

CADDS production continued into the twenty-first century. As of 2019, CADDS (now at version CADDS5) was offered as a CAD/CAM system specialized for shipbuilding.

==MEDUSA product history==
In 1983 Computervision purchased Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS), founded by British computer scientist Dr. Dick Newell and Tom Sancha. Computervision was interested in obtaining some of the state-of-the-art technology of the MEDUSA CAD system the Cambridge company had developed. CIS had a partnership with Prime Computer which maintained its option on the MEDUSA source code. At the time, MEDUSA was available on the then newly released 32-bit so-called super mini computers, whose most prominent distributors were Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (with their VAX hardware) and Prime Computer. In 1984 there was a fork in MEDUSA as Prime took its option to keep developing MEDUSA. This in effect created two different versions of MEDUSA: CIS MEDUSA (owned by Computervision, which ran on Prime, Sun and VAX workstations) and Prime MEDUSA (which only ran on Prime computers at the time of acquisition, but which Prime subsequently ported to SunOS as Prime MEDUSA version 5.0). The two versions had a slightly different file format and the development language was developed in slightly different directions. The split in MEDUSA development was merged when Prime Computers acquired Computervision, with the promise to CV customers that VAX and Sun users would not be forced to switch to Prime workstations.

Prime was divided into the two main divisions: Prime Hardware, which was responsible for the proprietary computer hardware, and Prime Computervision, which was responsible for the CAD/CAM business with MEDUSA and CADDS. With falling hardware sales Prime eventually stopped production of PRIMOS computers and transferred its maintenance obligations to another company, thus being able to concentrate on the CAD/CAM software business. The company was renamed from Prime Computervision to Computervision (CV).

==Hardware==
Computervision created a GPU, Graphics Processing Unit, in 1980. It could traverse and render hierarchical display lists. It also produced a DCU, Display Control Unit, in 1983 with a large color raster display and attached rendering engine for basic UI operations.
In 1985, CV introduced an IBM 4361-based mainframe known as the CDS5000 to support Product Data Manager (PDM). This system never ran any graphics software but instead was used to manage the large number of product files and data that users were generating. The CDS5000 was networked with CDS4000 and CGP200X systems using serial links. PDM was later made platform independent and was offered on the original IBM platform, as well as DEC/VMS and Sun/Unix - opening up its CADDS workstations to run in conjunction with this range of host platforms for product data vaulting, access/security, revision control, backup/recovery, archive/restore features.

Computervision was crucial to Sun Microsystems development as a company. CV was Sun&#x27;s first large customer for Unix-based workstations. The CDS3000 series of workstations were actually Sun-2 systems with additional graphics hardware from CV. Ultimately in 1987, CV migrated from the CGP systems to Sun-3-based workstations known as CADDStations with a VME bus version of the GPU.

Computervision merged with Prime Computer in 1988 and acquired GE Calma (its major competitor in the microelectronic CAD market) in 1989. Computervision was acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) in 1998, which (as of 2013) still produces the CADDS5 product, although only as a CAD/CAM product specialized for shipbuilding. In 2001, PTC sold the MEDUSA and MPDS Plant Design System software rights to CAD Schroer, which has developed a Fourth Generation of each system.

==Customers==
One of the first major customers in the UK for ComputerVision were the construction company John Laing PLC. 
&quot;In 1975 John Laing purchased a ComputerVision CADDS3 computer aided design and drafting system to carry out investigations into the use of CAD in the construction engineering and building environment&quot; - Mervyn Richards, Laing Technology Group (Thomas Telford Press, Institute of Civil Engineers, Conference - )

Laing Design Partners, a division of John Laing, had for some time been sponsoring work at Imperial University on the use of CAD in construction in the early 1970s and this led to Laing choosing the ComputerVision platform.

At this time, Laing became the first CAD user in the UK Civil Engineering and Construction industry and were instrumental in developing and promoting the use of Computers in Construction.

Mervyn Richards, responsible for this initiative later became one of the industries leading experts in Computer Aided Design, Modeling and construction IT (see the BS1192 specification). His work with CADDS3, ComputerVision and Elstree Computing Limited lead to the development and distribution of many software tools for ComputerVision platforms, promoting their use and popularising the platform for many years - right up to CADDS5.

The Queen Alia Airport, by example, was a classic project to which these systems were used (by John Laing PLC). 
The first higher educational user of Computervision equipment was State University of New York College of Technology at Alfred, New York which acquired a CADDS3 system in 1979 with the help of a NSF grant and generous donation of equipment by Computervision employees Virgil Ross, Drew Davis and Bob Gothie. Alfred State graduated their first AAS Computer Graphics Engineering Technology (TAC/ABET) Graduates in 1983 with Martin Allen as the featured graduation speaker. The first graduating class of 18 students had over 75 job offers, launching a 20-year history of unparalleled placement success. One of the numerous &quot;firsts&quot; that was spun off the Alfred State program was a joint project with the New York State Department of Transportation, Region 6, to design highways and bridges and associated structures in 3-D CADDs which resulted in New York State being one of the first to use CADDS for highway design.

In 1981 the United States Navy awarded an “indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery contract valued at $63,000,000 for Designer V hardware, CADDS4 software, services, and training. Primarily used by the Navy Laboratories, in the 1985 time frame, CADDS was adopted by the Navy shipyards to support waterfront activities, and the Naval Sea Systems Command to support contract ship design. As of 2013, CADDS (by then CADDS5) continued in production as a CAD/CAM product specialized for shipbuilding.

<text>The Ansaldo armored car was a prototype armored fighting vehicle built by Ansaldo in 1925, based on a Pavesi P4 heavy tractor.

==Design==
The prototype was armed with a 45 mm / 37 mm cannon in a turret. It had four diameter wheels with wide tyres. 
The engine was at the front behind a radiator protected by armour plates. Poor visibility and driving difficulties led to abandonment of the project.

<text>Edmund Scientific Corporation, based in Barrington, New Jersey, was founded in 1942 as a retailer of surplus optical parts like lenses. It later branched out into complete systems like telescopes and microscopes, and in the 1960s, a wide variety of science toys and kits. Through the 1970s and 80s they were best known for their mail order sales and associated catalogs, although they also maintained a retail presence at their factory store.

In 1984, the company split into Edmund Scientific and Edmund Industrial Optics, the latter taking over their optical manufacturing. Later known simply as Edmund Optics, the commercial side of the company continued to expand and now has a multinational presence. In 2001, the two companies were purchased by Boreal Science, which was in turn purchased by VWR International. Many of the science toys and kits are currently offered by the online retailer Scientifics Direct.

Among the company&#x27;s best-known products were the Astroscan reflector telescope and their inexpensive bimetallic jumping disks.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1942, amateur photographer Norman W. Edmund (1916–2012) found it hard to find lenses he needed for his hobby. He found that the military was happy to sell off less-than-perfect optics for next to nothing and began using these. Buying in bulk, he began to sell his own surplus through advertisements in photography magazines. It was so successful he founded &quot;&#x27;Edmund Salvage Corporation&#x27;&quot; in 1942. Working from a card table in his home, the company soon had so much stock that they had to rent space in more than 30 separate garages.

===Post-war===
The business continued in the post-war era and owned so much stock that when the Korean War started the military came to him for the optics needed to repair war-era systems. One official told him, &quot;Gee, you have more optics than the Army!&quot; In 1948 they completed a new building and warehouse in Barrington and opened a retail store at the front. Among its displays was a complete periscope from a WWII Japanese submarine. The core of the company in this era remained surplus lenses. These were single-element lenses, shipped in coin envelopes, with the approximate diameter and focal length stenciled on them. Reflecting their salvage and surplus origins, available diameters and focal lengths did not fall into regular progressions. 

In addition to optics, the company soon branched out into various kits and plans for optics-related systems like telescopes and microscopes. It soon changed its name to Edmund Scientific and made its name with ads in publications like &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Its advertisements caught the attention of hobbyists, amateur astronomers, high school students, and cash-strapped researchers. The company also began publishing a series of pamphlets on telescopes in a do-it-yourself fashion that was popular in contemporary magazines like Popular Mechanics. These were later collected into book form in 1967, &quot;All About Telescopes&quot;, which contained many plans for telescope systems that became a best seller and was republished repeatedly into the 1980s.

===Heyday===

Following Sputnik, Edmund was able to capitalize on a growing national interest in science and astronomy. They expanded their business into a full line of telescopes and telescope kits as well as equipment, parts, and supplies for other scientific fields such as physics, optics, chemistry, microscopy, electronics, and meteorology. They continued to grow as a supplier to teachers and schools with demonstration devices and kits which covered most fields of science.

Edmund&#x27;s catered to the 1960s generation by expanding and highlighting their line of projectors, color wheels, black lights, filters, and other optical devices which could be used by rock bands and in psychedelic light shows. Other items catering to the counterculture were eventually added to the catalog covering the fields of Biofeedback, ESP, Kirlian photography, Pyramid power, and alternative energy.

In 1971, in the Whole Earth Catalog of items &quot;relevant to independent education&quot;, Stewart Brand noted: &quot;Edmund is the best source we know of for low-cost scientific gadgetry (including math and optics gear). [In this category,] many of the items we found independently... turned up in the Edmund catalog, so we were obliged to recommend that in this area we&#x27;ve been precluded.&quot;

The company became briefly famous in 1973 when Comet Kohoutek approached Earth and the company sold out of telescopes, a fact that made national news. Neil deGrasse Tyson would later comment that &quot;The Edmund Scientific catalog was a geek&#x27;s paradise. At a time when no one had access to lasers, they had them for sale.&quot;

Some sources claim that certain of the original polyhedral dice used in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game system were obtained from Edmund Scientific.

===Restructuring===
Norman W. Edmund retired in 1975 and left the company to his son, Robert. The company continued on as before into the 1980s, but the original business model began to wane. Robert split the company into Edmund Scientifics and Edmund Optics. Edmund Scientifics marketed to consumers and specialized in science-themed toys, vaguely high-tech household gadgets, and &quot;science gifts.&quot; Edmund Optics did not have a public showroom like Edmund Scientifics, although the two organizations shared the same building. The large back room of Edmund Scientifics still sold military surplus from World War II and other wars well into the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Some of the items in the surplus room were from German and other non-American militaries. None of these items were in the mail-order catalogs. They also sold other surplus wares of interest to hobbyists, including specialized motors and other miscellaneous electronics, parts from toys, and other household items.

===Acquisition===
In 2000 Edmund Scientific was purchased by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories, a western New York based science supply company. Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories is part of a group of companies that provide science supplies to elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as colleges and universities. This group falls under the unofficial umbrella &quot;VWR Education&quot;, and its constituent enterprises are owned by VWR International, a multi-national conglomerate with offices in India, China, Europe, Canada, and the United States. They are no longer affiliated with Edmund Optics Inc.

Beginning in 2000, Edmund Optics offered a variety of experimental grade and stock clearance items via a print catalog and online under a separate business named Anchor Optics, but this operation ceased in 2016, and the current Anchor Optics web site now redirects to a page at Edmund Optics listing clearance items.

In 2001, the Barrington, New Jersey, store closed after Edmund Scientific was acquired by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories.

As of 2009, online sales made up the bulk of Edmund Scientific&#x27;s revenues. The company was still selling telescopes (including an updated version of their Astroscan Telescope), microscopes (mostly they have carried the Boreal brand, manufactured for their parent company Science Kit LLC), surplus optics, magnets, and Fresnel lenses. They continued to sell many of their old favorites along with new items such as the Impossiball and hand boilers as well as other science-themed toys, novelty items, gifts, and gadgets.

As of 2017, Edmund Optics continued to offer brand-new stock optics, as well as offering custom and specialized optics to corporations and higher education institutions.

== In popular culture ==
Edmund Scientific has provided items used in television shows such as &quot;House&quot;, &quot;MythBusters&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;, and motion pictures such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and the 1975 version of &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot;. Wah Chang, the artist who designed and built several props in the 1960s for the Star Trek television show, used moiré patterns found in the Edmund Scientific Educator&#x27;s and Designer&#x27;s Moiré Kit for the texture used in the Starfleet communicator props.

In the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Two Bad Neighbors&quot;, Bart Simpson releases locusts from a box labeled &quot;Edmund Scientific&quot;.

<doc id="866362" wikidata="Q15265866" url="?curid=866362" title="Pendon Museum">
<text>Pendon Museum, located in Long Wittenham near Didcot, Oxfordshire, England, is a museum that displays scale models, in particular a large scene representing parts of the Vale of White Horse in the 1920s and 1930s. The scene, under construction since the 1950s and with parts dating back earlier, was inspired by detailed research into the architecture and landscape of the vale, with some models of cottages taking hundreds of hours to complete. The late Roye England, an anglophile Australian who lived in England, founded it, and ran it jointly with the late English Model Maker, Guy Williams, who made fifty-seven of the museum&#x27;s ninety locomotives.
They can be seen working together in the 1958 British Pathé short, &#x27;Hair Thatching&#x27;.
A group of volunteers runs the museum and it is open to the public most weekends and holidays, except during the winter. and Wednesdays during school holidays.

==History==
The museum was founded by the artist and craftsman Roye England, who was interested in model railways. He observed the destruction and modification of many historic buildings in the area and began to make model representations of them.

Both the main Vale scene and others display working scale model railway scale models of typical scenes on the Great Western Railway (GWR) of the 1920s. The trains are also representative in detail of those travelling that line in those years.

==Displays==

===Vale of White Horse===
The main display and ongoing project at Pendon is a scale representation of the Vale of White Horse as it was in the inter-war period. The scene is centred on the &#x27;typical&#x27; village of Pendon Parva, which is served by a railway station on the main London to Bristol GWR main line that runs through the Vale, and another on the M&amp;SWJR that became one of the constituent companies of the GWR in 1923. The topography and the village layout is fictional, but every building and significant feature is an exact model of a real building from the Vale of White Horse.

Some locos on the layout:
*GWR 2900 Class No. 2943 Hampton Court Built in 1912.
*GWR 4000 Class No. 4050 Princess Alice Built in 1914.
*GWR 2251 Class No. 2253 Built in 1930.
*LSWR N15 Class No. 789 Sir Guy Built in 1925.
*GWR 3700 Class No. 3705 Mauritius
*LSWR S15 class No. 515 Built in 1921.

===Dartmoor branch===
On the ground floor of the museum, a model representing a Great Western Railway branch line on Dartmoor, originally built in 1955 to showcase the trains being built for the Vale scene, is operated for visitors. The main focus of the Dartmoor scene is a model of Brunel&#x27;s timber viaduct at Walkham in Devon built by R. Guy Williams, who also built many of the model locomotives at the museum.

Locos on the layout include:
*GWR 2900 Class No. 2921 Saint Dunstan Built in 1907.
*GWR 2800 Class No. 2844 Built in 1912.
*LSWR M7 Class No. 30 Built in 1904

===Madder Valley===
The museum includes displays of individual models, modelling methods and railway artefacts. It also displays &quot;Madder Valley&quot;, a pioneering model railway built by John Ahern.

==Models==
The model trains are hand built, to represent individual locomotives, carriages, and wagons as exactly possible, based on surviving records and photographs. Operation consists of a sequence of trains, showing what one could have seen passing by on a summer day and night, in the mid-1920s. This sequence is based on timetables of the period. They are all modelled in 4 mm to 1 foot scale (1:76), and run on track of 18mm gauge, a combination known as EM gauge.

<text>Robert Ferdinand Wagner II (April 20, 1910 – February 12, 1991) was an American diplomat and politician who served three terms as the mayor of New York City from 1954 through 1965. When running for his third term, he broke with the Tammany Hall leadership, ending the clubhouse&#x27;s reign in city politics. He also served as United States Ambassador to Spain and in a number of other offices.

==Early life and career==
Wagner was born in Yorkville, Manhattan, the son of Margaret Marie (McTague) and German-born United States Senator Robert Ferdinand Wagner. He attended Taft School and graduated from Yale University in 1933, where he was on the business staff of campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot; and became a member of Scroll and Key (as was John Lindsay, his successor as mayor). He attended Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of International Studies in Geneva. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1937.

Wagner was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 16th D.) in 1938, 1939–40 and 1941–42. He resigned his seat on January 13, 1942, and joined the Army Air Corps to fight in World War II, where he served as an intelligence officer. Wagner held the rank of lieutenant colonel with the 19th Tactical Air Command and was awarded a Bronze Star Medal. After the war, he served as City Tax Commissioner, Commissioner of Housing and Buildings, and Chairman of the City Planning Commission. He was Borough President of Manhattan from 1950 to 1953. He also served as delegate to numerous Democratic conventions, and was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1956.

==Mayor==
Although New York City Comptroller Lazarus Joseph usually sided in the New York City Board of Estimate with Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri during the latter&#x27;s term in office, Joseph supported Wagner for the Democratic nomination for mayor in the 1953 primary election, calling Wagner a &quot;sure winner.&quot;

His nomination and election as New York City mayor in 1953 caused a rift in the Democratic Party, and instigated a long-standing feud between Eleanor Roosevelt and Carmine DeSapio, Boss of Tammany Hall. Roosevelt was a Wagner supporter, and DeSapio offered only reluctant support to Wagner until 1961, when Wagner ran for a third term on an anti-Tammany platform, which eventually helped end DeSapio&#x27;s leadership.

During Wagner&#x27;s tenure as New York City&#x27;s mayor, he built public housing and schools, created the City University of New York system, established the right of collective bargaining for city employees, and barred housing discrimination based on race, creed, or color. He was the first mayor to hire significant numbers of people of color in city government. His administration also saw the development of Lincoln Center and brought Shakespeare to Central Park. In the fall of 1957 after the Dodgers and Giants left New York City he appointed a commission to determine whether New York City could host another National League baseball team, eventually leading to the Mets franchise being awarded to New York City.

During his years in office, the city experienced the visit of a number of notables from around the world. In January 1957, President Eisenhower invited King Saud to the United States to discuss strategies for resolving the Suez crisis. Wagner refused Eisenhower&#x27;s request of a ticker tape parade for the King and even refused to greet him formally, stating that the Muslim ruler was anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic, which was judged by some observers as &quot;a crude appeal to the prejudices of the hyphenated voters.&quot; He did greet Queen Elizabeth II later in 1957. He also rearranged his schedule to meet with the Little Rock Nine and give them a tour of New York City Hall.

In 1956, Wagner ran on the Democratic and Liberal tickets for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Republican Jacob K. Javits. In 1957 and 1958, Wagner served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

Like his father, Wagner was aligned with Tammany Hall for much of his career. However, when he sought a third term in 1961, Wagner broke with DeSapio and won the Democratic primary anyway, beginning the decline of machine politics in New York City.

By the early 1960s, Wagner became concerned about the image of New York City in preparation for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair and began a controversial campaign to rid New York City of gay bars. The city revoked the bars&#x27; liquor licenses and used undercover police officers to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.

In February 1962, Wagner quit the New York Athletic Club because it barred African Americans and Jews from becoming members.

The New York Preservation Archive Project described Wagner&#x27;s contribution to preservation as &quot;complex.&quot; While he saved Carnegie Hall from demolition in 1960, he was also mayor at the time of the controversial demolition of the original Penn Station, which began on October 28, 1963. In 1965, he signed the law that created the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

In 1965, Wagner decided not to run for a fourth term as mayor. Four years later, however, he ran for mayor again, but lost the Democratic primary. In 1973, he talked with the city&#x27;s five Republican county chairmen about running for Mayor as a Republican, but these negotiations collapsed.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists, and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Wagner as the seventeenth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

==Ambassador==
After deciding not to run for a fourth term in 1965, Wagner served as ambassador to Spain from June 1968 to March 1969. In that year, he decided to run for a fourth term but was soundly beaten by Mario Procaccino in the Democratic primary. He also made a brief run four years later, but withdrew before the primary took place. In 1978 he was appointed by Jimmy Carter to be his representative to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals had recently elected John Paul II.

==Personal life==
Wagner was a Roman Catholic.

Wagner&#x27;s first wife was Susan Edwards, by whom he had two sons, Robert Ferdinand Wagner III and Duncan. Susan Wagner died of lung cancer in 1964. By all accounts, the two had a very happy marriage, and although Susan was not particularly fond of politics, she enjoyed traveling with her husband and meeting many famous people. Susan was described as optimistic, cheerful, kind, and always happy. According to his friends, Mayor Wagner was &quot;lonely and depressed&quot; after the death of his first wife.

He married Barbara Cavanagh in 1965. They divorced in 1971. Wagner married Phyllis Fraser, widow of Bennett Cerf, in 1975. They lived together until his death in 1991. Her five-floor townhouse at 132 East 62nd Street, designed by Denning &amp; Fourcade, &quot;was so magnetic that the statesman moved in.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
He died in Manhattan of heart failure in 1991, aged 80, while he was being treated for bladder cancer. His funeral mass was offered by Cardinal William Wakefield Baum at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens. &quot;Mr. Wagner was buried beside the graves of his father, United States Senator Robert F. Wagner, and mother, Margaret, and first wife, Susan Edwards Wagner, and not far from the grave of New York&#x27;s Governor Al Smith.&quot;

The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University is named in his honor, as is the Robert F. Wagner Jr. Park in Battery Park City and the Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology in Long Island City.

Wagner&#x27;s papers, photographs, artifacts and other materials are housed at the New York City Municipal Archives and at La Guardia and Wagner Archives.

<doc id="866367" wikidata="Q267380" url="?curid=866367" title="Anglo-Persian Oil Company">
<text>The Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC; ) was a British company founded in 1909 following the discovery of a large oil field in Masjed Soleiman, Persia (Iran). The British government purchased 51% of the company in 1914, gaining a controlling number of shares, effectively nationalizing the company. It was the first company to extract petroleum from Iran. In 1935 APOC was renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) when Reza Shah formally asked foreign countries to refer to Persia by its endonym &quot;Iran&quot;.

In 1954, it was renamed again to The British Petroleum Company, one of the antecedents of the modern BP public limited company. The government of Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the company&#x27;s local infrastructure assets and gave the new company the name National Iranian Oil Company.

== The D&#x27;Arcy oil concession ==
=== Exploration and discovery ===

In 1901, William Knox D&#x27;Arcy, a millionaire London socialite, negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar of Persia. He financed this with capital he had made from his shares in the highly profitable Mount Morgan Mine in Queensland, Australia. D&#x27;Arcy assumed exclusive rights to prospect for oil for 60 years in a vast tract of territory including most of Persia. In exchange the Shah received £20,000 (£ million today), an equal amount in shares of D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s company, and a promise of 16% of future profits.
D&#x27;Arcy hired geologist George Bernard Reynolds to do the prospecting in the Persian desert. Conditions were extremely harsh: &quot;small pox raged, bandits and warlords ruled, water was all but unavailable, and temperatures often soared past 50°C&quot;. After several years of prospecting, D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s fortune dwindled away and he was forced to sell most of his rights to a Glasgow-based syndicate, the Burmah Oil Company.

By 1908, having sunk more than £500,000 into their Persian venture and found no oil, D&#x27;Arcy and Burmah decided to abandon exploration in Persia. In early May 1908, they sent Reynolds a telegram telling him that they had run out of money and ordering him to &quot;cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost of transporting to the coast for re-shipment, and come home.&quot; Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after, on 26 May 1908. However, according to Arnold Wilson, &quot;The service rendered by G.B. Reynolds to the British empire and to British industry and to Persia was never recognized.&quot;

===Creation of APOC===
On 14 April 1909, Burmah Oil created the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) as a subsidiary and also sold shares to the public.
Volume production of Persian oil products eventually started in 1913 from a refinery built at Abadan, for its first 50 years the largest oil refinery in the world (see Abadan Refinery). In 1913, shortly before World War I, APOC managers negotiated with a new customer, Winston Churchill, who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill, as a part of a three-year expansion program, sought to modernise Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy by abandoning the use of coal-fired steamships and adopting oil as fuel for its ships instead. Although Britain had large reserves of coal, oil had the advantage of greater energy density, allowing a longer steaming range for a ship for the same bunker capacity. Furthermore, Churchill wanted to free Britain from its reliance on the Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell oil companies. In exchange for secure oil supplies for its ships, the British government injected new capital into the company and, in doing so, acquired a controlling interest in APOC. The contract that was set up between the British Government and APOC was to hold for 20 years. The British government also became a de facto hidden power behind the oil company.

APOC took a 50% share in a new Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) organised in 1912 by Calouste Gulbenkian to explore and develop oil resources in the Ottoman Empire. After a hiatus caused by World War I, it reformed and struck an immense gusher at Kirkuk, Iraq in 1927, renaming itself the Iraq Petroleum Company.

In 1920, the APOC also acquired a northern oil concession that had been formally granted in 1916 to a former Russian subject, the Georgian Akaki Khoshtaria. To manage this new acquisition, the APOC formed a new subsidiary, the North Persia Oil Company. Persia, however, refused to accept the new company, giving rise to a lingering dispute over the northern Persian oil.

In 1923, oil was found at the Iraqi/Persian border in Naft Khana/Naft-i-Shah (now Diyala Province), which was considered a &quot;transferred territory&quot; along the Persia-Iraq border. The Khanaqin Oil Company was registered in London as an APOC subsidiary. The quantities henceforth produced in the field were rather insignificant. Naft Khana reverted to the Iraqi government in 1958 after failing to achieve a contractual obligation of 40,000 bbl/day.

During this period, Persian popular opposition to the D&#x27;Arcy oil concession and royalty terms whereby Persia only received 16% of net profits was widespread. Since industrial development and planning, as well as other fundamental reforms were predicated on oil revenues, the government&#x27;s lack of control over the oil industry served to accentuate the Persian government&#x27;s misgivings regarding the manner in which APOC conducted its affairs in Persia. Such a pervasive atmosphere of dissatisfaction seemed to suggest that a radical revision of the concession terms would be possible. Moreover, owing to the introduction of reforms that improved fiscal order in Persia, APOC&#x27;s past practice of cutting off advances in oil royalties when its demands were not met had lost much of its sting.

In 1923, Burmah employed Winston Churchill as a paid consultant to lobby the British government to allow APOC to have exclusive rights to Persian oil resources, which were subsequently granted. In 1925, TPC received concession in the Mesopotamian oil resources from the Iraqi government under British mandate. TPC finally struck oil in Iraq on 14 October 1927. In 1928, the APOC&#x27;s shareholding in TPC, which by now was named Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), would be reduced to 23.75%; as the result of the changing geopolitics post Ottoman Empire break-up, and the Red Line Agreement. AIOC was a 50% co-owner and responsible for the operation of the refinery completed in 1939 at the Haifa terminal of the IPC-owned Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline.

===Renegotiating of terms by Iran===

The attempt to revise the terms of the oil concession on a more favourable basis for Persia led to protracted negotiations that took place in Tehran, Lausanne, London and Paris between Abdolhossein Teymourtash, Persia/Iran&#x27;s Minister of Court 1925–32 and its nominal Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Chairman of APOC, John Cadman, spanned 1928–32. The overarching argument for revisiting the terms of the D&#x27;Arcy Agreement on the Persian side was that its national wealth was being squandered by a concession that was granted in 1901 by a previous non-constitutional government forced to agree to inequitable terms under duress. In order to buttress his position in talks with the British, Teymourtash retained the expertise of French and Swiss oil experts.

Persia demanded a revision of the terms whereby Persia would be granted 25% of APOC&#x27;s total shares. To counter British objections, Teymourtash would state that &quot;if this had been a new concession, the Persian Government would have insisted not on 25 percent but on a 50–50 basis. Teymourtash also asked for a minimum guaranteed interest of 12.5% on dividends from the shares of the company, plus 2s per ton of oil produced. In addition, he specified that the company was to reduce the existing area of the concession. The intent behind reducing the area of the concession was to push APOC operations to the southwest of the country so as to make it possible for Persia to approach and lure other oil companies to develop oilfields on more equitable terms in areas not part of APOC&#x27;s area of concession.

Apart from demanding a more equitable share of the profits of the company, an issue that did not escape Teymourtash&#x27;s attention was that the flow of transactions between APOC and its various subsidiaries deprived Iran of gaining an accurate and reliable appreciation of APOC&#x27;s full profits. As such, he demanded that the company register itself in Tehran as well as London, and the exclusive rights of transportation of the oil be returned to the Iranian government. In fact in the midst of the negotiations in 1930, the Iranian National Consultative Assembly approved a bill whereby foreign companies would be required to pay a 4 percent tax on prospective profits earned in Iran.

In 1931, Teymourtash who was travelling to Europe to enroll Crown Prince Mohammed Reza Pahlavi at a Swiss boarding school, decided to use the occasion to attempt to conclude the negotiations. According to Cadman, Teymourtash worked feverishly and diligently to resolve all outstanding issues, but succeeded only in securing an agreement in principle while key figures and lump sum payments were not settled.

However, while Teymourtash was led to believe that after four years of exhaustive and detailed discussions, he had succeeded in navigating the negotiations on the road to a conclusive end; the latest negotiations in London were to prove nothing more than a cul de sac.

Matters came to a head in 1931, when the combined effects of over-abundant oil supplies on the global markets and the economic destabilization of the Great Depression, led to fluctuations which drastically reduced annual payments accruing to Iran to a fifth of what it had received in the previous year. In that year APOC informed the Iranian government that its royalties for the year would amount to a mere £366,782 while in the same period the company&#x27;s income taxes paid to the British government amounted to approximately £1,000,000. Furthermore, while the company&#x27;s profits declined 36 percent for the year, the revenues paid to the Iranian government pursuant to the company&#x27;s accounting practices decreased by 76 percent. Such a precipitous drop in royalties appeared to confirm suspicions of bad faith, and Teymourtash indicated that the parties would have to revisit negotiations.

However, Reza Shah was soon to assert his authority by dramatically inserting himself into the negotiations. The monarch attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers in November 1932, and after publicly rebuking Teymourtash for his failure to secure an agreement, dictated a letter to cabinet cancelling the D&#x27;Arcy Agreement. The Iranian government notified APOC that it would cease further negotiations and demanded cancellation of the D&#x27;Arcy concession. Rejecting the cancellation, the British government espoused the claim on behalf of APOC and brought the dispute before the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, asserting that it regarded itself &quot;as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the Company&#x27;s protection.&quot; The Permanent Court of International Justice was a tool of the League of Nations which, in turn, was dominated by the victors of World War I. At this point, Hassan Taqizadeh, had been appointed the new Iranian Minister entrusted with the task of assuming responsibility for the oil dossier. In modern political history, Taqizadeh is known as a secular politician who believed that &quot;outwardly and inwardly, in body and in spirit, Iran must become Europeanized&quot;. Taqizadeh was to intimate to the British that the cancellation was simply meant to expedite negotiations and that it would constitute political suicide for Iran to withdraw from negotiations.

After the dispute between the two countries was taken up at the Hague, the Czech Foreign Minister who was appointed mediator put the matter into abeyance to allow the contending parties to attempt to resolve the dispute. Ironically, Reza Shah who had stood firm in demanding the abolishment of the D&#x27;Arcy concession, suddenly acquiesced to British demands, much to the chagrin and disappointment of his Cabinet. A new agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was agreed to after Cadman visited Iran in April 1933 and was granted a private audience with the Shah. A new agreement was ratified by the National Consultative Assembly on May 28, 1933, and received Royal assent the following day.

===1933 agreement===
According to Daniel Yergin, &quot;By the end of April 1933, a new agreement was finally forged. The concession area was reduced by three-quarters. Persia was guaranteed a fixed royalty of four shillings per ton, which protected it against fluctuations in oil prices. At the same time, it would receive 20 percent of the company&#x27;s worldwide profits that were actually distributed to shareholders above a certain minimum sum. In addition, a minimum annual payment of £750,000, irrespective of other developments, was guaranteed. The royalties for 1931 and 1932 were to be recalculated on the new basis, and the &#x27;Persianization&#x27; of the workforce was to be accelerated. Meanwhile, the duration of the concession was extended from 1961 to 1993.&quot; By 1950, Abadan had become the world&#x27;s largest refinery.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company continued its large Persian operations although it changed its name to the AIOC in 1935. In spite of diversification the AIOC still relied heavily on its Iranian oil fields for three-quarters of its supplies, and controlled all oil in Iran.

==Nationalisation and coup==

===Discontent in Iran===
Under the 1933 agreement with Reza Shah, the AIOC promised to give labourers better pay, more chances for advancement, build schools, hospitals, roads and a telephone system. AIOC did not fulfill these promises.

In August 1941, the Allied powers Britain and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Iran in order to secure the oilfields and open a secure supply route to the USSR. The Persian Corridor sent over 4 million tonnes of American Lend-Lease and other materiel alone. Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favour of his young son who they perceived would be far less able to act against their interests.

Following World War II, nationalistic sentiments were on the rise in the Middle East, the most notable example being Iranian nationalism. AIOC and the pro-western Iranian government led by Prime Minister Ali Razmara, initially resisted nationalist pressure to revise AIOC&#x27;s concession terms still further in Iran&#x27;s favour. In May 1949, Britain offered a &quot;Supplemental oil agreement&quot; to appease unrest in the country. The agreement guaranteed royalty payments would not drop below £4 million, reduced the area in which it would be allowed to drill, and promised more Iranians would be trained for administrative positions. The agreement, however, gave Iran neither a &quot;greater voice in company&#x27;s management&quot;, nor the right to audit the company books. In addition, Iranian royalties from oil were not expected to ever drop to the proposed guarantee of £4 million and the reduced area covered all of the productive oilfields. When the Iranian Prime Minister tried to argue with AIOC head Sir William Fraser, Fraser &quot;dismissed him&quot; and flew back to the UK.

In late December 1950, word reached Tehran that the American-owned Arabian American Oil Company had agreed to share profits with Saudis on a 50-50 basis. The UK Foreign Office rejected the idea of any similar agreement for AIOC.

On 7 March 1951, Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara was assassinated by the Fada&#x27;iyan-e Islam, a Shia terrorist organization that supported nationalization of the AIOC. As Prime Minister, Razmara successfully resisted efforts by the pro-nationalization opposition party, the National Front. The public&#x27;s discontent over the lack of progress regarding the AIOC and the D&#x27;Arcy concession became even more apparent from the obvious lack of mourning for Razmara. A raucous protest walkout by newspaper reporters ensued when a visiting American diplomat urged &quot;reason as well as enthusiasm&quot; to deal with the imminent British embargo against Iran.

By 1951, Iranian support for nationalisation of the AIOC was intense. Grievances included the small fraction of revenues Iran received. In 1947 for example, the AIOC reported after-tax profits of £40 million ($112 million), but the agreement entitled Iran to just £7 million, 17.5% of profits. Britain was profiting far more off Iranian oil than Iran was. In addition, conditions for Iranian oil workers and their families were poor. The director of Iran&#x27;s Petroleum Institute wrote:

===Nationalisation===

Later in March 1951, the Iranian parliament, the Majlis, voted to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) and its holdings. In April, Mohammed Mossadegh, leader of the National Front and a champion of nationalisation, was elected prime minister; sparking the Abadan Crisis.

Mossadegh broke off negotiations with the AIOC in July 1951, after the AIOC threatened to pull its employees out of Iran, and Britain warned tanker owners that &quot;the receipts from the Iranian government would not be accepted on the world market.&quot; The British ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranian government and drew up a detailed plan of an invasion to occupy Abadan, code named &quot;Buccaneer&quot;. That plan was ultimately rejected by both Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill. US President Harry S. Truman and US ambassador to Iran Henry F. Grady opposed intervention in Iran but needed Britain&#x27;s support for the Korean War.

The United States believed it was possible to reach a face-saving agreement with Mossadegh, under which actual control and management of the organisation would remain with the AIOC. Truman sent Averell Harriman to Iran to convince Mossadegh of such a scheme. Arriving in Tehran on 15 July 1951, Harriman claimed that the United States accepted nationalization of the concession but insisted on having &quot;a foreign-owned company to act as an agent of NIOC in conducting operations in Iran&quot;. Harriman&#x27;s British counterpart the Lord Privy Seal, Richard Stokes, signaled the UK also favoured such an arrangement. Mossadegh however adamantly opposed the idea, believing it would only &quot;revive the former AIOC in a new form.&quot; Mossadegh&#x27;s opposition caused the British to conclude that he had to go. Officials at the Ministry of Fuel and Power wrote in September 1951:

In October 1951, Mossadegh paid a visit to the United States, after the US embassy in Tehran had accidentally invited him (the invitation was actually meant for Churchill). There, in discussions with George C. McGhee, Mossadegh surprisingly agreed to a complex settlement, under which Iran would own the refinery in Kermanshah and administer the oilfields. The much larger Abadan Refinery was sold to a non-British company and the proceeds given to the AIOC as compensation. Further, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would sell an annual minimum of 30 million tons of crude oil to the AIOC for the next fifteen years. The board of the NIOC would consist of three Iranians and four foreigners and would conduct most of its transactions using in sterling. Mossadegh prolonged his visit on Washington&#x27;s urging because the US administration believed that the incoming Conservative government of Winston Churchill would be agreeable to that deal. However, the deal was rejected by the British, who believed Mossadegh&#x27;s downfall was imminent. Several major oil companies, such as Socony-Vacuum and Shell, assured the Ministry of Fuel and Power that they were also opposed to the agreement.

Britain attempted to settle the dispute through the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran contended that the issue lay outside the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. On 22 July 1952, &quot;the court accepted the Iranian argument that the dispute was between the Iranian government and a foreign corporation, not the British government; since the dispute was not about a treaty or convention with a foreign government, it was subject to Iranian domestic law&quot;.

As the months went on, the crisis became acute. By mid-1952, an attempt by the Shah to replace Mossadegh backfired, and led to riots against the Shah and perceived foreign intervention. After that, Mossadegh returned with even greater prestige. At the same time however, his coalition was weakening, because Britain’s boycott/blockade of Iranian oil exports eliminated a major source of state revenue; many Iranians grew poorer and thus unhappier by the day.

===Coup===
Mossadegh expelled the British embassy in October 1952, checking further efforts by the UK government to internally undermine his regime. Britain appealed to US anti-communist sentiment, depicting both Mossadegh and Iran as unstable and likely to fall under communist influence as they continued to weaken. It was alleged that if Iran fell, the &quot;enormous assets&quot; of &quot;Iranian oil production and reserves&quot; would come under communist control, as would &quot;in short order the other areas of the Middle East&quot;.

The anti-Mossadegh plan was orchestrated by the CIA under the code-name &#x27;Operation Ajax&#x27;, and by SIS (MI6) as &#x27;Operation Boot&#x27;. The CIA utilized information obtain from British intelligence and bribed politicians, soldiers, mobsters, and journalists to destabilize the country and consolidate opposition to Mosaddegh. The Shah re-asserted his position and forcefully removed Mosaddegh from office. General Fazlollah Zahedi led tanks to Mosaddegh&#x27;s residence and arrested him for treason. On 21 December 1953, Mosaddegh was sentenced three years&#x27; solitary confinement in a military prison, well short of the death sentence requested by prosecutors. He was then kept under house arrest at his Ahmadabad residence, until his death on 5 March 1967.

=== Consortium ===
With a pro-Western Shah and the new pro-Western Prime Minister, Fazlollah Zahedi, Iranian oil began flowing again and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which changed its name to British Petroleum (BP) in 1954, tried to return to its old position. However, Iranian public opinion was so opposed that the new government could not permit it.

Under pressure from the United States, BP was forced to accept membership in a consortium of companies which would bring Iranian oil back on the international market. BP was incorporated in London in 1954 as a holding company called Iranian Oil Participants Ltd (IOP). The founding members of IOP included British Petroleum (40%), Gulf Oil (8%), Royal Dutch Shell (14%), and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (now TotalEnergies SE, 6%). The four Aramco partners — Standard Oil of California (SoCal, later Chevron), Standard Oil of New Jersey (later Exxon), Standard Oil Co. of New York (later Mobil), and Texaco – each held an 8% stake in the holding company. In addition, these companies paid Anglo-Iranian about $90 million for their 60 percent share in the consortium, and a further $500 million, paid out of a ten cent per barrel royalty. The Shah signed the agreement on 29 October 1954, and oil flowed from Abadan the next day. Within a few months each of the American companies contributed 1 percent to Iricon, a consortium made up of nine independent American companies, which included Phillips, Richfield, Standard of Ohio, and Ashland.

The founding members of the IOP at various stages came to be known as the Supermajors, the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, or the &quot;Consortium for Iran&quot; cartel, and dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Until the oil crisis of 1973, the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world&#x27;s known oil reserves.

All IOP members acknowledged that the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) owned the oil and facilities in Iran, and IOP&#x27;s role was to operate and manage them on behalf of NIOC. To facilitate that, IOP established two operating entities incorporated in the Netherlands, and both were delegated to NIOC. Similar to the Saudi-Aramco &quot;50/50&quot; agreement of 1950, the consortium agreed to share profits on a 50–50 basis with Iran, &quot;but not to open its books to Iranian auditors or to allow Iranians onto its board of directors.&quot; The negotiations leading to the creation of the consortium, during 1954–55, was considered as a feat of skillful diplomacy for the Seven Sisters. Some viewed the move as leading to rising tensions with Iran, since it allowed IOP to divert and hide profits with ease—effectively controlling Iran&#x27;s share of the profits.

==Subsidiary companies==

==Tanker fleet==
The British Tanker Company Limited (BTC) was formed in 1915, after the Anglo-Persian Oil Company decided to become a fully self-contained operation, directly owning a fleet of tankers for sea transport. On formation, the BTC had an initial budget of $144,000 with which to build seven steam-powered tankers. The Company&#x27;s first tanker was the &quot;British Emperor&quot;, which was launched in 1916. The names of the first seven ships, and all later additions to the fleet, bore the prefix British.

Over the next decade, the demand for oil grew throughout the developed world, and the BTC expanded accordingly. By 1924, the fleet numbered 60 ships, with the 60th being the flagship, 10,762 deadweight tonnes (dwt), &quot;British Aviator&quot;. She was the BTC’s first diesel engine oil tanker, and at that time the most powerful single-screw motor ship in the world.

The economic depression of the early 1930s saw rising unemployment amongst merchant navies around the world. However, the BTC undertook a series of strategic mergers, and coupled with the continued support of the Shah of Iran, the APOC succeeded in strengthening its position within the industry.

In 1939, the British government chartered the whole fleet of 93 tankers to supply fuel to its armed forces during the Second World War. The fleet lost a total of 42 ships sunk during the war.

Within a year of peace in 1945, the BTC fleet had returned to its pre-war total of 93 vessels. The recovery continued with the building of 57 new tankers, each 12,000 dwt, which increased the tonnage of oil transported from Abadan refinery in Iran, whilst remaining light enough for the tankers to pass through the shallow waters of the Suez Canal.

In 1946, Princess Elizabeth launched the tanker &quot;British Princess&quot; for the APOC, and was given a sapphire brooch to mark the occasion.

In 1951, however, the situation changed dramatically, when the Iranian oil industry was nationalised, and the APOC removed all its staff from Iran.

<doc id="866375" wikidata="Q345970" url="?curid=866375" title="John Doyle (soccer, born 1966)">
<text>John Joseph Doyle (born March 16, 1966) is an American former professional soccer player who played professionally in both Europe and the United States including the Western Soccer League, American Professional Soccer League and Major League Soccer. He was the 1995 A-League Defender of the Year and the 1996 MLS Defender of the Year. He also earned fifty-three caps with the U.S. national team between 1987 and 1994 including two games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He was a member of the U.S. team at the 1988 Summer Olympics and was most recently the general manager of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer before resigning on August 29, 2016.

== Youth ==

Doyle attended Washington High School in Fremont, California where he played on the boys&#x27; soccer team. The team won the league championship Doyle&#x27;s senior year. At the end of his senior year, he held the school&#x27;s scoring record and had been named All-League each year he played. Doyle was named Athlete of the Decade for the 1980s. Doyle also played soccer with the Fremont City youth soccer club where he was a four-time state champion. After high school, he attended the University of San Francisco where he played college soccer. He was a 1986 second team All-American. He was inducted into the University of San Francisco Hall of Fame in 1999 and named a Legend of the Hilltop in 2005.

== Professional ==

=== Western Soccer League ===

In 1987, Doyle spent the collegiate off-season with the San Jose Earthquakes of the Western Soccer League. In 1989 and 1990, he also played for the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks during the college soccer off-season. In 1989, he was named to the WSL All-Star team.

=== Europe ===

In 1990, he moved to Europe where he signed with Swedish club Örgryte IS. In 1992, he returned to the Blackhawks for six games during the summer. In 1993, he played for German First Division club VfB Leipzig. Leipzig had won promotion to the First Division in 1993, but lasted only one year there, finishing last in 1994 and being demoted to the Second Division for the next season.

=== Return to the U.S. ===
With the demotion of Leipzig, Doyle signed with Major League Soccer (MLS). However, when the league delayed its first season to 1996, Doyle joined the Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League on loan from MLS for their inaugural season. The Ruckus developed their team around Doyle and the defense, which led the team to the league&#x27;s championship game where the Ruckus lost to the Seattle Sounders. Doyle was selected to the league All-Star team and was named the league Defender of the Year.

In order to ensure an initial equitable distribution of talent to each of the league&#x27;s new teams, MLS allocated well-known players. Doyle was allocated to the San Jose Clash. Doyle became the first player, and first-team captain, in the Clash&#x27;s history in 1996. He was then named MLS&#x27;s first Defender of the Year. Doyle scored eleven goals and had fifteen assists in his time in the league.

== National and Olympic teams ==

The U.S. Olympic team called in Doyle for a May 30, 1987, qualification match against Canada. The U.S. had lost 2–0 to Canada a week earlier and needed to win by that margin or greater to continue qualification. The team rose to the challenge and defeated Canada 3–0. Doyle continued to play with the Olympic team, including its three games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. In those games, he scored a goal in the 4–2 loss to the Soviet Union. He would continue to play for the national team in 1989, when the U.S. began qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He played two games for the U.S. at the finals.

== Post playing career ==

After his retirement from the Earthquakes, Doyle worked as a TV and radio color commentator for the team. In 2004, he was hired as assistant coach, replacing Dominic Kinnear who was promoted to head coach after Frank Yallop&#x27;s departure to coach the Canada national team. He stayed on until the franchise was relocated to Houston for the 2006 season. On October 3, 2007, he was named the new general manager of the Earthquakes. Doyle was fired by the Earthquakes on August 29, 2016.

Doyle is also the Director of Coaching of Mustang Soccer League, in Danville, California.

<doc id="866377" wikidata="Q131238" url="?curid=866377" title="Bacillus subtilis">
<text>Bacillus subtilis (), known also as the hay bacillus or grass bacillus, is a gram-positive, catalase-positive bacterium, found in soil and the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, humans and marine sponges. As a member of the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot;, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is rod-shaped, and can form a tough, protective endospore, allowing it to tolerate extreme environmental conditions. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has historically been classified as an obligate aerobe, though evidence exists that it is a facultative anaerobe. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is considered the best studied Gram-positive bacterium and a model organism to study bacterial chromosome replication and cell differentiation. It is one of the bacterial champions in secreted enzyme production and used on an industrial scale by biotechnology companies.

==Description==
&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; is a Gram-positive bacterium, rod-shaped and catalase-positive. It was originally named &quot;Vibrio subtilis&quot; by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, and renamed &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; by Ferdinand Cohn in 1872 (subtilis being the Latin for &quot;fine, thin, slender&quot;). &quot;B. subtilis&quot; cells are typically rod-shaped, and are about 4–10 micrometers (μm) long and 0.25–1.0 μm in diameter, with a cell volume of about 4.6 fL at stationary phase.

As with other members of the genus &quot;Bacillus&quot;, it can form an endospore, to survive extreme environmental conditions of temperature and desiccation. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is a facultative anaerobe and had been considered as an obligate aerobe until 1998. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is heavily flagellated, which gives it the ability to move quickly in liquids.

&quot;B. subtilis&quot; has proven highly amenable to genetic manipulation, and has become widely adopted as a model organism for laboratory studies, especially of sporulation, which is a simplified example of cellular differentiation. In terms of popularity as a laboratory model organism, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is often considered as the Gram-positive equivalent of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, an extensively studied Gram-negative bacterium.

==Characteristics==
Colony, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; are shown in the Table below.

Note: + = Positive, – = Negative

==Habitat==
This species is commonly found in the upper layers of the soil and &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is thought to be a normal gut commensal in humans. A 2009 study compared the density of spores found in soil (about 106 spores per gram) to that found in human feces (about 104 spores per gram). The number of spores found in the human gut was too high to be attributed solely to consumption through food contamination. In some bee habitats, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; appears in the gut flora of honey bees. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; can also be found in marine environments.

There is evidence that &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is saprophytic in nature. Studies have shown that the bacterium exhibits vegetative growth in soil rich in organic matter, and that spores were formed when nutrients were depleted. Additionally, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has been shown to form biofilms on plant roots, which might explain why it is commonly found in gut microbiomes. Perhaps animals eating plants with &quot;B. subtilis&quot; biofilms can foster growth of the bacterium in their gastrointestinal tract. It has been shown that the entire lifecycle of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; can be completed in the gastrointestinal tract, which provides credence to the idea that the bacterium enters the gut via plant consumption and stays present as a result of its ability to grow in the gut.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; can divide symmetrically to make two daughter cells (binary fission), or asymmetrically, producing a single endospore that can remain viable for decades and is resistant to unfavourable environmental conditions such as drought, salinity, extreme pH, radiation, and solvents. The endospore is formed at times of nutritional stress and through the use of hydrolysis, allowing the organism to persist in the environment until conditions become favourable. Prior to the process of sporulation the cells might become motile by producing flagella, take up DNA from the environment, or produce antibiotics. These responses are viewed as attempts to seek out nutrients by seeking a more favourable environment, enabling the cell to make use of new beneficial genetic material or simply by killing off competition. 

Under stressful conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; undergoes the process of sporulation. This process has been very well studied and has served as a model organism for studying sporulation.

===Sporulation===
Once &quot;B. subtilis&quot; commits to sporulation, the sigma factor sigma F is secreted. This factor promotes sporulation. A sporulation septum is formed and a chromosome is slowly moved into the forespore. When a third of one chromosome copy is in the forespore and the remaining two thirds is in the mother cell, the chromosome fragment in the forespore contains the locus for sigma F, which begins to be expressed in the forespore. In order to prevent sigma F expression in the mother cell, an anti-sigma factor, which is encoded by spoIIAB, is expressed. Any residual anti-sigma factor in the forespore (which would otherwise interfere with sporulation) is inhibited by an anti-anti-sigma factor, which is encoded by spoIIAA. SpoIIAA is located near the locus for the sigma factor, so it is consistently expressed in the forespore. Since the spoIIAB locus is not located near the sigma F and spoIIAA loci, it is expressed only in the mother cell and therefore repress sporulation in that cell, allowing sporulation to continue in the forespore. Residual spoIIAA in the mother cell represses spoIIAB, but spoIIAB is constantly replaced so it continues to inhibit sporulation. When the full chromosome localizes to the forespore, spoIIAB can repress sigma F. Therefore, the genetic asymmetry of the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; chromosome and expression of sigma F, spoIIAB and spoIIAA dictate spore formation in &quot;B. subtilis.&quot; 

==Chromosomal replication==

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; is a model organism used to study bacterial chromosome replication. Replication of the single circular chromosome initiates at a single locus, the origin (&quot;oriC&quot;). Replication proceeds bidirectionally and two replication forks progress in clockwise and counterclockwise directions along the chromosome. Chromosome replication is completed when the forks reach the terminus region, which is positioned opposite to the origin on the chromosome map. The terminus region contains several short DNA sequences (&quot;Ter&quot; sites) that promote replication arrest. Specific proteins mediate all the steps in DNA replication. Comparison between the proteins involved in chromosomal DNA replication in &quot;B. subtilis&quot; and in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; reveals similarities and differences. Although the basic components promoting initiation, elongation, and termination of replication are well-conserved, some important differences can be found (such as one bacterium missing proteins essential in the other). These differences underline the diversity in the mechanisms and strategies that various bacterial species have adopted to carry out the duplication of their genomes.

==Genome==

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; has about 4,100 genes. Of these, only 192 were shown to be indispensable; another 79 were predicted to be essential, as well. A vast majority of essential genes were categorized in relatively few domains of cell metabolism, with about half involved in information processing, one-fifth involved in the synthesis of cell envelope and the determination of cell shape and division, and one-tenth related to cell energetics.

The complete genome sequence of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; sub-strain QB928 has 4,146,839 DNA base pairs and 4,292 genes. The QB928 strain is widely used in genetic studies due to the presence of various markers [aroI(aroK)906 purE1 dal(alrA)1 trpC2].

Several noncoding RNAs have been characterized in the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; genome in 2009, including Bsr RNAs.
Microarray-based comparative genomic analyses have revealed that &quot;B. subtilis&quot; members show considerable genomic diversity.

FsrA is a small RNA found in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. It is an effector of the iron sparing response, and acts to down-regulate iron-containing proteins in times of poor iron bioavailability.

A promising fish probiotic, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; strain WS1A, that possesses antimicrobial activity against &quot;Aeromonas veronii&quot; and suppressed motile &quot;Aeromonas&quot; septicemia in &quot;Labeo rohita&quot;. The de novo assembly resulted in an estimated chromosome size of 4,148,460 bp, with 4,288 open reading frames. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; strain WS1A genome contains many potential genes, such as those encoding proteins involved in the biosynthesis of riboflavin, vitamin B6, and amino acids (&quot;ilvD&quot;) and in carbon utilization (&quot;pta&quot;).

==Transformation==
Natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the surrounding medium. In &quot;B. subtilis&quot; the length of transferred DNA is greater than 1,271&quot; &quot;kb (more than 1&quot; &quot;million bases). The transferred DNA is likely double-stranded DNA and is often more than a third of the total chromosome length of 4,215&quot; &quot;kb. It appears that about 7–9% of the recipient cells take up an entire chromosome.

In order for a recipient bacterium to bind, take up exogenous DNA from another bacterium of the same species and recombine it into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state called competence.
Competence in &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is induced toward the end of logarithmic growth, especially under conditions of amino-acid limitation. Under these stressful conditions of semistarvation, cells typically have just one copy of their chromosome and likely have increased DNA damage. To test whether transformation is an adaptive function for &quot;B. subtilis&quot; to repair its DNA damage, experiments were conducted using UV light as the damaging agent. These experiments led to the conclusion that competence, with uptake of DNA, is specifically induced by DNA-damaging conditions, and that transformation functions as a process for recombinational repair of DNA damage.

While the natural competent state is common within laboratory &quot;B. subtilis&quot; and field isolates, some industrially relevant strains, e.g. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; (natto), are reluctant to DNA uptake due to the presence of restriction modification systems that degrade exogenous DNA. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; (natto) mutants, which are defective in a type I restriction modification system endonuclease, are able to act as recipients of conjugative plasmids in mating experiments, paving the way for further genetic engineering of this particular &quot;B. subtilis&quot; strain.

By adopting Green Chemistry in the use of less hazardous materials, while saving cost, researchers have been mimicking nature&#x27;s methods of synthesizing chemicals that can be useful for the food and drug industry, by &quot;piggybacking molecules on shorts strands of DNA&quot; before they are zipped together during their complementary base pairing between the two strands. Each strand will carry a particular molecule of interest that will undergo a specific chemical reaction simultaneously when the two corresponding strands of DNA pairs hold together like a zipper, allowing another molecule of interest, to react with one another in controlled and isolated reaction between those molecules being carried into these DNA complementary attachments. By using this method with certain bacteria that naturally follow a process replication in a multi-step fashion, the researchers can simultaneously carry on the interactions of these added molecules to interact with enzymes and other molecules used for a secondary reaction by treating it like a capsule, which is similar to how the bacteria performs its own DNA replication processes.

==Uses==

===20th century===

Cultures of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; were popular worldwide, before the introduction of antibiotics, as an immunostimulatory agent to aid treatment of gastrointestinal and urinary tract diseases. It was used throughout the 1950s as an alternative medicine, which upon digestion has been found to significantly stimulate broad-spectrum immune activity including activation of secretion of specific antibodies IgM, IgG and IgA and release of CpG dinucleotides inducing interferon IFN-α/IFNγ producing activity of leukocytes and cytokines important in the development of cytotoxicity towards tumor cells. It was marketed throughout America and Europe from 1946 as an immunostimulatory aid in the treatment of gut and urinary tract diseases such as Rotavirus and Shigellosis. In 1966, the U.S. Army dumped &quot;bacillus subtilis&quot; onto the grates of New York City subway stations for five days in order to observe how a biological agent dispensed around the subway trains would disperse and potentially affect unsuspecting passengers. Due to its ability to survive, it is thought to still be present there.

The antibiotic bacitracin was first isolated from a variety of &quot;Bacillus licheniformis&quot; named &quot;Tracy I&quot; in 1945, then considered part of the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; species. It is still commercially manufactured by growing the variety in a container of liquid growth medium. Over time, the bacteria synthesizes bacitracin and secretes the antibiotic into the medium. The bacitracin is then extracted from the medium using chemical processes.

Since the 1960s &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has had a history as a test species in spaceflight experimentation. Its endospores can survive up to 6 years in space if coated by dust particles protecting it from solar UV rays. It has been used as an extremophile survival indicator in outer space such as Exobiology Radiation Assembly, EXOSTACK, and EXPOSE orbital missions.

Wild-type natural isolates of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; are difficult to work with compared to laboratory strains that have undergone domestication processes of mutagenesis and selection. These strains often have improved capabilities of transformation (uptake and integration of environmental DNA), growth, and loss of abilities needed &quot;in the wild&quot;. And, while dozens of different strains fitting this description exist, the strain designated &#x27;168&#x27; is the most widely used. Strain 168 is a tryptophan auxotroph isolated after X-ray mutagenesis of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; Marburg strain and is widely used in research due to its high transformation efficiency.
&quot;Bacillus globigii&quot;, a closely related but phylogenetically distinct species now known as &quot;Bacillus atrophaeus&quot; was used as a biowarfare during Project SHAD (aka &quot;Project 112&quot;). Subsequent genomic analysis showed that the strains used in those studies were products of deliberate enrichment for strains that exhibited abnormally high rates of sporulation.

A strain of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; formerly known as &quot;Bacillus natto&quot; is used in the commercial production of the Japanese food &quot;nattō&quot;, as well as the similar Korean food &quot;cheonggukjang&quot;.

===21st century===
*As a model organism, &quot;B. subtilis&quot; is commonly used in laboratory studies directed at discovering the fundamental properties and characteristics of Gram-positive spore-forming bacteria. In particular, the basic principles and mechanisms underlying formation of the durable endospore have been deduced from studies of spore formation in &quot;B. subtilis&quot;.
* Its surface-binding properties play a role in safe radionuclide waste [e.g. thorium (IV) and plutonium (IV)] disposal.
* Due to its excellent fermentation properties, with high product yields (20 to 25 gram per litre) it is used to produce various enzymes, such as amylase and proteases.
*&quot;B. subtilis&quot; is used as a soil inoculant in horticulture and agriculture.
* It may provide some benefit to saffron growers by speeding corn growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.
* It is used as an &quot;indicator organism&quot; during gas sterilization procedures, to ensure a sterilization cycle has completed successfully. Specifically &quot;B. subtilis&quot; endospores are used to verify that a cycle has reached spore-destroying conditions.
* &quot;B. subtilis&quot; has been found to act as a useful bioproduct fungicide that prevents the growth of &quot;Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi&quot;, a.k.a. the mummy berry fungus, without interfering with pollination or fruit qualities.
*Both metabolically active and non-metabolically active &quot;B. subtilis&quot; cells have been shown to reduce gold (III) to gold (I) and gold (0) when oxygen is present. This biotic reduction plays a role in gold cycling in geological systems and could potentially be used to recover solid gold from said systems.

===Novel and artificial substrains===
* Novel strains of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; that could use 4-fluorotryptophan (4FTrp) but not canonical tryptophan (Trp) for propagation were isolated. As Trp is only coded by a single codon, there is evidence that Trp can be displaced by 4FTrp in the genetic code. The experiments showed that the canonical genetic code can be mutable.
* Recombinant strains pBE2C1 and pBE2C1AB were used in production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and malt waste can be used as their carbon source for lower-cost PHA production.
* It is used to produce hyaluronic acid, which is used in the joint-care sector in healthcare and cosmetics.
*Monsanto has isolated a gene from &quot;B. subtilis&quot; that expresses cold shock protein B and spliced it into their drought-tolerant corn hybrid MON 87460, which was approved for sale in the US in November 2011.
*A new strain has been modified to convert nectar into honey by secreting enzymes.

==Safety==

===In other animals===
&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; was reviewed by the US FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine and found to present no safety concerns when used in direct-fed microbial products, so the Association of American Feed Control Officials has listed it approved for use as an animal feed ingredient under Section 36.14 &quot;Direct-fed Microorganisms&quot;.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency Animal Health and Production Feed Section has classified &quot;Bacillus&quot; culture dehydrated approved feed ingredients as a silage additive under Schedule IV-Part 2-Class 8.6 and assigned the International Feed Ingredient number IFN 8-19-119.
On the other hand, several feed additives containing viable spores of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; have been positively evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority, regarding their safe use for weight gaining in animal production.

===In humans===
&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; spores can survive the extreme heat generated during cooking. Some &quot;B. subtilis&quot; strains are responsible for causing ropiness or rope spoilage – a sticky, stringy consistency caused by bacterial production of long-chain polysaccharides – in spoiled bread dough and baked goods. For a long time, bread ropiness was associated uniquely with &quot;B. subtilis&quot; species by biochemical tests. Molecular assays (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR assay, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, and sequencing of the V3 region of 16S ribosomal DNA) revealed greater &quot;Bacillus&quot; species variety in ropy breads, which all seems to have a positive amylase activity and high heat resistance.

&quot;B. subtilis&quot; CU1 (2 × 109 spores per day) was evaluated in a 16-week study (10 days administration of probiotic, followed by 18 days wash-out period per each month; repeated same procedure for total 4 months) to healthy subjects. &quot;B. subtilis&quot; CU1 was found to be safe and well tolerated in the subjects without any side effects.

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and substances derived from it have been evaluated by different authoritative bodies for their safe and beneficial use in food. In the United States, an opinion letter issued in the early 1960s by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated some substances derived from microorganisms as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), including carbohydrase and protease enzymes from &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. The opinions were predicated on the use of nonpathogenic and nontoxicogenic strains of the respective organisms and on the use of current good manufacturing practices. The FDA stated that the enzymes derived from the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; strain were in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, and that nontoxigenic and nonpathogenic strains of &quot;B. subtilis&quot; are widely available and have been safely used in a variety of food applications. This includes consumption of Japanese fermented soy bean, in the form of &quot;Natto&quot;, which is commonly consumed in Japan, and contains as many as 108 viable cells per gram. The fermented beans are recognized for their contribution to a healthy gut flora and vitamin K2 intake; during this long history of widespread use, &quot;natto&quot; has not been implicated in adverse events potentially attributable to the presence of &quot;B. subtilis&quot;. The natto product and the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; natto as its principal component are FOSHU (Foods for Specified Health Use) approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as effective for preservation of health.

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; has been granted &quot;Qualified Presumption of Safety&quot; status by the European Food Safety Authority.

<text>Guy of Anderlecht, also known as Saint Guy (or Guido, Guidon and Wye of Láken) (ca. 950–1012) was a Christian saint who is venerated in Catholic and Orthodox churches. He was known as the &quot;Poor Man of Anderlecht&quot;.

==Life and legend==
Born to poor parents, Guy lived a simple agricultural life until the age of fourteen, when he became assistant sacristan at the Sanctuary of Our Lady in Laeken, where his duties included sweeping the church, dressing the altars, taking care of the vestments and altar linens, ringing the bell for mass and vespers, and providing flowers and other decorations which were used in that church.

He shared his meager wages with the poor, and went to Brussels, having been persuaded by a merchant that he could earn more to give to the poor. Eventually, he became a trader on the river Senne. When the boat carrying the cargo he was responsible for sank, Guy believed he was being punished by God for being greedy and went on a pilgrimage, first to Rome as penance, and then to Jerusalem where he spent seven years visiting the holy places. On his return, he met in Rome, Wondulf, dean of the church of Anderlecht, and although not in robust health himself, agreed to guide the dean and his party on their pilgrimage to the Holy Land. During this second visit, Wondulf fell ill. He asked Guy to report his death in Anderlecht and gave him his gold ring to present as proof. Guy returned alone seriously ill. On 12 September 1012, he died in Anderlecht of dysentery.

==Veneration==
Saint Guy is the patron saint of Anderlecht, horned animals, bachelors, epileptics, labourers, protection of outbuildings, sheds and stables, sacristans, sextons, work horses; and is invoked against epilepsy, rabies, infantile convulsions, and mad dogs. In iconography, he is represented as a peasant praying with an angel ploughing a nearby field or as a pilgrim with a book or a hat, staff, rosary, and an ox at his feet.

Saint Guy&#x27;s grave was said to have been found when a horse kicked it. Cabdrivers of Brabant led an annual pilgrimage to Anderlecht until the beginning of World War I in 1914. They and their horses headed the procession followed by farmers, grooms, and stable boys, all leading their animals to be blessed. The village fair that ended the religious procession was celebrated by various games, music, and feasting, followed by a competition to ride the carthorses bareback. The winner entered the church on bareback to receive a hat made of roses from the parish pastor.

The Collegiate Church of St. Peter and St. Guido in Anderlecht, which contains a &quot;tomb&quot; considered to be that of Saint Guy in its crypt, is dedicated in his honour.

<text>De Tomaso Automobili Ltd. (previously known as De Tomaso Modena SpA) is an Italian car-manufacturing company. It was founded 1959 by Alejandro de Tomaso in Modena. It originally produced various sports prototypes and auto racing vehicles, including a Formula One car for Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1970. Most of the funding for the automaker came from Amory Haskell Jr.

In 1971 Ford Motor Company acquired an 84 percent stake in De Tomaso with Alejandro de Tomaso himself holding the balance. Ford sold back their stake in the automaker in 1974. The De Tomaso brand was acquired in 2014 by Hong Kong–based Ideal Team Ventures and in 2019 the newly formed company presented their first product, a retro-styled sports car called the De Tomaso P72.

== History ==

The company went on to develop and produce both sports cars and luxury vehicles, most notably the Ford-powered Italian-bodied Mangusta and Pantera. From 1976 to 1993, De Tomaso owned Italian sports car maker Maserati, and was responsible for producing cars including the Biturbo, the Kyalami, Quattroporte III, Karif and the Chrysler TC. De Tomaso also owned motorcycle company Moto Guzzi from 1973 to 1993.

De Tomaso went into liquidation in 2004, although production of new cars continued after this date. By 2008, a buyer was being sought for the De Tomaso factory and trademarks, per the court-appointed liquidators. In 2009, Gian Mario Rossignolo bought the De Tomaso trademark and founded a new company named &quot;De Tomaso Automobili SpA&quot;. Rossignolo planned to assemble chassis and bodies in one of Delphi Automotive&#x27;s old production facilities in Livorno and to fit bodywork, paint and finish its cars in the former Pininfarina factory in Grugliasco.

In May 2012 De Tomaso was again for sale after their business plan failed to gather sufficient financial backing. In July 2012, Rossignolo was arrested following allegations that he misused 7.5 million Euro worth of government funds. In September 2012, speculation emerged that BMW might be interested in the brand factory to produce new BMW models.

In 2014 the original workshop in Modena was in abandonment.

In April 2015 an Italian bankruptcy court approved the sale of the company to Hong Kong–based Consolidated Ideal Team Ventures, for . Per that sale report &quot;A lawyer for the buyer announced that Ideal Team Venture plans to produce cars in China bearing the De Tomaso name.&quot;

== De Tomaso sports cars ==

=== Vallelunga ===
De Tomaso&#x27;s first road-going production model was the Vallelunga (named after the racing circuit) introduced in 1963; a spider competition version was being raced a few months before the introduction. This mid-engine sports car had a 104 hp (78 kW) 4 cylinder engine shared with the Ford Cortina, and was able to attain a top speed of 215 km/h (134 mph). It had a fabricated steel backbone chassis, which was to become a common feature of De Tomaso cars. The aluminium coupé body was designed and several built by Fissore before production was moved to Ghia in 1965 where they were assembled with fibreglass bodies. In all, approximately 60 were produced.

=== Mangusta ===

The Mangusta, introduced in 1966 was the first De Tomaso produced in significant numbers. With the Mangusta, De Tomaso moved from European to American Ford engines. The car had a 4.7-litre iron-block V8 engine and steel and aluminium coupé bodywork from Ghia—an Italian coachbuilder also controlled by Alejandro de Tomaso. About 400 Mangustas were built before production ended in 1971.

=== Pantera ===
The Mangusta was succeeded by the Pantera. It appeared in 1971 with a 351 Cleveland Ford V8 and a low, wedge-shaped body designed by Ghia&#x27;s Tom Tjaarda. Through an agreement with Ford, De Tomaso sold Panteras in the USA through Ford&#x27;s Lincoln-Mercury dealers. Between 1971 and 1973, 6,128 Panteras were produced in Modena, the largest number of cars De Tomaso produced. The 1973 oil crisis and other factors compelled Ford to pull out of the Pantera deal at the end of 1973, a few months after buying all of De Tomaso&#x27;s shares and getting control of the entire production process in the three factories that shared the workload in northern Italy.

But De Tomaso retained from Ford the right to produce the car for the &quot;rest of the world&quot; market, so he continued Pantera production at a greatly reduced scale of fewer than 100 cars per year during the 1970s and 1980s. From then on, the cars were largely hand-built, even more than before.

Incorporating a Marcello Gandini facelift, suspension redesign, partial chassis redesign and a new, smaller Ford engine, the &quot;Pantera 90 Si&quot; model (the &quot;i&quot; standing for &quot;iniezione&quot;—Italian for &quot;fuel injection&quot;) was introduced in 1990. There were 41 &quot;90 Si&quot; models manufactured with 2 crash tested, 38 sold, and 1 example going directly into a museum before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical, carbon-fibre-bodied Guarà.

=== Guarà ===
The Guarà succeeded the Pantera and began production in 1993. The Guarà was designed by Carlo Gaino of Synthesis design, an Italian design house; Gaino also designed the Maserati Barchetta. Based on a Maserati competition car from 1991, using Ford and BMW parts in a composite body, the Guarà was available in coupé and barchetta versions. As with all De Tomasos except the Pantera, production was both limited and sporadic.

=== Biguà and off-road vehicles ===

In the early 2000s two other cars were planned by De Tomaso, but both proved abortive. A two-seat Gandini-styled convertible, the Biguà, was developed from a 1996 Geneva concept in partnership with Qvale, an American firm which had long imported European sports cars into the USA. But as production of the Biguà—renamed the Mangusta—began, the relationship between De Tomaso and Qvale soured; Qvale took over the car and rebadged it as the Qvale Mangusta. Production was short-lived, and Qvale&#x27;s Italian factory was bought in 2003 by MG Rover and the Mangusta&#x27;s mechanicals were then used as the basis of the MG XPower SV. In April 2002, De Tomaso began a project to build off-road vehicles in a new factory in Calabria in partnership with the Russian company UAZ, but this too floundered. The deal projected a production rate of 10,000 cars a year by 2006: however, no cars were built and De Tomaso went into voluntary liquidation in June 2004 after the death of Alejandro de Tomaso in 2003. The Guarà remained available in some markets in 2005 and 2006, but it appears that no cars were built after 2004.

=== P72 ===

The P72 is a retro-styled sports car introduced at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed under the newly reformed DeTomaso brand. Designed by Jowyn Wong, the car is a homage to the P70, a race car built by Carroll Shelby and styled by Peter Brock for De Tomaso, introduced in the late 1960s. The design of the car is meant to be hailing back to the LeMans race cars of the 1960s. The interior of the car is meant to have a modern outlook with opulent instrumentation. The chassis built to LMP1 standards is shared with the sister company Apollo Automobil&#x27;s Intensa Emozione.

== De Tomaso luxury cars ==
Although De Tomaso is principally known as a maker of high-performance sports cars, the firm also produced luxury coupés and saloons in tiny number throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

The 1971 Deauville was an effort to rival contemporary Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz saloons. With the same engine as the Pantera mounted in the front, the Deauville was clothed in an angular Tjaarda/Ghia four-door body. The Deauville did not compete with its rivals, especially those from Germany, on the perspective of build quality. Despite remaining on De Tomaso&#x27;s offerings until 1985, only 244 were ever made. A single example of an estate was built for Alejandro de Tomaso&#x27;s wife, the American racing driver Isabelle Haskell.

In 1972 De Tomaso introduced a coupé based on the Deauville with a slightly shortened Deauville chassis and the same Ford V8 engine, called the Longchamp. Its body design, however, was substantially different, and influenced by the Lancia Marica prototype, also designed by Tom Tjaarda. A total of 409 cars of all variations were built by the time the production ended in 1989.

== Maserati ==

With the assistance of the Italian government, De Tomaso took over Maserati in 1976 after its owner, Citroën, declared that it would no longer support the loss-making company. The first Maserati De Tomaso introduced, the Kyalami, was a Longchamp redesigned by Frua, with the Ford engine replaced by Maserati&#x27;s own 4.2-litre V8. The Kyalami remained in production until 1983, when it was superseded by the Biturbo, introduced two years earlier. Other cars Introduced under the De Tomaso ownership included the Quattroporte III/Royale and IV, the Barchetta, the Ghibli and the Shamal. All of the latter cars other than the Quattroporte III were based on the Biturbo while the Quattroporte was based on the Kyalami platform. De Tomaso introduced this concept of platform sharing to save development costs on new models. In 1993, De Tomaso sold Maserati to Fiat S.p.A. due to slumping sales and low profitability.

== Innocenti ==

In 1976 Innocenti passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name &quot;Nuova Innocenti&quot;.

From 1976 to 1987 the top of the range Innocenti was the Innocenti Mini de Tomaso, a sport version of the Innocenti Mini developed by De Tomaso, initially equipped with the BLMC 1275 cc engine, and from 1982 to 1987 with a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder turbocharged Daihatsu engine.

De Tomaso sold Innocenti to Fiat S.p.A. in 1993.

== Revival ==
=== 2009 acquisition ===

In 2009 the De Tomaso trademark was bought by Former Fiat executive Gian Mario Rossignolo who founded a new company named &quot;De Tomaso Automobili SpA&quot;. A new business plan for the company called for producing three models for a total of 8,000 vehicles: 3,000 crossovers, 3,000 limousines, and 2,000 two-seater sports cars.

==== 2011 De Tomaso Deauville ====

At the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, De Tomaso presented a new model. The new De Tomaso Deauville was to have been a five-door hatchback/crossover vehicle with all-wheel drive, which, in the details of its styling, quotes models from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

The proposed range included two gasoline engines with 300 PS and 500 PS as well as a diesel from VM Motori with 250 PS. The Deauville remained a prototype, as the new company never started production and the company chairman, Rossignolo, was arrested in 2012 on account of misappropriation of funds taken from the Italian government to revive the De Tomaso brand. As a result, 900 employees of the company were made redundant. Rossignolo was sentenced to five and a half years of imprisonment on the charges of fraud and embezzlement in 2018.

=== 2014 acquisition ===
The rights to the De Tomaso brand were acquired by Norman Choi of Ideal Team Ventures in 2014. The new management under Choi&#x27;s leadership undertook the task of reviving the brand. Five years later, the company unveiled its first product, the P72 retro-styled sports car at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, at the time of 60th anniversary of the De Tomaso brand. The car had been in development under the code name of &quot;Project P&quot;. The new car is based on the Apollo Intensa Emozione&#x27;s monocoque chassis, a car manufactured by De Tomaso&#x27;s sister company Apollo Automobil and 72 units of the car will be sold.

=== P900 ===
In November 2022 De Tomaso announced a track-only hypercar named the P900. The new vehicle will have a 6.2-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine designed to run on carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. De Tomaso only plans to produce 18 P900s and sell them for a starting price of . At the time of the announcement, the V12 engine was still in development and would not be fully ready until late 2024, leading De Tomaso to also offer a V10 engined option.

== Formula One ==
De Tomaso made a handful of Formula One appearances from 1961 to 1963, with their own chassis and a mix of engines. During 1962 the &quot;De Tomaso 801&quot; appeared, with an original 135-degree 1498 cc V8 with a claimed at 9500 rpm, and a six-speed De Tomaso transmission (although presumably developed by Valerio Colotti). The stubby and somewhat unaerodynamic design of the car raised some questions among period writers, as did the claimed max power. The De Tomaso 801 was entered in a number of races but only appeared at the 1962 Italian Grand Prix, where it failed to qualify.

De Tomaso then built a Formula One chassis (designed by Giampaolo Dallara) for Frank Williams Racing Cars to use in the 1970 Formula One season. The car was uncompetitive, failing to finish the first four races of the year. In the fifth, the Dutch Grand Prix, the De Tomaso 505/38 flipped and caught fire, killing driver Piers Courage. The team persevered, first with Brian Redman, then Tim Schenken. However, with no results, the partnership was dissolved at the end of the season.

<doc id="866396" wikidata="Q4660503" url="?curid=866396" title="A Voice from the Attic">
<text>A Voice from the Attic is a collection of Robertson Davies&#x27; essays about reading aimed at intelligent and thoughtful readers, whom he calls the &quot;clerisy&quot;. The title is a quote from Patrick Anderson and has a particular contemporary resonance in Davies&#x27; native Canada. Shannon King described this as a deprecatory phrase indicating &quot;a quaint rummage bin of colonial past&quot;.

==Editions==
&quot;A Voice from the Attic&quot; was initially published by the Canadian publisher McClelland and Stewart in 1960 with an accompanying edition published by Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. It has since been republished several times: Viking Press (1972), Rosetta Books (2019).

In the foreword to the 1990s edition, Davies wrote that while the essays were thirty-five to forty years old, they remained highly relevant. They run from musings on whether or not speed of reading and quality of reading are necessarily coincident, or even congruent, to essays on the nature of the popular book, to essays on the difference between the clerisy and the critic.

<text>The Nouveau Roman (, &quot;new novel&quot;) is a type of 1950s French novel that diverged from classical literary genres. Émile Henriot coined the term in an article in the popular French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; on May 22, 1957 to describe certain writers who experimented with style in each novel, creating an essentially new style each time. Most of the founding authors were published by Les Éditions de Minuit with the strong support of Jérôme Lindon.

==Overview==
Alain Robbe-Grillet, an influential theorist as well as writer of the Nouveau Roman, published a series of essays on the nature and future of the novel which were later collected in &quot;Pour un Nouveau Roman&quot;. Rejecting many of the established features of the novel to date, Robbe-Grillet regarded many earlier novelists as old-fashioned in their focus on plot, action, narrative, ideas, and character. Instead, he put forward a theory of the novel as focused on objects: the ideal &quot;nouveau roman&quot; would be an individual version and vision of things, subordinating plot and character to the details of the world rather than enlisting the world in their service.


A group of writers dubbed &quot;Nouveaux Romanciers&quot;, &quot;new novelists&quot;, appeared in the mid-1950s: Alain Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Nathalie Sarraute, Michel Butor and Robert Pinget. The style had different approaches but generally rejected the traditional use of chronology, plot and character in fiction, as well as the omniscient narrator. The &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; authors were open to influences from writers such as William Faulkner and the cinema. Both Robbe-Grillet and Marguerite Duras, whose 1958 novel &quot;Moderato cantabile&quot; was in the style of the &quot;Nouveau roman&quot;, also contributed to the French New Wave style of filmmaking.

Alain Robbe-Grillet became an elected member of the Académie française on 25 March 2004, succeeding Maurice Rheims at seat No. 32. Claude Simon, the 1985 Nobel laureate in Literature, is often identified with the &quot;nouveau roman&quot; movement.

The &quot;nouveau roman&quot; literary movement and the novels themselves were mainly theorized by Jean Ricardou, who, in addition to his well-known theoretical works – &quot;Problèmes du Nouveau Roman&quot; (1967), &quot;Pour une théorie du Nouveau Roman&quot; (1971), &quot;Le Nouveau Roman&quot; (1973), &quot;Nouveaux problèmes du roman&quot; (1978) – also published several &quot;nouveaux romans&quot; himself: &quot;L’Observatoire de Cannes&quot; (1961), &quot;La Prise de Constantinople&quot; (1965, Feneon prize for literature in 1966), &quot;Les Lieux-dits, petit guide d’un voyage dans le livre&quot; (1969). Besides his own writing, he organized, directed and published the acts of several conferences on the &quot;nouveau roman&quot;, including the famous 1971 conference and debate at Cerisy, published in two volumes: &quot;Nouveau roman : hier, aujourd’hui&quot;, indispensable for an understanding of the history of that important period of French literature. Just before his death in 2016, he was working on a book of interviews with Amir Biglari, in which he provides a complete, precise and objective account of the &quot;nouveau roman&quot; movement.

==Authors in the style of the &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot;==
The following is based on the list from &quot;Les nouveaux romanciers : etude critique&quot;.

=== Central figures in the 1950s ===
* Samuel Beckett
* Maurice Blanchot
* Michel Butor
* Jean Cayrol
* Marguerite Duras
* Louis-René des Forêts

* Georges Perec

* Jean Ricardou
* Philippe Sollers
* Monique Wittig

* Tony Duvert
* Jacques Godbout
* Maude Hutchins
* B. S. Johnson
==The &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; and the Left Bank==
The &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; style also left its mark on the screen as writers Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet became involved with the Left Bank film movement (often labelled as part of the French New Wave). Their collaboration with director Alain Resnais resulted in critical successes such as &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot; (1958) and &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (1961). They would later go on to direct their own films.
Influenced by these films French courses in North America during the 1960s and 1970s often included works by &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; authors such as Alain Robbe-Grillet&#x27;s &quot;La Jalousie&quot; (1957), Michel Butor&#x27;s &quot;La Modification&quot; (1957), Nathalie Sarraute&#x27;s &quot;Le Planetarium&quot; (1957) and Marguerite Duras&#x27; &quot;Moderato Cantabile&quot; (1958).

==The &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; in Quebec, Canada==
The &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; influenced French-language writers in Quebec such as Jacques Godbout and Gerard Bessette. The Canadian-born French writer Nancy Huston declared that she began writing in direct reaction to the stark style of the &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot; in &quot;Nord Perdu&quot; (1999). (See Joseph Pivato, nouveau roman)

<text>A Garron or Garran (from Scottish Gaelic &quot;gearran&quot;) is a type of a small sturdy horse or pony. The term occurs in Scotland and in Ireland, and generally refers to an undersized beast.

In Scotland, a Garron is one of the types of Highland pony. It is the larger, heavier type, bred on the mainland. The Isles&#x27; type of pony is generally smaller and slightly finer, but still within the standard of the Highland pony breed. There is less difference today than there once was between these two types.

The word &quot;Garron&quot; has also been used to describe a Highland cross of a Clydesdale horse with ponies. Such Garrons were used in farming, especially in the Highlands and Islands where a full-sized Clydesdale would not have been as economical. These horses were valued for their hardiness and ability to work on slopes.
Highland deer-stalking estates kept Garrons to bring the stags off the hill, as some still do, for tradition or where ATV access is not practicable.

==Mentions in literature==
Garrons are mentioned a number of times in George R. R. Martin&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. There, Garrons are used in cold mountainous areas, generally to the North near the Wall.

The word is used by R. S. Surtees in the first chapter of &quot;Jorrocks′ Jaunts and Jollities&quot;.

The author Nigel Tranter mentions Garrons frequently in his novels about Scottish history, for example &quot;Macbeth, the King&quot;.

In the Irish folktale &quot;The Tailor and the Three Beasts&quot;, the tailor meets a garron along the way who asks the tailor: &quot;Would you make me a hole ... where I could go a&#x27; hiding whenever the people are for bringing me to the mill or the kiln&quot;.

<text>Fort Point, known historically as the Castillo de San Joaquín (Spanish for &quot;Saint Joachim&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is a masonry seacoast fortification located on the southern side of the Golden Gate at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. It is also the geographic name of the promontory upon which the fort and the southern approach of the Golden Gate Bridge were constructed.

The fort was completed just before the American Civil War by the United States Army, to defend San Francisco Bay against hostile warships. The fort is now protected as Fort Point National Historic Site, a United States National Historic Site administered by the National Park Service as a unit of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It is now popular as a tourist viewing point of the Golden Gate Bridge directly over top of it.

==History==
In 1769 Spain occupied the San Francisco area and by 1776 had established the area&#x27;s first European settlement, with a mission and a presidio. To protect against encroachment by the British and Russians, Spain selected &quot;Punta del Cantil Blanco&quot;, a promontory with a high white cliff (&quot;cantil blanco&quot;) located at the narrowest part of the bay&#x27;s entrance, to construct a fortification. The &quot;Castillo de San Joaquín&quot; was constructed in 1794, subordinate to the nearby Presidio de San Francisco. It was an adobe structure housing nine to thirteen cannons.

Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, gaining control of the region and the fort, but in 1835 the Mexican army moved to Sonoma leaving the castillo&#x27;s adobe walls to crumble in the wind and rain. On July 1, 1846, after the Mexican–American War broke out between Mexico and the United States, U.S. forces, including Captain John Charles Fremont, Kit Carson and a band of 10 followers, captured and occupied the empty castillo and spiked (disabled) the cannons.

Sometime during the Spanish and Mexican eras, the &quot;Punta del Cantil Blanco&quot; came to be known as the &quot;Punta del Castillo&quot; (&quot;Castle Point&quot;), which was carried over into the era of U.S. sovereignty, in rough translation, as &quot;Fort Point&quot;.

===U.S. era===
Following the United States&#x27; victory in 1848, California was annexed by the U.S. and became a state in 1850. The gold rush of 1849 had caused rapid settlement of the area, which was recognized as commercially and strategically valuable to the United States. Military officials soon recommended a series of fortifications to secure San Francisco Bay. Coastal defenses were built at Alcatraz Island, Fort Mason, and Fort Point.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work on Fort Point in 1853. Plans specified that the lowest tier of artillery be as close as possible to water level so cannonballs could ricochet across the water&#x27;s surface to hit enemy ships at the water-line. Workers blasted the cliff down to above sea level. The structure featured seven-foot-thick walls and multi-tiered casemated construction typical of Third System forts. It was sited to defend the maximum amount of harbor area. While there were more than 30 such forts on the East Coast, Fort Point was the only one on the West Coast. In 1854 Inspector General Joseph K. Mansfield declared &quot;this point as the key to the whole Pacific Coast...and it should receive untiring exertions&quot;.

A crew of 200, many unemployed miners, labored for eight years on the fort. In 1861, with war looming, the army mounted the fort&#x27;s first cannon. Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Department of the Pacific, prepared Bay Area defenses and ordered in the first troops to the fort. Kentucky-born Johnston then resigned his commission to join the Confederate Army; he was killed at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862.

===Fort Point and the Civil War===
Throughout the Civil War, artillerymen at Fort Point stood guard for an enemy that never came. The Confederate raider CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; planned to attack San Francisco, but on the way to the harbor the captain learned that the war was over; it was August 1865, months after General Lee surrendered.

Severe damage to similar forts on the Atlantic Coast during the war – Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pulaski in Georgia – challenged the effectiveness of masonry walls against rifled artillery. Troops soon moved out of Fort Point, and it was never again continuously occupied by the army. The fort was nonetheless important enough to receive protection from the elements. In 1869 a granite seawall was completed. The following year, some of the fort&#x27;s cannon were moved to Battery East on the bluffs nearby, where they were more protected. In 1882 Fort Point was officially named Fort Winfield Scott after the hero of the war against Mexico. in 1886, it reverted back to its original Fort Point name with the establishment of a new fort within the Presidio of San Francisco that was then named Fort Winfield Scott.

===Into a new century===
In 1892, the army began constructing the new Endicott System concrete fortifications armed with steel, breech-loading rifled guns. Within eight years, all 103 of the smooth-bore cannons at Fort Point had been dismounted and sold for scrap. The fort, moderately damaged in the 1906 earthquake, where the fort was used as a temporary refugee camp by the U.S. Army, was used over the next four decades for barracks, training, and storage, however, in 1913, part of the interior wall was removed by the army in their short-lived attempt to make the fort the army detention barracks using soldier and prisoner labor. The detention barracks were later built on Alcatraz Island and was used until becoming a federal prison. Soldiers from the 6th U.S. Coast Artillery were stationed there during World War II to guard minefields and the anti-submarine net that spanned the Golden Gate.

New quarters and administrative buildings were constructed on the higher ground, behind the new Endicott batteries, moving Fort Scott to this location.

===Preserving Fort Point===
In 1926 the American Institute of Architects proposed preserving the fort for its outstanding military architecture. Funds were unavailable, and the ideas languished. Plans for the Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s called for the fort&#x27;s removal, but Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss redesigned the bridge to save &quot;While the old fort has no military value now,&quot; Strauss said, &quot;it remains nevertheless a fine example of the mason&#x27;s art... It should be preserved and restored as a national monument.&quot; The fort is situated directly below the southern approach to the bridge, underneath an arch that supports the roadway.

Preservation efforts were revived after World War II. On October 16, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed a bill creating Fort Point National 


===Landmark status===
Fort Point is designated as California Historical Landmark #82, officially listed under the site&#x27;s original name, Castillo De San Joaquín.

===Recreation===
The rocky point north of the fort produces waves, in the winter months, that are popular with surfers.

<text>In physics, particularly in quantum field theory, configurations of a physical system that satisfy classical equations of motion are called on the mass shell (on shell); while those that do not are called off the mass shell (off shell).

In quantum field theory, virtual particles are termed off shell because they do not satisfy the energy–momentum relation; real exchange particles do satisfy this relation and are termed on (mass) shell. In classical mechanics for instance, in the action formulation, extremal solutions to the variational principle are on shell and the Euler–Lagrange equations give the on-shell equations. Noether&#x27;s theorem regarding differentiable symmetries of physical action and conservation laws is another on-shell theorem.

==Mass shell==

Mass shell is a synonym for mass hyperboloid, meaning the hyperboloid in energy–momentum space describing the solutions to the equation:

:formula_1,

the mass–energy equivalence formula which gives the energy formula_2 in terms of the momentum formula_3 and the rest mass formula_4 of a particle. The equation for the mass shell is also often written in terms of the four-momentum; in Einstein notation with metric signature (+,−,−,−) and units where the speed of light formula_5, as formula_6. In the literature, one may also encounter formula_7 if the metric signature used is (−,+,+,+).

The four-momentum of an exchanged virtual particle formula_8 is formula_9, with mass formula_10. The four-momentum formula_9 of the virtual particle is the difference between the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles.

Virtual particles corresponding to internal propagators in a Feynman diagram are in general allowed to be off shell, but the amplitude for the process will diminish depending on how far off shell they are. This is because the formula_12-dependence of the propagator is determined by the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. The propagator typically has singularities on the mass shell.

When speaking of the propagator, negative values for formula_2 that satisfy the equation are thought of as being on shell, though the classical theory does not allow negative values for the energy of a particle. This is because the propagator incorporates into one expression the cases in which the particle carries energy in one direction, and in which its antiparticle carries energy in the other direction; negative and positive on-shell formula_2 then simply represent opposing flows of positive energy.

==Scalar field ==

An example comes from considering a scalar field in &quot;D&quot;-dimensional Minkowski space. Consider a Lagrangian density given by formula_15. The action is

:formula_16.

The Euler–Lagrange equation for this action can be found by varying the field and its derivative and setting the variation to zero, and is:

:formula_17

Now, consider an infinitesimal spacetime translation formula_18. The Lagrangian density formula_19 is a scalar, and so will infinitesimally transform as formula_20 under the infinitesimal transformation. On the other hand, by Taylor expansion, we have in general

:formula_21

Substituting for formula_22 and noting that formula_23 (since the variations are independent at each point in spacetime):

:formula_24

Since this has to hold for independent translations formula_25, we may &quot;divide&quot; by formula_26 and write:

:formula_27

This is an example of an equation that holds &quot;off shell&quot;, since it is true for any fields configuration regardless of whether it respects the equations of motion (in this case, the Euler–Lagrange equation given above). However, we can derive an &quot;on shell&quot; equation by simply substituting the Euler–Lagrange equation:

:formula_28

We can write this as:

:formula_29

And if we define the quantity in parentheses as formula_30, we have:

:formula_31

This is an instance of Noether&#x27;s theorem. Here, the conserved quantity is the stress–energy tensor, which is only conserved on shell, that is, if the equations of motion are satisfied.

<text>The Mad Hatter (Jervis Tetch) is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. He is modeled after the Hatter from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, a character often called the &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; in adaptations of Carroll. A scientist who invents and uses technological mind control devices to influence and manipulate the minds of his victims, the Mad Hatter is one of Batman&#x27;s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery.

The Mad Hatter has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. He has been voiced by Roddy McDowall in the DC animated universe and Peter MacNicol in the &quot;&quot; video game series, among others. He has also been portrayed in live-action by David Wayne in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series, and Benedict Samuel in the Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot;. A variation of the character named Liam Crandle appeared in the third season premiere of the Arrowverse series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, portrayed by Amitai Marmorstein.

==Publication history and characterization==
Created by Bill Finger and Lew Sayre Schwartz, the Mad Hatter made his first appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; #49 (October 1948). Jervis Tetch is fascinated with hats of all shapes and sizes, as well as the Lewis Carroll&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and its sequel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, particularly favoring the chapter &quot;A Mad Tea Party&quot;. According to Dr. Blakloch of Arkham Asylum:

Blakloch also notes that when agitated, Tetch begins rhyming as a defence mechanism. Tetch often quotes and makes reference to Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; novels, and sometimes even fails to discern between these stories and reality. In addition to his obsession with Lewis Carroll, Tetch has also shown an additional obsession with hats. In &quot;Secret Six&quot;, he will not eat a piece of food that does not have a hat on it, and states that he is not interested in the sight of his naked teammate Knockout because she is not wearing a hat. In the graphic novel &quot;Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&quot;, it is strongly implied that he is a pedophile, though the book itself is a symbolic dream in Batman&#x27;s mind, so this is dubious. His storylines in &quot;Streets of Gotham&quot; #4 and Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale&#x27;s &quot;&quot; also imply an unhealthy fixation on children, such as when he kidnaps a young Barbara Gordon and forces her into a tea party dressed as Alice, as well as kidnapping other runaway children and dressing them up like characters from &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Backstory===
Growing up, Tetch was a lonely, awkward child, shunned by other children and living in his own fantasy world. As an adult, he becomes a neuroscientist, and at some point moves into a boarding house owned by Ella Littleton. There he befriends Ella&#x27;s daughter, Connie, and her friends in her junior high school computer club, sometimes helping them with their projects. A few years later, when Connie is in high school, she gets pregnant. Fearing the reaction of her extremely strict mother, Connie lies to her and claims she had been raped by someone on her high school&#x27;s baseball team, the Gotham Hawks. Ella, in turn, approaches Tetch for help and convinces him that the Gotham Hawks are &quot;bad kids&quot;. Tetch agrees to use his mind control technology on a member of the team, making him use a pipe bomb to kill the other players. Although this is Tetch&#x27;s first known criminal act, his involvement in the locker room bombing would not be discovered until years later.

===Criminal career===
====Golden Age====

In his first appearance as the Mad Hatter, Tetch attempts to steal a trophy from the Gotham Yacht Club, and begins a crime spree that ends when he is foiled by Batman while he is trying to rob spectators from a high society horseshow. Tetch is subsequently sent to Arkham Asylum (although his fate is not revealed until &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #510). The Mad Hatter is not seen again in the Golden Age of Comic Books.

====Silver Age====
Beginning with &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #230 and then throughout the Silver Age of Comic Books, an impostor Mad Hatter appears and clashes with Batman many times. He is revealed as an impostor when the Mad Hatter finally reappears, claiming to have &quot;disposed of the impostor&quot; (although the impostor would return one last time in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #573 in 1987). Accompanied by several henchmen and a pet chimpanzee (named &quot;Carroll Lewis&quot;, although the Mad Hatter claims that the chimp refuses to tell him how it came to have that moniker), the Mad Hatter kidnaps Lucius Fox, the C.E.O. of Wayne Tech. Although he holds Lucius Fox for ransom, the Mad Hatter also unveils a device allowing him to copy the knowledge in Fox&#x27;s brain, which he intends to use to make an additional fortune. However, Lucius Fox is rescued by Batman, who also captures the Mad Hatter and his henchmen.

The Mad Hatter&#x27;s next appearance marks the first time he is portrayed in comics with the mind-controlling devices for which he would eventually become best known. Allying himself with other villains in an attempt to kill Batman, Hatter uses a mind-controlling hat on Scarecrow, forcing the villain (who had been paralyzed with fear) to fight. When Batman overcomes his attackers, Tetch flees and appears to die on a bridge under the wheels of a train. In actuality he had escaped by jumping onto a truck that had been passing underneath the bridge. Subsequent encounters with Batman resulted in Tetch being sent to Arkham.

During another early encounter with Batman, the Mad Hatter escapes from Arkham in time for Halloween, and makes his home in an old mansion that had been abandoned after a gruesome murder years before. Retreating deeply into his delusions about Wonderland, Tetch offers sanctuary to runaway children, asking them in return to dress up as characters from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and attend his tea parties, where he serves them drugged tea to keep them sedated. Around this time, the teenage Barbara Gordon comes to Gotham City, having been adopted by her uncle, Commissioner Jim Gordon, following the death of her parents. Barbara sneaks out against her uncle&#x27;s orders, and goes to Gotham Park, where she soon finds herself being chased by a group of masked men with knives. The group surround her, and begin implying that they will molest or rape her, provoking her to scream for help. The Mad Hatter appears and scares the men away with his gun. Tetch takes her to his &quot;Wonderland&quot;, where she is expected to play the role of Alice. When she refuses to drink tea and asks to leave, Tetch angrily smashes a teapot, scaring another of the runaways into sneaking away while Tetch&#x27;s attention is on Barbara. The boy leads the police and Batman to Tetch&#x27;s hideout, and Tetch is defeated by Batman while Commissioner Gordon rescues Barbara.

When Black Orchid visits Arkham Asylum, attempting to find out more about her past from Poison Ivy, she is assisted by Tetch. After Ivy refuses to help Orchid, Tetch tries to cheer her up. He also reveals he has been helping other inmates at Arkham, such as bringing Ivy things to make her plant-animal hybrids with. &quot;I believe in helping people,&quot; he explains. &quot;We were all put here for a purpose, I say. But it&#x27;s still nice to get a thank-you.&quot; Tetch is delighted to receive a small flower as thanks for his help. Tetch is also aware of Animal Man&#x27;s identity as Buddy Baker. He is seen laughing hysterically in Arkham with the final page of &quot;The Return with the Man of the Animal Powers&quot;, the second Animal Man story, after which he is dragged back to his cell.

In the &quot;&quot; saga, the Mad Hatter is the first to strike, following the breakout from Arkham. He invites all criminals to a tea party to which Batman and Robin would come. One of the criminals was Film Freak, on whom Tetch uses a mind control device, sending him to find the person that broke them out of Arkham. Batman and Robin come and defeat the Mad Hatter as Film Freak is defeated by Bane. In &quot;Robin: Year One&quot;, millionaire third-world dictator Generalissimo Lee hires the Mad Hatter to kidnap a number of young girls using his mind control devices. The Mad Hatter does so by implanting the devices in Walkmen, which he gives out to girls at Dick Grayson&#x27;s school. The young Robin manages to defeat the Mad Hatter, however.

Another plan consisted of implanting his devices in &quot;free coffee and donuts&quot; tickets he handed out in front of the police stations in Gotham. That plan had him controlling most of the cops in the city, inciting them to steal for him, and ultimately to riot. He even had Gotham police detectives Crispus Allen and Renee Montoya break into a bank for him. Sasha Bordeaux helped Batman stop him this time around. The Mad Hatter shows up in Gotham City after it is rocked by a devastating earthquake. He adds to his body count, callously murdering a policeman. His goal is to unearth a trove of valuables, which in the end turn out to be classic hats. Tetch&#x27;s role in the deaths of the Gotham Hawks High School Baseball team is eventually discovered by detectives in the Gotham City Police Department. Tetch, imprisoned at Arkham at the time, is interviewed to try to find his motive. After sending the police away, telling them that the team had been &quot;bad kids&quot; and that they &quot;deserved it&quot;, Tetch contacts Ella Littleton and warns her that the police might uncover her role in the bombing. Tetch had given her one of his mind-controlling hats years before, which she used to try to take control of a guard and try to help Tetch escape from Arkham. The Hatter is caught as he tries to escape, and the mind-controlled guard fires on police before dying in return fire. Tetch himself is shot multiple times and left in critical condition. Distraught at the news, Elle Littleton inadvertently tells her daughter Connie that Tetch had killed the team for her, to &quot;avenge her honor&quot;. Connie informs the police of everything that had happened, and Ella Littleton is arrested. While working with Black Mask, the Mad Hatter implants a mind control chip directly into Killer Croc&#x27;s brain, which causes him to mutate again due to the virus he had been injected with by Hush and the Riddler. Killer Croc embarks on a quest to get payback on those responsible for his mutation, and starts with the Mad Hatter. Batman arrives in time to save him, but Killer Croc escapes. During &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the Mad Hatter is first seen being roundly beaten by Argus, and then later fighting with the Secret Society of Super Villains during the Battle of Metropolis.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;/&quot;Secret Six&quot;===
During &quot;One Year Later&quot;, Tetch is revealed to have been involved in the plot by the Great White Shark to frame Harvey Dent for murdering various Gotham criminals in the &quot;Detective Comics&quot; storyline &quot;Face The Face&quot;. The capacity in which he is involved is left vague, however. Tetch&#x27;s base of operations in Gotham City is destroyed following a search for an atomic weapon, by the former Robin, Tim Drake, and the current Captain Boomerang, Owen Mercer. A recording of Tetch appears on a monitor screen and tells them that the roof will be the final hat they will ever wear as it falls down on them. Robin and Boomerang narrowly escape the building. He is later approached by Cat-Man, and he joins the members of the Secret Six to oppose the Secret Society of Super Villains; they have recruited him in hopes of a defense against Doctor Psycho&#x27;s mind control abilities. When Rag Doll attacks the Secret Six under Dr. Psycho&#x27;s control, Tetch puts on what he calls his &quot;thinking cap&quot; and goes into a seizure. After the Six crash-land, they are attacked by the Doom Patrol, who come close to apprehending the Six until Mad Hatter steps in and uses his mind control abilities to subdue the Doom Patrol singlehandedly, going so far as to almost make Elasti-Girl eat Beast Boy before Scandal stops him.

In a later issue of &quot;Secret Six&quot;, Tetch reveals that he has designed a hat to make him happy beyond the measures of what illegal drugs can. He also states that he has planted miniature listening devices around the House of Secrets to keep tabs on his fellow members. After revealing the true motives of Scandal Savage to leave the team, the Secret Six go after her, finding themselves at Vandal Savage&#x27;s temple in the mountains, where Doctor Psycho starts attacking the team. Tetch easily gets the upper hand on Doctor Psycho until Cheshire appears and stabs him in the back with a poisoned dagger. Scandal tends to Hatter&#x27;s wound, and Catman administers an antidote to Tetch. While the Six face off against Cheshire and Vandal Savage, Hatter takes on Doctor Psycho one on one, and emerges victorious despite his injuries, gravely injuring Dr. Psycho with Cheshire&#x27;s dagger. At the end of the miniseries, Hatter saves Scandal from falling to her death, and the Six befriend him. As Hatter stands atop Savage&#x27;s destroyed base with Rag Doll, he promises to be a very good friend in return. Rag Doll then pushes Hatter off the roof, seemingly to his death, saying there was &quot;only room for one dandy freak on the team&quot;. However, it is revealed on the final page that Tetch survived the fall. Heartbroken, he vows revenge on the rest of the Six. Prior to the events of &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, Tetch falls victim to his own mind control devices at the hands of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The two force him to &quot;lead&quot; a gang of Wonderland-related criminals called the Wonderland Gang through various gimmicky heists before Batman deduces the Tweeds to be the true masterminds. Once the three are returned to Arkham, the Hatter quickly exacts revenge on the two, manipulating them into a bloody brawl with his mind control chips.

===&quot;Gotham Underground&quot; and &quot;Salvation Run&quot;===
More recently, Mad Hatter appears in &quot;Gotham Underground&quot; #1 (August 2007), alongside Scarecrow, Hugo Strange, the Penguin, and Two-Face, who have gathered together to assist him in escaping Gotham in light of the disappearance of other villains due to the Suicide Squad and Amanda Waller kidnapping and deporting villains offworld in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;. During their meeting, however, the Suicide Squad break into the building and arrests them. He is later seen on the Hell World in &quot;Salvation Run&quot; #2 (January 2008), confirming that he has indeed been deported off-world. He appears briefly during the final issue as the Parademons attack, and escapes the Hell Planet alive thanks to Lex Luthor&#x27;s device.

===&quot;DC Infinite Halloween Special&quot;===
In the first issue of &quot;DC Infinite Halloween Special&quot;, Hatter recounts a first-person perspective story of a small boy whose parents are murdered before his eyes by a blood-sucking humanoid bat. The story follows closely the actual origin story of Batman and is a close approximation of the &quot;Red Rain&quot; &#x27;universe&#x27; (noted in the &quot;Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer&quot; series as Earth-43), wherein Batman is, in fact, a vampire.

===&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
In the 2008 DC storyline &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Dan Turpin has been approached by the Question with regards to a recent string of child disappearances related to a mysterious group called The Dark Side Club. Turpin subsequently discovers that the club is led by Darkseid, who has taken on a human form after the events of Death of the New Gods. He is gathering a group of children together and infusing them with the Anti-Life Equation as part of his broader plan to enslave and devastate the human race. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2 (2008), Turpin discovers that Tetch played an instrumental role in assisting Darkseid in gathering the children together through the use of his mind-control hats. Turpin, overcome with a violent rage that he himself does not understand, viciously beats Tetch. Upon threats of brain damage, Tetch confesses that the children have been taken to Blüdhaven. Confused and unsure of himself, Turpin then leaves and boards a bus to Blüdhaven. &quot;Final Crisis Secret Files and Origins&quot; #1 also reveals that Darkseid&#x27;s Justifiers helmets are a combination of Apokoliptic technology and the Hatter&#x27;s mind control circuitry.

===&quot;Secret Six&quot; redux===
&quot;Secret Six&quot; #6 (February 2009) reveals that Mad Hatter has hired the Six to break Tarantula out of Alcatraz, to deliver her as well as a &quot;Get Out of Hell Free&quot; card created by Neron to Gotham City. Doing so has put the Six directly in the line of retribution from Junior, Ragdoll&#x27;s psychotic sister. Junior believes that the Neron card is key to saving her soul from eternal damnation, and will stop at nothing to reclaim it from Tarantula and the Six. It seems that Junior&#x27;s wrath is not the motivation behind Tetch&#x27;s hiring the Six to perform this mission. He has made it clear his intention is to ensure the Six safely reach Gotham. The story is ongoing, and Tetch&#x27;s full plan has yet to be revealed, although it is made clear in the same issue that Tetch intends to murder each member of the Six as part of his revenge. Tetch observes as the Six battle Junior and his goons on Gotham Bridge and when the battle ceases he confronts them, telling them how they betrayed him. Rag Doll throws Tetch&#x27;s hat over the edge and Tetch jumps off after it.

===&quot;Batman: Life After Death&quot;===
Tetch next shows up, seemingly uninjured from his battle with the Secret Six, working with the Penguin, who is planning on killing the new Black Mask. He assists the Penguin in attaching a mind control device to a gas mask, which is placed on Batman&#x27;s head to turn him into a puppet to assassinate Black Mask. The plot fails, and Batman recovers before killing Black Mask. Following this, Tetch is shown once again incarcerated in Arkham. He hires Deathstroke and the Titans to free him, and escapes just prior to a massive prison riot.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Jervis Tetch is portrayed as suffering from hypogonadism, which prevents him from physically maturing. He begins taking testosterone-enhancing drugs that permanently impair his mental stability. His parents commit him to Arkham Asylum after he has a drug-induced psychotic breakdown, during which he begins referring to himself as &quot;the Mad Hatter&quot;. He is eventually freed by the White Rabbit. He uses his mind control technology to make a passenger train full of people commit suicide, assisted by his henchmen, the Tweed Brothers. He then uses his technology to drive several Gothamites insane. Batman eventually foils his plan and throws him through a glass rooftop.

Mad Hatter and the Tweed Brothers next appear after Black Mask escapes Arkham Asylum. When Black Mask attempts to regain control over his False Face Society, he comes into conflict with the Mad Hatter, who sees Black Mask as a rival due to Black Mask&#x27;s similar mind control abilities. Both the Mad Hatter and Black Mask engage in battle, only for Batman to intervene and subdue them both.

The Mad Hatter resurfaces, selling his mind control hats all over Gotham and holding casting calls at his missile launch facility base, all to recreate a “perfect day” he had years before at a theme park with his childhood sweetheart, Alice. He creates a replica of the theme park in his base and brainwashes the wearers of his hats to attend as &quot;guests&quot;. Tetch then goes to Alice&#x27;s house, only to find that she is now a drug addict and alcoholic; in anger, he beats her to death. He attempts to cast a new Alice with “mind controlled girls”, but ultimately kills them for falling short of his ideal. In frustration, he makes his mind control subjects walk into the sewer and drown themselves.

The Mad Hatter becomes obsessed with Bruce Wayne&#x27;s new girlfriend, Natalya Trusevich, and has the Tweed Brothers kidnap her. She spurns the Mad Hatter&#x27;s advances, but he realizes she knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity and torture her for the information. In the end, she refuses to give the information, and he throws her out of a helicopter to her death. An enraged Batman hunts him down and nearly drowns him, only to revive him at the last minute when his conscience gets the better of him.

===DC Rebirth===
In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Mad Hatter is among the villains.

==Characterization==
===Skills and abilities===
While the Mad Hatter has no inherent superpowers, he is a brilliant &#x27;neurotechnician&#x27; with considerable knowledge on how to dominate and control the human mind, either through hypnosis or direct technological means. Usually, the Hatter places his mind control devices in the brims of hats, but has been known to utilize other devices as well. More recently, he has been able to directly influence the minds of others at a distance without any apparent equipment. However, this is most likely not a newly emerging superhuman ability; more likely, his skill at miniaturizing and concealing technology, and advances upon his original technology, have probably allowed him to develop technology that permits him to use a device hidden upon his person (such as in his hat) to project mind controlling powers in the manner of a meta-human ability such as telepathic powers.

The Mad Hatter is not above using his own inventions on himself, such as creating a hat that can cause him both extreme bliss, as well as return him to lucidity when he deems it necessary. Despite his small stature, the Mad Hatter has been known to exhibit surprising strength and agility from time to time. In the graphic novel &quot;Madness&quot;, the Mad Hatter is shown as impressively holding his own in a fistfight with Batman atop a moving train.

===Appearance===
The Mad Hatter has gone through many changes in his physical appearance over the years, but the basic look remains the same. In his debut, he was a very short brown (or auburn) haired man. When he reappeared in the early 1980s, he was depicted as of average height, with blonde hair. In later years, he was short again but with white hair. Today, Tetch has red hair much like his impostor did, but his size and height still seem to vary. Constants throughout his depictions are a slightly overlarge head and (more recently) very large teeth. In &quot;Secret Six&quot; #6 (December 2006), Tetch claims to suffer from macrocephaly.

==Other characters named Mad Hatter==
After the real Jervis Tetch/Mad Hatter had been sent to Arkham Asylum following his debut, a very different Mad Hatter appeared, who claimed to be Jervis Tetch. This Mad Hatter first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #230 (April 1956) by Bill Finger, and Sheldon Moldoff, and, unlike the original, was tall, red-headed, stocky and sported a gaudy mustache. He was primarily a thief who was obsessed with completing his private collection of hats from all nations, cultures, and historical periods. He often constructed various weaponry concealed inside his hats like flamethrowers and buzzsaws.
The headgear he wanted most was, of course, Batman&#x27;s cowl. In numerous attempts, he tried to de-cowl Batman. After many tries, he was successful by spraying the cowl with a radioactive substance. Batman then went to nuclear lab and as he was preparing to leave, he set off the radiation detectors. He then had to remove it and handed it to one of Mad Hatter&#x27;s henchmen who was disguised as one of the lab workers. No sooner did the Mad Hatter put it in his collection than Batman and Robin arrived. They had traced the cowl with their &quot;super sensitive Geiger counter&quot; in the Batplane.
Later on, in &quot;Batman&quot; #297 (March 1978), the impostor Mad Hatter claimed to have gone straight, but that turned out to be a lie. In 1981, it was revealed that he was in fact an impostor when the real Jervis Tetch returned. The real Hatter claimed to have killed his impostor, but the impostor Mad Hatter reappeared alive in 1987 in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #573, where he ended up being beaten by Batman. He was treated to a cameo appearance in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #44 (1989) where he is seen in his cell at Arkham making paper hats in the story &quot;His Name is Clayface III&quot;. Upon seeing him, one Arkham guard tells another: &quot;He could murder ya a thousand different ways if we let &#x27;im have any real hat--! But that doesn&#x27;t stop him from tryin&#x27;!&quot; The impostor Mad Hatter appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #700 (2010) under the moniker the &quot;Hatman&quot;, as well as in a flashback to his Mad Hatter days.

Agoos (nicknamed &quot;Goose&quot;) was born in Geneva, Switzerland, as his father was working overseas there for Caterpillar Construction Company. He grew up in Texas, and attended J.J. Pearce High School in Richardson, Texas. He was named a two-time &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; High School All-American as well as a Dallas All-Sports Athlete-of-the-Year. Agoos is Jewish, and during the summer of 1985, represented the United States at the 1985 Maccabiah Games and was at 17 the youngest player on the team.

==Youth career==
From 1986 to 1990, Agoos played soccer for Bruce Arena at the University of Virginia. During his four seasons with the Cavaliers, earned First-Team All-American honors twice, in 1988 and 1990 and is the only 4-time All American in Uva&#x27;s history. He finished second in Hermann Award voting his senior season.

In 1989, his junior year, Virginia went to the NCAA championship game where it fought the Santa Clara University to a 1–1 draw after 4 overtimes. While the teams wanted to continue to play, NCAA officials ended the game and declared the two teams co-champions. At the time there were no penalty kicks to end a tie. At the end of the season, Agoos represented the United States at the 1989 Maccabiah Games.

==Club career==
Upon graduating from college, Agoos played for the Maryland Bays of the A-League in 1991. On February 13, 1991, the Dallas Sidekicks of the Major Indoor Soccer League drafted Agoos with the second overall pick of the 1991 draft. He played in thirty games in the 1991–1992 season, scoring seven goals. In 1992, he left the Sidekicks to play full-time for the U.S. national team, but Dallas again selected him in a draft, this time the 1993 Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL) draft, but he did not re-sign with the team. On June 26, 1994, after being cut from the U.S. roster for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Agoos signed with the Los Angeles Salsa for the 1994 American Professional Soccer League season. The Salsa went to the playoff semifinals that season as Agoos was selected Second Team All League. In the fall of 1994, he moved to Germany, where he played for SV Wehen during the 1994–95 season.

===Major League Soccer===
Agoos returned from Germany in 1995 to sign with Major League Soccer. While waiting for the new league&#x27;s first season, Agoos served as an assistant coach to Bruce Arena at the University of Virginia. In order to create a league, MLS allocated various recognized players to each team. As part of this process, the league allocated Agoos to D.C. United where he joined Bruce Arena, the team&#x27;s first coach. That year, Agoos won the first MLS Championship as well as the U.S. Open Cup. He followed it up the next year with his second MLS Championship. In 1998, D.C. United achieved its greatest accomplishment when it defeated Vasco de Gama to take the Interamerican Cup. Agoos then won his third MLS Championship with D.C. United in 1999. He spent 2001 through 2004 with the San Jose Earthquakes, and proceeded to win his fourth and fifth MLS Championships. Agoos was named MLS Defender of the Year in 2001 and earned a place in the MLS Best XI three times (1997, 1999, and 2001). In 2005, Agoos was named to the league&#x27;s tenth anniversary All-Time Best XI. He was traded to the MetroStars after the 2004 season for a fourth-round draft pick. In ten years in MLS, Agoos scored 11 regular-season goals and added 25 assists in 244 matches. In 2005, he was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI, before retiring December 8, 2005.

==International career==
Agoos represented Team USA at the 1985 Maccabiah Games in Israel. At 17 years of age, he was the youngest player on the team.

Agoos made his debut with the United States national team on January 10, 1988, against Guatemala. His first national team goal came just three days later on January 13, 1988, also against Guatemala. He was the last member to be cut from the U.S. squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup and he burned his uniform upon hearing the news. He made the squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France but did not play a single minute, in favor of David Regis. In the World Cup in South Korea/Japan at the age of 34, Agoos started the first three games (he scored an own goal to finish the scoring in the surprising win against Portugal) until he suffered a calf injury against Poland. He later missed the rest of the tournament. He was capped a total of 134 times for the U.S. Agoos earned his last cap against Wales on May 26, 2003.

Agoos was also a member of the 1992 Team USA Futsal team which won a silver medal at Hong Kong. He earned ten caps and scored two goals with the futsal team.

==Post-playing career==
Agoos was named as New York Red Bulls&#x27; Technical Director on September 28, 2006, serving under head coach Bruce Arena. He officially joined the Bulls organization on January 1, 2007. On January 7, 2008, he was promoted to Sporting Director.

In 2009 Agoos was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

On March 28, 2011, Agoos was hired by MLS as their Technical Director of Competition. He will work on planning and competition strategies.

In January 2025, Agoos was announced as the President of Soccer Operations and General Manager of Portland Thorns FC, a team in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League.

<text>The System/23 Datamaster (Model 5322 desktop model and Model 5324 floor model) is an 8-bit microcomputer developed by IBM. Released in July 1981, the Datamaster was the least expensive IBM computer until the far less expensive and far more popular IBM PC was announced in the following month.

==Description==

The Datamaster is an all-in-one computer with text-mode CRT display, keyboard, processor, memory, and two 8-inch floppy disk drives in one cabinet. The processor is an 8-bit Intel 8085 running at 6.14 MHz, with bank switching to manage 128 KB of memory. Available RAM was 32 KB (expandable to 128 KB), and the machine had four internal expansion slots. It could display 80 × 24 characters of text (each character with 10 × 14 pixels) with 256 possible characters, similar to the IBM PC&#x27;s Code page 437, on a built-in 12&quot; green phosphor CRT.

The intention of the Datamaster was to provide a computer that could be installed and operated without specialists. A BASIC interpreter was built-in to the system. IBM decided to merge the Datamaster&#x27;s BASIC implementation with System/34 BASIC, which reportedly delayed the Datamaster by almost a year. When introduced, a single-screen Datamaster sold for around . A second keyboard and screen could be attached in an extended configuration.

==Influence on later IBM systems==
The familiarity the design group gained on the Datamaster project encouraged selection of an Intel CPU for the IBM PC. The delay caused by the decision to reuse System/34 BASIC in the Datamaster was one of the factors in IBM&#x27;s selection of Microsoft BASIC for the PC (the other being the popularity of Microsoft BASIC on home computers at the time).

A number of hardware components from the Datamaster were reused in the later IBM PC. The PC&#x27;s expansion bus, later known as the ISA bus, was based on the Datamaster&#x27;s I/O bus. The Datamaster&#x27;s Model F keyboard with its 5251-style key arrangement was also reused in the PC, albeit with a serial interface (instead of the parallel one used on the Datamaster) and a new external housing.

The main coalition partners were Prussia and Russia with Saxony, Sweden, and Great Britain also contributing. Excluding Prussia, some members of the coalition had previously been fighting France as part of the Third Coalition, and there was no intervening period of general peace. On 9 October 1806, Prussia declared war on France and joined a renewed coalition, fearing the rise in French power after the defeat of Austria and establishment of the French-sponsored Confederation of the Rhine in addition to having learned of French plans to cede Prussian-desired Hanover to Britain in exchange for peace. Prussia and Russia mobilized for a fresh campaign with France, massing troops in Saxony.

Napoleon decisively defeated the Prussians in an expeditious campaign that culminated at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. French forces under Napoleon occupied Prussia, pursued the remnants of the shattered Prussian Army, and captured Berlin. They then advanced all the way to East Prussia, Poland and the Russian frontier, where they fought an inconclusive battle against the Russians at the Battle of Eylau on 7–8 February 1807. Napoleon&#x27;s advance on the Russian frontier was briefly checked during the spring as he revitalized his army with fresh supplies. Russian forces were finally crushed by the French at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807, and three days later Russia asked for a truce.

Through the Treaties of Tilsit in July 1807, France made peace with Russia, which agreed to join the Continental System. The treaty was particularly harsh on Prussia, however, as Napoleon demanded much of the Prussian territory along the lower Rhine west of the Elbe and in what was part of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Respectively, these acquisitions were incorporated into the new Kingdom of Westphalia, led by his brother Jérôme Bonaparte and into the new Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish client state, ruled by his new ally the king of Saxony. At the end of the war, there was peace on Continental Europe with Napoleon as master of almost all of western and central continental Europe, except for Spain, Portugal, Austria and several other smaller states.

Despite the end of the Fourth Coalition, Britain remained at war with France. War would return to Continental Europe later in 1807, when Napoleon decided to invade Portugal in order to compel Portugal to join the Continental System. A joint Franco-Spanish force invaded Britain&#x27;s ally Portugal, beginning the Peninsular War where Napoleon would also invade Spain as well. A further Fifth Coalition would be assembled when Austria re-joined the conflict in 1809.

==Origins==
The Fourth Coalition (1806–1807) of Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden formed against France within months of the collapse of the previous coalition. Following his triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz and the subsequent demise of the Third Coalition, Napoleon looked forward to achieving a general peace in Europe, especially with his two main remaining antagonists, Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, he sought to isolate Prussia from the influence of these two powers by offering a tentative alliance, while also seeking to curb Prussia&#x27;s political and military influence among the German states.

Despite the death of William Pitt in January 1806, Britain and the new Whig administration remained committed to checking the growing power of France. Peace overtures between the two nations early in the new year proved ineffectual due to the still unresolved issues that had led to the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens. One point of contention was the fate of Hanover, a German state in personal union with the British monarchy that had been occupied by France since 1803. Dispute over this state would eventually become a &quot;casus belli&quot; for both Britain and Prussia against France. This issue also dragged Sweden into the war, whose forces had been deployed there as part of the effort to liberate Hanover during the war of the previous coalition. The path to war seemed inevitable after French forces ejected the Swedish troops in April 1806.

Apart from some naval clashes and the peripheral Battle of Maida in southern Italy in July 1806 (though these actions are considered part of the tail end of the War of the Third Coalition), the main conflicts between Britain and France during the Fourth Coalition would involve no direct general military confrontation. Rather, there was an escalation in the ongoing economic warfare between the two powers. With Britain still retaining its dominance of the seas, Napoleon looked to break this dominance (after his defeat of Prussia) with his issuance of the Berlin Decree and the beginnings of his Continental System. Britain retaliated with its Orders in Council several months later.

In the meantime, Russia spent most of 1806 recovering from defeats from the previous year&#x27;s campaign. Napoleon had hoped to establish peace with Russia and a tentative peace treaty was signed in July 1806, but this was vetoed by Tsar Alexander I and the two powers remained at war. Though nominally an ally in the coalition, Russia remained a dormant entity for much of the year (giving virtually no military aid to Prussia in the main battles that October, as Russian armies were still mobilising). Russian forces would not fully come into play in the war until late 1806 when Napoleon entered Poland.

Finally, Prussia had remained at peace with France the previous year, though it did come close to joining the Allies in the Third Coalition. A French corps led by Marshal Bernadotte had illegally violated the neutrality of Ansbach in Prussian territory on their march to face the Austrians and Russians. Anger by Prussia at this trespass was quickly tempered by the results of Austerlitz, and a convention of continued peace with France was signed two weeks after that battle at Schönbrunn. This convention was modified in a formal treaty two months later, with one clause in effect promising to give Hanover to Prussia in exchange for Ansbach&#x27;s being awarded to France&#x27;s ally Bavaria. In addition, on 15 March 1806 Napoleon elevated his brother-in-law Marshal Joachim Murat to become ruler of the Grand Duchy of Berg and Duchy of Cleves (acquired from Bavaria in return for its receiving Ansbach). Murat exacerbated Prussian enmity by tactlessly ejecting a Prussian garrison that was stationed in his newly acquired realm, prompting a stern rebuke from Napoleon. Relations between France and Prussia quickly soured when Prussia eventually discovered that Napoleon had secretly promised to return sovereignty of Hanover back to Britain during his abortive peace negotiations with the British. This duplicity by the French would be one of the main causes for Prussia declaring war that autumn.

Another cause was Napoleon&#x27;s formation in July 1806 of the Confederation of the Rhine out of the various German states which constituted the Rhineland and other parts of western Germany. A virtual satellite of the French Empire with Napoleon as its &quot;Protector&quot;, the Confederation was intended to act as a buffer state from any future aggressions from Austria, Russia or Prussia against France (a policy that was an heir of the French revolutionary doctrine of maintaining France&#x27;s &quot;natural frontiers&quot;). The formation of the Confederation was the final nail in the coffin of the moribund Holy Roman Empire and subsequently its last Habsburg emperor, Francis II, formally abolished the empire. Napoleon consolidated the various smaller states of the former Holy Roman Empire which had allied with France into larger electorates, duchies and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian and Austrian Germany more efficient. He also elevated the electors of the two largest Confederation states, his allies Württemberg and Bavaria, to the status of kings.

The Confederation was above all a military alliance: in return for continued French protection, member states were compelled to supply France with large numbers of their own military personnel (mainly to serve as auxiliaries to the ), as well as contribute much of the resources needed to support the French armies still occupying western and southern Germany. Prussia was indignant at this increasing French meddling in the affairs of Germany (without its involvement or even consultation) and viewed it as a threat. Napoleon had previously attempted to ameliorate Prussian anxieties by assuring Prussia he was not averse to its heading a North German Confederation, but his duplicity regarding Hanover dashed this. A final spark leading to war was the summary arrest and execution of German nationalist Johann Philipp Palm in August 1806 for publishing a pamphlet which strongly attacked Napoleon and the conduct of his army occupying Germany. After giving Napoleon an ultimatum on 1 October 1806, Prussia (supported by Saxony) finally decided to contend militarily with the French Emperor.

==Prussian campaign==
In August 1806, the Prussian king Frederick William III made the decision to go to war independently of any other great power, save the distant Russia, influenced by his wife Queen Louise and the war party in Berlin. Another course of action might have involved openly declaring war the previous year and joining Austria and Russia in the Third Coalition. In fact, the Tsar had visited the Prussian king and queen at the tomb of Frederick the Great in Potsdam that very autumn, and the monarchs secretly swore to make common cause against Napoleon. Had Prussian forces been engaged against the French in 1805, this might have contained Napoleon and prevented the eventual Allied disaster at Austerlitz. In any event, Prussia vacillated in the face of the swift French invasion of Austria and then hastily professed neutrality once the Third Coalition was crushed. When Prussia did declare war against France in 1806, its main ally the Russians still remained far away remobilising. The Electorate of Saxony would be Prussia&#x27;s sole German ally. Napoleon could scarcely believe Prussia would be so foolish to take him on in a straight fight with hardly any allies at hand on its side, especially since most of his was still in the heart of Germany close to the Prussian border. He drummed up support from his soldiers by declaring that Prussia&#x27;s bellicose actions had delayed their phased withdrawal back home to France to enjoy praise for the previous year&#x27;s victories.

The initial military manoeuvres began in September 1806. In a letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase &quot;le bataillon-carré&quot; (&quot;square battalion&quot;). In the &quot;bataillon-carré&quot; system, the various corps of the would march uniformly together in close supporting distance. If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon unleashed all French forces east of the Rhine, deploying the corps of the along the frontier of southern Saxony. In a preemptive strike to catch the Prussians unaware, the Emperor had the march as a massive (battalion square) in three parallel columns through the Franconian Forest in southern Thuringia. Each corps would be in mutual supporting distance of each other, both within the column and laterally to the other columns (once through the difficult passage of the forest), thus allowing the to meet the enemy at any contingency. This strategy was adopted due to Napoleon&#x27;s lack of intelligence regarding the Prussian main army&#x27;s whereabouts and uncertainty over his enemy&#x27;s puzzling manoeuvres in their march to face him. The reason for this stemmed mainly from the mutual mistrust within the Prussian high command that had resulted in division among the Prussian commanders over which plan of action for the war would be adopted. Despite the deficiency in pinpointing the main Prussian army&#x27;s exact position, Napoleon correctly surmised their probable concentration in the vicinity of Erfurt-Weimar and formulated a general plan of a thrust down the Saale valley towards Gera and Leipzig, then wheeling westward in order to envelop the left flank of where he believed the Prussians were located and thus cut off their communications and line of retreat to Berlin.
On 8 October 1806, after a cavalry skirmish at Saalburg, a Prussian division was brushed aside in the Battle of Schleiz on 9 October. The following day, Marshal Lannes, debouching from the passage of the forest, crushed a Prussian division at Battle of Saalfeld, where the popular Prince Louis Ferdinand was killed.

At the double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October, Napoleon smashed a Prussian army led by Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen and Ernst von Rüchel at Jena, while his Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout routed Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick&#x27;s main army at Auerstedt. At Jena, Napoleon fought only a contingent of the Prussian army. At Auerstedt a single French corps defeated the bulk of the Prussian army, despite being heavily outnumbered. Victory at Auerstedt was all but secured once the Duke of Brunswick (as well as fellow commander Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau) were mortally wounded, and the Prussian command devolved to the less able King Fredrick William who believed he was facing Napoleon himself. Matters worsened once the vanquished remnants of the Prussian army from Jena stumbled onto the clash at Auerstedt, further plunging the Prussians&#x27; morale and triggering their precipitous retreat. For this conspicuous victory, Marshal Davout was later created the &quot;Duke of Auerstedt&quot; by Napoleon.

During the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte had marched from Naumburg to Dornburg and arrived at Apolda late in the day due to the poor state of the roads. Apolda sits on strategically important heights between Auerstedt to the North and Jena to the South, and Napoleon had ordered Bernadotte to move to Dornburg and seize Apolda; upon establishing his artillery on the heights, Bernadotte compelled the Prussians to withdraw from Jena and Auerstedt. Napoleon, believing Bernadotte to be a coward due to his absence in either battle, nearly court-martialed him. On 17 October, Bernadotte mauled Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of Württemberg&#x27;s previously untouched Reserve corps at the Battle of Halle and chased it across the Elbe river, this redeeming himself in Napoleon&#x27;s eyes.
Some 160,000 French soldiers fought against Prussia increasing in number as the campaign went on, with reinforcements arriving across the Wesel bridgehead from the peripheral theatre surrounding the recently formed Kingdom of Holland, advancing with such speed that Napoleon was able to destroy as an effective military force the entire quarter of a million-strong Prussian army. The Prussians sustained 65,000 casualties including the deaths of two members of the royal family lost a further 150,000 prisoners, over 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets stockpiled in Berlin. The French suffered around 15,000 casualties for the whole campaign. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806 and visited the tomb of Frederick the Great, telling his marshals to show their respect, saying, &quot;If he were alive we wouldn&#x27;t be here today&quot;.

In total, Napoleon and the had taken only 19 days from the commencement of the invasion of Prussia until essentially knocking it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerstedt. Most of the shattered remnants of the Prussian army and the displaced royal family escaped to refuge in East Prussia near Königsberg, eventually to link up with the approaching Russians and continue the fight. Meanwhile, on 11 December 1806 the Treaty of Posen elevated Saxony to a kingdom upon allying with France and joining the Confederation of the Rhine, thereby leaving the Allied Coalition.

On 21 November 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree to bring into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to control the trade of all European countries without consulting their governments. The ostensible goal was to weaken the British economy by closing French-controlled territory to its trade, but British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.

==Polish, Russian and Swedish campaigns==
Towards the end of 1806, the French entered Poland and Napoleon created a new Duchy of Warsaw, to be ruled by his new ally Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. The area of the duchy had already been liberated by a popular uprising that had escalated from anti-conscription rioting. Napoleon then turned north to confront the approaching Russian armies and to attempt to capture the temporary Prussian capital at Königsberg. In pursuit of this aim, twice his attempts to entrap and defeat Bennigsen&#x27;s Russian 1st Army at Pultusk and in the vicinity of Heilsberg during the turn of the year were thwarted. A tactical and bloody draw at Eylau (7–8 February) forced the Russians to withdraw further north. After spending much of the spring recuperating his forces, Napoleon finally routed the Russian army at Friedland (14 June). Following this defeat, Alexander sued for peace with Napoleon at Tilsit (7 July 1807).

Meanwhile, Swedish involvement was primarily concerned with protecting Swedish Pomerania. Despite being defeated at Lübeck, the Swedes successfully defended the fort of Stralsund and pushed the French forces out of Swedish Pomerania in early April, 1807. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed to a ceasefire. However, Swedish refusal to join the Continental System led to a second invasion of Swedish Pomerania led by Marshal Brune. Stralsund fell on 24 August after a siege and the Swedish army abandoned Rügen, thus leaving France in control over Swedish Pomerania; the resulting armistice, agreed by Marshal Brune and Swedish general Johan Christopher Toll, had allowed the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war.

==Results==

Following the Treaties of Tilsit, Britain and Sweden remained the only two major coalition members still at war with France. Russia soon declared war against Britain and after a British attack on Copenhagen, Denmark–Norway joined the war on the side of Napoleon (&quot;Gunboat War&quot;), opening a second front against Sweden. A short British expedition under Sir John Moore was sent to Sweden (May 1808) to protect against any possible Franco-Danish invasion.

At the Congress of Erfurt (September–October 1808) Napoleon and Alexander agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to the Finnish War of 1808–1809 (meaning Sweden played no role in the next coalition against Napoleon) and to the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the Gulf of Bothnia. The eastern part became the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland. Due to the Continental System, Britain was yet again still at war with Napoleon and was not affected by the peace treaty.

In negotiations with captured Swedes after the Battle of Lübeck, Marshal Bernadotte first came to the attention of the Swedish authorities. This would set in motion a chain of events that eventually led to him being elected heir to the Swedish throne, and later King Charles XIV John of Sweden.

As for the French, after the Treaty of Tilsit, the Empire was seemingly at its zenith. Flush with triumph and deeming France free from any immediate obligations in Central and Eastern Europe, Napoleon decided to capture the Iberian ports of Britain&#x27;s long-time ally Portugal. His main aim was to close off another strip of the European coast and a major source for British trade.

On 27 October 1807, Spain&#x27;s Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau with France, by which in return for the alliance and passage of French armies through its realm, Spain would receive Portuguese territory. In November 1807, after the refusal of Prince Regent John of Portugal to join the Continental System, Napoleon sent an army into Spain under General Jean-Andoche Junot with the aim of invading Portugal (as well as the secret task of being the vanguard for the eventual French occupation of Spain). Napoleon soon embroiled himself and France in Spain&#x27;s internal power struggles within its royal family, eventually leading to the Spanish populace turning on the French occupiers and the beginning of the Peninsular War.

<text>Michel Butor (; 14 September 1926 – 24 August 2016) was a French poet, novelist, teacher, essayist, art critic and translator.

==Life and work==
Michel Marie François Butor was born in Mons-en-Barœul, a suburb of Lille, the third of seven children. His parents were Émile Butor (1891–1960), a railroad inspector and Anna ( Brajeux, 1896–1972). He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, graduating in 1947.

In 1950–51, he taught French in Minya, Egypt, followed by teaching assignments in Manchester (1951–53), Thessaloniki (1954–55) and Geneva (1956–57). In 1958, he married Marie-Josèphe (née Mas); they had four daughters.

His first novel, &quot;Passage de Milan&quot;, was published in 1954, followed by &quot;L&#x27;Emploi du temps&quot; (1956), which won the Prix Fénéon, and by &quot;La Modification&quot; in 1957, which won the Prix Renaudot. His final novel, &quot;Degrés&quot;, was published in 1960.

In 1960, he was a visiting professor at Bryn Mawr College and Middlebury College. His travels around the United States at this time resulted in his first experimental book, &quot;Mobile&quot;, published in 1962 to a controversial reception.

In the following years, he wrote in a variety of forms, from essays to poetry to artist&#x27;s books. For artist&#x27;s books he collaborated with artists like Gérard Serée. Literature, painting and travel were subjects particularly dear to Butor. Part of the fascination of his writing is the way it combines the rigorous symmetries that led Roland Barthes to praise him as an epitome of structuralism (exemplified, for instance, by the architectural scheme of &quot;Passage de Milan&quot; or the calendrical structure of &quot;L&#x27;emploi du temps&quot;) with a lyrical sensibility more akin to Baudelaire than to Robbe-Grillet.

Journalists and critics have associated his novels with the nouveau roman, but Butor himself long resisted that association. The main point of similarity is a very general one, not much beyond that; like exponents of the nouveau roman, he can be described as an experimental writer. His best-known novel, &quot;La Modification&quot;, for instance, is written entirely in the second person. In his 1967 &quot;La critique et l&#x27;invention&quot;, he famously said that even the most literal quotation is already a kind of parody because of its &quot;trans-contextualization.&quot;

After meeting in 1977, Butor became a friend of Elinor S. Miller, a French professor at Rollins College at the time. They worked collaboratively on translations, catalogues and lectures. In 2002, Miller published a book on Butor entitled &quot;Prisms and Rainbows: Michel Butor&#x27;s Collaborations with Jacques Monory, Jiri Kolar, and Pierre Alechinsky.&quot;

In an interview in the Museum of Modern Art, New York, conducted in 2006, the poet John Ashbery described how he wanted to sit next to Michel Butor at a dinner in New York.

In 2013, Butor was awarded the Grand prix de littérature de l&#x27;Académie française. He died on 24 August 2016 in southeastern France.

Michel Butor was a foundational member of The Raymond Roussel Society, established in 2016 alongside notable contemporaries including John Ashbery, Miquel Barceló, Joan Bofill-Amargós, Thor Halvorssen, and Hermes Salceda. The society, dedicated to celebrating and studying the works of the innovative and enigmatic writer Raymond Roussel, brought together a group of intellectuals and artists with a shared passion for Roussel&#x27;s literary legacy. Through this collaboration, Butor&#x27;s influence and expertise contributed significantly to the society&#x27;s mission of exploring Roussel&#x27;s unique literary techniques and promoting a deeper understanding of his innovative contributions to the world of literature.

<doc id="866466" wikidata="Q908568" url="?curid=866466" title="Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond">
<text>Brenda Marjorie Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond, (born 31 January 1945), is a British judge who served as President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom from 2017 until her retirement in 2020.

In 2004, she joined the House of Lords as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. She is the only woman to have been appointed to that position. She served as a Law Lord until 2009 when she, along with the other Law Lords, transferred to the new Supreme Court as a result of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. She served as Deputy President of the Supreme Court from 2013 to 2017.

On 5 September 2017, Lady Hale was appointed under the premiership of Theresa May to serve as President of the Supreme Court, and was sworn in on 2 October 2017. She was the third person and first woman to serve in the role. Lady Hale is one of five women to have been appointed to the Supreme Court (alongside Lady Black of Derwent, Lady Arden of Heswall, Lady Rose of Colmworth and Lady Simler).

Lady Hale became a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong in 2018. In June 2021, she announced her decision not to seek reappointment on the Hong Kong court after the end of her term in July, mentioning the impact of the controversial Hong Kong national security law. She was the first senior British judge to withdraw from Hong Kong&#x27;s top court after the enactment of the security law in 2020.

In 2019, Lady Hale was appointed an Honorary Professor of Law at University College London. Hale has also been Honorary President of the Cambridge University Law Society since 2015.

On 11 January 2020, Lady Hale was succeeded by Lord Reed of Allermuir as President of the Supreme Court.
In 2021, Hale became an honorary fellow of Mansfield College, Oxford.

==Early life==
Brenda Marjorie Hale was born on 31 January 1945 in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire. Both her parents were headteachers. She has two sisters. Hale lived in Redcar until the age of three when she moved with her parents to Richmond, North Yorkshire. She was educated at the Richmond High School for Girls (now part of Richmond School), where she and her two sisters were all head girls. She later studied at Girton College, Cambridge (the first from her school to attend Cambridge), where she read law. Hale was one of six women in her class, which had 110 men, and graduated with a starred first and top of her class in 1966.

After becoming an assistant law lecturer at the Victoria University of Manchester (now the University of Manchester) in 1966 and lecturer in 1968, she was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1969, topping the list in the bar finals for that year.

Working part-time as a barrister, Hale spent 18 years mostly in academia, becoming Reader in 1981 and Professor of Law at Manchester in 1986. Two years earlier, she became the first woman and youngest person to be appointed to the Law Commission, overseeing a number of important reforms in family law during her nine years with the commission. In 1989, she was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

==Judicial career==
Lady Hale was appointed a recorder (a part-time circuit judge) in 1989, and in 1994 became a judge in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice (styled The Honourable Mrs Justice Hale). Upon her appointment, as is convention, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In 1999, Lady Hale followed Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss to become only the second woman to be appointed to the Court of Appeal (styled thereafter The Right Honourable Lady Justice Hale), entering the Privy Council at the same time.

On 12 January 2004, she was appointed the first female Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer as Baroness Hale of Richmond, of Easby in the County of North Yorkshire. She sat in the House of Lords as a Crossbencher.

In June 2013, she was appointed Deputy President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom to succeed Lord Hope of Craighead. In July 2017, she was appointed to be the next President of the Supreme Court, succeeding Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury. She took office in September 2017.

In December 2018, during an interview to mark the centenary of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, Lady Hale argued that the judiciary needed to become more diverse so that the public have greater confidence in judges. Hale called for a more balanced gender representation on the UK&#x27;s highest court and swifter progress promoting those from minority ethnic backgrounds and with &quot;less privileged lives&quot;. However, Lady Hale objected to the idea of positive discrimination because &quot;no one wants to feel they have got the job in any way other than on their own merits&quot;.

In September 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson prorogued Parliament over Brexit. As President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Lady Hale along with all 11 other Justices of the Supreme Court, unanimously found that Johnson&#x27;s prorogation was unlawful, terminating the suspension of Parliament. Hale described the ruling as &quot;a source of, not pride, but satisfaction.&quot; In 2020, reaching the mandatory retirement age, Lady Hale retired from the court.

=== Hong Kong judgeship ===
On 21 March 2018, the Hong Kong judiciary announced her nomination as a non-permanent judge from other common law jurisdictions of the Court of Final Appeal. Her appointment was accompanied by the appointments of Andrew Cheung and Beverley McLachlin. The appointment was gazetted by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie Lam and took effect 30 July 2018 for a three-year term.

In October 2020, after China imposing a controversial national security law on Hong Kong, Lady Hale expressed her concerns about hearing cases in Hong Kong: &quot;I have never sat and it has not been arranged at least for me to sit . . . when that happened I would have a serious moral question to ask myself.&quot;

In June 2021, she revealed her wish of not wanting to be reappointed as a judge in Hong Kong after her three-year term ending in July. As she was making her decision known before a webinar, she also mentioned the impact of the security law and said, &#x27;The jury is out on how they will be able to operate the new national security law. There are all sorts of question marks up in the air.&#x27; However, the Hong Kong Judiciary claimed that her leaving was for personal reasons.

Lady Hale became the first senior British judge to quit Hong Kong&#x27;s top court after her fellow judge, Australian James Spigelman, resigned as a Hong Kong judge in November 2020.

==House of Lords==
Lady Hale became a member of the House of Lords following her appointment as a law lord, and was introduced to the Lords on 12 January 2004.

In September 2023, Lady Hale was identified by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of eleven peers who had not sworn or affirmed the oath of allegiance to King Charles III and could not sit or vote in the House of Lords until they had done so. Describing her appointment as a law lord, Hale stated: &quot;I do not accept that I have neglected any &#x27;duties&#x27; because I was not appointed as a parliamentarian&quot;, and planned to &quot;play a modest part&quot; in the Lords, having retired from judicial office. She made her maiden speech on 23 November 2023, citing &quot;the disruption caused by Covid and [her] own diffidence about whether [she] could make a useful contribution&quot; for not having participated in parliamentary debates since her retirement as a judge.

==Significant lectures==
On 27 June 2011, Lady Hale gave a lecture in memory of Sir Henry Hodge, &quot;Equal Access to Justice in the Big Society&quot; in which she explains the benefits of an inquisitorial Tribunal system over adversarial proceedings.

On 10 September 2015, Lady Hale delivered the Caldwell Public Lecture at the University of Melbourne, Australia, on the topic &quot;Protecting Human Rights in the UK Courts: What are we doing wrong?&quot;.

On 2 November 2018, Lady Hale delivered an SLS Centenary Lecture at the University of Essex, United Kingdom, on the topic of &quot;All Human Beings? Reflection on the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;.

On 7 March 2019, Lady Hale delivered the University of Cambridge Freshfields law lecture, which she entitled &quot;Principle and Pragmatism in Developing Private Law&quot;.

In a 2019 Girton College lecture entitled &quot;100 Years of Women in Law&quot;, Lady Hale described the &quot;Brenda Agenda&quot; as &quot;quite simply, the belief that women are equal to men and should enjoy the same rights and freedoms that they do; but that women&#x27;s lives are necessarily sometimes different from men&#x27;s and the experience of leading those lives is just as valid and important in shaping the law as is the experience of men&#x27;s lives.&quot;

In June 2024, Lady Hale lectured a large audience at Conway Hall organised by Humanists UK and My Death, My Decision, in which she referred to the law preventing medically assisted euthanasia (assisted dying) as &quot;cruel&quot;. This was her first public intervention on the subject since she gave a dissenting opinion in support of the claimant in &quot;R (Nicklinson) v Ministry of Justice&quot; a decade previously.

<text>Henry Porter Baldwin (February 22, 1814 – December 31, 1892), a descendant of pilgrim father Nathaniel Baldwin, was the 15th governor of Michigan and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

==Early life in Rhode Island==
Baldwin was born to John and Margaret (Williams) Baldwin in Coventry, Rhode Island, and attended the common schools. He worked as a store clerk in Pawtucket from age 12 to age 20, after which he engaged in his own business for several years in Woonsocket. In 1835, he married Harriet M. Day (deceased 1862). He married his second wife, Sibyle Lambard, in 1866, who survived him. He is also 3rd cousins once removed with Abraham Baldwin, a signer of the Constitution.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
Baldwin moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he established a wholesale business in boots and shoes in 1838. He was a member of the convention which organized the U.S. Republican Party in Jackson, Michigan, in 1854. He was influential in organizing the sixth Episcopal parish in the northern outskirts of Detroit on December 27, 1858, and in building St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church for the parish. Baldwin donated the church lot and underwrote a large portion of the cost of building a chapel to seat 125 persons (completed November 1859) and paid for the construction of the rectory. He also contributed in large part to the building of the larger 1,300-seat nave, completed in 1861. He was the Senior Warden from the parish&#x27;s founding until his death.

He was director of the Michigan State Bank and president of the Second National Bank of Detroit, 1863–1887. For several years, he was also the director of the Eastern Asylum in Pontiac. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate, 2nd District, 1861–1862. He married his second wife, Sibyle Lambard, on November 21, 1866.

In 1868, Baldwin was elected Governor of Michigan, serving from 1869 to 1873. He was appointed and subsequently elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Zachariah Chandler, serving from November 17, 1879, to March 3, 1881, alongside Thomas W. Ferry. He became Chairman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1880 to 1882. The village of Baldwin, Michigan, was named for him during his time as governor.

==Retirement and death==
Baldwin was not a candidate for reelection to the Senate and resumed his former business pursuits, serving as president of the Detroit National Bank, 1883–1887. He died in Detroit on December 31, 1892, and is interred in Elmwood Cemetery.

<doc id="866485" wikidata="Q684324" url="?curid=866485" title="War of the Fifth Coalition">
<text>The War of the Fifth Coalition was a European conflict in 1809 that was part of the Napoleonic Wars and the Coalition Wars. The main conflict took place in Central Europe between the Austrian Empire of Francis I and Napoleon&#x27;s French Empire. The French were supported by their client states—the Kingdom of Italy, the Confederation of the Rhine and the Duchy of Warsaw. Austria was supported by the Fifth Coalition which included the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, and the Kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily, although the latter two took no part in the fighting. By the start of 1809 much of the French army was committed to the Peninsular War against Britain, Spain and Portugal. After France withdrew 108,000 soldiers from Germany, Austria attacked France to seek the recovery of territories lost in the 1803–1806 War of the Third Coalition. The Austrians hoped Prussia would support them, having recently been defeated by France, but Prussia chose to remain neutral.

On 10 April 1809, Austrian forces under Archduke Charles crossed the border of Bavaria, a French client state. The French response, under Louis-Alexandre Berthier, was disorganised but order was imposed with the arrival of Napoleon on 17 April. Napoleon led an advance to Landshut, hoping to cut off the Austrian line of retreat and sweep into their rear. Charles crossed the Danube at Regensburg, which allowed him to retreat eastwards, although he failed to reach the Austrian capital, Vienna, before the French. A French assault across the Danube was repulsed on 21–22 May at the Battle of Aspern-Essling but a repeat attack was successful in July. Napoleon won a major victory at the 5–6 July Battle of Wagram, which forced the Austrians to sign the Armistice of Znaim on 12 July. Austrian invasions of the Duchy of Warsaw and Saxony (where they fought alongside the Black Brunswickers) were repulsed and they were driven out of their territories in Italy. British forces landed in Walcheren, in the French client state of Holland, but were unable to seize their objective of capturing Antwerp and were later withdrawn.

The war ended with the Treaty of Schönbrunn, which was regarded as harsh towards Austria as she lost her Mediterranean ports and 20% of her population. Despite the eventual French victory, their defeat at Aspern-Essling showed that Napoleon could be defeated on the battlefield. The war led to the Tyrolean Rebellion, the 1809 Gottscheer rebellion and rebellions in Italy which, although suppressed, foreshadowed future nationalist and anti-French risings. After Schönbrunn, Austria became a French ally and this was cemented by the marriage of Napoleon to the Austrian princess Marie Louise.

==Background==
In 1809, Europe was embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against a series of coalitions in the Coalition Wars almost continuously since 1792. A brief period of peace followed the March 1802 Treaty of Amiens before British-French relations deteriorated, leading to the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803. Britain was joined in their coalition by Sweden in 1804 and Russia and Austria in 1805. In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French &quot;Grande Armée&quot; invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The French emperor Napoleon successfully wheeled his army into the Austrian rear and defeated them at the Battle of Ulm, fought from 15 to 20 October. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz. The Treaty of Pressburg, signed soon afterwards, ended Austrian participation in the war. 

Austerlitz incited a major shift in the European balance of power. Prussia felt threatened in the region and, alongside Russia, declared war against France in the 1806 War of the Fourth Coalition. After French victories at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt on 14 October, France occupied the Prussian capital, Berlin. France invaded Poland in November, where Russian forces were stationed, and occupied Warsaw. Russian and French armies fought in February 1807 at the violent, indecisive Battle of Eylau. The action in Poland culminated on 14 June 1807 when the French defeated Russia at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July left France as the dominant power in Western Europe, with many client states including the Duchy of Warsaw. This weakened Prussia and allowed Russia to expand into Finland and South-Eastern Europe.

=== Peninsular War ===

In 1807, France tried to force Portugal to join the Continental System, a commercial embargo against Britain. When the Portuguese prince regent, John, refused to join, Napoleon sent General Junot to invade Portugal in 1807, resulting in the six year Peninsular War. The war weakened the French empire&#x27;s military, particularly after Spanish forces and civilians rebelled against France after Napoleon overthrew the Spanish king. After the French defeat at the Battle of Bailén, Napoleon took command of the French forces, defeating the Spanish armies before returning to France. Jean-de-Dieu Soult drove the British out of Spain in the Battle of Corunna in January 1809.

In the beginning of 1809, the French client kingdom of Spain, ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph Bonaparte, controlled much of Spain and northern Portugal. British and Portuguese forces under Arthur Wellesley launched new offensives from Spring 1809. Spanish regular armies including those led by General Joaquín Blake continued to fight and guerrilla activity in the countryside made French operations hazardous. A significant French presence, numbering 250,000 in June 1809, remained in the peninsula throughout the War of the Fifth Coalition.

The Napoleonic occupation of France&#x27;s own ally Spain persuaded many in Austria that Napoleon could not be trusted and declaring war was the only way to prevent him from destroying the Habsburg monarchy. The Spanish guerrillas inspired popular resistance against Napoleon, and the Austrians hoped that French preoccupation in Spain would make it easier to defeat France.

=== Austria plans for war ===

After Austria was defeated in 1805, the nation spent three years reforming its army. Encouraged by the events in Spain, Austria sought another confrontation with France to avenge their defeats and regain lost territory and power. Austria lacked allies in central Europe; Russia, its main ally in 1805, made peace with Napoleon at Tilsit and was engaged in wars with erstwhile allies like Britain in the Anglo-Russian War (1807–12), Sweden in the Finnish War and the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812). France tried to reinforce their relationship with Russia through the September–October 1808 Congress of Erfurt. Under the treaty Russia agreed to support France if it was attacked by Austria. In early 1809, Austrian minister Johann Philipp Stadion secured Russian tsar Alexander I&#x27;s agreement that the Russians would move slowly and &quot;avoid every collision and every act of hostility&quot; during any advance into Austria. At the same time, the French minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord secretly advised Alexander to resist France. During the War of the Fifth Coalition, Russia remained neutral even though they were allied to France.

Austria hoped Prussia would assist them in a war with France but a letter from Prussian minister Baron von Stein discussing the negotiations was intercepted by French agents and published in the &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; on 8 September. Napoleon confiscated Stein&#x27;s holdings in Westphalia and pressured King Frederick William III into dismissing him, and Stein fled into exile in Austria. On the same day that Stein was compromised the Convention of Paris agreed a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Prussia, where French garrisons had been in place since the end of the War of the Fourth Coalition. The withdrawal was contingent on the payment of heavy reparations, totalling 140 million francs, over 30 months. The Prussian Army was also limited in size to 42,000 men, one sixth of its pre-war total. The convention severely restricted the ability of the Prussian state to wage war. Despite this setback Stadion hoped Prussia would change their mind and that an Austrian advance into the French-controlled Confederation of the Rhine in Germany would lead to popular uprisings that would distract the French.

France withdrew 108,000 troops from Germany, more than half their strength there, to reinforce the French armies in Spain in October 1808. This lent support to Stadion&#x27;s pro-war faction at the Austrian court. Stadion recalled Klemens von Metternich, his ambassador to Paris, to convince others to support his plan and by December 1808 Emperor Francis I was persuaded to support the war. Francis&#x27; support was tentative and the decision to proceed was made at an 8 February 1809 meeting that included the emperor, Archduke Charles and Stadion. The empire&#x27;s poor financial situation (it could only afford to maintain its army on home soil until late spring) lent urgency to the decision. Charles disputed the prospects for success but accepted Francis&#x27; decision to prepare for war and the army was mobilised.

Austria and Prussia requested that Britain fund their military campaigns and requested a British military expedition to Germany. In April 1809 the British treasury supplied £20,000 in credit to Prussia, with additional funds promised if Prussia opened hostilities with France. Austria received £250,000 in silver, with a further £1 million promised for future expenses. Britain refused to land troops in Germany but promised an expedition to the low countries and to renew their campaign in Spain. After Prussia decided against war, the Fifth Coalition formally consisted of Austria, Britain, Portugal, Spain, Sicily and Sardinia, though Austria was the majority of the fighting effort.

===Austrian army and strategy ===

Austria built the largest army in its nation&#x27;s history, though its fighting quality was hampered by numerous factors. The men were conscripted from across the Austrian Empire and included Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Poles, Croats and Serbs; some, including the Hungarians, did not enthusiastically support their Austrian rulers. Conscription focused on the lower classes of society and the private soldiers, most of the non-commissioned officers, and many junior officers were illiterate. The army was well drilled in massed column formations which were effective against cavalry but vulnerable to artillery fire, which hampered it in some battles of the campaign. The regular infantry were thought too slow-witted to be trained in skirmishing; this role had traditionally been filled by grenzer light infantry units, but their quality declined since the potential conflicts with the Ottoman Empire ended. The deficiency was only partly remedied by recently created volunteer jäger units. 

The Austrian militia, the Landwehr, were intended as a home defence force but were moved to serve with the field army. The force was equipped with second rate weapons, were poorly trained, and forbidden to accept officers from the landowning classes, leading to poor leadership. They were used later in the war as cannon fodder to divert French fire. The Austrian cavalry was of reasonably good quality, though in 1809 it was hampered by large numbers of its horses being only partly trained. The artillery was not as dynamic as in some contemporary armies, being placed under infantry commanders in the field and lacking proper horse artillery to manoeuvre quickly. The Austrian army was supposed to be supplied by a large wagon train, which restricted its manoeuvrability. Its senior officers were appointed based on aristocratic backgrounds and seniority, rather than ability; this led to elderly generals – the average being 63. The field commander, Archduke Charles, was unable to dismiss any of his commanders. He favoured doctrine over flexibility and expected his generals to follow a guide he had published in 1806. 

Charles and the Aulic Council were divided on the best strategy for the coming war, Charles favoured an offensive launched from Bohemia where there was a concentration of Austrian forces and an attack could quickly isolate the French in northern Germany. The Aulic Council disagreed because the Danube river would split the forces of Charles and his brother Archduke Johann of Austria. They suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube to maintain safer communications with Vienna. In the end the Council prevailed but the disagreement delayed the Austrian preparations by a month. The Austrian plan called for the I Corps under Heinrich Graf von Bellegarde, consisting of 38,000 troops, and the II Corps of 20,000 troops under Johann Kollowrat, to attack Regensburg (Ratisbon) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham. The Austrian center and reserve, comprising 66,000 men of Hohenzollern&#x27;s III Corps, Rosenberg&#x27;s IV Corps, and Lichtenstein&#x27;s I Reserve Corps, would advance on the same objective through Schärding. The left wing, made up of the V Corps of Archduke Louis, Hiller&#x27;s VI Corps, and Kienmayer&#x27;s II Reserve Corps, a total of 61,000 men, would move toward Landshut and guard the army&#x27;s flank. Two other theatres would be opened in Poland and Italy. Historian Steven Englund considers that Austria &quot;might well have won the campaign&quot; if the nation had focused on Germany.

===French preparations===
The French army mostly consisted of veterans of Napoleon&#x27;s earlier campaigns, though recent conscripts formed large parts of some units, negatively affecting their fighting ability. The army was enthusiastic and keen to fight well under Napoleon&#x27;s direct leadership. Napoleon was not certain about Austrian planning and intentions. He returned to Paris from his campaigns in Spain in winter 1808–09 and instructed the main French field commander in southern Germany, Louis Alexandre Berthier, on planned deployments and concentrations for this likely new second front. His rough ideas about the possible upcoming campaign included the decision to make the Danube valley the main theatre of operations, as he had done in 1805, and to stop Austrian forces that might invade northern Italy by positioning some of his own forces under the command of Eugène de Beauharnais and Auguste Marmont. Faulty intelligence gave Napoleon the impression that the main Austrian attack would come north of the Danube. On 30 March, he wrote a letter to Berthier explaining his intention to mass 140,000 troops in the vicinity of Regensburg (Ratisbon), far to the north of where the Austrians were planning to make their attack. It was expected that this redeployment would take until mid-April to accomplish and Napoleon instructed Berthier that if the attack came before 15 April he was to fall back towards the Lech.

== Austria–Bavaria front ==

===Austria strikes first===
The first indication of an Austrian attack was a formal note sent by Archduke Charles to French Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre on 9 April. It stated that Charles had orders from Francis to invade Bavaria, a French client state under Maximilian I. In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River into Bavaria; there was no formal declaration of war. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces of Lefebvre&#x27;s corps gradually retreated. Davout&#x27;s III Corps withdrew westerwards towards Ingolstadt, anticipating orders to concentrate with other French forces. The Austrian attack had occurred about a week before Napoleon anticipated, disrupting French plans. Napoleon ordered that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg in the west, but his orders arrived fragmented and out of sequence and were poorly interpreted by Berthier who was more accustomed to staff duties than field command. Berthier focussed on an ambiguous sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg &quot;whatever happens&quot;; it is likely that Napoleon intended this to apply only if the Austrians attacked after 15 April. On 14 April Berthier ordered Davout&#x27;s corps, together with those of Lefebvre and Oudinot, to march to Regensburg which Davout had recently vacated. 

The marching and countermarching left the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot; with its two wings separated by and joined by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. On the same day the Austrian advance guard had beaten the Bavarians near Landshut and secured a good crossing place over the Isar by evening. Charles planned to destroy Davout&#x27;s and Lefebvre&#x27;s isolated corps in a double-pincer manoeuvre. Napoleon arrived in Donauwörth on 17 April and took command from Berthier. When Napoleon realised that many of the Austrian forces had crossed the Isar and were marching towards the Danube, he insisted that the entire French army deploy behind the Ilm River in a &quot;bataillon carré&quot; in 48 hours. His orders were unrealistic because he underestimated the number of Austrian troops that were heading for Davout; Napoleon believed Charles only had a single corps over the Isar, but the Austrians had five corps moving towards Regensburg, totalling 80,000 men.

===Landshut Maneuver===

Davout anticipated facing overwhelming forces and withdrew most of his forces, leaving 2,000 men from Regensburg. The northbound Austrian columns in the Kelheim–Abbach zone encountered four columns of Davout&#x27;s men heading west towards Neustadt in the early hours of 19 April. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout&#x27;s sector and devised a new strategy to defeat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, André Masséna&#x27;s corps, augmented by Oudinot&#x27;s forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of threatening the Austrian flank and relieving the pressure on Davout. Napoleon intended the corps of Davout and Lefebvre to pin the Austrians while his other forces swept into the Austrian rear.

The central Austrian V Corps were defeated in the Battle of Abensberg, allowing the French to advance. Napoleon was working under false assumptions that made his goals difficult to achieve. Masséna&#x27;s advance to Landshut required too much time, permitting Hiller to escape south over the Isar. The Danube bridge, which provided easy access to Regensburg, and the east bank had not been demolished. This allowed Austrians to cross the river and stopped France from destroying the forces. On 20 April, the Austrians had suffered 10,000 casualties, lost 30 guns, 600 caissons, and 7,000 other vehicles, but were still a potent fighting force. With the main French army near Landshut, if Charles had attacked Davout he could have destroyed his corps and fallen on the rear of Napoleon&#x27;s force. He retained the bridge at Regensburg and the road to Straubing and Vienna as an avenue of retreat.

On 21 April, Napoleon received a dispatch from Davout that spoke of the Battle of Teugen-Hausen. Davout held his ground; although Napoleon sent reinforcements, about 36,000 French troops had to fight 75,000 Austrians. When Napoleon learned that Charles was not withdrawing to the east, he realigned the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot;″s axis in an operation later called the Landshut Maneuver. All of the French forces, except 20,000 troops under Jean-Baptiste Bessières that were chasing Hiller, attacked Eckmühl to trap the Austrians and relieve their beleaguered comrades. On 22 April, Charles left 40,000 troops under Rosenberg and Hohenzollern to attack Davout and Lefebvre while detaching two corps under Kollowrat and Lichtenstein to march for Abbach and gain undisputed control of the river bank. Napoleon arrived at 1:30 pm while the battle continued. Davout ordered an attack along the entire line despite numerical inferiority; the 10th Light Infantry Regiment successfully stormed the village of Leuchling and captured the woods of Unter-Leuchling with heavy casualties. Recognising the threat posed by Napoleon&#x27;s forces on his left flank, Charles ordered a withdrawal towards Regensburg, granting the field to France.

Napoleon sent Masséna to occupy Straubing as he thought the Austrians might retreat along that route. Charles moved his men across the Danube at Regensburg, leaving 6,000 in the fortress to block a pursuit. Lacking time for a siege, Napoleon ordered Marshal Jean Lannes to storm the walls, succeeding at his second attempt and capturing the town by 5:00 pm in the Battle of Ratisbon. With the Austrian army safely in Bohemia, Napoleon marched towards Vienna. Hiller fought a series of delaying actions, attempting to buy time for the defence of Vienna. After a short fight at Wels on 2 May, Hiller gathered 40,000 troops at the bridge in Ebersberg. Masséna launched a costly frontal at the Battle of Ebersberg and captured the position on 3 May, with Hiller withdrawing along the Danube. Charles attempted to move his army to defend Vienna but was outpaced by Napoleon who captured the city on 13 May. The garrison withdrew north of the Danube and destroyed the bridges behind them.

===Aspern-Essling===
On 16 and 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles arrived in the Marchfeld, a plain northeast of Vienna just across the Danube that served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept most of his forces several miles away from the riverbank, hoping to concentrate them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles learned from his observers on the Bissam hill that the French were building a bridge at Kaiserebersdorf, just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On 21 May, Charles concluded that the French were crossing at Kaiserebersdorf and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns, organized into five columns. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon did not expect to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern-Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been set ablaze.

The Battle of Aspern-Essling started at 2:30 pm on 21 May. The initial attacks were made by the first three columns on Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods but were poorly coordinated and failed. Later assaults succeeded in taking and holding the western portion of the village. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6:00 pm because the fourth and fifth columns had longer marching routes. The French successfully repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the day. Fighting commenced by 3 am on 22 May, and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon had 71,000 men and 152 guns on the other side of the river, but the French were still outnumbered. Napoleon launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and secure a victory. Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians, inspired by the personal presence of Charles who rallied the Zach Infantry Regiment, opened a heavy fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back. At 9:00 am, the French bridge broke again. Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for the final time, but struggled to capture Essling. A few hours later, the Austrians returned and took all of Essling except the staunchly defended granary. Napoleon ordered the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp, to support a withdrawal from the granary. Rapp disobeyed his orders and led a bayonet charge that drove the Austrians from Essling, for which he was later commended by Napoleon. Napoleon realised his bridgehead was untenable and ordered a withdrawal, giving command to Lannes. Lannes was struck by a cannonball and mortally wounded. The French withdrew to Lobau by nightfall, burning their pontoons bridge in behind them. Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon&#x27;s military career and caused the first fatality among his marshals, but his exhausted army could not pursue the French.

===Wagram===
After the defeat at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks to plan and prepare contingencies before making another attempt at crossing the Danube. The French brought more troops, more guns, and instituted better defensive measures to ensure the success of the next crossing. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube, with more than 188,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles (8 km) away, centered on the village of Wagram. Napoleon ordered a general advance at noon on 5 July; an early attack by Masséna on the left flank captured Leopold and Süssenbrunn but the French were held off elsewhere by a strong Austrian defence.

For 6 July, Charles planned a double-envelopment that required a quick march from the forces of his brother John, who was a few kilometers east of the battlefield. Napoleon&#x27;s plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout&#x27;s III Corps while the rest of the army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau&#x27;s VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat&#x27;s III Corps, started the battle on the second day at 4:00 am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, and compromised the French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Masséna&#x27;s corps supported by cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Masséna sent in Molitor&#x27;s reserve division, which slowly captured Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To delay the Austrian army for Davout&#x27;s materializing assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines. To dissuade the Austrians from attacking, Napoleon formed a 112-gun grand battery in the center of his lines. As Davout&#x27;s men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the Austrian forces. With the Austrians at Wagram weakened by the need to reinforce their left against Davout, Oudinot was able to capture the village and split the Austrian army. Upon learning that his brother&#x27;s forces would not arrive until the evening, Charles ordered a withdrawal at 2:30 pm. The Austrians withdrew in good order, the main army westwards and the left-wing to the north.

The French suffered heavy losses, around 32,000 men, with their commanders particularly affected as around 40 French generals were killed and wounded; Austrian losses stood at around 35,000. Fighting was renewed at Znaim on 10–11 July. On 12 July, Charles signed the Armistice of Znaim, which led to lengthy peace negotiations between Napoleon and Metternich.

== Other theatres ==

=== Italian front ===
In Italy, Archduke John battled Napoleon&#x27;s stepson Eugène. The Austrians defended against several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eugène to fall back on Verona and the Adige river. Eugène was able to concentrate his forces while John detached troops to support Charles. John won victory at the 30 April Battle of Caldiero but was forced to retreat due to Eugène&#x27;s increasing superiority and the movements on the Austria-Bavaria front. John was defeated in the 8 May Battle of Piave River and forced out of Italy. Eugène pursued John into Hungary where he heavily defeated him at the Battle of Raab. Eugène detached MacDonald to pursue John and joined Napoleon at Vienna with the rest of his army. 

In the Dalmatian Campaign, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eugène, was fighting against an Austrian invasion led by General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a counteroffensive in the mountains on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops. Further attacks in May led to a series of victories against a dispersed Austrian force. By the end of the month Marmont was able to march with the bulk of his troops to join the emperor at Vienna.

=== Walcheren Campaign ===

In July 1809, the British launched the Walcheren Campaign in the Netherlands to relieve the pressure on the Austrians and to weaken French naval power. The plan was to land a force at Walcheren and advance along the Western Scheldt to the harbour of Antwerp, a French naval base. The Royal Navy&#x27;s patrols into the Western Scheldt and a dockyard strike at Antwerp alerted the French to the area&#x27;s vulnerability and efforts were made to improve the defences and reinforce its garrisons. John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham&#x27;s force of over 39,000, a larger army than that serving in the Iberian Peninsula and the largest British Expeditionary Force of the Napoleonic Wars, landed at Walcheren on 30 July. The expedition was not capable of landing sufficient troops on the southern side of the Western Scheldt to capture the reinforced garrison at Cadzand due to a lack of boats. An advance on Antwerp depended on the capture of Flushing on the northern shore to allow the passage of Royal Navy vessels up the Western Scheldt. 

It took until 13 August for siege batteries to be set up and Flushing did not surrender until 16 August. The British forces had meanwhile been suffering from &quot;Walcheren Fever&quot;, thought to be a combination of Malaria and Typhus, and lost 4,000 men to the disease during the campaign. By comparison only 106 men were killed in action. By 24 August Chatham had decided that the fever had reduced his force too much and the defences of Antwerp were too strong to assault. The campaign ended without the British achieving any of their main objectives. The first British troops were withdrawn on 7 September, though a disease-ravaged garrison was maintained until 9 December. The failure of the campaign led to the resignation of the British prime minister, the Duke of Portland, and his replacement by Spencer Perceval.

=== Austro-Polish War ===
Austria invaded the Duchy of Warsaw with initial success. Poniatowski&#x27;s army lost to the Austrians at the Battle of Raszyn on 19 April and Warsaw was occupied four days later, with the occupation lasting until 1 June. The Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered by Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and did not allow them to advance. 

After the Austrian invasion of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia reluctantly entered the war against Austria to fulfil their treaty of alliance with France. The Russian army, under the command of General Sergei Golitsyn, crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyn advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and shared some operational intelligence. A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrei Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander, resulting in Gorchakov&#x27;s removal from command by Alexander. There were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.

=== The war at sea ===

Since the Napoleonic Wars started, British fleets launched numerous attacks on French fleets, ports, or colonies and British and French navies continued their fighting in 1809. Britain overwhelmed France in the Atlantic after the French defeat at Trafalgar Campaign and Atlantic campaign of 1806, and remnants of French fleet was stationed at bases in Bay of Biscay. French colonies on the Caribbean and the Atlantic provided shelters and could be major threats to the British fleet. 

The French Atlantic Fleet was blockaded in Brest by a British force under James Gambier but the French were keen to intervene in the Caribbean following the British invasion of Martinique in January 1809. A storm in February scattered Gambier&#x27;s fleet and allowed the French, under Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez, to put to sea and move to anchor in the Basque Roads. On 23 February three French frigates attempting to join the main fleet were damaged in the Battle of Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne. A stalemate ensued with the French anchored under the guns of coastal batteries but blockaded by the British. 

Willaumez was replaced by Zacharie Allemand on 16 March, who consolidated the anchorage defences. The British Admiralty sent Captain Lord Cochrane to lead an attack on the French. Cochrane&#x27;s 11 April assault with fireships caused panic in the French fleet and many vessels ran aground. Gambier failed to capitalise on the situation by sending in the main British fleet, though Cochrane&#x27;s smaller force destroyed a number of vessels over the following days. The action confined most of the French navy to its anchorages and enabled the Spanish reconquest of Santo Domingo and the British capture of Guadeloupe in early 1810.

== Rebellions against French rule ==

===Italian rebellions ===
Archduke John issued proclamations in April 1809 calling on the population of Veneto to rise up against the French for the sake of Italian nationalism. A portion of the population of Venice, including many criminals, rose up and took over public buildings, destroying taxation and conscription records. The revolt continued after the withdrawal of Austrian forces in May, spreading to the rest of Veneto. The rebels were inspired by the Tyrolean Rebellion. The French garrison and militia were unable to contain the rebels, who were unplacated by the abolition of French taxes on flour, meat and wine. Many towns in Veneto came under rebel control and rebels entered Emilia-Romagna where Bologna was threatened and Ferrara was besieged for ten days. The rebellion ended in November 1809 and Napoleon reacted strongly: 4,000 troops were sent to Bologna from Naples and 675 citizens arrested, of whom 150 were killed. In the mountains and marshes of the region, some rebels remained and acted as brigands until the end of French occupation.

=== Rebellion in Tyrol ===
In Tyrol, Andreas Hofer led a rebellion against Bavarian rule and French domination that resulted in early isolated victories in the first Battles of Bergisel. Hofer freed the Tyrol of Bavarian occupation by late August but on 29 September an Italian force under Luigi Gaspare Peyri captured Trento, though they could advance no further. The next month, with troops made available after the Treaty of Schönbrunn, a Bavarian force under Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon travelled to end the rebellion. Supported by Franco-Italian forces, a three-pronged attack occupied the region with 45,000 troops by early November. Hofer went into hiding but was betrayed by one of his men in January 1810 and executed by the French.

=== Gottscheer rebellion ===

One of the counties ceded to France was Gottschee (in modern-day Slovenia), which was to form part of the Illyrian Provinces. The ethnic German population, the Gottscheers, led by Johann Erker, rebelled against the French garrison. Rebels were quickly defeated and the French intended to burn down the city of Gottschee. After petitions from local clergy this was not carried out, but the city was looted for a period of three days from 16 October.

=== Black Brunswickers ===
The Duchy of Brunswick had been incorporated in to the French client state of the Kingdom of Westphalia but its duke, Frederick William, sided with the Austrians in 1809. His force of a few thousand volunteer Brunswickers fought alongside Austrian troops under General Kienmayer in Saxony, a French client state led by Frederick Augustus I. They were successful, defeating a corps under the command of Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the Saxon capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. By this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the Armistice of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.

== Aftermath ==

After the main Austrian force was defeated at Wagram, the nation&#x27;s forces collapsed, according to historian Charles Esdaile, and Emperor Francis was forced to sue for peace. Englund attributes the end to &quot;diplomatic considerations&quot; and believes that Austria could have continued to fight. The Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political toll on the Austrians. Metternich and Charles succeeded in negotiating lighter terms in return for Austrian co-operation and most of the hereditary Habsburg territories were preserved. The lands given to the French were significant and included Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, removing Austria&#x27;s access to the Mediterranean. West Galicia was given to the Duchy of Warsaw. The lands of the short-lived Duchy of Salzburg, acquired by Austria as territorial compensation for losses on the Adriatic Coast and the loss of Tyrol in the Peace of Pressburg, were transferred to Bavaria. Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of the kingdom&#x27;s total population. Emperor Francis agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions. After the Austrian defeat, Napoleon married the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Napoleon hoped the marriage would cement a Franco-Austrian alliance and provide legitimacy to his regime. The alliance gave Austria respite from war with France, which it had pursued on and off for ten years, and restored her status as a great European power; marital ties did not prevent Francis from declaring war on France in 1813.

The impact of the conflict was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was discontent over French rule among the German population. Just a few days before the conclusion of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, an 18-year-old German named Friedrich Staps approached Napoleon during an army review and attempted to stab the emperor, but he was intercepted by General Rapp. The emerging forces of German nationalism were strongly rooted by this time, and the War of the Fifth Coalition nurtured their development. In 1813, during the War of the Sixth Coalition, there were anti-French risings and spontaneous guerrilla activity, though whether this was fuelled by pan-German nationalism or patriotism for the old order is debated by historians; a united Germany did not come about until 1871.

The war undermined French military superiority and the Napoleonic image. The Battle of Aspern-Essling was the first major defeat in Napoleon&#x27;s career and was warmly greeted by much of Europe. The Austrians had shown that strategic insight and tactical ability were no longer a French monopoly. The decline in the tactical skill of the French infantry led to increasingly heavy columns of foot soldiers eschewing manoeuvres and relying on sheer weight of numbers to break through, a development best emphasized by MacDonald&#x27;s attack at Wagram. The &quot;Armée d&#x27;Allemagne&quot; did not have the qualitative edge of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; partly because raw conscripts replaced many of the veterans of Austerlitz and Jena, eroding tactical flexibility. Napoleon&#x27;s armies were increasingly composed of non-French contingents, undermining morale. Although Napoleon&#x27;s manoeuvers were successful, as evidenced by overturning the awful initial French position, the growing size of his armies made military strategies more difficult to manage. The scale of warfare grew too large for Napoleon to fully manage, which became evident during the next Napoleonic war, the French invasion of Russia in 1812.

Englund describes the war as &quot;the first modern war&quot; for the use of &quot;symmetrical conscript armies of singularly large size,&quot; that were divided into corps and commanded decentralized in theatres. He concludes that &quot;it was a war of magnitude and maneuver more than before and the decisive factor was attrition more than dramatic one-(or two-)day pitched battles.&quot;

<text>The Treaty of Schönbrunn (; ), sometimes known as the Peace of Schönbrunn or the Treaty of Vienna, was signed between France and Austria at Schönbrunn Palace near Vienna on 14 October 1809. The treaty ended the Fifth Coalition during the Napoleonic Wars, after Austria had been defeated at the decisive Battle of Wagram on 5–6 July.

==Prelude==
During the Peninsular War and the Spanish resistance against Napoleon, Austria had tried to reverse the 1805 Peace of Pressburg by sparking national uprisings in the French-occupied territories of Central Europe (most notably the Tyrolean Rebellion against Napoleon&#x27;s Bavarian allies). 

These attempts ultimately failed, after French forces occupied Vienna in May 1809. The Austrians under Archduke Charles were able to repulse them at the Battle of Aspern on 21-22 May; however, Napoleon withdrew his forces and crushed Charles&#x27; army at Wagram a few weeks later. The archduke had to sign the Armistice of Znaim on 12 July. In October, Austrian Foreign Minister Johann Philipp Stadion was superseded by Klemens von Metternich.

==Terms==

France imposed harsh peace terms: Austria had to cede the Duchy of Salzburg to Bavaria and lost its access to the Adriatic Sea by waiving the Littoral territories of Gorizia and Gradisca and the Imperial Free City of Trieste, together with Carniola, the March of Istria, western (&quot;Upper&quot;) Carinthia with East Tyrol, and the Croatian lands southwest of the river Sava to the French Empire (see Illyrian Provinces). West Galicia was ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw, and Tarnopol district to the Russian Empire. 

Austria recognized Napoleon&#x27;s previous conquests from other nations as well as the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain. Austria also paid to France a large indemnity and the Austrian army was reduced to 150,000 men - a promise not fulfilled. The Graz Schlossberg fortress, whose garrison had firmly resisted the French occupation forces, was largely demolished.

Austria also had to apply Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System, as Britain remained at war with France. One contemporary British view on the treaty was:
Though considerably weakened, Austria remained a European great power. Emperor Francis I approached to the French by marrying his daughter Marie Louise off to Napoleon (whom she at first detested) in 1810. As a result of Metternich&#x27;s change of policies, the Austrian forces joined the French invasion of Russia in 1812.

==Assassination attempt==

During the negotiations at Schönbrunn, Napoleon narrowly escaped an attempt on his life. On 12 October, shortly before signing the treaty, the emperor exited the palace with a large entourage to observe a military parade. Seventeen year old Friedrich Staps, son of a Lutheran pastor from Naumburg, had arrived in Vienna and demanded an audience to present a petition. He was refused by the emperor&#x27;s aide General Jean Rapp, who shortly thereafter observed Staps in the courtyard pushing through the crowd towards Napoleon from a different direction, and had him arrested. 

Taken to the palace, Staps was found to be carrying a large kitchen knife inside his coat, concealed in the petition papers. Interrogated, Staps frankly revealed his plans to kill the emperor, calling him the misfortune of his country. Brought forward to Napoleon, he asked whether Staps would thank him if he was pardoned, to which Staps replied: &quot;I would kill you none the less.&quot;

Napoleon left Vienna on 16 October and the next day Staps was shot by Württemberg fusiliers outside the palace. At this execution, he is said to have shouted &quot;Long live freedom! Long live Germany!&quot; Napoleon, impressed and fearing a greater conspiracy, instructed his police minister Joseph Fouché to keep the incident secret.

Soon after the German campaign of 1813, Staps came to be seen as a martyr of the burgeoning German nationalism. He was the subject of a poem by Christian Friedrich Hebbel and a play by Walter von Molo.

<text>Marjetica Potrč (; born 1953) is an artist and architect based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Potrč&#x27;s interdisciplinary practice includes on-site projects, research, architectural case studies, and drawings (visual essays and diagrams). Her work documents and interprets contemporary architectural practices (in particular, with regard to energy infrastructure and water use) and the ways people live together. She is especially interested in social architecture and how communities and governments can work together to make stronger, more resilient cities. In later projects, she has also focused on the relationship between human society and nature, and advocated for the rights of nature.

Her work almost always involves collaborations, both with other artists, architects, and specialists from various disciplines as well as with local communities. &quot;Her projects display a unique sensibility for identifying the existing social capital in a community, which she utilizes as she works to find solutions to everyday problems.&quot; (statement from the Curry Stone Foundation). Through these collaborations, including, especially, with the students in her Design for the Living World class, her work explores new methodologies, tools, and strategies that local residents can use to make their communities and living environments better able to respond to future challenges. She describes such collaborative work as a &quot;partnership in knowledge exchange&quot; and stresses the importance of developing new alliances, such as between environmentalists and Indigenous peoples, to create a new &quot;hybrid&quot; knowledge that goes beyond the standardized, objective knowledge of the modernist discourse.

==Background and early career==
Potrč was born in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Her parents were both writers. Her father, Ivan Potrč, was a well-known Slovenian social realist novelist and playwright, originally from the Styria region, and the main editor at the Mladinska Knjiga publishing house. Her mother, Branka Jurca, was a teacher, magazine editor, and well-known children’s author. She was born in the Karst region of western Slovenia but moved to Maribor, where she met Marjetica&#x27;s father.

Marjetica Potrč received degrees in architecture (1978) and sculpture (1986, 1988) from the University of Ljubljana. In 1990, she moved to the United States. Her installations from this period often involved various kinds of walls; for example, &quot;Two Faces of Utopia&quot; (1993, made for the Slovenian Pavilion at the Venice Biennial), and the series &quot;Theatrum Mundi: Territories&quot; (1993–1996). At the time, she noted: &quot;I don&#x27;t make objects. I build walls&quot; – a statement that positions her work against object-based sculpture. In 1994, she moved back to Ljubljana. Since then, Potrč&#x27;s work has developed at the intersection of visual art, architecture, and the social sciences.

==Work==
===On-site projects===

In 2003, Potrč was invited to spend six months in Caracas, Venezuela, as part of the Caracas Case Project, and carry out research on the informal city. There, in collaboration with the Israeli architect Liyat Esakov and local residents, she developed the project &quot;Dry Toilet&quot;, in which an ecologically safe, waterless toilet was installed in the upper part of the La Vega barrio, a district in Caracas that has no access to the municipal water grid. &quot;Dry Toilet&quot; is one of a series of community-focused on-site projects by Potrč that are characterized by participatory design and a concern with sustainability issues, particularly in relation to energy and water infrastructures. Other important projects are &quot;Power from Nature&quot; (Barefoot College, Rajasthan, India, and the Catherine Ferguson Academy, Detroit, Mich., USA, 2005), &quot;The Cook, the Farmer, His Wife and Their Neighbour&quot; (Stedelijk Goes West, Amsterdam, 2009), &quot;Rainwater Harvesting on a Farm in the Venice Lagoon&quot; (Sant&#x27;Erasmo Island, Venice Lagoon, 2010), &quot;The Soweto Project&quot; (9UB, Soweto, South Africa, 2014), and &quot;Of Soil and Water: King&#x27;s Cross Pond Club&quot; (Relay Art Programme, King&#x27;s Cross, London, 2015). In Potrč&#x27;s view, sustainable solutions that are implemented and disseminated by communities serve to empower these communities and help create a democracy built from below.

From 2011 to 2018, Marjetica Potrč was a professor of social design at the University of Fine Arts/HFBK in Hamburg, Germany, where she taught Design for the Living World, a class on participatory practices. She and her students carried out participatory design projects in various countries around the globe (Germany, Greece, Israel, Mexico, the United States, and South Africa, to name just a few). In these projects, Potrč and her students saw themselves as mediators and collaborators with the community and developed new methodologies and a new vocabulary for their participatory practice, such as &quot;rituals of transition&quot;, &quot;relational objects&quot;, and &quot;performative actions&quot;, among others.

In an interview with Laura Bernhardt, Potrč noted: &quot;This is how I understand my role as a mediator in participatory practices and in collaborative projects. When, as an artist, designer or architect your involvement is creating and fostering relations, you understand it as a laboratory where you and the others—the local residents—are testing ideas, exchanging knowledge, and becoming involved in local governance. You see that you are not “merely” a co-author but also the mediator of a process. And what can be better? The artist or designer involved in these projects has to trust the conceptual framework of the project. So basically, it’s not about following established values, but about creating new values that correspond to contemporary times.&quot;

&quot;The Soweto Project&quot; (2014) is of particular note. She and the class spent two months in the Soweto district of Johannesburg, where they worked with the residents of the Orlando East neighborhood to transform a degraded public space that was being used as a dumping ground into a community space.

Since 2010, Potrč has collaborated on a number of projects with the architectural and design practice Ooze (Eva Pfannes and Sylvain Hartenberg), based in Rotterdam. These projects, which focus largely on water purification, include &quot;Between the Waters: The Emscher Community Garden&quot; in Essen, Germany (2010), where they constructed a complete sustainable water supply system on an island in the Emscher River; &quot;Of Soil and Water: King&#x27;s Cross Pond Club&quot;, in London (2015), where they created a natural swimming pond with its own micro-ecological environment on a construction site; and &quot;Future Island&quot;, on the Albano Campus of Stockholm University (2023), in which they created an island with separate heated and unheated zones that stage the effects of climate change in real time.

===Architectural case studies===
Potrč&#x27;s large gallery installations, which she calls &quot;architectural case studies,&quot; are a unique practice that has long been a central part of her work. These houses, which she describes as &quot;theatrical objects&quot;, represent real-life architectural practices as they relate to environmental, social, economic, and political issues. The source of the work is always acknowledged, and a black-and-white documentary photograph of the original situation is presented as part of the documentation.

For example, &quot;Hybrid House: Caracas, West Bank, West Palm Beach&quot; (Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, Lake Worth, Florida, 2003), illustrates how three very different 21st-century communities — a Caracas barrio, a Jewish settlement on the West Bank, and a temporary housing community in West Palm Beach, Florida — negotiate issues of space, security, energy, water, and communications in contested environments.

Another architectural case study, &quot;Duncan Village Core Unit&quot;, first presented in 2002 at Galerie Nordenhake in Berlin, offers an example of collaboration between municipal government (in this case, in East London, South Africa) and residents: the city provided service core units connected to the water, energy, and sewage infrastructure, and the new residents built their homes around them. In later installations, new elements were added, such as a water tank, a satellite dish, a sunshade, a house, and urban agriculture, to illustrate the kind of growing structure built by the residents.

Potrč describes the architectural case study &quot;Caracas: Growing Houses&quot;, first exhibited in &quot;Architektonika 2&quot;, at the Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum of Contemporary Art in Berlin in 2012, as a &quot;three-dimensional portrait of an informal city.&quot; Two self-built houses from a Caracas barrio negotiate their presence and shared infrastructure. In contrast to the modernist city of Caracas, the rural-like informal city of the barrios foregrounds community and not individualism. The houses &quot;grow&quot; in two ways, Potrč explains. First, because you see that this is self-built architecture, and second, because the architecture grows and changes as the families who live there grow and interact with each other: &quot;Existence is always a coexistence.&quot;

&quot;The School of the Forest/Miami Campus&quot; (2015) is an architectural case study of a community center in the Amazonian state of Acre, in Brazil. It draws its inspiration from the Universidade da Floresta, an initiative launched in Acre in 2005, that brings together knowledge from local communities with scientific knowledge, treating both systems with equal respect. In the exhibition at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, a series of lectures, seminars, and workshops were held in the building constructed in the gallery.
The case study &quot;The House of Agreement Between Humans and the Earth&quot; (2022), inspired by the &quot;palafitas&quot; of Amazonia, is a simple wooden house held together by fiber rope. The work combines built architecture with the notion of social architecture in dialogue with nature. The base, representing earth, supports the world of social agreements, including agreements between humanity and nature. Ropes extending to the gallery ceiling – connecting earth and sky – represent human dependence on and coexistence with nature. Drawn images on the structure illustrate such agreement as reflected in society and the life of the planet, in particular the struggle for the rights of nature in Australia. The work was exhibited at the 23rd Biennale of Sydney in 2022.

===Research projects===
Ever since her six-month research residency in Caracas, in 2003, Potrč&#x27;s practice has included extended research projects in regions that are reinventing themselves. Among these, the most significant have been her projects in the Amazonian state of Acre in western Brazil in 2006 (in conjunction with the São Paulo Art Biennial); the &quot;Lost Highway Expedition&quot;, in nine cities in the Western Balkans, which she co-organized in collaboration with a group of artists and architects; her research project on water issues in post-Katrina New Orleans (2007); and her multipartite installation for the 23rd Biennale of Sydney (2022), which focused on the rights of rivers and the human relationship with nature, in which she collaborated with the Wiradjuri elder Ray Woods. As noted earlier, collaboration with individuals, groups, and organizations is an integral part of nearly all her research projects.

===Visual essays and diagrams===

These research projects provide the basis not only for her architectural case studies but also for visual essays and large-format diagrams, which present her findings to wider audiences. Potrč constructs her visual essays as narratives that use simple images and text to convey and interpret the challenges and strategies of the communities she has studied. Such works include, among others, &quot;The Struggle for Spatial Justice&quot; (2005), &quot;Florestania&quot; (2006), 
&quot;The Citizens of Duncan Village Speak Out&quot; (2012), &quot;The Struggle for Natural Justice&quot; (2017), and, for the Biennale of Sydney, &quot;The Rights of a River&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Life of the Lachlan River&quot; (2022). Her diagrams include &quot;The Great Republic of New Orleans&quot; (2007), &quot;The Earth Drawings&quot; (2009–2019), and &quot;The World in the Age of Stories&quot; (2020). The diagrams are often exhibited as wall drawings, as in her presentation at 23rd Biennale of Sydney.

<text>Stanley Medical College (SMC) is a public medical college located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Though the original hospital is more than 200 years old, the medical college was formally established on 2 July 1938.

The medical college and the hospital include a Centre of Excellence for Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery and a separate cadaver maintenance unit, the first in the country. By legacy, the hospital&#x27;s anatomy department receives corpses for scientific study from the Monegar Choultry from which the hospital historically descended.

==History==

Stanley Medical College and Hospitals is one of the oldest centers in India in the field of medical education. The seed for this institution was sown as early as 1740 when the East India Company first created the medical department. The Stanley Hospital now stands on the old site of the Monegar Choultry established in 1782. In 1799, the Madras Native Infirmary was established with Monegar Choultry and leper asylum providing medical services.

In 1830, philanthropist Raja Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar endowed a hospital and dispensary in the Native Infirmary. In 1836, Madras University established M.B. &amp; G.M. and L.M &amp; S medical courses in the Native Infirmary. In 1903, a hospital assistant course was introduced with the help of the East India Company. In 1911, the first graduating class was awarded their Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP) diplomas.
In 1933, a five-year D.M. &amp; S (Diploma in Medicine &amp; Surgery) course was inaugurated by Lt. Colonel Sir George Fredrick Stanley, a British parliamentarian. The school was named after him by the Governor of Madras Presidency on 2 July 1938. In 1941, three medical and surgical units were created. This was expanded to seven medical and surgical units in 1964. In 1938, 72 students studied, and then from 1963, 150 students were admitted each year.

In 1990, the Institute of Social Paediatrics was established. Initially established as a centre for children and for improving research programmes. The institute houses several departments of the hospital including nephrology, dermatology, and neurology and provides treatment for adult patients from Stanley.

==Hospital==

The college is associated with the Government Stanley Hospital which has 1580 beds for in-patient treatment. The hospital has an out-patient attendance of around 5000 patients per day. It has an 8-storey surgical complex equipped to perform up to 40 surgeries simultaneously, and a separate pediatrics block with all specialities under one roof.

==Admissions==
Admissions to Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) and post-graduate (MD, MS, other diplomas and higher specialties) are through state (85% seats) and national (15%) entrance examinations. Reservations of seats and reduced tuition are available to reserved communities. Admissions are open only to Indian citizens and are highly competitive. Admissions to the MBBS program (about 250 seats per year) are based on NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test). Several seats in post-graduate programs are reserved for physicians in government service.

<doc id="866514" wikidata="Q7799154" url="?curid=866514" title="Thunderhill Raceway Park">
<text>Thunderhill Raceway Park is a motorsports complex located west of Willows, California, United States, in the Sacramento Valley. It is the venue for the longest automobile race in the United States, the 25 Hours of Thunderhill, held annually during the first weekend in December.

Thunderhill has two tracks: the original track known as Thunderhill East and a track known as Thunderhill West. The two tracks can also be combined to offer a track. Thunderhill also offers two large skid pad areas as well for drifting and car control events.

The venue is available for a wide variety of events or functions. It can be rented for racing events, lapping day events, drifting events, go kart events, driving schools, ride and drive programs, corporate events, commercials, a movie location, trade shows, weddings, receptions, swap meets etc.

San Francisco Region Properties, Inc., dba Thunderhill Park is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the San Francisco Region Sports Car Club of America. Thunderhill Raceway has its own board of directors and is operated completely independently of the non-profit subsidiary.

==History==

Thunderhill Raceway Park was built in 1993 originally as a , 9-turn track. Following the closure of the Baylands Raceway in Fremont, CA, the purchase of the land and construction of Thunderhill was funded by the San Francisco Region Sports Car Club of America.

In late 1997, the track was expanded to its present-day configuration, adding six new turns, a bypass for the &quot;cyclone&quot; corner, and additional paved paddock space.

Thunderhill West was conceptualized in 2013 and built in 2014 as a standalone track. Connectors were made to connect the original track with the new west track to make a five-mile-long track. At the time of construction, this was the longest racetrack in California, and it gained the nickname &quot;Thunderschleife&quot; as a nod to the Nurburgring Nordschleife.

<text>Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security technique involved in preventing exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. In order to prevent an attacker from reliably redirecting code execution to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries.

== History ==
The Linux PaX project first coined the term &quot;ASLR&quot;, and published the first design and implementation of ASLR in July 2001 as a patch for the Linux kernel. It is seen as a complete implementation, providing a patch for kernel stack randomization since October 2002.

The first mainstream operating system to support ASLR by default was OpenBSD version 3.4 in 2003, followed by Linux in 2005.

== Benefits ==
Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses. For example, attackers trying to execute return-to-libc attacks must locate the code to be executed, while other attackers trying to execute shellcode injected on the stack have to find the stack first. In both cases, the system makes related memory-addresses unpredictable from the attackers&#x27; point of view. These values have to be guessed, and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing.

=== Effectiveness ===
Address space layout randomization is based upon the low chance of an attacker guessing the locations of randomly placed areas. Security is increased by increasing the search space. Thus, address space randomization is more effective when more entropy is present in the random offsets. Entropy is increased by either raising the amount of virtual memory area space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs. The period is typically implemented as small as possible, so most systems must increase VMA space randomization.

To defeat the randomization, attackers must successfully guess the positions of all areas they wish to attack. For data areas such as stack and heap, where custom code or useful data can be loaded, more than one state can be attacked by using NOP slides for code or repeated copies of data. This allows an attack to succeed if the area is randomized to one of a handful of values. In contrast, code areas such as library base and main executable need to be discovered exactly. Often these areas are mixed, for example stack frames are injected onto the stack and a library is returned into.

The following variables can be declared:
* formula_1 (entropy bits of stack top)
* formula_2 (entropy bits of codice_1 base)
* formula_3 (entropy bits of main executable base)
* formula_4 (entropy bits of heap base)
* formula_5 (attacked bits per attempt of stack entropy)
* formula_6 (attacked bits per attempt of codice_1 base entropy)
* formula_7 (attacked bits per attempt of main executable entropy)
* formula_8 (attacked bits per attempt of heap base entropy)
* formula_9 (attempts made)
* formula_10 (total amount of entropy: formula_11)

To calculate the probability of an attacker succeeding, a number of attempts carried out without being interrupted by a signature-based IPS, law enforcement, or other factor must be assumed; in the case of brute forcing, the daemon cannot be restarted. The number of relevant bits and how many are being attacked in each attempt must also be calculated, leaving however many bits the attacker has to defeat.

The following formulas represent the probability of success for a given set of attempts on bits of entropy.
* formula_12 (isolated guessing; address space is re-randomized after each attempt)
* formula_13 (systematic brute forcing on copies of the program with the same address space)

In many systems, formula_14 can be in the thousands or millions. On 32-bit systems, a typical amount of entropy &quot;N&quot; is 8 bits. For 2004 computer speeds, Shacham and co-workers state &quot;... 16 bits of address randomization can be defeated by a brute force attack within minutes.&quot; (The authors&#x27; statement depends on the ability to attack the same application multiple times without any delay. Proper implementations of ASLR, like that included in grsecurity, provide several methods to make such brute force attacks infeasible. One method involves preventing an executable from executing for a configurable amount of time if it has crashed a certain number of times.) On 64-bit systems, these numbers typically reach the millions at least.

Android, and possibly other systems, implement &quot;Library Load Order Randomization&quot;, a form of ASLR which randomizes the order in which libraries are loaded. This supplies very little entropy. An approximation of the number of bits of entropy supplied per needed library appears below; this does not yet account for varied library sizes, so the actual entropy gained is really somewhat higher. Attackers usually need only one library; the math is more complex with multiple libraries, and shown below as well. The case of an attacker using only one library is a simplification of the more complex formula for formula_15.
* (number of libraries loaded)
* (number of libraries used by the attacker)
* formula_16

These values tend to be low even for large values of , most importantly since attackers typically can use only the C standard library and thus one can often assume that formula_17. However, even for a small number of libraries there are a few bits of entropy gained here; it is thus potentially interesting to combine library load order randomization with VMA address randomization to gain a few extra bits of entropy. These extra bits of entropy will not apply to other mmap() segments, only libraries.

==== Reducing entropy ====
Attackers may make use of several methods to reduce the entropy present in a randomized address space, ranging from simple information leaks to attacking multiple bits of entropy per attack (such as by heap spraying). There is little that can be done about this.

It is possible to leak information about memory layout using format string vulnerabilities. Format string functions such as printf use a variable argument list to do their job; format specifiers describe what the argument list looks like. Because of the way arguments are typically passed, each format specifier moves closer to the top of the stack frame. Eventually, the return pointer and stack frame pointer can be extracted, revealing the address of a vulnerable library and the address of a known stack frame; this can eliminate library and stack randomization as an obstacle to an attacker.

One can also decrease entropy in the stack or heap. The stack typically must be aligned to 16 bytes, and so this is the smallest possible randomization interval; while the heap must be page-aligned, typically 4096 bytes. When attempting an attack, it is possible to align duplicate attacks with these intervals; a NOP slide may be used with shellcode injection, and the string &quot; can be replaced with &quot; for an arbitrary number of slashes when attempting to return to &quot;system&quot;. The number of bits removed is exactly formula_18 for intervals attacked.

Such decreases are limited due to the amount of data in the stack or heap. The stack, for example, is typically limited to and grows to much less; this allows for at most , although a more conservative estimate would be around 8– corresponding to 4– of stack stuffing. The heap on the other hand is limited by the behavior of the memory allocator; in the case of glibc, allocations above 128 KB are created using mmap, limiting attackers to 5 bits of reduction. This is also a limiting factor when brute forcing; although the number of attacks to perform can be reduced, the size of the attacks is increased enough that the behavior could in some circumstances become apparent to intrusion detection systems.

=== Limitations ===

ASLR-protected addresses can be leaked by various side channels, removing mitigation utility. Recent attacks have used information leaked by the CPU branch target predictor buffer (BTB) or memory management unit (MMU) walking page tables. It is not clear if this class of ASLR attack can be mitigated. If they cannot, the benefit of ASLR is reduced or eliminated.

=== Empirical analysis ===

In August 2024 a paper was published with an empirical analysis of major desktop platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, by examining the variability in the placement of memory objects across various processes, threads, and system restarts. The results show that while some systems as of 2024, like Linux distributions, provide robust randomization, others, like Windows and macOS, often fail to adequately randomize key areas like executable code and libraries. Moreover, they found a significant entropy reduction in the entropy of libraries after the Linux 5.18 version and identify correlation paths that an attacker could leverage to reduce exploitation complexity significantly.

== Implementations ==
Several mainstream, general-purpose operating systems implement ASLR.

=== Android ===
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich provides address space layout randomization (ASLR) to help protect system and third-party applications from exploits due to memory-management issues. Position-independent executable support was added in Android 4.1. Android 5.0 dropped non-PIE support and requires all dynamically linked binaries to be position independent. Library load ordering randomization was accepted into the Android open-source project on 26 October 2015, and was included in the Android 7.0 release.

=== DragonFly BSD ===
DragonFly BSD has an implementation of ASLR based upon OpenBSD&#x27;s model, added in 2010. It is off by default, and can be enabled by setting the sysctl vm.randomize_mmap to 1.

=== FreeBSD ===
Support for ASLR appeared in FreeBSD 13.0. It is enabled by default since 13.2.

=== iOS (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad) ===
Apple introduced ASLR in iOS 4.3 (released March 2011).

KASLR was introduced in iOS 6. The randomized kernel base is , where is a random byte from SHA1 (random data) generated by iBoot (the 2nd-stage iOS Boot Loader).

=== Linux ===
The Linux kernel enabled a weak form of ASLR by default since the kernel version 2.6.12, released in June 2005. The PaX and Exec Shield patchsets to the Linux kernel provide more complete implementations. The Exec Shield patch for Linux supplies 19 bits of stack entropy on a period of 16 bytes, and 8 bits of mmap base randomization on a period of 1 page of 4096 bytes. This places the stack base in an area 8 MB wide containing 524,288 possible positions, and the mmap base in an area 1 MB wide containing 256 possible positions.

ASLR can be disabled for a specific process by changing its execution domain, using codice_3. A number of sysctl options control the behavior of mainline ASLR. For example, controls &quot;what&quot; to randomize; the strongest option is 2. controls how many bits to randomize for mmap.

Position-independent executable (PIE) implements a random base address for the main executable binary and has been in place since April 18, 2004. It provides the same address randomness to the main executable as being used for the shared libraries. The PIE feature cannot be used together with the prelink feature for the same executable. The prelink tool implements randomization at prelink time rather than runtime, because by design prelink aims to handle relocating libraries before the dynamic linker has to, which allows the relocation to occur once for many runs of the program. As a result, real address space randomization would defeat the purpose of prelinking.

In 2014, Marco-Gisbert and Ripoll disclosed &quot;offset2lib&quot; technique that weakens Linux ASLR for PIE executables. Linux kernels load PIE executables right after their libraries; as a result, there is a fixed offset between the executable and the library functions. If an attacker finds a way to find the address of a function in the executable, the library addresses are also known. They demonstrated an attack that finds the address in fewer than 400 tries. They proposed a new option to randomize the placement of the executable relative to the library, but it is yet to be incorporated into the upstream as of 2024.

The Linux kernel 5.18 released May 2022 reduced the effectiveness of both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations. Linux filesystems call codice_4 to respond to a file-backed mmap. With a change in 5.18, files greater than 2 MiB are made to return 2 MiB-aligned addresses, so they can be potentially backed by huge pages. (Previously, the increased alignment only applied to Direct Access (DAX) mappings.) In the meantime, the C library (libc) has, over time, grown in size to exceed this 2 MiB threshold, so instead of being aligned to a (typically) 4 KiB page boundary as before, these libraries are now 2 MiB-aligned: a loss of 9 bits of entropy. For 32-bit Linux, many distributions show no randomization &quot;at all&quot; in the placement of the libc. For 64-bit Linux, the 28 bits of entropy is reduced to 19 bits. In response, Ubuntu has increased its setting. Martin Doucha added a Linux Test Project testcase to detect this issue.

====Kernel address space layout randomization====
Kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) enables address space randomization for the Linux kernel image by randomizing where the kernel code is placed at boot time. KASLR was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.14, released on 30 March 2014. When compiled in, it can be disabled at boot time by specifying as one of the kernel&#x27;s boot parameters.

There are several side-channel attacks in x86 processors that could leak kernel addresses. In late 2017, kernel page-table isolation (KPTI aka KAISER) was developed to defeat these attacks. However, this method cannot protect against side-channel attacks utilizing collisions in branch predictor structures.

, finer grained kernel address space layout randomization (or function granular KASLR, FGKASLR) is a planned extension of KASLR to randomize down to the function level by placing functions in separate sections and reordering them at boot time.

=== Microsoft Windows ===

Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Vista (released January 2007) and later have ASLR enabled only for executables and dynamic link libraries that are specifically linked to be ASLR-enabled. For compatibility, it is not enabled by default for other applications. Typically, only older software is incompatible and ASLR can be fully enabled by editing a registry entry , or by installing Microsoft&#x27;s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit.

The locations of the heap, stack, Process Environment Block, and Thread Environment Block are also randomized. A security whitepaper from Symantec noted that ASLR in 32-bit Windows Vista may not be as robust as expected, and Microsoft has acknowledged a weakness in its implementation.

Host-based intrusion prevention systems such as &quot;WehnTrust&quot; and &quot;Ozone&quot; also offer ASLR for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems. WehnTrust is open-source. Complete details of Ozone&#x27;s implementation are not available.

It was noted in February 2012 that ASLR on 32-bit Windows systems prior to Windows 8 can have its effectiveness reduced in low memory situations. A similar effect also had been achieved on Linux in the same research. The test code caused the Mac OS X 10.7.3 system to kernel panic, so it was left unclear about its ASLR behavior in this scenario.

=== NetBSD ===
Support for ASLR in userland appeared in NetBSD 5.0 (released April 2009), and was enabled by default in NetBSD-current in April 2016.

Kernel ASLR support on amd64 was added in NetBSD-current in October 2017, making NetBSD the first BSD system to support KASLR.

=== OpenBSD ===
In 2003, OpenBSD became the first mainstream operating system to support a strong form of ASLR and to activate it by default.
OpenBSD completed its ASLR support in 2008 when it added support for PIE binaries. OpenBSD 4.4&#x27;s malloc(3) was designed to improve security by taking advantage of ASLR and gap page features implemented as part of OpenBSD&#x27;s codice_5 system call, and to detect use-after-free bugs. Released in 2013, OpenBSD 5.3 was the first mainstream operating system to enable position-independent executables by default on multiple hardware platforms, and OpenBSD 5.7 activated position-independent static binaries (Static-PIE) by default.

=== macOS ===
In Mac OS X Leopard 10.5 (released October 2007), Apple introduced randomization for system libraries.

In Mac OS X Lion 10.7 (released July 2011), Apple expanded their implementation to cover all applications, stating &quot;address space layout randomization (ASLR) has been improved for all applications. It is now available for 32-bit apps (as are heap memory protections), making 64-bit and 32-bit applications more resistant to attack.&quot;

As of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 (released July 2012) and later, the entire system including the kernel as well as kexts and zones are randomly relocated during system boot.

=== Solaris ===
ASLR has been introduced in Solaris beginning with Solaris 11.1 (released October 2012). ASLR in Solaris 11.1 can be set system-wide, per zone, or on a per-binary basis.

==Exploitation==
A side-channel attack utilizing branch target buffer was demonstrated to bypass ASLR protection. In 2017, an attack named &quot;ASLR⊕Cache&quot; was demonstrated which could defeat ASLR in a web browser using JavaScript.

<text>The Dean drive was a device created and promoted by inventor Norman Lorimer Dean (1902–1972) that he claimed to be a reactionless drive. Dean claimed that his device was able to generate a uni-directional force in free space, in violation of Newton&#x27;s third law of motion from classical physics. His claims generated notoriety because, if true, such a device would have had enormous applications, completely changing human transport, engineering, space travel and more. Dean made several controlled private demonstrations of a number of different devices; however, no working models were ever demonstrated publicly or subjected to independent analysis and Dean never presented any rigorous theoretical basis for their operation. Analysts conclude that the motion seen in Dean&#x27;s device demonstrations was likely reliant on asymmetrical frictional resistance between the device and the surface on which the device was set (&quot;stick and slip&quot;), resulting in the device moving in one direction when in operation, driven by the vibrations of the apparatus.

==Early publicity==
The Dean drive obtained a good deal of publicity in the 1950s and &#x27;60s via the columns and conference presentations of John W. Campbell, the longtime editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine. At that time, Campbell believed that his magazine had to change society by helping breakthrough research that was rejected by &quot;mainstream&quot; science, and he promoted a series of far-reaching ideas that had dubious scientific bases, like Dianetics, dowsing, the Hieronymus machine, and the Dean Drive. Campbell believed that the device worked and claimed to have witnessed it operating on a bathroom scale. The weight reading on the scale appeared to decrease when the device was activated. He subsequently published photographs of the scale with the drive stopped and running. The June 1960 cover of &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine featured a painting of a United States submarine near Mars, supposedly propelled there by a Dean drive.

Dean, who was trying to find potential buyers for his technology, was secretive about the details of how it was supposed to work, but it was said to contain asymmetrical rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration.

Dean and Campbell claimed that Newton&#x27;s laws of motion were only an approximation, and that Dean had discovered a fourth law of motion. This has been described as a nonlinear correction to one of Newton&#x27;s laws, which, if correct, would allegedly have rendered a reactionless drive feasible after all.

One result of the initial articles in Campbell&#x27;s magazine was that two other researchers, William O. Davis and G. Harry Stine, visited Dean and witnessed a demonstration. Results of this visit were published in the May 1962 and June 1976 issues of the magazine, the name of which had been changed by Campbell from &quot;Astounding&quot; to &quot;Analog&quot;. Davis witnessed a demonstration by Dean, and wrote: &quot;It was the conclusion of both Harry Stine and myself that we had witnessed a real anomaly and that the possibility of fraud in the demonstration was slim.&quot; Aerospace researcher Jerry Pournelle—who, like Stine, was a science fiction writer—pointed out that Stine was well qualified to make a judgment on the device, but that he was more gullible than other persons.

Davis&#x27;s 1962 article was titled, &quot;The Fourth Law of Motion&quot;, and described a hypothesis in which Dean&#x27;s device (and others) could conserve momentum invisibly via &quot;gravitational-inertial radiation&quot;. One detail of Davis&#x27;s hypothesis involved the forces of action and reaction—physical bodies can respond to those forces nonsimultaneously, or &quot;out of phase&quot; with each other.

&quot;Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives&quot;, a 1976 article by Davis, reported his tests with Stine, an engineer who built devices to test that aspect of the hypothesis. Stine said they were able to reliably create and reproduce a 3-degree phase angle in a linear system, which was not possible according to ordinary physics. But then they failed to reproduce the effect in a pendulum system, using a rocket-powered ballistic pendulum. The pendulum test would have proved beyond doubt that the Drive worked, but Dean refused to subject the original Dean Drive to a pendulum test. Campbell reported that he had seen the Drive subjected to a pendulum test, but Davis and Stine suspect that he only reported what Dean had told him and had never seen the actual test. Davis says the question can&#x27;t be settled until the pendulum test is made. Their research was terminated in 1965 when the national economy took a downturn, and was never resumed. The 1976 article was an attempt to get research restarted, but apparently failed.

In 1984, physicist Amit Goswami wrote that &quot;Dean&#x27;s machine made such a splash with readers of science fiction that it is now customary in SF circles to refer to a reactionless drive as a Dean drive.&quot;

=== Purported weight loss ===
Dean made a demonstration for a representative of the magazine &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; of one of his &quot;Dean drive&quot; devices. The witness reported that &quot;While suspended above the ground, was able to pull a load to itself without itself being pulled toward the load&quot;. Another version of the machine was reported to be &quot;able to apply a force to a hand, without moving—yet when the machine was turned off an equivalent force applied by the hand easily moved the machine&quot;. William O. Davis, who witnessed the latter demonstration, wrote in his notebook about Dean&#x27;s explanation of how the device worked, &quot;... does not strike me as valid ... For this reason I have decided to undertake a theoretical study of dynamic systems to see if a concept can be evolved which will describe a world in which Dean&#x27;s Drive can exist and yet where other known facts are not contradicted.&quot; Davis produced a hypothesis and it was published in &quot;Analog&quot; in 1962.

Later analysis has revealed that the interactions of vibration, friction, and resonance with the springs of the scale are likely the root cause of the apparent weight loss reported by Campbell and others of apparent &quot;anti-gravity&quot; and &quot;reactionless thruster&quot; effects. 

In the 1950s Jerry Pournelle, working for an aerospace company, contacted Dean to investigate purchasing the device. Dean refused to demonstrate the device without pre-payment and promise of a Nobel Prize. Pournelle&#x27;s company were unwilling to pay for the right to examine the device and never saw the purported model. 3M sent representatives about the same time, and obtained similar results. Pournelle eventually was convinced that Dean&#x27;s device never worked.

==Patents==
Dean was granted two U.S. patents on mechanical devices presumably related to his Dean drive claims. His first patent for a &quot;System for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion&quot; was granted on May 9, 1959. Another patent for a &quot;Variable oscillator system&quot; was granted on May 11, 1965. These two patent designs were the only ones where Dean revealed the design details with an explanation for operation. However, the details were incomplete, and it is not possible to build a Dean Drive just from the explanations in the patent. Dean&#x27;s patents, as well as patents for many other similar devices, have been analyzed and it has been determined that none can produce net directional thrust in free space or operate without violating Newton&#x27;s Third Law. Dean also demonstrated other mechanical devices that were clearly different from his patent designs but apparently never sought patents for them nor otherwise revealed their design details or theory of operation.

In 1978 physicist Russell Adams wrote an article in &quot;Analog&quot;. Searching in the US patent office he had found at least 50 patents for similar reactionless drives. After studying the mechanisms, he concluded that they all relied on friction against the floor they were placed on, and they would be useless in space, where there isn&#x27;t friction against any surface.

Dean&#x27;s patented devices, and his explanation of how his Drive was supposed to work, were later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton&#x27;s third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis.

==Later developments==
After Dean&#x27;s death, neither the demonstration devices nor any working devices were found among his experiments. The demonstration devices were clearly different from the devices patented by Dean, and no diagrams were ever found for them. Consequently, it is impossible to test Dean&#x27;s reported designs or devices to see if they worked as he claimed.

In 1997 physicist John G. Cramer mentioned the Dean Drive in &quot;Analog&quot; in his column &quot;Alternate View&quot;. He said that the demonstration made to Campbell was faulty, and the drive had turned out to be bogus, like many other claims of antigravity devices.

In 2006 a NASA technical memorandum presented the Dean Drive as the most famous example of an &quot;oscillation thruster&quot; and examined its theoretical basis and feasibility as a space drive. It said that &quot;Regrettably, such devices are not breakthroughs, since they still require a connection to the ground to create net motion. The ground is the reaction mass and the frictional connection to the ground is a necessary component to its operation.&quot; NASA regularly receives proposals of similar devices, and the memo recommended that future reviews of said proposals &quot;should require that submitters meet minimal thresholds of proof before engaging in further correspondence.&quot;

<text>Wen Tong () (1019–1079) was a Northern Song painter born in Sichuan famous for his ink bamboo paintings. He was one of the paragons of &quot;scholar&#x27;s painting&quot; (shi ren hua), which idealised spontaneity and painting without financial reward.

He could hold two brushes in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. One Chinese idiom in relation to him goes &quot;there are whole bamboos in his heart&quot; (胸有成竹), meaning that one has a well-thought-out plan in his mind.

As did many artists of his era, Wen Tong also wrote poetry. As attested in his poems, he had at least one golden-hair monkey (金丝狨) and a number of pet gibbons, whose graceful brachiation he admired. An elegy written by him upon the death of one of his gibbons has been preserved in the collection of his works.

<text>Human zoos, also known as ethnological expositions, were a colonial practice of publicly displaying people, usually in a so-called &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; state. They were most prominent during the 19th and 20th centuries. These displays often emphasized the supposed inferiority of the exhibits&#x27; culture, and implied the superiority of &quot;Western society&quot;, through tropes that depicted marginalized groups as &quot;savage&quot;. They then developed into independent displays emphasizing the exhibits&#x27; inferiority to western culture and providing further justification for their subjugation. Such displays featured in multiple colonial exhibitions and at temporary exhibitions in animal zoos.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;human zoo&quot; was not generally used by contemporaries of the shows, and was popularised by the French researcher Pascal Blanchard. The term has been criticised for denying the agency of the shows&#x27; non-European performers.

== Circuses and freak shows ==

The abstract concept of human displays in zoos has been documented throughout the duration of colonial history. In the Western Hemisphere, one of the earliest-known zoos, that of Moctezuma in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.

During the Renaissance, the Medici developed a large menagerie in the Vatican. In the 16th century, Cardinal Hippolytus Medici had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals. He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans. In 1691, Englishman William Dampier exhibited a tattooed native of Miangas whom he bought when he was in Mindanao. He also intended to exhibit the man&#x27;s mother to earn more profit, but the mother died at sea. The man was named Jeoly, falsely branded as &quot;Prince Giolo&quot; to attract more audience, and was exhibited for three months straight until he died of smallpox in London.
One of the first modern public human exhibitions was P. T. Barnum&#x27;s exhibition of Joice Heth on 25 February 1835 and, subsequently, the Siamese twins Chang and Eng Bunker. These exhibitions were common in freak shows. Another famous example was that of Saartjie Baartman of the Namaqua, often referred to as the Hottentot Venus, who was displayed in London and France until her death in 1815.

During the 1850s, Maximo and Bartola, two microcephalic children from El Salvador, were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians. However, human zoos would become common only in the 1870s in the midst of the New Imperialism period.

From 1936 to 1943, the Canadian province of Ontario displayed five White French Canadian quintuplets, whom the provincial government had removed from their birth family, in a human zoo called Quintland.

== Start of human exhibits ==

In the 1870s, exhibitions of so-called &quot;exotic populations&quot; became popular throughout the western world. Human zoos could be seen in many of Europe&#x27;s largest cities, such as Paris, Hamburg, London, and Milan, as well as American cities such as New York City and Chicago. Carl Hagenbeck, an animal trader, was one of the early proponents of this trend, when in 1874, at the suggestion of Heinrich Leutemann, he decided to exhibit Sami people with the &#x27;Laplander Exhibition&#x27;. What differentiated Hagenbeck&#x27;s exhibit from others, was the fact that he showed these people, with animals and plants, to &quot;re-create&quot;, their &quot;natural environment.&quot; He sold people the feeling of having travelled to these areas by witnessing his exhibits. These exhibits were a massive success, and only became larger and more elaborate. From this point forward human exhibitions would lean towards stereotyping, and projecting western superiority. Greater feeding into the Imperialist narrative, that these people&#x27;s culture merited subjugation. It also promoted scientific racism, where they were classified as more or less &#x27;civilized&#x27; on a scale, from great apes to western Europeans.

Hagenbeck would go on to launch a Nubian Exhibit in 1876, and an Inuit exhibit in 1880. These were also massively successful.

Aside from Hagenbeck, the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation was also a hotspot of ethnological exhibits. Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological exhibits that also presented Nubians and Inuit. That year, the audience of the Jardin d&#x27;acclimatation&#x27; doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the &quot;Jardin zoologique d&#x27;acclimatation&quot;.

These displays were so successful they were incorporated into both the 1878 and the 1889 Parisian World&#x27;s Fair, which presented a &#x27;Negro Village&#x27;. Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction.

In Amsterdam the International Colonial and Export Exhibition had a display of people native to Suriname, in 1883.

In 1886, the Spanish displayed natives of the Philippines in an exhibition, as people whom they &quot;civilized&quot;. This event added flame to the 1896 Philippine revolution. Queen Consort of Spain, Maria Cristina of Austria, afterwards institutionalized the business of human zoos. By 1887, indigenous Igorot people &amp; animals were sent to Madrid and were exhibited in a human zoo at the newly constructed Palacio de Cristal del Retiro.

At both the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition Little Egypt, a bellydancer, was photographed as a catalogued &quot;type&quot; by Charles Dudley Arnold and Harlow Higginbotha.

At the 1895 African Exhibition in The Crystal Palace, around eighty people from Somalia were displayed in an &quot;exotic&quot; setting.

The Brussels International Exposition (1897) in Tervuren featured a &quot;Congolese Village&quot; that displayed African people in ersatz interpretations of native settings.

=== German ethnographs ===
Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as &#x27;educational&#x27; to the general population by the scientific community. Very quickly, the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had &quot;evolved&quot; into a &#x27;superior&#x27;, &#x27;cosmopolitan&#x27; life.

In the late 19th century, German ethnographic museums were seen as an empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and &quot;form their own ideas&quot;.

=== Objectification in human zoos ===
Within the history of human zoos, there are patterns of overt sexual representation of displayed peoples, most frequently women. Such objectification often led to treatment that reflected a lack of privacy and respect, including the dissection and display of bodies after death without consent.

An example of the sexualization of ethnically diverse women in Europe is Saartje Baartman, often referred to as her anglicized name Sarah Bartmann. Bartmann was displayed both when she was alive throughout England and Ireland and after her death in the Musée de l&#x27;Homme. While alive, she participated in a traveling show depicting her as a &quot;savage female&quot; with a large focus on her body. The clothes she was put in were tight and close to her skin color, and spectators were encouraged to &quot;see for themselves&quot; if Bartmann&#x27;s body, particularly her buttocks, were real through &quot;poking and pushing&quot;. Her living display was financially compensated but there is no record of her consenting to be examined and displayed after death.

Dominika Czarnecka theorizes on the relationship between the radicalization and sexualization of black female bodies in her journal article &quot;Black Female Bodies and the &#x27;White&#x27; View.&quot; Czarnecka focuses on ethnographic shows that were prominent in Polish territory in the late 19th century. She argues that an essential part of why these shows were so popular is the display of the black female body. Although the women in the shows were meant to be depicting Amazon warriors, their wardrobe was not similar to amazonian dress, and there are several documentations of comments from spectators about their revealing clothes and their bodies.

Although women were most frequently objectified, there are a few instances of &quot;exotic&quot; men being displayed due to their favorable appearance. Angelo Solimann was brought to Italy as a slave from Central Africa in the 18th century, but ended up gaining a reputation in Viennese society for his fighting skills and vast knowledge about language and history. Upon his death in 1796, this positive association did not prevent his body being &quot;stuffed and exhibited in the Viennese Natural History Museum&quot; for almost a decade.

== Around the turn of the century ==
In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the Cincinnati Zoo invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.

The 1900 World&#x27;s Fair presented the famous diorama living in Madagascar, while the Colonial exhibitions in Marseilles (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The 1931 exhibition in Paris was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled &quot;The Truth on the Colonies&quot;, organized by the Communist Party, attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled Albert Londres and André Gide&#x27;s critiques of forced labour in the colonies. Nomadic Senegalese Villages were also presented.

In 1906, Madison Grant—socialite, eugenicist, amateur anthropologist, and head of the New York Zoological Society—had Congolese pygmy Ota Benga put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside apes and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director William Hornaday placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an orangutan named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him The Missing Link, suggesting that in evolutionary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city&#x27;s clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.

On Monday, 8 September 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd &quot;howling, jeering and yelling.&quot;

=== First organized backlash ===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, although &quot;few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions&quot;, controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. &quot;Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes&quot;, said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. &quot;We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.&quot;

New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: &quot;When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage.&quot;

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot;—considered it &quot;imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to&quot; by the black clergymen.

1903 saw one of the first widespread protests against human zoos, at the &quot;Human Pavilion&quot; of an exposition in Osaka, Japan. The exhibition of Koreans and Okinawans in &quot;primitive&quot; housing incurred protests from the governments of Korea and Okinawa, and a Formosan woman wearing Chinese dress angered a group of Chinese students studying abroad in Tokyo. An Ainu schoolteacher was made to exhibit himself in the zoo to raise money for his schoolhouse, as the Japanese government refused to pay. The fact that the schoolteacher made eloquent speeches and fundraised for his school while wearing traditional dress confused the spectators. An anonymous front-page column in a Japanese magazine condemned these examples and the &quot;Human Pavilion&quot; in total, calling it inhumane to exhibit people as spectacles.

=== St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair ===
In 1904, over 1,100 Filipinos were displayed at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in association with the 1904 Summer Olympics. Following the Spanish-American War, the United States had just acquired new territories such as Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. The organizers of the World&#x27;s Fair held &quot;Anthropology Days&quot; on August 12 and 13. Since the 1889 Paris Exposition, human zoos, as a key feature of world&#x27;s fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats. Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE), including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School, where American Indian boarding school students demonstrated their successful assimilation. The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included &quot;baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand&quot;. According to theorist Susan Brownell, world&#x27;s fairs – with their inclusion of human zoos – and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they &quot;were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity&quot;. Also, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.

While Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program, they were closely associated with each other at the time, and in history—Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the &quot;real&quot; Olympic Games. Additionally, almost all of the 400 athletic events were referred to as &quot;Olympian,&quot; and the opening ceremony was held in May with dignitaries in attendance, though the official Olympic program did not begin until July 1. Also, as previously noted, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.

The exhibitions of the World&#x27;s Fair inspired US military officer Truman Hunt to start his own human zoo of &quot;Head-Hunting Igorrotes&quot; in Brooklyn. Reports of questionable living conditions for its Filipino performers led the US Federal government to investigate Hunt&#x27;s exhibition, and eventually shut it down after Hunt was found guilty of wage theft from the performers.

===United Kingdom and France===
Between 1 May and 31 October 1908 the Scottish National Exhibition, opened by one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s grandsons, Prince Arthur of Connaught, was held in Saughton Park, Edinburgh. One of the attractions was the Senegal Village with its French-speaking Senegalese residents, on show demonstrating their way of life, art and craft while living in beehive huts.

In 1909, the infrastructure of the 1908 Scottish National Exhibition in Edinburgh was used to construct the new Marine Gardens to the coast near Edinburgh at Portobello. A group of Somali men, women and children were shipped over to be part of the exhibition, living in thatched huts.

In 1925, a display at Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester, England, was entitled &quot;Cannibals&quot; and featured black Africans in supposedly native dress.

In 1931, around 100 other New Caledonian Kanaks were put on display at the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation in Paris.

=== Spain ===

Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, several exhibitions of non-Western people were held in Spain, following those held in other areas like the United Kingdom. The first of them was held in 1887 by the Ministry of Overseas, which exhibited a group of between forty and fifty Filipino people (then a Spanish territory) together with local products and plants in the Retiro Park in Madrid. For this exhibition, the Palacio de Cristal del Retiro was built, as well as its pond, which sought to recreate the &quot;natural habitat&quot; of the exposed people. At least four people died during the exhibition. In the following years, private companies organized similar exhibitions in Barcelona and Madrid, including of people who were not from Spanish territories, like the Ashanti or the Inuit. Until 1918, exhibitions of African people were held in the Ronda de la Universitat in Barcelona, which were later taken to other European countries. There are also records of another exhibition in the Ibero-American Exposition of Seville in 1929 and an additional one of Fang people from Equatorial Guinea in Valencia in 1942. Until 1997 the &quot;Negro of Banyoles&quot;, an embalmed African man, was exhibited in the Darder Museum in Girona.

=== United States (1930s) ===
By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the Zoro Garden Nudist Colony at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935–36) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real nudist colony, which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured women wearing cowboy hats, gunbelts and boots, and little else. The Golden Gate fair also featured a &quot;Greenwich Village&quot; show, described in the Official Guide Book as &quot;Model artists&#x27; colony and revue theatre.&quot;

=== Ethnological expositions during Nazi Germany ===
As ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931, there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts, these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party, the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat. Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The Hitler Youth did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers. Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.

Hans Massaquoi in his 1999 book &quot;Destined to Witness&quot; observed a human zoo within the Hamburg zoo Tierpark Hagenbeck during the pre-Nazi Germany period, in which an African family was placed with the animals, openly laughed at, and otherwise treated rudely by the public crowd. And then they turned upon him, a fellow spectator, due to his mixed appearance. The date, according to his book, was approximately 1930.

== Exhibitions after 1940 ==
As part of the Portuguese World Exhibition in 1940, members of a tribe from the Bissagos Islands of Guinea-Bissau were displayed on an island in a lake in the Lisbon Tropical Botanical Garden.

A Congolese village was displayed at the Brussels 1958 World&#x27;s Fair. The Congolese on display were among 598 people—including 273 men, 128 women and 197 children, a total of 183 families. Eight-month-old baby Juste Bonaventure Langa died during Expo 58; he rests in the Tervuren cemetery. In mid-July the Congolese protested the condescending treatment they were receiving from spectators and demanded to be sent home, abruptly ending the exhibit and eliciting some sympathy from European newspapers.
In April 1994, an example of an Ivory Coast village was presented as part of an African safari in Port-Saint-Père, near Nantes, in France, later called Planète Sauvage.

In July 2005, the Augsburg Zoo in Germany hosted an &quot;African village&quot; featuring African crafts and African cultural performances. The event was subject to widespread criticism. Defenders of the event argued that it was not racist since it did not involve exhibiting Africans in a debasing way, as had been done at zoos in the past. Critics argued that presenting African culture in the context of a zoo contributed to exoticizing and stereotyping Africans, thus laying the ground work for racial discrimination, and that solidarity and mutual understanding with African people were not primary aims of the event.

In August 2005, London Zoo displayed four human volunteers wearing fig leaves (and bathing suits) for four days.

In 2007, Adelaide Zoo ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who, as part of a study exercise, had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day, but then returned home by night. The inhabitants took part in several exercises, and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure.

In August 2014, as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, South African theatre-maker Brett Bailey&#x27;s show &quot;Exhibit B&quot; was performed in the Playfair Library Hall, University of Edinburgh; then in September at The Barbican in London. This explored the nature of Human Zoos and raised much controversy both amongst the performers and the audiences.

With a view to tackling the morality of Human Zoo exhibits, 2018 saw the poster exhibition, &quot;Putting People on Display&quot;, tour Glasgow School of Art, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Stirling, the University of St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen. Additional posters were added to a selection from the French ACHAC&#x27;s exhibition, &quot;Human Zoos: the Invention of the Savage&quot;, in relation to the Scottish dimension in hosting such shows.

<doc id="866538" wikidata="Q5460039" url="?curid=866538" title="Flood Control Act of 1944">
<text>The Pick-Sloan Flood Control Act of 1944 (P.L. 78–534), enacted in the 2nd session of the 78th Congress, is U.S. legislation that authorized the construction of numerous dams and modifications to previously existing dams, as well as levees across the United States. Among its various provisions, it established the Southeastern Power Administration and the Southwestern Power Administration, and led to the establishment of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program.

The Pick-Sloan legislation managed the Missouri River with six intents: hydropower, recreation, water supply, navigation, flood control and fish and wildlife. Over 50 dams and lakes have been built due to this legislation, not just on the mainly affected river but also on tributaries and other connected rivers. Nebraska, as an example, has seen more than eight new lakes created due to the damming of the Missouri and tributaries. The Act also recognized the legitimate rights of states, through the Governor, to impact flood control projects. See 33 US section 701-1 which declared it to be the policy of the Congress 

to recognize the interests and rights of the States in determining the development of the watersheds within their borders and likewise their interests and rights in water utilization and control.

The Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on December 22, 1944. It was named for General Lewis A. Pick, head of the Army Corps of Engineers, and W. Glenn Sloan of the Interior Department&#x27;s Bureau of Reclamation.

==Effects==
The Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes lost . The Three Affiliated Tribes, specifically, lost in their Fort Berthold Reservation due to the building of the Garrison Dam. The project caused more than 1,500 Native Americans to relocate from the river bottoms of the Missouri river due to the flooding.

The project has successfully controlled flooding throughout the Missouri River basin, provided water for irrigation and municipalities, generated baseload power throughout the central US.

However, the Missouri River dumped millions of cubic feet of soil into the Mississippi River every year, which, deposited the silt into the gulf and formed a string of barrier islands. When the silt was eliminated, the island-building stopped. Biologists sounded the alarm in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the barrier islands were almost gone, and Louisiana was left unprotected from storm surges and oil spills.

<doc id="866543" wikidata="Q508098" url="?curid=866543" title="Stephen Bray">
<text>Stephen Pate Bray (born December 23, 1956) is an American songwriter, drummer, and record producer. He is best known for his collaborations with Madonna, being a member of the band Breakfast Club, and for winning the 2017 Grammy Award for the Best Musical Theater Album of the Tony Award-winning revival of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. Bray owns and operates Saturn Sound recording studios and the Soultone Records label.

== Career ==
Bray began studying music through private instruction in Detroit, attended Washtenaw Community College in Ann Arbor. He continued his education at Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1978.

=== Collaborations with Madonna ===
Bray dated Madonna before her fame when she was attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for dance in 1976. He moved to New York after receiving a call from Madonna in November 1980; at that time she was a member of the band Breakfast Club in Queens. Madonna wanted to form a new band and invited Bray to play the drums. They formed the band Emmy and the Emmys. They also rekindled their romance and together they moved into The Music Building in Manhattan for a while.

Madonna obtained a recording contract with Gotham Management, managed by Camille Barbone in 1981. Barbone put together a new band with session musicians although Madonna wanted Bray as her drummer. Barbone knew they had been romantically involved and didn&#x27;t want love affairs among band members. The music she was producing with them was more rock oriented but Madonna had her eyes set on dance music. She and Stephen Bray continued working on a parallel project, more club oriented.

After being signed to Sire Records in 1982, Madonna opted not to work with Bray for her debut album, but they continued collaborating with her second album &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984). Together, they wrote and produced some of the biggest hit songs of the 1980s, including several of Madonna&#x27;s biggest hits. The songs Bray and Madonna composed often followed a distinctive structure, many of which repeat the song&#x27;s second verse and bridge before fading out with the chorus. Their partnership concluded with their work on Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989).

===The Breakfast Club===
Following Madonna&#x27;s rise to stardom, Bray rejoined Breakfast Club, and the quartet signed first with ZE Records and later with MCA. The band&#x27;s eponymous first album was released in early 1987, preceded by the Top 10 hit &quot;Right on Track&quot;. Bray co-wrote most of the albums&#x27; songs with bandmate Dan Gilroy, and Bray produced several songs. The band&#x27;s second album was not released, and Breakfast Club broke up shortly afterward.

=== The Color Purple ===
Bray made his Broadway debut in 2005 as composer and lyricist for the Broadway version of Alice Walker&#x27;s book &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. He was nominated for a Tony Award for his work on the show.

==Personal life==
Bray lives in Studio City, California with his wife, movie producer Stephanie Allain, who produced &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; and &quot;Black Snake Moan&quot;. Bray&#x27;s brother is the music video director Kevin Bray.

According to Mary Gabriel&#x27;s book Madonna: A Rebel Life, Stephen Bray dated Madonna in 1977.

<text>Omar Dwight Conger (April 1, 1818July 11, 1898) was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

Conger was born in Cooperstown, New York, son of the Rev. Enoch Conger and Esther (West) Conger. The Conger family moved to Huron County, Ohio, in 1824. He pursued academic studies at the Huron Institute in Milan, Ohio, and graduated from Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University) in Hudson, Ohio, in 1841. He engaged in mineral explorations of the Lake Superior copper and iron regions in connection with the Michigan State Geological Survey 1845–1847. He engaged in the practice of law in Port Huron, Michigan, in 1848 and was elected judge of the St. Clair County Court in 1850. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate 1855–1859, and served as President pro tempore in 1859. He was a member of the State military board during the Civil War, holding the rank of colonel. He was a Presidential Elector for Michigan in 1864 and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1866.

He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives for the 41st United States Congress and to the five succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1869 until March 3, 1881. He represented Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1869 to 1873 and became the first person to represent the 7th district from 1873 to 1881.

Conger was re-elected to the House for the 47th Congress in the general election on November 2, 1880. He was subsequently elected by the Michigan Legislature to the United States Senate on January 18, 1881. Conger served the remainder of his term in the House for 46th Congress and resigned from the House for the next term to serve in the Senate. John T. Rich was elected in a special election April 4, 1881, to fill the vacancy in the House.

While in the House, Conger served as chairman, Committee on Expenditures in the State Department in the 42nd Congress, and the Committee on Patents in the 43rd Congress.

Conger was elected in 1880 as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1881, to March 4, 1887. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1886. He served as chairman, Committee on Manufactures in the 47th Congress, the Committee on the Revision of the Laws in the 48th Congress, and the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads in the 49th Congress.

After leaving Congress, he engaged in the practice of law in Washington, D.C., and died in Ocean City, Maryland. He is interred in Lakeside Cemetery, Port Huron, Michigan.

Conger also played an important role in the establishment of the American Red Cross. On May 12, 1881, Clara Barton, who became the first president of the organization, organized a meeting at Sen. Conger&#x27;s home. The 15 people present at this meeting include Barton, Conger, and Rep. William Lawrence (R, OH).

Senator Conger is the namesake for Fort Conger, the pioneering Arctic outpost established by Augustus Greeley&#x27;s 1881 expedition and named by the explorer, along with Conger Sound, in gratitude for the senator&#x27;s support.

Conger&#x27;s legacy can also be seen in the street names in Port Huron, Michigan. The two streets closest to the lake are named Omar Street and Conger Avenue, and are just a few blocks away from Lakeside Cemetery where he is interred. Additionally, there was a short-lived settlement established in the Thumb called &quot;Omard&quot;, which was named in honor of the senator using his first name &quot;Omar&quot; and his middle initial &quot;D&quot;.

The Library of Congress lists a single published work by Conger in its catalog. This is the 15 page pamphlet titled &quot;A Plain Review&quot;, published in Washington, D.C., in 1892. Its subject is French spoliation claims. The call number there is E321 .C74.

His grandson was also named Omar Dwight Conger and graduated from Harvard University before being killed in San Diego during World War II.

<text>The Pick–Sloan Missouri Basin Program, formerly called the Missouri River Basin Project, was initially authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944, which approved the plan for the conservation, control, and use of water resources in the Missouri River Basin.

The intended beneficial uses of these water resources include flood control, aids to navigation, irrigation, supplemental water supply, power generation, municipal and industrial water supplies, stream-pollution abatement, sediment control, preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife, and creation of recreation opportunities.

The construction of dams such as the Oahe, Garrison, and Fort Randall flooded out significant parts of many Native American reservations, including those at Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Fort Berthold, Crow Creek, and Lower Brule. One source called the program the single most destructive act ever perpetrated on any tribe by the United States.

It derives its name from the authors of the program–Lewis A. Pick, director of the Missouri River office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and William Glenn Sloan, director of the Billings, Montana office of the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

==History==

===The Pick plan===
In May 1943, the House Flood Control Committee chose the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create a solution for extreme flooding in the Missouri Basin. Lewis A. Pick developed a proposal for the corps called the Pick plan, which was finished in August of the same year.

The Pick plan introduced three different projects to be carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers. The first undertaking involved the construction of 1,500 miles of levees from Sioux City to the Mississippi River to protect from Missouri River flooding. The second proposal called for the construction of eighteen dams on Missouri&#x27;s tributaries. Eleven of those dams had been previously approved by Congress. Five dams were planned to be located on tributaries of the Republican River in the lower basin. Of the remaining dams, the Pick plan recommended construction of one on the Bighorn River in Wyoming and another on Montana&#x27;s Yellowstone River. The Pick plan&#x27;s third project was the creation of five multi-purpose dams on the Missouri River. Initially, the plan&#x27;s total cost was estimated to be $490 million.

The original Pick plan was supported by the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the Mississippi Valley Association, the Propeller Club of the United States, the American Merchant Marine Conference, the Mississippi Valley Flood Control Association, and other lower-basin residents. Senators Joseph O&#x27;Mahoney (D-WY) and Eugene Millikin (R-CO) offered amendments to the plan that would also provide for the interests of people in the upper basin. The amendments created an emphasis on irrigation over river navigation and gave precedence to arid states for the use of basin water. O&#x27;Mahoney and Millikin&#x27;s amendments also called for Congress to inform any states associated with proposed watershed development. The amendments were later added to the Pick plan.

===The Sloan plan===
The Sloan plan was developed by William G. Sloan, the assistant director at the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s regional office who had previously worked for the Corps of Engineers. The plan was submitted on May 4, 1944, to Congress.

In contrast to the Pick Plan, Sloan&#x27;s strategy was more intricate. His 211-page program involved plans for ninety irrigation and power development projects. It was proposed with a budget of $1.26 billion. The Sloan plan pushed for reservoir storage in upper tributaries of the Missouri River located in smaller dams, which would provide irrigation for 4.8 million acres in areas where the land suffered from drought. The Sloan plan allotted 1.3 million acres of irrigated land in North Dakota. South Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska were allotted about 1 million acres each.

The plan picked up support from the National Reclamation Association and the National Grange.

===The Omaha Conference===
On October 17, 1944, the Omaha Conference was scheduled for the consolidation of the Pick and Sloan plans. In total, the plans had proposed 113 different projects. Once the plans were merged, 107 of those projects remained. The combined Pick-Sloan plan allowed the Corps of Engineers jurisdiction over flood control, navigation projects and five main-stem dams. The Bureau of Reclamation was granted permission to build 27 dams in the Yellowstone Basin. In addition, the Corps of Engineers and the Reclamation Bureau were both given authority to develop hydroelectric power on the Missouri River.

The newly merged Pick Sloan plan was accepted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. It was officially titled as the Missouri River Basin Development Program and was presented in conjunction with the Flood Control Act of 1944. President Roosevelt authorized $200 million for the program. In its entirety, the Pick-Sloan plan arranged for 107 dams, 1,500 miles of protective levees, 4.7 million acres of irrigation systems, and 1.6 million kilowatts of electric power.

===Early critics===
Many early critics of the Pick-Sloan plan were in favor of creating a Missouri Valley Authority (MVA). They claimed that the MVA would provide a more unified solution to water development on the Missouri River than the merged ideas of opposing bureaucracies. Ideas for the MVA were influenced by the success of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Senator James E. Murray of Montana and Congressman John J. Cochran from Missouri developed bills for the Missouri Valley Authority. The MVA bills planned to navigate Missouri into a number of stairstep lakes linked together by locks. They would also arrange for giant reservoirs to supply irrigation and cheap hydroelectricity power, arguing that this would produce more public power and leave less condemned private land. The bills were presented in the 79th Congress, but they were later brought down.

==Interventions==
Several water-control measures were introduced through the Pick–Sloan legislation that variously affected the Missouri River Valley and its environs.

The Pick–Sloan program dams built between 1946 and 1966 are:
* Canyon Ferry Dam and Lake in Montana
* Garrison Dam and Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota
* Oahe Dam and Lake Oahe in South Dakota
* Big Bend Dam and Lake Sharpe in South Dakota
* Fort Randall Dam and Lake Francis Case in South Dakota
* Gavins Point Dam and Lewis and Clark Lake in South Dakota and Nebraska

Based on Pick–Sloan legislation, the &quot;Reclamation Project Authorization Act&quot; of October 20, 1972 authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to build additional dams at the North Loup River and Middle Loup River in Nebraska: Six dams were constructed between 1976 and 1994: 
* Davis Creek Dam 
* Virginia Smith Dam and Calamus Lake (formlery Calamus Dam and Reservoir) at the Calamus River
* Kent Diversion Dam
* Sherman Dam and Reservoir
* Milburn Diversion Dam 
* Arcadia Diversion Dam

Other dams along the Missouri River that were not part of the Sloan–Pick program are Toston Dam (1940), Hauser Dam (1907), Holter Dam (1908), Black Eagle Dam (1927), Rainbow Dam (1912), Cochrane Dam (1958), Ryan Dam (1915), Morony Dam (1930) and Fort Peck Dam (1940), all located in Montana.

== Native American relocation ==
Over on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota were flooded by the Oahe Dam, forcing Native Americans to relocate from flooded areas. The Fort Randall Dam flooded of Indigenous land and were inundated by the Big Bend Dam. In South Dakota, politicians and other proponents of the Pick-Sloan Program and dam construction had promised of irrigation as “appropriate compensation” for lost land. As of 2016, poverty remains a problem for the displaced populations in the Dakotas, who are still seeking compensation for the loss of the towns submerged under Lake Oahe, and the loss of their traditional ways of life.

The construction of main-stream dams also affected other Native American tribes living along the Missouri River on the Fort Berthold, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, Crow Creek, and Lower Brule Indian reservations. The Garrison, Oahe, and Fort Randall dams created a reservoir that eliminated 90 percent of timber and 75 percent of wildlife on the reservations.

According to Native American historian Vine Deloria Jr., the &quot;Pick–Sloan plan was, without doubt, the single most destructive act ever perpetrated on any tribe by the United States.&quot;

<text>Tommie Lee Agee (August 9, 1942 – January 22, 2001) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from through , most notably as a member of the New York Mets team that became known as the Miracle Mets when, they rose from being perennial losers to defeat the favored Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series for one of the most improbable upsets in World Series history. Agee performed two impressive defensive plays in center field to help preserve a Mets victory in the third game of the series.

A two-time Major League All-Star player, Agee was also a two-time Gold Glove Award winner and, was named the AL Rookie of the Year in 1966 as a member of the Chicago White Sox. He also played for the Cleveland Indians, Houston Astros and the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2002, Agee was posthumously inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Agee was born in Magnolia, Alabama, and played baseball and football at Mobile County Training School with future New York Mets teammate Cleon Jones. After one season at Grambling State University (), Agee signed with the Cleveland Indians for a $60,000 bonus.

==Career==
===Cleveland Indians===
After two seasons in the Indians&#x27; farm system with the AAA Portland Beavers, Agee received a September call-up to Cleveland in . With the Indians already behind 11-1 to the Minnesota Twins, Agee made his major league debut on September 14 at Metropolitan Stadium pinch-hitting for pitcher Bill Dailey in the ninth inning. He received September call-ups to the majors the following two seasons as well, playing a total of 31 games with the Indians in which he batted .170 with one home run and five runs batted in. Following the season, he was dealt to the Chicago White Sox with Tommy John as part of a three team blockbuster trade between the Indians, White Sox and Kansas City Athletics that returned All-Star Rocky Colavito to the Indians.

===Chicago White Sox===
Agee batted just .226 with the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Indianapolis Indians, and .158 in ten games with the White Sox in . After earning the starting center fielder job in spring training , he hit a two-run home run in the season opener, and was batting .264 with nine home runs and 38 RBIs to be named the White Sox&#x27;s sole representative at the 1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .273 batting average, 22 home runs, 86 RBIs and 44 stolen bases, becoming the first player in Major League Baseball history with more than 20 home runs and 40 stolen bases in their rookie season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll continues ROY chase as 4th rookie of 20/40 club&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by Mitchell Page (), Mike Trout () and Corbin Carroll () as the only four rookies to accomplish the feat. His performance earned him the American League Rookie of the Year award, while his defense in center field earned him a Gold Glove. Although he was technically in his 5th major league season, MLB&#x27;s classification of a rookie is determined by plate appearances and time on a major league roster. Agee&#x27;s September call-ups had been so brief and his playing time so scarce that he was still eligible for the award.

Agee was batting .247 with ten home runs and 35 RBIs to earn his second consecutive All-Star selection in . His production fell off considerably in the second half of the season (he hit only four home runs after the All-Star break), and ended the season batting .234 with 52 RBIs. Though they finished the season in fourth place, Chicago finished only three games back of the first place Boston Red Sox, and battled Boston, the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins until the final week of the season. On a team loaded with pitching and short on offense (no regular batted over .241), the team&#x27;s lack of offense possibly cost the White Sox the American League pennant.

To alleviate this problem, the White Sox imported perennial .300 hitter Tommy Davis, along with pitcher Jack Fisher and two minor leaguers, from the New York Mets for Agee and Al Weis.

===New York Mets===

Agee was hit in the head by Bob Gibson on the very first pitch thrown to a Mets batter in spring training . At the beginning of the regular season, he went 0-for-10 in a 24-inning affair with the Houston Astros that saw his batting average go from .313 to .192. It led to an 0-for-34 slump that brought his average down to .102. For the season, he batted .217 with five home runs and 17 RBIs.

====1969 season====
Agee got his first career multi-home run game in the third game of the season, against the Montreal Expos, one of which went halfway up in section 48 of the left field upper deck at Shea Stadium, a feat that was never matched. Expos right fielder Mack Jones said the ball was still rising when it came into contact with the stands. To commemorate the home run, there was a painted sign in that section of the stadium with Agee&#x27;s name and uniform number and the date. He also had his first four-hit game on May 2 (four for four with a walk and a home run).

By May 21, Agee was batting over .300, and the Mets won their third game in a row for a .500 winning percentage 36 games into the season for the first time in franchise history. This was followed by a five-game losing streak that saw the Mets fall into fourth place in the newly aligned National League East.

The Mets then went on an 11-game winning streak that included a two-home run, four-hit performance by Agee against the San Francisco Giants in the final game of the streak. By this point, the Mets were in second place, seven games back of the Chicago Cubs.

The Mets were two and a-half games back on September 8 when the Cubs came to Shea to open a crucial two game series with the Mets. Cubs starter Bill Hands knocked down the first batter he faced, Agee, who had been moved into the lead-off spot in the line-up, in the bottom half of the first inning. Jerry Koosman hit the next Cubs batter he faced, Ron Santo, in the hand, breaking it. Agee himself retaliated by hitting a two-run home run in the third, and scored the winning run of the game on a Wayne Garrett single in the sixth inning.

The Mets swept the Expos in a double header on September 10. Coupled with a Cubs loss, the Mets moved into first place for the first time ever during the 1969 season. The Mets would not relinquish their lead from this point. On September 24, the New York Mets clinched the NL East as Donn Clendenon hit two home runs in a 6-0 Mets win over Steve Carlton and the St. Louis Cardinals (who struck out a record 19 Mets nine days earlier in a losing effort). For the season, Agee batted .271 while leading his team with 26 home runs, 97 runs scored and 76 RBIs. Along with Cy Young Award winner Tom Seaver and Cleon Jones, he was one of three Mets to finish in the top ten in NL MVP Award balloting, being also named the &quot;Sporting News&quot; NL Comeback Player of the Year.

====1969 World Series====
Agee batted .357 with two home runs and four RBIs in the Mets&#x27; three-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves in the 1969 National League Championship Series. The Mets were heavy underdogs heading into the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. In Game 3 (the first World Series home game in Mets history), with the series tied 1–1, Agee had what &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called the greatest single performance by a center fielder in World Series history. In the first inning, Agee hit a leadoff home run off Jim Palmer for what would eventually be the game-winning hit and RBI, as the Mets shut out the Orioles, 5–0. In the same game, Agee also made two catches that potentially saved five runs. The first catch came in the fourth inning with Gary Gentry pitching and two outs and runners on first and third. Agee, playing the left-handed hitting Elrod Hendricks to pull, made a backhanded catch near the base of the wall in left centerfield. The second catch came in the seventh inning with Nolan Ryan relieving Gentry; the bases were loaded with two outs, and Agee made a headfirst dive in right centerfield on a ball hit by Paul Blair.

====1970–72====
Agee began the season by going on a 20-game hitting streak from April 16 to May 9. He enjoyed one of the finest games of his career on June 12, when he went four for five with two home runs and four runs scored, and he would go on to be named NL Player of the Month for June with a .364 batting average, 11 home runs, and 30 RBI. He also hit for the cycle on July 6. Agee displayed his spectacular and daring base running in the 10th inning in the NY Mets 2-1 win over the LA Dodgers when he stole second, took third on a wild pitch and surprised every one when he stole home for the victory! For the season, Agee batted .286, and established a Mets season record for hits with 182, runs with 107, and stolen bases with 31. He also won his second Gold Glove award, making him the first African-American to win a Gold Glove in both leagues.

Chronic knee injuries hampered Agee in and , though he still batted .285 and tied for the Mets lead with 14 home runs in 1971. In 1972, he finished second on the Mets with 47 RBIs despite batting only .227.

===Later career===
Agee was traded from the Mets to the Houston Astros for Rich Chiles and Buddy Harris at the Winter Meetings on November 27, 1972. He faced the Mets for the first time in his career on April 24, and went two for three with a walk and a run scored in the Astros&#x27; 4-2 victory. He was batting .235 with eight home runs and 15 RBIs when the Astros dealt him to the St. Louis Cardinals on August 18, who were in a battle with the Mets and Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL East.

He was dealt from the Cardinals to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Pete Richert at the Winter Meetings on December 5, 1973. He was released during spring training. Though he never made a regular season appearance with the Dodgers, his final baseball card was #630T in the 1974 Topps Traded series, which depicted him as a Dodger.

===Career statistics===
==Retirement==
After retirement, he operated the Outfielder&#x27;s Lounge near Shea Stadium. Agee was also known as the most active former Met, taking part in many charitable events and children&#x27;s baseball clinics around both the New York area and Mobile. He appeared as himself in a episode of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; along with several other members of the 1969 Mets.

Tommie visited Shea Stadium often and appeared at old timers games and card shows. He was later inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Agee met his wife Maxcine at a nightclub and restaurant he ran. The couple had a daughter, Jnelle.

Agee suffered a heart attack while leaving a Midtown Manhattan office building on January 22, 2001, and died later that day at Bellevue Hospital Center, aged 58. He was buried in Pine Crest Cemetery in Mobile, Alabama.

==Legacy==
Agee was posthumously inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in .

Agee was also posthumously inducted into the New York State Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022.

<doc id="866565" wikidata="Q659283" url="?curid=866565" title="Alewife (fish)">
<text>The alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus; : alewives) is an anadromous species of herring found in North America. It is one of the &quot;typical&quot; North American shads, attributed to the subgenus &quot;Pomolobus&quot; of the genus &quot;Alosa&quot;. As an adult it is a marine species found in the northern West Atlantic Ocean, moving into estuaries before swimming upstream to breed in freshwater habitats, but some populations live entirely in fresh water. It is best known for its invasion of the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls. Here, its population surged, peaking between the 1950s and 1980s to the detriment of many native species of fish. In an effort to control it biologically, Pacific salmon were introduced, only partially successfully. As a marine fish, the alewife is a US National Marine Fisheries Service &quot;Species of Concern&quot;.

==Description==
Alewife reach a maximum standard length (SL) of about , but have a typical SL of about . The front of the body is deep and larger than other fish found in the same waters.

Alewife have bronze-colored heads and a grey-blue to greyish green dorsum. A humeral spot is often present. The tongue does not bear teeth. The peritoneum is light-colored with spots to dusky-appearing, an internal feature that distinguishes alewife from blueback herring (&quot;Alosa aestivalis&quot;), which have a dark peritoneum. The otolith is shaped like a letter &quot;L&quot;, unlike its hooked shape in &quot;A. aestivalis&quot;. Additionally, the eye is larger than that of &quot;A. aestivalis&quot;; the width of the eye often exceeds the length of the snout in &quot;A. pseudoharengus&quot;.

==Etymology and folklore==
Its common name is said to come from comparison with a corpulent female tavernkeeper (&quot;ale-wife&quot;), or, alternatively, from the word &quot;aloofe&quot;, possibly of Native American origin, that was used to describe this fish in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In southwestern Nova Scotia, alewife are referred to as kiacks (or kyacks). In Atlantic Canada it is known as the gaspereau, from the Acadian French word &quot;gasparot&quot;, first mentioned by Nicolas Denys. William Francis Ganong, New Brunswick biologist and historian, wrote:

Gaspereau, or Gasparot. Name of a common salt-water fish of Acadia
(also called alewife), first used, so far as I can find, by Denys in
1672. Nowhere can I find any clue to its origin. It seems not to be
Indian.
Acadians named three rivers after the fish, the Gaspereau River in Nova Scotia, as well as the Gaspereau River near Grand Lake and Gaspereau River near Northumberland Strait that are both in New Brunswick.

Both anadromous and landlocked forms occur. The landlocked form is also called a sawbelly or mooneye (although this latter name is more commonly applied to &quot;Hiodon&quot; spp.) Adult alewife are caught during their spring spawning migration upstream by being scooped out of shallow, constricted areas using large dip nets. They are the preferred bait for the spring lobster fishery in Maine, and are eaten by humans, usually smoked.

==In the North American Great Lakes==

Alewife are known for their invasion of the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls. Although the United States Department of Agriculture suggests they may be native to Lake Ontario, alewife colonized the other Great Lakes and became abundant mostly in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. It appears that they had spread from Lake Erie to other Great Lakes by the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. They reached their peak abundance from the 1950s through the 1980s. Alewife grew in number unchecked because the lakes lacked a top predator (lake trout were essentially wiped out around the same time by overfishing and the invasion of the sea lamprey)

For a time, alewife, which often exhibit seasonal die-offs, washed up in windrows on the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Various species of Pacific salmon (first coho, and later the Chinook salmon) were introduced as predators. Though marginally successful, this led to the development of a salmon/alewife fishery popular with many sport anglers.

In spite of such biological control methods, alewife remain implicated in the decline of many native Great Lakes species. It is also a common predator of numerous native and non-native zooplankton taxa (e.g. &quot;Bythotrephes longimanus&quot;, &quot;Leptodiaptomus ashlandi&quot;, &quot;Limnocalanus&quot; spp., &quot;Leptodiaptomus minutus&quot;, &quot;Leptodiaptomus sicilis&quot;, and &quot;Leptodora kindtii&quot;). Wells (1970) found that increases in population of alewife in the Great Lakes between 1954 and 1966 were associated with population declines in certain larger species of zooplankton, while an alewife die-off in 1967 was temporally related to population rebound in most of those species.

==Conservation==

Alewife populations have seen big declines throughout much of their range. Several threats have most likely contributed to their decline, including loss of habitat due to decreased access to spawning areas from the construction of dams and other impediments to migration, habitat degradation, fishing, and increased predation due to recovering striped bass populations.

In response to the declining population trend for alewives, the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia, and North Carolina have instituted moratoria on taking and possession.

In eastern Massachusetts, Alewife Brook flows through Arlington, Cambridge, and Somerville to the Mystic River. The brook gives its name to the Alewife Brook Parkway and the Alewife Brook Reservation. The Red Line (MBTA) of Boston&#x27;s T ends at the Alewife station, so the name of this fish adorns the front of every northbound Red Line train. An extensive habitat restoration and education project, combined with a fish ladder with monitoring cameras, is yielding increasing numbers of alewife back in the improving Mystic River watershed.

The alewife is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern, about which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the US Endangered Species Act.

<doc id="866575" wikidata="Q958683" url="?curid=866575" title="Nick Kamen">
<text>Ivor Neville &quot;Nick&quot; Kamen (15 April 1962 – 4 May 2021) was a British singer, songwriter and model of mixed Burmese, Irish, Dutch and French descent. He was best known for the singles &quot;Each Time You Break My Heart&quot; from 1986 and &quot;I Promised Myself&quot; from 1990, as well as for appearing in a 1985 Levi&#x27;s advert.

== Early life ==
Kamen was born in Harlow, Essex, England, where he attended St Marks RC Comprehensive School. He was the seventh of eight children, with four sisters and three brothers, Ronald Kamen, Chester Kamen and Barry Kamen.

== Career ==
In 1982, Kamen appeared in the video for &quot;The Damned Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; by synthpop band Visage. He first came to the public&#x27;s attention in 1984 when Ray Petri featured him on the front cover of &quot;The Face&quot;. The cover showed him wearing a ski-hat, lipstick, orange roll-neck sweater and aviator sunglasses.

He is widely known in the UK for his role in the 1985 Levi&#x27;s &quot;Launderette&quot; commercial, where he stripped to his boxer shorts in a 1950s-style launderette while he waited for his blue jeans to wash, one of a series of Bartle Bogle Hegarty advertisements that increased sales of Levi 501s. The commercial ranked sixth in &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; in 2000.

Kamen&#x27;s musical success was mainly in Europe. His first single was the 1986 UK Number 5 hit &quot;Each Time You Break My Heart” from his eponymous début album. The song was written and produced by Madonna and frequent Madonna collaborator, Stephen Bray, with Madonna also singing background vocals. Her original demo remains one of many unreleased Madonna songs by the artist herself. Kamen also had a Number 16 follow-up in the UK with his second single, &quot;Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever&quot; (a cover of the Four Tops&#x27; 1966 hit), although his later singles were less commercially successful in the UK but more so in the rest of Europe, particularly Italy, France, Germany, and Spain.

His second album &quot;Us&quot; (1988) was produced by another Madonna frequent collaborator, Patrick Leonard. Madonna again made an appearance with background vocals on the song &quot;Tell Me&quot;, this time without contributing to the songwriting or production. The song was a hit in Italy in the summer of 1988, spending nine weeks at Number 1. Later in 1988 a WEA Italiana compilation &quot;Loving You,&quot; containing mainly extended versions of previous singles, reached number 7 on the Italian album charts. In 1989, Kamen performed the song &quot;Turn It Up&quot; on the soundtrack to the Disney film &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;.

Kamen&#x27;s third album &quot;Move Until We Fly&quot; was released in 1990 and contained another big European hit, the single &quot;I Promised Myself&quot;. The song reached the top ten in several European countries and was the fourth most played record in Europe in 1990. The song was later covered by Dead or Alive (1999), A-Teens (2004), Basshunter (2009), and by German punk rockers Maggers United (2013).

His 1988 European single &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot; has a Cantonese cover version sung by 張立基 (Norman Cheung) which titled &quot;今夜你是否人 (Are You Alone?)&quot; reached Number 1 on the airplay chart in Hong Kong in 1989.

Kamen appeared on UK television, singing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (27 November 1986 and 12 March 1987), &quot;This Morning&quot; (9 April 1990), &quot;Night Network&quot; (15 April 1987, 19 August 1987 and 1988) and &quot;The Tube&quot; (31 October 1986 and 21 November 1986). On his first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, he was introduced by Gary Davies and sang &quot;Each Time You Break My Heart” and on his second appearance, he was introduced by Steve Wright and sang &quot;Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever”. On both occasions, his brother Chester Kamen was on guitar.

In 1992, Kamen released his final album, titled &quot;Whatever, Whenever&quot;.

Cherry Red Records released his debut album as a two-disc deluxe edition in 2015, followed by the six CD box set &quot;The Complete Collection&quot; in 2020.

== Death ==
Kamen died at his London home on 4 May 2021, aged 59, following three years with bone marrow cancer. He had been receiving treatment at Hammersmith Hospital, West London.

<text>Tongji University is a public university located in Shanghai, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Established in 1907 by German physicians in Shanghai, the university now has a faculty of more than 2,815 scholars, including 27 members from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Currently, Tongji University owns 29 colleges, 11 affiliated hospitals, and 7 affiliated primary and secondary schools.

==History==

The history of Tongji University can be traced back to 1907 when the German Medical School for the Chinese () in Shanghai was founded by the German government together with the German physicians Erich Paulun, Oscar von Schab and Paul Krieg. The school was affiliated with the Tongji-Hospital the German physicians had established in Shanghai on the initiative of Paulun. The name Tongji, which is a phonetic approximation in Shanghainese of German &quot;deutsche&quot; (&quot;German&quot;), suggests cooperating by riding the same boat. The school was expanded to include engineering in its programs and got its new name as German Medical and Engineering School for the Chinese in Shanghai in 1912. It was formally established as a Chinese university under the name of Tongji University in 1923/1924 and was renamed as National Tongji University in 1927. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), the university campus was moved from Shanghai first to Zhejiang Province, then to Jiangxi Province and Yunnan Province and later to Sichuan Province. It was eventually moved back to Shanghai in 1946.

Tongji became one of the first universities authorized by the State Council to establish a graduate school. It became a member of the Project 211, which provided universities with substantial government fund. In 1995, the university became one to be jointly supported by the State Education Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government. In 1996 the university merged with Shanghai Institute of Urban Construction and Shanghai Institute of Building Materials. The merger was acknowledged by the State Council as &quot;Tongji Model&quot; in the system renovation of higher institutions in China. In April 2000, the expanded Tongji merged again with Shanghai Railway University. The university is now a comprehensive university which offers a wide range of programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, law, economics and management.

<text>HBO Films (formerly called HBO Premiere Films and HBO Pictures) is an American production and distribution company, a division of the cable television network HBO that produces feature films and miniseries. The division produces fiction and non-fiction works under HBO Documentary Films, primarily for distribution to their own customers, though recently the company has been funding theatrical releases.

HBO Films slates three or four films per year and develops most of them internally with theatrical films being distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.

==Background==
After or around 1978, HBO was involved into preproduction financing films for exclusive pay-TV rights, which was risky as the films could be unpopular while alienating movie studios. The original Silver Screen Partners, L.P. was organized by Roland W. Betts, New York film investment broker to fund movies for HBO in 1982. The limited partnership sold through EF Hutton were oversubscribed and raised $83 million. HBO made a 50% guarantee on their investment for exclusive cable rights. HBO then joined with Columbia Pictures and CBS to form TriStar Pictures, which was expected to become a major film studio, in 1983. HBO sold half of its ownership in TriStar in December 1985.

==History==
===Origin, as a television film production arm===
HBO Premiere Films began in 1983 as a telefilm and miniseries production company with an &quot;ambitious production schedule&quot; for the HBO channel. With the high expense of theatrical film exclusive, those films appeared on multiple pay TV channels. Thus, the unit was started to give the channel some exclusives. The company&#x27;s first head, Jane Deknatel (an English-born television veteran), projected the unit would do 24 projects in 1984 and 50 a few years later. HBO Premiere Films was funding the productions at 60% for just the pay TV rights. Their first film, &quot;The Terry Fox Story&quot;, shown in May 1983 was also the first feature film produced expressly for pay television. Two more films were produced and shown in 1983.

By the end of the first year the schedule was cut back and the unit moved into producing theatrical films. In January 1984, Donald March took over the company from Deknatel as senior vice president. He canceled a dozen projects in development and was reassessing star vehicle productions as being done as vanity projects. A production for each month from July to November was the new plan with a push for additional rights beyond pay TV rights, like foreign theatrical, home video and network television. In January 1984, a telefilm and HBO Premiere Films&#x27; first two mini-series, &quot;All the Rivers Run&quot; then &quot;Far Pavilions&quot; were cablecast. HBO Pictures started winning Emmy Awards in 1993 with two for &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; and &quot;Stalin&quot;.

Around the time, the company tried its hand into feature films again by partnering with Cinema Plus L.P., with MGM/UA Communications planning on to distribute its films, but the films that eventually came out were released by Warner Bros. due to the Time-Warner merger.

Around November 1996, John Matoian was appointed as president of HBO Pictures reporting to HBO chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes. Bewkes decided by April 1999 that he want a single original programming division. Programming president Chris Albrecht oversaw original series development, specials and miniseries and was selected over Matoian. Matoian resigned because he lost his direct reporting status and would have reported to Albrecht. Executive vice president of HBO NYC Colin Callender, who reported to Matoian, was promoted to take over as president of HBO Pictures.

===HBO Films===
In October 1999, HBO NYC Productions was merged into HBO Pictures and renamed HBO Films under division president Callender. HBO Films Development Unit was also formed by November 1999.
Prior to July 2003, HBO Films made individual distribution deal for their films. The company formed its theatrical distribution division, HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing, that month with a distribution label partnership pact with Fine Line Features and the hiring of Dennis O’Connor, United Artists marketing vice-president, as division head. The pact negotiation was started due to a single distribution film deal between Fine Line and HBO Films for &quot;American Splendor&quot;. HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing&#x27;s first release was &quot;Elephant&quot; on October 24, 2003. In 2005, HBO Films Domestic Theatrical Releasing and Fine Line were effectively merged with Warner Bros. (WB) decided HBO and New Line Cinema should form a new smaller and niche films distribution arm, Picturehouse.

Len Amato, producer and as the president of Spring Creek Productions, was appointed HBO Films senior vice president in March 2007. In 2008, Picturehouse was discontinued with distribution being handled by WB&#x27;s main distribution arm. HBO Films exited the theatrical film market with Picturehouse&#x27;s closure. With Callender leaving to form his own production company in late 2008, no division president is appointed with department heads becoming president of their departments, Kary Antholis at HBO Miniseries, and Amato at HBO Films. Both answered to president of programming group/West Coast operations, Michael Lombardo.

==Reception==
The films produced by the company have garnered hundreds of Primetime Emmy Awards, 694 nominations with 162 wins, and Golden Globe Awards. HBO Films productions have won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie every year from 1993 to 2015 and 2020, except for four years. &quot;Elephant&quot; is the first film produced by HBO Films to win the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

==HBO NYC Productions==
HBO Showcase was started as a second film banner for HBO in 1986 to expand the boundary of drama. &quot;Age Old Friends&quot; (1989) was the unit&#x27;s first production to earn an Emmy Award. In 1996, HBO Showcase was expanded and given a new name HBO NYC Productions.

In April 1999, Colin Callender, executive VP of HBO NYC, was promoted to be HBO Pictures president. In October 1999, HBO NYC Productions was merged into HBO Pictures and renamed HBO Films under division president Callender.

In 2002, Keri Putnam was named the Executive Vice President of Movies and Mini-series at HBO Films before moving to Miramax Films in 2006.

<text>A gravity dam is a dam constructed from concrete or stone masonry and designed to hold back water by using only the weight of the material and its resistance against the foundation. Gravity dams are designed so that each section of the dam is stable and independent of any other dam section.

== Characteristics ==
Gravity dams generally require stiff rock foundations of high bearing strength (slightly weathered to fresh), although in rare cases, they have been built on soil.

Stability of the dam primarily arises from the range of normal force angles viably generated by the foundation. Also, the stiff nature of a gravity dam structure endures differential foundation settlement poorly, as it can crack the dam structure.

The main advantage to gravity dams over embankments is the scour-resistance of concrete, which protects against damage from minor over-topping flows. Unexpected large over-topping flows are still a problem, as they can scour dam foundations. A disadvantage of gravity dams is that their large concrete structures are susceptible to destabilising uplift pressures relative to the surrounding soil. Uplift pressures can be reduced by internal and foundation drainage systems.

During construction, the exothermic curing of concrete can generate large amounts of heat. The poorly-conductive concrete then traps this heat in the dam structure for decades, expanding the plastic concrete and leaving it susceptible to cracking while cooling. It is the designer&#x27;s task to ensure this does not occur.

== Design ==
Gravity dams are built by first cutting away a large part of the land in one section of a river, allowing water to fill the space and be stored. Once the land has been cut away, the soil has to be tested to make sure it can support the weight of the dam and the water. It is important to make sure the soil will not erode over time, which would allow the water to cut a way around or under the dam. Sometimes the soil is sufficient to achieve these goals; however, other times it requires conditioning by adding support rocks which will bolster the weight of the dam and water. There are three different tests that can be done to determine the foundation&#x27;s support strength: the Westergaard, Eulerian, and Lagrangian approaches. Once the foundation is suitable to build on, construction of the dam can begin. Usually gravity dams are built out of a strong material such as concrete or stone blocks, and are built into a triangular shape to provide the most support.

== Classifications ==
The most common classification of gravity dams is by the materials composing the structure:
* Concrete dams include
** mass concrete dams, made of:
*** conventional concrete: Dworshak Dam, Grand Coulee Dam
*** Roller-Compacted Concrete (RCC): Willow Creek Dam (Oregon), Upper Stillwater Dam
** masonry: Aswan Low Dam, Pathfinder Dam, Cheesman Dam
** hollow gravity dams, made of reinforced concrete: Braddock Dam

Composite dams are a combination of concrete and embankment dams. Construction materials of composite dams are the same used for concrete and embankment dams.

Gravity dams can be classified by plan (shape):
* Most gravity dams are straight (Grand Coulee Dam).
* Some masonry and concrete gravity dams have the dam axis curved (Shasta Dam, Cheesman Dam) to add stability through arch action.

Gravity dams can be classified with respect to their structural height:
* Low, up to 100 feet.
* Medium high, between 100 and 300 feet.
* High, over 300 feet.

== Earthquakes ==
Gravity dams are built to withstand some of the strongest earthquakes. Even though the foundation of a gravity dam is built to support the weight of the dam and all the water, it is quite flexible in that it absorbs a large amount of energy and sends it into the Earth&#x27;s crust. It needs to be able to absorb the energy from an earthquake because, if the dam were to break, it would send a mass amount of water rushing downstream and destroy everything in its way. Earthquakes are the biggest danger to gravity dams and that is why, every year and after every major earthquake, they must be tested for cracks, durability, and strength. Although gravity dams are expected to last anywhere from 50–150 years, they need to be maintained and regularly replaced.

<text>An arch dam is a concrete dam that is curved upstream in plan. The arch dam is designed so that the force of the water against it, known as hydrostatic pressure, presses against the arch, causing the arch to straighten slightly and strengthening the structure as it pushes into its foundation or abutments. An arch dam is most suitable for narrow canyons or gorges with steep walls of stable rock to support the structure and stresses. Since they are thinner than any other dam type, they require much less construction material, making them economical and practical in remote areas.

==Classification==
In general, arch dams are classified based on the ratio of the base thickness to the structural height (b/h) as:
* Thin, for b/h less than 0.2, 
* Medium-thick, for b/h between 0.2 and 0.3, and 
* Thick, for b/h ratio over 0.3.

Arch dams classified with respect to their structural height are:
* Low dams up to ,
* Medium high dams between ,
* High dams over .

== History ==
The development of arch dams throughout history began with the Romans in the 1st century BC and after several designs and techniques were developed, relative uniformity was achieved in the 20th century. The first known arch dam, the Glanum Dam, also known as the Vallon de Baume Dam, was built by the Romans in France and it dates back to the 1st century BC. The dam was about high and in length. Its radius was about , and it consisted of two masonry walls. The Romans built it to supply nearby Glanum with water.

The Monte Novo Dam in Portugal was another early arch dam built by the Romans in 300 AD. It was high and , with a radius of . The curved ends of the dam met with two winged walls that were later supported by two buttresses. The dam also contained two water outlets to drive mills downstream.

The Dara Dam was another arch dam built by the Romans in which the historian Procopius would write of its design: &quot;This barrier was not built in a straight line, but was bent into the shape of a crescent, so that the curve, by lying against the current of the river, might be able to offer still more resistance to the force of the stream.&quot;

The Mongols also built arch dams in modern-day Iran. Their earliest was the Kebar Dam built around 1300, which was high and long, and had a radius of . Their second dam was built around 1350 and is called the Kurit Dam. After was added to the dam in 1850, it became tall and remained the tallest dam in the world until the early 20th century. The Kurit Dam was of masonry design and built in a very narrow canyon. The canyon was so narrow that its crest length is only 44% of its height. The dam is still erect, even though part of its lower downstream face fell off.

The Tibi Dam in Tibi, Spain was a post-medieval arch dam built between 1579 and 1594 and the first in Europe since the Romans. The dam was high and long. This arch dam rests on the mountains sides.

In the early 20th century, the world&#x27;s first variable-radius arch dam was built on the Salmon Creek near Juneau, Alaska. The Salmon Creek Dam&#x27;s upstream face bulged upstream, which relieved pressure on the stronger, curved lower arches near the abutments. The dam also had a larger toe, which off-set pressure on the upstream heel of the dam, which now curved more downstream. The technology and economical benefits of the Salmon Creek Dam allowed for larger and taller dam designs. The dam was, therefore, revolutionary, and similar designs were soon adopted around the world, in particular by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

In 1920, the Swiss engineer and dam designer Alfred Stucky developed new calculation methods for arch dams, introducing the concept of elasticity during the construction of the Montsalvens arch dam in Switzerland, thereby improving the dam profile in the vertical direction by using a parabolic arch shape instead of a circular arch shape.

Pensacola Dam, completed in the state of Oklahoma in 1940, was considered the longest multiple arch dam in the United States. Designed by W. R. Holway, it has 51 arches. and a maximum height of above the river bed. The total length of the dam and its sections is while the multiple-arch section is long and its combination with the spillway sections measure . Each arch in the dam has a clear span of and each buttress is wide.

Arch dam designs would continue to test new limits and designs such as the double- and multiple-curve. Alfred Stucky and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation developed a method of weight and stress distribution in the 1960s, and arch dam construction in the United States would see its last surge then with dams like the 143-meter double-curved Morrow Point Dam in Colorado, completed in 1968. By the late 20th century, arch dam design reached a relative uniformity in design around the world. Currently, the tallest arch dam in the world is the Jingpin-I Dam in China, which was completed in 2013. The longest multiple arch with buttress dam in the world is the Daniel-Johnson Dam in Quebec, Canada. It is high and long across its crest. It was completed in 1968 and put in service in 1970.

Pensacola Dam was one of the last multiple arch types built in the United States. Its NRHP application states that this was because three dams of this type failed: (1) Gem Lake Dam, St. Francis Dam (California), Lake Hodges Dam (California). None of these failures were inherently caused by the multiple arch design.

== Design ==
The design of an arch dam is a very complex process. It starts with an initial dam layout, that is continually improved until the design objectives are achieved within the design criteria.

===Loads===
The main loads for which an arch dam is designed are:
* Dead load
* Hydrostatic load generated by the reservoir and the tailwater
* Temperature load
* Earthquake load

Other miscellaneous loads that affect a dam include: ice and silt loads, and uplift pressure.


Most often, the arch dam is made of concrete and placed in a V-shaped valley. The foundation or abutments for an arch dam must be very stable and proportionate to the concrete. There are two basic designs for an arch dam: &quot;constant-radius dams&quot;, which have constant radius of curvature, and &quot;variable-radius dams&quot;, which have both upstream and downstream curves that systematically decrease in radius below the crest. A dam that is &quot;double-curved&quot; in both its horizontal and vertical planes may be called a dome dam. Arch dams with more than one contiguous arch or plane are described as multiple-arch dams. Early examples include the Roman Esparragalejo Dam with later examples such as the Daniel-Johnson Dam (1968) and Itaipu Dam (1982). However, as a result of the failure of the Gleno Dam shortly after it was constructed in 1923, the construction of new multiple arch dams has become less popular.

Contraction joints are normally placed every 20 m in the arch dam and are later filled with grout after the control cools and cures.

== Types ==
; Constant radii arch dam : the upstream face of the dam has a constant radius making it a linear shape face throughout the height of the dam. But the inner curves their radius reduces as we move down from top elevation to bottom and thus in cross-section it makes a shape of the triangle.
; Variable arch dam : the radius of both inner and outer faces of the dam arch varies from bottom to top. The radius of the arch is greatest at the top and lowest at lower elevations. The central angle of the arch is also widened as we move upside.
; Constant angle arch dam : this is the most economical in construction. However, for the third type of arch dam stronger foundation is required as it involves overhangs at the abutment sections. The constant angle arch dam is that in which the central angles of the horizontal arch rings are of the same magnitude at all elevations.

<text>In corporate finance, capital structure refers to the mix of various forms of external funds, known as capital, used to finance a business. It consists of shareholders&#x27; equity, debt (borrowed funds), and preferred stock, and is detailed in the company&#x27;s balance sheet. The larger the debt component is in relation to the other sources of capital, the greater financial leverage (or gearing, in the United Kingdom) the firm is said to have. Too much debt can increase the risk of the company and reduce its financial flexibility, which at some point creates concern among investors and results in a greater cost of capital. Company management is responsible for establishing a capital structure for the corporation that makes optimal use of financial leverage and holds the cost of capital as low as possible.

Capital structure is an important issue in setting rates charged to customers by regulated utilities in the United States. The utility company has the right to choose any capital structure it deems appropriate, but regulators determine an appropriate capital structure and cost of capital for ratemaking purposes.

Various leverage or gearing ratios are closely watched by financial analysts to assess the amount of debt in a company&#x27;s capital structure.

The Miller and Modigliani theorem argues that the market value of a firm is unaffected by a change in its capital structure. This school of thought is generally viewed as a purely theoretical result, since it assumes a perfect market and disregards factors such as fluctuations and uncertain situations that may arise in financing a firm. In academia, much attention has been given to debating and relaxing the assumptions made by Miller and Modigliani to explain why a firm&#x27;s capital structure is relevant to its value in the real world.

== Basic concepts ==
===Leverage===
Up to a certain point, the use of debt (such as bonds or bank loans) in a company&#x27;s capital structure is beneficial. When debt is a portion of a firm&#x27;s capital structure, it permits the company to achieve greater earnings per share than would be possible by issuing equity. This is because the interest paid by the firm on the debt is tax-deductible. The reduction in taxes permits more of the company&#x27;s operating income to flow through to investors. The related increase in earnings per share is called financial leverage or gearing in the United Kingdom and Australia. Financial leverage can be beneficial when the business is expanding and profitable, but it is detrimental when the business enters a contraction phase. The interest on the debt must be paid regardless of the level of the company&#x27;s operating income, or bankruptcy may be the result. If the firm does not prosper and profits do not meet management&#x27;s expectations, too much debt (i.e., too much leverage) increases the risk that the firm may not be able to pay its creditors. At some point this makes investors apprehensive and increases the firm&#x27;s cost of borrowing or issuing new equity.

===Optimal capital structure===
It is important that a company&#x27;s management recognizes the risk inherent in taking on debt, and maintains an optimal capital structure with an appropriate balance between debt and equity. An optimal capital structure is one that is consistent with minimizing the cost of debt and equity financing and maximizing the value of the firm. Internal policy decisions with respect to capital structure and debt ratios must be tempered by a recognition of how outsiders view the strength of the firm&#x27;s financial position. Key considerations include maintaining the firm&#x27;s credit rating at a level where it can attract new external funds on reasonable terms, and maintaining a stable dividend policy and good earnings record.

===Term structure of debt in capital structure ===
Once management has decided how much debt should be used in the capital structure, decisions must be made as to the appropriate mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. Increasing the percentage of short-term debt can enhance a firm&#x27;s financial flexibility, since the borrower&#x27;s commitment to pay interest is for a shorter period of time. But short-term debt also exposes the firm to greater refinancing risk. Therefore, as the percentage of short-term debt in a firm&#x27;s capital structure increases, equity holders will expect greater returns on equity to compensate for the increased risk, according to a 2022 article in &quot;The Journal of Finance.&quot;

===Seniority===
In the event of bankruptcy, the seniority of the capital structure comes into play. A typical company has the following seniority structure listed from most senior to least:
*senior debt, including mortgage bonds secured by specifically pledged property,
*subordinated (or junior) debt, including debenture bonds which are dependent upon the general credit and financial strength of the company for their security,
*preferred stock, whose holders are entitled to have their claims met before those of common stockholders, and
* equity, which includes common stock and retained earnings.

In practice, the capital structure may be complex and include other sources of capital.

==Leverage or capital gearing ratios==
Financial analysts use some form of leverage ratio to quantify the proportion of debt and equity in a company&#x27;s capital structure, and to make comparisons between companies. Using figures from the balance sheet, the debt-to-capital ratio can be calculated as shown below.
:::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| debt-to-capitalization ratio = dollar amount of debt/ dollar amount of total capitalization
The debt-to-equity ratio and capital gearing ratio are widely used for the same purpose.
:::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| capital gearing ratio = dollar amount of capital bearing risk/ dollar amount of capital not bearing risk
Capital bearing risk includes debentures (risk is to pay interest) and preference capital (risk to pay dividend at fixed rate).
Capital not bearing risk includes equity.

Therefore, one can also say,
Capital gearing ratio = (Debentures + Preference share capital) : (shareholders&#x27; funds)

==In public utility regulation==
Capital structure is an important issue in setting rates charged to customers by regulated utilities in the United States. Ratemaking practice in the U.S. holds that rates paid by a utility&#x27;s customers should be set at a level which assures that the company can provide reliable service at reasonable cost. The cost of capital is among the costs a utility must be allowed to recover from customers, and depends on the company&#x27;s capital structure. The utility company may choose whatever capital structure it deems appropriate, but regulators determine an appropriate capital structure and cost of capital for ratemaking purposes.

==Modigliani–Miller theorem==
 
The Modigliani–Miller theorem, proposed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller in 1958, forms the basis for modern academic thinking on capital structure. It is generally viewed as a purely theoretical result since it disregards many important factors in the capital structure process factors like fluctuations and uncertain situations that may occur in the course of financing a firm. The theorem states that, in a perfect market, how a firm is financed is irrelevant to its value. This result provides the base with which to examine real world reasons why capital structure &quot;is&quot; relevant, that is, a company&#x27;s value is affected by the capital structure it employs. Some other reasons include bankruptcy costs, agency costs, taxes, and information asymmetry. This analysis can then be extended to look at whether there is in fact an optimal capital structure: the one which maximizes the value of the firm.

Consider a perfect capital market (no transaction or bankruptcy costs; perfect information); firms and individuals can borrow at the same interest rate; no taxes; and investment returns are not affected by financial uncertainty. Assuming perfections in the capital is a mirage and unattainable as suggested by Modigliani and Miller.

Modigliani and Miller made two findings under these conditions. Their first &#x27;proposition&#x27; was that the value of a company is independent of its capital structure. Their second &#x27;proposition&#x27; stated that the cost of equity for a leveraged firm is equal to the cost of equity for an unleveraged firm, plus an added premium for financial risk. That is, as leverage increases, risk is shifted between different investor classes, while the total firm risk is constant, and hence no extra value created.

Their analysis was extended to include the effect of taxes and risky debt. Under a classical tax system, the tax-deductibility of interest makes debt financing valuable; that is, the cost of capital decreases as the proportion of debt in the capital structure increases. The optimal structure would be to have virtually no equity at all, i.e. a capital structure consisting of 99.99% debt.

==Variations on the Miller-Modigliani theorem==
If capital structure is irrelevant in a perfect market, then imperfections which exist in the real world must be the cause of its relevance. The theories below try to address some of these imperfections, by relaxing assumptions made in the Modigliani–Miller theorem.

===Trade-off theory===

Trade-off theory of capital structure allows bankruptcy cost to exist as an offset to the benefit of using debt as tax shield. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, namely, the tax benefits of debt and that there is a cost of financing with debt the bankruptcy costs and the financial distress costs of debt. This theory also refers to the idea that a company chooses how much equity finance and how much debt finance to use by considering both costs and benefits. The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Empirically, this theory may explain differences in debt-to-equity ratios between industries, but it doesn&#x27;t explain differences within the same industry.

===Pecking order theory===

Pecking order theory tries to capture the costs of asymmetric information. It states that companies prioritize their sources of financing (from internal financing to equity) according to the law of least effort, or of least resistance, preferring to raise equity as a financing means &quot;of last resort&quot;. Hence, internal financing is used first; when that is depleted, debt is issued; and when it is no longer sensible to issue any more debt, equity is issued. This theory maintains that businesses adhere to a hierarchy of financing sources and prefer internal financing when available, and debt is preferred over equity if external financing is required (equity would mean issuing shares which meant &#x27;bringing external ownership&#x27; into the company). Thus, the form of debt a firm chooses can act as a signal of its need for external finance.

The pecking order theory has been popularized by Myers (1984) when he argued that equity is a less preferred means to raise capital, because when managers (who are assumed to know better about true condition of the firm than investors) issue new equity, investors believe that managers think the firm is overvalued, and managers are taking advantage of the assumed over-valuation. As a result, investors may place a lower value to the new equity issuance.

===Capital structure substitution theory===

The capital structure substitution theory is based on the hypothesis that company management may manipulate capital structure such that earnings per share (EPS) are maximized. The model is not normative i.e. and does not state that management should maximize EPS, it simply hypothesizes they do.

The 1982 SEC rule 10b-18 allowed public companies open-market repurchases of their own stock and made it easier to manipulate capital structure. This hypothesis leads to a larger number of testable predictions. First, it has been deducted that market average earnings yield will be in equilibrium with the market average interest rate on corporate bonds after corporate taxes, which is a reformulation of the &#x27;Fed model&#x27;. The second prediction has been that companies with a high valuation ratio, or low earnings yield, will have little or no debt, whereas companies with low valuation ratios will be more leveraged. When companies have a dynamic debt-equity target, this explains why some companies use dividends and others do not. A fourth prediction has been that there is a negative relationship in the market between companies&#x27; relative price volatilities and their leverage. This contradicts Hamada who used the work of Modigliani and Miller to derive a positive relationship between these two variables.

===Agency costs===

Three types of agency costs can help explain the relevance of capital structure.
* Asset substitution effect: As debt-to-equity ratio increases, management has an incentive to undertake risky, even negative net present value (NPV) projects. This is because if the project is successful, share holders earn the benefit, whereas if it is unsuccessful, debtors experience the downside.
* Underinvestment problem or debt overhang problem: If debt is risky e.g., in a growth company, the gain from the project will accrue to debt holders rather than shareholders. Thus, management have an incentive to reject positive NPV projects, even though they have the potential to increase firm value.
* Free cash flow: unless free cash flow is given back to investors, management has an incentive to destroy firm value through empire building and perks etc. Increasing leverage imposes financial discipline on management.

===Structural corporate finance===
An active area of research in finance is that which tries to translate the models above as well as others into a structured theoretical setup that is time-consistent and that has a dynamic set up similar to one that can be observed in the real world. Managerial contracts, debt contracts, equity contracts, investment returns, all have long lived, multi-period implications. Therefore, it is hard to think through what the implications of the basic models above are for the real world if they are not embedded in a dynamic structure that approximates reality. 
A similar type of research is performed under the guise of credit risk research in which the modeling of the likelihood of default and its pricing is undertaken under different assumptions about investors and about the incentives of management, shareholders and debt holders. Examples of research in this area are Goldstein, Ju, Leland (1998) and Hennessy and Whited (2004).

=== Capital structure and macroeconomic conditions ===
In addition to firm-specific characteristics, researchers find macroeconomic conditions have a material impact on capital structure choice. Korajczyk, Lucas, and McDonald (1990) provide evidence of equity issues cluster following a run-up in the equity market. Korajczyk and Levy (2003) find that target leverage is counter-cyclical for unconstrained firms, but pro-cyclical for firms that are constrained; macroeconomic conditions are significant for issue choice for firms that can time their issue choice to coincide with periods of favorable macroeconomic conditions, while constrained firms cannot. Levy and Hennessy (2007) highlight that trade-offs between agency problems and risk sharing vary over the business cycle and can result in the observed patterns. Others have related these patterns with asset pricing puzzles.

=== Capital structure persistence ===
Corporate leverage ratios are initially determined. Low relative to high leverage ratios are largely persistent despite time variation. Variation in capital structures is primarily determined by factors that remain stable for long periods of time. These stable factors are unobservable.

=== Growth type compatibility ===
Firms rationally invest and seek financing in a manner compatible with their growth types. As economic and market conditions improve, low growth type firms are keener to issue new debt than equity, whereas high growth type firms are least likely to issue debt and keenest to issue equity. Distinct growth types are persistent. Consistent with a generalized Myers–Majluf framework, growth type compatibility enables distinct growth types and hence specifications of market imperfection or informational environments to persist, generating capital structure persistence.

===Other===
* Capital supply — capital structure also depends on the relative supply of equity vs. debt capital available to the firm.
* The neutral mutation hypothesis — firms fall into various financing habits that do not impact value.
* Market timing hypothesis—capital structure is the outcome of the cumulative historical timing of the market by managers.
* Accelerated investment effect—even in the absence of agency costs, levered firms invest faster because of the existence of default risk.
* In transition economies, there has been evidence reported unveiling the significant impact of capital structure on firm performance, especially short-term debt such as the case of Vietnamese emerging market economy.

==Arbitrage==
A capital structure arbitrageur seeks to profit from differential pricing of various instruments issued by one corporation. Consider, for example, traditional bonds, and convertible bonds. The latter are bonds that are, under contracted-for conditions, convertible into shares of equity. The stock-option component of a convertible bond has a calculable value in itself. The value of the whole instrument &quot;should&quot; be the value of the traditional bonds &quot;plus&quot; the extra value of the option feature. If the spread (the difference between the convertible and the non-convertible bonds) grows excessively, then the capital-structure arbitrageur will bet that it will converge.

<text>Appleby College is an international independent school (grades 7–12) located in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, founded in 1911 by John Guest, a former Headmaster of the Preparatory School at Upper Canada College. Guest dreamed of establishing a small boarding school in the country, and did so with the support and financial assistance of his father-in-law, Sir Byron Edmund Walker, a Canadian businessman. Today, Appleby is a co-educational day and boarding university-preparatory school, with a curriculum based around the liberal arts. It is situated on Lake Ontario in Oakville, Ontario, roughly 50 kilometres west of Toronto. Students are drawn primarily from Oakville, Burlington and Mississauga, but boarding students come from other parts of Canada and throughout all continents of the world.

Appleby is one of two Canadian members of the G30 Schools. It is also a member of the International Round Square Organisation and the Canadian Independent Schools Athletic Association. Appleby is accredited by the Canadian Educational Standards Institute. 

== History ==

*Originally called Appleby School when it opened in 1911 (the school had 29 students), it was renamed Appleby College in 1941.
*The first Argus (the school yearbook) was published in 1916.
*The school chapel was completed after seven years of construction, and dedicated in November 1929.
*Ferdinand Herbert Marani (architect) of Marani &amp; Paisley designed several buildings on campus including: the gymnasium, swimming pool, administration building, and classroom building (1948–49)
*In 1956 the memorial entrance to the classroom building was completed, in commemoration of the Appleby boys and master who had been killed in World War I and World War II.
*Appleby marked its 50th anniversary in 1961 with a significant building expansion. A dining hall was built and named after John Guest, the founder and first headmaster. A third boarding residence, &quot;New House&quot; was opened, later renamed Walker House after the school&#x27;s original benefactor.
*In 1968 the school chapel, formerly the Memorial Chapel, was expanded to its present size and renamed the John Bell Chapel in honour of the third headmaster, who retired that year. The first Appleby Quarterly, Appleby&#x27;s alumni newsletter, was also published this year.
*In 1970 the swimming pool and J.S. Gairdner hockey arena were opened. Previously Appleby hockey was played at the Oakville Arena.
*In 1971 with enrollment rising, Appleby was split into a Junior and Senior School. Junior School consisted of grades 4 through 8. Previously the school had admitted boys as young as grade 1. Senior School consisted of grades 9 through 13.
*In 1973, Appleby introduced the innovative Northward Bound outdoor education program at the school&#x27;s &quot;Northern Campus&quot; on Rabbitnose Island, Lake Temagami.
*In 1976, participation in the Senior School Cadet Corps became optional for students in grades 11 through 13. In 1984, it became a completely voluntary corps. Appleby maintained #440 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps for 93 years, until 2008, and it was open to both boys and girls.
*In 1979, the school cook, Hilda Chattaway, reached a remarkable milestone of 50 years of continuous service to Appleby. She continued to run the school&#x27;s kitchen until her death in 1985. In 1982 the Junior School boarding dormitory located on the top floor of Colley House was named after her. However, boarding for the Junior grades was discontinued in 1990.
*September 1980 marked the first time day students outnumbered boarders
*Appleby commemorated its 75th anniversary during the 1985–1986 school year. Memorable events from that year included the first football team&#x27;s undefeated season and first and only CISAA championship, and the visit of Lady Mountbatten to officially open the new wing to the classroom building. The new facility was called Nicholas Court and housed facilities for art, music and debating, in addition to new classrooms.
*Appleby was one of the first high schools in Ontario to eliminate Grade 13, moving to a four-year program with a &quot;double cohort&quot; graduating class in 1987. All high schools in Ontario moved from a five-year to a four-year program .
*In 1990, Saturday classes were eliminated. Previously, a chapel service and classes were held on Saturday mornings and sports were played in the afternoon. Up until the 1970s, boarders had also attended a Sunday church service at St. Jude&#x27;s Anglican Church in Oakville.
*Prior to becoming co-educational in 1991, Appleby was a school for boys only. Girls were admitted in grades 6 to 11. Before then, Appleby&#x27;s sister school was St. Mildred&#x27;s-Lightbourn School, an Oakville private school for girls. Appleby and St. Mildred&#x27;s often collaborated in drama, for example.
*At the same time that girls were admitted, grades 4 through 6 were phased out, and the Junior School/ Senior School division was eliminated. Michael Nightingale was the Director of the Junior School for all twenty years that it existed.
*In 1993 Appleby saw its first co-educational graduating class. By that fall, the school had taken on its present character of a completely co-educational school for students in grades 7 through 12. A fourth boarding residence, Baillie House, was also built for female students.
*In 2011, Appleby celebrated its 100th anniversary.

== Boarding ==
As well as being a day school, boarding is offered from Grades 9 though 12 (7 and 8 can board but they live with faculty who live near campus) and there are numerous international students from over 20 countries attending Appleby. When the school first opened in 1911, boarding was mandatory. Less than half of students board. Since 1911 all students in their &quot;Senior Two&quot; (Grade 12) year are required to go into residence..

There are four houses in which Appleby&#x27;s boarding students reside, and with which the day students are affiliated: Baillie House; Walker House; Colley House; and Powell&#x27;s House. Baillie House is a girls&#x27; residence and named after a prominent family that has attended and supported Appleby for several generations. Walker House was one of three boys&#x27; residences before co-education and is now a girls&#x27; residence, and is named for the school&#x27;s original benefactor, Sir Byron Edmund Walker. Colley and Powell&#x27;s are boys&#x27; residences and are named for former Appleby Masters. T.B. Colley taught at Appleby for 35 years and was housemaster of School House, which was renamed in his honour in 1949. Vernon Powell received the Military Cross and died during World War I.

Students are divided into their respective houses in &quot;Upper One&quot; (Grade 9) and participate in house activities throughout the year. Boarding students in Baillie House and Powell&#x27;s House have roommates. In Colley House and Walker House, students may be eligible to have a single room without a roommate.

<doc id="866616" wikidata="Q910910" url="?curid=866616" title="WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1996–2007)">
<text>The WWE Cruiserweight Championship was a professional wrestling championship originally used in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and later, World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE). It was contested by wrestlers under 225 lbs, billed as cruiserweights. Following the acquisition of WCW by the then-WWF in 2001, it became a WWF (and later, WWE) championship and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. During the first WWE brand extension, it was the only title to be exclusive to the SmackDown! brand during its entire tenure.

The championship was created in WCW in 1996, with Shinjiro Otani as the inaugural champion. However, following WCW&#x27;s purchase, the WWF/E considered the title to be a continuation of the earlier WCW Light Heavyweight Championship, which had been created in 1991 with Brian Pillman as the inaugural champion. The World Cruiserweight Championship was retired in 2007 with Hornswoggle as its final holder.

Another WWE Cruiserweight Championship was created in 2016, and although both championships had shared the same name (before the newer title was renamed to NXT Cruiserweight Championship in 2019), the newer championship did not carry the lineage of the original. The newer title also had a different weight limit of 205 lbs (93 kg) before the championship was retired in 2022.

== History ==

The championship was originally created as the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on March 20, 1996. However, after the acquisition of World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (WCW) assets by rival company World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), both lineages of the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship and the WCW Cruiserweight Championship were considered to be one and the same, with WWE referring to the holders of the Light Heavyweight Championship as former Cruiserweight Champions. During the existence of WCW, the two titles were considered distinct and did not share a common lineage.

Following the introduction of the Light Heavyweight Championship in 1991 (which WCW had considered to be a separate title), a tournament was held to determine the inaugural champion. On October 27, Brian Pillman defeated Richard Morton in the tournament final to win the title. However, when Brad Armstrong was forced to relinquish the title due to injury on September 2, 1992, it became inactive. Then, on March 20, 1996, Shinjiro Otani defeated Wild Pegasus (Chris Benoit) in a decision match to win what then became known as the WCW Cruiserweight Championship.

In March 2001, the WWF purchased WCW. Soon after, &quot;The Invasion&quot; took place, in which The Alliance was ultimately dismantled. Following the Survivor Series pay-per-view in November 2001, the title was renamed the WWF Cruiserweight Championship, replacing the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. After the introduction of the brand extension in March 2002, the championship became exclusive to the SmackDown! brand. The title was then renamed as the WWE Cruiserweight Championship after the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May that same year. Around 2005, WWE began referring to the title as the &quot;Cruiserweight Championship of the World&quot;, but the official name of the title was not changed to reflect this.
On September 28, 2007, the title was vacated after the final champion, Hornswoggle, was stripped of the championship by SmackDown! General Manager, Vickie Guerrero. Hornswoggle had won the championship in a Cruiserweight Open at that year&#x27;s The Great American Bash pay-per-view event. The last match contested for the title occurred on the August 31, 2007, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where Hornswoggle successfully defended the title against Jamie Noble.

After a six-month absence, WWE removed the championship from the active championship web page to the defunct championship list. In this way, the title was quietly retired. WWE lists its retirement year as 2007.

== Brand designation history ==
Following the introduction of the brand split on March 25, 2002, all titles in WWE became exclusive to either the Raw or SmackDown! brand.

== Belt design ==

The original design of the title has a blue with gold imprinting of the earth in the middle with the word world above it in the center plate that&#x27;s gold squarely surrounded by the color black, It also has the word wrestling champions under the blue earth in that same way. It also has the word cruiserweight in the middle that&#x27;s gold and the center with a circle-ish red surrounding it in the center of the earth and the side plates are a square-ish gold with the WCW Logos on the side that are a thick red with one extra side plate on the right side that&#x27;s smaller than them all. All of the plates on the title are gold mainly with indented designs, colors &amp; wordings.

The 2002–2007 design of the title is similar to the first but with 4 side plates minus an earth in the middle and WWE Logos on the side plates (On two only closest to the center plate minus the two out-ist) and in the middle plate at the top.

== Reigns ==

Gregory Helms&#x27; third reign was the longest reign at 385 days (384 days as recognized by WWE). Helms won the championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble in a Cruiserweight Open, despite originally being a member of the Raw brand; he transferred to SmackDown! in conjunction with winning the title. He lost it in a Cruiserweight Open at No Way Out in 2007, thirteen months later, to Chavo Guerrero Jr. Psicosis had the shortest title reign, holding it for approximately one hour. Rey Mysterio Jr. had the most reigns at eight, spread across both WCW and WWE (five reigns in WCW and three in WWE). Three women held the championship; Madusa and Daffney both had reigns in WCW, while Jacqueline was the only woman to win it after it became a WWE championship.

<text>Niki Haris (born April 17, 1962) is an American singer and dancer of pop, R&amp;B, jazz and dance music. She was one of Madonna&#x27;s backing vocalists from 1987 to 2001, and the guest lead vocalist on various Snap! singles in the early 1990s.

==Early life and family==
Haris was born Gina Nichole Haire in Benton Harbor, Michigan on April 17, 1962, the daughter of jazz musician Gene Harris. She attended college in Southern California before pursuing a singing career in amusement parks and clubs in the California area.

Haris gave birth to a daughter, Jordan Ann, in 2003. The father is Club Nouveau member, producer, songwriter (and Karyn White&#x27;s manager) Jay King.

==Music career==

Haris became a close friend of, backing vocalist and dancer for Madonna during her &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; Tour (1987). She appeared in the documentary film &quot;&quot; (1991), directed by Alek Keshishian, which chronicled various personal and entertaining moments (both off- and on-stage) during Madonna’s iconic—and controversial—&quot;Blond Ambition Tour&quot; (1991). Haris also appeared in the music videos for Madonna’s number-one hit songs &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990) and &quot;Music&quot; (2000). Along with fellow backup singer Donna De Lory, Haris provided backup vocals on many of Madonna’s records between 1987 and 2000, appeared in numerous recorded and televised Madonna performances, and participated in four out of Madonna’s eight concert tours, namely the &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; Tour (1987), the &quot;Blond Ambition Tour&quot; (1990)&quot;, The Girlie Show&quot; Tour (1993) and The &quot;Drowned World&quot; Tour (2001). The &quot;Who’s That Girl Tour&quot; performance in Turin, Italy, was broadcast live globally, and eventually released on home video, titled Ciao, Italia: Live from Italy (1988). One of &quot;The Girlie Show&quot; dates in Sydney, Australia, was filmed for VHS/DVD, and the &quot;Drowned World Tour&quot; performance in Madonna’s hometown of Detroit, Michigan was broadcast live on HBO, prior to VHS/DVD release. Both Haris and De Lory featured prominently in these concert tours, providing not only backing vocals and dancing but also comedic banter and interaction with Madonna throughout the shows.

For the &quot;Re-Invention&quot; Tour in 2004, Haris was replaced with Siedah Garrett. The official word from Haris was that she &quot;would like to focus on her solo career and family&quot;. Haris was also absent from Madonna&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Confessions&quot; Tour (2006), the &quot;Sticky &amp; Sweet&quot; Tour (2008-09), the &quot;MDNA&quot; Tour (2012) and the &quot;Rebel Heart&quot; Tour (2015-16), as well as from providing backing vocals on each tour’s respective album.

Her vocal film work is also featured on the soundtracks of &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot;, &quot;The Big Green&quot;, &quot;Noises Off&quot;, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, &quot;Urban Legends: Bloody Mary&quot; and &quot;Anastasia&quot;. She has also recorded television themes, including co-writing and performing two songs for the Fox series &quot;Dark Angel&quot;.

Haris toured with her father, until his death, while promoting their albums, &quot;Down Home Blues&quot; and &quot;In His Hands&quot; and &quot;Jazz Alley Cats&quot;.

Haris performed at benefits for AIDS, cancer research and Camp Harmony for inner city children. She is a supporter for the Music in the Classroom program and Rockers Against Drunk Driving and is an annual participant in the Season for Non Violence. Niki has made several television appearances in 2008 &amp; presently in 2009 including: The Democratic National Convention 2008, CNN, Fox Network &amp; Fuse TV.

<text>False precision (also called overprecision, fake precision, misplaced precision, and spurious precision) occurs when numerical data are presented in a manner that implies better precision than is justified; since precision is a limit to accuracy (in the ISO definition of accuracy), this often leads to overconfidence in the accuracy, named precision bias.

==Overview==
Madsen Pirie defines the term &quot;false precision&quot; in a more general way: when exact numbers are used for notions that cannot be expressed in exact terms. For example, &quot;We know that 90% of the difficulty in writing is getting started.&quot; Often false precision is abused to produce an unwarranted confidence in the claim: &quot;our mouthwash is twice as good as our competitor&#x27;s&quot;.

In science and engineering, convention dictates that unless a margin of error is explicitly stated, the number of significant figures used in the presentation of data should be limited to what is warranted by the precision of those data. For example, if an instrument can be read to tenths of a unit of measurement, results of calculations using data obtained from that instrument can only be confidently stated to the tenths place, regardless of what the raw calculation returns or whether other data used in the calculation are more accurate. Even outside these disciplines, there is a tendency to assume that all the non-zero digits of a number are meaningful; thus, providing excessive figures may lead the viewer to expect better precision than exists.

However, in contrast, it is good practice to retain more significant figures than this in the intermediate stages of a calculation, in order to avoid accumulated rounding errors.

False precision commonly arises when high-precision and low-precision data are combined, when using an electronic calculator, and in conversion of units.

== Examples ==
False precision is the gist of numerous variations of a joke which can be summarized as follows: A tour guide at a museum says a dinosaur skeleton is 100,000,005 years old, because an expert told him that it was 100 million years old when he started working there 5 years ago.

If a car&#x27;s speedometer indicates a speed of 60 mph, converting it to 96.56064 km/h makes it seem like the measurement was very precise, when in fact it was not. Assuming the speedometer is accurate to 1 mph, a more appropriate conversion is 97 km/h.

Measures that rely on statistical sampling, such as IQ tests, are often reported with false precision.

<text>The Huron Institute was a school located in Milan in the U.S. state of Ohio, in what was then Huron County.

The Huron Institute owed its existence to the extensive revivals of religion in the churches of Huron Presbytery in the years 1830 and 1831. The Institute was incorporated by act of the Ohio General Assembly in 1832. With the local people being eager for the school to open, the first term was begun in April 1832 several months before the school building was completed in December 1832. Construction costs were $4,000, with $2,000 being raised by the Huron Presbytery and the balance being raised by the village of Milan.

Reverend Elded Barber was the first principal and the purpose of the school as stated in the Board of Trustees minutes was to provide &quot;instruction to youth of both sexes in the higher branches of English education, the learned languages and the liberal arts and sciences.&quot;

It was the desire of the trustees of the institute to place education within the reach of all who would avail themselves of it, and in this they succeeded as nearly as was possible. The
tuition was fixed at four dollars per quarter in the classical department, and at three dollars in the English and female department, and the principal took it upon himself to furnish instruction from the avails of the tuition bills. Board was furnished by many of the best families in Milan at merely nominal rates. No student was ever refused admission or dismissed because too poor to pay his way in the institute.

At the time it was established, it was the only school on the Western Reserve west of Hudson where young men could be prepared for college.

The Huron Institute closed in 1857 and re-opened as the Western Reserve Normal School in the next year. The Normal School continued to operate until 1889 when it closed. The building remained standing until 1910 when it was razed.

<doc id="866654" wikidata="Q1332896" url="?curid=866654" title="M-V">
<text>The M-V rocket, also called M-5 or Mu-5, was a Japanese solid-fuel rocket designed to launch scientific satellites. It was a member of the Mu family of rockets. The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) began developing the M-V in 1990 at a cost of 15 billion yen. It has three stages and is high, in diameter, and weighs about . It was capable of launching a satellite weighing into an orbit as high as .

The first M-V rocket launched the HALCA radio astronomy satellite in 1997, and the second the Nozomi Mars explorer in July 1998. The third rocket attempted to launch the Astro-E X-ray satellite on 10 February 2000 but failed. ISAS recovered from this setback and launched Hayabusa to 25143 Itokawa in 2003. The following M-V launch was the scientific Astro-E2 satellite, a replacement for Astro-E, which took place on 10 July 2005. The final launch was that of the Hinode (SOLAR-B) spacecraft, along with the SSSat microsat and a nanosatellite, HIT-SAT, on 22 September 2006.

== Launch outcomes ==
== Launch history ==


== Following program ==
A follow on to the M-V, called the &quot;Epsilon Rocket&quot;, features a lower 1.2 tonne LEO payload capability. The development aim is to reduce costs, primarily by using the H-IIA solid rocket booster as the first stage and through shorter launch preparation time. Epsilon launches are intended to cost much less than the US$70 million launch cost of a M-V.

The first launch, of a small scientific satellite SPRINT-A (Hisaki), took place in September 2013. The initial launches will be of a two-stage version, of Epsilon, with up to a 500 kilogram LEO payload capability.

== Potential as an intercontinental ballistic missile ==
Solid fuel rockets are the design of choice for military applications as they can remain in storage for long periods, and then reliably launch at short notice.

Lawmakers made national security arguments for keeping Japan&#x27;s solid-fuel rocket technology alive after ISAS was merged into JAXA, which also has the H-IIA liquid-fuelled rocket, in 2003. The ISAS director of external affairs, Yasunori Matogawa, said, &quot;It seems the hard-line national security proponents in parliament are increasing their influence, and they aren&#x27;t getting much criticism... I think we’re moving into a very dangerous period. When you consider the current environment and the threat from North Korea, it&#x27;s scary&quot;.

Toshiyuki Shikata, a Tokyo Metropolitan Government adviser and former lieutenant general, claimed that part of the rationale for the fifth M-V Hayabusa mission was that the reentry and landing of its return capsule demonstrated &quot;that Japan&#x27;s ballistic missile capability is credible&quot;.

At a technical level the M-V design could be weaponised quickly (as an Intercontinental ballistic missile, since only payload and guidance have to be changed) although this would be politically unlikely. The M-V is comparable in performance to the LGM-118 Peacekeeper ICBM.
