<text>Frankley is a village and civil parish in Worcestershire. The modern Frankley estate is part of the New Frankley civil parish in Birmingham, and has been part of the city since 1995. The parish has a population of 122.

==History==
Frankley is listed within the hundred of Cane in Worcestershire in the 1086 Domesday Survey. In the mid-12th century Cane was combined with other Domesday hundreds to form the hundred of Halfshire, which was extant through the 19th century. Adam de Harvington, or de Herwynton, (died c.1345), 
Lord Treasurer of Ireland, owned the manor of Frankley in the fourteenth century.

==St Leonards Church==
The 15th-century church building lies to the north of the village. The building is constructed from sandstone in a red and grey colour, until 1965 the tower contained two bells. A new church hall was constructed in 2005.

==Frankley services==

The village gives its name to Frankley services, a motorway service area on the M5 motorway to the north west of the village. The services opened with the motorway in 1966.

<text>Gravelly Hill is an area of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

== Location ==
Gravelly Hill is approximately 4 miles north-east of Birmingham city centre. To the north-west is Perry Barr and to the north-east are Stockland Green, Erdington and Sutton Coldfield. Aston is to the west and Washwood Heath lies to the south. The housing in the area is mostly Victorian and pre-war with some recent developments of modern apartments. Housing in the area is popular with students (particularly those attending Aston University) given its good transport links to the main campus.

==Spaghetti Junction ==

The Gravelly Hill Interchange, also known as Spaghetti Junction, provides the intersection between the A38(M) Aston Expressway from the centre of Birmingham to the M6 motorway. The complex junction also supports local roads joining the two motorways. The design of the intersection was also made complex by the presence of two railway lines including a high speed electrified railway and the existence of three canals including a turning basin, and two rivers.

== Industry ==

The area has a number of industrial units in variable condition. One of them, Gravelly Industrial Park, is among the city&#x27;s largest industrial estates. Companies with units in the park include Carlsberg, which distributes to regional accounts and national depots.

Gravelly Hill railway station is part of the Cross-City Line.

==Local government==
Gravelly Hill is a ward of Birmingham City Council; until 2018 it was part of Stockland Green ward. However it was previously a ward in its own right and also formed part of the Erdington Constituency. The previous ward was occasionally won by the Conservatives, with the mother of current Conservative Councillor for Erdington Robert Alden, narrowly losing the seat in 1976 elections. His father was parliamentary candidate in 1975-79 for the area, gaining one of the largest swings in the country in 1979.

<doc id="844607" wikidata="Q3230894" url="?curid=844607" title="Death Valley Days">
<text>Death Valley Days is an American Western anthology series featuring true accounts of the American Old West, particularly the Death Valley country of southeastern California. Created in 1930 by Ruth Woodman, the program was broadcast on radio until 1945. From 1952 to 1970, it became a syndicated television series, with reruns (updated with new narrations) continuing through August 1, 1975. The radio and television versions combined to make the show &quot;one of the longest-running Western programs in broadcast history.&quot;

The series was sponsored by the Pacific Coast Borax Company, makers of 20 Mule Team Borax and Boraxo, and hosted by Stanley Andrews (&quot;The Old Ranger&quot;) (1952–1964), Ronald Reagan (1964–1966), Robert Taylor (1966–1969), and Dale Robertson (1969–1970). Hosting the series was Reagan&#x27;s final work as an actor; he left the series in 1966 to run for governor of California.

The television series was conceived by Pacific Coast Borax Company&#x27;s advertising agency McCann-Erickson through company executive Dorothy McCann and Mitchell J. Hamilburg, who represented Gene Autry&#x27;s Flying A Productions.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Death Valley Days&quot; is one of the first anthology series to appear on television, featuring different characters and stories each episode. The stories were based in fact, all within the legends and lore of California&#x27;s Death Valley. Style varied by episode, with some being drama and others comedy. Most were human-interest stories of miners and homesteaders in Death Valley, where borax was mined.

Advertisements for the company&#x27;s best-known products, 20 Mule Team Borax, a laundry additive, Borateem, a laundry detergent, and Boraxo, a powdered hand soap, were often done by the program&#x27;s host.

As the series continued on the air, episodes began to focus on nearly any portion of the American West, not just the Death Valley country. Most episodes portrayed events in the late 19th century, the heyday of the &quot;Old West&quot;. Some, however, were set in much earlier times, especially the Spanish colonial era, and a few recounted stories from the early 20th century.

== Cast ==
Each of the 452 television episodes was introduced by a host. The longest running was &quot;The Old Ranger,&quot; a character played by veteran actor Stanley Andrews from 1952 to 1964.

Following the departure of Andrews, all subsequent hosts appeared under their own names, starting with Ronald Reagan, the former host of CBS&#x27;s &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. Reagan appeared in 21 episodes of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, including the 1965 segment &quot;A City Is Born&quot; in which he played mining developer Charles Poston, the &quot;Father of Arizona&quot;.

When Reagan left to run for governor of California, he was succeeded by Robert Taylor. Like Reagan, Taylor appeared as a character in some of the shows, including &quot;The Day All Marriages Were Cancelled&quot; (1966), also based on the career of Charles Poston. He portrayed Horace Bell in another 1967 episode, &quot;Major Horace Bell.&quot; That same year in the episode &quot;Shanghai Kelly&#x27;s Birthday Party,&quot; Taylor played James Kelly of San Francisco. After playing Porter Stockton in another 1967 episode &quot;Halo for a Badman&quot;, he would portray Texas John Slaughter, a role most associated with Tom Tryon, in the 1968 episode &quot;A Short Cut through Tombstone&quot;.

Taylor became gravely ill in 1969, and after 69 episodes was succeeded by Dale Robertson, former star of two other Western series, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; and &quot;Iron Horse&quot;. Robertson served as host and occasional actor for 23 episodes until production of new episodes ceased in 1970. In 1975, the show briefly returned in reruns, with singer Merle Haggard providing narration for some previously produced episodes.

The commercial spokesperson for the show was Rosemary DeCamp. When the show began in 1952, Dorothy McCann gave DeCamp a long-term contract to have DeCamp and her daughters appear in the commercials. She also appeared in four episodes.

While the series followed the anthology format, with all new stories and characters in each episode, the series utilized many character actors over its 18-year run. Some, (such as Don Haggerty, John Pickard, Gregg Barton, Michael Vallon, James Seay, Guy Wilkerson and Roy Engel) appeared in multiple episodes over the entire run of the series.

==Episodes==

==Background and production==

=== Development ===
In 1930, the Pacific Coast Borax Company was looking for ways to market their products, including 20 Mule Team Borax. Working with their New York advertising agency, McCann-Erickson, they settled on creating a radio program to highlight Death Valley, the obscure location of much of the company&#x27;s borax mining operations. McCann copywriter Ruth Woodman, who had experience with radio copywriting, was selected to write the show. As a long-time New Yorker, Woodman had never been to Death Valley and the initial story of the discovery of borax was written entirely from reference books. Woodman eventually decided to visit Death Valley, and eventually made several trips there to research story material for the show, which eventually became a radio hit.

In 1945, the radio show was dropped in favor of other material, but after nearly eight years, the show was re-developed for television as the Pacific Coast Borax Company sought to develop material for the new medium. Originally, McCann was interested in one minute advertising spots on television, but found so few available that full program sponsorship was more feasible. With more than 750 scripts from 14 years of radio programs, they already had the content to adapt.

For its first two years, the series was produced by Gene Autry&#x27;s Flying A Productions. In 1954, Dorrell and Stuart McGowan left Autry&#x27;s Flying A to form McGowan Productions, bringing &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; along with them. Filmaster Productions, Inc., which produced the first several seasons of &quot;Gunsmoke, Have Gun – Will Travel,&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; for CBS Television, took over production of the series in 1959, specifically noting that production company president Robert Stabler had a reputation for producing shows on-time and under budget. Production was later handled by Madison Productions.

=== Writing ===
Ruth Woodman had previously researched and written all of the scripts for the show&#x27;s radio run. When the show was re-worked for television, she continued to write all scripts for the first five years of production, at which time she became the show&#x27;s story editor. The series required historical accuracy for its stories, breaking out of the standard Western genre plotlines, instead focusing on actual pioneer events.

=== Casting ===
As an anthology, the cast changed with each episode. When Filmaster took over production in 1959, one of their immediate changes was to use bigger name Hollywood actors.

=== Filming ===
Although parts of the series were filmed in Kanab, Utah and Apacheland Studio in Arizona, the series was primarily filmed in Death Valley National Park, Segments were done on location, and shot on short, three-day schedules. Filming would take place approximately six times per year, and while on location, the cast and crew would stay at the Pacific Coast Borax Company&#x27;s Death Valley resort, the Furnace Creek Inn. Host segments for the final cut were filmed in studio.

Under the production of Filmaster, the production schedule was to complete two half-hour episodes per week, with final cut host segments shot at Producers Studios in Hollywood.

===Ownership===
Under the &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; title, the program was sponsored by the Pacific Coast Borax Company, which during the program&#x27;s run changed its name to U.S. Borax Company following a merger. The &quot;20-Mule Team Borax&quot; consumer products division of U.S. Borax was eventually bought out by the Dial Corporation, which as of 2014, as a division of the German consumer products concern Henkel, still manufactures and markets them. Rio Tinto Group absorbed the U.S. Borax mining operations in 1968 and now owns the TV series.

Although Rio Tinto still has a financial stake in this show because copyrights are still held by U.S. Borax, the major rights are now held by Element 5 Media, LLC for the broadcast rights and home video rights.

===Restoration===
Paul Korver&#x27;s company Cinelicious in Hollywood was part of the restoration of the TV series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, restoring 458 half-hour film episodes. Cinelicious worked with U.S. Borax Film Archives and Rio Tinto Group in preserving the TV series. The 16mm, and 35 mm film of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; was scanned at 4K resolution for film preservation on a Scanity starting in 2013.

==Release==

=== Broadcast ===
Beginning in 1952, the series began by using unconventional methods. First, the show was syndicated to local markets rather than released nationally. Second, they aired new programs every other week, rather than weekly. At the time, the conventional approach was exactly the opposite - national release on a weekly schedule in order to achieve a consistent audience. However, McCann-Erickson felt that the previous popularity of the radio program would overcome those obstacles, a theory that was proven in their first season of high Nielsen ratings.

McCann achieved success marketing the show directly to local stations, starting with 64 in the first season, expanding to 73 in the second, their only general difficulty being one and two-station markets.

===Rebroadcasts===
During the latter years of the series, some new episodes were still being made while older episodes were already in syndication. In some markets, new episodes could even be running in competition with older ones. To make it easier for viewers to distinguish between old and new, some blocks of syndicated &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; episodes were shown under other series names and with different hosts. This was common practice at the time among syndicated series because it was easy to reshoot the hosting portions of an episode without affecting the main content.

Some of these episodes were re-run with different sponsorship under the title &quot;The Pioneers&quot; with host Will Rogers, Jr. Similar rebroadcasts were done under the names &quot;Call of the West&quot; hosted by John Payne, &quot;Frontier Adventure&quot; hosted by Dale Robertson, &quot;Trails West&quot; hosted by Ray Milland, and &quot;Western Star Theatre&quot; hosted by Rory Calhoun. Little had to be changed other than the 20 mule team and the bugle call.

The restored TV series continues to be rebroadcast on channels such as the Encore Westerns Channel and GRIT.

=== Home media ===
Shout! Factory (on behalf of Element 5 Media LLC and Rio Tinto), has released the first two seasons on DVD in Region 1. Both seasons were released as Walmart exclusives. The third season was released on March 21, 2017 The thirteenth season was released on July 31, 2017, as a Walmart exclusive. Then, on Tuesday, October 3, 2017, the title &quot;went wide&quot; with a general retail release. The fourteenth season was released on January 2, 2018.

== Reception ==
Starting from the first season of the television series, McCann-Erickson noted that they saw a rise in sales of 20 Mule Team Borax. They also noted an increase in visitors to the Furnace Creek Inn, a Death Valley resort owned by show sponsor Pacific Coast Borax.

<text>Spaghetti junction is a nickname sometimes given to a complex or massively intertwined road traffic interchange that is said to resemble a plate of spaghetti. Such interchanges may incorporate a variety of interchange design elements in order to maximize connectivity.

==Etymology==
The term was originally used to refer to the Gravelly Hill Interchange on the M6 motorway in Birmingham, United Kingdom. In an article published in the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; on 1 June 1965 the journalist Roy Smith described plans for the junction as &quot;like a cross between a plate of spaghetti and an unsuccessful attempt at a Staffordshire knot&quot;, with the headline above the article on the newspaper&#x27;s front page, written by sub-editor Alan Eaglesfield, reading &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;. Since then many complex interchanges around the world have acquired the nickname.

Throughout North America, this type of interchange is widely referred to as a spaghetti junction, mixing bowl, knot, or maze, often including the name of the freeway, city, or notable landmark near enough to the interchange.

<text>Visual User Environment (VUE or HP VUE) is a discontinued desktop environment developed by Hewlett-Packard, intended for use on Unix workstations. VUE is based on the Motif widget toolkit and targets the X Window System.

VUE is a precursor to Common Desktop Environment (CDE), which was also based on Motif.

== History ==

Work began on VUE in 1988 at Apollo Computer for use with Domain/OS, as an alternative to Apollo&#x27;s standard DM and wmgr.

Shortly later, HP acquired Apollo, where they released the first version of VUE for Domain/OS, and then went on to modify VUE for use with HP-UX.

* VUE 1.0 – Released with Domain/OS SR10.4
* VUE 1.1
* VUE 2.0 – Released for HP-UX
* VUE 2.0.1
* VUE 3.0 – Released with HP-UX 9.0 in 1992

According to an article published in the &quot;Hewlett-Packard Journal&quot;, the look and feel of HP-VUE was used when developing the Common Desktop Environment (CDE):

After its release, HP endorsed CDE as the new standard desktop for Unix, and provided documentation and software for migrating VUE customizations to CDE.

<text>Xploding Plastix is a Norwegian electronic music duo, consisting of Jens Petter Nilsen and Hallvard Wennersberg Hagen.

== Biography ==

Jens Petter Nilsen and Hallvard Wennersberg Hagen (formerly in Norwegian black metal band Kvist) formed the group in early 1999, and submitted their first demotape in 2000. Their song, &quot;Treat Me Mean, I need the Reputation&quot; became an instant classic when it was released as a 7&quot; on Beatservice Records in 2000. It was later re-released in 2002 on Hospital Records and championed by LTJ Bukem, Coldcut, and Grooverider. Their first album, &quot;Amateur Girlfriends Go Proskirt Agents&quot;, was released in 2001 on Beatservice, and re-issued in 2004 by Palm Pictures.

Since the release of &quot;The Donca Matic Singalongs&quot; album in 2003, they have been busy working with music for short films, movies, and TV- and radio-productions. They have also collaborated with the Kronos Quartet who have performed their three movement composition, &quot;The Order on Things: Music for the Kronos Quartet&quot;. They have also worked in the collaboration project Piston Ltd who released the album Domestic Engine in 2007. They also have a side project, The Electones.

Xploding Plastix released a new album in September 2008 entitled &quot;Treated Timber Resists Rot&quot; on Beatservice Records. This was accompanied by a revisited re-release of &quot;The Donca Matic Singalongs&quot; which was not originally distributed outside of Scandinavia, and a new EP called &quot;Devious Dan&quot; featuring tracks from previous music videos.

<text>Hawkesley is an area of Birmingham, England. It is part of &#x27;The Three Estates&#x27;, the housing estates Hawkesley, Pool Farm, and Primrose. These are to the south of (and effectively sub-areas of) Kings Norton. The Ordnance Survey grid reference is SP0477.

Historically in Worcestershire, Hawkesley was an important area of action during the English Civil War particularly around Hawkesley Farm which is situated further towards Longbridge site of the famous motor works.

* Consisting of one act
* Utilising one to three characters
* Simple, if any, set design

==Etymology==
One possible origin of the genus name is the French &quot;scorzonère&quot; (&quot;viper&#x27;s grass&quot;).

== Secondary metabolites ==
Some &quot;Scorzonera&quot; species contain lactones, including members of the guaianolide class of sesquiterpene lactones. Flavonoids found in &quot;Scorzonera&quot; include apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin. Other secondary metabolites reported from the genus include caffeoylquinic acids, coumarins, lignans, stilbenoids, and triterpenoids. One unique class of stilbenoid derivative was first isolated from &quot;Scorzonera humilis&quot;. They were named the tyrolobibenzyls after Tyrol in the eastern Alps, where the plant was collected.

<doc id="844656" wikidata="Q1423091" url="?curid=844656" title="Cryptocoryne">
<text>Cryptocoryne is a genus of aquatic plants from the family Araceae. The genus is naturally distributed in tropical regions of India, Southeast Asia and New Guinea. The English common name &quot;water trumpet&quot; refers to their inflorescence, a spadix enclosed by a spathe (typical for the whole family), which resembles a trumpet. The genus is commonly referred to as to as Crypts by aquarium hobbyists.

The typical habitats of &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; are mostly streams and rivers with not too rapidly flowing water, in the lowland forest. They also live in seasonally inundated forest pools or on river banks submerged only at high water.

==Taxonomy==
===Taxonomic history===
The first &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; species was described in 1779 as &quot;Arum spirale&quot; by Retzius. The genus was described by Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer in 1828. However, the scientific classification of &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; species remains controversial.

===Relationship with other genera of Araceae===
&quot;Lagenandra&quot; is another genus closely related to the genus &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot;. The two can be easily told apart since the leaves of &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; species exhibit convolute vernation whereas &quot;Lagenandra&quot; species exhibit involute vernation.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;crypto&quot;, hidden, and &quot;koryne&quot;, meaning club. The common name (water trumpet) refers to the shape of its inflorescence, which is typical of the Araceae family.


== Cultivation and uses ==

Some &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; are popular commercially cultivated aquarium plants. Submerged plants reproduce vegetatively, emerse plants may flower and reproduce sexually. Many species are cultivated only by dedicated experts and are very hard to grow, or are not present in a culture at all. Some species are endangered because their natural habitats are disappearing. On the other hand, some water trumpets (e.g. &quot;Cryptocoryne beckettii&quot;) are very hardy aquarium plants, easy to grow to the point that they have become an invasive species after being introduced in Florida in North America.

Cryptocoryne is either found in peat bogs or on limestone; the latter do well in most aquaria, the former must have soft water to survive and need decomposing beech leaf litter to do well. &quot;C. striolata,&quot; while found primarily in peat bogs, has also been found growing on limestone. Borneo is home to many endemic crypts previously thought to grow only in tea-colored soft acid water emulating peat bogs but exploration of habitats from 2005 to 2010 showed about half grew on limestone as well. These hardwater &quot;Cryptocorynes&quot; are generally the easier ones to keep (in fact, some species, such as &quot;Cryptocoryne wendtii&quot; are said to be among the most versatile of aquarium plants); they tolerate low or bright light but grow faster in more intense light. This water plant&#x27;s range is around 12 to 33 °C, and slightly alkaline to neutral pH.

Plants of the genus &quot;Cryptocoryne&quot;, which range from India to New Guinea are found in very diverse conditions. Some are true acid loving plants such as &quot;C. pallidnerva&quot;, found in peat bogs in Borneo, while others such as &quot;C. crispatula var. balansae&quot; and &quot;C. pontiderifolia&quot; are found in streams with limestone beds—hard alkaline water. One species, &quot;C. ciliata&quot; is even found in semi-brackish water in some areas. It is one of the few aquarium plants that tolerates salt concentrations.

&quot;Cryptocoryne&quot; plants have been in cultivation in the aquarium hobby since the late 18th century, although it was not until the 1960s that more than a handful of species was known and became more common in the hobby. New species still regularly crop up as interest in these plants widens and more collecting expeditions by private parties are carried out.

== Crypt melt ==

A phenomenon often encountered when planting new crypts in an aquarium is commonly called &quot;Crypt melt&quot;, whereby the plant loses all its leaves. There seem to be two possible causes for this.

Rapid environmental change is thought to trigger this, as these plants do not seem to adapt well to transplantion, and may need 30 days or so to become established and for the leaves to regrow. Experienced growers report that it is better to plant crypts in aquariums that have been established for at least three months.

In the wild, crypts can grow fully submerged underwater, but in some plant nurseries they are often grown emersed and crypt melt could then be triggered by the change from emerse to submerse conditions.

There is lately a trend for such nurseries to send crypts as just a rootstock (i.e. without the leaves) to reduce shipping costs and because the leaves will be lost anyway once planted in an aquarium.

Other reports emphasise the need to change the aquarium water regularly to prevent the buildup of nitrates which are thought to trigger this condition (often referred to as a &quot;disease&quot;).

<text>Littleton Waller Tazewell (December 17, 1774May 6, 1860) was a Virginia lawyer, plantation owner, and politician who served as U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator and the 26th Governor of Virginia, as well as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates.

==Early and family life==
Tazewell, son of Henry Tazewell and his wife Dorothy Elizabeth Waller, was born in Williamsburg in the Colony of Virginia shortly before Christmas, 1774. His father was a clerk of the revolutionary conventions during the next two years. Although his mother died when he was a child, his maternal grandfather, lawyer Benjamin Waller, taught him Latin. Tazewell was privately tutored by John Wickham; he later graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary at Williamsburg in 1791. He married Ann Stratton Nivison Tazewell, and they had at least six daughters and two sons, although only four daughters would survive their mother.

==Career==
After studying law, Tazewell was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1796 and commenced practice in James City County, Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates (a part-time position) representing James City County from 1798 to 1800, when he resigned to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Marshall in the Sixth United States Congress, serving in the federal legislature from November 26, 1800, to March 4, 1801. Politically, Tazewell was a Jeffersonian Republican, and upon the fissure of that party he associated with the Jacksonian Democrats.

Tazewell moved to Norfolk, Virginia in 1802. He represented Norfolk Borough in the General Assemblies of 1804–1805 and 1805–1806 but was replaced by William Newsum, Jr. in the Assembly of 1806-1806. Nonetheless, on July 5, 1807, he defused the impressment crisis involving the British &quot;HMS Leopard&quot; in Norfolk harbor and the &quot;USS Chesapeake&quot; and Norfolk mayor Richard E. Lee. Tazewell again represented James City County in the House of Delegates from 1809 until 1812. Norfolk voters elected him to represent the Borough again in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1816 to 1817. After the War of 1812, Tazewell, General Taylor, George Newton, and others also formed the Roanoke Commercial Company, designed to expand traffic through the Dismal Swamp Canal and allow goods from as far away as mountainous Bedford County to ship through Norfolk. Tazewell also served as one of the commissioners of claims under the treaty with Spain, which ceded Florida in 1821.

Virginia legislators elected Tazewell in 1824 to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Taylor. Re-elected in 1829, he served from December 7, 1824, to July 16, 1832, when he resigned to become Virginia&#x27;s governor, as discussed below. While in the Senate, Tazewell was President pro tempore of the Senate during the Twenty-second United States Congress and chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. His principal published work is &quot;Review of the Negotiations between the United States and Great Britain Respecting the Commerce of the Two Countries&quot; (1829).
Tazewell served as Norfolk&#x27;s delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention in 1829–1830.

When the Whigs secured majorities in the Virginia Assembly for six years, they first elected the Old Republican as a Whig governor 1834–36. However, he resigned a year before his term ended. During his two years as governor, Tazewell had to address abolitionism. However, Nat Turner&#x27;s revolt had occurred in 1831 while Tazewell was home from Washington (and caused him to neglect his plantations). He became an advocate of wholesale colonization and, as Governor, asked Virginia&#x27;s legislature to formally request that Northern states suppress abolitionist groups and also asked Congress to suppress delivery of such literature through the U.S. Post Office. Tazewell&#x27;s governorship was also marked by an expansion of the James River Canal, which was to connect to the Kanawha Canal and thus the Ohio River. Under his leadership, the Assembly instructed Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senators to support internal improvements, protective tariffs, and a national bank supporting Henry Clay&#x27;s American System.

Following his term as governor, Tazewell retired from public life but received 11 electoral votes for vice-president in the election of 1840.

Tazewell owned plantations and enslaved persons in the Hampton Roads area. In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, his Norfolk household included nine free white people (5 his children) and a dozen enslaved people. Although Virginia state slave censuses are not available online, and several federal census returns appear either missing or digitally misindexed, by 1860, his household included nine enslaved people (3 men, 5 women, and one 2-year-old boy) in Norfolk, and over 100 enslaved people across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton County, Virginia (inherited through his wife).

==Death and legacy==
Governor Tazewell died a widower in Norfolk, Virginia, on May 6, 1860. Initially interred with his wife on his estate on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, he was re-interred in 1866 at Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk.

Tazewell, Virginia, Tazewell County, Virginia and Tazewell County, Illinois are named in his honor and his father&#x27;s honor, as are the cities of Tazewell and New Tazewell, Tennessee. A plaque remembering him stands at the corner of Tazewell and Granby streets in Norfolk, near the Tazewell Hotel and Suites, where his two-story house was located. His house, known as the Boush-Tazewell House, was completely dismantled and re-erected in its present location about three miles from its original site around 1902. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

Tazewell was the maternal grandfather of Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford, a prominent Virginia politician and a founder of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

A building at the College of William and Mary is named in Tazewell&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="844665" wikidata="Q13586570" url="?curid=844665" title="Lowsider">
<text>The lowsider or lowside is a type of motorcycle or bicycle crash usually occurring in a turn. It is caused when either the front or rear wheel slides out as a result of either too much braking into the corner, too much acceleration through or out of the corner, or too much speed carried into or through the corner for the available grip. It may also be caused by unexpected slippery or loose material (such as oil, water, dirt, gravel or leaves) on the road surface.

In the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia it is referred to as a &quot;lowside&quot; rather than a &quot;lowsider&quot;.

==Causes of lowsider crashes==

All horizontal forces occurring between the motorcycle and the road (such as accelerating, decelerating and steering) are transmitted by friction in the contact patches. There is a limited amount of force each contact patch can transmit before the tire begins to slide. Typically, the maximum force once sliding is slightly less than before sliding.

When travelling in a curve, the tires provide the centripetal force needed for the acceleration towards the center of the curve. The capsizing moment provided by gravity acting on the motorcycle&#x27;s center of mass when leaning into a corner is balanced by a righting moment generated by centripetal forces in the contact patches when all is working correctly. If, having reached a given lean angle, the centripetal forces are reduced then the motorcycle increases its angle of lean until it touches the road surface, usually unseating the rider in the process.

Lowsiders are caused by exceeding the lateral friction limit or by exceeding the combined lateral/longitudinal friction limit in one or more of the following ways:

* Braking force plus turning force exceeds friction available on either tire
* Turning forces exceed the friction available on either tire
* Acceleration force exceeds friction on the rear tire
* Bodywork or peg hitting a road surface lifts the bike causing less friction on either wheel
* Rapid deflation of one of the tires causes grip levels to reduce

Lowsider crashes are not usually caused by braking in a straight line in dry conditions. It is more likely that the rider will go over the handlebars through too much front wheel brake force or will lock the rear wheel resulting in a straight skid. The name derives from the fact that it is the low side of the motorcycle that hits the ground.

==Injury risks==

Riders are usually advised to do a lowsider rather than a highsider if neither can be avoided. The lowsider has the advantage of the motorcycle sliding before the rider, thus not threatening to crush them. Also, a lowsider tends to send the rider sliding across the road whereas a highsider is considered more severe as it violently throws the rider from the motorcycle with a higher probability of broken bones.

Laying down a bike can still result in significant injuries. When a bike is sliding on its side, the rider has no traction or control. The main injury risks are:

* Gravel rash due to sliding across the road surface at speed
* Hitting traffic coming in the opposing lane
* Impact injuries on the side the rider goes down (usually an elbow, shoulder or hip contusion, but the bike landing on an ankle can cause injuries, too)
* Hitting static objects on the side of the road such as street furniture or signage

<text>Kitts Green is an area of Birmingham, England, approximately 5 miles east of the city centre and on the borders of Tile Cross, Lea Village, Lea Hall, and Garretts Green. Historically in Worcestershire, close to the border with Warwickshire, Kitts Green dates back to when it was first mentioned in 1495 whereas Lea Village is first documented in 1275.

Kitts Green is served by services 14 (Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood via Alum Rock), service A9 from Kingshurst and Ilshaw Heath and service 72 from Chelmsley Wood to Solihull and service 97 from Birmingham to Chelmsley Wood via Bordesley Green. Services 14, 72 and 97 are operated by National Express West Midlands. Service A9 is operated by Stagecoach Midlands.

Roy Wood, co-founder of bands The Move, Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and Wizzard, was born in Kitts Green in 1946.

Kitts Green was the site of BSA&#x27;s research facility where David Garside developed the Norton Wankel rotary-engined motorcycles, such as the Norton Classic.

<doc id="844668" wikidata="Q769595" url="?curid=844668" title="Chalazion">
<text>A chalazion (; plural chalazia or chalazions) or meibomian cyst is not a cyst but a granuloma in the eyelid that results from a blocked meibomian gland. It typically occurs in the middle of the eyelid, red, and not painful. They tend to come on gradually over a few weeks.
A chalazion may occur following a stye or from hardened oils blocking the gland. The blocked gland is usually the meibomian gland, but can also be the gland of Zeis.

A stye and cellulitis may appear similar. A stye, however, is usually more sudden in onset, painful, and occurs at the edge of the eyelid. Cellulitis is also typically painful.
Treatment is initiated with warm compresses. In addition, antibiotic/corticosteroid eyedrops or ointment may be used. If this is not effective, injecting corticosteroids into the lesion may be tried. If large, incision and drainage may be recommended. While relatively common, the frequency of the condition is unknown. It is most common in people 30–50 years of age, and equally common in males and females. The term is .

==Signs and symptoms==

* Painless swelling on the eyelid
* Eyelid tenderness typically none-to-mild
* Increased tearing
* Heaviness of the eyelid
* Redness of conjunctiva

===Complications===
A large chalazion can cause astigmatism due to pressure on the cornea.

As laser eye surgery involves shaping the cornea by burning parts of it away, weakening its structure, post-operation people can be left predisposed to deformation of the cornea from small chalazia.

Complications of corticosteroid injection include hypopigmentation and fat atrophy which is less likely to occur in conjunctival approach of injection.

A chalazion that reoccurs in the same area may rarely be a symptom of sebaceous carcinoma.

==Diagnosis==

A chalazion or meibomian cyst can sometimes be mistaken for a stye.

===Differential diagnosis===
* Sebaceous gland adenoma
* Sebaceous gland carcinoma
* Sarcoid granuloma
* Foreign body granuloma

==Treatment==
===General treatment===
Chalazia will often disappear without further treatment within a few months, and virtually all will resorb within two years.

Healing can be facilitated by applying a moist warm compress to the affected eye for approximately 10–15 minutes, 4 times per day. This promotes opening, drainage, and healing by softening the hardened oil that is occluding the duct. In addition, it is helpful to scrub the lid margin (at the base of the eyelashes) with a washcloth and mild (baby) shampoo, which removes oily debris.

Topical antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g., chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) are sometimes used for the initial acute infection, but are otherwise of little value in treating a chalazion.
If they continue to enlarge or fail to settle within a few months, smaller lesions can be injected with a corticosteroid.

Larger ones can be surgically removed using local anesthesia. This is usually done from underneath the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin. If the chalazion is located directly under the eyelid&#x27;s outer tissue, however, an excision from above may be more advisable so as not to inflict any unnecessary damage on the lid itself. Eyelid epidermis usually mends well, without leaving any visible scar. Depending on the chalazion&#x27;s texture, the excision procedure varies: while fluid matter can easily be removed under minimal invasion, by merely puncturing the chalazion and exerting pressure upon the surrounding tissue, hardened matter usually necessitates a larger incision, through which it can be scraped out. Any residual matter should be metabolized in the course of the subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible hematoma around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. Chalazion excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional.

Chalazia may recur, and they will usually be biopsied to rule out the possibility of a tumour.

===Antibiotic/corticosteroid eyedrops or ointment ===

A limited course of topical antibiotic/corticosteroid combination eyedrops or ointment such as tobramycin/dexamethasone may be effective in treating a chalazion.

===Surgery===
Chalazion surgery is a simple procedure that is generally performed as a day operation, and the person does not need to remain in the hospital for further medical care. The eyelid is injected with a local anesthetic, a clamp is put on the eyelid, then the eyelid is turned over, an incision is made on the inside of the eyelid, and the chalazion is drained and scraped out with a curette. A scar on the upper lid can cause discomfort as some people feel the scar as they blink. As surgery damages healthy tissue (e.g., by scarring tissue or possibly even causing blepharitis), given other options, less invasive treatment is preferable.

Chalazion removal surgery is performed under local or general anesthesia. Commonly, general anesthesia is administered in children to make sure they stay still and no injury to the eye occurs. Local anesthesia is used in adults and it is applied with a small injection into the eyelid. The discomfort of the injection is minimized with the help of an anesthetic cream, which is applied locally.

The chalazion can be removed in two ways, depending on the size of cyst. Relatively small chalazia are removed through a small cut at the back of the eyelid. The surgeon lifts the eyelid to access the back of its surface and makes an incision of approximately 3mm just on top of the chalazion. The lump is then removed, and pressure is applied for a few minutes to stop any oozing of blood that may occur because of the operation. Surgery of small chalazia does not require stitches, as the cut is at the back of the eyelid and therefore the cut cannot be seen, and the cosmetic result is excellent.

Larger chalazia are removed through an incision in front of the eyelid. Larger chalazia usually push on the skin of the eyelid, and this is the main reason why doctors prefer removing them this way. The incision is not usually larger than 3mm and it is made on top of the chalazion. The lump is removed and then pressure is applied to the incision to prevent oozing. This type of surgery is closed with very fine stitches. They are hardly visible and are usually removed within a week after the surgery has been performed. Although chalazia are rarely dangerous, it is common to send the chalazion or part of it to a laboratory to screen for cancer.

When surgery for a chalazion is considered, people who take aspirin or any other blood-thinning medications are advised to stop taking them one week prior to the procedure as they may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.

In rare cases, people are kept overnight in the hospital after chalazion surgery. This includes cases in which complications occurred and the person needs to be closely monitored. In most cases, however, people are able to go home after the operation has ended.

The recovery process is easy and quite fast. Most people with chalazion experience some very minor discomfort in the eye, which can be easily controlled by taking painkilling medication. People are, however, recommended to avoid getting water in the eye for up to 10 days after surgery. They may wash, bathe, or shower, but they must be careful to keep the area dry and clean. Makeup may be worn after at least one month post-operatively. People are recommended to not wear contact lenses in the affected eye for at least eight weeks to prevent infections and potential complications.

Commonly, people receive eye drops to prevent infection and swelling in the eye and pain medication to help them cope with the pain and discomfort in the eyelid and eye. One can use paracetamol (acetominophen) rather than aspirin to control the pain. Also, after surgery, a pad and protective plastic shield are used to apply pressure on the eye in order to prevent leakage of blood after the operation; this may be removed 6 to 8 hours after the procedure.

People who undergo chalazion surgery are normally asked to visit their eye surgeon for post-op follow-up three to four weeks after surgery has been performed.

Chalazion surgery is a safe procedure and complications seldom occur. Serious complications that require another operation are also very rare. Among potential complications, there are infection, bleeding, or the recurrence of the chalazion.

===Steroid injection===
Because the inflammatory cells of chalazia are sensitive to steroids, intralesional or subcutaneous injection of soluble steroids, commonly 0.1 to 0.2 ml of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) into the lesion&#x27;s center one or two times, is one option. The success rate is in the 77% to 93% range. It carries a quite small risk of central retinal artery obstruction, focal depigmentation in dark-skinned patients, and inadvertent ocular penetration. It is considered a simple and effective treatment option, one with high success rates. It may give the same results as surgical treatment (I&amp;C). Larger, long-standing lesions are best treated surgically. Considering the surgical risks, steroid injection is believed to be a safer procedure in marginal lesions and lesions close to lacrimal punctum.

One injection alone has a success rate of about 80%; if requested, a second injection can be given 1–2 weeks later.

===Carbon dioxide laser===
Chalazion excision using a CO2 laser is also a safer procedure, with minimal bleeding and no eye patching required.

<text>The University of Antwerp () is a major Belgian university located in the city of Antwerp. The official abbreviation is &quot;UAntwerp&quot;. The University of Antwerp has about 20,000 students, which makes it the third-largest university in Flanders. The University of Antwerp is characterised by its high standards in education, internationally competitive research and entrepreneurial approach. It was founded in 2003 after the merger of three smaller universities.

==History==
===Origins===
The university&#x27;s roots go back to Sint-Ignatius Handelshogeschool (Saint-Ignatius School for Higher Education in Commerce) founded by the Jesuits (Society of Jesus) in Antwerp in 1852. This was one of the first European business schools to offer formal university degrees. It later opened a Faculty of Literature and Philosophy (including Law) and a Faculty of Political and Social Sciences. It was renamed Universitaire Faculteiten Sint-Ignatius Antwerpen (UFSIA)
in the 1960s when the Belgian government granted it university status. In the early 1970s UFSIA joined into a confederation with &quot;Rijksuniversitair Centrum Antwerpen&quot; (RUCA) and &quot;Universitaire Instelling Antwerpen&quot; (UIA), public institutions.

===Merger===
In 2003 UFSIA, RUCA, and UIA merged into the University of Antwerp to become the first explicitly pluralistic university in Belgium, offering philosophical, ethical, and spiritual discourse and openness towards religion and intercultural dialogue. It soon became the third largest university in Flanders with 20,000 students. In order to face the challenges posed by the internationalization of European education and research, the university is part of the Antwerp University Association (AUHA). The Catholic influence that the Jesuits had at UFSIA continues through the Saint Ignatius University Centre (UCSIA), Antwerp, founded in 2003.

In September 2020, the University of Antwerp chose to start the new academic year with stricter coronavirus measures than those recommended by the government.

==Faculties==
The University of Antwerp has 34 academic bachelor programmes, 83 master programmes, 26 master-after-master programmes and 21 postgraduates.

<text>Antioch is a neighborhood of Nashville located approximately southeast of Downtown Nashville. It is served by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The community known as Antioch began at the convergence of Antioch Pike, Hickory Hollow Parkway, Blue Hole Road, and Mt. View Road. The original town of Antioch began with a church located at Mill Creek in 1810. Antioch was a commuter town because workers traveled to and from downtown Nashville. From the beginning, the town provided immediate services like a post office and general store. For planning purposes, the community was given the name Antioch–Priest Lake because the study area encompassed areas near J. Percy Priest Lake and the neighborhoods that grew from the heart of Antioch in the early 19th century.

In 1810, the First Baptist Church was organized in the area near Mill Creek. Then in 1820, a large landowner by the name of Charles Hays donated land for the church to build on and began referring to it as the &quot;Church at Antioch,&quot; giving the village its name. Hays based the name change on a biblical passage, Acts 11:26 (KJV), which states &quot;... and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.&quot; Thus, the village was known as Antioch from 1820 onward. For a short time in the 1870s and 1880s, the post office designation for the village was Oneyville, named after the postmaster of that time, Dr. J. H. Oney. However, it was later changed back to Antioch.

Now a town featuring a post office, Antioch began to grow, covering an area of one to two miles in either direction. The Antioch mail route itself also covered additional areas outside of those communities. Beyond that initial two-mile boundary were the communities of Una, Mt. View, Cane Ridge, Tusculum, and Bakertown.

Much of the land in the town of Antioch was owned by Charles Hays, and he remained the largest landowner through the first few decades of Antioch&#x27;s existence. By the end of the 1840s, however, road construction had begun on Mill Creek Valley Pike (now known as Antioch Pike), and the road opened for use in 1846. Construction also began on a railroad that would change the face of the community.

The railroad built near the town of Antioch was vital for mail delivery and those workers who had jobs in the &quot;big city&quot; of Nashville. Even in those times, the commute to Downtown Nashville was a chore, requiring riding a horse to Nolensville Road, followed by a trolley that took a half day to get to Downtown. The first train helped workers get to and from Nashville quickly. In its heyday, approximately 18 passengers were taking the train to and from the city of Nashville per workday.

Over the years, there were four trains that ran both north and south that stopped at various station locations in Antioch. The first station was situated southwest of present day Una-Antioch Pike. The book &quot;With Good Will and Affection ... for Antioch&quot; states that this may be in the spot where Hickory Hollow Parkway runs today. In 1891, the train station would move to its second location near the terminus of Blue Hole Road at Antioch Pike. This was the final location prior to the arrival of the automobile. In later years, because of the increasing usage of the automobile, the railroad would remain in operation, but primarily for mail delivery.

Even though railroad usage was declining, the town of Antioch continued to grow through its local commerce. By the 1880s, the village consisted of a railroad station, one church, one store, a blacksmith shop, and a few residences.

=== 20th century ===
In the 1930s, an automobile repair shop and, later, a village pub would replace the blacksmith shop. Also in the area, local music teachers taught lessons out of a home on Mill Creek Valley Pike (Antioch Pike), and a two-story grocery store was owned and operated by a bachelor, Mr. Harris, who lived on the second floor of the premises. The post office remained as a community staple in the area and existed as part of the local grocery stores in subsequent years.

Over time, as Antioch continued to grow through suburbanization, it became more difficult to pinpoint where exactly Antioch was located. Having never formed as an incorporated city, the town of Antioch was mostly defined by its postal address. Identifying the community this way also proved difficult because the mail route was not confined to the small area around Blue Hole Road. A 1993 Nashville Scene magazine article titled &quot;An Antioch State of Mind&quot; reported that the Antioch post office grew to serve 14 rural routes and 11 urban routes. Despite the confusion about where Antioch started and stopped, people continued to be drawn to the area, and it saw significant growth in subsequent years.

In the 1970s, Antioch experienced explosive growth, largely due to the expansion of the Nashville sewer system to the area and the availability of large amounts of former farmland, which made possible the construction of many low-rise apartment complexes.

=== 21st century ===
The area continues to experience some of the highest growth rates in the Metropolitan Area of Nashville and Davidson County.

== Economy ==

The most important business concentration in Antioch is around the Commons at the Crossings, formerly Hickory Hollow Mall, which opened in 1978. As Hickory Hollow Mall, it was a regional shopping mall with a gross leasing area of , more than 140 stores, and 5,795 parking spaces.

In 2014, Oldacre McDonald LLC, co-developer of Nashville West, purchased of land in addition to the former Target site with plans to redevelop into a mixed-use space. Conn&#x27;s HomePlus and Floor &amp; Decor opened in the former Target location as the first retail tenants in the massive mixed-use project. Oldacre McDonald started work early in 2017, redeveloping the former Shoney&#x27;s property to house a medical office and retail building. This location is considered a gateway property to the Century Farms mixed-use development. Plans are being made to improve Hickory Hollow Parkway exit off I-24 to connect to the newly added Cane Ridge Parkway in the Oldacre development off Old Franklin Road.

Recently, there has been a fierce resurgence as the area redevelops to become Nashville&#x27;s second largest employment center. Community Health Systems is building a shared service center to employ over 2,000 people on part of a tract developed by Oldacre, McDonald LLC. Asurion, HCA Data Center, Drake Software, Tri-Star Physicians Plaza, Mac Papers, Brand Imaging Group, Calvary Logistics. Auto parts distributor LKQ Corp. (Nasdaq: LKQ) plans to invest $25 million in building a expanded regional office building in the Crossings Business District of Antioch in 2018. The duo of McArthur VanOsdale and Juan Vallarino, through their Nashville company V2 Capital, have paid $2.26 million for of land in Antioch primed for development that would include some combination of office buildings, a hotel and retail stores.
The former Hickory Hollow Mall Mall has been redeveloped and rebranded as the Commons at the Crossings. A combined state of the art library and recreation center now occupies the former JCPenney section of the mall. Nashville State Community College opened a southeast satellite campus at the former Dillard&#x27;s building. The community college now has grown to over 3,000 students. The community college partners with Middle Tennessee State University to offer simultaneous enrollment and degree-completion programs. The Nashville Predators chose the former Antioch mall location to construct its first regional ice hockey facility. The Ford Ice Center is home to the Olympic gold medalist Scott Hamilton&#x27;s Ice Skating Academy in addition to youth hockey play. Ford Ice Center has been operating at full capacity since its inception, making it one of the busiest rinks in North America. In addition to serving as a practice rink for the NHL Predators, the center also hosts collegiate hockey teams from Vanderbilt, David Lipscomb and MTSU. Most recently, Bridgestone North America moved to the redeveloped mall location housing its IT service center in the former Sears building and fully renovated the interior and updated the exterior. The struggling Global Mall at the Crossings occupies the interior of the old Hickory Hollow space. The State of Tennessee Department of Motor Vehicles placed a full-service driver license-testing station in Antioch. Metro greenway projects run along Mill Creek and plans are underway for a massive park space on land that had been purchased by the Metro Parks department near Cane Ridge High School.

Starwood Amphitheatre, Nashville&#x27;s former primary outdoor music venue, was located in Antioch, operating from 1986 to 2006. The amphitheatre closed prior to the 2007 season and has been demolished. Plans are in progress for a $100 million redevelopment project on the former Starwood site.

Antioch is the site of the denominational headquarters of the National Association of Free Will Baptists.

<text>Asleep at the Wheel is an American Western swing music group that was formed in Paw Paw, West Virginia, in 1970, and is based in Austin, Texas. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, released over 20 albums, and has charted more than 21 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. Their highest-charting single, &quot;The Letter That Johnny Walker Read&quot;, peaked at number 10 in 1975.

==History==
===Beginnings to Austin===
In 1969, Ray Benson and Lucky Oceans (Reuben Gosfield), both natives of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, co-founded Asleep at the Wheel in Paw Paw, West Virginia, and soon after they found themselves opening for Alice Cooper and Hot Tuna in Washington, DC. A year later, they moved to East Oakland, California, at the invitation of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. After being mentioned in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine by Van Morrison, they landed a record deal with United Artists. In 1973, their debut album, &quot;Comin&#x27; Right at Ya&quot;, was released by United Artists. At the invitation of Willie Nelson, they left Oakland for Austin in 1974.

===1974–1979===
In 1974, Asleep at the Wheel released its self-titled second album, with a cover of Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s first single to hit the country charts. The following year had the release of &quot;Texas Gold&quot;, with the top-10 country hit single &quot;The Letter That Johnny Walker Read&quot;. In addition, they played on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, where they have since performed a record-setting 10 times. In 1977, the band was voted Best Country Western Band by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and was awarded the Touring Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music. They also went on tour with Emmylou Harris in Europe. The following year, they recorded a cover of Count Basie&#x27;s song &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot;. Also in 1980, they appeared in the movie &quot;Roadie&quot;, along with Meat Loaf, Blondie, and Art Carney. By the end of the decade, the band recorded their first live album, &quot;Served Live&quot;, at the Austin Opera House.

===1980–1989===
The 1980s became a turbulent decade for the band. After moving to MCA, co-founder Lucky Oceans left, followed in September 1986 by Chris O&#x27;Connell due to her pregnancy. Asleep at the Wheel gathered a large amount of debt that required it to work on commercials and movie soundtracks. This band produced the soundtrack for the film &quot;Liar&#x27;s Moon&quot;.

In 1985, the band released a virtually ignored self-titled album. By the late 1980s, Ray Benson had done some producing, allowing the band a second chance with Epic Records. In 1987, the band released &quot;10&quot;, which won them their second Grammy for Best Country Instrumental, helping to launch their comeback. The album also had contributions from legendary fiddle player and onetime Texas Playboys member Johnny Gimble. The following year, the band released &quot;Western Standard Time&quot;, which won them another Grammy for Best Country Instrumental. The late 1980s also had the growth of Jann Browne as a solo vocalist in the group; she would later embark on a solo career on Curb Records.

===1990–1999===
The band moved to Arista Records and released the album, &quot;Keepin&#x27; Me Up Nights&quot;. Soon after, the band had turnover. Among its new members was former solo singer Rosie Flores, who joined in 1997. In 1991, Ray Benson directed the music and co-starred in the movie &quot;Wild Texas Wind&quot; with Dolly Parton. In honor of the 66th anniversary of Route 66, the band launched the &quot;Route 66 Tour&quot;. In 1993, the band released an instant hit with several guest musicians, &quot;A Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot;, to much critical acclaim. Two years later, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary by releasing &quot;The Wheel Keeps on Rollin&quot;. In 1999, the band and DreamWorks released &quot;Ride with Bob&quot;, as their second tribute album to Bob Wills. This album also enjoyed immediate success and garnered the band two Grammy wins, one for Best Country Instrumental, and the other for Best Package Design.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, Ray Benson &quot;didn&#x27;t just enlist the obvious Wills fans&quot; in this tribute album to Bob Wills like Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and Lyle Lovett. He also brought in some of country&#x27;s young lions the Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw, and Lee Ann Womack, some pop stars&quot;, including Shawn Colvin, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, and fellow country preservationists such as Dwight Yoakam.

===2000–present===
In 2000, the Dixie Chicks were nominated for an award for Vocal Event of the Year for &quot;Roly Poly&quot; with Asleep at the Wheel from the Country Music Association. That same year, the band toured with Bob Dylan and George Strait. Benson recorded a tribute to Wills and Texas swing music, including Dwight Yoakam, Vince Gill, Merle Haggard, the Dixie Chicks, and Willie Nelson. They were scheduled to play at the White House on the fateful September 11, 2001. In 2003, the band released &quot;Live at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas&quot;, and by the end of the decade, the band had released two more albums: &quot;Reinventing the Wheel&quot;, an entirely new set of songs, including a collaboration with The Blind Boys of Alabama, and a two-disc set &quot;Kings of Texas Swing&quot;. In 2007, their second Christmas album was released, &quot;Santa Loves to Boogie&quot;.

Asleep at the Wheel received six Austin Music Awards for their efforts in 2007, including Band of the Year, Songwriter of the Year (Benson), Country Band of the Year, Record Producer of the Year (Benson), Male Vocals of the Year (Benson), and Acoustic Guitar Player of the Year (McQueen).

In 2023, Katie Shore (vocals/fiddle) left the band for a solo career, but she still continues to sit in with the group on a semiregular basis.

<text>Melbourne tram route 72 is operated by Yarra Trams on the Melbourne tram network from Melbourne University to Camberwell. The 16.8 kilometre route is operated out of Malvern depot with Z and D class trams.

==History==
Route 72 was first allocated to the line between Camberwell (Burke Road) and the City (Swanston Street) on 1 November 1970. Prior to that, the line to Camberwell was serviced by route 7. The change was at first due to operations of the Camberwell line being shifted from Malvern depot to Camberwell depot. Even though the route was subsequently returned to Malvern in August 1979, the number 72 was kept. Before 1970, Route 72 was a short-working of the Wattle Park line, for trams that terminated at Riversdale instead of Wattle Park. Trams traditionally terminated at the Victoria Street terminus, but following an accident in 1991, trams instead terminated at the Queensberry Street crossover. Due to congestion during peak hours at the crossover, some trams continued north to Melbourne University. Finally on 17 January 1996, a permanent shunt was built at Melbourne University. From then on, route 72 trams were altered run full-time to Melbourne University.

The origins of route 72 lie in separate tram lines. The section of track between Queensberry Street (Stop 4) and Commercial Road (Stop 25) is the oldest section of this route, dating back to the Brighton Road cable tram which opened on 11 October 1888 by the Melbourne Tramway &amp; Omnibus Company. This cable tram line was electrified in stages by the Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board. The section between Domain Interchange (Stop 20) and Commercial Road was electrified on 27 December 1925. The section between Queensberry Street and City Road (near Stop 14) was electrified on the same day. The line between City Road and Domain Interchange was electrified on 24 January 1926. The Prahran &amp; Malvern Tramways Trust constructed the Malvern Road line between St Kilda Road and Gardiner (Stop 50) on 8 April 1915. This line was extended to Camberwell station (Stop 64) on 6 December 1917, and then to Cotham Road on 7 March 1918.

The route was curtailed for 21 months from March 1995 while a bridge was built over the Monash Freeway. In response to the State Government&#x27;s Melbourne 2030 planning policy, the Public Transport Users Association lobbied to extend route 72 north to Doncaster Road and Ivanhoe station, and south to Caulfield.

==Operation==
Route 72 is operated out of Malvern depot with Z and D class trams.

<text>Carter Glass (January 4, 1858 – May 28, 1946) was an American newspaper publisher and Democratic politician from Lynchburg, Virginia. He represented Virginia in both houses of Congress and served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Woodrow Wilson. He played a major role in the establishment of the U.S. financial regulatory system, helping to establish the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

After working as a newspaper editor and publisher, Glass won election to the Senate of Virginia in 1899. He was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, where he was an influential advocate for segregationist policies. Historian J. Douglas Smith described him as “the architect of disenfranchisement in the Old Dominion.” He also promoted progressive fiscal and regulatory reform but these contributions were often superficial since Glass generally opposed the most reformist aspects of federal legislation and was a New Deal critic. Glass won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1902 and became Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1913. Working with President Wilson, he passed the Federal Reserve Act, which established a central banking system for the United States. Glass served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1918 until 1920, when he accepted an appointment to represent Virginia in the United States Senate. Glass was a favorite son candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention.

Glass served in the Senate from 1920 until his death in 1946, becoming Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1933. He also served as president pro tempore of the Senate from 1941 to 1945. He co-sponsored the 1933 Banking Act, also known as the Glass–Steagall Act, which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and enforced the separation of investment banking firms and commercial banks. An ardent supporter of states&#x27; rights, Glass opposed much of the New Deal and clashed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over the control of federal appointments in Virginia.

==Early life and education==

Carter Glass was born on January 4, 1858, in Lynchburg, Virginia, the last child born to Robert Henry Glass and his first wife, the former Augusta Elizabeth Christian. His mother died on January 15, 1860, when Carter was only two years old, so his sister Nannie, ten years older (and Elizabeth&#x27;s only daughter), became his surrogate mother. Carter, a slight boy, got his nickname, &quot;Pluck&quot;, for his pugnacious willingness to stand up to bullies.

His father, Robert Henry Glass, was Lynchburg&#x27;s postmaster beginning in 1853, and in 1858 bought the &quot;Lynchburg Daily Republican&quot; newspaper (where he had worked since 1846). The city&#x27;s other newspaper was the &quot;Lynchburg Daily Virginian&quot;, then published by Joseph Button, who on June 23, 1860, (while R. H. Glass was out of town) died in a duel with Glass&#x27;s editor at the time, George W. Hardwicke, over accusations that Glass used his postal office to disadvantage the rival paper.

When the American Civil War (1861–1865) broke out, Lynchburg was pro-Union but also pro-slavery, since its economy depended on the manufacture of tobacco as well as slave-trading and the new railroads. R. H. Glass volunteered and joined the Virginia forces in 1861, and then joined the Confederate Army, where he became a major on the staff of Brigadier General John B. Floyd, a former Governor of Virginia. Major Glass ultimately remarried and had seven more children, including Meta Glass (president of Sweet Briar College) and Edward Christian Glass (Lynchburg&#x27;s school superintendent for five decades).

In poverty-stricken Virginia during the post-War period, Glass received only a basic education at a private school run by one-legged former Confederate Henry L. Daviess. However, his father kept an extensive library. He became an apprentice printer to his father (and Hardwicke) when he was 13 years old, and continued his education through reading Plato, Edmund Burke and William Shakespeare, among others who stimulated his lifelong intellectual interest. He thought that Shakespeare&#x27;s works were not written by William Shakespeare, refusing to accept that their author could have risen from humble origins. In 1876, Major Glass accepted an offer to edit the &quot;Petersburg News&quot;, and Carter joined him as a journeyman printer. Not long afterward, Major Glass accepted the editorship of the &quot;Danville Post&quot;, but Carter did not join him, instead returning to Lynchburg.

==Early career==
When Glass was 19 years old, he moved with his father to Petersburg. However, when young Glass could not find a job as a newspaper reporter in Petersburg, he returned to Lynchburg, and went to work for former Confederate General (and future U.S. Senator) William Mahone&#x27;s Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), which was in receivership from 1877 to 1880. Glass was a clerk in the auditor&#x27;s office at the railroad&#x27;s headquarters. Several years later, under new owners and with headquarters relocated to Roanoke, the railroad became the Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W). However, by then Glass had found the newspaper job he had initially wanted. His formative years as Virginia struggled to resolve a large pre-War debt (Mahone being a leading figure in the Readjuster Party) and dealing with boom-and-bust economic cycles (some linked with stock speculation), helped mold Glass&#x27; conservative fiscal thinking, much as it did many other Virginia political leaders of his era.
At the age of 22, Glass finally became a reporter, a job he had long sought, for the &quot;Lynchburg News&quot;. He rose to become the morning newspaper&#x27;s editor by 1887. The following year, the publisher retired and offered Glass an option to purchase the business. Desperate to find financial backing, Glass received the unexpected assistance from a relative who loaned him enough for a $100 down payment on the $13,000 deal. Free to write and publish whatever he wished, Glass wrote bold editorials and encouraged tougher reporting in the morning paper, which increased sales. Soon, Glass was able to acquire the afternoon &quot;Daily Advance&quot;, then to buy out the competing &quot;Daily Republican&quot;. Thus he became Lynchburg&#x27;s sole newspaper publisher; the modern-day &quot;Lynchburg News and Advance&quot; is the successor publication to his newspapers.

==Entry into politics==

As a prominent and respected newspaper editor, Glass often supported candidates who ran against Virginia&#x27;s Democrats of the post-Reconstruction period, who he felt were promoting bad fiscal policy. In 1896, the same year his father died, Glass attended the Democratic National Convention as a delegate, and heard William Jennings Bryan speak. Glass was elected to the Senate of Virginia in 1899, and was a delegate to the Virginia constitutional convention of 1901–1902. He was one of the most influential members of the convention, which instituted measures associated with the Progressive movement, such as the establishment of the State Corporation Commission to regulate railroads and other corporations, replacing the former Virginia Board of Public Works.

==Advocacy of segregation and disenfranchisement==

The 1902 Constitution required that to be eligible to vote a man prove that he had paid a poll tax of in each of the past three years, making voting a luxury. The Constitution also required that voters pass a literacy test with their performance graded by the registrar. When questioned as to whether these measures were potentially discriminatory, Glass exclaimed, &quot;Discrimination! Why that is exactly what we propose. To remove every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate.&quot; Indeed, the number of African-Americans qualified to vote dropped from 147,000 to 21,000 immediately. Carter Glass remained one of the strongest advocates of segregation and continued to dedicate much of his political career to the perpetuation of Jim Crow laws in the South.

==Congress, Secretary of the Treasury==


Glass was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1902, to fill a vacancy. In 1913, he became Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, where he worked with President Woodrow Wilson to pass the Glass-Owen Federal Reserve Act. In 1918, Wilson appointed him Secretary of the Treasury, succeeding William Gibbs McAdoo. His signature as Secretary of the Treasury can be found on series 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, issued while he was in office. At the 1920 Democratic National Convention Glass was nominated for President as a favorite son candidate from Virginia.

Glass served at the Treasury until 1920, when he was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Virginia&#x27;s senior senator, Thomas Staples Martin. Martin had been widely regarded as the head of Virginia&#x27;s Democratic Party, a role filled during the 1920s by Harry Flood Byrd of Winchester, another Virginia newspaperman who shared many of Glass&#x27;s political views and who headed the political machine of Conservative Democrats known as the Byrd Organization, which dominated Virginia&#x27;s politics until the 1960s. In 1933, Byrd became Virginia&#x27;s junior Senator, joining Glass in the Senate after former Governor and then-senior U.S. Senator Claude A. Swanson was appointed as U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President Franklin Roosevelt. Both Glass and Byrd were opposed to Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. Each was a strong supporter of fiscal conservatism and states&#x27; rights. Glass and Byrd invoked senatorial courtesy to defeat Roosevelt&#x27;s nomination of Floyd H. Roberts to a federal judgeship, as part of a broader conflict over control of federal patronage in Virginia.

Glass served in the U.S. Senate for the remainder of his life, turning down the offer of a new appointment as Secretary of the Treasury from President Roosevelt in 1933. When the Democrats regained control of the Senate that year, Glass became Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was President pro tempore from 1941 to 1945, being succeeded as such by Kenneth McKellar at the start of the custom of giving that post to the senior senator of the majority party. As a Senator, Glass&#x27;s most notable achievement was passage of the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated the activities of banks and securities brokers and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Glass, however, opposed the concept of bank deposit insurance and was “very unhappy” about this reform. A less successful minor legislative initiative from Glass was a 1930 resolution to ban dial telephones from the Senate, a measure that was successfully resisted by younger senators who favored dial telephony.

==Family, decline, death==

Carter Glass was a Methodist. When he was twenty-eight, Glass married Aurelia McDearmon Caldwell, a school teacher. They had four children. She died of a heart ailment in 1937. Glass remarried in 1940 at the age of 82. His second wife, Mary Scott, was his constant companion as his health began to fail over the next few years. They lived at the Mayflower Hotel Apartments in Washington, D.C. Starting in 1942, Glass began suffering from various age-related illnesses and could not attend Senate meetings after that time. However, he refused to resign from the Senate, despite many requests that he do so, and even kept his committee chairmanship. Many visitors were also kept away from him by his wife.

A confidential 1943 analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that Glass 

Glass died of congestive heart failure in Washington, D.C., on May 28, 1946. He is interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Lynchburg. His fellow sponsor of the Glass-Owen Act, Senator Robert Latham Owen, lies nearby.

==Legacy==

&quot;Montview&quot;, also known as the &quot;Carter Glass Mansion&quot;, was built in 1923 on his farm outside of the-then boundaries of Lynchburg in Campbell County. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now serves as a museum on the grounds of Liberty University. It lies within the expanded city limits of Lynchburg. The front lawn of &quot;Montview&quot; is the burial site of Dr. Jerry Falwell, founder of Liberty University.

The Virginia Department of Transportation&#x27;s Carter Glass Memorial Bridge was named in his honor in 1949. It carries the Lynchburg bypass of U.S. Route 29, the major north–south highway in the region, across the James River between Lynchburg and Amherst County.

A chair in the Department of Government was created in Glass&#x27;s honor at Sweet Briar College. It has been held by notable faculty including Dr. Barbara A. Perry.

An administrative building at Harvard Business School was named for Glass in the late 1920s. In 2020, the name Glass was removed from this building due to the efforts by Glass to &quot;strip Black citizens of their voting rights through means such as a poll tax and literacy test — efforts that intentionally disenfranchised Blacks and promulgated segregation, with pernicious and long-lasting effects.&quot; In a letter to the Harvard community, Dean Nitin Nohria said, &quot;We therefore cannot allow the Glass name to remain at the School.&quot; The building was renamed as Cash House, in honor of James Cash Jr., a distinguished Professor who served at Harvard for 36 years beginning in 1976.

Glass is one of the few Americans to appear on a U.S. coin during his lifetime. As a very prominent citizen of the city of Lynchburg, the 1936 Lynchburg Sesquicentennial commemorative half dollar has his image and name on the obverse. Only 20,000 were minted as they were not intended for regular circulation.

<text>Quentin George Keynes ( ; 17 June 1921 – 26 February 2003) was an explorer, writer, filmmaker, and bibliophile.

Keynes was born in London, the second son of Geoffrey Keynes and his wife Margaret, the daughter of George Howard Darwin who in turn was the son of Charles Darwin, making Keynes Darwin&#x27;s great-grandson. He was also the nephew of the economist, John Maynard Keynes. His older brother Richard was a physiologist, and younger brothers Milo and Stephen both writers.

Keynes moved to the United States in 1939. Shortly after the Second World War he started his life as an explorer of Africa and sub-equatorial islands of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. He made several films, and wrote several articles for the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. He was a member of the Roxburghe Club and collected books principally on the great explorers of the 19th century, but also travel, natural history, including rare and first editions of works by his grandfather Charles Darwin, and modern literature. His collection of rare books and manuscripts was sold by Christie&#x27;s in a series of four auctions in 2004.

A biography of him was published in 2004 by his nephew, the historian Simon Keynes.

<text>DutchBird was a charter airline based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It operated charter services to the Mediterranean, Egypt, Tunisia and the Canary Islands for a number of holiday companies. Its main base was Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.

==History==
The airline was established in 2000 and started operations on November 22, 2000. It was founded by Hans Mosselman, CEO of Sudtours Travel, and began operations with a Boeing 757 aircraft leased from Condor.

From 2001 to 2003, DutchBird was awarded “The best Dutch charter airline”. DutchBird&#x27;s special family oriented service included attractive extras for parents who traveled with children. Frequent passengers included conference members, symphony orchestras and footballers of AFC Ajax. DutchBird was the “Official Carrier of Ajax” since September 2002.

On November 25, 2004, ExelAviation Group attempted to purchase DutchBird, but was later cancelled.

All flights were stopped by December 2004 and the airline went under Dutch bankruptcy protection on January 27, 2005.

==Fleet==

The DutchBird fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

<text>Democratic Bahujan Samaj Morcha (Democratic Majority Society Front) was a political party in India, based in the state of Punjab. DBSM was formed in 1999 as a break-away from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in protest to the alliance of BSP with the Indian National Congress in the state. DBSM was led by Satnam Singh Kainth. DBSM allied themselves with Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 

In the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 DBSM put up Satnam Singh Kainth as a candidate in Phillaur in Punjab, backed by SAD-BJP. Kainth came second with 236 962 votes (38,61%).

In the state elections in Punjab in 2002 DBSM launched two candidates, backed by SAD-BJP, who got 23 664 (29,86%) and 10 372 votes (13,25%).

DBSM was reunified with BSP in 2004, but important sectors opposed the merger. Those broke away and formed Bharti Lok Lehar Party.

<text>In Irish mythology, Uaithne (, ) is Dagda&#x27;s harp, or rather the Dagda&#x27;s harper, according to a number of modern translators (cf. ).

==Attestations==
Úaithne figures as the name of Dagda&#x27;s harper captured by the Fomorians according to the narrative &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;Second Battle of Mag Tuired&quot;). After this battle, Dagda discovered his harp hanging on a wall, in a feasting-house wherein Bres and his father Elathan were also. The harp had two names, (&quot;Oak of Two Meadows&quot;) and (&quot;Four-Angled Music&quot; or perhaps rather &quot;Four-sided Rectitude&quot;). On this harp, the Dagda bound the music so that it would not sound until he would call to it by its names. After he called to it, it sprang from the wall of its own accord, came to the Dagda, and killed nine men on its way.

According to the (&quot;The Cattle-Raid of Fraech&quot;), Úaithne, the Dagda&#x27;s harper, had three sons by the Bóand of the &quot;síthe&quot;, and the three sons became harpers themselves, each being named after Úaithne&#x27;s musical strain, i.e., Goltraige (&quot;weeping-strain&quot;), Gentraige (&quot;laughing-strain&quot;) and Súantraige (&quot;sleeping-strain&quot;).

The &quot;TBF&quot; narrative further explains: &quot;The time the woman (Bóand) was at the bearing of children it had a cry of sorrow with the soreness of the pangs at first: it was smile and joy it played in the middle for the pleasure of bringing forth the two sons: it was a sleep of soothingness played the last son, on account of the heaviness of the birth, so that it is from him that the third of the music has been named&quot;.

==Etymology==
Úaithne presumably means &quot;Childbirth&quot;.

Úaithne is glossed as &quot;Orpheus&quot; in the Irish Glossaries. The word has multiple meanings beside Dagda&#x27;s harp.

Úaithne can also mean &quot;concord in music&quot; and Philippe Jouët endorses the interpretation that Dagda&#x27;s harp indeed means &quot;concordance&quot; or &quot;harmoniousness&quot;, which would be consistent with interpreting the byname as &quot;quadrangular harmony&quot;. Jouët also notes that since Uaithne (Uaitniu) could mean &quot;wood&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;pillar&quot; or &quot;harmony&quot;, those different meanings could be the consequence of successive metaphors.

==In popular culture ==
&quot;An Uaithne&quot; is also the original name of Irish choir Anúna.

Appears in the Symphogear anime series as a relic owned by Carol Malus Dienheim.

<doc id="844713" wikidata="Q738249" url="?curid=844713" title="National Front (French Resistance)">
<text>The National Front for an Independent France, better known simply as National Front ( or &quot;Front national de l&#x27;indépendance de la France&quot;) was a World War II French Resistance movement created to unite all of the resistance organizations together to fight the Nazi occupation forces and Vichy France under Marshall Pétain. 

Founded in 1941 in Paris by French Communist Party (PCF) members Jacques Duclos, André Pican, Pierre Villon, and their wives, they felt that all of the Resistance movements had to band together no matter their party or religion (Jewish or Catholic) to be a vital force against the Nazis, the collaborationists, and the informers. Its name was inspired by the Popular Front, a left-wing coalition that governed France from 1936 to 1938. This helped them coordinate attacks all across France; to move weapons, food, false identity papers, information and food; protect and move people who were to be arrested or executed; and supply multiple safe houses for the Resistance and for Jews. In 1942, they formed fighting units to assassinate German leaders and soldiers among the occupation forces; perform acts of sabotage on railroads and other transportation infrastructure being used to transport people and goods being taken from France to Germany; and to help organize sabotage in factories forced to produce armaments and goods for the German military.

== Political front of the FTP ==
The National Front (FN) was destined to be the &quot;political representative&quot; of the armed force called the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). It engaged mainly in propaganda, editing reviews, fabricating false identity documents, supporting clandestine organizations logistically, and sabotaging German and Vichy facilities and capabilities. It was a member of the Conseil national de la Résistance (CNR), which federated, under Jean Moulin&#x27;s authority, various Resistance movements, beginning in the middle of 1943.

Led by Pierre Villon, it then extended itself to Catholics and other religious resistants. Pierre Villon stated: &quot;The FN is the only movement where we have finally reconciled the parish priest (&quot;curé&quot;) and the teacher, the Parti Social Français and the Communist, and the Radical with the Socialist.&quot; Various specialized professional organizations were created under the authority of the Front National (the workers&#x27; Front National, the peasants&#x27; Front National, the lawyers&#x27; Front National, the doctors&#x27; Front National, the women&#x27;s Front National, etc.). After the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, in its issues of July 2 and July 7, wrote: &quot;Unite yourself, refuse to serve under fascism!&quot; At that time, the FTP armed wing had already been active since 1941, but the Resistance quickly expanded itself during 1942 and 1943. The French population&#x27;s morale improved as the difficulties faced by the Wehrmacht increased, in particular during the protracted Battle of Stalingrad. The 4 September 1942 Law on the STO (&quot;Service du travail obligatoire&quot;), signed by Pierre Laval, the head of government in the Vichy régime, proposed to exchange one prisoner-of-war for three Frenchmen to go to work in Nazi Germany. This was an important cause of the Resistance&#x27;s dramatic increase in numbers, inspiring many young male adults to stand up and volunteer for the Maquis.

At the time of the liberation of Paris, after the deportation and death of many of the members of the original clandestine leadership, the FN resistance movement counted such figures as Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Pierre Villon, Henri Wallon, Laurent Casanova, François Mauriac, and Louis Aragon among its members.

== Legal ownership of the name, &quot;Front National&quot; ==
A juridical battle between the far-right Front National and Bruno Mégret&#x27;s splinter party, the National Republican Movement (MNR), for the name, &quot;Front national,&quot; in December 1998 and January 1999, prompted the satirical newspaper, &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, to outrace both by deposing at the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI), the national institute in charge of trademarks, the term &quot;Front National,&quot; in order to give its juridical ownership back to the original Resistance movement of that name. Thus, the World War II resisters, the Front National, is once again the only movement legally entitled to be named &quot;Front National.&quot;.

== Publications ==

The National Front published numerous national and local clandestine newspapers and flyers.
From the spring of 1943 to the Liberation, 79 publications were published.
In 1944–1945 they published, according to an internal French Communist Party (PCF) source, &quot;Seventeen dailies, one million sales. three weeklies: &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; (Île-de-France), &quot;France d&#x27;abord&quot;, &quot;Action&quot;.

<text>&quot;Moxon&#x27;s Master&quot; is a short story by American writer Ambrose Bierce, which speculates on the nature of life and intelligence. It describes a chess-playing automaton that murders its creator. First published in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; on April 16, 1899, it is one of the first descriptions of a robot in English-language literature, though written well before the word &#x27;robot&#x27; came to be used. The story was included in the 1910 edition of the short story anthology &quot;Can Such Things Be?&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The master, Moxon, who creates a chess-playing automaton, boasts to the narrator that even though machines have no brains, they can still think and demonstrate intelligence or mind and therefore should be treated just like men of flesh and blood. After a thorough discussion about what it means to &quot;think&quot; and what is the nature of &quot;intelligence&quot;, the narrator leaves Moxon&#x27;s house in confusion. 

The narrator returns to Moxon&#x27;s house later in the midst of a rainstorm to learn more. He enters secretly and finds Moxon playing chess with an automaton. Moxon wins the game. This agitates the automaton who kills him in a fit of rage. Lightning strikes the room. The house is engulfed in flames. The narrator loses consciousness.

The narrator wakes up in a hospital room where Haley, Moxon&#x27;s servant, tells him that he saved him from imminent death. Haley corroborates the details. Nevertheless, the narrator questions whether what he saw was real.

==Analysis==

Moxon declares that intelligence is endemic in all inanimate and animate objects. This is a theory known as panpsychism. The ancient Greek philosopher Thales and William James espoused this view. Mind is inherent in all of the universe and in being.

The story alludes to Johann Maelzel&#x27;s chess player, an automaton who was able to challenge humans to chess matches. The device had been invented by Wolfgang von Kempelen. The &quot;red fez&quot; in the story is a reference to this figure, known as the Turk. Edgar Allan Poe had written an analysis of the chess-playing automaton in 1836, &quot;Maelzel&#x27;s Chess Player&quot;, offering an explanation of how the illusion was accomplished.

The main theme of the story is not only whether machines can think as we know it, but whether they can equal or even excel human beings. Can the automaton think because he has intelligence and can play a game developed by humans such as chess? Moxon argues that he can. Moreover, the automaton is angry and becomes homicidal after he loses. These are emotions typically ascribed to human beings. This is the unknown or X-Factor in the story. By thinking, does the automaton also acquire other traits, such as emotions? Like in humans, do these render the automaton as someone who has free will and who is unpredictable?

Finally, the title suggests that the automaton is the &quot;master&quot;, not Moxon. This raises the question of whether the automaton&#x27;s intelligence can potentially become superior to that of its maker, the human, Moxon. This is the future danger alluded to in the story. The automaton becomes the master of the man.

<text>Ormond Castle () is a castle on the River Suir on the east side of Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland. The oldest part of the existing castle is a mid-15th century walled bawn, cornered on the northeast and northwest by towers.

==History of Ormonde Castle==
Built before 1315, the original castle was acquired that year by the Butler Family after it was taken from the Wall Family. James Butler would eventually be granted the title 1st Earl of Ormond.

==The manor house==

Sometime after 1565, Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, spent many years at the court of his cousin through Anne Boleyn, Queen Elizabeth I. He carried from England a regard for Elizabethan-style architecture and added a Tudor manor house to the property, the first of its kind in Ireland. 

The manor house is also important to the Elizabethan-era martyrology of the strictly illegal and underground Catholic Church in Ireland. While staying in Ormonde Castle as a guest of Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, Archbishop Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, who would become one of the most celebrated of the 24 formally recognized Irish Catholic Martyrs, was met there by his former host, Baron Slane, in September 1583. The Baron explained the imminent danger to both himself and his family, and in return, the Archbishop voluntarily agreed to travel with him and surrender at Dublin Castle.

Meanwhile, despite his own militant Protestantism, the Earl of Ormonde was greatly offended and distressed at the trickery used in the arrest of a guest in his house. Afterward, he did everything he could in vain to rescue Archbishop O&#x27;Hurley from the executioners.

In the 17th century, the house was a favourite residence for James Butler, the &#x27;Great Duke of Ormonde&#x27;, but the Butlers abandoned the home after James&#x27; death in 1688. The home remained a possession of the Butler family until the mid-20th century. In 1947, the house was given over to Irish State agencies who restored the historic structures.

The mullioned windows on both floors enhance the manor house to the front and the oriel windows of the porch in the centre of the facade. The gallery on the first floor features two carved stone chimney piece, a ceiling, and frieze of Elizabethan plaster-work.

The U-shape of the manor house surrounds a small courtyard that abuts the north of the castle&#x27;s bawn. The manor has two floors and a gabled attic.

The most notable restoration achievement was the long gallery on the first floor of the facade, where the ceiling had largely collapsed. Once hung with tapestries, this room has a magnificent limestone fireplace bearing the date 1565 and has stucco representations of Queen Elizabeth flanked by Equity and Justice. It is said that she had promised her cousin that she would one day visit.

==Namesake in the United States==

<doc id="844724" wikidata="Q4394477" url="?curid=844724" title="Patricia Wrede">
<text>Patricia Collins Wrede (; born March 27, 1953) is an American author of fantasy literature. She is known for her &quot;Enchanted Forest Chronicles&quot; series for young adults, which was voted number 84 in NPR&#x27;s 100 Best-Ever Teen Novels list.

== Career ==
Wrede graduated from Carleton College in 1974 with a BA in biology and obtained an MBA from the University of Minnesota in 1977. She finished her first book in 1978 while working as an accountant and financial analyst.
She was a founding member of The Scribblies, along with Pamela Dean, Emma Bull, Will Shetterly, Steven Brust and Nate Bucklin, in January 1980, &quot;to which [she] belonged for five extremely productive years.&quot;
She sold her first book to Ace in April 1980 and it was published in 1982.
In the fall of 1980, Wrede met Lillian Stewart Carl, who introduced her to Lois McMaster Bujold.
In 1985, shortly before her fifth book was published, she became a full-time writer.
She is a member of the Liavek shared-world anthology.

In 2009, Wrede donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.

Lois McMaster Bujold credits the support of Wrede and Lillian Stewart Carl for allowing Bujold to finish her first novel: &quot;These friendships were lifelines in every sense&quot;.

==Personal life==
She was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 27, 1953, to David Merrill and Monica Marie Collins. She is the eldest of five siblings. As a child, Wrede was a voracious reader and recalls &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever read anything only once.&quot; She loved to tell stories to her family and friends and began writing in the seventh grade with much support from her parents. Patricia and James Wrede were married in 1976; they divorced in 1991. She is a pescatarian and lives in the Twin Cities with two cats.

==Books==

===Lyra===
These books are all stand alone stories that are loosely connected and share a common setting on a world named Lyra. They are listed here in order of publication. 
# &quot;Shadow Magic&quot; (1982)
# &quot;Daughter of Witches&quot; (1983)
# &quot;The Harp of Imach Thyssel&quot; (1985)
# &quot;Caught in Crystal&quot; (1987)
# &quot;The Raven Ring&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Shadows over Lyra&quot; (omnibus edition containing &quot;Shadow Magic,&quot; &quot;Daughter of Witches,&quot; and &quot;The Harp of Imach Thyssel&quot; as well as two shorter pieces titled &quot;Perspectives on Early Lyran History: A Monograph&quot; and &quot;Timeline of Lyran History&quot;) (1997) (Illustrated by Anne Yvonne Gilbert)

The actual chronological order of the books is &quot;Caught in Crystal&quot;, &quot;The Raven Ring&quot;, &quot;Shadow Magic&quot;, &quot;Daughter of Witches&quot;, and &quot;The Harp of Imach Thyssel&quot;. The last three are set in the same time period but different nations while the first two are spaced widely apart chronologically and happen well before the events of the last three. A timeline and short world history at the end of &quot;Shadows over Lyra&quot; ties everything together and answers a lot of questions.

The omnibus edition of &quot;Shadow Magic&quot; is a revised one; the writing is significantly different from that in the original, and reflects her greater experience as a writer. It seems that Wrede rewrote the story for the omnibus, but this is not actually noted anywhere in the book itself.

===The Enchanted Forest Chronicles===
This series features Princess Cimorene, as she becomes a dragon&#x27;s princess, rescues said dragon, falls in love, and ultimately saves the enchanted forest.

# &quot;Dealing with Dragons&quot; (1990)
# &quot;Searching for Dragons&quot; (1991)
# &quot;Calling on Dragons&quot; (1993)
# &quot;Talking to Dragons&quot; (1985, revised 1995)
* &quot;Enchanted Forest Chronicles&quot; (1995) (omnibus edition containing all four novels)

===Cecelia and Kate===
&quot;with Caroline Stevermer&quot;

The authors tell these stories from the first-person perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia (and, in the third book, two additional characters), who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. The first book is an epistolary novel. Unusually, it was written by the two authors exchanging letters with each other for the alternating sections, but never discussing the plot (the &quot;Letter Game&quot;).

# &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Correspondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality Regarding Various Magical Scandals in London and the Country&quot; (1988, reprinted 2003)
# &quot;The Grand Tour or The Purloined Coronation Regalia: Being a Revelation of Matters of High Confidentiality and Greatest Importance, Including Extracts from the Intimate Diary of a Noblewoman and the Sworn Testimony of a Lady of Quality&quot; (2004)
# &quot;The Mislaid Magician or Ten Years After: Being the Private Correspondence Between Two Prominent Families Regarding a Scandal Touching the Highest Levels of Government and the Security of the Realm&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Magic Below Stairs&quot; (2010). This installment was written by Caroline Stevermer alone and is set in the same universe. Although published in 2010, the events take place after &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; but before &quot;The Mislaid Magician&quot;. It follows the character of Frederick Lincoln as a child in the house of the Schofields.
* &quot;Magicians of Quality&quot; (2005) (omnibus edition containing &quot;Sorcery and Cecelia&quot; and &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;).

===Magic and Malice===
&quot;Mairelon&quot; is a gentleman wizard with unusual talents, and Kim is his streetwise protégée. Together, they foil plots and generally get into trouble. From a reference to the date being thirty years since the Terror, the novels take place about 1823, during the Regency era in its broader sense; however, the author has personally stated that the events of &quot;Magician&#x27;s Ward&quot; take place in 1818.
# &quot;Mairelon the Magician&quot; (1991)
# &quot;Magician&#x27;s Ward&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Magic &amp; Malice&quot; (1999) (hardcover omnibus edition containing both novels)
* &quot;A Matter of Magic&quot; (2010) (trade paperback omnibus edition containing both novels).

===Frontier Magic===
A trilogy narrated by Eff Rothmer, the &quot;thirteenth child&quot; of the opening book title. Book One covers her childhood, from the age of five (when her parents move west to the edge of the expanding American frontier) to shortly after her eighteenth birthday. Books Two and Three deal with an adult Eff&#x27;s work as an explorer, scientist, and magician beyond the edge of the frontier.

# &quot;Thirteenth Child&quot; (2009)
# &quot;Across the Great Barrier&quot; (2011)
# &quot;The Far West&quot; (2012)

===Others===
* &quot;The Seven Towers&quot; (1984)
* &quot;Snow White and Rose Red&quot; (1989)
* &quot;Book of Enchantments&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Star Wars, Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (Jr. Novelization) (1999)

* &quot;Star Wars, Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (Jr. Novelization) (2005)
* &quot;The Dark Lord&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2023)

&quot;The Seven Towers&quot; is a stand-alone fantasy novel. &quot;Snow White and Rose Red&quot; is a fairytale fantasy, being a retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Snow White and Rose Red&quot; (not &quot;Snow White&quot;) set in Elizabethan England, and including elements of the Thomas the Rhymer ballad as well.

<text>A balloon debate is a debate in which a number of speakers attempt to win the approval of an audience. The audience is invited to imagine that the speakers are flying in a hot-air balloon which is sinking and that someone must be thrown out if everyone is not to die.

Each speaker has to make the case why they should not be thrown out of the balloon to save the remainder. Typically each participant speaks on behalf of a famous person, profession, fictional character, etc. Other perilous situations may take the place of the sinking balloon, for example, a shipwrecked raft, or a nuclear bunker. 

The balloon debate style appears in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality television series where contestants must make a case for them not being thrown out.

It is often used to build argumentative skills in preparation for Speech and Debate activities such as public forum, policy debate and Lincoln-Douglas.

<text>Compton is a suburb of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. It is located to the west of Wolverhampton city centre on the A454, within the Tettenhall Wightwick ward.

== History ==
Compton sits nestled below the ridge that stretches south west from Aldersley, with some of its housing climbing the steep hill near &#x27;The Holloway&#x27; on the climb towards Tettenhall Wood. Across the Smestow valley the terrain rises again in the direction of Finchfield. The valley here through which the Smestow Brook flows was formed as a glacial meltwater channel. The area was quarried for its sandstone.

Its place name reflects its position - first recorded in the Domesday book of 1086 as &#x27;Contone&#x27;, from Old English &quot;cumb&quot; - a narrow valley or deep hollow (&#x27;cumb&#x27; is likely a continuation in use or a loan word from Brythonic &quot;cwm&quot; (Welsh) or &quot;cum&quot; (Cornish), meaning &#x27;valley&#x27;), and Old English &quot;tūn&quot; - a farmstead or fenced place.

Compton Lock on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal was the starting point in 1766 for the construction of the canal under James Brindley.

In the late 19th-early 20th century, Compton was home of a distinguished local artist Joseph Vickers de Ville (1856–1925). It was during this time that the still-existing terraced housing was built along Henwood Road near the Bridgnorth Road junction.

== Today ==
 Today, the quarrying has stopped, and housing estates have been constructed along the side of the valley. Much of the area was built in the latter half of the 20th century, though Compton does retain some of its older buildings such as several houses on The Holloway.
At present, Compton Park campus is one of two Business Schools of the University of Wolverhampton; the other is in Telford.
The Sir Jack Hayward Training Ground of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club is in Compton Park.

Next to the Sir Jack Hayward training ground is St Edmund&#x27;s Catholic Academy and opposite is St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Academy.

Compton has several shops, take-aways, restaurants and pubs. The nearest railway station today is Wolverhampton but Compton had its own station, Compton Halt, on the Wombourne Branch Line from 1925 - 1932. The line remained open for freight until closure in 1965. The line now forms part of a railway walk.
Compton has a frequent bus service 10/10A connecting Compton with Perton and Wolverhampton while less direct services 62/62A connect to Wolverhampton via Tettenhall and Dunstall Hill. These services are operated by National Express West Midlands while Arriva Midlands service 9 operates hourly Mon-Sat between Wolverhampton and Bridgnorth.

<doc id="844733" wikidata="Q1319725" url="?curid=844733" title="Sex verification in sports">
<text>Sex verification in sports (also known as gender verification, or as gender determination or a sex test) occurs because eligibility of athletes to compete is restricted whenever sporting events are limited to a single sex, which is generally the case, as well as when events are limited to mixed-sex teams of defined composition (e.g., most &quot;pairs&quot; events). Practice has varied tremendously over time, across borders and by competitive level. Issues have arisen multiple times in the Olympic games and other high-profile sporting competitions, for example allegations that certain male athletes attempted to compete as women or that certain female athletes had intersex conditions perceived to give unfair advantage. The topic of sex verification is related to the more recent question of how to treat transgender people in sports. Sex verification is not typically conducted on athletes competing in the male category because there is generally no perceived competitive advantage for a female or intersex athlete to compete in male categories.

Sex verification in sports began in the 1940s with &quot;femininity certificates&quot; provided by a physician. It subsequently evolved into visual inspections, physical examinations, chromosome testing, and later testosterone level testing. These tests were all designed to ensure that athletes were only allowed to compete as their sex, but mostly resulted in the exclusion of intersex athletes from female sports. Mandatory sex verification testing was fueled by anxieties surrounding the &quot;unfemininity&quot; of some female athletes, as more participated in historically &quot;masculine&quot; events (e.g., track and field).

Sex verification can be substantially more complicated than checking whether a person&#x27;s sex chromosome &quot;pair&quot; is XX vs. XY, or comparing their levels of key sex hormones to distinct reference ranges, to determine an athlete&#x27;s sex. This is due to variations in human biology where some people are not unambiguously female or male, not all cells in a person&#x27;s body have the same genotype or the presence of other atypical genetic condition. These reasons, among others, led sporting bodies to abandon chromosome testing towards the end of the 20th century and use hormone testing instead. The downside of hormone testing, however, is that policies on hyperandrogenism (women with naturally higher testosterone) were required, which have sparked both public debate and legal battles.

==History==

From 1946 to 1966, national sporting associations conducted sex verification testing. The first mandatory sex test issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world&#x27;s track and field governing body, for woman athletes was in July 1950 in the month before the European Championships in Belgium. All athletes were tested in their own countries. The IAAF instituted sex testing at the actual games, starting at the 1966 European Athletics Championships in response to suspicion that several female athletes from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were actually men. At the Olympics, testing was introduced in 1968. Subsequent reports have shown that the tests could cause psychological harm. &quot;Sex verification&quot;—identifying athletes whose hormone levels are abnormal compared to others of their &quot;purported&quot; sex — can cause sex identity crises, elicit demeaning reactions (publicly and privately), isolate athletes socially, and lead to depression and sometimes suicide.

=== Physical examinations ===
Future IOC president Avery Brundage requested, during or shortly after the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, that a system be established to examine female athletes. According to a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article about intersex people, Brundage felt the need to clarify &quot;sex ambiguities&quot; after observing the performance of Czechoslovak runner and jumper Zdeňka Koubková and English shotputter and javelin thrower Mary Edith Louise Weston. Both individuals later had gender reassignment surgery and legally changed their names, to Zdeněk Koubek and Mark Weston, respectively.

Sex verification tests began in 1950 with the IAAF, using physical examinations. &quot;Sex segregation and verification are mutually interdependent because, if there were no claims or basis for having separate male and female sporting events, there would be no need for sex verification testing.&quot; Initially, women athletes &quot;were asked to parade nude before a panel of doctors&quot;. For a period of time these tests were mandatory for female athletes, due to fears that male athletes would pose as female athletes and have an unfair advantage over their competitors. Additionally, fears increased in the mid-20th Century about female athletes not being &quot;true&quot; women as it became more acceptable for women to compete in sporting events.

At the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, the IAAF required that all female athletes undergo a gynaecological examination to confirm they possessed female genitalia. Two weeks later, at the 1966 European Athletics Championships, they conducted visual examinations. This process was deemed the &quot;nude parade&quot; and many athletes reported feeling humiliated by these procedures. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) never adopted these methods.

===Chromosome testing===

From 1958 to 1992, all female athletes underwent mandatory sex verification tests before taking part in any IAAF or IOC event. Barr body tests were conducted by taking samples from inside the cheek to find evidence of XX chromosomes, supposedly indicating the athlete was female. This test was first conducted by the IAAF in 1967 at the European Cup Track and Field event in Kiev, Soviet Union. Those who passed the tests and verified as females were provided femininity certificates which they could use at all future international competitions. Compulsory sex verification tests were commonplace and not many female athletes questioned the practice until the late 1980s.

Chromosome testing was criticized by scientists, such as de la Chapelle, Ferguson-Smith, Ferris, Ljungqvist, and Simpson. They, among others, argued the Barr body test did not take into account gonadal, morphological, and psychological sex attributes. Ultimately, a central contention was whether a Y chromosome yields a competitive advantage because it is not always accompanied by &quot;manly&quot; attributes that provide greater strength, power, or flexibility.

In 1985, runner Maria José Martínez-Patiño failed her sex verification at the World University Games in Kobe, Japan, after passing the test at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics. Martínez-Patiño was told to retire discreetly due to her results, which was commonplace among athletes who failed gender verification tests. However, she refused to retire, leading to immense public scrutiny.

Finnish geneticist Albert de la Chapelle worked alongside Martínez-Patiño to appeal the decision to the IAAF. De la Chapelle protested sex testing in sports for years, arguing that the Barr body test incorrectly identified intersex women. Furthermore, he pointed out that the finding of the abnormal sex chromatin and exclusion of these athletes from women&#x27;s sporting events violated their rights and caused psychological damage. With de la Chapelle&#x27;s support, the IAAF reinstated Martínez-Patiño in 1988. Martínez-Patiño&#x27;s case, and later advocacy, led to the elimination of chromosomal sex verification tests.

This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness. The International Association of Athletics Federations ceased sex screening for all athletes in 1992, but retained the option of assessing the sex of a participant should suspicions arise. As well, in 1992, the IOC continued compulsory sex verification, but switched from the Barr body test to a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to look for &quot;male-related genetic material&quot; through DNA samples collected from a buccal swab. This test was still subject to criticism and several medical associations opposed gender verification by the late 1990s. A resolution was passed at the 1996 International Olympic Committee (IOC) World Conference on Women and Health &quot;to discontinue the current process of gender verification during the Olympic Games&quot;. The International Olympic Committee&#x27;s board voted to discontinue the practice in June 1999. Chromosome testing was last performed at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.

=== Hormone testing ===

In 2006, the IAAF published a new Policy on Gender Verification. This allowed the organization to subject athletes to medical examinations by gynaecologists, endocrinologists, psychologists, internal medicine specialists, and experts on gender/transgender issues if suspicions arose of the athlete&#x27;s gender. The IAAF clarified the sex determinations would not be made on the sole basis of laboratory-based results. Athletes were provided with the option to undergo medical and surgical procedures to compete if they had failed the gender verification testing. Furthermore, the 2006 Policy listed conditions that would not provide advantages over other females, thus allowing the athlete to compete. These included: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), Gonadal dysgenesis, Turner&#x27;s Syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen producing tumours, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

In August 2009, South African athlete Caster Semenya was subjected to mandatory sex verification testing at the request of the IAAF. In the wake of the Semenya case, testosterone testing was introduced to identify cases where testosterone levels were elevated above a particular level, termed hyperandrogenism, with national Olympics committees tasked by the IOC to &quot;actively investigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics&quot;.

In 2011, the IAAF released new protocols related to testosterone and hormone testing. The protocols rejected the terms &quot;sex testing&quot; and &quot;gender verification&quot; and placed emphasized importance on testosterone levels, as certain athletes would not be eligible to compete in the female category due to hormonal characteristics. The protocols claimed that hormone levels indicated the differences in athletic performance between men and women. Investigations under the protocol were prompted by suspicion and carried out through endocrinological blood tests. These tests determined whether androgen levels were below the male range of 10 nmol/L. If the athlete was over that level, more tests would be carried out to determine if she had androgen resistance, which means she would not have a competitive advantage. If the athlete was found to have a competitive advantage, under this protocol, she was ineligible to compete until undergoing IAAF-recommended treatment.

In association football, FIFA&#x27;s current gender verification policy dates to 30 May 2011. In June 2012, in advance of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the IOC released &quot;IOC Regulations on Female Hyperandrogenism&quot; to address these cases. It includes the statement:&quot;Nothing in these Regulations is intended to make any determination of sex. Instead, these Regulations are designed to identify circumstances in which a particular athlete will not be eligible (by reason of hormonal characteristics) to participate in 2012 Olympic Games (OG) Competitions in the female category. In the event that the athlete has been declared ineligible to compete in the female category, the athlete may be eligible to compete as a male athlete, if the athlete qualifies for the male event of the sport.&quot;Policies on hyperandrogenism were suspended following the case of &quot;Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) &amp; The International Association of Athletics Federations&quot;, in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, decided in July 2015. Chand had been dropped from the 2014 Commonwealth Games at the last minute after the Athletic Federation of India stated that hyperandrogenism made her ineligible to compete as a female athlete. The ruling found that there was insufficient evidence that testosterone increased female athletic performance. In doing so the court immediately suspended the practice of hyperandrogenism regulation used by the IAAF and declared it void unless the organization could present better evidence by July 2017.

A study published in 2017 by Stéphane Bermon and Pierre-Yves Garnier analyzed 2,127 performances and hormone concentrations in male and female elite track and field athletes during the 2011 and 2013 Track and Field World Championships. When compared with women with lower levels of the hormone free testosterone (fT), women with the highest fT levels performed significantly better in the 400 m, 400 m hurdles, 800 m, hammer throw, and pole vault with margins of 2.73%, 2.78%, 1.78%, 4.53%, and 2.94%, respectively. Such a pattern was not found in any of the male athletic events. The study concluded that female athletes with high testosterone levels have a significant competitive advantage over those with low fT in 400 m, 400 m hurdles, 800 m, hammer throw, and pole vault.

====Criticism====
Scholars question whether any advantage should be considered &quot;unfair&quot; if it occurs naturally and outside the control of the athlete. For example, elite athletes have greater aerobic capacity and endurance in comparison to the general population. Furthermore, these cases have elicited criticism of the elite sporting system by showing clear vulnerability of women athletes to unnecessary medical interventions under duress, applied even though there was no evidence of cheating and no evidence of athletic advantage. Moreover, the requirement to lower testosterone levels can have adverse impacts on athletes&#x27; health, as side effects may include: excessive thirst, urination and electrolyte imbalances, disruption of carbohydrate metabolism, headache, fatigue, nausea, hot flushes, and liver toxicity. Other commentators question the causal connection between testosterone and athletic capability, as some women who have high testosterone are prone to biological characteristics, such as obesity and short stature, that adversely impact athletic ability. As well, other factors, such as mitochondrial variations, acromegaly, a complete and balanced diet, and access to high level training at an early age, are said to be as relevant as testosterone, but are not considered.

As with previous forms of sex testing, testosterone testing has been regarded by many as humiliating, unnecessary, unethical, and discriminatory. Katrina Karkazis, Rebecca Jordan-Young, Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that the new IAAF policies on hyperandrogenism in female athletes will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify &quot;gender policing&quot;. In fact, high-performing female athletes show a rate of complete AIS much higher than the general population—which shows 1 in 20,000–50,000, compared with elite athletes&#x27; 1 in 429. They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender.

In November 2015, the IOC held a meeting to address both its hyperandrogenism and transgender policies. In regards to hyperandrogenism in female athletes, the IOC encouraged reinstatement of the IAAF policies suspended by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It also repeated an earlier policy statement that, to &quot;avoid discrimination, if not eligible for female competition the athlete should be eligible to compete in male competition&quot;. In February 2016, it was made known that the IOC would not introduce its own policies that would impose a maximum testosterone level for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

The cases of Dutee Chand and Caster Semenya were widely reported during the 2016 Rio Olympics. Immediately preceding the games, Genel, Simpson and de la Chapelle were again published in &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; stating:

====New rules in 2018==== 
On November 1 of 2018 the IAAF adopted new criteria regarding &quot;Differences of Sexual Development&quot; for female athletes competing in the following races: 400 m, 800 m, 1 mile, hurdles, and events that include a combination of these distances.

Athletes with testosterone levels equalling or exceeding 5 nmol/L or who are &quot;androgen sensitive&quot; and want to participate in above-mentioned events at the global level (including recognition for setting an international record) must legally be female or intersex, must get their testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L for six consecutive months and must ensure their levels stay below this level. This new regulation replaced all previous rules implemented regarding women with hyperandrogenism.

====Medical opposition====
The World Medical Association (WMA) demanded the withdrawal of these regulations arguing that they discriminate based on gender variation of female athletes. The Association also expressed concerns with physicians treating athletes with high levels of endogenous testosterone when the condition is not pathological.

=== Hormone testing in post-secondary education ===
In 2011, the NCAA made a statement of inclusivity for Transgender athletes competing in college athletics. Through this statement, the NCAA was able to structure an implementation plan for transgender athletes to participate in college sports, and some policies that would ensure an equitable opportunity for every athlete. The following are the specific guidelines for transgender athletes incorporated into the NCAA in 2011:1. A trans male (FTM) student-athlete who has received a medical exception for treatment with testosterone for diagnosed Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for purposes of NCAA competition may compete on a men&#x27;s team, but is no longer eligible to compete on a women&#x27;s team without changing that team status to a mixed team.

2. A trans female (MTF) student-athlete being treated with testosterone suppression medication for Gender Identity Disorder or gender dysphoria and/or Transsexualism, for the purposes of NCAA competition may continue to compete on a men&#x27;s team but may not compete on a women&#x27;s team without changing it to a mixed team status until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment.In 2021, however, the NCAA adjusted the previous policy of requiring one calendar year of testosterone suppressing therapy for transgender female athletes. Instead, now there is more frequent testosterone testing. The following passage describes these additional requirements:Starting with the 2022-23 academic year, transgender student-athletes will need documented levels at the beginning of their season and a second documentation six months after the first. They will also need documented testosterone levels four weeks before championship selections. Full implementation would begin with the 2023-24 academic year.More frequent hormone testing is seen in the IOC policy for sex verification. The motives behind these new implementations, according to the NCAA, is so that there is &quot;consistency and further strengthens the relationship between college sports and U.S. Olympics&quot;.

Overall, the topic and policies of transgender athletes in post secondary sports is highly controversial. The amount of open transgender athletes competing in college athletics in the United States is extremely small, as only 32 athletes are reportedly transgender. But some of these specific examples grab the public&#x27;s attention.

===20th century===
* Perhaps the earliest known case is that of Stanisława Walasiewicz (aka Stella Walsh), a Polish athlete who won a gold medal in the women&#x27;s 100 m at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but who after her death in 1980 was discovered to have had partially developed male genitalia.
* Before the advent of sexual verification tests, German athlete Dora Ratjen competed in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin and placed fourth in the women&#x27;s high jump. Ratjen later competed and set a world record for the women&#x27;s high jump at the 1938 European Championships before tests by the German police concluded that Ratjen was a man. Ratjen was likely an intersex individual, based on the physician&#x27;s description who conducted the examination. Though raised as a girl, Ratjen later took the name Heinrich Ratjen following an official registry change. This case played a great role in being the first sparking public interest in Sex Verification and the gender of athletes. Some speculate that the need for Ratjen&#x27;s sex verification resulted from them competing for Germany when it was under the rule of Nazis - and Ratjen was forced to compete as a woman to ensure an Olympic medal for the nation.
* Other cases of sex verification at the 1936 Olympic Games involved track athletes Helen Stephens (U.S) and Stella Walsh (Poland), winning gold and silver in the 100m, respectively. Both displayed body characteristics that reflected the male body and were forced to participate in a physical exam. The tests resulted in only Stephens being identified as a male. 
* In the 1940s, all female athletes competing in top levels of their sports were then required to provide evidence of their sex by submitting a medical certificate prior to their competition.
* The Dutch sprinter Foekje Dillema was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in July 1950; later investigations revealed a Y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she probably was a 46,XX/46,XY mosaic female.
* Sisters Tamara and Irina Press won five track and field Olympic gold medals for the Soviet Union and set 26 world records in the 1960s. They abruptly ended their careers before the introduction of gender testing in 1966. Although both sisters were alleged to have been men or intersex, there is no evidence of an intersex condition in these cases.
* Polish athlete Ewa Kłobukowska, who won the gold medal in women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay and the bronze medal in women&#x27;s 100 m sprint at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, is the first athlete to fail a gender test in 1967. She was found to have the rare genetic condition of XX/XXY mosaicism and was banned from competing in Olympic and professional sports.
* In 1967 the IOC disqualified the Austrian 1966 Female World Champion in downhill skiing, Erik Schinegger (then named Erika), from the 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble after determining Schinegger had internal male sex organs. Schinegger later transitioned to male.
* In 1986, Spanish hurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño was dismissed and publicly shamed after failing a chromosomal test. She fought the ruling against her, arguing that she could not have a competitive advantage because her intersex variation resulted in her having no functional testosterone. Two years later, the IAAF gave Martínez-Patiño the green light to compete again. Her plight brought attention to the issue of gender testing, which helped lead to the end of mandatory tests a decade later.
===21st century===
* In 2001, Indian athlete and swimmer Pratima Gaonkar committed suicide after disclosure and public commentary on her failed sex verification test.
*Indian middle-distance runner Santhi Soundarajan, who won the silver medal in 800 m at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, failed the sex verification test and subsequently stripped of her medal; leading her to attempt suicide.
*South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won the 800 meters at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin. After her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. The IAAF confirmed that Semenya had agreed to a sex-testing process that began in South Africa and would continue in Germany. On 6 July 2010, the IAAF confirmed that Semenya was cleared to continue competing as a woman. The results of the gender testing were never officially released for privacy reasons. In 2018, the IAAF announced new rules that once again prevented Semenya from running. This included lowering the allowable level of testosterone from 10nmol/L to 5nmol/L.
* In 2012, after female Indian track athlete Pinki Pramanik was accused by a female roommate of rape and later charged, she was gender tested and declared a male although she and other medical experts dispute the claims. Pramanik disagreed with these results and police ordered a separate government-led test as part of the trial. The SSKM Government Hospital declared the results to be inconclusive. The Court then directed a chromosome pattern test.
* Four unnamed women athletes from poor rural regions, were screened and identified with DSD in France. They were given treatment for DSD and gender related surgeries to normalize them more with their identity (including a gonadectomy and optional surgery that did not impact requirements to compete as female) The female athletes were discovered to have an undiagnosed intersex trait during testosterone testing; the case was first published in 2013.
*Dutee Chand was dropped from the 2014 Commonwealth Games at the last minute after the Athletic Federation of India stated that hyperandrogenism made her ineligible to compete as a female athlete. Chand took a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and won an interim judgment in mid-2015. In February 2016, it was made known that the IOC would not impose a maximum testosterone level for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In June 2016, Chand qualified to compete in the 100 metres race at the Summer Olympics. Notably, all three medalists in the women&#x27;s 800 m showed intersex characteristics, the 4th, 5th, and 6th placers expressed disappointment and concern.
* In 2018, Caster Semenya brought criticisms from the WMA against the IAAF to the CAS. The Court upheld the IAAF&#x27;s new regulations, as they deemed the differential treatment proportionate. The CAS stated the treatments the relevant athletes must undergo did not outweigh the objective of protecting fair competition in the female category.
* In 2019, World Athletics opted to set a maximum testosterone level for the 400, 800, and one-mile women&#x27;s races in the 2020 Summer Olympics. Caster Semenya, an intersex woman who won gold in the women&#x27;s 800 m in both the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, filed to appeal the decision, which would effectively ban her from competing in middle-distance races due to hyperandrogenism. She subsequently attempted to compete in the women&#x27;s 5k, but failed to qualify by the June deadline.
* In 2020, Human Rights Watch reported that Ugandan runner, Annet Negesa, was misinformed about hormone testing by the IAAF. The IAAF referred her to a French medical clinic, which specialized in intersex conditions. There she underwent more testing and surgery to remove her internal testes. However, before the surgery, Negesa was told it would be &quot;like an injection&quot; and was not informed of the extent of the procedure.

==Transgender athletes==
In November 2015, the IOC held a meeting to address both its transgender and hyperandrogenism policies. In regard to transgender athletes it stated that transgender athletes cannot be excluded from an opportunity to participate in sporting competition. Transgender athletes who identified themselves as female would be allowed to compete in that category as long as their testosterone levels were below 10 nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to the competition. There would be no restrictions on transgender athletes who identify and compete as male since their condition is disadvantageous. In 2018, the IAAF lowered the maximum level to 5 nmol/L.

Transgender athletes who wish to compete in the female category are allowed to do so if their testosterone levels are in accordance with the required levels. However, the IOC stated that requiring surgical anatomical changes as a requirement for participation may be considered a violation of human rights. Athletics may for some transgender people engage them within greater society in affirming ways. However, others opposed to the participation of transgender athletes on women&#x27;s teams state that the argument is unsound. Athletes who have faced opposition include Mianne Bagger, Martine Delaney (who participated in &quot;Soccer Tasmanian&#x27;s women&#x27;s league&quot;) and Lana Lawless.

* Professional tennis player Renée Richards, a transgender woman, was barred from playing as a woman at the 1976 US Open unless she submitted to chromosome testing. She sued the United States Tennis Association and in 1977 won the right to play as a woman without submitting to testing.
*American Collegiate athlete Lia Thomas, is a transgender woman. In 2022, Thomas achieved top honours in swimming the women&#x27;s 500-yard freestyle, as she was crowned first place in her final NCAA competition.

<text>Wednesfield () is a town and historic village in the City of Wolverhampton, in the county of the West Midlands, England, It is east-northeast of Wolverhampton city centre and about from Birmingham and is part of the West Midlands conurbation. It was historically within the county of Staffordshire.

Its name comes from the Old English &quot;Wōdnesfeld&quot; meaning &quot;Woden&#x27;s Field&quot;, open land belonging to, or holy to, the high god of the Germanic Pantheon.

Local areas include Ashmore Park and Wood End. There is also a formal garden at Wednesfield Park.

==Geography==
Wednesfield lies at (52.5998°, −2.0827°), and is located to the northeast of Wolverhampton city centre on the northern fringe of the West Midlands conurbation. It was historically part of the county of Staffordshire, and since 1974 has been part of the West Midlands metropolitan county.

The south of the town lies over coal measures whilst the town centre has dolerite deposits and the area to the north lies over mudstone and sandstone. The town lies on generally flat land between 130m and 140m above sea level, rising to around 170m in the north.

There are no navigable rivers within the town, although the original course of the River Tame crossed the south-east of the town.

==Governance==
Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Wednesfield formed part of the Wolverhampton Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. This replaced an earlier arrangement where the Parish had operated a workhouse on Old Heath Road since 1723. In 1863 the Wednesfield Local Board of Health was established. With reference to the Local Government Act 1858, it was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township, and replaced an earlier Sanitary Committee that was established in 1856. The Local Board was only in existence for three years before being split into two, one for Wednesfield itself, and one for Wednesfield Heath.

Wednesfield was formerly a township in the parish of Wolverhampton, in 1866 Wednesfield became a separate civil parish.

Following the Local Government Act 1894, the rump of the parish (minus Wednesfield Heath and part of what became Short Heath Urban District) became an urban district within the administrative county of Staffordshire.

With the exception of a loss of 24 acres (with a census population of 224) to the County Borough of Wolverhampton in 1933, the Urban District remained intact until 1 April 1966, when due to the provisions of the Local Government Act 1958, most of the Wednesfield Urban District was merged into Wolverhampton County Borough, though some parts were incorporated into Walsall County Borough and others into Cannock Rural District, now part of South Staffordshire district. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Wolverhampton, Essington and Walsall. In 1961 the parish had a population of 33,048.

In the early 1950s, when Wednesfield was still independent from its larger neighbour, Wolverhampton council developed two overspill estates – Ashmore Park and Long Knowle – in Wednesfield to rehouse families from slums in the town.

For electoral purposes, Wednesfield is represented by the wards of Wednesfield North, Wednesfield South and Fallings Park, which together make up the Wednesfield and Fallings Park LANA (Local Area and Neighbourhood Arrangements).

It is part of the Wolverhampton North East constituency and is represented in the House of Commons by Sureena Brackenridge (a member of the Labour Party) following the 2024 general election.

==History==
On 5 August 910 the allied forces of Mercia and Wessex defeated an army of Northumbrian Vikings in the Battle of Tettenhall (sometimes called the Battle of Wednesfield or Wōdnesfeld).

Wednesfield was formerly well known for making all kinds of traps, from mousetraps, to mantraps and locks. Many of the factories that dominated the area have been cleared to make way for houses and other buildings.

==Religion==
The Church of St Thomas is located in the town centre. It was originally consecrated in August 1750, as a chapel of ease of St. Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton and known as the Chapel of St. Thomas in Wednesfield. It became a separate parish in 1849. It was almost completely destroyed by fire on 18 January 1902, as a result of which the tower is the only remaining part of the original building. The church was reconstructed in similar style to the original and continues in active use as a place of worship.

The Guru Nanak Gurdwara was opened in 1979 and is also located in the town centre, and caters for the local Sikh community, many of whom are descendants of those who immigrated to the area in the 1950s and onwards. A part of the Gurdwara suffered fire damage in 2002 so the committee decided to demolish the original building and the rebuild was ready by 2004. It has lifts for the elderly.

==Economy==

Wednesfield Village or &#x27;the village&#x27; as it is still referred to by many residents provides a range of shopping, office and community facilities for residents in the north east of Wolverhampton and some adjoining parts of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, along with services for the major industrial areas to the south of the town and New Cross Hospital. Just to the west of the town centre, there is a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket and the Bentley Bridge Retail Park. There is also a retail market.

Bentley Bridge consistes of both leisure and retail components. The leisure component is in the form of a multiplex cinema and bowling alley together with fast food outlets, a pub, numerous restaurants, whilst there is 14,700 m2 of retail space which includes a fitness gym.

The proximity to Wolverhampton city centre has been a major constraint on retail economic growth within the town. Wednesfield is part of a network of lower order Black Country town centres, providing principally convenience shopping facilities for a local catchment area and it is surrounded by centres with a similar role including Bilston to the south, Willenhall to the south east and Bloxwich to the east.

However, since 2009 the Bentley Bridge Retail Park has thrived with empty units being filled by national retailers. In September 2011 retailer TK Maxx announced plans to close its city centre store in Wolverhampton and relocate to Bentley Bridge. Whilst the retail park thrives, local independent traders on the high street continue to suffer due to economic circumstances.

The area to the south of the former railway line is characterised by industrial development, mostly with small units although there is some larger development such a steel processing and distribution plant. Historically, the main industries were coal mining and trap making, although mining ceased in the area in the early twentieth century.

==Transport==
The Wyrley and Essington Canal running through the town was opened in 1797. It was constructed to allow coal traffic to travel between mines near Great Wyrley and Wolverhampton, and was constructed following the contours of the land. This meant that the centre of the town was surrounded on three sides by the canal, and that almost all of the pre-existing roads required hump-backed bridges, and despite the improvement in communications and the potential for transporting goods via the canal, it is recorded that some local residents felt that it actually obstructed the development of the town, rather than assisting it. A second canal through the town, the Bentley Canal, opened in 1843 between Wednesfield Junction, near the modern New Cross Hospital, and Walsall. The canal was abandoned in the 1960s, and only a short section at Wednesfield Junction is extant.
Wednesfield railway station on the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway was opened in 1872, connecting the town with Wolverhampton High Level and Walsall. It was operated by the Midland Railway, and was located on Neachells Lane to the south of the town centre. It closed to passenger traffic in 1931, although it remained open for goods traffic until the 1980s. Much of the trackbed was reused for the A4124 Wednesfield Way, which bypasses the town centre and opened in 1999.

The first railway within the township was the Grand Junction Railway, where Wednesfield Heath railway station (opened in 1837) was the primary station for Wolverhampton, and was located on Station Road, Heath Town. The station was replaced by Wolverhampton High Level in the city centre, and closed to passengers in 1873 whilst remaining open for goods traffic until 1965. The siting of this station at Heath Town has been cited as a reason for the separation of Wednesfield and Heath Town.

Public transport in Wednesfield is coordinated by Transport for West Midlands. Most bus services within the town are operated by National Express West Midlands, with services from the town centre to destinations including Wolverhampton city centre, Bilston, Bloxwich, Walsall and Willenhall. 

The 59 bus route which runs from Wolverhampton city centre to Ashmore Park via New Cross Hospital and Wednesfield High Street is the most frequent in the city.

National Express West Midlands service 9 (previously 60) operates between Walsall, Pelsall, Bloxwich and Wolverhampton half hourly.

The 71 bus route by Chaserider (previously Arriva) provides an hourly link to Essington, Great Wyrley and Cannock. Diamond Bus tendered service 65 provides an hourly service between Wolverhampton and Fordhouses via New Cross Hospital and Bushbury Crematorium.

An extension of the West Midlands Metro through Wednesfield is planned, on the &quot;5Ws&quot; route from Wolverhampton to Wednesbury via Willenhall and Walsall.

<text>The prime minister of India is the chief executive of the Government of India and chair of the Union Council of Ministers. Although the president of India is the constitutional, nominal, and ceremonial head of state, in practice and ordinarily, the executive authority is vested in the prime minister and their chosen Council of Ministers. The prime minister is the leader elected by the party with a majority in the lower house of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, which is the main legislative body in the Republic of India. The prime minister and their cabinet are at all times responsible to the Lok Sabha. The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. The prime minister ranks third in the order of precedence.
The prime minister is appointed by the president of India; however, the prime minister has to enjoy the confidence of the majority of Lok Sabha members, who are directly elected every five years, unless a prime minister resigns. The prime minister is the presiding member of the Council of Ministers of the Union government. The prime minister unilaterally controls the selection and dismissal of members of the council; and allocation of posts to members within the government. This council, which is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha as per , assists the president regarding the operations under the latter&#x27;s powers; however, by the virtue of of the Constitution, such &#x27;aid and advice&#x27; tendered by the council is .

Since 1947, India has had 16 prime ministers. Jawaharlal Nehru was India&#x27;s first prime minister, serving as prime minister of the Dominion of India from 15 August 1947 until 26 January 1950, and thereafter of the Republic of India until his death in May 1964. (India conducted its first post-independence general elections in 1952). Earlier, Nehru had served as prime minister of the Interim Government of India during the British Raj from 2 September 1946 until 14 August 1947, his party, the Indian National Congress having won the 1946 Indian provincial elections. Nehru was succeeded by Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose 1 year 7-month term ended in his death in Tashkent, then in the USSR, where he had signed the Tashkent Declaration between India and Pakistan. Indira Gandhi, Nehru&#x27;s daughter, succeeded Shastri in 1966 to become the country&#x27;s first female prime minister. Eleven years later, her party, the Indian National Congress, lost the 1977 Indian general election to the Janata Party, whose leader Morarji Desai became the first non-Congress prime minister. After Desai resigned in 1979, his former associate Charan Singh briefly held office until the Congress won the 1980 Indian general election and Indira Gandhi returned as prime minister. Her second term as prime minister ended five years later on 31 October 1984, when she was assassinated by her bodyguards. Her son Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as India&#x27;s youngest premier. Members of NehruGandhi family have been prime minister for approximately 38 years.

After a general election loss, Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s five-year term ended; his former cabinet colleague, Vishwanath Pratap Singh of the Janata Dal, formed the year-long National Front coalition government in 1989. A seven-month interlude under prime minister Chandra Shekhar followed, after which the Congress party returned to power, forming the government under P. V. Narasimha Rao in June 1991, Rajiv Gandhi having been assassinated earlier that year. Rao&#x27;s five-year term was succeeded by four short-lived governments—Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for 13 days in 1996, a year each under United Front prime ministers H. D. Deve Gowda and Inder Kumar Gujral, and Vajpayee again for 13 months in 1998–1999. In 1999, Vajpayee&#x27;s National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won the general election, the first non-Congress alliance to do so, and he served a full five-year term as prime minister. The Congress and its United Progressive Alliance won the general elections in 2004 and 2009, Manmohan Singh serving as prime minister between 2004 and 2014. The BJP won the 2014 Indian general election, and its parliamentary leader Narendra Modi formed the first non-Congress single-party majority government. The BJP went on to win the 2019 Indian general election with a bigger margin, granting a second term for the incumbent Modi government. After the 2024 Indian general election, Modi became the prime minister for the third consecutive time, leading a coalition government after the BJP lost its majority, only the second to do so after the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

<doc id="844746" wikidata="Q15707108" url="?curid=844746" title="Journal of Mundane Behavior">
<text>The Journal of Mundane Behavior was a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal of sociology covering everyday behavior and experiences. It was published online with three issues a year. The journal&#x27;s first issue came out in February 2000 and the last issue appeared in 2004.

The journal was dedicated to exploring &quot;the minor, redundant and commonplace scenes of life&quot; and celebrating &quot;the majesty of the obvious&quot;. The first issue included articles about the behavior of Japanese people on elevators, the arrangement of books on library shelves, and the social implications of facial hair. The journal reflected a recent trend among sociologists to &quot;investigate the largely unconscious verbal and nonverbal conventions of everyday social interactions,&quot; in contrast to the field&#x27;s historical focus on deviant behavior.

The editor-in-chief was Scott Schaffer (Millersville University of Pennsylvania). The original concept for the journal came from Schaffer and founding co-editor Myron Orleans (California State University, Fullerton). They were &quot;inspired in part by an article in the scholarly journal &quot;Sociological Theory&quot; that called for closer inspection of those parts of life that we routinely ignore.&quot; The two universities co-hosted the site.

<text>Dorrian&#x27;s Red Hand, also known simply as Dorrian&#x27;s, is a famed Irish-American bar located at 1616 Second Avenue at East 84th Street, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York City, New York.

Started by Irish immigrant James &quot;Red Dog&quot; Dorrian in 1960 and operated by his son Jack, the popular hangout became a social pillar for preppy Upper East Side teenagers, college students, and young urban professionals. It is known for its &quot;old time&quot; atmosphere and the chummy and clubby demeanor of its patrons.
Today, the bar is still family-owned and managed by Jack Dorrian&#x27;s son, Jimmy. Dorrian&#x27;s has expanded to a second location in Jersey City, New Jersey. Dorrian&#x27;s Red Hand is a common hang out for the players of the New York Yankees.

Dorrian&#x27;s has served as a filming location for &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot;, &quot;The Deli&quot;, and episodes of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;Gallery Girls&quot;, and &quot;Fleishman Is In Trouble&quot;.

<text>Richard Darwin Keynes, CBE, FRS ( ; 14 August 1919 – 12 June 2010) was a British physiologist. The great-grandson of Charles Darwin, Keynes edited his great-grandfather&#x27;s accounts and illustrations of Darwin&#x27;s famous voyage aboard into &quot;The Beagle Record: Selections From the Original Pictorial Records and Written Accounts of the Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle&quot;, which won praise from the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;.

==Career==

Keynes was the eldest son of Geoffrey Keynes and his wife Margaret Elizabeth (née Darwin), daughter of George Darwin. He was educated at Oundle School before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1945, he married Anne Pinsent Adrian, daughter of Edgar Adrian and his wife Hester (née Pinsent). They had four sons, Adrian (1946–1974), Randal Keynes (1948-2023), Roger Keynes (b. 1951), and Simon Keynes (born 1952).

During the war, Keynes served as a temporary experimental officer at the Anti-Submarine Establishment and Admiralty Signals Establishment (1940–45), returning to Cambridge after the war to complete his degree (1st Class, Natural Science Tripos Part II, 1946). Keynes remained at Trinity College as a Research Fellow between 1948 and 1952, winning the Gedge Prize in 1948 and the Rolleston Memorial Prize in 1950. His career at Cambridge included: demonstrator in Physiology (1949–53); Lecturer (1953–60); Fellow of Peterhouse (1952–60, and an Honorary Fellow, 1989); Head of the Physiology Department, and first Deputy Director (1960–64), then Director (1965–73); Director of the ARC Institute of Animal Physiology (1965–72); Professor of Physiology (1973–87); Fellow of Churchill College, since 1961.

Outside Cambridge, Keynes&#x27;s positions included: Secretary-General of the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (1972–78), then Vice-President (1978–81) and President (1981–84); chairman of the International Cell Research Organisation (1981–83) and the ICSU/Unesco International Biosciences Networks (1982–93); President of the European Federation of Physiological Societies (1991); a Vice-President of the Royal Society (1965–68); Croonian Lecturer (1983); Fellow of Eton College (1963–78); foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy (1971), American Philosophical Society (1977), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1978) and the American Physiological Society (1994).

<text>Anthony Salvin (17 October 1799 – 17 December 1881) was an English architect. He gained a reputation as an expert on medieval buildings and applied this expertise to his new buildings and his restorations. He restored castles and country houses, and built a number of new houses and churches.

==Early life and training==
Anthony Salvin was born in Sunderland Bridge, County Durham, as the only child of Anthony Salvin, a soldier, and his second wife Elizabeth (Eliza) Mills. He was educated at Durham School and in 1820 became a pupil of John Paterson of Edinburgh while he was working on the restoration of Brancepeth Castle in County Durham.

In 1821 Salvin moved to Finchley in north London. He had an introduction to Sir John Soane but did not enter his office. According to his nephew, he entered the office of John Nash. In 1824 he was elected as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Soon after this he went on a sketching tour of Great Britain. On 26 July 1826 he married his cousin, Anne Andrews Nesfield. With her he had six children, two of whom died in infancy.

==Early career==
Salvin&#x27;s first major commission was Mamhead House in Devon for Robert William Newman. This was designed in the Tudor style to a symmetrical plan. It was adapted from a plan by Charles Fowler and this placed restrictions on his design. His next design was for Moreby Hall in the East Riding of Yorkshire for Henry Preston where he was free to develop a complete design in the Tudor style, again on a symmetrical plan.

At Scotney Castle in Kent he designed for Edward Hussey an asymmetrical design in the Tudor style. In 1831 Salvin embarked on what is considered to be his most important early domestic work at Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire for Gregory Gregory. Salvin&#x27;s design combined elements from Montacute House in Somerset and Hengrave Hall in Suffolk. However, before the building was complete, Salvin was replaced as architect by William Burn. In 1835 Salvin spent five weeks in Germany.

In 1836 Salvin entered a design in Tudor style in the competition for the new Palace of Westminster which had possibly been inspired by his visit to Germany. However this was unsuccessful, as was his entry for the competition to design the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He won the competition for the design of the Carlton Club in Pall Mall, London, but the club decided not to proceed with his plan. After losing a further competition, this time to design the Army and Navy Club, Salvin did not enter any more competitions.

==Mature career==

Most of Salvin&#x27;s designs for major houses continued to be in the Tudor style. These include Keele Hall in Staffordshire for Ralph Sneyd (1793–1870), and Thoresby Hall in Nottinghamshire for Sydney Pierrepont, 3rd Earl Manvers. There were exceptions, including Penoyre House in Brecon, an Italianate villa-style house for Colonel John Lloyd Vaughan Watkins and Oxon Hoath in West Peckham, Kent in the French Châteauesque style for Sir William Geary, 3rd Baronet.

A major part of Salvin&#x27;s work was to restore, refit and create castles. In 1835 he refaced Norwich Castle, in 1844 he repaired the ruins of Newark Castle and in 1845 he repaired the ruins of Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight. In the early 1840s the Queen&#x27;s Gate of Caernarvon Castle collapsed, and in 1844 Salvin repaired it and rebuilt some of the other masonry of the castle. He also restored Naworth Castle in Cumbria after it was damaged by a fire on 18May 1844.

In 1851 he surveyed the Beauchamp Tower of the Tower of London and subsequently restored the Salt, Wakefield and White Towers and the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Following this he was instructed by Prince Albert to carry out work on Windsor Castle. This included replacing sash windows with lancets and mullioned windows and rebuilding the Clewer Tower. Salvin designed Peckforton Castle in Cheshire for John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache as a recreation of a castle of the time of Edward I. In 1852 he started work on the restoration of Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. This included replacing one of the towers with a larger tower, the Prudhoe Tower, creating a porte-cochère, replacing windows and replanning the interior.

Salvin also restored and repaired 20 old churches and three cathedrals, and built 34 new churches. In the early 1840s he had worked on The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, employing James Rattee, and following this he was made an honorary member of the Cambridge Camden Society. He arranged for the removal of buildings around the south transept of Norwich Cathedral and reordered its choir. He also made alterations to Durham and Wells Cathedrals. In all he designed at least 34 new churches. Salvin&#x27;s restorations were not to the liking of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, particularly his removal of &quot;unwanted fabric&quot; from churches. Other work carried out by Salvin included rebuilding the keep of Durham Castle for student accommodation, and work on restoring Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Later life==

In 1857, while working on Warwick Castle, Salvin suffered a stroke but recovered from it. In 1860, his wife died and he designed a new house for himself, Hawksfold at Fernhurst, Sussex. In 1863 he was awarded the royal gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and in 1879 he retired from formal practice. He died at Hawksfold in 1881 and was buried at Fernhurst. His estate was valued at over £78,000 (£ in 2022).

<doc id="844772" wikidata="Q944806" url="?curid=844772" title="Operational risk">
<text>Operational risk is the risk of losses caused by flawed or failed processes, policies, systems or events that disrupt business operations. Employee errors, criminal activity such as fraud, and physical events are among the factors that can trigger operational risk. The process to manage operational risk is known as operational risk management. The definition of operational risk, adopted by the European Solvency II Directive for insurers, is a variation adopted from the Basel II regulations for banks: &quot;The risk of a change in value caused by the fact that actual losses, incurred for inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events (including legal risk), differ from the expected losses&quot;. 
The scope of operational risk is then broad,
and can also include other classes of risks, such as fraud, security, privacy protection, legal risks, physical (e.g. infrastructure shutdown) or environmental risks.
Operational risks similarly may impact broadly, in that they can affect client satisfaction, reputation and shareholder value, all while increasing business volatility.

Previously, in Basel I, operational risk was negatively defined: namely that operational risk are all risks which are &quot;not&quot; market risk and not credit risk. Some banks have therefore also used the term operational risk synonymously with non-financial risks.
In October 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed a revision to its operational risk capital framework that sets out a new standardized approach to replace the basic indicator approach and the standardized approach for calculating operational risk capital.

Contrary to other risks (e.g. credit risk, market risk, insurance risk) operational risks are usually not willingly incurred nor are they revenue driven. Moreover, they are not diversifiable and cannot be laid off. This means that as long as people, systems, and processes remain imperfect, operational risk cannot be fully eliminated.
Operational risk is, nonetheless, manageable as to keep losses within some level of risk tolerance (i.e. the amount of risk one is prepared to accept in pursuit of his objectives), determined by balancing the costs of improvement against the expected benefits.
Wider trends such as globalization, the expansion of the internet and the rise of social media, as well as the increasing demands for greater corporate accountability worldwide, reinforce the need for proper risk management.

Thus operational risk management (ORM) is a specialized discipline within risk management. 
It constitutes the continuous-process of risk assessment, decision making, and implementation of risk controls, resulting in the acceptance, mitigation, or avoidance of the various operational risks. 
ORM somewhat overlaps quality management and the internal audit function.

==Background==
Until Basel II reforms to banking supervision, operational risk was a residual category reserved for risks and uncertainties which were difficult to quantify and manage in traditional ways – the &quot;other risks&quot; basket.

Such regulations institutionalized operational risk as a category of regulatory and managerial attention and connected operational risk management with good corporate governance.

Businesses in general, and other institutions such as the military, have been aware, for many years, of hazards arising from operational factors, internal or external. The primary goal of the military is to fight and win wars in quick and decisive fashion, and with minimal losses. For the military and the businesses of the world alike, operational risk management is an effective process for preserving resources by anticipation.

Two decades (from 1980 to the early 2000s) of globalization and deregulation (&quot;e.g.&quot; Big Bang (financial markets)), combined with the increased sophistication of financial services around the world, introduced additional complexities into the activities of banks, insurers, and firms in general and therefore their risk profiles.

Since the mid-1990s, the topics of market risk and credit risk have been the subject of much debate and research, with the result that financial institutions have made significant progress in the identification, measurement, and management of both these forms of risk.

However, the near collapse of the U.S. financial system in September 2008 is an indication that our ability to measure market and credit risk is far from perfect and eventually led to the introduction of new regulatory requirements worldwide, including Basel III regulations for banks and Solvency II regulations for insurers.

Events such as the September 11 terrorist attacks, rogue trading losses at Société Générale, Barings, AIB, UBS, and National Australia Bank serve to highlight the fact that the scope of risk management extends beyond merely market and credit risk.

These reasons underscore banks&#x27; and supervisors&#x27; growing focus upon the identification and measurement of operational risk.

The list of risks (and, more importantly, the scale of these risks) faced by banks today includes fraud, system failures, terrorism, and employee compensation claims. These types of risk are generally classified under the term &#x27;operational risk&#x27;.

The identification and measurement of operational risk is a real and live issue for modern-day banks, particularly since the decision by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to introduce a capital charge for this risk as part of the new capital adequacy framework (Basel II).

==Definition==
The Basel Committee defines operational risk in Basel II and Basel III as:

The Basel Committee recognizes that operational risk is a term that has a variety of meanings and therefore, for internal purposes, banks are permitted to adopt their own definitions of operational risk, provided that the minimum elements in the Committee&#x27;s definition are included.

==Scope exclusions==
The Basel II definition of operational risk excludes, for example, strategic risk – the risk of a loss arising from a poor strategic business decision.

Other risk terms are seen as potential consequences of operational risk events. For example, reputational risk (damage to an organization through loss of its reputation or standing) can arise as a consequence (or impact) of operational failures – as well as from other events.

==Event types==
The following lists the seven official Basel II event types with some examples for each category:

# Internal Fraud – misappropriation of assets, tax evasion, intentional mismarking of positions, bribery
# External Fraud – theft of information, hacking damage, third-party theft and forgery
# Employment Practices and Workplace Safety – discrimination, workers compensation, employee health and safety
# Clients, Products, and Business Practice – market manipulation, antitrust, improper trade, product defects, fiduciary breaches, account churning
# Damage to Physical Assets – natural disasters, terrorism, vandalism
# Business Disruption and Systems Failures – utility disruptions, software failures, hardware failures
# Execution, Delivery, and Process Management – data entry errors, accounting errors, failed mandatory reporting, negligent loss of client assets

===Vendor risk===
Vendor risk refers to the risk caused by the dependency of one&#x27;s services or products on a lower-level service or product sourced from a particular vendor. It includes the risks of 
* the vendor no longer providing the required product or service, 
* substantially increasing the cost of such or
* making modifications to the provided product or service such that new versions of the product no longer meet one&#x27;s functional or non-functional requirements.

==Difficulties==
It is relatively straightforward for an organization to set and observe specific, measurable levels of market risk and credit risk because models exist which attempt to predict the potential impact of market movements, or changes in the cost of credit. These models are only as good as the underlying assumptions, and a large part of the recent financial crisis arose because the valuations generated by these models for particular types of investments were based on incorrect assumptions.

By contrast, it is relatively difficult to identify or assess levels of operational risk and its many sources. Historically organizations have accepted operational risk as an unavoidable cost of doing business. Many now though collect data on operational losses – for example through system failure or fraud – and are using this data to model operational risk and to calculate a capital reserve against future operational losses. In addition to the Basel II requirement for banks, this is now a requirement for European insurance firms who are in the process of implementing Solvency II, the equivalent of Basel II for the insurance sector.

==Methods for calculating operational risk capital==
Basel II and various supervisory bodies of the countries have prescribed various soundness standards for operational risk management for banks and similar financial institutions. To complement these standards, Basel II has given guidance to 3 broad methods of capital calculation for operational risk:

* Basic Indicator Approach – based on annual revenue of the Financial Institution
* Standardized Approach – based on annual revenue of each of the broad business lines of the Financial Institution
* Advanced Measurement Approaches – based on the internally developed risk measurement framework of the bank adhering to the standards prescribed (methods include IMA, LDA, Scenario-based, Scorecard etc.)

The operational risk management framework should include identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting, control and mitigation frameworks for operational risk.

There are a number of methodologies to choose from when modeling operational risk, each with its advantages and target applications. The ultimate choice of the methodology/methodologies to use in your institution depends on a number of factors, including:

* Time sensitivity for analysis;
* Resources desired and/or available for the task;
* Approaches used for other risk measures;
* Expected use of results (e.g., allocating capital to business units, prioritizing control improvement projects, satisfying regulators that your institution is measuring risk, providing an incentive for better management of operational risk, etc.);
* Senior management understanding and commitment; and
* Existing complementary processes, such as self-assessment

=== Standardised Measurement Approach (Basel III) ===
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has proposed the &quot;Standardised Measurement Approach&quot; (SMA) as a method of assessing operational risk as a replacement for all existing approaches, including AMA. The objective is to provide stable, comparable and risk-sensitive estimates for the operational risk exposure and is effective January 1, 2022.
The SMA puts weight on the internal loss history (losses of the last 10 years must be considered). It is possible to consider net losses (after recoveries and insurance).

The marginal coefficient (α) increases with the size of the BI as shown in the table below.

The ILM is defined as:

formula_1

where the Loss Component (LC) is equal to 15 times average annual operational risk losses incurred over the previous 10 years.

<text>Interstate 495 (I-495) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in southeastern New York state. It is jointly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), MTA Bridges and Tunnels (TBTA), and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). East of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, I-495 is known as the Long Island Expressway (LIE).

Spanning approximately , I-495 traverses Long Island from the western portal of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel in the New York City borough of Manhattan to County Route 58 (CR 58) in Riverhead in the east. I-495 intersects with I-295 in Bayside, Queens, through which it connects with I-95. The 2017 route log erroneously shows the section of highway between I-278 in Long Island City and I-678 in Corona as New York State Route 495 (NY 495).

The LIE designation, despite being commonly applied to all of I-495 east of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, technically refers to the stretch of highway in Nassau and Suffolk counties. The section from the Queens Midtown Tunnel to Queens Boulevard is known as the Queens Midtown Expressway, and the section between Queens Boulevard and the Queens–Nassau county line is known as the Horace Harding Expressway. The service roads which run parallel to either side of the expressway in Queens are signed as Borden Avenue and Queens Midtown Expressway and as Horace Harding Expressway and Horace Harding Boulevard; from the Queens–Nassau county line to Sills Road, they are designated as the unsigned New York State Route 906A (NY 906A) and New York State Route 906B (NY 906B).

==Route description==
===New York City===

The highway begins at the western end of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan. The route heads eastward, passing under FDR Drive and the East River as it proceeds through the TBTA-maintained tunnel to Queens. Once on Long Island, the highway passes through the site of the tunnel&#x27;s former toll plaza and becomes the Queens–Midtown Expressway as it travels through the western portion of the borough. after entering Queens, I-495 meets I-278 (Brooklyn–Queens Expressway) at exit 17, then briefly becomes a two-level, 12-lane highway traveling across Calvary Cemetery. Merging into one level at Maurice Avenue, I-495 continues through the neighborhoods of Maspeth, Elmhurst, and Rego Park. East of NY 25 (Queens Boulevard) in Rego Park, I-495 becomes the Horace Harding Expressway. I-495 heads northeast through Corona to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, intersecting both the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway (I-678) within the park limits. Because the interchanges in this area are close together, the highway employs two sets of collector–distributor roads through this area: one between 69th and 99th streets and one between the Grand Central Parkway and I-678.

The expressway continues east as a six-lane highway, veering to the southeast to bypass Kissena Park before curving back to the northeast to meet the Clearview Expressway (I-295) at the northern edge of Cunningham Park. Past I-295, I-495 passes by the &quot;Queens Giant&quot;, the oldest and tallest tree in the New York metropolitan area. The tree, located just north of I-495 in Alley Pond Park, is visible from the highway&#x27;s westbound lanes. To the east, the freeway connects to the Cross Island Parkway at exit 31 in the park prior to exiting the New York City limits, crossing into Nassau County and becoming the LIE.

Although the LIE name officially begins outside the New York City border, almost all locals and most signage use &quot;the Long Island Expressway&quot; or &quot;the LIE&quot; to refer the entire length of I-495. The service roads of I-495 are called Borden Avenue and Queens Midtown Expressway between I-278 and Queens Boulevard, and they are known as Horace Harding Expressway between Queens Boulevard and the Nassau County line. The Horace Harding Expressway section follows the path of Horace Harding Boulevard (also previously called Nassau Boulevard), which was named for J. Horace Harding (1863–1929), a finance magnate who directed the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System. Harding used his influence to promote the development of Long Island&#x27;s roadways, lending strong support to Robert Moses&#x27;s &quot;great parkway plan&quot;. Harding also urged construction of a highway from Queens Boulevard to the Nassau County Line, in order to provide better access to Oakland Country Club, where he was a member. After his death, the boulevard he helped build was named for him. Horace Harding was not related to the former President Warren G. Harding.

===Nassau and Suffolk counties===

Heading into Nassau County, the expressway contains a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction, which begins at exit 33 and runs to central Suffolk County. I-495 and the adjacent Northern State Parkway, which parallels the LIE through the county, meet three times, although they actually cross only once at exit 46 near the county line. I-495 interchanges with the Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway (NY 135). In Suffolk County, the LIE continues its eight-lane configuration with the HOV lane to exit 64 (NY 112). At this point, the HOV lane ends and the highway narrows to six lanes; additionally, the concrete Jersey barrier gives way to a wide, grassy median, the asphalt road surface is replaced by a concrete surface, and the expressway is no longer illuminated by streetlights, reflecting the road&#x27;s location in a more rural area of Long Island.

From NY 112 east, the expressway runs through more rural, woodland areas on its trek towards Riverhead. At exit 66 (County Route 101), the service roads become fragmented, and they fully terminate at exit 68 (William Floyd Parkway). Exit 70 (CR 111) in Manorville is the last full interchange, as it is the last interchange that allows eastbound traffic on, and the first to allow westbound off. After exit 71 (NY 24/Nugent Drive), the expressway begins to narrow as it approaches its eastern terminus. Until 2008, just before exit 72 (NY 25), the three eastbound lanes narrowed to two, which, in turn, narrowed almost immediately to a single lane at exit 73, which lies east of exit 72. , of the two lanes, one lane is designated for exit 72 and the other is for exit 73, which ends the squeeze into a single lane that formerly existed at exit 73. At exit 73, all traffic along the expressway is diverted onto a ramp leading to eastbound CR 58, marking the east end of the route.

====HOV restrictions====
There is one HOV lane in each direction, in the median of the highway, between exit 32 (Little Neck Parkway), near the Queens–Nassau border, to exit 64 (NY 112), in central Suffolk County. From 6:00 am to 10:00 am and from 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm Monday through Friday, the HOV lanes are limited to busses, motorcycles, and Clean Pass vehicles without occupancy requirement and passenger vehicles with at least two occupants. Trailers and commercial trucks are always prohibited therein. Vehicles are only allowed to enter and exit the lanes at designated junctions.

Originally, the HOV lanes were restricted to passenger vehicles with at least two occupants. Starting in 2006, drivers of certain hybrid vehicle models were allowed to use the lanes even if they were driving alone. By 2014, over one-third of all traffic on the LIE between exits 32 and 64 used the HOV lane during peak hours. NYSDOT contemplated restricting the lanes to passenger vehicles with at least three occupants but ultimately decided against this change.

==History==
I-495 was constructed in stages from 1940 to 1972. Its completion was intended to alleviate congestion along local roads on Long Island. Most of the highway in Queens was built as part of the Interstate Highway System, with 90 percent funding from the federal government and 10 percent from the New York state government. The portion of the highway in Nassau and Suffolk counties was built with equal funding from the federal and state governments.

===Construction of Queens segment===
==== Queens–Midtown Expressway ====

The first piece of what is now I-495 – the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, linking Manhattan and Queens – opened to traffic on November 15, 1940. The highway connecting the tunnel to Laurel Hill Boulevard was built around the same time and named the &quot;Midtown Highway&quot;. The tunnel, the Midtown Highway, and the segment of Laurel Hill Boulevard between the highway and Queens Boulevard all became part of a realigned NY 24 in the mid-1940s. Parts of this highway were built on the right-of-way of a streetcar line that extended from Hunters Point to southern Flushing. In the 1940s, city planner Robert Moses proposed the construction of a system of highways that would traverse the New York City area. The plan was to cost $800 million (equivalent to $ in ), and, in February 1945, the city agreed to pay $60 million (equivalent to $ in ) of that cost. That November, the city, state, and federal governments agreed to fund several new highways in New York City. Among these was the Queens Midtown Expressway, which was to cost $10.62 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Plans did not proceed further until March 1951, when Moses proposed constructing the six-lane Queens–Midtown Expressway between Laurel Hill and Queens boulevards. This was part of a larger, $30-million (equivalent to $ in ) plan that also included the Horace Harding Expressway. By October 1952, the cost of the two projects had increased to $55 million (equivalent to $ in ), of which the Queens–Midtown Expressway was to cost $21 million (equivalent to $ in ). To help fund the Queens–Midtown Expressway, Moses reallocated funding from two other highway projects in early 1953. That October, the New York City Planning Commission approved a minor revision to the Queens–Midtown Expressway&#x27;s route in Maspeth and South Elmhurst, thus reducing land acquisition costs by $769,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

The city government awarded the first construction contracts for the highway in July 1953. The first section of the highway to open was the section between Laurel Hill Boulevard and Maurice Avenue, which opened on February 24, 1955. The six-lane highway ran through Calvary Cemetery. Afterward, the old Midtown Highway became known as the &quot;Queens–Midtown Expressway&quot;. The entire highway from Laurel Hill Boulevard (by this point upgraded into the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway) to the junction of Queens Boulevard (NY 24 and NY 25) and Horace Harding Boulevard (NY 25D) opened on November 5, 1955. This section of the LIE had cost $29.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was funded by the TBTA, of which Moses was chair. NY 24 initially remained routed on Laurel Hill and Queens boulevards.

==== Horace Harding Expressway ====

The LIE was built over much of Horace Harding Boulevard within eastern Queens and Power House Road within western Nassau County. Prior to the LIE&#x27;s construction, the route was designated as NY 25D. As part of his March 1951 proposal for the Queens–Midtown Expressway, Moses proposed widening an stretch of Horace Harding Boulevard between Queens Boulevard and the Queens–Nassau border from . That May, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the widening of Horace Harding Boulevard and Power House Road and constructing an expressway in the road&#x27;s median at a cost of $25 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project&#x27;s cost had increased to $34 million (equivalent to $ in ) by October 1952. The same year, the New York State Department of Public Works later modified the highway&#x27;s route in the vicinity of Little Neck Parkway, near the Queens–Nassau border, because of complaints from residents. At Little Neck Parkway, Horace Harding Boulevard continued northeast and then eastward, whereas the LIE was to take a more southerly path.

Work began on the Horace Harding Expressway in 1955. However, it soon encountered delays because of weather conditions, construction worker strikes, and difficulties in building across existing roads and swampy land. Business owners along Horace Harding Boulevard complained that the project was reducing their income and isolating their businesses from surrounding neighborhoods. A section of the LIE near Alley Pond Park in eastern Queens, between Cloverdale Boulevard in Bayside and Little Neck Parkway, officially opened on September 25, 1957. The highway segment reduced the need for cars to use West Alley Road, a winding road that crossed the park. Construction on the section between Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst and Parsons Boulevard in Pomonok was several years behind schedule, but this section was open by mid-1959. For several months, the highway abruptly terminated at Parsons Boulevard, and barriers funneled traffic onto the service road; the highway was extended to Peck Avenue in Fresh Meadows in late 1959.

The section of the LIE west of the Clearview Expressway was designated as I-495 in October 1958. The windmill interchange with the Clearview Expressway (I-295) in Bayside was the last section of the LIE in New York City to be completed. Construction on that interchange had started in January 1959. By early 1960, the LIE saw more than 120,000 vehicles per day, although congestion frequently built up at Bayside. The marshy land in the vicinity of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park caused cracking on the expressway&#x27;s pavement. The segment of the LIE near the Clearview Interchange, between Peck Avenue and 224th Street, officially opened on August 12, 1960. The interchange itself, which contained eight ramps and eight overpasses, was not open at the time because I-295 was still under construction. Between 1961 and 1963, in advance of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the NYSDOT built service roads along I-495 in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, and it constructed a partial interchange with I-678.

Originally, I-495&#x27;s westbound and eastbound roadways in Queens were separated by a median measuring wide, with a chainlink fence and emergency telephones. In 1960, state officials announced that they would install a Jersey barrier in the median between 207th Street and the Queens–Nassau border. The remainder of the highway in Queens still contained chainlink fences, which were expensive to repair and could not prevent head-on collisions. In 1970, work commenced on a two-year project to install a Jersey barrier in the median of I-495 from 108th Street to Little Neck Parkway, replacing a median.

=== Extension to Long Island ===
Plans for a highway, the Central Motor Expressway, extending east to Riverhead in Suffolk County, Long Island, were first reported by regional newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot; in late 1953. This length included the Queens–Midtown Expressway, as well as the section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway south of the junction with the Queens–Midtown Expressway. Suffolk County supervisors endorsed the plans soon after they were announced. In 1954, New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey approved plans for the LIE, extending between the Queens–Nassau border and Riverhead. Moses and New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. said that the proposed highway would not charge tolls, regardless of whether the expressway received federal funding under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1952. From the outset, a minimum speed limit of was enforced on the segment of the LIE in Nassau and Suffolk counties.

==== Nassau County ====

On September 30, 1958, the first section of the LIE outside New York City, a segment from the Queens–Nassau county line to Willis Avenue in Roslyn Heights, officially opened to traffic. The section of the LIE between Roslyn and the Nassau–Suffolk border was initially controversial; at a public hearing in late 1957, 100 homeowners criticized the alignment of that section of highway. By early the next year, work had commenced on the section of the LIE between Guinea Woods Road (now Glen Cove Road) and Jericho Turnpike. The New York state government awarded a construction contract for the section of the LIE between Jericho Turnpike and South Oyster Bay Road in June 1959. This was followed in November 1959 by a contract for the section between South Oyster Bay Road and the Suffolk County border.

The LIE was extended to Glen Cove Road in Roslyn on September 29, 1959, with ramps to and from the Northern State Parkway. By this time, the LIE was continuous between Bayside and Roslyn. After the Clearview Interchange opened, the LIE was continuous between Manhattan and Roslyn, and it was designated in its entirety as NY 24. The old surface alignment of NY 24 south of the expressway became NY 24A. The LIE was extended east from Glen Cove Road to NY 106/NY 107 in Jericho on October 8, 1960, and was then opened to South Oyster Bay Road in Syosset in December 1960. By 1962, the NY 24 designation was removed from the LIE and reassigned to its former surface alignment to the south, while the portion of the freeway east of the Clearview Expressway became NY 495 (and later, I-495).

==== Suffolk County ====
By 1958, it was estimated that the entire highway would not be completed until 1970. Real-estate developers believed that the LIE&#x27;s construction was not proceeding quickly enough, and Suffolk County&#x27;s supervisors also advocated for the highway to be completed as soon as possible. Bidding for the first section of the LIE in Suffolk County, from the Nassau border to NY 110 in Melville, began in February 1960. Supporters of the highway believed that its completion would reduce traffic on Long Island&#x27;s west–east arterial roads. Over the next decade, the completion of the LIE in Suffolk County spurred significant population growth in communities along its route.

Over one-third of the LIE within Suffolk County—a section from Melville to Veterans Memorial Highway (now NY 454) near Islandia—was opened to traffic between 1962 and 1963. A extension of the LIE from Oyster Bay Road to NY 110 opened in August 1962, bringing the highway into Suffolk County. The rest of the highway to Islandia was constructed simultaneously. A extension from NY 110 to Deer Park Road opened in October 1962, followed the next month by another segment from Deer Park Road to Commack Road. A further extension opened to NY 454 in August 1963.

Three more sections of the LIE, from Islandia to exit 71 near Riverhead, were completed in 1969 and 1970. The segment from Veterans Memorial Highway to Patchogue–Holbrook Road was opened on October 27, 1966, by governor Nelson Rockefeller. The discontinuous section of highway between William Floyd Parkway and exit 71 opened in June 1969 and was extended west to Holbrook in December 1969. A segment between Horseblock Road and Holbrook, connecting the two sections of the LIE, continued for several months. After this section opened on June 9, 1970, the LIE was continuous between Manhattan and Riverhead. There were delays in constructing the easternmost of the LIE from exit 71 to CR 58. The extension to CR 58 opened to traffic on June 28, 1972.

===Modifications===
Officials had originally predicted that the LIE would carry 80,000 vehicles per day by 1970. In part because of induced demand, the highway was ineffective in reducing traffic. By 1962, the LIE had reached its peak capacity, carrying between 125,000 and 150,000 vehicles per day. Officials considered constructing four reversible lanes above the existing highway in Queens; this plan would have cost about $100 million (equivalent to $ in ). New York City&#x27;s commissioner of highways also proposed constructing a monorail to alleviate congestion on I-495 in Queens. These plans did not come to fruition, and, by the late 1960s, average rush-hour speeds were about . The Queens section of I-495 alone carried 180,000 vehicles per day. Major chokepoints existed at the interchanges with I-278, the Grand Central Parkway, I-678, I-295, and the Cross Island Parkway. The westbound roadway between Junction Boulevard and 108th Street also suffered from severe congestion, as did the eastbound roadway near Springfield Boulevard. By 1972, the highway was being used by over 150,000 vehicles a day.

State officials announced plans to designate the segment of the LIE east of I-295 as an Interstate highway following the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials did not formally extend the I-495 designation from New York City to Riverhead until May 1984. Subsequently, the entirety of the LIE was designated as I-495.

==== Additional lanes in Queens ====

The ramp from the westbound I-495 to the westbound I-278 in Queens was so congested that a traffic light was installed on that ramp in 1962. State officials planned to reconstruct the interchange, although the project was delayed for several years. In addition, they planned to build a six-lane viaduct above the existing highway between I-278 and 58th Street, which would carry traffic to and from the Queens–Midtown Tunnel. In 1966, the New York City Board of Estimate approved plans to reconstruct the interchange with I-278 as a cloverleaf interchange; the project was planned to cost around $70 million (equivalent to $ in ) and take three years. State officials awarded a contract for the project in June 1967, and work began that October. A ramp from the eastbound I-495 to I-278 opened in 1968. Starting in 1971, one lane of I-495 between the Queens–Midtown Tunnel and Maurice Avenue was converted to a westbound HOV and bus lane during the morning rush hour.

Plans to widen I-495 between I-278 and I-678 were announced by New York City mayor John Lindsay in January 1968. Two additional local lanes would be built beside the three existing lanes in each direction. The plans were postponed in 1974 after state voters failed to approve a bond issue that would have funded the project. By 1976, officials were again seeking to widen I-495 using federal funds. The federal government gave $270 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the widening of I-495 in the 1970s, but the state government decided in 1978 to divide this funding among several projects. The state allocated $80 million (equivalent to $ in ) to improve medians and widen shoulders on I-495 in Queens. By the 1980s, the stretch of I-495 between I-278 and the Grand Central Parkway was frequently carrying 110 percent of its capacity, and there were frequent accidents. In 1981, officials proposed several improvements for that highway segment, including adding a two-lane grade-separated service road between the two highways, realigning service roads at 69th and 108th streets, and improving entrance and exit ramps.

==== Lighting and the HOV lanes ====
Initially, I-495 lacked street lights in Nassau and Suffolk counties. As early as 1969, the county executive for Nassau County had advocated for the installation of street lights along a stretch of the LIE within that county. Despite constant requests from Nassau County officials, no immediate plans were made until 1980, when the first streetlights were installed in eastern Nassau County. The state government planned to add about 1,425 lamps between the Queens–Nassau border and NY 112 (exit 64) since that segment of I-495 was heavily used. East of NY 112, vehicle usage dropped sharply, so no lights were planned. The final streetlights were installed in 2002.

As early as October 1968, state officials had wanted to widen the highway between I-295 and NY 135 from 6 to 10 lanes. In late 1988, the New York state government proposed adding a fourth lane in each direction to I-495 between Jericho and Medford. Following the passage of a $3-billion (equivalent to $ in ) bond issue that year, the state proposed marking the additional lanes as HOV lanes. The state approved the construction of these lanes east of the Cross Island Parkway in 1991. The lanes were built in sections. The first section to open, a section in western Suffolk County, was opened in May 1994; two additional sections opened in 1998 and 1999. The lanes soon became well known due to a combination of advertising and free publicity in news articles, and they were heavily patronized even outside of peak hours. The lanes were completed on June 30, 2005, at which point they ran from exit 32 in eastern Queens to exit 64 at Medford in Suffolk County. The lanes had cost $880 million (equivalent to $ in ) in total. NYSDOT officials estimated that, during rush hours, it would take 45 minutes to travel between exits 32 and 64 using the HOV lanes, as opposed to 90 to 120 minutes using the general-purpose lanes.

Construction of the HOV lanes within Queens was delayed due to opposition from local officials and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The HOV segment in Queens was canceled altogether in 1998, when Governor George Pataki announced that the additional lanes between exits 30 and 32 in Queens would be entrance and exit lanes, rather than HOV lanes. The HOV project would have rebuilt many bridges along I-495 between exits 33 and 40 in Nassau County. As a concession to homeowners, the HOV lanes were narrowed and built within the existing roadbed, and the bridges were largely kept as is.

==== Late 1990s to present ====

Starting in 1998, I-495 was rebuilt between exit 15 (Van Dam Street) and exit 22 (Grand Central Parkway). The renovation cost $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) and entailed renovating the highway&#x27;s main and service roads, improving bridges, and replacing drains. The service roads for exit 19 were rebuilt between 74th Street and Queens Boulevard. There were also plans to rebuild westbound exit 16 to Greenpoint Avenue in Long Island City.

The state announced a plan to renovate I-495 in the vicinity of Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway in 1995. In 2000, Pataki and New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that this segment of I-495 between exits 29 and 32, near Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway, would be rebuilt at a cost of $112 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project was announced after the cancelation of the HOV lanes within Queens. Work started in August 2000 and was substantially completed by 2005. The project included the restoration of within the park, as well as the construction of new ramps to and from the Cross Island Parkway at exit 30. As part of the reconstruction, two cloverleaf ramps were replaced with flyovers, the shoulders in each direction were converted into travel lanes, the westbound exit 31 to Douglaston Parkway was closed, and new collector–distributor ramps were installed east of the Cross Island Parkway interchange.

Starting in 2004, NYSDOT examined proposals to reconfigure exit 22 with I-678 and the Grand Central Parkway in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. These included plans to construct direct ramps between the highways, relocating the service roads of I-495 so the mainline expressway could be widened, and rebuilding the at-grade junction between College Point Boulevard and Horace Harding Expressway. The interchange with Grand Central Parkway was rebuilt from early 2015 to February 2018, with the replacement of the three overpasses carrying I-495 over the parkway. The $55-million (equivalent to $ in ) reconstruction included extending merge lanes, replacing and adding lighting, and improving drainage structures.

===Service roads and the proposed interchange===
As I-495 was being built across Long Island, it was specifically designed to accommodate certain topographical conditions and proposed interchanges. Exit 30 was originally a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Cross Island Parkway, while eastbound exit 30S was for Easthampton Boulevard with a connecting ramp to the southbound Cross Island Parkway. Exit 31 was originally a westbound only interchange for Douglaston Parkway; it was later combined with the exit for Little Neck Parkway. Exit 39A was intended for the proposed extension of the Wantagh State Parkway near Powell Road in Old Westbury. It was intended to be a full Y interchange with an east-to-southbound-only offramp and a north-to-westbound-only onramp running beneath Powell Road.

Exit 40 originally had only same-directional offramps under the expressway providing access to realigned sections of NY 25. When exit 41 was originally constructed, it had no south-to-west connecting ramp. Westbound access to the expressway was provided at the nearby exit 40 onramp at NY 25. An alternate design for exit 42 called for it to be similar to the one proposed for NY 135 and the Bethpage State Parkway, and westbound exit 46 was originally a partial cloverleaf. Exit 47 was never built; it had been intended for the extension of the Bethpage State Parkway near Washington Avenue in Plainview. The site of exit 47 is now a truck inspection site between exits 46 and 48, which opened in 2006.

The original right-of-ways for the service roads between exits 48 and 49 were intended to weave around the steep Manetto Hills area of the main road, rather than running parallel to the road as it does today. The land between the service road and the main road was reserved for housing developments. The right-of-way for the original westbound service road still weaves through the development on the north side of the road. Exit 49 was originally a cloverleaf interchange with the outer ramps connecting to the service roads at a point closer to NY 110. This was in preparation for NY 110&#x27;s formerly proposed upgrade into the Broad Hollow Expressway. After the project was canceled in the 1970s, the west-to-northbound onramp was moved to nearby CR 3 (Pinelawn Road), and the original ramp was replaced with a park and ride.

Exit 52 (Commack Road/CR 4) was intended to be moved west to an interchange with the formerly proposed Babylon–Northport Expressway (realigned NY 231) in the vicinity of the two parking areas. These ramps would have been accessible from the service roads. The westbound offramp and service road at exit 54 (Wicks Road/CR 7) originally terminated at the Long Island Motor Parkway, east of Wicks Road. The westbound onramp was squeezed between the northwest corner of the Wicks Road bridge and exit 53. Excessive weaving between exits 52, 53, and 54 caused NYSDOT to combine all three interchanges into one and replace the west-to-southbound offramp to the Sagtikos State Parkway with a flyover ramp. Exit 54 was eliminated during this project. Exit 55A was meant to be a trumpet interchange for the Hauppauge Spur of NY 347, between the Long Island Motor Parkway (exit 55) and NY 111 (exit 56). The service roads were intended to go around the interchange rather than run parallel to the main road. Ramps on the east side of the Long Island Motor Parkway and west side of NY 111 would be eliminated as part of the interchange&#x27;s construction. Between exits 57 and 58, there was a proposed extension of the Northern State Parkway.

Prior to the construction of the interchange with CR 97 (Nicolls Road), exit 62 was for Morris and Waverly avenues eastbound and Morris Avenue westbound. Exit 68 was originally planned to be built as a cloverleaf interchange without collective–distributor roads. Additionally in the 1970s, Suffolk County Department of Public Works proposed an extension of East Main Street in Yaphank (CR 102) that would have terminated at the west end of this interchange.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Suffolk County Planning Department considered extending CR 55 to the Grumman Calverton Naval Air Base between exits 70 and 71. This would have provided an additional interchange known as exit 70A. Exit 71 itself was intended to be a cloverleaf interchange with CR 94 (Nugent Drive) and the Hamptons Spur of the LIE. After the Hamptons Spur proposal was canceled, the plans for exit 71 were altered to call for a complete diamond interchange.

===Extensions of the expressway===
====Across Manhattan ====

Plans for I-495 called for it to extend across Manhattan on the Mid-Manhattan Expressway (MME, also called the Mid-Manhattan Elevated Expressway) to the Lincoln Tunnel, which it would follow into New Jersey and connect to I-95 in Secaucus. The I-495 designation was assigned to the New Jersey approach to the tunnel in anticipation of the MME being completed. However, the project was canceled and the MME was officially removed from I-495 on January 1, 1970. The New Jersey stretch of I-495 became Route 495 in 1979.

Manhattan Borough President Samuel Levy first proposed the MME connector in 1936. The plan called for an expressway link crossing Midtown Manhattan near 34th Street, then, as now, a heavily traveled crosstown surface street. The original idea was a pair of two-lane tunnels, the MME connecting the West Side Highway on Hudson River and the FDR Drive on the East River. By 1949, Moses had proposed a six-lane elevated expressway along 30th Street. The expressway was to have two exits, connecting to the West Side Highway and Lincoln Tunnel on the west side of Manhattan and also to the Queens–Midtown Tunnel and FDR Drive on the east side of the island. It would be constructed within a right-of-way immediately south of 30th Street. The viaduct would require substantial demolition of highrise buildings within Midtown Manhattan. Moses suggested charging tolls on the new roadway, which was estimated to cost $26 million (equivalent to $ in ) to construct, excluding $23 million (equivalent to $ in ) in land acquisition costs.

A later proposal had the roadway situated 10 stories above valuable commercial real estate. Air rights above the expressway would be sold and new highrise buildings would be constructed above the expressway; buildings would be constructed below the viaduct as well. One unusual variation involved running the roadway through the sixth and seventh floors of the Empire State Building. In 1963, plans for the expressway were finalized, and it received the I-495 designation. Beginning from its elevated connections to 12th Avenue (NY 9A) or the West Side Highway, the MME would mostly follow 30th Street east of Ninth Avenue. The expressway would travel east as a six-lane elevated route, 10 stories above the city streets to allow for commercial development both above and below the skyway deck. At Second Avenue, it would swing north for connections with the FDR Drive. Between First and Second avenues, ramps would be constructed to provide access to the Queens–Midtown Tunnel.

On December 22, 1965, TBTA announced that it had purchased a $1 million parcel of land at the northwest corner of Second Avenue and 29th Street as right-of-way that would be needed to construct the MME. Although the project had not yet been approved, the property was purchased because construction of a 20-story building was beginning on the site and TBTA wanted to avoid incurring higher condemnation costs later on if the building was completed and the MME was approved. Upon the suggestion of incoming New York City Parks Commissioner Thomas Hoving, Moses agreed to allow the land to be used as a temporary park before the expressway was built. The park opened in 1967 and was named Vincent F. Albano Jr. Playground in 1989. As of 2024, the property is still owned by TBTA.

On December 28, 1965, Moses announced that the third tube of the Queens–Midtown Tunnel could be constructed without the completion of the new expressway approaches. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this decision was viewed as an unspoken admission by Moses that the approval could not be obtained for the proposed expressways, which included the MME. The I-495 designation was removed from the expressway on January 1, 1970. In 1971, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller removed state plans for the MME, along with about a dozen other highway plans including I-78 through New York City, of which another crosstown highway known as the Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX) was part.

====Across Suffolk County====
Long Island lobbied to extend I-495 east over NY 495. The extension took place in the early 1980s, at which time the NY 495 signs were taken down and I-495 was extended to the east end of the LIE. The section of I-495 in the vicinity of the Lincoln Tunnel was redesignated as NY 495 at this time. The extension of I-495 to Riverhead makes the highway a spur, which should have an odd first digit according to the Interstate Highway System&#x27;s numbering scheme. Even first digits are usually assigned to bypasses, connectors, and beltways, as I-495 was prior to the 1980s. A proposed Long Island Crossing would have extended the LIE across Long Island Sound to I-95 in either Guilford, Connecticut; Old Saybrook, Connecticut; or Westerly, Rhode Island via a series of existing and artificial islands, but a lack of funding as well as public opposition led to the demise of these proposals. CR 48 in Suffolk County was originally intended to become part of the North Fork extension of the LIE.

===Subway line===
A New York City Subway line along the LIE corridor had been proposed in the 1929 and 1939 IND Second System plans as an extension of the BMT Broadway Line east of the 60th Street Tunnel, prior to the construction of the expressway. These were the predecessors to a line proposed in 1968 as part of the Program for Action. It would have split from the IND Queens Boulevard Line west of the Woodhaven Boulevard station and go to Kissena Boulevard via a right-of-way parallel and adjacent to the LIE. In Phase I, it would have gone to Kissena Boulevard at Queens College and, in Phase II, to Fresh Meadows and Bayside. This &quot;Northeastern Queens&quot; line would have been built in conjunction with the planned widening of the expressway. The subway tracks would have been placed under the expressway or its service roads or in the median of a widened LIE in a similar manner to the Blue Line of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;. It had been previously proposed to run the line from the 63rd Street tunnel under Northern Boulevard to Flushing (near the current Flushing–Main Street station), then south under Kissena and Parsons boulevards to meet with the LIE at Queens College.

The LIE line was approved in July 1968. The line was opposed by many residents of the surrounding communities because it would entail widening I-495, which would necessitate the demolition of nearby homes. By 1973, the final design for the Northeast Queens LIE line was published. The LIE line was canceled later that year because state residents had voted against a $3.5-billion (equivalent to $ in ) bond measure that would have paid for five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This was the second time that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971, for $2.5 billion (equivalent to $ in ).

<text>The Roland CompuRhythm CR-78 is a drum machine manufactured by Roland Corporation that was released in 1978. Although primitive by later standards, the CR-78 represented an important advance in drum machine technology at the time, in particular by allowing users to program and store their own drum patterns. 

The wood effect cabinet and preset rhythms of the CR-78 such as &quot;Waltz&quot;, &quot;Bossa Nova&quot; and &quot;Rhumba&quot; suggest that it was seen by its designers as primarily an accompaniment for an electric organ, but the CR-78 became a popular instrument with new wave musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Operation==



The CR-78 uses analog drum voices that sound very little like real percussion instruments. The unit also incorporates an NEC microprocessor to provide digital control of its functions.

Previous Roland drum machines had offered only a selection of preset rhythms. The CR-78&#x27;s key new feature at the time of its introduction was that in addition to offering 34 preset rhythms, it provided four programmable memory locations for storing patterns created by the user. These can be created by using step programming with the WS-1 box, which was available as an optional extra. The four user patterns are stored in RAM memory; when the CR-78 is switched off, the contents of the RAM are maintained by a NiCd rechargeable battery.

The CR-78&#x27;s front panel allows the user to customize the preset rhythms by altering the volume balance between bass and treble sounds, canceling some sounds altogether, and adding &quot;metallic beat&quot; (three filtered square waves that create a distinctive chime timbre). Many of the preset rhythms have a memorable character, and the ability to manipulate them further made the CR-78 a versatile instrument.

No digital control of tempo is provided on the front panel, with only an analog knob for tempo control. However, the CR-78 accepts an external V-trig clock, allowing a control voltage to be fed in from another device such as a music sequencer.

A selection of preset fills and rhythm variations are also available, either to trigger manually, or automatically every 2, 4, 8 or 16 bars.

Roland also produced a simpler drum machine, the CompuRhythm CR-68. This was essentially the same as the CR-78, but without programmable patterns or the ability to fade drum sounds in and out. A large cabinet version, the CompuRhythm CR-800, with capabilities between the CR-68 and CR-78, was also produced. At the same time Roland also sold the TR-66, a smaller unit that offered fewer preset rhythms and no programmability.

== Sounds and rhythms ==
The CR-78&#x27;s built-in rhythm sounds were a further development of those available on the earlier Roland Rhythm 33, 55 and 77 machines.

The analog percussion voices consist of bass drum, snare drum, rim shot, hi-hat, cymbal, maracas, claves, cowbell, high bongo, low bongo, low conga, tambourine, guiro, and &quot;metallic beat&quot; (an accent that could be overlaid on the hi-hat voice). The CR-78 also has an accent control that increases the loudness of certain steps in a pattern.

There are four patterns named &quot;Rock&quot; and two named &quot;Disco&quot;. Other patterns are named &quot;Waltz&quot;, &quot;Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Slow Rock&quot;, &quot;Swing&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Boogie&quot;, &quot;Enka&quot;, &quot;Bossa Nova&quot;, &quot;Samba&quot;, &quot;Mambo&quot;, &quot;Chacha&quot;, &quot;Beguine&quot; and &quot;Rhumba&quot;. Each pattern is available in two variations, labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. It is possible to select more than one rhythm at a time, and also mute drum sounds from a pattern using the balance knob and dedicated cancel buttons.

The CR-78 has been used in songs including &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; by Phil Collins, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; by Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates, &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears For Fears, &quot;Heart Of Glass&quot; by &quot;Blondie&quot;, and in live performances by Radiohead.

<text>State atheism or atheist state is the incorporation of hard atheism or non-theism into political regimes. It is considered the opposite of theocracy and may also refer to large-scale secularization attempts by governments. To some extent, it is a religion-state relationship that is usually ideologically linked to irreligion and the promotion of irreligion or atheism. State atheism may refer to a government&#x27;s promotion of anti-clericalism, which opposes religious institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen. In some instances, religious symbols and public practices that were once held by religions were replaced with secularized versions of them. State atheism in these cases is considered as not being politically neutral toward religion, and therefore it is often considered non-secular.

The majority of communist states followed similar policies from 1917 onwards. The Soviet Union (1922–1991) had a long history of state atheism, whereby those who were seeking social success generally had to profess atheism and stay away from places of worship; this trend became especially militant during the middle of the Stalinist era, which lasted from 1929 to 1953. In Eastern Europe, countries like Bulgaria, East Germany and Czechoslovakia experienced strong state atheism policies. The Soviet Union attempted to suppress public religious expression over wide areas of its influence, including places such as Central Asia. Currently, China, North Korea, and Vietnam, are officially atheist.

Cuba was an atheist state until 2019, when a change in its constitution declared it a secular state.

After the Russian Civil War, the state used its resources to stop the implanting of religious beliefs in nonbelievers and remove &quot;prerevolutionary remnants&quot; which still existed. The Bolsheviks were particularly hostile toward the Russian Orthodox Church (which supported the White Movement during the Russian Civil War) and saw it as a supporter of Tsarist autocracy. During the collectivization of the land, Orthodox priests distributed pamphlets declaring that the Soviet regime was the Antichrist coming to place &quot;the Devil&#x27;s mark&quot; on the peasants, and encouraged them to resist the government. Political repression in the Soviet Union was widespread and while religious persecution was applied to numerous religions, the regime&#x27;s anti-religious campaigns were often directed against specific religions based on state interests. The attitude in the Soviet Union toward religion varied from persecution of some religions to not outlawing others.

From the late 1920s to the late 1930s, such organizations as the League of Militant Atheists ridiculed all religions and harassed believers. The league was a &quot;nominally independent organization established by the Communist Party to promote atheism&quot;. It published its own newspaper, and journals, sponsored lectures, and organized demonstrations that lampooned religion and promoted atheism. Anti-religious and atheistic propaganda was implemented into every portion of soviet life from schools to the media and even on to substituting rituals to replace religious ones. Though Lenin originally introduced the Gregorian calendar to the Soviets, subsequent efforts to reorganise the week to improve worker productivity saw the introduction of the Soviet calendar, which had the side-effect that a &quot;holiday will seldom fall on Sunday&quot;.

Within about a year of the revolution, the state expropriated all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed (a much greater number was subjected to persecution). Most seminaries were closed, and publication of religious writing was banned. A meeting of the Antireligious Commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) that occurred on 23 May 1929 estimated the portion of believers in the USSR at 80 percent, though this percentage may be understated to prove the successfulness of the struggle with religion. The Russian Orthodox Church, which had 54,000 parishes before World War I, was reduced to 500 by 1940. Overall, by that same year 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were either forcibly closed, converted, or destroyed.

Since the Soviet era, Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine and Lithuania have diverse religious affiliations. Russians have primarily returned to 
identifying with the Orthodox Church; by 2008 72% of Russians identified as Orthodox - rising from 31% in 1991. However, Professor Niels Christian Nielsen of philosophy and religious thought of Rice University has written that the post-Soviet population in areas which were formerly predominantly Orthodox are now &quot;nearly illiterate regarding religion&quot;, almost completely lacking the intellectual or philosophical aspects of their faith and having almost no knowledge of other faiths.

In 1928, the Jewish Autonomous Oblast was established by Joseph Stalin, acting on an idea proposed by Lenin in order to give the Jewish population in Russia more personal autonomy, as reparation for antisemitism in the Russian Empire. Along with granting Jewish autonomy, Stalin also allowed Sharia law in the majority-Islamic countries of the Soviet Union. &quot;The Soviet Government considers that the Sharia, as common law, is as fully authorized as that of any other of the peoples inhabiting Russia&quot; (statement by Stalin during the Congress of the Peoples of Dagestan, an autonomous republic in Russia). Art. 135 of the 1936 constitution of the Soviet Union protects individuals from religious discrimination.

===Albania===

In 1967 Enver Hoxha, the head of state of Albania, declared Albania to be the &quot;first atheist state of the world&quot; even though the Soviet Union under Lenin had already been a &quot;de facto&quot; atheist state. Marxist–Leninist authorities in Albania claimed that religion was foreign to Albania and used this to justify their policy of state atheism and suppression of religion. This nationalism was also used to justify the communist stance of state atheism from 1967 to 1991. 

Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, &quot;The state recognizes no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people.&quot; 

Catholic priest Shtjefen Kurti was executed for secretly baptizing a child in Shkodër in 1972.

In 1990, the policy of state atheism was repealed. The 1998 Constitution of Albania defined the country as a parliamentary republic, and established personal and political rights and freedoms, including protection against coercion in matters of religious belief. Albania is a member state of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the 2011 census found that 58.79% of Albanians adhere to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are secular Sunnis along with a significant Bektashi Shia minority. Christianity is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the 2nd largest religion in the country. The remaining population is either irreligious or belongs to other religious groups. In 2011, Albania&#x27;s population was estimated to be 56.7% Muslim, 10% Roman Catholic, 6.8% Orthodox, 2.5% atheist, 2.1% Bektashi (a Sufi order), 5.7% other, 16.2% unspecified. In the Gallup Global Reports 2010 survey, when asked whether religion is an important part of daily life, 39% of Albanians responded &quot;yes&quot; and 53% &quot;no&quot;, which placed Albania in the lowest quartile of countries ranked by &quot;yes&quot; responses. The U.S. state department reports that in 2013, &quot;There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice.&quot;

===Cambodia===

The Khmer Rouge actively persecuted Buddhists during their rule of Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. Buddhist institutions and temples were destroyed and Buddhist monks and teachers were killed in large numbers. A third of the country&#x27;s monasteries were destroyed along with numerous holy texts and items of high artistic quality. 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime, which was officially an atheist state. The persecution was undertaken because Pol Pot believed that Buddhism was &quot;a decadent affectation&quot;. He sought to eliminate Buddhism&#x27;s 1,500-year-old mark on Cambodia.

Under the Khmer Rouge, all religious practices were banned. According to Ben Kiernan, &quot;the Khmer Rouge repressed Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism, but its fiercest extermination campaign was directed against the ethnic Cham Muslim minority.&quot;

===China===
China has adopted a policy of official state atheism. Art. 36 of the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom of religion but it only allows members of state sanctioned organizations to practice religions. The government has promoted atheism throughout the country. In April 2016, the General Secretary, Xi Jinping, stated that members of the Chinese Communist Party must be &quot;unyielding Marxist atheists&quot;; in the same month, a government-sanctioned demolition work crew drove a bulldozer over two Chinese Christians who protested against the demolition of their church by refusing to step aside, resulting in death of a woman. Two members of the church demolition crew were later detained by police.

Traditionally, a large segment of the Chinese population practiced Chinese folk religions and Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. As a result, all of these religions had played a significant role in the everyday lives of ordinary people. After the 1949 Chinese Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party took power. For much of its early history, that government maintained under Marxist thought that religion would ultimately disappear, and characterized it as emblematic of feudalism and foreign colonialism.

During the Cultural Revolution, student vigilantes who were known as Red Guards converted religious buildings into buildings which were used for secular purposes or they destroyed them. However, this attitude relaxed considerably in the late 1970s, during the reform and opening up period. The 1978 Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China guaranteed freedom of religion with a number of restrictions. Since then, there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.

The CCP has said that religious beliefs and membership in it are incompatible. However, the state is not allowed to force ordinary citizens to become atheists. China&#x27;s five officially sanctioned religious organizations are the Buddhist Association of China, Chinese Taoist Association, Islamic Association of China, Three-Self Patriotic Movement and Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. These groups are afforded a degree of protection, but are subject to restrictions and controls under the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Unregistered religious groups face varying degrees of harassment. The constitution permits what is called &quot;normal religious activities,&quot; so long as they do not involve the use of religion to &quot;engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.&quot;

Article 36 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China of 1982 specifies that:
Most people report no organized religious affiliation; however, people with a belief in folk traditions and spiritual beliefs, such as ancestor veneration and feng shui, along with informal ties to local temples and unofficial house churches number in the hundreds of millions. In its annual report on International Religious Freedom, the United States Department of State provides statistics about organized religions. In 2007, it reported the following (citing the Government&#x27;s 1997 report on Religious Freedom and 2005 White Paper on religion):

:*Buddhists 8%.
:*Taoists, unknown as a percentage partly because it is practiced along with Confucianism and Buddhism.
:*Muslims, 1%, with more than 20,000 Imams. Other estimates state that at least 1% of China&#x27;s population is Muslim.
:*Christians, Protestants, at least 2%. Catholics, about 1%.

To some degree, statistics which are related to Buddhism and religious Taoism are incomparable to statistics for Islam and Christianity. This fact is due to the traditional Chinese belief system which blends Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, so a person who follows a traditional belief system would not exclusively identify as a Buddhist or a Taoist, even though he or she would attend Buddhist or Taoist places of worship. According to Peter Ng, Professor of the Department of Religion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, , 95% of Chinese were religious in some way if religion is believed to include traditional folk practices such as burning incense for gods or ancestors at life-cycle or seasonal festivals, fortune telling and related customary practices.

The U.S. State Department has designated China as a &quot;country of particular concern&quot; since 1999. Freedom House classifies Tibet and Xinjiang as regions of particular repression of religion, due to concerns about separatist activity. Heiner Bielefeldt, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, says that China&#x27;s actions against the Uighurs are &quot;a major problem&quot;. The Chinese government has denounced the report, stating that China has &quot;ample&quot; religious freedom.

===Cuba===

Until 1992, Cuba was officially an atheist state.

In August 1960, several bishops signed a joint pastoral letter condemning communism and declaring it incompatible with Catholicism, and calling on Catholics to reject it. Fidel Castro gave a four-hour long speech the next day, condemning priests who serve &quot;great wealth&quot; and using fears of Falangist influence in order to attack Spanish-born priests, declaring &quot;There is no doubt that Franco has a sizeable group of fascist priests in Cuba.&quot;

Originally more tolerant of religion, the Cuban government began arresting many believers and shutting down religious schools after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Its prisons were being filled with clergy since the 1960s. In 1961, the Cuban government confiscated Catholic schools, including the Jesuit school that Fidel Castro had attended. In 1965 it exiled two hundred priests.

In 1976, the Constitution of Cuba added a clause stating that the &quot;socialist state...bases its activity on, and educates the people in, the scientific materialist concept of the universe&quot;. In 1992, the dissolution of the Soviet Union led the country to declare itself a secular state. Pope John Paul II contributed to the Cuban thaw when he paid a historic visit to the island in 1998 and criticized the US embargo. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 2012 and Pope Francis visited Cuba in 2015. The Cuban government continued hostile actions against religious groups; having ordered, in 2015 alone, the closure or demolition of over 100 Pentecostal, Methodist, and Baptist parishes, according to a report from Christian Solidarity Worldwide. While the Cuban constitution now recognizes freedom of religion, the law is still silent on the issue of church construction. This vagueness allowed authorities in some areas to prohibit the construction of new churches, but allowing to lead services inside their homes and in religious buildings erected before the Cuban revolution. Despite the difficults in constructing new churches, there&#x27;s been a boom in evangelical worship, with tens of thousands of Cubans worshipping unmolested across the island each week.

===East Germany===

Though Article 39 of the GDR constitution of 1968 guarantees religious freedom, the state&#x27;s policy was oriented towards the promotion of atheism. Eastern Germany practiced heavy secularization. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) generated antireligous regulations and promoted atheism for decades which impacted the growth of citizens affiliating with no religion from 7.6% in 1950 to 60% in 1986. It was in the 1950s that scientific atheism became official state policy when Soviet authorities were setting up a communist government. the area of the former German Democratic Republic was the least religious region in the world.

===North Korea===

The North Korean constitution states that freedom of religion is permitted. However, the North Korean government&#x27;s &quot;Juche&quot; ideology has been described as &quot;state-sanctioned atheism&quot; and atheism is the government&#x27;s official position. According to a 2018 CIA report, free religious activities almost no longer exist, with government-sponsored groups to delude them. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom stated that assessing the situation in North Korea is challenging, but reports which state that DPRK officials repress religious activities have surfaced, including reports which state that the government forms and controls religious organizations in an attempt to restrict the performance of religious activities. In 2004, the Human Rights Overview reported that North Korea remains one of the most repressive governments, with isolation and disregard for international law making monitoring almost impossible. After 1,500 churches were destroyed during the rule of Kim Il Sung from 1948 to 1994, three churches were built in Pyongyang. Foreign residents who regularly attend services at these churches have reported that the services which are performed there are staged for their benefit.

The North Korean government promotes the cult of personality of Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, described as a political religion, as well as the &quot;Juche&quot; ideology, based on Korean ultranationalism, which calls on people to &quot;avoid spiritual deference to outside influences&quot;, which was interpreted as including religions which originated outside Korea.

Since 2001, the U.S. State Department has designated North Korea as a &quot;country of particular concern&quot;, due to its violations of religious freedom. Cardinal Nicolas Cheong Jin-suk has said that, &quot;There&#x27;s no knowledge of priests surviving persecution that came in the late forties, when 166 priests and religious were killed or kidnapped,&quot; which includes the Roman Catholic bishop of Pyongyang, Francis Hong Yong-ho. In November 2013, it was reported that the repression of religious people led to the public execution of 80 people, some of them were executed for possessing Bibles.

There are five Christian churches in Pyongyang, three of them are Protestant, one of them is Eastern Orthodox, and one of them is Catholic. President Kim Il Sung and his mother were frequent patrons of the Chilgol Church, one of the Protestant churches, and that church can be visited on tours. Christian institutions are regulated by the Korean Christian Federation, a state-controlled religious organization. Chondoism is an indigenous religion in Korea, and the Chondoist Chongu Party is part of the ruling front in North Korea, but the number of Chondoists in North Korea is unknown.

===Mongolia===

The Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) propagated atheism until the 1960s. In the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, after it was invaded by Japanese troops in 1936, the Soviet Union deployed its troops there in 1937, undertaking an offensive against the Buddhist religion. Parallel with this, a Soviet-style purge was launched in the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party and the Mongolian army. The Mongol leader at that time was Khorloogiin Choibalsan, a follower of Joseph Stalin, who emulated many of the policies that Stalin had previously implemented in the Soviet Union. The purge virtually succeeded in eliminating Tibetan Buddhism and cost an estimated thirty to thirty-five thousand lives. More than 700 monasteries were demolished.

===Vietnam===

Officially, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is an atheist state as declared by its communist government. Art. 24 of the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam recognizes religious freedom.

==Non-communist states==

===Revolutionary Mexico===
Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 as originally enacted included anticlerical provisions and restricted religious freedoms. The Articles were initially seldom enforced until President Plutarco Elías Calles, who sought to enact the separation of church and state established in the Constitution of 1917, took office in 1924. Calles&#x27; Mexico has been characterized as an atheist state and his program as aiming to eradicate religious practices in Mexico during the 20th century.

There was an expulsion of foreign clergy and expropriation of Church properties. Article 27 prohibited any future acquisition of such property by churches, and prohibited religious corporations and ministers from establishing or directing primary schools. The Constitution of 1917 also forbade the existence of monastic orders (Article 5) and religious activities outside of church buildings (which became government property), and mandated that such religious activities would be overseen by government (Article 24).

On 14 June 1926, President Calles enacted anticlerical legislation known formally as The Law Reforming the Penal Code and unofficially as Calles Law. His anti-Catholic actions included outlawing religious orders, depriving the Church of property rights and depriving the clergy of civil liberties, including their right to a trial by jury in cases involving anti-clerical laws and the right to vote. Catholic antipathy towards Calles was enhanced because of his vocal anti-Catholicism.
Due to the strict enforcement of anticlerical laws, people in strongly Catholic states, especially Jalisco, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Colima and Michoacán, began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the Cristero War from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by atrocities on both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, including the torture and killing of public school teachers, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals.

A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow. Calles, however, in violation of its terms did not abide by the truce and he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children. Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles&#x27; insistence on a state monopoly on education, suppressing Catholic education and introducing socialist education in its place: &quot;We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.&quot; Persecutions continued as Calles maintained control under the Maximato and did not relent until 1940, when President Manuel Ávila Camacho took office. Attempts to eliminate religious education became more pronounced in 1934 through an amendment of Article 3 of the Mexican Constitution, which strived to eliminate religion by mandating &quot;socialist education&quot;, which &quot;in addition to removing all religious doctrine&quot; would &quot;combat fanaticism and prejudices&quot;, &quot;build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life&quot;. In 1946, socialist education provisions were removed from the constitution and new laws promoted secular education. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Where there were 4,500 priests operating within the country before the War, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been killed, exiled or not obtaining licenses. In 1935, 17 states had no registered priests.

=== Revolutionary France ===

The French Revolution initially began with attacks on Church corruption and the wealth of the higher clergy, an action with which even many Christians could identify, since the Gallican Church held a dominant role in pre-revolutionary France. During a two-year period known as the Reign of Terror, the episodes of anti-clericalism grew more violent than any in modern European history. The new revolutionary authorities suppressed the Church, abolished the Catholic monarchy, nationalized Church property, exiled 30,000 priests, and killed hundreds more. In October 1793, the Christian calendar was replaced with one reckoned from the date of the Revolution, and Festivals of Liberty, Reason, and the Supreme Being were scheduled. New forms of moral religion emerged, including the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and the atheistic Cult of Reason, with the revolutionary government briefly mandating observance of the former in April 1794.

==Human rights==

Antireligious states, including atheist states, have been at odds with international human rights law. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is designed to protect freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN&#x27;s human rights committee declared that article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &quot;protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief.&quot; The committee further stated that &quot;the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#x27;s current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views.&quot; Signatories to the convention are barred from &quot;the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers&quot; to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions were still being persecuted in many parts of the world.

Theodore Roosevelt condemned the Kishinev pogrom in 1903, establishing a history of U.S. presidents commenting on the internal religious liberty of foreign countries. In Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s 1941 State of the Union address, he outlined Four Freedoms, including Freedom of worship, that would be foundation for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and future U.S. diplomatic efforts. Jimmy Carter asked Deng Xiaoping to improve religious freedom in China, and Ronald Reagan told US Embassy staff in Moscow to help Jews harassed by the Soviet authorities. Bill Clinton established the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, in order to use diplomacy to promote religious liberty in repressive states. Countries like Albania had anti-religious policies, while also promoting atheism, that impacted their religious rights.

<text>Markku Uusipaavalniemi (born 23 November 1966) is a Finnish curler and former politician.

==Curling career==
Uusipaavalniemi was the skip of Team Finland for the first time in the mid-1990s. Most (but not all) of Finland&#x27;s curling medals have been achieved with Uusipaavalniemi as skip. Uusipaavalniemi&#x27;s team won the European Championships in 2000. He is also a two-time World Curling Championships bronze medalist (1998 and 2000) and two-time European Curling Championships bronze medalist (1999 and 2001).

Uusipaavalniemi&#x27;s Finland team disappointingly finished fifth at the 2002 Olympic Games.

In 2004, he and his somewhat altered Finland line-up pulled off the daunting task of securing qualification for the 2005 Ford World Men&#x27;s Curling Championships from the &#x27;B&#x27; competition at the European championships, where they languished following the country&#x27;s relegation the previous season. To do this, they had to win the competition outright, and then overcome Russia in an additional play-off match.
At the 2005 World Championship, Uusipaavalniemi&#x27;s team finished the round-robin tied for first place with five other teams on an 8–3 record. In the tie-breakers however, they were knocked out of contention by Canada&#x27;s Randy Ferbey. Also in 2005, Uusipaavalniemi won the first ever European Mixed Curling Championship with teammates Kirsi Nykänen, Teemu Salo and Tiina Kautonen in Andorra.

Uusipaavalniemi&#x27;s Finland team finished the round-robin at the 2006 Olympic tournament in first place, with a 7–2 record. They beat Great Britain 4–3 in the semi-final, with the last stone of the final end — thrown by Uusipaavalniemi — giving the Finns the deciding point. Finland lost the final to Canada 10-4 taking the silver medal.

Two weeks before the start of the 2006 World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship in Lowell, Massachusetts, Uusipaavalniemi suffered a wrist injury that forced him to miss the team&#x27;s first three games of the competition. He recovered enough to start playing in the fourth game, where he skipped and threw second rocks. He played out the rest of the competition throwing third rocks, but Finland did not make the playoff round, finishing tied for fifth with a 6–5 record.

Uusipaavalniemi returned to the 2007 Ford World Men&#x27;s Curling Championship but his team got off to a rough start, losing their first two games and stringing together back-to-back wins only twice. Finland qualified for a tiebreaker with a 6–5 record, but lost to Germany 8-5 and finished sixth. Markku admitted that his recent campaign for (and eventual election to) Finnish parliament had forced him to cut back on curling practice time, perhaps contributing to the team&#x27;s early struggles.

After the 2007 World Championships Uusipaavalniemi didn&#x27;t play at a competitive level until he returned to curling in the 2009–10 season with a new team. The new team won the Finnish Championship in the 2010–11 curling season and represented Finland in 2011 European Curling Championships. The appearance in the 2011 Europeans was a disappointment when Finland finished 7th in the B-group.

==Political career==
On 20 September 2006 Uusipaavalniemi announced his candidacy for Finnish parliament in the 2007 election for the Centre Party.. Uusipaavalniemi was elected along with three other members of his party from the Uusimaa constituency.
He voted against the further privatization of government owned companies as well as against the Lisbon treaty, both of which were supported by the party.

On 11 November 2010 Uusipaavalniemi defected from the Centre Party and joined the ranks of the True Finns Party. He was not reelected in the 2011 election.

==Personal life==
Uusipaavalniemi lives in Helsinki. He is divorced and has three children. His older brother Jussi taught him how to curl.

* Colin Campbell Award: 1998, 2003
* Markku of the Year, 2002. The award is given by an association of people named Markku.

<doc id="844783" wikidata="Q2646117" url="?curid=844783" title="Forgetful functor">
<text>In mathematics, in the area of category theory, a forgetful functor (also known as a stripping functor) &#x27;forgets&#x27; or drops some or all of the input&#x27;s structure or properties &#x27;before&#x27; mapping to the output. For an algebraic structure of a given signature, this may be expressed by curtailing the signature: the new signature is an edited form of the old one. If the signature is left as an empty list, the functor is simply to take the underlying set of a structure. Because many structures in mathematics consist of a set with an additional added structure, a forgetful functor that maps to the underlying set is the most common case. 

==Overview==
As an example, there are several forgetful functors from the category of commutative rings. A (unital) ring, described in the language of universal algebra, is an ordered tuple formula_1 satisfying certain axioms, where formula_2 and formula_3 are binary functions on the set formula_4, formula_5 is a unary operation corresponding to additive inverse, and 0 and 1 are nullary operations giving the identities of the two binary operations. Deleting the 1 gives a forgetful functor to the category of rings without unit; it simply &quot;forgets&quot; the unit. Deleting formula_3 and 1 yields a functor to the category of abelian groups, which assigns to each ring formula_4 the underlying additive abelian group of formula_4. To each morphism of rings is assigned the same function considered merely as a morphism of addition between the underlying groups. Deleting all the operations gives the functor to the underlying set formula_4.

It is beneficial to distinguish between forgetful functors that &quot;forget structure&quot; versus those that &quot;forget properties&quot;. For example, in the above example of commutative rings, in addition to those functors that delete some of the operations, there are functors that forget some of the axioms. There is a functor from the category CRing to Ring that forgets the axiom of commutativity, but keeps all the operations. Occasionally the object may include extra sets not defined strictly in terms of the underlying set (in this case, which part to consider the underlying set is a matter of taste, though this is rarely ambiguous in practice). For these objects, there are forgetful functors that forget the extra sets that are more general.

Most common objects studied in mathematics are constructed as underlying sets along with extra sets of structure on those sets (operations on the underlying set, privileged subsets of the underlying set, etc.) which may satisfy some axioms. For these objects, a commonly considered forgetful functor is as follows.
Let formula_10 be any category based on sets, e.g. groups—sets of elements—or topological spaces—sets of &#x27;points&#x27;. As usual, write formula_11 for the objects of formula_10 and write formula_13 for the morphisms of the same. Consider the rule:
:For all formula_14 in formula_15 the underlying set of formula_16
:For all formula_17 in formula_18 the morphism, formula_17, as a map of sets.
The functor formula_20 is then the forgetful functor from formula_10 to Set, the category of sets.

Forgetful functors are almost always faithful. Concrete categories have forgetful functors to the category of sets—indeed they may be &quot;defined&quot; as those categories that admit a faithful functor to that category.

Forgetful functors that only forget axioms are always fully faithful, since every morphism that respects the structure between objects that satisfy the axioms automatically also respects the axioms. Forgetful functors that forget structures need not be full; some morphisms don&#x27;t respect the structure. These functors are still faithful however because distinct morphisms that do respect the structure are still distinct when the structure is forgotten. Functors that forget the extra sets need not be faithful, since distinct morphisms respecting the structure of those extra sets may be indistinguishable on the underlying set.

In the language of formal logic, a functor of the first kind removes axioms, a functor of the second kind removes predicates, and a functor of the third kind remove types. An example of the first kind is the forgetful functor Ab → Grp. One of the second kind is the forgetful functor Ab → Set. A functor of the third kind is the functor Mod → Ab, where Mod is the fibred category of all modules over arbitrary rings. To see this, just choose a ring homomorphism between the underlying rings that does not change the ring action. Under the forgetful functor, this morphism yields the identity. Note that an object in Mod is a tuple, which includes a ring and an abelian group, so which to forget is a matter of taste.

== Left adjoints of forgetful functors ==
Forgetful functors tend to have left adjoints, which are &#x27;free&#x27; constructions. For example:
* free module: the forgetful functor from formula_22 (the category of formula_4-modules) to formula_24 has left adjoint formula_25, with formula_26, the free formula_4-module with basis formula_28.
* free group
* free lattice
* tensor algebra
* free category, adjoint to the forgetful functor from categories to quivers
* universal enveloping algebra

For a more extensive list, see (Mac Lane 1997).

As this is a fundamental example of adjoints, we spell it out:
adjointness means that given a set &quot;X&quot; and an object (say, an &quot;R&quot;-module) &quot;M&quot;, maps &quot;of sets&quot; formula_29 correspond to maps of modules formula_30: every map of sets yields a map of modules, and every map of modules comes from a map of sets.

In the case of vector spaces, this is summarized as:
&quot;A map between vector spaces is determined by where it sends a basis, and a basis can be mapped to anything.&quot;

Symbolically:
:formula_31

The unit of the free–forgetful adjunction is the &quot;inclusion of a basis&quot;: formula_32.

Fld, the category of fields, furnishes an example of a forgetful functor with no adjoint. There is no field satisfying a free universal property for a given set.

<text>Car donation is the practice of giving away unwanted used automobiles or other vehicles to charitable organizations. In the United States, these donations can provide a tax benefit to the donor.

==In the United States==

===Tax considerations===
Donors need to fulfil certain post-donation requirements to qualify for the tax deduction, such as obtaining a written acknowledgment of the car&#x27;s subsequent sale by the charity, and itemizing tax returns instead of taking the standard deduction.

For vehicles valued at less than $500, the deduction amount comes from the donor&#x27;s own estimate of the car&#x27;s value, even if the charity receives less money from its sale. Deductions greater than $500 are limited to the proceeds of selling the vehicle, usually at auction. The U.S Internal Revenue Service advises that starting in 2005:

==In the United Kingdom==
Car donation schemes in the UK are slightly different from those operating in the United States and only established themselves as a valued source of income for UK charities in January 2010, led by GiveACar – a non-profit organization. Operating as a non-profit organization allows charities to avoid the large overheads created by profit-making car donation companies. In addition, whereas car donation in the US has been incentivized through tax breaks, in the UK there are no such tax benefits to donating your car.

==Practices==
Vehicle donations in America are operated in a wide variety of plans, ranging from highly organized and professional-grade not-for-profit, national, or local charities to scrap yards, haulers, tow-truck companies and salvagers who establish programs that may support a charity. According to Charity Navigator, the guidance of the rating agencies concerning car donation programs, where the charity receives a flat fee for the use of their name by a third party, versus program management by a third party, there are some questionable companies who contract to use a nonprofit&#x27;s agencies name and logo to raise funds and then just give them a flat fee unrelated to income or performance. This is frowned upon by rating agencies and the government. However, a percentage return program is viewed positively if the nonprofit receives more than 50% of the generated income.

<doc id="844787" wikidata="Q2142411" url="?curid=844787" title="Fast chess">
<text>Fast chess, also known as speed chess, is a type of chess in which each player is given less time to consider their moves than classical chess time controls allow. Fast chess is subdivided, by decreasing time controls, into rapid chess, blitz chess, and bullet chess. Armageddon chess is a variant of fast chess with draw odds for black and unequal time controls, used as a tiebreaker of last resort.

As of January 2025, the top-ranked rapid chess player and the top-ranked blitz chess player in the open section is Magnus Carlsen from Norway, who is also the top-ranked classical chess player. The reigning World Rapid Chess Champion is Volodar Murzin of Russia. The reigning World Blitz Chess Champions are Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia (who shared victory in 2024).

As of January 2025, Ju Wenjun of China is the women&#x27;s top-ranked rapid player, who is also the reigning Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion in classical chess and the reigning Women&#x27;s World Blitz Chess Champion. The women&#x27;s top-ranked blitz player and also the top-ranked classical chess player is Hou Yifan, also from China. The reigning Women&#x27;s World Rapid Chess Champion is Koneru Humpy of India.

== FIDE rules ==
The World Chess Federation (FIDE) divides time controls for chess into &quot;classical&quot; time controls, and the fast chess time controls. , for master-level players (with an Elo of 2400 or higher) the regulations state that at least 120 minutes per player (based on a 60-move game) must be allocated for a game to be rated on the &quot;classical&quot; list; for lower-rated players, this can be reduced to as little as 60 minutes. Games played faster than these time controls can be rated for rapid and blitz if they comply with the time controls for those categories.

Players of fast and blitz chess are exempt from the requirement to record their moves onto a scoresheet (A.2). The arbiter or their assistant is responsible for the recording in competitions (A.3.1.2, B.3.1.2). Electronic recording is preferred.

== Overview ==
A fast chess game can be further divided into several categories, which are primarily distinguished by the selection of time controls. Games may be played with or without time increments per move.

=== Rapid (FIDE), quick (USCF), or active===
Time controls for each player in a game of rapid chess are, according to FIDE, more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes. Rapid chess can be played with or without time increments for each move. When time increments are used, a player can automatically gain, for instance, ten more seconds on the clock after each move. When time increments are used, the total time per player for a 60-move game must be more than 10 minutes but less than 60 minutes. Rapid chess was called &quot;active chess&quot; by FIDE between 1987 and 1989.

For the FIDE World Rapid Championship, each player has 15 minutes plus 10 seconds additional time per move starting from move 1.

=== Blitz ===
Time controls for each player in a game of blitz chess are, according to FIDE, 10 minutes or less per player. This can be played with or without an increment or delay per move, made possible by the adoption of digital clocks. Three minutes with a two-second increment is preferred. In the case of time increments, the total time per player for a 60-move game must be 10 minutes or less (hence averaging 10 seconds or less per move).

For the FIDE World Blitz Championship, each player has 3 minutes plus 2 additional seconds per move, starting from move 1.

=== Bullet ===
Bullet chess games have less than three minutes per player, based on a 40-move game; some chess servers rate one-minute-per-player games separately. Lower time controls are called &quot;hyperbullet&quot; and &quot;ultrabullet&quot; for 30-second-per-player and 15-second-per-player games, respectively. Other common time-control options for bullet games include two minutes with one-second increment, one minute with a two-second increment, or one minute with one-second increment. The term &quot;lightning&quot; can also be applied to this variant. The use of increment in bullet chess is primarily to avoid issues with latency, as well to discourage playing from a lost position in order to win on time (also known as &quot;dirty flagging&quot;).

Online bullet chess avoids practical problems associated with live bullet chess, particularly players accidentally knocking over the pieces. Playing online also allows premoving, or committing to a move before the opponent has taken their turn.

=== Armageddon ===
A variant of blitz chess where a drawn game is counted as a win for Black. This guarantees the game ends decisively, so it can be used as a final tiebreaker game. It was used in tournaments such as the Chess World Cup as a tiebreaker.

To compensate for giving Black draw odds, White has more time on the clock. Common times are six minutes for White and five minutes for Black or five minutes for White and four minutes for Black. This can also be played with a small increment. If there is no increment, then difficult questions arise when players must try to flag in trivial draws, which happened in the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship 2008 in the match between Monika Soćko and Sabina-Francesca Foisor. With a small increment, the time odds need to be larger to keep the situation balanced: Norway Chess has used 10 minutes to 7 minutes.

Some tournaments utilise a bidding system for individual players of each match to decide how little time they would be willing to play with as black. The player with the lower bid for each match receives the black pieces with draw odds. This system minimises the perceived unfairness of Armageddon time controls that are decided in advance before a tournament with colours randomly allocated. Such an idea is reminiscent of the logical use case of fair cake-cutting.

Armageddon chess does not scale well to slower time controls, as even in rapid the necessary time odds would need to be too large; in correspondence events or engine vs. engine events, it is simply unworkable. Larry Kaufman, Kai Laskos, and Stephen Pohl have tested using engines (Stockfish, Komodo, and Houdini) an alternative solution, allowing for equal times: Black has draw odds, but is not allowed to castle short. Engine tests suggest that this is fair, although it has yet to be tried in practice by human grandmasters.

== History and rules ==
Before the advent of digital clocks, five minutes per side was the standard for blitz or speed chess. Before the introduction of chess clocks, chess club &quot;rapid transit&quot; tournaments had referees who called out every ten seconds. The Washington Divan (2445 15th St. NW) had regular weekly games and used a special clock that beeped every ten seconds to indicate the time to move. Players had to use their full ten seconds and move on the bell.

In 1988, Walter Browne formed the World Blitz Chess Association and its magazine &quot;Blitz Chess&quot;, which folded in 2003.

In some chess tournaments and matches, the final standings of the contestants are decided by a series of games with ever-shortening control times as tie breaks. In this case, two games may be played with each time control, as playing with black or white pieces is not equally liked among players. The short time controls in fast chess reduce the amount of time available to consider each move, and may result in a frantic game, especially as time runs out. A player whose time runs out automatically loses, unless the opposing player has insufficient material to checkmate, in which case the game is a draw. &quot;Losing on time&quot; is possible at even the longer, traditional time controls, but is more common in blitz and rapid versions.

Play is governed by the FIDE Laws of Chess, except as modified by a specific tournament. However, in case of a dispute during a tournament, either player may stop the clock and call the arbiter to make a final and binding judgment.

Chess boxing uses a fast version for the chess component of the sport, granting 9 minutes for each side with no increment.

=== USCF rules for Quick and Blitz chess ===
The rules for fast chess differ between FIDE and the USCF.

With the USCF, a game with more than 10 minutes affects the Quick rating, and the upper bounds for this rating is capped at 65 minutes per player. As 30-minute to 65-minute-per-player time controls are also under the Regular rating system, these games affect both the Quick and Regular ratings and are known as &quot;dual-rated&quot; games. However, the K factor (a statistic used for ratings) is reduced by comparison, meaning that players will either lose or gain (or rarely both) fewer rating points compared to a solely Quick or Regular game. Any time control over 65 minutes counts under the Regular rating only. All of these time controls include the delay added to the time control, such as a 60-minute game with a 5-second delay, which is still considered to be a 60-minute game, not a 65-minute game.

As of March 2013, the USCF has also added a separate Blitz class rating for any time control between 5 and 10 minutes per player. It is not possible for a game to be dual rated as both Blitz and Quick. Unlike Quick chess, 5 minutes can also mean game 3+2 (three minutes with a two-second increment).

== World championships ==

Both official and unofficial FIDE-sponsored world championships for fast chess have been held since the 1970s.

=== World Rapid championships before 2012 ===
In 1987, Garry Kasparov (the World Champion of classical chess at the time) and Nigel Short played a 6-game exhibition Rapid match (&quot;Speed Chess Challenge&quot;) at the London Hippodrome, won by Kasparov 4–2.

The 1988 victory by Anatoly Karpov in Mazatlan was officially called the &quot;World Active Championship&quot;, but FIDE changed the word &#x27;active&#x27; to &#x27;rapid&#x27; soon after.

In 1992, FIDE held the Women&#x27;s World Rapid and Blitz Championship in Budapest, Hungary. Both Rapid and Blitz Championships were won by Susan Polgar.

The 2001 victory by Garry Kasparov in the FIDE World Cup of Rapid Chess (organized by the French Chess Federation in Cannes) was held contemporaneously to the Melody Amber rapids (thus splitting the top players between the two events), and it is sometimes considered to be official, although it was never named as a &quot;championship&quot; but rather a &quot;world cup&quot;.

Viswanathan Anand won the official FIDE 2003 Rapid Championship at the 6th Cap d&#x27;Agde event. After no bids in 2004, FIDE optioned the 2005 Rapid to Cap d&#x27;Agde, but it was not held. Teimour Radjabov won the 2006 &quot;7th Cap d’Agde Rapid Chess Tournament&quot;, but this had no FIDE status.

The yearly Frankfurt or Mainz events hosted by the &quot;Chess Tigers&quot; (2001–2010) were considered as the traditional rapid chess championship, and it often received world championship billing in the absence of an annual FIDE-recognized championship. In its last two years, the 2009 &quot;Grenkeleasing World Rapid Chess Championship&quot; in Mainz was won by Levon Aronian, and the 2010 &quot;Open GRENKE Rapid World Championship&quot; in Mainz was won by Gata Kamsky. The Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) also held a World Rapid Cup in some of these years, and the annual Amber chess tournament (1992 to 2011) also had a rapid segment. There was also occasionally a Eurotel Trophy or Intel Grand Prix event, each of which would be of high stature.

=== World Blitz championships before 2012 ===
The first unofficial &quot;Speed Chess Championship of the World&quot; (or World Blitz Championship) was held in Herceg Novi on 8 April 1970. This was shortly after the first USSR versus the rest of the world match (in Belgrade), in which ten of these players also competed. Eleven Grandmasters and one International Master played a double round-robin tournament. Bobby Fischer won first place, with a score of 19 points out of a possible 22. Fischer scored seventeen wins, four draws, and one loss (to Viktor Korchnoi). Mikhail Tal was a distant second, 4½ points behind. Fischer won both games against each of Tal, Tigran Petrosian, and Vasily Smyslov; all of them were past World Champions.

By 1971, the Russian and Moscow five-minute championships had been going several years, with Tal, Bronstein, and Petrosian all having success. That year, Fischer played in a blitz tournament organised by the Manhattan Chess Club, and scored 21½/22. There were also strong tournaments in Bugojno (in 1978), which was won by Karpov; and Nikšić (in 1983), which was won by Kasparov.

In 1987, the S.W.I.F.T. super-tournament was held in Brussels, Belgium; first prize was shared by Garry Kasparov and Ljubomir Ljubojević. The first FIDE-sponsored World Blitz Championship was won by Mikhail Tal in 1988.

In 1992, FIDE held the Women&#x27;s World Rapid and Blitz Championship in Budapest, Hungary. Both Rapid and Blitz Championships were won by Susan Polgar.

In 2000, Anand won the &quot;Plus GSM World Blitz Chess Cup,&quot; which has since been referred to as a world championship, albeit inconsistently.

The second FIDE-recognized World Blitz Championship was won by Alexander Grischuk in 2006 in Rishon Lezion, Israel; the third World Blitz Championship was won by Vassily Ivanchuk in 2007. The 4th World Blitz Championship was held in Almaty in 2008, and it was won by Leinier Dominguez Pérez of Cuba.

In 2009 and 2010, there was an event called the &quot;World Blitz Championship&quot;, held after the Tal Memorial in Moscow in November. It was won by Magnus Carlsen (in 2009) and Levon Aronian (in 2010), with the Women&#x27;s Championship being won by Kateryna Lagno (in 2010). There is no record of a 2009 blitz event in the FIDE Calendar for that year; however, the October 2009 FIDE Congress discussed whether it should be a &quot;proper&quot; Championship (given the qualification scheme), and it left the decision to the corresponding internal Commission. For 2010, it was organized in conjunction with FIDE from the beginning. However, in neither case was an arbiter&#x27;s report presented to the next FIDE Congress or General Assembly, as would be expected for a World Championship, and indeed occurred previously with the 2008 Blitz Championship. The 2012 Arbiter&#x27;s report refers to &quot;7th World Blitz Championship&quot; thus seeming to imply that 2009 and 2010 events were indeed Championships; although this report can be faulted for referring to the rapid championship of 2012 as being the &quot;1st World Rapid Championship&quot;, which at the very least forgets Anand&#x27;s official Rapid Championship in 2003. The balance of the evidence favors these Blitz Championships as being counted as official.

In 2011, there was no official blitz championship held, but FIDE was involved with the Sport Accord Mind Games blitz won by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, with Hou Yifan winning the women&#x27;s division.

=== World Championships since 2012 ===

Since 2012, FIDE have held joint World Rapid and Blitz Championships most years, with some years Women&#x27;s World Rapid and Blitz Championships also being held.

In 2012, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships were held at Batumi, Georgia and Astana, Kazakhstan (Women&#x27;s Championships) Sergey Karjakin won the Rapid Championship. Alexander Grischuk won the Blitz Championship. Antoaneta Stefanova won the Women&#x27;s Rapid Championship. Valentina Gunina won the Women&#x27;s Blitz Championship.

In 2013, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships were held at Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov won the Rapid Championship. Lê Quang Liêm won the Blitz Championship.

In 2014, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships were held at Dubai, UAE and Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia (Women&#x27;s Championships). Magnus Carlsen won both Rapid and Blitz Championships. Kateryna Lagno won the Women&#x27;s Rapid Championship. Anna Muzychuk won the Women&#x27;s Blitz Championship.

In 2015, the World Rapid and Blitz Championships were held in Berlin, Germany. Magnus Carlsen won the Rapid Championship. He also received the privilege of playing at a dedicated Board 1 the whole time, not having to move while others did. The given reason was that Norwegian television was sponsoring the event, and moving the heavy cameras around would be too much hassle. After his first-round draw, he should not have been on Board 1 until Round 8 when he caught the leaders. Carlsen himself later called this &quot;weird&quot; that Board 1 would be reserved for him. Alexander Grischuk won the Blitz Championship.

In 2015, FIDE did not receive the expected 80,000 euros from Agon&#x27;s organization of the event, causing a budget shortfall of 55,000 euros. It was later announced that approximately 200,000 euros were lost on the event.

In 2016, the World Rapid Championships were held at the Ali Bin Hamad Al Attiya Arena in Doha, Qatar. Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine won the 2016 World Rapid Championship, while Carlsen, after defending his title with difficulty in 2015, came in third place. In the Blitz Championship, Sergey Karjakin of Russia and contender in the recently held World Chess Championship 2016 won the championship title albeit due to a better tiebreak over the second place Carlsen. Karjakin defeated Carlsen in their individual encounter. Carlsen was once again reserved board 1 for both championships. Anna Muzychuk also from Ukraine, won both the 2016 Women World Rapid and Blitz Championshipship.

At the FIDE Presidential Board meeting at the end of March 2016, they gave Agon six months to find an organizer for the 2017 event. At the Baku General Assembly in September, it was announced they had extended this deadline until the end of 2016. The issue of the non-payment of the players for the IMSA Mind Games was also brought up.
=== Champions tables for official events ===






== Views on fast chess ==
Many top chess players disagree on the validity of fast chess compared to standard time controls as well as the usefulness of fast time controls for serious training.

Some quotes from top chess players may serve to illustrate this:

* &quot;I don&#x27;t know if bullet is useful but I think blitz is 100% useful. Blitz develops instincts.&quot; — Magnus Carlsen
* &quot;Any coach that&#x27;s trying to dissuade you from enjoying blitz is doing you a disservice.&quot; — Magnus Carlsen
* &quot;To be honest, I consider [bullet chess] a bit moronic, and therefore I never play it.&quot; — Vladimir Kramnik
* &quot;Blitz – it&#x27;s just a pleasure.&quot; — Vladimir Kramnik
* &quot;Blitz is simply a waste of time.&quot; — Vladimir Malakhov
* &quot;Blitz is the opposite [of classical chess], you don&#x27;t care at all. You can be drunk, you can dance all night, whatever happens you just need to be lucky and it will work.&quot; – Daniil Dubov
* &quot;I play way too much blitz chess. It rots the brain just as surely as alcohol.&quot; — Nigel Short

<text>The Ospreys (), formerly the Neath–Swansea Ospreys is one of the four professional rugby union teams from Wales. They compete in the United Rugby Championship and in European Professional Club Rugby competitions. The team formed as a result of Neath RFC and Swansea RFC combining to create a new merged entity, as part of the new regional structure of Welsh rugby, that began in 2003. They are also affiliated with a number of local semi-professional and amateur clubs, including Welsh Premier Division sides Aberavon RFC, Bridgend Ravens, and original founding clubs Neath and Swansea. The regional area represented by the team has widely become known for rugby purposes as &#x27;Ospreylia&#x27;.

Their main home ground is the Swansea.com Stadium, Swansea, although some smaller profile games have been played at the Brewery Field, Bridgend. Ospreys currently play in a black home strip, while the away strip is white. The Ospreys logo consists of an image of an Osprey mask.

The Ospreys are the most successful Welsh team in the history of the Celtic League or Pro12 tournament, having won the competition four times. They also became the first and only Welsh regional team to beat a major touring side, defeating 24–16 in 2006.

==History==
===Infancy===
On 24 July 2003, it was announced that the new team jointly representing Neath RFC and Swansea RFC would be known as the Neath–Swansea Ospreys. The Ospreys part of the team&#x27;s name was inspired by the use of the bird as Swansea RFC&#x27;s centenary badge. Former Neath RFC coach Lyn Jones was appointed as head coach, who named Scott Gibbs as the team&#x27;s first captain. 5 September 2003 saw the region play their first competitive game, a 41–30 Celtic League home win over Irish province Ulster at The Gnoll in Neath. Leeds Tykes were the Ospreys&#x27; first Heineken Cup opponents, with the English team triumphing 29–20 on 7 December 2003. They struggled to recover from their opening defeat, finishing bottom of their pool, recording their only victory against the Tykes&#x27; at home in the final round at St. Helens. Domestically the Ospreys&#x27; did salvage some pride, avoiding becoming the lowest placed Welsh region, by pipping Cardiff Blues to fifth place in the Celtic League.

Following the demise of the Celtic Warriors region on 1 June 2004, the Neath–Swansea Ospreys had their borders extended to cover much of the Bridgend and Ogmore areas to the east. However, for logistical reasons it was decided that no home games would be played at Bridgend RFC&#x27;s Brewery Field. Former Warriors players David Bishop, Brent Cockbain, Ryan Jones and Sonny Parker were signed by the Ospreys&#x27;.

===2004–2007===

The 2004–05 season saw significant on field improvement for the region. A capacity crowd of 10,280 was present at The Gnoll on 26 March 2005 to witness the Ospreys claim their first piece of silverware. A 29–12 win over Edinburgh, with two rounds of the competition still remaining, saw the team crowned Celtic League champions. However, impressive back to back wins over Harlequins were not enough to overcome Munster in the pool stages of that season&#x27;s Heineken Cup. On 14 May 2005 it was announced that the &quot;Neath–Swansea&quot; part of the team&#x27;s name would be dropped, with them to be referred to as the Ospreys.

A growing sense of expectation surrounded the team heading into 2005–06, an expectation they struggled to cope with, finishing a disappointing seventh in the Celtic League. A difficult Heineken Cup pool made up of tough opposition in Leicester Tigers, Stade Francais and ASM Clermont Auvergne proved too difficult, as they finished a distant third. A gutsy home victory over Stade and a last gasp defeat to Leicester, did however offer some crumbs of comfort. In April 2006 it was announced that noted former New Zealand All Blacks scrum half Justin Marshall had signed to play for Ospreys.

The Ospreys won the Celtic League during the 2006/07 season, topping the league by a single point and taking the title with an away win at Borders. Winning the Celtic League for a second time meant the Ospreys were the first team to have won the Celtic League twice. In February 2008, the Ospreys provided 13 of the starting line-up for Wales in their Six Nations match against England, setting a new record for the number of players from one region playing for their national side. During the 2007/08 season the Ospreys reached Quarter-final of the Heineken Cup for the first time but unexpectedly lost to Saracens. The following week they won the EDF Energy Cup beating Leicester Tigers at Twickenham.

In November 2006 when it became apparent that Wales &#x27;A&#x27; would not be able to face Australia A national rugby union team midweek during their November tour, the Ospreys became the first Welsh region to play a major international side since regional rugby was introduced, a match they won 24–16. Following the win over the Wallabies, the term Ospreylia became ingrained in popular culture with it being adopted by the region and its supporters as a description of the geographical area covered by the region, with supporters known as Ospreylians. Peter Black, Assembly Member for south west Wales has declared himself as AM for Ospreylia on his own blog.

On 23 February 2007, the Ospreys played their first &#x27;A&#x27; team match, against Newport-Gwent Dragons &#x27;A&#x27; at Bridgend, which was the first &#x27;A&#x27; match fixture for any of the Welsh regional sides. They lost the match 22–10. They have since gone on to play Worcester &#x27;A&#x27; in April, a game which they lost 24–23 to an injury-time penalty.

===2008–2011===
In February 2008 Andrew Hore was appointed as the Ospreys as elite performance director. Previously Hore had been high performance manager with the New Zealand Rugby Union.

A disappointing seventh-place finish in the Celtic League and a surprise Heineken Cup quarter-final exit to Saracens F.C. saw head coach Lyn Jones resign at the end of the 2007–08 season, on 16 May 2008 Assistant Coach Sean Holley and forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys would continue as part of a new management structure being overseen by Andrew Hore, until a replacement could be found. Scott Johnson, the former head coach of the Welsh national team, and attack coach when Wales won the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam in 2005 for the first time in 27 years, was announced as director of coaching at the Ospreys on 29 January 2009.

On 21 April 2009, the Ospreys had six players included in the British &amp; Irish Lions&#x27; squad for the 2009 South African tour: Lee Byrne (fullback), Tommy Bowe and Shane Williams (wings), Mike Phillips (scrum-half), Alun Wyn Jones (lock) and Adam Jones (prop). One notable omission however, was Wales and Ospreys captain Ryan Jones. The Ospreys announced the signing of former New Zealand All Blacks captain Jerry Collins on 9 May 2009. Collins had been a stalwart for the All Blacks, since 2004 but retired from international rugby in 2008.

A 29–28 defeat by Biarritz on 10 April 2010 dashed the team&#x27;s hopes of a first Heineken Cup semi-final appearance. A late Nicky Walker try in San Sebastien proved in vain. However, on 29 May 2010, the Ospreys won the 2009–10 Celtic League by defeating Leinster in the final by 17–12 at the RDS Arena in Dublin.

Following a wide-ranging review, Andrew Hore, previously elite performance director at the Ospreys, became on 26 April 2011 chief operations officer at the region.

2010–11 would not see the region reach the heights of the previous one. Despite winning all their home pool games in the Heineken Cup, a failure to win on the road proved costly, with Munster and Toulon progressing instead. Another win for Munster at Thomond Park on 14 May 2011, ended the Ospreys Celtic League aspirations at the semi-final stage.

===2012–2018===

Former player Steve Tandy was appointed as new Ospreys head coach on 15 February 2012 replacing Sean Holley in the role, as Scott Johnson also departed to take up a coaching role with Scotland. Both Holley and Johnson&#x27;s final game as part of the coaching setup at the Liberty Stadium had been a 36–5 away loss to Biarritz, which marked the end of a Heineken Cup campaign that saw them again fail to win on their travels. New coach Tandy enjoyed a successful start to his tenure, winning eight of his first ten matches as full-time Head Coach, including winning the 2011–12 Pro12 following a 31–30 win over Leinster at the RDS, thanks to a late Shane Williams try in his final match for the region 29–30 and Dan Biggar adding a difficult conversion for the win 31–30. Ospreys reached 2 semi-finals in the subsequent 6 seasons, but not made the final.

Following a poor start to the 2017–2018 season, Tandy was sacked by the Ospreys. Forwards coach Allen Clarke took over on an interim basis, before agreeing to a three-year deal as head coach.

=== 2018– ===
For the 2018–2019 season, along with new head coach Clarke, Matt Sherratt joined the coaching staff, replacing Gruff Rees. The season also began with notable squad changes, with record points scorer Dan Biggar departing for Northampton Saints, and stalwart Paul James retiring. The Ospreys were boosted with the signings of Welsh internationals George North, Scott Williams, and Aled Davies. The season saw a modest improvement for the Ospreys, winning 12 matches and losing 9, as well as beating west Wales rivals the Scarlets for a Champions Cup place. The Ospreys endured an inauspicious 2019–2020 season, finishing bottom of Conference A of the Pro14, winning just two of their 15 matches.

The 2020–2021 season saw Allen Clarke replaced by former electrician Toby Booth. He succeeded in sparking the region back to life, including an away win at eventual champions Leinster and a return to top tier European competition for the following season. In 2021–2022, the rebranded United Rugby Championship saw the Ospreys win the Welsh Shield, but struggle in the Champions Cup, losing all of their group games. A home win over Munster heralded the arrival of outstanding back row forward Jac Morgan.

The 2021–2022 season saw another mid-table finish in the United Rugby Championship, with the Ospreys narrowly missing out on a place in the play-offs, contested by the top eight teams, with a ninth-place finish. A worrying trend continued, as they again lost all four of their European Champions Cup fixtures. They secured a return to the top-level European competition by finishing top of the Welsh Shield.

The 2022–2023 season once again saw a mid-table finish in the United Rugby Championship. The Ospreys&#x27; European Champions Cup campaign started in ominous fashion, as a much-changed Leicester team defeated them at the Swansea.com stadium. As one of the lowest-seeded teams in the competition, the Ospreys would have to play the reigning English and French champions home and away in their group games. The defeat against Leicester was therefore followed by an away game in Montpellier. Against all expectations, and inspired by the arrival of master-tactician fly-half Owen Williams after the break-up of Worcester Warriors, the Ospreys beat Montpellier. That was followed by a win over Montpellier at home, and a titanic victory away at Leicester, which secured their place in the quarter finals. Results elsewhere meant that they missed out on home advantage in that quarter final, and were ultimately not able to get past Saracens, bowing out of the competition at the quarter final stage, but not without achieving some of the best results in Welsh regional rugby in years along the way.

In January 2024, the Ospreys management have stated they are looking at options for moving to a new ground. It will be a rugby home, suited to rugby supporters and not a shared football stadium like the Swansea.com.

==Home grounds==

In their first two seasons, the Ospreys shared their home games between St Helen&#x27;s (home ground of Swansea RFC) and The Gnoll (home ground of Neath RFC). Since their third season in 2005–06, they have played at the purpose-built 20,000 seat Liberty Stadium in Landore, Swansea, which is shared with Swansea City. The Liberty Stadium, with double the capacity of St Helen&#x27;s, has seen a capacity crowd for the matches against international tourists Australia &#x27;A&#x27; team (1 November 2006) and against local rivals the Scarlets. On 12 November 2010 the team played their first competitive fixture at the Brewery Field home ground of Bridgend Ravens in the Anglo-Welsh Cup.

In July 2024, it was announced that the Ospreys would be leaving the Swansea.com Stadium after 20 years for the 2025/26 season to play in the newly renovated, yet former host ground, the St Helen&#x27;s Rugby and Cricket Ground. The Swansea Cricket Club will be leaving the ground they have occupied since 1875.

==Kit suppliers==
From their foundation to the 2013–14 season, the Ospreys kit suppliers were Kooga. Between the seasons 2014–2017, BLK supplied the Ospreys kits. Canterbury supplied the kits for the 2018–2021 seasons. Starting for the 2021/22 season, the Ospreys would form a kit partnership with Umbro. This lasted until 2023 as in June of the same year, the Ospreys announced that they had signed a multi-year partnership with sportswear manufacturer Macron.

<text>Museology (also called museum studies or museum science) is the study of museums. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including curating, preservation, public programming, and education.

== Terminology ==
The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while &quot;museology&quot; is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (), Spanish (), German (), Italian (), and Portuguese () – while English speakers more often use the term &quot;museum studies&quot; to refer to that same field of study. When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the Greek &quot;&quot; (French: , Spanish: , German: , Italian: , Portuguese: ), while English speakers typically use the term &quot;museum practice&quot; or &quot;operational museology&quot;

== Development of the field ==
The development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early collectors and cabinets of curiosity in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during The Age of Enlightenment anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed natural history and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers’ colonization of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in Western European colonial projects.

In the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and &quot;civilize&quot; the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though World&#x27;s Fairs, such as The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London or the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry. In some cases world&#x27;s fairs became the basis for museums. For instance, The Field Museum in Chicago grew out of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

In the European context, the first academic journal on museology was the &quot;Zeitschrift für Museologie und Antiquitätenkunde sowie verwandte Wissenschaften&quot; (Journal for museology and antiquarianism as well as related sciences, 1878–1885) founded and edited by Dr (1814–1885), director of Dresden Porcelain Collection at the time. The journal was published twice a month from 1878 to 1885, and ended when the founding editor died. The &quot;Zeitschrift für Museologie&quot; was followed by the second German journal on museology, &quot;Museumskunde&quot; (since 1905), which was founded in Dresden by Dr (1868–1949), director of the Dresden History Museum at the time. Since 1917, the journal &quot;Museumskunde&quot; has become the official periodical of the Deutscher Museumsbund e.V. (German Museums Association, since 1917).

Museums Association, the first professional membership organization for those working in the museum field, was established in London in 1889. In 1901, they developed the &quot;Museums Journal&quot;, the first English periodical devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, which was followed by the American Association of Museum&#x27;s Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.

Beginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums. One attempt to re-envision museums’ role was the concept of ecomuseums, first proposed publicly at ICOM&#x27;s 9th International Conference in France (1971). Ecomuseums proliferated in Europe – and still exist around the world today – challenging traditional museums and dominant museum narratives, with an explicit focus on community control and the development of both heritage and sustainability. In 1988, Robert Lumley&#x27;s book The Museum Time Machine &quot;expressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operations&quot;. The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or &quot;old&quot; field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in Britain. Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies. Scholars who are engaged in various &quot;new&quot; museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend &quot;officially&quot; began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of &quot;radical reassessment of the roles of museums within society&quot;.

Critical theorists like Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, and Benedict Anderson also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed, often adding the term &quot;critical&quot; to their new titles (i.e. critical race theory), a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features, so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology

The latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being interdisciplinary, multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others are more traditional and therefore, less critical.

== Operational museology ==
Operational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including conservation and restoration), and its exhibitions and programs. While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis. Scholarship concerning operational museology has also overlapped with critical museology and other developments in the field.

=== Public role of museums ===
Operational museology has shifted in the late 20th and 21st century to position the museum as a central institution that serves the public by informing culture, history, and art while creating space for challenging conversations. Museums are thus perceived as cultural communicators that can reconstruct and reconnect cultural memory to the viewing public by collecting, preserving, documenting, and interpreting material culture. For example, many history museums engage with public memory from a multi-vocal perspective and present critical narratives regarding current sociopolitical issues. Other history museums, however, keep nationalistic approaches pertaining to the 19th century. Some museums convey reflexive and critical narratives, while others enact as &quot;mass mediums&quot; oriented toward international tourist networks. These institutions tend to display spectacular exhibition designs and grant little space for complex narratives and critical messages.

Scholars have identified a recent transformation in the way museums define their functions and produce their programming strategies as these have become spaces for encounters and meaningful experiences. For instance, in &quot;The Metamorphosis of the Museal: From Exhibitionary to Experiential Complex and Beyond&quot;, Andreas Huyssen observes the museum, formerly conceived as &quot;a container of the past and its accumulated objects&quot; is now conceived as &quot;a site of activity and experience in and for an ever-expanding present.&quot;

==Critical museology==

=== Overview of the field ===
Critical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology. It is a broad field of study that engages critically with museums, calling into question the foundational assumptions of the field. This demonstrates critical museology&#x27;s close connection to New Museology, which also challenges foundational assumptions in museology. Critical museology may also extend beyond the traditional museum to include cultural centres, heritage sites, memorials, art galleries, and so on.

=== Development of the field ===
Given that museums are historically linked to colonialism, imperialism, and European missionary work, they have a morally and politically problematic past. While some of the objects museums hold were purchased – though not always fairly and often to the exclusive benefit of the collector – a large proportion of museum collections were taken as spoils of war, or otherwise removed without the consent of the people or community that owned them. Museums, along with their collections – and collectors – played a key role in establishing and reiterating the dominance of colonial Europe and narratives of cultural superiority. Critical museology was developed through questioning the foundational assumptions of museum studies and museums, including their history, architecture, display, programming, and the provenance of their objects. Recent work has also analyzed exhibition design to show how the diverse media combined in exhibitions communicate and shape visitors&#x27; interpretations and values. While anthropologists and the field of anthropology were actively engaged in problematic collecting practices for two centuries, anthropologists have also been central to the emergence of critical museology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This has included reconstructing and analyzing those collection histories and the relationships that grew around them, as in the Pitt Rivers Museum&#x27;s &quot;Relational Museum&quot; project. They have also led interdisciplinary working groups that developed new approaches to globalizing processes in critical museology, as foregrounded in Museum Frictions, a third innovative volume co-edited by Ivan Karp. Additionally, anthropologists have spearheaded recent methodological and pedagogical developments in critical museology including &quot;curatorial dreaming&quot;, curating labs like the Making Culture Lab at Simon Fraser University, the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab at Concordia University, and the Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage (CARMAH) in Berlin, as well as courses like the International Field School in Critical Museology. In other contexts, historians have been at the forefront of interventions in critical museology.

=== Decolonizing and indigenizing museums ===
In North America, Australia, and New Zealand in particular, critical museology attempts to address the problematic colonial pasts of museums through the decolonization and Indigenization of museums.

Once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, decolonizing is now recognized – particularly in Canada – as a long-term process that involves dismantling the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological legacies of colonial power While there is no agreed upon end-goal of decolonization, the process of decolonizing the museum is aimed at &quot;assist[ing] communities in their efforts to address the legacies of historical unresolved grief by speaking the hard truths of colonialism and thereby creating spaces for healing and understanding&quot;.

Collaboration, consultation, and repatriation are key components of decolonizing museums. Australian museums have been leaders in developing repatriation processes, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities, beginning in the late 1980s. Projects involving collaboration and consultation with source communities have taken many forms, ranging from developing traveling exhibits, revising collection catalogues, to establishing community cultural centers and working with photographic collections together. In Canada, collaboration and consultation were first formally suggested by the 1994 Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, and are now seen by many museums as being an essential practice for any institution that holds collections belonging to Indigenous peoples. In North America, and around the world, some of the objects in those collections – particularly sacred objects or human remains – have been repatriated or returned to their communities of origin. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) formalized the process of repatriating Indigenous cultural objects in the United States. While Canada does not have a formal policy around repatriation, many museums have their own internal policies and many objects have been returned to Indigenous communities that way. Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success.

A newer concept, the Indigenization of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include Art Gallery of Ontario&#x27;s 2016 appointing of Wanda Nanibush as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art, Wood Land School&#x27;s takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal, the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the Musqueam Indian Band, the , the U’mista Cultural Centre, and the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally.

While there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67’; The Lubicon Cree&#x27;s boycott of The Spirit Sings, a Shell sponsored exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in 1988, and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994; and The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada&#x27;s 2015 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives.

=== Feminist critique and feminist curating ===
Given that museums and their collection strategies are historically linked to patriarchal values and marked by androcentric bias, critical feminist museology has developed as a distinct analytical approach. Scholars have identified that power relations of class, gender, and race are inscribed in the museum. Histories, theories, and practices of feminist curating have been explored in a series of conferences and symposia.

== New methodologies ==
===Vienna Method===
The Vienna Method, subsequently called ISOTYPES was developed by the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum (Museum for Social and Economic Affairs), Vienna. With the support of Otto Glöckel of the Vienna City Council the Museum sought to make sociological and economic information accessible to the whole population regardless of their level of education. 

=== Museum interventions ===
Interventions in museums were first employed by artists like Marcel Duchamp, who were looking to challenge both established elite art traditions and the expectations of museum visitors. By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups – including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves – as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.

==== Artist interventions ====
A central aspect of Institutional Critique, some artist&#x27;s interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves – like Fred Wilson&#x27;s Mining the Museum (1992) at the Maryland Historical Society, Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas’ Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC&#x27;s Museum of Anthropology, or the Artists&#x27; Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford – while others have been done without explicit permission, like Andrea Fraser&#x27;s Museum Highlights (1989) at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

One of the best known artist interventions in a museum is James Luna&#x27;s &quot;Artifact Piece&quot;, which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at &quot;The Decade Show&quot; in New York in 1990. Luna, a Luiseño artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna&#x27;s favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them. The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists – Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Coco Fusco – developed a traveling performance art piece called The &quot;Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West&quot; that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including Covent Gardens, the Walker Art Center, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History, the Australia Museum, and the Field Museum.

==== Activist interventions ====
While there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the Guerrilla Girls have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements – through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections – to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.

There is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the Corcoran Gallery of Art cancelled &quot;The Perfect Moment&quot;, an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe&#x27;s photos on the exterior of the museum. Similar protests occurred when David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s film &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; was removed from the &quot;Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture&quot; exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in 2010.

==== Internal institutional interventions ====

While most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 MoMA mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called &quot;Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 – Now&quot;. In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.

Another critical intervention in museums is the conception of permanent exhibitions, which are long-lasting galleries presenting the museum collections that critically reveal and approach the connections between the institution, its history and practices, and the cultural and social context in which the institution is embedded. This practice seeks to highlight the transformations in the paradigms that have determined the messages and languages of museums in the past, and invites visitors to reflect on the diverse roles of museums through history. The display of the collections of the Museum of Antioquia (Medellín, Colombia) exemplifies this practice. The design of the gallery &quot;Historias para re-pensar&quot; (Histories to re-think) focuses on the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, and proposes a critical review of the region&#x27;s art history thereby inquiring about the role of collectors and the Museum in the construction of aesthetic paradigms. The gallery includes contemporary works in order to install a dialogue between the past and the present. Additionally, the section of the permanent exhibition titled &quot;Galleries for decolonial dialogues: The persistence of the dogma&quot; displays an anachronistic array of works and documents in order to convey how enduring colonial dogmas determined the country&#x27;s cultural values and visual experiences during the 19th century. The project of redeveloping the Museum&#x27;s permanent galleries is part of a larger institutional transformation that makes the Museum of Antioquia a great example of comprehensive critical museology practices. Another example of this Museum&#x27;s critical approach is the artistic residency project of artist Nadia Granados who, with curator Carolina Chacón and a group of sex workers based in downtown Medellín, developed in 2017 the award-winning cabaret/performance &quot;Nadie sabe quién soy yo&quot; (No one knows who I am). From then on, the performers funded the group Las Guerreras del Centro, a collective to highlight the lives and stories of sex workers through artistic performances, knitting circles and other community actions.

&quot;Nadie sabe quién soy yo&quot; was the beginning of a series of curatorial and educational collaborations between Las Guerreras del Centro and the Museum of Antioquia. Such collaborative projects are destigmatizing and empowering critical museology practices that generate new spaces for exchanges and social dialogues. These spaces emerge from the museum, forge links beyond museum walls, and drastically transform the museum&#x27;s relationship with its social environment.

Another example of a museum presenting a critical review of messages conveyed by the institution in the past can be found in the Royal Ontario Museum permanent exhibition, specifically in its Canadian history galleries. In this case, ROM curators have repurposed old dioramas as a way to reflect critically on past uses of dioramas to portray indigenous people&#x27;s cultures. The new ironic diorama questions this common practice in museums and points out the stereotypes such practices promoted in the past (e.g., the depiction of indigenous peoples as belonging to another time or somehow as primitive or extinguished cultures).

=== Curatorial dreaming ===
Curatorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions. It is intended as &quot;an alternative mode of critical, intellectual practice – a form of ‘theorizing in the concrete’&quot;.

=== Curating workshops, courses and labs ===

Over the last three decades there has been a proliferation of curating workshops, courses, and labs that engage with New Museology and critical museology in museum spaces, in universities, and elsewhere. For instance, the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College in New York was founded in 1990 and began offering a graduate program in 1994. In Germany, the Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage is engaging with the social, cultural, and political issues facing contemporary museums. In Canada, two of the most innovative curating labs are the Making Culture Lab at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab at Concordia University in Montreal, which offered its inaugural International Field School in Critical Museology in May 2017. The African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies in Cape Town includes a curatorial module within a comprehensive diploma and M.A. program that engages critically with museum and heritage studies, the leading program on the continent.

<text>Avaldsnes Church (, formally &quot;St. Olav&#x27;s Church at Avaldsnes&quot;, ) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Karmøy Municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Avaldsnes on the northern part of the island of Karmøy. It is the church for the Avaldsnes parish which is part of the Karmøy prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The medieval stone church was built in a long church design by an unknown architect. The first church located here was likely built before the year 1024 on the site of Avaldsnes Kongsgård estate. The present stone church was built in 1250. The church seats about 400 people.

==History==
Before this church was constructed, there was a wooden church on the same site around the year 1024. That church is assumed to have been built by Olav Trygvason, and it is possible that the present stone church is built around this church originally. The church was mentioned by the historian Snorri Sturluson in chapter 19 of his book &quot;Soga om Olav den heilage&quot;.

This church has been a landmark for seafarers passing through the Karmsundet strait for 750 years. King Håkon IV Håkonsson gave permission to replace the old wooden church with a stone church around the year 1250. The new stone building was not completed until nearly 1320, and was then the fourth largest in the country. The church was dedicated to St. Olav and received the status of &quot;Royal Chapel&quot;. During the same period it became one of four &quot;college-churches&quot; (it appointed a council of theological and juridical scholars). Probably there was a group of four scholars and teachers in law and theology. The stone church had a rectangular nave and narrower, rectangular chancel as well as a large tower to the west.

There was an octagonal stone room located to the south of the quire. This octagonal room was a chapter house (&quot;kapittelhus&quot;). These rooms were common for English cathedrals and they were used for large group meetings. This room is assumed to have been referenced in 1599 by clergyman and historical writer Peder Claussøn Friis (1545–1614). Remaining walls for this room were visible as late as 1840, but are now completely gone.

Decay started with the Black Death in 1349–1351. This disaster was followed by 400 years of Danish supremacy. In this period, the church gradually fell into a state of ruin due to lack of repair. By 1599, the quire was the only room left in the old church that was still usable. During the 17th century, a little wooden church was built inside the stone walls and this was used for more than 200 years.

In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.

The first restoration work began in 1830. The old steeple was demolished, the nave was rebuilt, and a small wooden steeple was erected on the top. In the 1920s the church was once again restored in a manner which was more similar to its original architecture. A new stone steeple was built and the interior renewed.

The German occupation in World War II became dramatic for the church. German officials asserted that the high steeple was used as a landmark for Allied planes, coming in over the strait of Karmsund to drop bombs in the water. German authorities demanded the steeple be demolished. Many people were engaged in the task of saving it, and they persuaded the German military to let them camouflage the whole church with timber. This was to be done in 5 weeks, but the whole job lasted a year. The front of the church bears a couple of bullet holes.

The stained glass windows were ordered for the 700th anniversary in 1950. They were the creation of by Norwegian artist Bernhard Greve (1886-1962) from Lofthus who worked mainly with stained glass, fresco, and ceramic sculpture. The windows portrayed important events in the life of Christ: baptism, passion, ascension, and resurrection.

The altar, baptismal font, and pulpit were designed in the 1920s by Norwegian functionalist architect Eivind Moestue (1893-1977). The baptismal basin dates back to the 16th century.

==Design and architecture==
The pointed arches, but thick walls and no pillars, suggest an early Gothic design. The walls are composed of ordinary gray stone in thickness about . The corners and frames around the doors and windows are of steatite (soapstone) from Tolgetjønn near Haugesund.

==Mary&#x27;s Needle==
Mary&#x27;s Needle () is the only one remaining of several monumental stones which once stood around the church area. The stone has been somewhat taller, but, towering at it is still the second largest of its kind in Norway. The stone leans in towards the church wall—the distance to the wall is in fact only .

<doc id="844811" wikidata="Q221706" url="?curid=844811" title="Ceiling">
<text>A ceiling is an overhead interior roof that covers the upper limits of a room. It is not generally considered a structural element, but a finished surface concealing the underside of the roof structure or the floor of a story above. Ceilings can be decorated to taste, and there are many examples of frescoes and artwork on ceilings, especially within religious buildings. A ceiling can also be the upper limit of a tunnel.

The most common type of ceiling is the dropped ceiling, which is suspended from structural elements above. Panels of drywall are fastened either directly to the ceiling joists or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Alternatively, ceilings may be spray painted instead, leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted, and using spray foam. 

A subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling, wherein a network of aluminum struts, as opposed to drywall, are attached to the joists, forming a series of rectangular spaces. Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard, interspersed with aluminum rails, is seen as the ceiling from below. This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling, since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard, rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it.

Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings.

==Types==

Ceilings are classified according to their appearance or construction. A cathedral ceiling is any tall ceiling area similar to those in a church. A dropped ceiling is one in which the finished surface is constructed anywhere from a few inches or centimeters to several feet or a few meters below the structure above it. This may be done for aesthetic purposes, such as achieving a desirable ceiling height; or practical purposes such as acoustic damping or providing a space for HVAC or piping. An inverse of this would be a raised floor. A or barrel-shaped ceiling is curved or rounded upward, usually for visual or acoustical value, while a coffered ceiling is divided into a grid of recessed square or octagonal panels, also called a &quot;lacunar ceiling&quot;. A cove ceiling uses a curved plaster transition between wall and ceiling; it is named for cove molding, a molding with a concave curve. A stretched ceiling (or stretch ceiling) uses a number of individual panels using material such as PVC fixed to a perimeter rail.

==Elements==

Ceilings have frequently been decorated with fresco painting, mosaic tiles and other surface treatments. While hard to execute (at least in place) a decorated ceiling has the advantage that it is largely protected from damage by fingers and dust. In the past, however, this was more than compensated for by the damage from smoke from candles or a fireplace. Many historic buildings have celebrated ceilings. Perhaps the most famous is the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo.

Ceiling height, particularly in the case of low ceilings, may have psychological impacts. 

==Fire-resistance rated ceilings==
The most common ceiling that contributes to fire-resistance ratings in commercial and residential construction is the dropped ceiling. In the case of a dropped ceiling, the rating is achieved by the entire system, which is both the structure above, from which the ceilings is suspended, which could be a concrete floor or a timber floor, as well as the suspension mechanism and, finally the lowest membrane or dropped ceiling. Between the structure that the dropped ceiling is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of drywall, there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run.

An independent ceiling, however, can be constructed such that it has a stand-alone fire-resistance rating. Such systems must be tested without the benefit of being suspended from a slab above in order to prove that the resulting system is capable of holding itself up. This type of ceiling would be installed to protect items above from fire.

<doc id="844813" wikidata="Q2352473" url="?curid=844813" title="M-14 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-14 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the southeastern portion of the US state of Michigan. Entirely freeway, it runs for to connect Ann Arbor with Detroit by way of a connection with Interstate 96 (I-96). The western terminus is at a partial interchange with I-94 west of Ann Arbor. From there, the freeway curves around the north side of Ann Arbor and runs concurrently with US Highway 23 (US 23). East of that section, M-14 passes through woodlands and fields in Washtenaw County. In Wayne County, the freeway returns to a suburban area of mixed residential neighborhoods and light industrial areas. It crosses two different rivers and a pair of rail lines as it approaches Detroit&#x27;s inner suburbs, where it terminates at an interchange between I-96 and I-275.

When the state&#x27;s highway system was first signed in 1919, there was a different M-14 that ran the length of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This was later replaced by a pair of different US Highways in the 1920s and 1930s. Another M-14 was designated that lasted until the 1940s. The current highway dates back to 1956 when it was designated along a series of roads that previously carried US 12. During the 1960s and 1970s, M-14 was moved to the freeway alignment it currently uses; sections of the former route are still maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as unsigned highways.

==Route description==
The western terminus of M-14 is west of Ann Arbor, at exit 171 on I-94. This is a partial interchange; only traffic from eastbound I-94 can access eastbound M-14, and traffic from westbound M-14 must follow westbound I-94. From this junction, M-14 runs northeasterly through suburban Scio Township. The freeway is bordered by residential subdivisions to the southeast and woodlands to the northwest. M-14 curves around to the east through an interchange that has ramps that connect Miller and Maple roads; the ramps connect to Maple Road through a pair of roundabouts. As it approaches the Huron River, the freeway has an interchange with Business US 23 (Bus. US 23); the two highways merge and run concurrently to the north over the river. Bus. US 23/M-14 then has an unusual right-in/right-out interchange that uses short connector roads to provide access to Barton Drive on the north side of the river. The freeway then continues north to an interchange with US 23. The business loop ends there, and M-14 turns eastward to follow the US 23 freeway around the north side of Ann Arbor.

The US 23/M-14 freeway runs for about before US 23 turns southward to run between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti while M-14 continues east through Ann Arbor Township past Domino&#x27;s Farms, the office complex for Domino&#x27;s Pizza that was to be the home to Tom Monaghan&#x27;s Leaning Tower of Pizza. East of that complex, M-14 runs through woodlands and fields north of the community of Dixboro. The freeway turns northeasterly after the interchange with M-153. At the Napier Road underpass, M-14 crosses into Wayne County.

Once across the county line, the M-14 freeway runs through residential subdivisions from the western Detroit suburbs. There is an interchange for Beck Road and M-14 expands to six lanes, turning back to the east. The freeway crosses a rail line operated by CSX Transportation, and passes the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Sheldon Road Plant near the Sheldon Road interchange. There is a crossing for another CSX rail line near the bridges over the River Rouge by the St. Johns Golf Course. The freeway through this area curves around a bit north of its previous course. As M-14 nears the Livonia city line, it meets an interchange with I-96 and I-275 that marks the eastern terminus of M-14 in Plymouth Township.

M-14 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-14 were the 86,500 vehicles daily east of the Sheldon Road interchange in Plymouth Township; the lowest counts were the 26,641 vehicles per day west of the Miller Road interchange. All of M-14 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Previous designations===
In July 1919, M-14 was signed on a north–south route that ran most of the length of the Lower Peninsula, beginning at the Ohio state line south of Hudson to end south of downtown Cheboygan. It mostly followed the path of present-day US 127, I-75 and M-27. This edition of M-14 was truncated in November 1926 when the US Highway System was formed. From the Jackson area north to Lansing, it was US 127; from Lansing to Cheboygan, it was US 27. In 1930, US 127 was rerouted to replace the remainder of M-14 when US 223 was created. Right afterwards, M-14 was designated from Battle Creek to Edmore. This designation of M-14 was eliminated when M-66 was rerouted to replace it in the mid-1940s.

===Current designation===
In 1956, the portion of US 12 from the west side of Ann Arbor into Detroit was rerouted from surface streets to new stretches of freeways running south of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. The former route of US 12, much of which was known as Plymouth Road, was retained as a trunkline and redesignated M-14. In 1964, a northern bypass connecting US 23 with M-153 was completed, and M-14 was rerouted onto the new freeway; the highway still ran through Ann Arbor along routes now designated Bus. US 23 and Business Loop I-94. The following year, the freeway was extended to its present western terminus at I-94, and M-14 is removed from the business routes and transferred to the expressway.

In 1977, when the Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was shortened to have its eastern terminus at I-275 exit 28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road–Ann Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an unsigned trunkline, maintained by the state to this day. In 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth–Ann Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor Road from the Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an unsigned state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT.

In 2003, JDP launched the &quot;Jharkhand Front&quot; together with four other parties, namely Jharkhand People&#x27;s Party, Jharkhand Party (Naren), Jharkhand Party (Horo) and Jharkhand Vikas Dal.

In the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, the JDP launched four candidates from West Bengal, two from Bihar and one from Jharkhand.

Jharkhand Disom Party supports Raj Thackeray&#x27;s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena&#x27;s agitations against North Indians in Maharashtra.

In August 2014, Salkhan Murmu merged his Jharkhand Disom Party into the BJP in presence of former Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda.

<text>Sparkenhoe was a hundred of Leicestershire, England in the south-west of the county, covering Market Bosworth and Hinckley, broadly corresponding to the modern districts of Blaby and Hinckley and Bosworth.
The meeting place of the Sparkenhoe Hundred was probably at Shericles Farm near Desford (SK467026), which derives from scirac meaning &quot;the hundred oak&quot;.
Sparkenhoe hundred was not recorded in the Domesday Book as a wapentake, being formed in 1346 from part of Guthlaxton and Goscote.

<doc id="844832" wikidata="Q1615445" url="?curid=844832" title="Counts and dukes of Guise">
<text>Count of Guise and Duke of Guise ( , ) were titles in the French nobility.

Originally a seigneurie, in 1417 Guise was erected into a county for René, a younger son of Louis II of Anjou.

While disputed by the House of Luxembourg (1425–1444), the county was ultimately retained by the House of Anjou and its descendants, passing in 1520 to the cadet branch of the ducal House of Lorraine that became known as the House of Guise, headed by Claude of Lorraine. In 1528, the county was elevated to a dukedom and peerage of France for him. The Dukes of Guise and their sons played a prominent role in the French Wars of Religion, during which they were the leaders of the ultra-Catholic faction.

This dukedom became extinct in 1688, and the lands attached to it passed to the Princess Palatine Anne, a great-granddaughter of Charles of Lorraine-Guise, Duke of Mayenne – although she was not the heiress in strict primogeniture, that being the Duke of Mantua. The dukedom was recreated for Anne and her husband, Henri Jules de Bourbon, Prince of Condé in 1704.

On the extinction of the Bourbon-Condé family in 1830, the Guise dukedom was inherited by the House of Orléans, descendants of Anne&#x27;s granddaughter Louise Henriette de Bourbon, Duchess of Orleans. Louis Philippe of Orléans having become King of the French in 1830, henceforth the title &quot;Duke of Guise&quot; was used as a courtesy title for members of this family after it was deposed and went into exile in 1848, firstly for three sons of Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale, and then for Prince Jean, son of Robert d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Chartres. In 1926, Jean, Duke of Guise became the Orléanist claimant to the throne of France as &quot;Jean III&quot;.

*John, Count of Ligny (John I) (1425–1441)
*Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol (Louis I) (1441–1444)

===House of Anjou===

The marriage of Charles of Le Maine, younger brother of René, to Isabelle of Luxembourg, sister of Louis, allowed him to peacefully recover Guise.

*Charles of Le Maine (Charles I) (1444–1472)
*Charles IV, Duke of Anjou (Charles II) (1472–1481)

===House of Armagnac – House of Rohan===

*Louis d&#x27;Armagnac, Duke of Nemours (Louis II) (1491–1503)

In 1520, the Parlement of Paris awarded the countship of Guise to Claude of Lorraine, second son of René II of Lorraine (the grandson of René I of Naples) and heir to his French possessions. The countship was elevated to a dukedom in 1528.

*Claude de Lorraine (Claude) (1520–1528)

==Dukes of Guise (1528–1688 and 1704–1830)==
===House of Guise===
*Claude, Duke of Guise (1496–1550; s.1528) (Claude) (Father of Mary of Guise mother of Mary, Queen of Scots)
*Francis (1519–1563; s. 1550), son of the above;
*Henry I (1550–1588; s. 1563), son of the above;
*Charles (1571–1640; s. 1588), son of the above;
*Henry II (1614–1664; s. 1640), son of the above;
*Louis Joseph (1650–1671; s. 1664), nephew of the above;
*Francis Joseph (1670–1675 s. 1671), son of the above;
*Marie (1615–1688; s.1675), sister of Henry II.
Marie did not marry and had no descendants. She bequeathed Guise to a kinsman, Charles François de Stainville on 8 January 1688. This was undone by the Parlement of Paris at the request of other claimants to the estate, among whom was the wife of France&#x27;s &quot;premier prince du sang&quot; Anne Henriette of Bavaria, Princess of Condé, a great-granddaughter of Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne through her mother. In this way the lands of the House of Guise—and later the ducal title—came to the House of Bourbon-Condé.

===House of Bourbon-Condé===
* Anne Henriette of Bavaria (1648–1723), 3rd cousin of Louis Joseph;
* Henry III (1643–1709), husband of the above;
* Louis II (Louis II) (1668–1710), son of the above;
* Louis III Henry (1692–1740), son of the above;
* Louis IV Joseph (1736–1818), son of the above;
* Louis V Henry (1756–1830), son of the above.

Afterwards, the title was extinguished and no longer bestowed. It returned to the royal domain. Louis Henri though left his estate to his godson, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Aumale. He was bestowed with the personal title of Duke of Guise by Louis-Philippe, King of the French, his grandfather, in 1847.

===House of Bourbon-Orléans===

From here on the title became a courtesy title used by the House of Orléans.

*Henri d&#x27;Orléans (1847–1847) son of Henri d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Aumale
*François Paul d&#x27;Orléans (1852–1852) brother of Henri
*François Louis d&#x27;Orléans (1854–1872) brother of Henri and François Paul
*Jean d&#x27;Orléans (1874–1940) grandson of Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans

<text>Guthlaxton is an ancient hundred of Leicestershire. Its jurisdiction was in the south of the county, and covered Lutterworth and Wigston Magna. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, it was one of Leicestershire&#x27;s four wapentakes, and covered a much larger area, including Market Bosworth and Hinckley, which would later be made part of the Sparkenhoe hundred.

The original meeting place of the hundred was at the Guthlaxton stone. The Sparkenhoe hundred was split from Guthlaxton in 1346.

Guthlaxton College in Wigston Magna was named after the hundred. The school was renamed Wigston College in 2015.

In the late 19th century the administrative aspects of most hundreds were given to other specialized governmental divisions.

<text>The Adobe Range is a minor mountain range of Nevada. Located northwest and north of Elko, Nevada, it runs generally north-south for about , and has an area of about . Its highest point is an unnamed summit of and the named peaks include Sherman Peak (), Twin Peaks (East and West, and respectively) and The Buttes ().

The vegetation of the range is primarily sagebrush steppe. Various intermittent creeks feed the Humboldt River, which borders the range to the south and east.

Ownership is split roughly equally between private ownership and the Bureau of Land Management. Suburbs of Elko back up to the southern part of the Adobes, where the ski area Elko Snobowl is located. Several coal mines are to be found in the northern part of the range.

The Adobe Range is a newly developed climbing area, with routes on conglomerate rock ranging from YDS 5.6 to 5.10.

<text>Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) belong to the lipoprotein particle family and are formed from the degradation of very low-density lipoproteins as well as high-density lipoproteins. IDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL) that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream. Each native IDL particle consists of protein that encircles various lipids, enabling, as a water-soluble particle, these lipids to travel in the aqueous blood environment as part of the fat transport system within the body. Their size is, in general, 25 to 35 nm in diameter, and they contain primarily a range of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. They are cleared from the plasma into the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis, or further degraded by hepatic lipase to form LDL particles.

Although one might intuitively assume that &quot;intermediate-density&quot; refers to a density between that of high-density and low-density lipoproteins, it in fact refers to a density between that of low-density and very-low-density lipoproteins.
In general, IDL, somewhat similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), transports a variety of triglyceride fats and cholesterol and, like LDL, can also promote the growth of atheroma.

VLDL is a large, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein secreted by the liver that transports triglyceride to adipose tissue and muscle. The triglycerides in VLDL are removed in capillaries by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, and the VLDL returns to the circulation as a smaller particle with a new name, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). The IDL particles have lost most of their triglyceride, but they retain cholesteryl esters. Some of the IDL particles are rapidly taken up by the liver; others remain in circulation, where they undergo further triglyceride hydrolysis by hepatic lipase and are converted to LDL. A distinguishing feature of the IDL particle is their content of multiple copies of the receptor ligand ApoE in addition to a single copy of ApoB-100. The multiple copies of ApoE allow IDL to bind to the LDL receptor with a very high affinity. When IDL is converted to LDL, the ApoE leaves the particle and only the ApoB-100 remains. Thereafter, the affinity for the LDL receptor is much reduced.

<text>Gartree was a hundred of Leicestershire.

It was in the south-east of the county, roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Harborough district. The town of Market Harborough was its largest settlement. It gives its name to HMP Gartree, and also to the Gartree electoral division of Leicestershire.

The original meeting place of the hundred, which was used for local administration, justice and taxation, was the Gartree Bush, or Gartree (possibly from the Scandinavian word &quot;geir&quot; or spear), lying north east of Kibworth and south west of Gaulby on the Roman Via Devana, now known as the Gartree Road. This was the open-air meeting place from the tenth century to the eighteenth century where jurors, drawn from the local villages, handed out justice and administered taxes each month. It may have been the site of a prehistoric burial mound, and the site of a previous Anglo Saxon moot place. In 1750, this was moved to the Bull&#x27;s Head at Tur Langton.

<text>Manado (, ) is the capital city of the Indonesian province of North Sulawesi. It is the second largest city in Sulawesi after Makassar, with the 2020 census giving a population of 451,916, and the official estimates for mid 2023 showing 458,582 inhabitants (229,982 males and 228,600 females), distributed over a land area of 157.26 km2. The Manado metropolitan area had a population of 1,377,815 as of mid 2023. The city is situated on the Bay of Manado, and is surrounded by a mountainous area.

Manado is among Indonesia&#x27;s top-five tourism priorities and Bunaken National Park is one of the city&#x27;s most famous tourist attractions. Tunan Waterfall in Talawaan village and Mount Tumpa are some of the many attractions for visitors who like to take Manado city tour especially to natural places. The city is served by Sam Ratulangi International Airport, which connects Manado with various domestic destinations, as well as international destinations in East Asia and Southeast Asia. The city is also known for its Christian-majority population, and holds the country&#x27;s biggest Christmas celebration annually. It is also recognised as one of the most tolerant and peaceful cities in Indonesia.

==Etymology==
The name Manado is derived from the Sangir language word &quot;manaro&quot;, meaning &#x27;on the far coast&#x27; or &#x27;in the distance&#x27;, and originally referred to the further of two islands which can be seen from the mainland. When the settlement on this island was relocated to the mainland, the name Manado was brought with it, after which the island itself became referred to as Manado Tua (Old Manado). The name for Manado in the Sangir language is &quot;Manaro&quot;, while in Gorontalo is &quot;Moladu&quot;.

==History==
The first mention of Manado comes from a world map by French cartographer Nicolas Desliens, which shows the island of Manarow (today&#x27;s Manado Tua). Before Europeans arrived in North Sulawesi, the area was under the rule of the Sultan of Ternate, who exacted tribute and introduced Islam to its inhabitants. The Portuguese made the Sultan their vassal, ruling over the Minahasa people, and establishing a factory in Wenang.

Meanwhile, the Spanish had already set themselves up in the Philippines and Minahasa was used to plant coffee because of its rich soil. Manado was further developed by Spain as a centre of commerce for the Chinese traders who traded the coffee in China. With the help of native allies, the Spanish took over the Portuguese fortress in Amurang in the 1550s, and Spanish settlers also established a fort at Manado, so that eventually, Spain controlled all of the Minahasa. It was in Manado where one of the first Indo-Eurasian (Mestizo) communities in the archipelago developed during the 16th century. The first King of Manado (1630) named Muntu Untu was in fact the son of a Spanish Mestizo.
Spain renounced its possessions in Minahasa by means of a treaty with the Portuguese in return for a payment of 350,000 ducats. Minahasan natives made an alliance treaty with the Dutch, and expelled the last of the Portuguese from Manado a few years later.

The Dutch East India Company or Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie (VOC) built a fortress in Manado named Fort Amsterdam in 1658. As with regions in eastern Indonesia, Manado has undergone Christianisation by Dutch missionaries, including Riedel and John Gottlieb Schwarz. The Dutch missionaries built the first Christian church in Manado called Oude Kerk (Old church), which still stands, and is now called Gereja Sentrum. HMS &quot;Dover&quot; captured Manado in June 1810. The Javanese prince Diponegoro was exiled to Manado by the Dutch government in 1830 for leading a war of rebellion against the Dutch. In 1859, the English biologist Alfred Wallace visited Manado and praised the town for its beauty.
In 1919, the Apostolic Prefecture of Celebes was established in the city. In 1961, it was promoted to the Diocese of Manado.

The Japanese captured Manado in the Battle of Manado in January 1942. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II.

In 1958, the headquarters of the rebel movement Permesta was moved to Manado. When Permesta confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform, Jakarta responded by bombing the city in February 1958, and then invading in June 1958.

In 1962, the People&#x27;s Representative Council declared Manado as the official capital city of North Sulawesi Province.

==Climate==

The hottest month is August with an average temperature of , while the coolest months are January and February with an average temperature of . Winter (Dec-Feb) can be considered wetter, rainier and cooler than summer (Jun-Aug). Unlike other cities in Indonesia, the temperature seems to be cooler.

==Administrative districts==

These are all tabulated below with their areas and populations at the 2010 census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2022. The table also includes the location of the district administrative centres, the number of urban villages (all rated as &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district, and its post codes.

==Demographics==
===Ethnicity and languages===
Currently, the majority of Manado city residents are from the Minahasa ethnic group. The indigenous people of Manado are from the Tombulu people. The Tombulu language is considered one of the Minahasa languages and is spoken widely in several urban villages within Manado, for example: Wenang (Wenang / Mahawenang - kolintang), Tumumpa (down), Mahakeret (yelling), Tikala Ares (Walak Ares Tombulu, where the word &#x27;ares&#x27; means punishable), Ranotana (ground water), Winangun (built), Wawonasa (wawoinasa - sharpened above), Pinaesaan (unity place), Pakowa (Tree of Treasure), Teling (fur / bamboo to make equipment), Titiwungen (excavated), Tuminting (from the word Ting-Ting: a bell, the inserted syllable -um- changing the noun to a verb, so Tuminting: ringing bell), Pondol (Edge), Wanea (from the word Wanua: meaning the country), etc. While the Malalayang area has residents mainly from the Bantik people, other indigenous groups in Manado today are from the Sangir, Gorontalo, Mongondow, Babontehu, Talaud, Tionudese, Siau, and Borgo peoples.

<doc id="844866" wikidata="Q1068112" url="?curid=844866" title="Manado Malay">
<text>Manado Malay, or simply the Manado language, is a creole language spoken in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi province in Indonesia, and the surrounding area. The local name of the language is , and the name Minahasa Malay is also used, after the main ethnic group speaking the language. Since Manado Malay is used primarily for spoken communication, there is no standard orthography.

Manado Malay differs from standard Malay in having numerous Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and Ternate loan words, as well as having traits such as its use of as a first person singular pronoun, rather than as a first person inclusive plural pronoun. It is derived from North Moluccan Malay (Ternate Malay), which can be evidenced by the number of Ternate loanwords in its lexicon. For example, the pronouns (&#x27;you&#x27;, singular) and (&#x27;you&#x27;, plural) are of Ternate–Tidore origin. Manado Malay has been displacing the indigenous languages of the area.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
The vowel system of Manado Malay consists of five vowel phonemes.

===Consonants===
Manado Malay has nineteen consonants and two semivowels.

===Stress===
Most words in Manado Malay have stress on the pre-final syllable:
However, there are also many words with final stress:
==Grammar==

===Pronouns===
====Personal====
====Possessives====
Possessives are built by adding to the personal pronoun or name or noun, then followed by the &#x27;possessed&#x27; noun. Thus has the function similar to English &quot;&#x27;s&quot; as in &quot;the doctor&#x27;s uniform&quot;.

===Interrogative words===
The following are the interrogative words or &quot;w-words&quot; in Manado Malay:

===Grammatical aspect===
 (&#x27;to be&#x27;) can be used in Manado Malay to indicate the perfective aspect, e.g.:
* = &#x27;They already went down to Wenang&#x27;
* = &#x27;We ate already&#x27; or &#x27;We have eaten already&#x27;

===Nasal final===
The final nasals and in Indonesian are replaced by the &quot;-ng&quot; group in Manado Malay, similar with Terengganu dialect of Malaysia (as well as other languages in Sulawesi such as Buginese and Makassarese), e.g.:
* (Indonesian ) = &#x27;to eat&#x27;,
* (Indonesian ) = &#x27;to walk&#x27;,
* (Indonesian ) = &#x27;to shower&#x27;, etc.

===Prefix===
====&quot;ba-&quot; prefix====
The ber- prefix in Indonesian, which serves a function similar to the English -ing, is modified into ba- in Manado Malay. E.g.: (, &#x27;walking&#x27;), (, &#x27;swimming&#x27;), (, &#x27;laying eggs&#x27;)

====&quot;ma(°)-&quot; prefix====
° = ng, n, or m depending on phonological context.

The me(°)- prefix in standard Indonesian, which also serves a function to make a verb active, is modified into ma(°)- in Manado Malay. E.g.: (, &#x27;hooking fish&#x27;), (, &#x27;dancing&#x27;), (, &#x27;searching&#x27;), (, &#x27;cooking&#x27;), (, &#x27;crying&#x27;).

==Influences==
===Loanwords===
Due to the historical presence of the Dutch and the Portuguese in eastern Indonesia, several Manado Malay words originate from their languages. However, there is little influence from the local Minahasan languages, and borrowings from Spanish are not very prominent either – in spite of the historical Spanish dominance – suggesting that Manado Malay was transplanted from outside the Minahasa region. On the other hand, Portuguese influence is comparatively significant, considering that the Portuguese presence in the area was relatively limited. There is also some influence of loanwords from another Austronesian language group called Gorontalo–Mongondow languages. There is also a layer of loanwords from the non-Austronesian language of Ternate, which was controlled by the Portuguese in the period 1512–1655.

===Indonesian loanwords from Manado Malay===
Several words in Manado Malay are loaned to standard Indonesian:
* (which indicates reciprocality) e.g.: (&#x27;to punch each other&#x27;), (&#x27;to hit each other&#x27;), Originally a loanword from Ternate, it has spread through Manado Malay into other regions of Indonesia.

==Examples==
Examples :
* = I
* = you
* = we
* = they
* = yes
* = no (&#x27; = glottal stop)

Sentences :
* : My mother went to the market
* : You haven&#x27;t eaten since yesterday.
* : Don&#x27;t lie to me!
* : We can surely it.

<text>In philately, a mint stamp is one which is unused, has never been mounted and has the original gum, (if issued with gum). The term applies equally to postage stamps and revenue stamps.

In practice, the term is used within philately to refer to any stamp that appears to be unused with gum. It also includes those without gum but only when they have been issued without gum.

To avoid confusion the various states of mint can be distinguished in the abbreviations stated under &quot;Variations&quot;.

== Variations ==
Variations of the term &quot;mint&quot; include:
*Mint hinged (MH) – the stamp is unused but has been previously hinged. Remains of the hinge or gum disturbance are visible.
*Mounted mint (MM) – the same as Mint hinged.
*Mint no gum (MNG) – the stamp is as has been issued without gum.
*Unmounted mint (UM) – the stamp is unused and appears never to have been mounted.
*Mint never hinged (MNH) – the same as unmounted mint but with an assertion that the stamp is not a formerly mounted stamp that has been tampered with to remove traces of mounting.
The hinging referred to in these terms is mounting of the stamp in a stamp album by the application of a stamp hinge to the back of the stamp. The highest grade is &quot;unmounted mint&quot; or &quot;mint never hinged&quot;. The term &quot;mint never hinged&quot; has developed to provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term &quot;unmounted mint&quot; was thought to be ambiguous.

In practice only the terms MNH and MH are used, but in some cases the term MNG when there are no, or hardly any stamps are known with gum.

== Value ==
Mint stamps are often more valuable than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive. A mint stamp may also be in better condition than a used stamp which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.

== Tampering ==
Differences between mint and used values for the same stamp have led to a small industry in removing, or adding, postal cancellations to stamps. Another common practice is to attempt to remove fiscal cancellations, which are often pen cancels, in order to change a stamp used fiscally (for tax purposes) to one apparently unused. Stamps available for both postage and revenue (fiscal) purposes are usually worth more unused or with a postal cancellation. Madame Joseph specialised in the addition of forged cancels to stamps that were worth more used than unused.

<text>Laura Pergolizzi (born March 18, 1981), known professionally as LP, is an American singer, musician and songwriter from Huntington Station, New York. LP has released seven albums and three EPs. LP has written songs for other artists including Rihanna, Christina Aguilera, the Backstreet Boys, Leona Lewis, Mylène Farmer, Cher Lloyd and Céline Dion.

==Early life==
Pergolizzi was born on Long Island in 1981 to Italian-American parents, their paternal grandfather coming from Palermo and grandmother from Naples. Pergolizzi grew up in Huntington Station and attended Walt Whitman High School. Pergolizzi&#x27;s mother died when they were 16. They began using the name &quot;LP&quot; after moving to New York City in 2004.

==Career==
David Lowery of the band Cracker saw LP performing and featured them on &quot;Cinderella&quot;, a hidden track on the band&#x27;s 1998 album, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, which featured LP&#x27;s backing vocals on two other tracks. Lowery followed up by producing LP&#x27;s debut album &quot;Heart-Shaped Scar&quot;, released in 2001 through Koch Records. LP&#x27;s second album, &quot;Suburban Sprawl &amp; Alcohol&quot;, was released in June 2004 through Lightswitch Records. On the record, they collaborated with songwriter and music producer Linda Perry. However, in spite of extensive touring to promote the release and positive reviews from music critics, the album failed to gain widespread recognition.

===2006–2010===
In 2006, LP appeared at the music conference South by Southwest and reportedly sparked a bidding war amongst major music labels, eventually being signed by L.A. Reid to their The Island Def Jam Music Group record label, part of the Universal Music Group. However, due to artistic differences, LP left the contract. They signed with SoBe Entertainment in 2007, an independent record label, with the album tracks they have written at the major label. &quot;Love Will Keep You Up All Night&quot;, one of the tracks they had written at The Island Def Jam Music Group with Billy Mann, was released in late 2007 on the Backstreet Boys album, &quot;Unbreakable&quot;. LP wrote and performed &quot;Wasted&quot;, from the album &quot;Suburban Sprawl &amp; Alcohol&quot;. &quot;Wasted&quot; was used as the theme song for the TV series &quot;South of Nowhere&quot;, which aired on Noggin&#x27;s teen block, The N. MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Hills&quot; also featured LP&#x27;s song &quot;Damage Is Done&quot; in late 2009, and it was released on iTunes.

During 2009, LP started writing songs for other artists, including several songs which ended up on Heidi Montag&#x27;s album, &quot;Superficial&quot; released by Warner Music Group. LP co-wrote the single, &quot;More Is More&quot;, as well as the album tracks, &quot;Twisted&quot;, &quot;Hey Boy&quot; and &quot;Love It or Leave It&quot;. They also co-wrote other tracks for and with Montag, such as the Cathy Dennis co-written, &quot;Look How I&#x27;m Doin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I Do This&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot;. A song LP wrote with Alexander Kronlund, &quot;Standing Where You Left Me&quot;, was released on Erik Hassle&#x27;s debut UK album, &quot;Pieces&quot; released by Island Records and Republic Records. LP moved to Los Angeles in 2010.

===2011–2012===
In August 2010, it was announced that LP had signed with RedOne&#x27;s record label, 2011 Records. LP landed their first major breakthrough as a songwriter, co-writing Rihanna&#x27;s song, &quot;Cheers (Drink to That)&quot;, featured on Rihanna&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Loud&quot;, released on November 12, 2010, on Def Jam Recordings. &quot;Cheers&quot; features a vocal hook performed by LP (taken from Avril Lavigne&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;). In a 2010 interview with MTV News, Rihanna said: &quot;I love that song (&quot;Cheers&quot;). That is one of my favorite songs on the album. It makes you feel like celebrating. It gives you a great feeling inside like you want to go out and have a drink. ... People can&#x27;t wait for the weekend.&quot; LP&#x27;s major label songwriting breakthroughs continued, and they co-wrote &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, performed by Christina Aguilera. The song is featured on the &quot;Burlesque: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; album, which was released on November 22, 2010, through RCA Records.

In June 2011, LP co-wrote &quot;Afraid to Sleep&quot;, which was performed by NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; finalist Vicci Martinez and reached #10 on the iTunes Top Singles Chart. In September 2011, LP signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records. Shortly after, &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, written and performed by LP, was prominently used in a Citibank national television advertisement campaign. In April 2012, LP released their first major label album, &quot;Into the Wild: Live at EastWest Studios&quot;, a five-song live extended play, and started touring extensively including festivals such as SXSW, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Bumbershoot, Tropfest as well as Tokyo&#x27;s Sonic Boom and London&#x27;s Hyde Park. In 2012, LP became the first female Martin Guitar ambassador.

<text>In law, a warranty is an expressed or implied promise or assurance of some kind. The term&#x27;s meaning varies across legal subjects. In property law, it refers to a covenant by the grantor of a deed. In insurance law, it refers to a promise by the purchaser of an insurance about the thing or person to be insured.

In contract law, a warranty is a contractual assurance given, typically, by a seller to a buyer, for example confirming that the seller is the owner of the property being sold. A warranty is a term of a contract, but not usually a condition of the contract or an innominate term, meaning that it is a term &quot;not going to the root of the contract&quot;, and therefore only entitles the innocent party to damages if it is breached, i.e. if the warranty is not true or the defaulting party does not perform the contract in accordance with the terms of the warranty. A warranty is not a guarantee: it is a mere promise. It may be enforced if it is breached by an award for the legal remedy of damages.

Depending on the terms of the contract, a product warranty may cover a product such that a manufacturer provides a warranty to a consumer with whom the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship because it is purchased via an intermediary.

A warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty is expressly stated (typically, written); whether or not a term will be implied into a contract depends on the particular contract law of the country in question. Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at a point in time, or that the fact will continue into the future (a &quot;continuing warranty&quot;).

==Express warranty==

Express warranties are created when the seller makes a guarantee to the buyer that the product or service being offered has certain qualities. For there to exist an express warranty, a statement regarding the product or service must be made to the buyer and the statement must play a role in the buyer&#x27;s decision to purchase the product or service. If, after purchase, the buyer feels that the given statement was a misrepresentation of the actual product or service, the buyer can file for breach of express warranty.

==Implied warranty==

Implied warranties are unwritten promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, and the inherent understanding by the buyer, rather than from the express representations of the seller. 

== Sale of goods ==

Warranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible products) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold &quot;as is&quot; with no warranties. Each country, however, defines its own parameters with regard to implied conditions or implied warranties. The rules regarding warranties are largely standardised; i.e., the concepts of &quot;offer&quot;, &quot;acceptance&quot;, &quot;consideration&quot;, &quot;capacity to contract&quot; and &quot;intention to create legal relations&quot;. Those are the five elements to create a legally binding contract in the United States (all 50 states), England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each of the seven states of Australia, and all other common law countries. Countries with civil law systems, however, recognise legally binding contracts which are not supported by consideration.

===United States===
In the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code which provide for implied warranties. However, these implied warranties were often limited by disclaimers. In 1975 the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods. Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered. In some states, statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and &quot;lemon laws&quot; apply to motor vehicles.

Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted with variations in each state, provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an &quot;as is&quot; statement):

*The warranty of merchantability is implied unless expressly disclaimed by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase &quot;as is&quot; or &quot;with all faults.&quot; To be &quot;merchantable&quot;, the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer&#x27;s expectations. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects may violate the warranty if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit &quot;as passes ordinarily in the trade&quot;. In most states, products inherently come with implied warranty of merchantability; however, in states like Massachusetts under consumer protection law, it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers. (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 106: Section 2-316A)
*The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow.

==Defects In Materials and Workmanship==
A common kind of warranty on goods is a warranty that the product is free from material defects in materials and workmanship. This simply promises that the manufacturer properly constructed the product, out of proper materials. This implies that the product is not defective for the purposes for which it was made.

Warranties may be time limited, thus limiting the time the buyer has to make a claim for breach of warranty. For example, a typical 90-day warranty on a television gives the buyer 90 days from the date of purchase to claim that the television was improperly constructed. Should the television fail after 91 days of normal usage, which because televisions customarily last longer than 91 days means there was a defect in the materials or workmanship of the television, the buyer nonetheless may not collect on the warranty because it is too late to file a claim. Consumer protection laws implemented by statute, however, provide additional remedies as it is not usually expected that a television will last for only 90 days.

Time-limited warranties are often confused with performance warranties. A 90-day performance warranty would promise that the television would work for 90 days, which is fundamentally different from promising that it was delivered free of defects and limiting the time the buyer has to prove otherwise. But because the usual evidence that a product was delivered defective is that it later breaks, the effect is very similar.

One situation in which the effect of a time-limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds a normal lifetime of the product. If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out would not be able to collect on the warranty. But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a warranty claim in Year 6. On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years.

==Satisfaction guarantee==
In the United States, the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act of 1976 provides for enforcement of a satisfaction guarantee warranty. In these cases, the advertiser must refund the full purchase price regardless of the reason for dissatisfaction.

==Lifetime warranty==
A lifetime warranty is usually a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship that has no time limit to make a claim, rather than a warranty that the product will perform for the lifetime of the buyer. The actual time that product can be expected to perform is normally determined by the custom for products of its kind used the way the buyer uses it.

If a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period longer. For example:

* the Cisco Limited Lifetime Warranty currently lasts for five years after the product has been discontinued, but only if you know where you bought it from as the seller is responsible for administering it.
* HP Networking product lifetime warranties last for as long as one owns the product.

==Limited warranty==
A warranty may be limited in duration (as above) and/or in scope. In Avrora Fine Arts v Christie, Manson and Woods (a UK High Court case), the auctioneers had issued a &quot;limited warranty&quot; that a certain painting sold at auction had been painted by the Russian painter Boris Kustodiev, which experts subsequently stated was not the case. The sale was cancelled and the buyer was reimbursed, but further claims of negligence and misrepresentation were denied because they fell outside the warranty&#x27;s scope.

==Breach of warranty==
Warranties are breached when the promise is not performed at all, or not performed in accordance with the contract. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The statute of limitations depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an unfair business practice. In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from revocation of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer&#x27;s item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.

Some warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an authorized service provider. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may void (nullify) the warranty. However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner&#x27;s choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY (&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;) repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner.

If the defective product causes injury, this may be a cause of action for a product liability lawsuit (tort). Strict liability may be applied.

== Extended warranty ==
In addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell or offer extended warranties (also called service contracts). These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, &quot;acts of God&quot;, owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.

These types of warranties are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of reverse competition. For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts. Extended Warranties are mostly back to back underwritten by underwriters, who are the actual bearer of the risk.

== Representations versus warranties ==
Statements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally *pre*contractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is innocent, negligent or fraudulent. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term &#x27;represents&#x27; in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (although English law will look to the substance rather than the form of the representation to decide what it is), while in America &#x27;warrants and represents&#x27; is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting &#x27;state&#x27; or &#x27;agree&#x27;, and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.

== Product types ==

=== Appliance warranty ===
====Canada and United States====

Written warranties on new major appliances, such as refrigerators, kitchen stoves and dishwashers, usually cover the cost of parts and labor to repair defects in materials or workmanship which appear under normal home use.

Warranties often cover defects up to a year after purchase or delivery. However some exclude new owners when a house or appliance is sold within the year (Frigidaire, LG, Samsung). Others do let warranties transfer to new buyers (Amana, General Electric, Whirlpool). Some manufacturers cover refrigerators&#x27; sealed parts (compressors, tubing, etc.) for five years (General Electric, Samsung, Whirlpool) or seven years (LG) or ten years (KitchenAid).

Warranties on water heaters cover parts for 5 to 12 years in single family residences, one year otherwise. They do not cover new owners when a house or heater is sold; nor do they cover the original owner if the heater is moved to a second location.
Tank models from A. O. Smith do not allow heating elements to be replaced with lower (or higher) wattages, and do not cover renter-occupied single family. They end if the unit is flooded or ever uses desalinated or deionized water, such as municipal desalination plants or reverse osmosis filters.
Smith&#x27;s tank models for manufactured housing do not provide coverage if a whirlpool or hot tub is connected.

Tank water heater warranties exclude labor, liability for water damage, and shipping cost to return the old heater or parts. Tankless warranties do not exclude water damage; they cover labor for a year, and Ruud/Rheem covers return shipping on tankless models.
Smith&#x27;s tankless water heaters do not restrict coverage to a single family, and require professional installation.

Implied warranties under US law could extend for longer periods. However, most states allow the written warranties to include clauses which limit these implied warranties to the same time period as the written warranty.

=== Car warranty ===

====United States====

New car factory warranties commonly range from one year to five years and in some cases extend even 10 years, with typically a mileage limit as well. Car warranties can be extended by the manufacturer or other companies with a renewal fee.

Used car warranties are usually 3 months and 3,000 miles.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, types of warranties have been classified as either an: 
# original manufacturer warranty, 
# insurance warranty underwritten and regulated as insurance or 
# obligor warranty, typically written by a car dealership or garage.

In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which began to regulate insurance contracts in this context in 2005, determined that additional warranties sold by car dealerships are &quot;unlikely to be insurance&quot;. Insurance warranties may offer greater protection to the consumer.

=== Home Warranty ===
A home warranty protects against the costs of home and appliance repair by offering home warranty coverage for houses, townhomes, condominiums, mobile homes, and new construction homes. When a problem occurs with a covered appliance or mechanical system such as an air conditioning unit or furnace, a service technician repairs or replaces it. The homeowner may have to pay for a service call fee and the home warranty company pays the balance for the repair or replacement of the covered item.

===Intellectual property right warranty===
An intellectual property right (IPR) warranty provides contractual protection against breach of rights in software development and other fields where IPR is protected. Increasing reluctance on the part of suppliers to offer an IPR warranty or indemnity has been noted in recent years.

==Warranty data==
Warranty data consists of claims data and supplementary data. Claims data are the data collected during the servicing of claims under warranty and supplementary data are additional data such as production and marketing data. This data can help determine product reliability and plan for future modifications.

<text>Gerd Heidemann (4 December 1931 – 9 December 2024) was a German journalist best known for his role in the publication of purported Hitler Diaries that were subsequently proved to be forgeries, the work of Konrad Kujau.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Hamburg, Heidemann showed an early interest in photography, and began his career as a freelance photo journalist. He joined the permanent staff of the weekly magazine &quot;Stern&quot; in 1955. He proved to be a tenacious researcher and a determined traveller to exotic and dangerous locales, but a writer of limited ability. His early work included extensive research into the identity of author B. Traven.

In the 1970s, Heidemann bought the yacht &quot;Carin II&quot;, which had belonged to Hermann Göring, met his daughter Edda Göring and had an affair with her which lasted for five years. They entertained on the yacht and their guests included two Second World War generals, Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke.

===Hitler diaries===
Heidemann came forward with his story of lost diaries written by Adolf Hitler in 1983. He sold the rights to &quot;Stern&quot; for DM 10,000,000 (then approximately US$6 million), along with his tale about how they had been hidden in a barn in East Germany for many years. Several experts, including the British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, came forward to pronounce the diaries to be authentic. The &quot;diaries&quot; were exposed as fabrications and Heidemann was fired from Stern just weeks later. Following the revelations, Heidemann was arrested, tried and sentenced in 1985 to four and a half years in prison for fraud. Heidemann had also stolen some of the money from Kujau; and kept $600,000 of the money from Stern to acquire the diaries. He was renting expensive residences, buying new cars and jewellery and buying more Nazi memorabilia, of which a great amount was more of Kujau&#x27;s forgeries.

===Later life and death===
In 2002, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; alleged that Heidemann had worked as a double-agent for the Stasi, and that the publication of the Hitler diaries had been part of a Soviet and East German plan to embarrass and discredit the Capitalist West. In the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;The Reunion&quot; broadcast on 7 September 2008, Heidemann vehemently denied that he had ever been a spy for the Stasi.

By 2008, Heidemann was living in poverty in Hamburg, receiving a €350 monthly welfare payment. At the time he had extensive debt estimated to be €700,000. In 2013, Heidemann was lobbying for the return of the manuscripts citing a contractual obligation of Stern publisher Gruner + Jahr.

Heidemann died in Hamburg on 9 December 2024, at the age of 93.

<text>Heart-Shaped Scar is the debut studio album by American singer LP, released in 2001.

==Reception==
Allmusic reviewed the album positively, grading it with four stars out of five. Thom Jurek, who reviewed the album noted: &quot;LP&#x27;s debut, &quot;Heart-Shaped Scar&quot;, is a roaring, snotty, bratty, bad-ass pop/rock record full of killer riffs, crunching guitars, and LP&#x27;s voice, which is equal parts Maggie Bell, Pat Benatar, and Robert Plant ground like glass through a deep Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Lynyrd Skynyrd, blues-rock, and biker sensibility.&quot;
