<text>Brent Anderson (born June 15, 1955) is an American comics artist known for his work on &quot;X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills&quot; and the comic book series &quot;Astro City&quot;.

==Early life==
In junior high school, Brent Anderson discovered the pantheon of characters in Marvel Comics. The first Marvel comic he read was &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #69, &quot;By Ben Betrayed&quot; (Dec. 1967), &quot;They were a family who had super-powers and helped each other out. I wanted to be part of a family like that,&quot; he says. Anderson began writing and drawing his own comics on school binder paper, creating a pantheon of his own that included &quot;Radium the Robot&quot; and &quot;The Chameleon&quot;. After doing fanzine illustrations, Anderson&#x27;s first professional comics work appeared in the mid-1970s in independent/underground publications such as &quot;All-Slug&quot;, &quot;Tesserae&quot;, and &quot;Venture&quot;.

==Career==
Anderson was one of several artists to draw the comics adaptation of &quot;Xanadu&quot; in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #17 (Summer 1980). In 1981, &quot;Ka-Zar The Savage&quot;, written by Bruce Jones, became Anderson&#x27;s first regular series. The &quot;X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills&quot; graphic novel followed, as well as artwork on a number of Marvel Comics series, including the heroic space-opera &quot;&quot;. During this period, Anderson was active doing artwork for independent publishers Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, including the innovative cinematic comic &quot;Somerset Holmes&quot;. 

In 1995, Anderson co-created with writer Kurt Busiek and cover artist Alex Ross, the award-winning &quot;Astro City&quot;. Other work included J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s &quot;Rising Stars: Untouchable&quot; spin-off series written by Fiona Avery covering the life story of special assassin Laurel Darkhaven. Work continues on a 200-plus page graphic novel, &quot;Jar of Ashes&quot;, written by Shirley Johnston. Anderson worked with writer Marv Wolfman on a one-shot featuring Green Lantern and Plastic Man entitled &quot;Green Lantern/Plastic Man: Weapons of Mass Deception&quot;, released in December 2010. A &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; ongoing series written by Dan DiDio and drawn by Anderson began in September 2012. In June 2013, Busiek and Anderson relaunched their &quot;Astro City&quot; series as part of DC&#x27;s Vertigo line. The ongoing &quot;Astro City&quot; series concluded as of issue #52 in 2018.

In April 2022, Anderson was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Anderson and Kurt Busiek teamed up to contribute a new &quot;Astro City&quot; story to the anthology, which will harbor themes relevant to the events in Ukraine.

== Art style ==
Anderson&#x27;s work fits into the category of &quot;realism&quot; defined by Neal Adams, one of Anderson&#x27;s many artistic influences. Anderson&#x27;s work is known for its focus on character. &quot;My greatest joy in drawing comics comes when I&#x27;ve added nuance to a character with just the right expression and illustrated a scene that captures the perfect moment of mood. When the characters come to life I feel alive. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve dedicated my professional life to creating comics.&quot;

<doc id="850496" wikidata="Q28228435" url="?curid=850496" title="Meritorious Unit Award (U.S. Air and Space Forces)">
<text>The Meritorious Unit Award or MUA is a mid level unit award of the United States Air Force and United States Space Force. Established in 2004, the award recognizes those units who demonstrate exceptionally meritorious conduct in direct support of combat operations. Eligible service is retroactive to 11 September 2001.

==Criteria==
Approved in March 2004 by the Secretary of the Air Force, the Meritorious Unit Award is awarded in the name of the Secretary to recognize squadrons, groups, or wings for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding achievement or service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United States on or after 11 September 2001. The recommended unit must display such outstanding devotion and superior performance of exceptionally difficult tasks as to set it apart and above other units with similar missions. The degree of achievement required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Legion of Merit to an individual. Superior performance of the normal mission alone does not justify award of the MUC. Service in a combat zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat effort.

The MUA is worn immediately after the Gallant Unit Citation (GUC) and before the Air and Space Outstanding Unit Award (ASOUA). Additional awards of the MUA are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters.

The MUA is not awarded to any unit or unit component that was previously awarded the Air and Space Outstanding Unit Award, the Air and Space Organizational Excellence Award (ASOEA), or unit awards from other service components for the same act, achievement, or service. The component commander will automatically consider all disapproved Meritorious Unit Awards for the Air and Space Outstanding Unit Award.

<doc id="850497" wikidata="Q588755" url="?curid=850497" title="Tarzan and the Leopard Woman">
<text>Tarzan and the Leopard Woman is a 1946 American action film based on the Tarzan character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs and portrayed by Johnny Weissmuller. Directed by Kurt Neumann, the film sees Tarzan encounter a tribe of leopard-worshippers. It was shot in the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. Its plot has nothing in common with Burroughs&#x27; 1935 novel &quot;Tarzan and the Leopard Men&quot;.

==Plot==
Travelers near Zambezi are being killed, apparently by leopards. The commissioner asks Tarzan to look into the matter. Tarzan immediately doubts that leopards are the problem. At the same time, Tarzan, Jane, and Boy take in Kimba, a boy who claims to have become lost in the jungle. Kimba is the brother of Queen Lea, leader of a leopard cult. She has dispatched him to spy on Tarzan. Queen Lea also conspires with Ameer Lazar, a Western-educated doctor who resents the West&#x27;s domination of the area.

Kimba has a goal of his own: to take the heart of Jane, a deed that would make him a warrior in the eyes of the cult. The Leopard Men wear leopard skins that form a cowl and cape, with iron claws attached to the back of each hand. Queen Lea wears a headband, wrist bands, ankle bands, halter top and miniskirt made of leopard skin. She works her followers into a frenzy in an underground chamber, &quot;These skins are your disguise. These claws are your weapons. Go not as men, but as leopards. Go swiftly, silently.&quot;

They attack a caravan bringing four young teachers and bring the maidens back for sacrifice. They also capture Tarzan, Jane, and Boy. Tarzan brings down the roof of the cavern, destroying the cult and rescuing his friends.

The plot is summed up by these lines spoken by Tarzan (about Cheeta): &quot;If an animal can act like a man, why not a man like an animal?&quot;

== Critical reception ==
Writing in DVD Talk, critic Paul Mavis described the film as &quot;[c]ompletely ridiculous fun&quot; and &quot;straight-faced in its overripe campiness,&quot; further noting that &quot;[e]ven funnier is harried Tarzan&#x27;s domestic situation, where Jane, like Blondie to Tarzan&#x27;s Dagwood, is yapping and complaining about how the tree house is going to &#x27;wrack and ruin&#x27; because Tarzan is too lazy to get up off his ass and fix the giant clamshell shower.&quot; In critic Jeremy Arnold&#x27;s review for Turner Classic Movies, he wrote that the film &quot;stands today as a satisfying, action-packed entry in the series,&quot; but noted that contemporary reviews in &quot;Variety&quot; and The New York Times were dismissive of the film&#x27;s story, production values, directing, and acting.

<text>Sjálvstýri (previously Sjálvstýrisflokkurin) (English: referred to interchangeably as &quot;Independence&quot;, &quot;Self-Government&quot;, or &quot;Home Rule&quot;) is a liberal, autonomist political party on the Faroe Islands. It is currently led by the Mayor of Klaksvík, Jógvan Skorheim.

Nýtt Sjálvstýri traditionally supported greater autonomy for the Faroes within the Kingdom of Denmark, but in 1998 it agreed, as part of a coalition deal with Tjóðveldi and Fólkaflokkurin, to support national independence for the Faroes. Today it supports obtaining independence through gradually increasing Faroese autonomy until the Faroe Islands becomes a de facto independent state.

At the 2008 election to the Løgting, the party won 7.2% of the popular vote and two out of 33 seats. In early elections in 2011, the party&#x27;s vote fell to 4.2% and it lost one seat. At the 2011 election to the Løgting, the party won 4% of the votes; two members were elected.

<text>The Union Party (, ), also translated Unionist Party, is a conservative-liberal, agrarian political party on the Faroe Islands. The party wants to maintain the Faroe Islands&#x27; union with Denmark. On 24 October 2015, Bárður á Steig Nielsen succeeded Kaj Leo Johannesen as party leader.

In the elections in 2008, the party won 21.0% of the popular vote and 7 out of 33 seats. After having been in the opposition for a short interval after the elections, the Union Party formed a new government in September 2008, and Kaj Leo Johannesen became prime minister.

In the Danish parliamentary elections of 2007, the party received 23.5% of the Faroese vote, thereby gaining one of the two Faroese seats in the national legislature of Denmark.

At the general elections in 2011, the party gained 24.7% of the votes and eight seats out of 33. However, on 10 February 2014, the party gained one more seat in the Løgting, after Gerhard Lognberg who was elected to the parliament representing the Social Democratic Party, joined the Union Party. This happened three months after Lognberg had been expelled from the Social Democratic Party due to some disagreements, making the Union Party the joint biggest party of the Faroese parliament, along with the People&#x27;s Party.

<doc id="850507" wikidata="Q118446" url="?curid=850507" title="Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place at the Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre and featured 550 competitors taking part in 14 events.

The medals were split among 22 countries, Romania topping the medal table, their women winning 3 golds, with the traditionally strong Germany, Great Britain and Australia picking up four medals in total.

Romania&#x27;s Elisabeta Lipă won her fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal and fifth overall. Lipă, who was part of Romania&#x27;s women&#x27;s eight, won her first in Los Angeles in 1984 followed by gold medals in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004, a record span of 20 years between her first and last gold medal. It was also her eighth overall, which is more than any other rower, having won a silver and a bronze in 1988 and an additional silver in 1992. In winning her medal at age 39, Lipă became the oldest rower to win a gold medal and the oldest athlete in an endurance sport to win a gold medal.

Matthew Pinsent also won his fourth consecutive medal, this time without legendary partner Steve Redgrave. The British men&#x27;s coxless four of Steve Williams, James Cracknell, Ed Coode with Pinsent at stroke narrowly saw off the challenge of the World Champion Canadian crew of Cameron Baerg, Thomas Herschmiller, Jake Wetzel and Barney Williams. It was a dramatic stretch run with the lead literally changing hands with each stroke. (In rowing, the boat will surge depending on where the rowers are during the stroke. Pinsent would later say that he thought they had won because they were in the best part of the stroke when they crossed the line). Great Britain won with a time of 6:06.98, just 8/100ths of a second faster than the Canadians. Pinsent later wept at the medal ceremony.

Matching Lipă&#x27;s and Pinsent&#x27;s feat of four consecutive gold medals was German sculler Kathrin Boron in the women&#x27;s quadruple sculls. She had won the doubles event in Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000 and the quadruple sculls in Atlanta 1996.

Australian James Tomkins, competing in his fifth games at the age of 39, won his third gold medal, and fourth medal overall, teaming with his longtime partner Drew Ginn in the men&#x27;s pair. Tomkins and Ginn had been part of the straight four that won the gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and they had won the 1999 World Championship in the pair, but Ginn had missed the 2000 Sydney Olympics with a severe back injury, and Tompkins had finished third with a new partner Matthew Long in the pair. Tomkins was also the oldest male rower to win an Olympic gold medal, surpassing Steve Redgrave.

Norway&#x27;s Olaf Tufte won the men&#x27;s single scull, and Germany&#x27;s Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski won with women&#x27;s single scull beating two-time defending Olympic Champion Ekaterina Karsten.

The Romanian women&#x27;s pair of Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu took gold before doubling up to help their eight take gold, giving Damian her fourth Olympic Gold medal — having won 2 golds in Sydney in the same disciplines.

The United States won the prestigious men&#x27;s eight for the twelfth time overall and the first time since 1964. In the second preliminary heat, both the U.S. and Canadian crews broke the previous world best time, with the U.S. winning in 5:19.85, which stood as a world best time until the second World Cup regatta of 2012. The United States would go on to win the final.

<text>The Alfarista Radical Front (, FRA) was a centrist liberal party in Ecuador, founded in 1972. One of its best known figures was former acting president Fabián Alarcón.

The party was named after the most prominent liberal politician in Ecuadorian history, Eloy Alfaro, who founded the country&#x27;s first institutionalized Liberal Party in 1884.

In the 2002 Ecuadorian general election, the party supported the candidacy of Xavier Neira Menéndez.

<text>Entertaining Mr Sloane is a three-act play written in 1963 by the English playwright Joe Orton. It was first produced in London at the New Arts Theatre on 6 May 1964 and transferred to the West End&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre on 29 June 1964.

==Plot summary==

===Act 1===
Mr Sloane, a young man looking for a place to board, happens by the residence of Kath, a middle-aged landlady whose home is on the outskirts of a rubbish dump. Kath is eager to have Mr Sloane as a tenant at her home, which she shares with her nearly-blind father Kemp. Getting acquainted with Mr Sloane, Kath is open about a previous relationship she had which led to her bearing a child; her brother insisted that she give it up for adoption because it was conceived out of wedlock. Mr Sloane reveals he is himself an orphan, though vague about his parents&#x27; death, except that they &quot;passed away together&quot;. Kath&#x27;s father immediately distrusts Mr Sloane, believing him to be the man who killed his employer some years earlier. After Kemp and Sloane have an altercation that gets Sloane stabbed in the leg, Kath starts making subtle advances toward the young man. When he tries to reciprocate, Kath facetiously warns him not to betray her trust. Her brother Ed soon arrives and is dismayed to see his sister&#x27;s new boarder. Kemp has an estranged relationship with his son as he found him to be &quot;committing some kind of felony in the bedroom&quot; as a teenager. Despite Ed&#x27;s initial opposition to Mr Sloane staying with his sister, after speaking with him, Ed eventually relents and even offers him a job as his chauffeur. As Sloane recovers from his injury, Kath returns wearing a transparent negligee and seemingly seduces Mr Sloane as the lights go down and Act One ends.

===Act 2===
The action resumes &quot;some months later&quot; and begins with Mr Sloane recounting an evening in which a young woman gave him her telephone number. Kath ambiguously hints at her jealousy, then reveals that she is pregnant and concerned that her brother will strongly disapprove. Ed arrives soon after and discovers that Mr Sloane took his car out joyriding the night before with his friends. Upon finding out that they also had a woman with them, Ed divulges that he feels women are crude, and misleading. Ed advises Sloane to pack his things as he will be on call as his assistant at all hours. When Sloane leaves the room to pack, Kemp mildly attempts to reconcile with his son, and conveys that Kath and Sloane have been sleeping together and he believes that Kath is pregnant. When confronted, Sloane confirms he has been sleeping with Kath, but claims that she &quot;threw herself&quot; at him. A short time later, Ed departs to buy cigarettes, and Kemp returns to confront Sloane as his employer&#x27;s murderer. Sloane eventually attacks Kemp, resulting in his death.

===Act 3===
Upon finding his dead father, Ed is initially insistent that justice be served and Sloane be turned over to the police. However, Sloane persuades Ed to fabricate a story to make the death appear an accident, in exchange for his servitude. When Kath discovers the dead body, she is apprehensive to stray from the truth especially given Sloane&#x27;s intention to go and live with her brother. Sloane finds himself in a predicament: if he stays with Kath, Ed will report the murder to the authorities, and vice versa if he chooses to leave with Ed. Ultimately, a compromise is reached that will result in the pair &quot;sharing&quot; Mr. Sloane a few months at a time.

==Productions==
The play premiered in the West End in 1964, thanks to the financial support of Terence Rattigan, who had seen the play at the New Arts Theatre, rated it highly and put up £3,000 in sponsorship. It was directed by Patrick Dromgoole and starred Madge Ryan as Kath, Dudley Sutton as Sloane, Charles Lamb as Kemp, and Peter Vaughan as Ed. It was designed by Timothy O&#x27;Brien, with costumes supervised by Tazeena Firth.

The Broadway production, directed by Alan Schneider, opened at the Lyceum Theatre on 12 October 1965 and closed after 13 performances. It starred Sheila Hancock as Kath, Dudley Sutton as Sloane, Lee Montague as Ed, and George Turner as Kemp. William Ritman designed the sets and costumes.

The play was revived as part of the Joe Orton Festival at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Directed by Roger Croucher, it opened on 17 April 1975 and subsequently transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in July. It starred Beryl Reid as Kath, Malcolm McDowell as Sloane, James Ottaway as Kemp, and Ronald Fraser as Ed. Harry H. Corbett later took over as Ed and Kenneth Cranham as Sloane. John Gunter designed the sets and Deirdre Clancy supervised the costumes. It closed in October 1975.

A subsequent London production at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1981 was directed by Kenneth Williams and starred Barbara Windsor as Kath. Windsor reprised the role for a national tour in 1993 co-starring John Challis, Christopher Villiers, and Kenneth Waller, directed by John David, produced by Lee Dean, and designed by Mark Bailey.

An Off Broadway Revival in 1982 at the Cherry Lane Theatre won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. Produced by Howard Feuer, Jeremy Ritzer, Laurence Gordon and Sidney Shlenker and directed by John Tillinger, it starred Maxwell Caulfield as Sloane, Barbara Bryne as Kath, Gwyllum Evans as Kemp, and Jerome Dempsey as Ed.

In 1985 Greg Hersov directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Adam Ant as Sloane, Sylvia Syms as Kath and James Maxwell as Ed.

The Roundabout Theatre Company revived the play in 2005 under the direction of Scott Ellis. It starred Alec Baldwin as Ed, Chris Carmack as Sloane, Jan Maxwell as Kath, and Richard Easton as Kemp. The design team included Allen Moyer (sets), Michael Krass (costumes), Ken Posner (lights), and John Gromada (original music and sound).

In 1997 Dominic Cooke directed a production for Terry Hands&#x27; inaugural season at Clwyd Theatr Cymru, which was staged in the Emlyn Williams Theatre, and starred Joe McFadden as Sloane, Robert Blythe as Ed, Lynne Verrall as Kath, and Jimmy Gardner as Kemp.

In 2007, the Melbourne Theatre Company staged a production at the Fairfax Theatre in the Melbourne Arts Centre in Melbourne. Directed by Simon Phillips, it starred Richard Piper as Ed, Ben Guerens as Sloane, Amanda Muggleton as Kath, and Bob Hornery as Kemp. It was designed by Shaun Gorton, with music by David Chesworth.

From 29 January 2009, a production at the Trafalgar Studios in London starred Imelda Staunton as Kath, Mathew Horne as Sloane, Simon Paisley Day as Ed and Richard Bremmer as Kemp. Horne collapsed during a performance on 2 April 2009 with a suspected virus. The show played at the Trafalgar until 11 April 2009.

A 2012 production at the Comédie des Champs-Élysées in Paris, directed by Michel Fau (as &quot;Que faire de Mr Sloane?&quot;) featured Gaspard Ulliel in the title role, Charlotte de Turckheim as Kath and Fau as Eddie.

==Screen adaptations==
A television adaptation was broadcast by ITV in the &quot;Playhouse&quot; series on 15 July 1968, and directed by Peter Moffatt. It starred Sheila Hancock as Kath, Edward Woodward as Ed, Clive Francis as Sloane, and Arthur Lovegrove as Kemp. Originally made in monochrome on videotape by Associated-Rediffusion, it survives as a telerecording.

Clive Exton wrote the screenplay for a 1970 feature film directed by Douglas Hickox and starring Beryl Reid, Peter McEnery, Harry Andrews and Alan Webb.

<doc id="850519" wikidata="Q2054656" url="?curid=850519" title="Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party">
<text>The Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party (, abbreviated as &quot;PLRE&quot;) was a liberal party in Ecuador. Prior to its dissolution in 2006, it was one of the oldest existing political parties in Ecuador.

==History==
The party evolved out of divisions between moderate and radical liberals in the Liberal Party of Ecuador. As in many Latin American countries, Ecuador has experienced much conflict, often violent, between the Liberal and Conservative parties.

Eloy Alfaro brought the Liberal Party to power during the revolution of 1895. In 1925, the Liberal Party was officially founded as the Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party (PLRE). Over the next 50 years several of its members served as presidents of Ecuador. The party was in power from 1895 to 1911, from 1921 to 1952 and from 1960 to 1970. During each period of power the party was overthrown by military coups.

In 2000, and after a difficult period of time when the party was almost disappearing, Julio Eduardo Ponce Arteta stepped to the challenge as National Director of the PLRE and made the Liberal Party participate in the presidential elections again with the party&#x27;s candidate, Ivonne Baki. Couple of years later the party was unable to fulfill the necessary 5% of votes required to remain a valid political entity, the PLRE ceased to officially exist. Nonetheless, the PLRE retains recognition for its important role in Ecuadorian history and has reputedly inspired several other political parties. Similarly, the PLRE&#x27;s founding leader, Eloy Alfaro, is still widely revered in Ecuador.

In 2008, a political party with the same name was registered for the 2009 presidential elections.

<doc id="850521" wikidata="Q1616632" url="?curid=850521" title="Warkworth, Northumberland">
<text>Warkworth is a village in Northumberland, England. It is probably best known for its well-preserved medieval castle, church and hermitage. The population of Warkworth was 1,493 in 2001, increasing to 1,574 at the 2011 Census. 

The village is situated in a loop of the River Coquet, about from the Northumberland coast and lies on the main A1068 road. It is north of Newcastle, and about south of the Scottish border. An ancient bridge of two arches crosses the river at Warkworth, with a fortified gateway on the road mounting to the castle, the site of which is surrounded on three sides by the river.

Warkworth is popular with visitors for its old buildings, its walks by the River Coquet, and its proximity to the Northumberland Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). It is twinned with Warkworth, New Zealand, which is named after it.

==History==
A church has existed on the riverside site in the village for around 1,200 years. St Lawrence&#x27;s Church is a large and almost completely Norman building, which is unique in Northumberland. The first record of the village dates from 737AD when King Ceolwulf of Northumbria gave the church and village to the Abbot and monks of Lindisfarne. In 1174, the church was the scene of a massacre when some 300 people were brutally butchered by Duncan, Earl of Fife during a Scottish raid. John Law was vicar of Warkworth in the 1770s.

Warkworth Castle was founded at an uncertain date; traditionally its construction has been ascribed to Prince Henry of Scotland in the mid-12th century, but it may have been built by King Henry II of England when he took control of England&#x27;s northern counties. A timber castle was first documented in a charter of 1157–1164 when Henry II granted it to Roger fitz Richard. However it was considered &quot;feeble&quot;, and was left undefended when the Scots invaded in 1173.

Roger&#x27;s son Robert inherited and improved the castle. Robert was a favourite of King John, and hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213. The castle remained in the family line, with periods of guardianship when heirs were too young to control their estates. King Edward I stayed overnight in 1292 and John de Clavering, a descendant of Roger fitz Richard, made the Crown his inheritor. With the outbreak of the Anglo-Scottish Wars, Edward II invested in castles including Warkworth where he funded the strengthening of the garrison in 1319. Twice in 1327 the Scots besieged the castle without success.

The castle came to the House of Percy in Edward III&#x27;s reign and is still held by their descendants the dukes of Northumberland, despite some brief changes of ownership in the 15th century.

During the 18th century the castle was allowed to languish. The south-west tower was falling apart and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt towards the end of the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop Thomas Percy&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Hermit of Warkworth&quot;. In the mid 19th century Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland, undertook some preservation work. His successor, Algernon Percy, contracted Anthony Salvin to restore the keep.

The castle became a scheduled monument in 1915. In 1922 Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, granted custodianship of the castle to the Office of Works which had been made accountable for the guardianship of ancient monuments. The Duke&#x27;s Chambers remained under direct control of the Percys. The Office of Works undertook excavations in the moat in 1924 and removed the custodian from the gatehouse. English Heritage, who now manage and maintain the site, succeeded as the castle&#x27;s custodians in 1984.

In the 20th century Nikolaus Pevsner said of the imposing castle that the military engineer happened also to be a great architect. He went on: &quot;Warkworth must be approached from the north. With its bridge, its bridge-tower, then Bridge Street at an angle, joining the main street up a hill to the towering, sharply cut block of the keep, it is one of the most exciting sequences of views one can have in England.&quot;

Warkworth railway station was located approximately 1 mile west of the village. It was designed by Benjamin Green for the Newcastle and Berwick Railway. The station closed to passengers in 1958 and to goods traffic in 1962.

Due to Warkworth&#x27;s popularity, the village caters for large numbers of visitors throughout the year. Facilities include two pubs, two hotels, a number of cafés, restaurants and tearooms, a chocolate shop and patisserie, a general store, and several galleries and boutiques.

==Governance==
Warkworth is a major part of the electoral ward called Amble West with Warkworth. This ward stretches south to Acklington via Amble with a total population at the 2011 Census of 4,172.

==Sport==
The village is host to Warkworth Cricket Club, formed in 1874. The first XI team plays in the Northumberland Cricket League and has reached the last 16 of the National Village Cup on several occasions in the past 20 years, and is a regular contender for the Northumberland League title, winning three years running in 2001–03. The second XI which plays in the Alnwick and District Cricket League.

The junior section has over 60 members participating in under 9-year-old competitions and under 11, 13 and 15 leagues.

==Notable people==
*Rawdon Briggs (1853–1936), cricketer
*Sir Henry Percy, a late-medieval English nobleman. Known as Hotspur. Born in Warkworth (or Alnwick) in 1364, he led successive rebellions against Henry IV of England and was slain at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403.

<text>KSDK (channel 5) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Tegna Inc. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Market Street in Downtown St. Louis, and its transmitter is located in Shrewsbury, Missouri.

==History==
The station first signed on the air as KSD-TV on February 8, 1947. It was owned by the Pulitzer Publishing Company, publishers of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; and owners of KSD radio (550 AM, now KTRS). It was the ninth television station to sign on in the United States and the first television station in Missouri. The station&#x27;s original studios were located adjacent to the Post-Dispatch building on Olive Street. It was the second commercial station located west of the Mississippi River, following KTLA in Los Angeles, which had signed on just 17 days earlier. In the early days, KSD produced much of its own programming and developed its own talent pool. Many St. Louis television pioneers from KSD-TV came from radio, including Frank Eschen, Kay Morton, Russ Severin and Dave Russell.

Because of a freeze on new television station licenses imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), KSD-TV was the only television station in the St. Louis market, until WTVI (channel 54, now KTVI channel 2, a Fox affiliate) signed on in August 1953. Often known as simply &quot;Channel 5,&quot; the station has always been an NBC affiliate, owing to KSD radio&#x27;s longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network. The station is currently the longest-tenured affiliate in the market of any major broadcast television network. In its early years, Channel 5 also carried secondary affiliations with CBS, DuMont and ABC. In the early 1960s, Channel 5 became the first St. Louis television station to broadcast in color.

After Pulitzer sold KSD radio to Combined Communications Corporation in 1979 (prior to Combined&#x27;s merger into the Gannett Company that same year), KSD-TV, in order to comply with an FCC regulation in place then that stated that TV and radio stations in the same market, but different ownership had to use different call signs, modified theirs to the current KSDK on September 10, 1979. In 1982, the station relocated its studios from its original location on Olive Street to their present location on Market Street in Downtown St. Louis. In 1983, Pulitzer traded channel 5 to Multimedia, Inc. in return for WFBC (now WYFF) in Greenville, South Carolina, and WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in what was a rare instance of one company&#x27;s flagship station being traded for another. During the 1980s and 1990s, KSDK was the highest-rated NBC affiliate in the country, and it remains the most-watched NBC affiliate in the top 30 markets to this day, despite the network&#x27;s overall ratings decline that has occurred since the 2004–05 season.

In 1990, KSDK dropped the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding and rebranded its newscasts as &quot;NewsChannel 5&quot;; the station also began to operate on a 24-hour-a-day schedule. On July 24, 1995, Multimedia was purchased by the Gannett Company, with the acquisition finalized on December 4. In 1998, KSDK debuted the &quot;Window on St. Louis&quot;, a street-side studio located in the same downtown St. Louis building that also houses KSDK&#x27;s other studios. The local program &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; used this studio for broadcasts for nearly 20 years. The Window on St. Louis was modeled on &quot;Today&quot;″s &quot;Window on the World&quot;.
In an attempt to provide St. Louisans with local and national election results during the 2004 elections, KSDK partnered with PBS member station KETC (channel 9) to simulcast election coverage. The KSDK/KETC partnership continued through September 2005, when, along with radio partners KYKY (98.1 FM) and KEZK (102.5 FM), a telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief was simulcast.

KSDK produced the first broadcast of any local program in St. Louis in high definition, when it broadcast the St. Louis Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 24, 2005. Incidentally, the 2005 parade also marked the final year that the event, which had been a Thanksgiving Day tradition on KSDK, would be broadcast on the station, as the parade moved to CBS affiliate KMOV (channel 4) in 2006.

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for KSDK. Gannett threatened to suspend its contact with the satellite provider should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KSDK was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

In 2017, the station re-branded as &quot;5 On Your Side&quot;.

==Local programming==

=== News operation ===

KSDK presently broadcasts 37 hours of locally-produced newscasts each week (with six hours each weekday and hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station also produces five half-hour episodes of &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; each week.

KSDK dominated the news ratings in St. Louis for the better part of its first six decades on the air. KMOX-TV (now KMOV) took the lead in the late 1960s, but KSDK regained the #1 spot in the early 1980s and kept it for most of the next two decades, with some of the highest (and by some measures, &quot;the&quot; highest) rated newscasts in the nation. For much of that time, its main anchors stayed at the station for 10 years or more. At one point, its 6 p.m. newscast ended with local elementary schoolchildren flashing the hand signs for &quot;5&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, signifying that, as a promo featuring the kids said, &quot;Even a second grader could tell you that Channel 5 is number 1.&quot;

During the spring 2004 sweeps, it lost its first-place position at 10 p.m. to KMOV, and the two stations have traded the ratings crown in that timeslot several times since then. KMOV has also closed its ratings gap in several other timeslots, due in part to NBC&#x27;s overall weaker ratings since 2004. KSDK&#x27;s ratings dominance began to slip dramatically in 2009, first losing late news to KMOV, and then morning news to KTVI. In 2013, its ratings went into free fall. The November 2013 ratings book saw KSDK tumble into last place for the first time in its history. KTVI easily won the morning news and KMOV swept the rest.

A sports wrap-up program previously aired on Sunday evenings after the 10 p.m. newscast called &quot;Sports Plus.&quot; It was originally hosted by Mike Bush until he moved from sports director to news anchor in 2004, and then hosted by sports director Rene Knott, who became the news co-anchor of &quot;Today in St. Louis&quot;, KSDK&#x27;s weekday morning newscast, in 2017.

From August 1989 until September 2011, &quot;Today in St. Louis&quot; co-anchors Jennifer Blome and Art Holliday had one of the longest anchor pairings in U.S. local television history. In 2011, Holliday was reassigned to co-anchor a new half-hour 4 p.m. newscast alongside Kay Quinn that debuted on September 12, 2011, while Blome was paired with Pat McGonigle (formerly of WHEC-TV in Rochester) on the morning newscast.

On September 12, 2005, KSDK debuted a half-hour weekday newscast at 10 a.m., following the third hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;; the newscast was discontinued in September 2009, but returned on September 12, 2011, as an hour-long program (as a result, the fourth hour of &quot;Today&quot; airs on a one-hour delay at 11 a.m.). On February 6, 2006, KSDK became the first television station in St. Louis, and the seventh station in the United States, to broadcast all newscasts and locally produced programming in high definition; it also became the first St. Louis area station to stream all of its newscasts online. On August 13, 2007, KSDK debuted &quot;Online @ 9&quot;, a 10-minute news webcast on the station&#x27;s website that was tailored to an online audience. That online newscast has been discontinued.

On November 11, 2010, KSDK entered into a news share agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned ABC affiliate KDNL-TV, to produce two pre-recorded half-hour newscasts at 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. weeknights for that station starting on January 3, 2011 (prior to the agreement, KDNL had not run any local newscasts since it shut down its news department in October 2001); in addition, KDNL also aired weekend rebroadcasts of KSDK&#x27;s entertainment/features program &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot;. KDNL general manager Tom Tipton stated that the station did not want to run simulcast or repurposed newscasts in its efforts to return daily newscasts to channel 30. The arrangement was unusual given that KSDK and KDNL are both &quot;Big Three&quot; network affiliates, and the fact that the newscasts on both stations competed against one another. The agreement with KDNL was to have ended on December 31, 2013; however, it was extended for another month until January 31, 2014. 
On September 12, 2011, along with the relaunch of its 10 a.m. newscast and the addition of a 4 p.m. newscast, &quot;Today in St. Louis&quot; expanded from 2½ to three hours on weekday mornings, now running at 4–7 a.m.; while the noon newscast was reduced to a half-hour with &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; being moved to fill the remaining half-hour. With these additions, KSDK was reduced to only three hours of syndicated daytime shows to back up its newscasts outside of NBC network programming.

By 2014, KSDK had canceled its 10 a.m. newscast, with a now hour-long &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; taking up the 10 a.m. hour, with the noon newscast also expanding back to 60 minutes in length. By 2017, &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; was again only 30 minutes, with infomercials filling the 10:30 half hour. The noon news was typically 30 minutes long with occasional extensions to 60 minutes, with another infomercial filling the 12:30 slot. In 2017, KSDK&#x27;s noon news was discontinued, and replaced with a second run of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; In 2018, &quot;Today in St. Louis&quot; was reduced to two hours on weekday mornings, running from 5–7 a.m. In 2020, KSDK expanded &quot;Today in St. Louis&quot; back to 2½ hours, running at 4:30–7 a.m. In addition, KSDK revived its 10 a.m. newscast for a third time and has moved &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; to 10:30 a.m.

In October 2021, KSDK revived its noon newscast and moved their first of 2 &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; slots to 12:30 where it remained until The Ellen Degeneres Show ended in May 2022. After which, Inside Edition moved to 3:00 p.m. on KSDK from 4:30 on KMOV and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; reruns moved to 3:30 while all-new episodes continue to air at 4:30.

KSDK used to operate a Bell 206B3 JetRanger helicopter called &quot;Chopper 5&quot;, that was used for breaking news and severe weather coverage. To save money, the station began paying market leader KMOV to use video from its chopper in 2010. Its news reporting has also won the station a multitude of journalism awards including Regional Emmys, Gabriel Awards and Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards.

====2014 school security controversy====
In January 2014, KSDK faced criticism from educators and the community for an undercover piece on school security. On January 16, a KSDK videojournalist entered Kirkwood High School in Kirkwood to test the school&#x27;s security, wearing a hidden camera. This followed several other tests at local single-building elementary schools, whereas Kirkwood High School is a multi-building campus. Thus, Kirkwood was the only school where the employee entered without being questioned. School personnel became concerned when the KSDK employee asked to use a restroom and left the office in the opposite direction, and when the station would not confirm with the school that the employee&#x27;s visit was only a test, the school was placed on lockdown for 40 minutes, when a station representative finally confirmed that the employee&#x27;s presence was for a story. Investigative reporter Leisa Zigman apologized on-air for the chain of events leading to the lockdown, but the station stood by its story, claiming the lockdown did not occur until an hour after the videojournalist left. Despite a school spokesperson admitting changes to security needed to be made, KSDK was strongly criticized by viewers raising questions about journalistic ethics, and anchor Mike Bush led the 10 p.m. newscast on January 20 with a more formal apology, stating that the station was reviewing its procedures to ensure a similar incident would not occur again.

===Sports programming===
When KSD-TV signed on in 1947, it began a longtime association with the St. Louis Cardinals as the team&#x27;s flagship station. On May 8, 1966, during ceremonies for the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium, Bill Houska Sr. flew home plate from Sportsman&#x27;s Park to the new downtown stadium in &quot;Chopper 5&quot;. The station aired Cardinals games from 1947 to 1958, before losing the rights to KPLR-TV (channel 11) for the next four seasons. The Cardinals returned in 1963 and remained on channel 5 until 1987 – long after many other &quot;Big Three&quot; network affiliates dropped local sports event coverage. KSDK lost the rights to KPLR again after the 1987 season; the station also aired any Cardinals games as part of NBC&#x27;s broadcast contract with Major League Baseball from 1947 to 1989, including the team&#x27;s World Series victories in 1964, 1967 and 1982.

On December 7, 2006, KSDK re-obtained the television rights to Cardinals games effective with the 2007 season, ending a 19-year run on KPLR. KSDK aired an average of 20 locally produced Cardinals games each year, with most other games airing on Fox Sports Midwest outside the St. Louis market. KSDK lost the broadcast rights on July 15, 2010, when Fox Sports Midwest signed an exclusive contract with the team beginning with the 2011 season, ending the Cardinals&#x27; over-the-air telecasts. The final Cardinals telecast on channel 5 aired on October 3, 2010, with a game against the Colorado Rockies.

KSD-TV/KSDK has also been involved in airing games of St. Louis&#x27; two former NFL teams, the Cardinals and Rams; the station broadcast the Cardinals&#x27; home interconference contests from 1970 to 1987, when the Cardinals relocated to Phoenix, and again with the Rams from their arrival in St. Louis in 1995 until 1997, when CBS acquired the AFC package from NBC. It has aired all &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; games through NBC since 2006; all Sunday night games that the Rams took part in from then until their return to Los Angeles after the 2015 season were aired on Channel 5.

From 2006 to 2021, KSDK broadcast St. Louis Blues games that air via the &quot;NHL on NBC&quot;; this included the team&#x27;s victory in the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Other locally produced programming===
KSDK has had a long history of producing local programs, including the &quot;Wranglers Club&quot; with Texas Bruce (1950–1963), &quot;Corky&#x27;s Colorama&quot; with Clif St. James playing Corky the Clown (1963–1980), &quot;Newsbeat&quot; hosted by Dick Ford and John Auble (1976–1984), and &quot;Midday A.M.&quot; (c. 1979–1986).

Since September 5, 1995, KSDK has aired &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot;, which highlights local entertainment and other (mostly family-oriented) attractions around the St. Louis area. The program usually broadcasts from the &quot;Window on St. Louis&quot;, where local groups and organizations are allowed to bring signs to advertise their events, though it occasionally leaves the studio to broadcast from local attractions (such as the St. Louis Zoo, Busch Stadium, the Fox Theatre) or from surrounding communities (such as Waterloo, Illinois and Florissant) that have uncommon or unknown attractions that may be of interest to viewers; these &quot;Great Escapes&quot; (as the segment within the show is titled) usually occur during summer months. The program is sponsored and has advertorial segments which are disclaimed to be from the advertisers which sponsor them, which are then disclaimed at the end of each episode. Another short advertorial feature, &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; is carried in some prime time ad breaks.

During the 1980s, the syndicated daytime talk show &quot;Sally&quot; (hosted by Sally Jessy Raphael) originated from KSDK&#x27;s studios (Multimedia Entertainment, a subsidiary of former KSDK owner Multimedia, Inc., distributed the program nationally until the company&#x27;s 1995 merger with Gannett, with the distribution rights held by Universal Television Enterprises and then Studios USA Television until the show&#x27;s 2002 cancellation).

==KSDK in the community==
KSDK is active in several community-based and charitable projects. Here are some of the most well-known:
*&quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; is an Emmy Award-winning weekly segment which profiles one child placed within the foster care system who is in need of adoption. KSDK has partnered with the Foster and Adoptive Care Coalition for the segment, which debuted in 2002. In September 2018, The Foster and Adoptive Care Coalition announced KSDK&#x27;s &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot; segment had found 400 children forever homes. A secondary program, &quot;Little Wishes&quot;, allows viewers who are unable to adopt a foster child to add a little happiness to their life by purchasing a gift for him or her during the holiday season.
*&quot;Friend to Friend&quot; was a program that reminded viewers on the fifth of each month to perform a breast self-exam to detect breast cancer in its early, treatable stages. Viewers could also contact KSDK for an informational packet that included reminders on performing a self-exam. The station remains a sponsor for the Komen St. Louis More Than Pink Walk, which raises money for breast cancer research for Susan G. Komen for the Cure. In 2006, the St. Louis fundraiser overtook Denver as the largest Race for the Cure event in the country with more than 64,000 participants, with more than $2.5 million raised with over 65,000 participants in 2007.
*&quot;Volunteer 5&quot; was a weekly, week-long program that collected donations for a particular local charity or community organization. It operated as a telethon, with phone operators taking calls between 4 and 7 p.m. each weeknight from anyone wishing to donate time or a monetary payment. &quot;Volunteer 5&quot; provided more than $5 million annually in services and hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours to local non-profit organizations. The program began in 1993 to help those affected by the Great Flood of 1993, and ended in November 2005.
*The &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; aired each Labor Day weekend on KSDK until 2012 (having aired only in prime time on the Sunday before the holiday in 2011 and 2012), benefiting the Muscular Dystrophy Association to fund research to find a cure for muscular dystrophy and other diseases affecting the nervous and muscular systems. Anchor Mike Bush served as host of the telethon&#x27;s local segments, whose donations benefit the St. Louis chapter of the MDA. KSDK lost its status as St. Louis&#x27; &quot;Love Network&quot; station when the telethon abandoned its syndication model, changed its name to the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot; and became a two-hour network telecast on ABC (airing locally on KDNL-TV, channel 30) in 2013 and 2014; the event was discontinued in 2015. The station re-launched the &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot; in 2017, raising money for MDA St. Louis. That year the telethon was hosted by Mike Bush and Heidi Glaus, and streamed on the station&#x27;s website and on Facebook Live for three hours. In 2018, Mike and Heidi hosted the telethon for a longer period of time, streaming it online and on KSDK. In 2019, Anne Allred joined the telethon as Mike&#x27;s co-host. That year the pair raised more than $135,000 for the St. Louis chapter of the MDA. All money raised during the annual &quot;MDA Show of Strength&quot; stays in St. Louis.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:

Since August 28, 2013, digital subchannel 5.2 has been affiliated with Bounce TV; it is carried locally on Spectrum digital channel 127. The subchannel previously operated as &quot;First Alert Weather 5&quot;, which debuted in June 2005 as an affiliate of NBC Weather Plus (under the name &quot;NewsChannel 5 Weather PLUS&quot;), before affiliating with The Local AccuWeather Channel in December 2008, after NBC Weather Plus discontinued operations. On January 20, 2015, KSDK launched 5.3 which carries a feed of the True Crime Network, which launched the same day. On January 17, 2018, KSDK launched digital subchannel 5.4 which carried clips promoting Quest, a new multicast network which made its debut on January 29.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KSDK ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 5.

As part of the SAFER Act, KSDK kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<text>Quentin Compson is a fictional character created by William Faulkner. He is an intelligent, neurotic, and introspective son of the Compson family. He is featured in the classic novels &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; as well as the short stories &quot;That Evening Sun&quot; and &quot;A Justice&quot;. After moving north to study at Harvard College, he eventually commits suicide by drowning himself in the Charles River.

In 1929, Faulkner published &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; which chronicles Quentin&#x27;s childhood in postbellum Mississippi as well as the last months of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts at Harvard University, before hurling himself off a bridge on June 2, 1910. Quentin&#x27;s thoughts are articulated with Faulkner&#x27;s innovative stream-of-consciousness technique. In 1936, Faulkner published &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, which takes place before Quentin left for Harvard, in which Quentin attempts to solve and reflect on a mysterious tragedy in the past.

Quentin Compson is also the name of his niece, the illegitimate daughter of his sister Candace (Caddy).

== Commemoration ==
A plaque on the Anderson Memorial Bridge (commonly but incorrectly called Larz Anderson Bridge) over the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts, commemorates his life and death. The small brass plaque, the size of one brick, is located on the brick wall of the Eastern (Weld Boathouse) side of the bridge, just north of the middle of the bridge span, about eighteen inches from the ground in a small alcove. The text on the plaque has slightly changed as a result of renovations to the bridge; its original and current (as of 2017) text reads:

<text>The Bank of Finland (, ) is the Finnish member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Finland from 1865 to 1998, issuing the Finnish markka. It views itself as the fourth oldest surviving central bank in the world, after Sweden&#x27;s Riksbank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of France, having been originally created in 1811-1812 as the Office of Exchange, Lending, and Deposits of the Grand Duchy of Finland () before taking its current name in 1840. Unlike many other longstanding central banks, it has always been government-owned.

==History==

===Russian Empire===
In 1809, the Russian Empire annexed Finland and made it a Grand Duchy with its own administrative structure. One aim of the new authorities was to sever Finland&#x27;s previous economic integration with Sweden, including the use of the Swedish riksdaler as currency. To that effect, the Office of Exchange, Lending, and Deposits was chartered on and established on in Turku by Alexander I of Russia, partly modeled on the Bank of Sweden. It started operations in August 1812. It was owned and controlled by the Grand Duchy&#x27;s government, but from the start had its own capital and balance sheet. The Grand Duchy government was usually in surplus and did not use the Office to finance itself, allowing it to extend credit to the Finnish economy instead. It issued banknotes denominated in rubles and kopecks and provided credit to local landowners and merchants. Its design was inspired by Russian Secretary of State Mikhail Speransky, whose plans to create a similar institution for Russia itself were thwarted by the French invasion of Russia in mid-1812.

In 1819 the institution relocated to Helsinki. Its efforts to displace the Swedish currency were only partly successful, however, until both Sweden (in 1834) and Russia (in 1839) returned to the silver standard. In 1840, the remaining riksdaler banknotes in Finland were withdrawn from circulation and substituted by rubles, and the withdrawn riksdaler notes were exchanged for silver at the Riksbank in Stockholm. This allowed the Bank of Finland (which took that name in 1840) to accumulate a significant metallic reserve, start discounting bills of exchange, and generally become much larger and more liquid in the 1840s, in contrast to the Russian State Commercial Bank and other Russian public banks of the time. The Bank soon opened its first branches in Turku and Vaasa. From then on, Russian currency-denominated notes became the dominant means of payment in the Grand Duchy, and the Bank of Finland&#x27;s banknotes represented less than one percent of all banknotes circulating in the Russian Empire, thus Finland had effectively no monetary autonomy. Consequently, Finland suffered from the Russian monetary disorder associated with the Crimean War and its financially disastrous aftermath. The convertibility of its banknotes to silver was again restricted from April 1854.

Requests for greater protection from Russian monetary vagaries developed in parallel with the Russian efforts at monetary stabilization, including the establishment of the State Bank of the Russian Empire in 1860 and subsequent reforms initiated by finance minister Michael von Reutern. On , Alexander II authorized the Bank of Finland to issue its own denomination, the Finnish markka, defined as a quarter of the Russian paper ruble (and thus nearly equal in value with the French franc at the time). In 1865, the Bank of Finland finally secured monetary policy autonomy when Finnish Senator Johan Vilhelm Snellman obtained from Alexander the right to keep the markka linked to the silver standard irrespective of the ruble&#x27;s situation, which was implemented in March 1866. From then on, the Bank of Finland effectively set its own monetary policy, making the Grand Duchy a separate currency zone from the rest of the Russian Empire, with the markka fluctuating in the range of 2.79 to 3.60 to the ruble between 1866 and 1875.

In 1868, the ownership and oversight of the Bank was transferred from Finland&#x27;s executive Senate to its recently revived legislative Diet (from 1906, the Parliament of Finland), thus strengthening its independence and accountability along the lines adopted by Sweden. To reflect the Bank&#x27;s new institutional position, plans were made to move it away from its location in the southern wing of the Senate Building in central Helsinki. The bank purchased a nearby plot of land in 1875 and held a design competition in 1876, which was won by Balto-German architect Ludwig Bohnstedt. The new building&#x27;s construction started in 1878 and was completed in 1883.

In 1876, Alexander II assented to Finland&#x27;s shift from silver to the gold standard. This was implemented in July 1878, when the Bank of Finland unilaterally joined the Latin Monetary Union, a stance it kept until the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, the Russo-Turkish War had again plunged Russia into monetary turmoil, and the ruble remained only partly convertible into markka (coins in small quantities). Even after Russia joined the gold standard in 1897, an imperial decree issued in 1904 restored the legal tender status of Russian ruble gold coins in Finland, but was never implemented because of the Russo-Japanese War.

===Independent Finland===

Shortly after the independence of Finland in late 1917, the civil war erupted. The Red Guards occupied the Bank of Finland&#x27;s head office together with other strategic points of Helsinki in late January 1918 and secured control of the printing presses. The bank&#x27;s professional staff refused to obey them, however, and the gold reserves had been precautionarily removed to the branch in Kuopio in Northern Finland; The Reds tried to seize the reserves in Kuopio by force in early February, but withdrew after a weeklong battle. 

Red leader Anton Huotari became the chair of the Executive Board in Helsinki, in competition to governor , who remained in Stockholm during the civil war, and the other Executive Board members who stayed with the White government in Vaasa. The White side remained in control of the gold reserves, half of the branch network in Finland, and foreign assets, but suffered from a cash shortage as it had no capacity to print banknotes. The German troops fighting the Battle of Helsinki eventually retook control of the head office on , and the Bank of Finland reopened for business on .

After these dramatic events, the Bank of Finland kept facing high inflation, but eventually managed to stabilize the markka in 1923 at about ten percent of its prewar gold value. It returned to the gold standard in 1926, but floated again in the wake the European banking crisis of 1931. In the spring of 1933, it pegged the markka to the pound sterling. During the interwar period, the Bank acquired great prestige in the new country, linked to the leadership of its longstanding governor Risto Ryti who became Prime Minister of Finland in December 1939 and President a year later in the midst of the Interim Peace.

The Bank&#x27;s head office building was damaged by Soviet bombing during the Continuation War air raids of 1944. After World War II and a renewed inflationary episode until the early 1950s, the Bank of Finland managed the country&#x27;s regime of financial repression, then liberalization in the 1980s. The markka was devalued on multiple occasions until finally floating in September 1992.

New practices and technologies led the Bank of Finland to phase out its local branch network, starting with closing the Hämeenlinna branch in 1963. In the years 1991–1994, eight other branches were closed, leaving only Turku, Tampere, Kuopio, Oulu and Vantaa in operation. The Turku branch was closed in 2007, those in Tampere and Kuopio in 2012, and the Oulu branch in 2019.

Following the 1990s Finnish banking crisis, financial supervision was reorganized in Finland with the creation of the Rahoitustarkastus (Rata) in 1993, an independent banking supervisor which is part of the Bank of Finland albeit with its own separate governance. In 2009, the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority was formed by merging Rata with the previously separate insurance supervisor.

At the start of Economic and Monetary Union, Bank of Finland Governor Sirkka Hämäläinen joined the inaugural Executive Board of the European Central Bank on , becoming its first female member.

==Mandate, ownership and organization==

The Bank of Finland is Finland&#x27;s central bank and a member of the European System of Central Banks and of the Eurosystem. It is Finland&#x27;s monetary authority, and is responsible for the country&#x27;s currency supply and foreign exchange reserves.

The Bank of Finland is owned by the Republic of Finland, and governed by the Finnish Parliament through the Parliamentary Supervisory Council and the Board of the bank. The Board is responsible for the administration of the bank, and the Parliamentary Supervisory Council for supervising the administration and activities of the bank and for other statutory tasks. The bank is governed under the provisions of the Act on the Bank of Finland, passed in 1998.

The bank had a staff of about 380 persons in 2017.

The highest official in the bank is the Governor who also chairs the board. Members of the Board were Olli Rehn (Governor), (Deputy Governor) and .

==The Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies==

 (BOFIT) is the Bank of Finland&#x27;s research institute specializing in emerging economies, focusing mainly on monitoring and analyzing the economic development in Russia and China and conducting related academic research. It was created in 1991, and derives its name from the Bank of Finland (BOF) and the Finnish name (IT) meaning Eastern Studies.

<text>Balder the Brave is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is based on the deity Baldr from Norse mythology.

==Publication history==

Created by editor-plotter Stan Lee and penciller Jack Kirby, Balder first appeared in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #85 (October 1962).

==Fictional character biography==
Balder is the son of Odin, the ruler of the Norse gods of Asgard, and the half-brother of Thor. He is companion to the Warriors Three and often aids Thor against his foes, which include Loki, their adopted brother, the Executioner and Enchantress, the Enchanters Three, the Wrecker and Mangog. At the request of Heimdall, Balder warns Thor when the Storm Giant Skagg and the fire demon Surtur are released by Loki in a plot to kill Odin. Balder is also briefly named ruler of Asgard during Thor&#x27;s quest to find a then-missing Odin.

Balder is beloved by most who know him. When he is threatened with execution for ignoring the call of battle for the sake of a fallen bird, his men beg Odin to take one of their lives instead.

As in mythology, the death of the Marvel version of Balder is the catalyst for Ragnarök and the destruction of Asgard. To prevent this, Odin casts a spell to make Balder vulnerable again. Ragnarök is nearly triggered when Loki has the blind god Hoder accidentally kill Balder with a mistletoe arrow but is averted by Odin, who creates a shield around Balder&#x27;s pyre. Odin later restores Balder to life when the Asgardians, after being slain in a battle with the Celestials, are resurrected by Thor using portions of energy donated by other gods. On a second occasion, Balder is traumatized by a near-death experience as he sees the souls of those he has slain in battle. He then renounces killing. It is later revealed that to escape Hel, Balder was forced by Hela to again kill all of those &quot;tens of thousands&quot; he had previously slain in battle. This epic confrontation lasts so long that Balder&#x27;s hair has turned white when he finally emerges victorious. Volstagg of the Warriors Three takes it upon himself to become Balder&#x27;s boon friend in an attempt to lift him out of his long depression. While Balder treasures the friendship, Volstagg&#x27;s efforts do little to soothe him. 

Balder also has a love-hate relationship with Karnilla, the Queen of the Norns, who aids both Loki and Asgard at times. On one occasion, Karnilla forces Balder to renounce Odin and serve her, whilst on another she joins forces with Asgard against Surtur at Balder&#x27;s request. Her emotions are roused by Balder&#x27;s deep depression as she feels Loki has ruined a unique member of the Asgardians. Karnilla&#x27;s lust for Balder inadvertently causes the death of Balder&#x27;s love, Nanna—an act that Balder does not forget.

Balder later accepts his warrior aspect and saves Karnilla&#x27;s people from a rogue giant&#x27;s spell. Balder and the other Asgardians (with the exception of Thor) eventually perish during the final Ragnarok, though Balder is later found inhabiting the armor of the Destroyer.

Loki reveals that Balder is the son of Odin and Frigga and the half-brother of Thor, making him a prince of Asgard. When Thor is forced to kill his reborn grandfather, Bor, Loki coerces Balder—now a royal prince—to exile the Thunder God. Balder then assumes the throne of Asgard. When Loki has the Asgardians moved to Latveria, he is shown at a banquet held by Doctor Doom. Balder asks why they could not invite Thor since the Asgardians were now in Latveria. Loki calmed Balder down to prevent Doctor Doom from reacting to the comment. 

Balder meets a diner owner named Bill (who fell in love with Kelda and followed her to Latveria) and gives him a cloak to keep warm. Balder later witnesses Bill&#x27;s assault by Loki&#x27;s henchmen due to Bill&#x27;s discovery of the evil nature of Loki&#x27;s scheme with Doctor Doom. After fending them off, Bill dies in Balder&#x27;s arms after revealing Loki&#x27;s plot and asking Balder to tell Kelda that he loves her. Balder and the other Asgardians retaliate even after Doctor Doom kills Kelda. Balder and the other Asgardians are forced to fight Endrik (who has been modified with technological implants) and many other mutilated Asgardians. Balder and the other Asgardians continue their fight with the mutilated Asgardians while Thor battles Doctor Doom. Balder kills the mutilated Asgardians to get to Kelda&#x27;s heart. After Loki restores Kelda to life and Thor defeats Doctor Doom&#x27;s Destroyer armor, Balder leads the Asgardians back to Broxton, Oklahoma. Back in Asgard, Balder is concerned about his foolishness over allowing what transpired in Latveria. Loki assures him he is a fine king.

During the &quot;Siege&quot; storyline, Loki warns Balder that Norman Osborn is rallying an army to invade Asgard following the incident with Volstagg and the U-Foes at Soldier Field. Balder is later informed about the situation with Volstagg by Hogun and Fandral. When Captain America arrives with the New Avengers and the Secret Warriors, Balder is pleased that Thor&#x27;s allies have joined the battle. Balder remains King of Asgard after the failed Siege but is stricken with great guilt, believing his rule has led to nothing but ruin. However, Thor persuades him to remain monarch and accept him as his new Chief Advisor.

Balder attends the Council of Godheads convened to counter the imminent universal threat of the &quot;Chaos King&quot; and his impending &quot;Chaos War&quot; to decide which mortal paragon they would choose to combat Mikaboshi. Vali Halfling later appears to the Council and challenges them to disprove their impotence by stopping him before he attains godhood. Balder tells Anansi that Halfling was the son of Loki and banished to Midgard long ago. When the Chaos War eventually nears Earth, the Council summons Hercules, Amadeus Cho and Delphyne Gorgon before them and commands them to bow before the Council&#x27;s authority. In return, the newly restored and empowered Hercules fights and easily bests most of them, including Balder.

After Mikaboshi overthrows the Underworld, and Hela and Pluto are overwhelmed by his devastating forces, Balder calls for the Council to fight alongside him against the Chaos King. The Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu seals the throne room of the Celestial Axis, claiming that if he went now, Mikaboshi would be able to trace him back to the Axis and subsequently invade all their realms. However, Mikaboshi breaks into the Celestial Axis after Hercules pierces the veil shielding it and launches an assault on all of Earth&#x27;s pantheons, seemingly slaying all of them with brutal ease and slaughtering many deities, although Balder is one of the survivors.

==Powers and abilities==
Balder is said to be the fastest and most agile of all the Asgardian warriors, his speed rivaled only by Hermod. Thor notes that Balder can move faster than the &quot;speed of light&quot; and is too fast to strike, so Thor must use his lightning to disarm him (and break the spell three troll witches had cast upon him). Balder possesses superhuman strength superior to the average Asgardian male and, like all Asgardians, superhuman endurance and longevity (via the Golden Apples of Idunn). He is immune to all Earthly diseases and has some resistance to magic. Courtesy of a spell cast by his mother and Asgardian goddess Frigga to try to avert Ragnarök, Balder is almost invulnerable while within the Asgardian dimension, unable to suffer harm from virtually any living or non-living being. Only weapons made of mistletoe wood can harm or cause fatal injury to him, or he can will himself to be vulnerable. Balder can also die in the Asgardian dimension through means that do not involve weaponry: for example, he could starve to death or be asphyxiated. It is unknown whether Balder also becomes vulnerable when he is in dimensions other than Asgard or Earth.

Being the Asgardian god of light, Balder could, after a period of intense training, also generate low light as well as heat strong enough to melt the entire fortress of Utgard-Loki and reduce him and his fellow Frost Giants to a tiny size. He is shown to retain this ability even on Midgard after many months, as shown in the events of &quot;Siege&quot;, albeit possibly with the aid of his enchanted blade. He can communicate with animals, and has also demonstrated minor magical talents on rare occasions, such as shielding himself from mortal eyesight while flying to Earth on Odin&#x27;s steed in one instance when he sensed that Thor was in danger on Earth while Balder was in Asgard, or teleporting himself and Sif (without the use of the latter&#x27;s enchanted sword) to Earth from Asgard in another. Though Balder can project some degree of energy, unlike most of his brethren, his ability to do so is far less than that of the other gods of light in other pantheons (namely Apollo, who can control at least double the amount of energy as Balder). He is also a highly skilled weapons master, wielding the enchanted sword of Frey, capable of fighting of its own accord, with millennia of extensive experience and training, and is a proficient tactician and master horseman, having been entrusted with several special missions by Odin.

Balder becomes a member of Earth&#x27;s Council of Godheads following Thor&#x27;s banishment.

The NDP does not have a leader in the Senate of Canada since it opposes the existence of that body.

<doc id="850551" wikidata="Q1175386" url="?curid=850551" title="David M. Kennedy (politician)">
<text>David Matthew Kennedy (July 21, 1905May 1, 1996) was an American politician and businessman. He served as the 60th U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and later as the 8th U.S. Ambassador to NATO, both under U.S. President Richard Nixon. He was Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board of Continental Illinois during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early life==
Kennedy was born on July 21, 1905, in Randolph, Utah, to George and Katherine Kennedy (née Johnson). His father was a rancher and served in Utah state government. His mother was ill for much of his childhood and the family grew up in Kaysville and later Ogden. His grandparents John Kennedy and Peter Johnson formed the Bank of Randolph.

As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Kennedy married Lenora Margaret Bingham in the church&#x27;s Salt Lake Temple in November 1925. Shortly thereafter he served as a missionary for the church in Liverpool, England. His mission presidents were James E. Talmage and John A. Widtsoe.
Kennedy attended public schools and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Weber State University, graduating in 1928. His first government job was as a staff member for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. During this time he built up his financial experience and later became assistant to then-Fed Chairman Marriner Eccles. Kennedy was also attending George Washington University and received master&#x27;s and law degrees from there in 1935 and 1937. He completed the Stonier Graduate School of Banking program, then housed at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, in 1939.

==Chicago years==
He left the Federal Reserve and joined Continental of Illinois in 1946, starting in their bond department. By 1951, he was a bank President and later served as Chairman of the Board and CEO from 1959 to 1969. At the time of his appointment as Treasury Secretary in 1969, Continental Illinois ranked as the 15th largest bank in the world.

Kennedy served as counselor to John K. Edmunds in the presidency of the LDS Church&#x27;s Chicago Stake. He was also a member of the board of Nauvoo Restoration from its founding in 1962, and advised David O. McKay, Harold B. Lee and other LDS Church leaders on banking matters. It was in part due to the advice of Kennedy that McKay restructured the management of Zions First National Bank so that the church&#x27;s president no longer held the title of bank president, with Orval Adams assuming that title.

During these same years, Kennedy also served as chairman of Mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s Mayor&#x27;s Committee for Economic and Cultural Growth in Chicago. In 1957, Kennedy became a member of the board of trustees of the University of Chicago. While serving in this post, he was involved in fundraising. In 1966, he was asked to head a fundraising drive for Brigham Young University (BYU). He worked on this project until becoming the US Treasury Secretary.

From 1961 until January 1969, Kennedy was a member of the board of trustees of the Brookings Institution. In 1963, he commissioned a house in Winnetka, Illinois.

==Government service==
Kennedy served as a special assistant on debt management to Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey. He also served on the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system from 1930 to 1946, ending up assistant to the Chairman.

In October 1962, U.S. President John F. Kennedy (no relation) appointed him a member of a private corporation (COMSAT) to own and operate the United States&#x27; share of a global satellite communications system. He was elected to the permanent board of directors in 1964.

In 1967, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Kennedy as chairman of the Commission on Budgetary Concepts, whose recommendations were adopted as standard government budgetary practice.

Kennedy was nominated by Nixon to be the 60th Secretary of the Treasury. He served from 1969 until 1971. Nixon, who had little interest in economics and expected his top economic advisers to run that portfolio, fairly quickly concluded that Kennedy was not up to the task, being weak both on policy-making and as a lead economics spokesman for the administration. Nixon concluded Kennedy was a &quot;cipher&quot; and by April 1970 told aide John Ehrlichman that Kennedy was to be replaced.

Kennedy served as the U.S. Ambassador to NATO from March 1972 to February 1973.

He founded the US-Taiwan Business Council in 1976, and served as its Chairman for fourteen years, until 1990.

==Church service==
He also served as a special representative of the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency. This assignment required him to represent the church around the world, meeting with government and ecclesiastical leaders.

In 1985, the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at BYU opened and is named in his honor.

His wife, Lenora Bingham, died on August 24, 1995. Kennedy himself died in Salt Lake City, Utah, on May 1, 1996, from cardiovascular disease and congestive heart failure, at the age of 90. He was interred in Randolph City Cemetery, near to his birthplace in Randolph, Utah.

<text>KETC (channel 9) is a PBS member television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, owned by St. Louis Regional Public Media. The station&#x27;s studios are located at the Dana Brown Communications Center on Olive Street in St. Louis&#x27; Grand Center neighborhood, and its transmitter is located in south St. Louis County.

==History==

The station first signed on the air on September 20, 1954. It was the first community-licensed educational television station in the United States. The station&#x27;s first general manager was Charles Guggenheim, who hired the technical staff and first group of producer/director/writers, five in all. While waiting for the broadcasting tower to be completed, a number of programs were recorded using kinescope recording technology (the same as used for &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;). Once on the air, there were a number of award-winning programs produced by Mayo Simon, Bill Hartzell, Ran Lincoln and Guggenheim. They included the first live broadcast of the St. Louis City Council. Another featured the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; nature columnist Leonard Hall of Possum Trot Farm. Among the taped program series was a pioneering science program intended for sixth graders to see in their classrooms, &quot;Science in Sight&quot;, produced by Martin L. Schneider. Film making was encouraged, and with Len Hall&#x27;s collaboration a documentary film about the rare beauty of the relatively unprotected Current River was produced. It was later used by the National Audubon Society in the successful effort to make Current River the first National Scenic River under the protection of the National Park Service.

Soon after the station went live, its emphasis on current affairs and local politics, fostered by Guggenheim, rattled the political leaders. Following a public controversy, covered by the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;, and under the influence of the well-connected local public relations firm Fleishman and Hillard (now FleishmanHillard), Guggenheim was replaced by Martin Quigley, who had no experience in broadcasting. A few months later, Shelby Storck was hired. An experienced broadcaster recommended by Guggenheim, he emceed the station&#x27;s first evening of broadcasting.

KETC originally broadcast from temporary studios in McMillan Hall on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, with transmitting facilities atop the former Boatmen&#x27;s Bank Building (now the Marquette Building) in downtown St. Louis. In 1955, it moved to the Julius and Freda Baer Memorial Building, also on the Washington University campus. It was the first facility specifically built for an educational television station. It activated its current tower in south St. Louis County in 1970, allowing it to begin color broadcasts a year later. In 1998, the station moved its studios from the Washington University campus to the Dana Brown Communications Center in the Grand Center district.

During the 2004 elections, KETC partnered with area NBC affiliate KSDK (channel 5) to provide St. Louisans with comprehensive and up-to-date local and national election results. This partnership was first utilized to simulcast a gubernatorial debate between Republican candidate Missouri Secretary of State Matt Blunt and Democratic candidate State Auditor Claire McCaskill. On election night (November 2), KSDK aired NBC&#x27;s prime time election coverage with Tom Brokaw and Tim Russert as well as segments of local results. KETC, meanwhile, ran three hours of local election results hosted by KSDK anchors Mike Bush and Karen Foss. Viewers could also watch election results online on the websites of both stations.

The successful KETC/KSDK partnership was used again in September 2005 when, along with radio partners KYKY (98.1 FM) and KEZK-FM (102.5 FM), a telethon for Hurricane Katrina relief was simulcast that raised more than $5 million. The telethon featured an appearance by Affton native John Goodman, who now calls New Orleans home and whose family went missing for a time during the storm&#x27;s peak. Kennett, MO native Sheryl Crow and her then fiancé Lance Armstrong urged viewers to call when they were interviewed by phone from the region.

In May 2008, E! contracted with KETC to film two episodes of the cable network&#x27;s weekly pop culture series &quot;The Soup&quot; at the KETC studios to accommodate host Joel McHale&#x27;s filming of &quot;The Informant!&quot; in the St. Louis area. After being known for most of its history as &quot;KETC 9,&quot; the station rebranded itself as &quot;The Nine Network&quot; in 2010. On October 13, 2010, the station partnered with the &quot;St. Louis Beacon&quot;, an online-only, non-profit news publication, to form the Public Insight Network, a citizen journalism initiative created in conjunction with American Public Media. On January 10, 2021, the station rebranded as Nine PBS, adopting the current PBS corporate logo.

==Programming==
KETC is known among viewers in St. Louis for preempting PBS programs to air library program content or less controversial pledge drive programs, such as WQED-produced doo-wop specials, using the default network feed in late night to premiere those PBS programs instead, though St. Louis has traditionally had stations, commercial and non-commercial, preempt programming from their networks due to content. KETC has given some leeway as far as some preemptions, such as a case where &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; columnist Eric Mink wrote an editorial complaining about the station&#x27;s scheduling of a pledge drive ice skating show instead of a PBS documentary on the September 11 attacks; KETC announced the next day that it would instead air the 9/11 documentary as nationally scheduled.

Some of the programs produced by KETC for national distribution include selected episodes of &quot;Inside/Out&quot; and &quot;Today in Chess&quot;, produced in cooperation with the Saint Louis Chess Club. The station also produced &quot;The Letter People&quot;, an instructional program about reading, which was seen on many PBS and educational television stations in the mid-1970s, as well as &quot;A Time for Champions&quot;, an hour-long documentary chronicling the Saint Louis University soccer dynasty of the 1960s and 1970s; and &quot;Homeland&quot;, a miniseries examining the topic of immigration in the United States. Local programming is highlighted by magazine series &quot;Living St. Louis&quot;, early-childhood focused &quot;Teaching in Room 9&quot;, and current affairs show &quot;Donnybrook&quot;, a weekly panel discussion featuring area media personalities airing on Thursday nights.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KETC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 39, using virtual channel 9.

<doc id="850573" wikidata="Q16995616" url="?curid=850573" title="1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election">
<text>The 1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election was held on 25 November 1999 after the member of Parliament for the constituency, Alan Clark (Conservative), died of a brain tumour on 5 September 1999.

This was the first safe Conservative seat to have a by-election in the 1997–2001 UK Parliament. There was immediate speculation that Michael Portillo, the most high-profile casualty of the 1997 general election, would use it to return to frontline politics. Portillo immediately confirmed his interest in the seat, but was then confronted with the publication of an interview he had given previously that summer in which he had confirmed that while at Peterhouse, Cambridge he had had homosexual affairs.

Portillo was selected as Conservative candidate but faced demonstrations organised by gay rights group OutRage! and its principal campaigner Peter Tatchell who protested against his vote for an unequal age of consent for gay and straight sex, and support for the ban on homosexuality in the UK armed forces while Secretary of State for Defence. Tatchell continued to try to confront Portillo throughout the election, not assuaged by Portillo saying that he had changed his mind on the age of consent.

The Labour Party selected Robert Atkinson, who had fought the 1997 election and was a local councillor. The Liberal Democrats also renominated their general election candidate, Robert Woodthorpe Browne. Because of the prominence of the by-election in central London and the big political name, there were a wide variety of fringe and minor party candidates. Polling day was 25 November. Portillo was returned safely to Parliament.

<text>Tsai Ming-liang (; born 27 October 1957) is a Malaysian filmmaker based in Taiwan. Tsai has written and directed 11 feature films, many short films, and television films. He is one of the most celebrated &quot;Second New Wave&quot; film directors of Taiwanese cinema. His films have been acclaimed worldwide and have won numerous awards at festivals. In 1994, Tsai won the Golden Lion at the 51st Venice International Film Festival for the film &quot;Vive L&#x27;Amour&quot;.

==Early life==
Tsai was born in Malaysia, is of Chinese descent and spent his first 20 years in Kuching, Sarawak, after which he moved to Taipei, Taiwan. This, he said, had &quot;a huge impact on [his] mind and psyche&quot;. &quot;Even today&quot;, Tsai has said, &quot;I feel I belong neither to Taiwan nor to Malaysia. In a sense, I can go anywhere I want and fit in, but I never feel that sense of belonging.&quot;

Tsai graduated from the Drama and Cinema Department of the Chinese Culture University of Taiwan in 1982 and worked as a theatrical producer, screenwriter, and television director in Hong Kong. From 1989 to 1991, he directed several telefilms. One of these, &quot;Boys&quot;, starred his muse, Lee Kang-sheng.

==Career==
===1992–1998===
Tsai&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;Rebels of the Neon God&quot; (1992). A film about troubled youth in Taipei, it starred Lee as the character Hsiao-Kang. Lee went on to appear in all of Tsai&#x27;s feature films as of 2023. Tsai&#x27;s second feature, &quot;Vive L&#x27;Amour&quot; (1994), is about three people who unknowingly share an apartment. The film is slow-paced, has little dialogue, and is about alienation; all of these became Tsai&#x27;s trademarks. &quot;Vive L&#x27;Amour&quot; was critically acclaimed and won the Golden Horse Awards for best picture and best director.

Tsai&#x27;s next film was &quot;The River&quot; (1997), in which a family has to deal with the son&#x27;s neck pain. The family is similar to one that appears in &quot;Rebels of the Neon God&quot; and is played by the same three actors. &quot;The Hole&quot; (1998) is about two neighbors in an apartment. It features several musical numbers.

===1999–2009===
In Tsai&#x27;s next film, &quot;What Time Is It There?&quot; (2001), a man and a woman meet in Taipei before the woman travels to Paris. This was Tsai&#x27;s first film to star Chen Shiang-chyi, who starred in his next few films alongside Lee. &quot;Goodbye, Dragon Inn&quot; (2003) is about people inside an old cinema that is closing down. For this film, Tsai included even longer shots and fewer lines of dialogue than in previous films, a trend that continued in his later work. &quot;The Wayward Cloud&quot; (2005) is a sequel to &quot;What Time Is It There?&quot; in which Hsiao-Kang and Shiang-chyi meet again and start a relationship while Hsiao-Kang works as a pornographic film actor. This film, like &quot;The Hole&quot;, features several musical numbers.

Tsai&#x27;s next film, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Sleep Alone&quot; (2006), was his first set in Malaysia and is about two different characters, both played by Lee. In 2007, the Malaysian Censorship Board banned the film based on incidents shown depicting the country &quot;in a bad light&quot; for cultural, ethical, and racial reasons, but later allowed it to be screened in the country after Tsai agreed to censor parts of the film according to the board&#x27;s requirements. Tsai&#x27;s next film, &quot;Face&quot; (2009), is about a Taiwanese director who travels to France to shoot a film.

===2010–present===

Tsai&#x27;s next feature film was &quot;Stray Dogs&quot; (2013), about a homeless family.

Most of Tsai&#x27;s output in the 2010s was dedicated to his exhibition films, in particular the &quot;Walker&quot; series (2012–24), the subject of which was a monk played by Lee who travels by walking slowly, usually surrounded by a busy background.

In 2020, Tsai released &quot;Days&quot;, which competed for the Golden Bear at the Berlinale film festival.

In 2021, Tsai released &quot;Wandering&quot;, a short installation film with no dialogue, which follows a woman visiting an exhibition of Tsai&#x27;s &quot;Walker&quot; series in Taiwan.

In December 2024, Tsai is scheduled to make his Australian in-person debut at an &quot;In Conversation&quot; event at the Australian Cinémathèque, Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Brisbane. This event coincides with a special retrospective of Tsai&#x27;s work as part of QAGOMA&#x27;s Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art.

===Honours===
Tsai&#x27;s honours include a Golden Lion (best picture) for &quot;Vive L&#x27;Amour&quot; at the 51st Venice International Film Festival; the Silver Bear – Special Jury Prize for &quot;The River&quot; at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival; the FIPRESCI award for &quot;The Hole&quot; at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival; and the Alfred Bauer Prize and Silver Bear for Outstanding Artistic Achievement for &quot;The Wayward Cloud&quot; at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival; the Grand Jury Prize at the 70th Venice International Film Festival for &quot;Stray Dogs&quot;. In 1995, he was a member of the jury at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2003, &quot;The Guardian&quot; voted Tsai No. 18 of the 40 best directors in the world. In 2014, he was named an officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by the government of France.

==Personal life==
Tsai is gay and has incorporated queer themes into his films. Since 2021, he has lived in the mountains near Taipei, where he renovates and lives in abandoned apartments. He shares his living spaces with his long-term collaborator, Lee Kang-sheng, in a platonic relationship.

<doc id="850579" wikidata="Q780716" url="?curid=850579" title="Social exchange theory">
<text>Social exchange theory is a sociological and psychological theory that studies the social behavior in the interaction of two parties that implement a cost-benefit analysis to determine risks and benefits. The theory also involves economic relationships—the cost-benefit analysis occurs when each party has goods that the other parties value. Social exchange theory suggests that these calculations occur in a variety of relationships, from romantic relationships and friendships to professional relationships, and even in ephemeral interactions, such as exchanging words with a customer at the cash register. Social exchange theory says that if the costs of the relationship are higher than the rewards, such as if a lot of effort or money were put into a relationship and not reciprocated, then the relationship may be terminated or abandoned.

The most comprehensive social exchange theories are those of the American social psychologists John W. Thibaut (1917–1986) and Harold H. Kelley (1921–2003), the American sociologists George C. Homans (1910–1989), Peter M. Blau (1918–2002), Richard Marc Emerson (d. 1982), and Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908–2009). Homans defined social exchange as the exchange of activity, tangible or intangible, and more or less rewarding or costing between at least two persons. After Homans founded the theory, other theorists continued to write about it, particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson, who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology. Homans&#x27; work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another. Although there are various modes of exchange, Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange. John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts, the dyad and small group. Lévi-Strauss is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange.

== Thibaut and Kelley ==
Thibaut and Kelley based their theory on small groups related with dyadic relationships. They used the reward-cost matrices from game theory and discovered some clues of individuals&#x27; interdependence such as the power of a party over each other, also known as the &quot;correspondence&quot; versus &quot;noncorrespondence&quot; of outcomes. Additionally, they suggest that an individual can unilaterally affect her or his own outcomes in a relationship through chosen behaviors. They could predict the possible course of a social interaction through the analysis of aspects of power in an encounter. They also experimented on how the outcomes received in a relationship could define a person&#x27;s attractions to relationships.

== Homans ==
Homans based his theory on concepts of equilibration, expectancy and distributive justice in dyadic exchange. With this, he tries to explain the social interaction in small groups and the rewards received proportional to their costs and investments. Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation–satiation proposition, described below.

#Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action.
#Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it.
#Deprivation–satiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes.

== Blau ==
Blau&#x27;s theory is very similar to Homans&#x27;. However, he uses more economics terms and it is based principally on emergent social structure in social exchange patterns in small groups. His theory analyzes the development of exchange theory in economics without emphasizing on the psychological assumptions. He contributed to the idea of distinguishing between social and economic exchanges and exchange and power. The goal of his theory was to identify complex and simple processes without ignoring emergent properties. Blau&#x27;s utilitarian focus encouraged the theorist to look forward, as in what they anticipated the reward would be in regards to their next social interaction. Blau felt that if individuals focused too much on the psychological concepts within the theory, they would refrain from learning the developing aspects of social exchange. Blau emphasized technical economic analysis whereas Homans concentrated more on the psychology of instrumental behavior.

== Emerson ==
Emerson was inspired by Homans and Blau&#x27;s ideas. He focused on the interaction and relationship between individuals and parties. His view of social exchange theory emphasizes the resource availability, power, and dependence as primary dynamics.  He thought that relations were organized in different manners, and they could differ depending on the type and amount of the resources exchanged. He poses the idea that power and dependence are the main aspects that define a relationship. According to Emerson, Exchange is not a theory, but a framework from which other theories can converge and be compared to structural functionalism. Emerson&#x27;s perspective was similar to Blau&#x27;s since they both focused on the relationship power had with the exchange process. Emerson says that social exchange theory is an approach in sociology that is described for simplicity as an economic analysis of noneconomic social situations. Exchange theory brings a quasi-economic form of analysis into those situations.

== Lévi-Strauss ==
Strauss was a social exchange theorist in the context of anthropology. He is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange. He based his kinship systems on Mauss&#x27;s investigation. As it works in the form of indirect reciprocities, Levi-Strauss suggested the concept of generalized exchange.

==Self-interest and interdependence==
Self-interest and interdependence are central properties of social exchange. These are the basic forms of interaction when two or more actors have something of value to each other, and they have to decide whether to exchange and in what amounts. Homans uses the concepts of individualism to explain exchange processes. To him, the meaning of individual self-interest is a combination of economic and psychological needs. Fulfilling self-interest is often common within the economic realm of the social exchange theory where competition and greed can be common. In social exchange, self-interest is not a negative thing; rather, when self-interest is recognized, it will act as the guiding force of interpersonal relationships for the advancement of both parties&#x27; self-interest&quot;—Michael Roloff (1981)
Thibaut and Kelley see the mutual interdependence of persons as the central problem for the study of social behavior. They developed a theoretical framework based on the interdependence of actors. They also highlighted social implications of different forms of interdependence such as reciprocal control. According to their interdependence definition, outcomes are based on a combination of parties&#x27; efforts and mutual and complementary arrangements.

==Basic concepts==
Social exchange theory views exchange as a social behavior that may result both in economic and social outcomes. Social exchange theory has been generally analyzed by comparing human interactions with the marketplace. The study of the theory from the microeconomics perspective is attributed to Blau. Under his perspective every individual is trying to maximize his wins. Blau stated that once this concept is understood, it is possible to observe social exchanges everywhere, not only in market relations, but also in other social relations like friendship. Social exchange process brings satisfaction when people receive fair returns for their expenditures. The major difference between social and economic exchange is the nature of the exchange between parties. Neoclassic economic theory views the actor as dealing not with another actor but with a market and environmental parameters, such as market price. Unlike economic exchange, the elements of social exchange are quite varied and cannot be reduced to a single quantitative exchange rate. According to Stafford, social exchanges involve a connection with another person; involve trust and not legal obligations; are more flexible; and rarely involve explicit bargaining.

===Cost and rewards===
Simple social exchange models assume that rewards and costs drive relationship decisions. Both parties in a social exchange take responsibility for one another and depend on each other. The elements of relational life include:

Costs are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner. (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.)

Rewards are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.)

As with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides.

If worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability.
Homans based his theory on behaviorism to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs. The &quot;satisfactory-ness&quot; of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party.

=== Reciprocity norm ===
Summarized by Gouldner, the reciprocity norm states that a benefit should be returned and the one who gives the benefit should not be harmed. This is used to stabilize relationships and to identify egoism. This norm suggests independence in relationships and invite the individual to consider more than one&#x27;s self-interest.

=== Social penetration theory ===

Altman and D. Taylor introduced social penetration theory, which studies the nature and quality of social exchange and close bonds. It suggests that once the individuals start to give more of their resources to one another, relationships evolve progressively from exchanging superficial goods to other, more meaningful exchanges. It progresses to the point called &quot;self-disclosure&quot;, where the individuals share innermost thoughts and feelings with one another.

=== Equity and inequity ===
In this process, the individuals will compare their rewards with others&#x27; in relation to their costs. Equity can be defined as the balance between a person&#x27;s inputs and outcomes on the job. Some examples of inputs can be qualifications, promotions, interest on the job and how hard one works. Some outcomes can be pay, fringe benefits, and power status. The individual will mainly expect an equitable input-outcome ratio. Inequity happens when the individual perceives an unbalanced ratio of their outcomes and other&#x27;s outcomes. This can occur in a direct exchange of the two parties, or there can be a third party involved. An individual&#x27;s point of view of equity or inequity can differ depending on the individual.

== Aging ==
The basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiating exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person&#x27;s life course through the various relationships, opportunities, and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages, these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur. It also changes through the directionality of support given to and by the individual with the people within their support network. Within this model, there are different types of support (social support) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual.

==Theoretical propositions==

Ivan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory.
# Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs.
# Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long-term outcomes.
# Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes.
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval).
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy.
# Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes.
# Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one&#x27;s desirability in the social marketplace.)
# In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures.

In his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship. A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefore act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds.

===Homans===
Even though Homans took an individualistic approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange. By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized. According to Homans, social structures emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances.

Homans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals&#x27; behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans&#x27;s version of social exchange theory.
*The first proposition: the success proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated.
* The second proposition: the stimulus proposition believes that if an individual&#x27;s behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior.
*The third proposition: the value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur.
*The fourth proposition: the deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish.
*The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations. Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly.

=== Frazer ===
Based on economics, Frazer&#x27;s theory about social exchange emphasizes the importance of power and status differentiations in social exchange. Frazer&#x27;s theory had a particular interest in the cross-cousin marriage.

=== Malinowski ===
With his Kula exchange, Malinowski drew a sharp differentiation between economic exchange and social exchange. Using his Kula exchange, Malinowski states that the motives of exchange can be mainly social and psychological.

=== Mauss ===
Mauss&#x27;s theory tries to identify the role played by morality and religion in the social exchange. Mauss argues the exchange found in the society is influenced by social behaviors, while morality and religion influence all aspects of life.

=== Bohannan ===
Bohannan focuses his theory on economic problems such as multicentrism, and modes of exchange. He contributed to the social exchange theory finding the role and function of markets in tribal subsistence economies, makes a distinction of economic redistribution and market exchange from social relationships.

=== Polanyi ===
He proposes three principles to create a new idea for socioeconomic change, transforming traditional economies, and political economic development. These principles are: reciprocity, redistribution and marketing.

=== Sahlins ===
He presents the idea that the economy is a category of behavior instead of just a simple category of culture.

==Assumptions==
Social exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support. All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories. 

The assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following:

*Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments.
*Humans are rational beings.
*The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person.

The assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following:

*Relationships are interdependent.
*Relational life is a process.

Social systems result from human activity and function as structures designed to organize, guide, and regulate human affairs. However, variations exist in how costs and benefits are weighed depending on the actors involved, as well as in the interpretation, adoption, enforcement, neglect, and application of norms and sanctions.

Furthermore, regarding human nature, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly. All relationships involve exchanges, and the balance of these exchanges is considered fair when they are equitable.

==Comparison levels==
Social exchange includes &quot;both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other&quot;. John Thibaut and Harold Kelley proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: comparison level and comparison level for alternative. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the comparison level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual&#x27;s comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual. The comparison level for alternative (CLalt) refers to &quot;the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone&quot;. In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange. CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay.

==Modes of exchange==
According to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in behavioral sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are rational. When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: &quot;It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends&quot;. The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other&#x27;s actions. The process begins when at least one participant makes a &quot;move&quot;, and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies.

===Power dependence relations===
Several definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange. However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson, who developed a theory of power-dependence relations. According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power. Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another. Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use. Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.

According to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner&#x27;s outcomes. Behavior control is the power to cause another&#x27;s behavior to change by changing one&#x27;s own behavior.

===Matrices===
People develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power. These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix.

*The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors (the specific skills each interactant possesses).
*The effective matrix &quot;which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange&quot;
*The dispositional matrix represents the way two people believe that rewards ought to be exchanged between them.

There are three forms within these matrices: Reciprocity, Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity:
#Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges
#Reciprocity as a folk belief
#Reciprocity as a moral norm

A generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals. For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously.

Another common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement. Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty. An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges. Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement.

==Critiques==

Katherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works
*The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory.
*The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn&#x27;t the best option in a relationship.
*The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case.
*The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy.

Russell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules. Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as altruism, group gain, status consistency and competition. Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry).

Rosenfeld (2005) has noted significant limitations to Social Exchange Theory and its application in the selection of mates/partners. Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange moot.

==Applications==
The most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships. However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources. Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating:

:Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum (&quot;Theories Used in Research&quot;).

===Anthropology===
Other applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of anthropology as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and norms. Lévi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered. Lévi–Strauss uses a collectivist approach to explain exchanges. To Lévi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms. This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process. Lévi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups.

===Relationships===
Throughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study applied this theory to new media (online dating). The study discovers the different factors involved when an individual decides to establish an online relationship. Overall the study followed the social exchange theory&#x27;s idea, &quot;people are attracted to those who grant them rewards&quot;.

Another example is Berg&#x27;s study about development of friendship between roommates. The research found how social exchange processes changed during the year by measuring self disclosure. According to the study, the amount one person rewards another and the comparison levels for alternatives become the most important factors in determining liking and satisfaction. Auld, C. and Alan C. conducted a study to discover what processes occur and what is experienced during social leisure relationships. They use the concept of reciprocity to understand their findings. The study concluded that meeting new people is often given as a major reason for participation in leisure activities, and meeting new people may be conceptualized as an exercise of reciprocity. In this case, reciprocity is perceived as a starting mechanism for new social relationships because people are willing to be helped by others, expecting that the help will eventually be returned. A study conducted by Paul, G., called Exchange and access in field work tries to understand the relationships between the researchers and subjects. This study concludes that Bargaining helps to satisfy the more specific needs of the parties because greater risks are taken to obtain more information. This study also introduces the concept of trust (social sciences) to determine the duration of relationships.

===Interracial marriage===
Patterns of interracial marriage have been explained using social exchange theory. Kalmijn suggests that ethnic status is offset against educational or financial resources. This process has been used to explain why there are more marriages between black men and white women than between white men and black women. This asymmetry in marriage patterns has been used to support the idea of a racial hierarchy. Lewis, however, explains that the same patterns of marriage can be accounted for in terms of simple facial attractiveness patterns of the different gender by race groupings. Recent changes have seen an increase in black women marrying white men and a decrease in raw prevalence of interracial marriages when it comes to black women. There has also been a shift in the concentration of interracial marriage from mostly being between those with low education levels to those with higher levels of education.

===Business===
Social exchange theory has served as a theoretical foundation to explain different situations in business practices. It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships, supply network relationships, and relationship marketing. The investment model proposed by Caryl Rusbult is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer&#x27;s own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost. When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they devote additional resources to the relationship to salvage their initial investment.

Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange. According to a study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman, firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determining whether their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve. Holmen and Pedersen note that social exchange theory has contributed to the understanding of &quot;connected&quot; business relationships between firms.

===Work settings===
A study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles. 

Another more recent study by M. van Houten which took place in institutions for vocational education shows how, in social exchange relationships between teachers, reciprocity and feelings of ownership, affection and interpersonal safety impact on individual professionals´ decisions on what to share with whom. Colleagues who never ´pay back´ and make actual exchange happen (that is, who consume rather than produce and share), risk being left out. The study also points out the possibility of ´negative rewards´: exchange of one&#x27;s knowledge, materials or otherwise may enable someone else the misuse that what was shared and/or take credit somewhere in the team or organisation. As such, interpersonal relationships and ´fair´ exchange appear important, as does some kind of mechanism for rewards and gratitude (possibly organisation-wide), as these impact on individual professional discretion and the degree and success of exchange. 

===Citizenship behavior===
Social exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for organizational citizenship behavior. This study examines a model of clear leadership and relational building between head and teachers as antecedents, and organizational citizenship behavior as a consequence of teacher–school exchange. Citizenship behavior can also be shown with employees and their employers.This is shown through organizational identification which plays an important role in organizational citizenship behavior. An employee&#x27;s identification with their employer plays a significant role in supporting and promoting organized citizenship behavior, serving as a mediating mechanism with citizenship behaviors, perceived organizational justice, and organizational support based on both the social exchange and social identity theory.

===Online social networking and self-disclosure===
Understanding interpersonal disclosure in online social networking is an ideal application of social networking theory. Researchers have leveraged SET to explain self-disclosure in a cross-cultural context of French and British working professionals. They discover that reciprocation is the primary benefit of self-disclosure, whereas risk is the foundational cost of self-disclosure. They find that positive social influence to use an online community increases online community self-disclosure; reciprocity increases self-disclosure; online community trust increases self-disclosure; and privacy risk beliefs decrease self-disclosure. Meanwhile, a tendency toward collectivism increases self-disclosure. Similar research also leveraged SET to examine privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self-disclosure technologies in the context of instant messaging. This study was also a cross-cultural study, but instead compared US and Chinese participants.

==Affect theory==

The actors in social exchange are normally viewed as unemotional beings who have information, cognitively process it, and make decisions concerning the pattern and nature of exchange with others. Affect theory of social exchange complements social exchange theory by incorporating emotion as part of the exchange process. Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks). These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship.

===Assumptions===

Most social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward. The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and affect theory:

*There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange.
*Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative
*Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value).
*Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange.
*Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them.
*Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity.

===Theoretical propositions===

Affect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims:

Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses

Individuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful. These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions.

Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions

Individuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange.

The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced

The mode of exchange (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.

The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups

The different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual&#x27;s attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange. Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between.

One condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any self-serving biases and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self.

Lawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. Following Weiner (1985) affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment.

Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties

Repeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.

<text>According to Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah or Oral Law () are statutes and legal interpretations that were not recorded in the Five Books of Moses, the Written Torah (), and which are regarded by Orthodox Jews as prescriptive and given at the same time. This holistic Jewish code of conduct encompasses a wide swathe of rituals, worship practices, Godman and interpersonal relationships, from dietary laws to Sabbath and festival observance to marital relations, agricultural practices, and civil claims and damages.

According to Rabbinic Jewish tradition, the Oral Torah was passed down orally in an unbroken chain from generation to generation until its contents were finally committed to writing following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, when Jewish civilization was faced with an existential threat, by virtue of the dispersion of the Jewish people.

The major repositories of the Oral Torah are the &quot;Mishnah&quot;, compiled between 200–220 CE by Judah ha-Nasi, and the &quot;Gemara&quot;, a series of running commentaries and debates concerning the Mishnah, which together form the &quot;Talmud&quot;, the preeminent text of Rabbinic Judaism. In fact, two &quot;versions&quot; of the Talmud exist: one produced in the Galilee 300–350 CE (the Jerusalem Talmud), and a second, more extensive Talmud compiled in Jewish Babylonia 450–500 CE (the Babylonian Talmud).

Belief that at least portions of the Oral Torah were transmitted orally from God to Moses on Biblical Mount Sinai during the Exodus from Egypt is a fundamental tenet of faith of Orthodox Judaism, and was recognized as one of the Thirteen Principles of Faith by Maimonides.

There have also been historical dissenters to the Oral Torah, most notably the Sadducees and Karaites, who claimed to derive their religious practice only from the Written Torah. The Beta Israel, isolated from the rest of world Jewry for many centuries, also lacked Rabbinic texts until they made Aliyah in mass in recent years.

==Components of the Oral Torah==
The term &quot;Oral Torah&quot; should not be understood as a monolith. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; divides the Oral Torah into eight categories, ranked according to the relative level of authoritativeness, which are found within the Talmud, the Tosefta and the halakhic Midrashim.
# Explanations of those laws of the written law, which are not fully intelligible without the explanations, and therefore presuppose an oral interpretation. Such explanations are connected in some way with Scripture.
# Ancient halakhot which have no connection with Scripture and can not be connected with it, thus deriving their authority only from the tradition which ascribes them to Moses on Sinai. (In the case of these two groups, it is impossible to ascertain which elucidations and rules were really given to Moses on Sinai, and which were added later.)
# Laws found in the prophetic books. Some of these originated at the time of the Prophets; but others are much older, perhaps having been transmitted orally, and committed to writing by the Prophets. They are called also &quot;Dibre Ḳabbalah&quot; (Words of Tradition).
# Interpretations and regulations defining many written laws, as well as new laws, formulated by the early scribes, beginning with the time of Ezra. These are called also &quot;Dibre Soferim&quot; (Words of the Scribes).
# Interpretations and regulations covering the written law, as well as new halakhot, which the Tannaim deduced from Scripture by means of hermeneutic rules or by logical conclusions. There are differences of opinion among the scholars in regard to most of these explanations and definitions; but they are of equal weight with the written law, and are called also &quot;Debar Torah&quot; (Regulation of the Torah).
# Customs and observances (&quot;taḳḳanot&quot;) which were introduced at various times by different scholars. They are ascribed partly to Moses, partly to Joshua, but chiefly to the members of the Great Synagogue or the &quot;Soferim &quot;(&quot;Scribes&quot;), and are called also &quot;Dibre Soferim&quot; (&quot;Words of the Scribes&quot;).
# Statutes and decisions (&quot;gezerot&quot;) decreed by the Sanhedrin or court, and generally accepted. Such laws could be abrogated only by another court greater than the first one in numbers and scholarship.
# Statutes and regulations for which the scholars had no tradition or allusion in Scripture, but which they accepted as standards after deriving them from the customs and laws of the country in which they were living. These are called &quot;Hilkhot Medinah&quot; (Statutes of the Country).

The laws in the last three groups were not considered equal in validity to the written law (&quot;De&#x27;oraita&quot;), but were regarded merely as rabbinical regulations (&quot;de-rabbanan&quot;).

==Historical development==

===Source and transmission===

According to modern scholarship, the traditions embodied in what later became known as the &quot;Oral Torah&quot; developed over generations among the inhabitants of Judea and Israel and were passed down through various modes of cultural transmission, including but not restricted to oral transmission. It is hypothesized that, sometime prior to the Babylonian exile of 586–530 BCE, in applying the Mosaic code to daily life and Temple worship, &quot;a multitude of usages arising out of practical necessity or convenience or experience became part of the routine of observance of the code, and, in the course of time, shared the sanctity and authority which were inherent in the divinely inspired code itself.&quot;

Such practices experienced exponential growth from the time of Ezra to the Romans&#x27; destruction of the Second Temple due to the changing social and religious conditions experienced by inhabitants of Judea. Many of these practices were advocated by the Pharisees, a sect of largely lower- and middle-class Jews who stood in opposition to the Sadducees, the priestly caste who dominated the Temple cult. The Sadducees rejected the legitimacy of any extra-biblical law or tradition, as well as increasingly popular notions such as the immortality of the soul and divine intervention. Danby notes the following:
It is a reasonable hypothesis that a result of this controversy—a controversy which continued for two centuries—was a deliberate compilation and justification of the unwritten tradition by the Pharisean party, perhaps unsystematic and on a small scale in the earlier stages, but stimulated and fostered from time to time both by opposition from the Sadducees and by internal controversy (such as, e.g., the disputes between the Houses of Hillel and Shammai) within the ranks of the Pharisees, culminating in the collections of traditional laws (&quot;Halakoth&quot;) from which the present Mishnah draws its material.
With the destruction of the Second Temple around 70 CE, the Sadducees were divested of their main source of authority, without which their theology could not survive. On the other hand, the Pharisees became the progenitor of the rabbinic class, who formalized the traditions of their predecessors. Following the fall of the Temple, it appears that the Pharisaic leader Johanan ben Zakkai (30–90 CE) settled in Yavneh, where he established a school that came to be regarded by fellow Jews as the successors of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin. Upon this Council of Jabneh fell the duty of administering and interpreting religious law, conserving tradition, and solving problems that arose by the past dependence of numerous observances on the existence of the Temple and priesthood. Thus, from 70 to 130 CE, when the Bar Kochba revolt further decimated the Jewish community, the Oral Law experienced a significant period of development and an unprecedented level of legal and religious authority among the populace.

===Codification===

====The Mishnah====
The destruction of the Second Temple and the fall of Jerusalem in the first and early second centuries CE devastated the Jewish community. The First Jewish–Roman War of 66–73 CE and the Bar Kokhba revolt cost hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives, the destruction of leading yeshivot, and thousands of scholars and students. At that point, it became apparent that the Hebrew community and its learning were threatened, and that publication was the only way to ensure that the law could be preserved. Thus, around 200 CE, a redaction of the Oral Law in writing was completed. Both Rabbinic tradition and scholarship ascribe this effort to Judah HaNasi. The product of this effort, the Mishnah, is generally considered the first work of rabbinic literature.

&quot;Mishnah&quot; is the name given to the 63 tractates that HaNasi systematically codified, which in turn are divided into six &quot;orders.&quot; Unlike the Torah, in which, for example, laws of the Sabbath are scattered throughout the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, all the Mishnaic laws of the Sabbath are located in a single tractate called &quot;Shabbat&quot;. Moreover, the laws contained in the 24 chapters that make up that tractate are far more extensive than those contained in the Torah, reflecting the extensiveness of the Oral Law. Some authority suggests HaNasi made use of as many as 13 separate collections of Halakhot from different schools and time periods, and reassembled that material into a coherent whole, arranged it systematically, summarized discussions, and in some cases rendered his own rulings where alternative traditions existed.

The Mishnah does far more than expound upon and organize the Biblical commandments. Rather, important topics covered by the Mishnah &quot;rest on no scriptural foundations whatsoever,&quot; such as portions of the civil law tractates of &quot;Bava Kamma&quot;, &quot;Bava Metzia&quot; and &quot;Bava Batra&quot;. In other words, &quot;To perfect the [Written] Torah, the Oral tradition had to provide for a variety of transactions left without any law at all in Scripture.&quot; Just as portions of the Torah reflect (according to the documentary hypothesis) the agenda of the Levite priesthood in centralizing worship in the Temple in Jerusalem and legitimizing their exclusive authority over the sacrificial cult, so too can the Mishnah be seen as reflecting the unique &quot;program&quot; of the Tannaim and their successors to develop an egalitarian form of Judaism with an emphasis on social justice and an applicability throughout the Jewish diaspora. As a result, the Talmud often finds the rabbis combing scripture for textual support to justify existing religious practice, rather than deriving the practice organically from the language of scripture.

====The Gemara====
HaNasi&#x27;s method of codification, in which he often included minority viewpoints and citation by name to rabbis who championed different viewpoints, became a template for the Gemara, a compendium of discussions and commentaries on the Mishnah&#x27;s laws by generations of leading rabbis during the next four centuries in the two centers of Jewish life, Syria Palaestina or &quot;Judea&quot; and Asoristan or &quot;Babylonia&quot;. The Gemara with the Mishnah came to be edited together into compilations known as the Talmud. Both the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud have been transmitted in written form to the present day, although the more extensive Babylonian Talmud is widely considered to be more authoritative.

The Talmud&#x27;s discussions follow the order of the Mishnah, although not all tractates are discussed. Generally, a law from the Mishnah is cited, which is followed by a rabbinic deliberation on its meaning. The discussion often, but not always, results in a decision regarding the more persuasive or authoritative position based on available sources or anecdotal evidence. (See &quot;Aliba dehilchasa&quot;.)

==In Jewish tradition==

===Rabbinic thought===
Rabbinic tradition considers the Oral Law to be of divine origin. The divinity and authoritativeness of the Oral Law as transmitted from God to Moses on Mount Sinai, continues to be accepted by Orthodox and Haredi Judaism as a fundamental precept of Judaism. The Oral Law was the basis for nearly all subsequent rabbinic literature. It is therefore intricately related to the development of Halacha. As such, despite codification, interpretation of the Oral Law is likewise required.

====Divine source and transmission====
Rabbis of the Talmudic era conceived of the Oral Torah in two distinct ways. First, Rabbinic tradition saw the Oral Torah as an unbroken chain of transmission. The distinctive feature of this view was that Oral Torah was &quot;conveyed by word of mouth and memorized.&quot; Second, the Rabbis also viewed the Oral Torah as an interpretive tradition, and not merely as memorized traditions. They saw the written Torah as containing many levels of interpretation. It was left to later generations, who were steeped in the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of interpretation, to discover those (&quot;hidden&quot;) interpretations not revealed by Moses. Instead, Moses was obligated to impart the explanations orally to students, children, and fellow adults. It was thus forbidden to write and publish the Oral Torah; some rabbis kept private notes of their teaching, but only for their personal convenience.

Jewish tradition identifies the unbroken historical chain of individuals who were entrusted with passing down the Oral Law from Moses to the early rabbinic period: &quot;Moses received the Torah and handed it down to Joshua; Joshua to the Elders; the Elders to the prophets; and the prophets handed it down to the men of the Great Assembly.&quot; Similarly, Maimonides provides a generation by generation account of the names of all those in the direct line that transmitted this tradition, beginning with Moses up until Ravina and Rav Ashi, the rabbis who compiled the Babylonian Talmud. The pivotal role of Akiva ben Yosef is discussed in a Talmudic story, when Moses sees Rabbi Akiva (Menachot 29b), which portrays God as preparing the Torah for Akiva&#x27;s interpretive skills in midrash.

====The interplay of the Oral and Written Law====

Rabbinic tradition identifies several characteristics of the Written Law, suggesting the existence of a parallel Oral tradition. 

Here, the Oral Law must have been disseminated at the same time as the Written Torah because certain Torah commandments would be indecipherable without a separate explanatory codex (and, presumably, God would not demand adherence to commandments that could not be understood). 
Many terms used in the Torah are left undefined, such as the word &quot;totafot&quot;, usually translated as &quot;frontlets,&quot; which is used three times in the Pentateuch (in Exodus 13:9 and Deuteronomy 6:8 and 11:18) but only identified with tefillin in the Mishnah (see Menachot 3:7).

Similarly, many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions, or assume familiarity on the part of the reader. For example, the discussion of &quot;shechita&quot; (kosher slaughter) in Deuteronomy 12 states &quot;you shall kill of your herd and of your flock which God Lord has given you, &quot;as I have commanded you&quot;,&quot; without any clear indication of what had been &quot;commanded&quot;; only in the Oral Torah are the various requirements of ritual slaughter explicated. Similarly, Deuteronomy 24 discusses the laws of divorce in passing; these laws are set forth with great specificity in the Mishnah and Gemara. Another example: the blue string of tekhelet on the tzitzit is to be dyed with an extraction from what scholars believe to be a snail; a detail only spoken of in the oral Torah. For other examples and further discussion here see &quot;Kuzari&quot; 3:35.

Moreover, according to the rabbinic view, without an Oral Law, blind adherence to the plain text of certain Torah commandments would cause the practitioner to violate a commandment elsewhere in the Torah or could lead to unethical acts, and thus, &quot;a priori&quot;, a set of supplementary &quot;instructions&quot; must have been provided. A classic example involves the phrase &quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot&quot; is held in the oral tradition to imply monetary compensation – as opposed to a literal &quot;Lex talionis&quot;. Note also that the interpretation as &quot;monetary compensation&quot; is borne out by , implying that &quot;only&quot; in the case of murder is &quot;Lex talionis&quot; applied (per logic of following paragraph).

The Oral Torah is similarly needed to explain commandments - as well as actions of biblical actors - seemingly discordant with other verses. For example, the marriage of Boaz to Ruth () appears on its face to contradict the prohibition of against marrying Moabites (); however, the Oral Torah explains that this prohibition is limited to Moabite &quot;men&quot;. Similarly, the rabbinic practice for the Counting of the Omer () is at odds with the Karaite practice, which appears to accord with a more literal reading of these verses, but is in fact borne out by . 

Re the preceding paragraph, note that much Talmudic analysis demonstrates how the Mishnah&#x27;s rulings, and / or disputes, in fact derive from — and are hence consistent with — the much earlier Biblical texts; see .
Relatedly, the 1st century Targum Onkelos is largely consistent with the oral tradition as recorded in the midrash, redacted into writing only in the 3rd or 4th century. 

Complementary to the above textual and internal evidence, archaeologists have uncovered also physical evidence relating to religious rituals and practices which were current prior to the codification of the Mishnah; from which, it can be inferred that Judah HaNasi and his contemporaries recorded, rather than innovated, normative Judaism as practiced during the 1st century CE and prior. For example, excavations at Qumran (Cave 4) have yielded specimens of &quot;tefillin&quot; and parchment scrolls which reflect later Talmudic discussion. Likewise, the structure and placement of ritual baths at Masada appears to be consistent with the rabbinic requirements per the Mishnaic tractate &quot;Mikvaot&quot;, although they were constructed approximately 120 years before the Mishnah was compiled. A clay seal discovered in Jerusalem in 2011 is consistent with the tradition recorded in tractate &quot;Shekalim&quot; chapter 5. The Elephantine papyri include a &quot;Passover letter&quot; (419 BCE) which already included many of the Pesach observances of today, and the first known text of a Ketubah (about 440 BCE). The Qumran &quot;Halachic Letter&quot;, which records approximately a dozen disputes regarding the application of halakha, also testifies to the evolutionary process of the Oral Law.

====In rabbinic literature and commentary====
The Oral Law&#x27;s fundamental connection to the written Law, as evident in its initial &quot;recording&quot; in the Midrash and Talmud, is reflected in subsequent rabbinic works - particularly those discussed below - which draw on and reinforce this relationship.
Here, the midrash provides a verse-by-verse discussion of the entire Tanakh, thereby recording both aggadic and halakhic tradition.
Similarly, the Talmud reports in detail (mainly legal) discussion and analyses of the written Torah. (Although the discussion does not proceed verse-wise as with the Midrash - the structure is provided by the Mishnah - it is linked to the relevant verse(s) in almost all cases.)
Early Rabbinic literature builds on these works, where - reflecting the relationship as outlined - discussion of the Written Law is in light of the Oral Law.
The era of the &quot;Rishonim&quot; sees the Oral Law incorporated into the first formal Torah commentaries, where the biblical text is discussed and / or analysed based on the various Midrashic and Talmudic traditions. The chief of these is perhaps Rashi&#x27;s commentary on Tanakh. This work clarifies the &quot;simple&quot; meaning of the text, by addressing questions implied by the wording or verse or paragraph structure, by drawing on the Midrashic, Talmudic and Aggadic literature. It has given rise to numerous counter- (e.g., Ramban) and super-commentaries (e.g., Mizrachi), all similarly drawing on the Oral Torah, and widely studied to this day (see &quot;Mikraot Gedolot&quot;, ).
In more recent &quot;Acharonic&quot; times,
several (Orthodox) commentaries have been produced, which, in some sense, &quot;reverse&quot; the direction of the analysis. These originated in response to the (erstwhile) challenges of &quot;haskalah&quot; and Biblical criticism, and were intended &quot;to demonstrate the indivisibility of the written Torah and its counterpart, the oral Torah&quot;, and in so doing, &quot;showing the organic relationship between the Written Law and the Oral Law&quot;, often in the light of the above. Given this purpose, these provide a further detailed and explicit analysis here. The main of these:
* &quot;Ha&#x27;amek Davar&quot; (&quot;Delve into the matter&quot;) on Torah, and &quot;Davar Ha&#x27;amek&quot; on &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; and &quot;Ketuvim&quot;, by Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, the &quot;Netziv&quot;
* &quot;Haketav VehaKabbalah&quot; (&quot;The Written [Torah] and the [Oral] Tradition&quot;) on Torah, by Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg
* &quot;HaTorah vehaMitzva&quot; (&quot;The Torah and the Commandment&quot;) by Meïr Leibush, the &quot;Malbim&quot;, covers all of &quot;Tanakh&quot; except &quot;Kohelet&quot; and &quot;Eicha&quot;.
* &quot;Uebersetzung und Erklärung des Pentateuchs&quot; (&quot;Translation and Commentary of the Pentateuch&quot;) by Samson Raphael Hirsch.
* &quot;Torah Temimah&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Torah&quot;) on Torah, by Baruch Epstein.

Contemporaneous with, and complementary to these commentaries, were specific, monograph-like works discussing the Oral Torah in concept and historically, as below.
These had been preceded by (if perhaps less modern in orientation) Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Introduction to the Mishnah&quot; — dealing with the nature of the Oral Law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah; and Isaiah Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the Oral Torah&quot; in part 2 of his &quot;Shenei Luchot HaBerit&quot;.
These works are:
*&quot;Dor Dor v&#x27;Dor&#x27;shav&quot; (&quot;Each generation and its Scholars&quot;), by Rabbi Isaac Hirsch Weiss, a five volume history of the Oral aw, Halakha and Aggada, from Biblical times until the composition of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.
*&quot;Mevo Hatalmud&quot; (&quot;Introduction to the Talmud&quot;) and &quot;Torat Neviim&quot; (&quot;Teachings of the Prophets&quot;), by Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes. The first, a detailed history and classification of the Talmud and its underlying oral tradition, formulating the nature, extent, and authority of tradition. The second, treatises on the authority of Talmudic tradition, and on the organic structure and methodology of the Talmud. 
*&quot;Die Erste Mishna&quot; (The First Mishna), a historical and linguistic analysis of the Mishna by David Zvi Hoffmann, positing an early, uniform, undisputed, and therefore authoritative collection of the Oral Law. (R. Hoffmann also authored a Torah commentary addressing some of the same issues as those mentioned.)
*&quot;Matteh Dan&quot; (or &quot;Kuzari Hasheini&quot;; London 1714) written by Rabbi David Nieto demonstrates the authority of the Oral Law, and defends the tradition against attacks by Karaites and skeptics.
*Several works by Rabbi Immanuel Aboab, especially his &quot;Nomologia&quot;, defend the traditional law and discuss its chronology.

Other major works discussing the Bible as based on the Oral Torah, and drawing on their interrelationship, include:
*&quot;El Conciliador&quot; (&quot;The Conciliator&quot;), by Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel, a work written to reconcile the apparent contradictions in numerous passages throughout the Bible by utilizing &quot;an astounding range of sources&quot;, primarily the Talmud and the classic Jewish commentaries. It was written in Spanish, in Amsterdam, 1632, primarily to strengthen the faith of the Marranos.
*Weiss&#x27; &quot;Dor Dor v&#x27;Dor&#x27;shav&quot; similarly discusses apparent divergencies in the Pentateuch and the various books of the Prophets.
*&quot;Me&#x27;am Lo&#x27;ez&quot;, begun by Rabbi Yaakov Culi in 1730, a detailed explanation of each chapter of the Torah, explaining it from &quot;countless approaches&quot;, especially according to the Midrash and Talmud; also discusses the relevant &quot;Halacha&quot; as based on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; and &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. The work was intended as a &quot;compendium&quot; of the major fields of Torah study, for the Ladino-speaking community.
*The recent &quot;Da&#x27;at Miqra&quot;, a voluminous Bible commentary combining a traditional outlook with the findings of modern research and archeology, and implicitly addressing biblical criticism. Here, see also , , and the work &quot;Da&#x27;at Sofrim&quot; by Chaim Dov Rabinowitz.

===Dissenting viewpoints===

From the Second Temple era, there has always been some level of opposition to the concept of a &quot;Dual Torah&quot; within the umbrella of Judaism, although today only the small Karaite sect formally opposes the incorporation of any extra-biblical law into their practice.

====Sadducees====
Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic oral traditions. They based their interpretations on their own traditions emphasizing a more literal understanding of the verses. In many respects, this led to a more severe observance than that of the Pharisees especially as regards purity laws and temple practice. Most aspects of Sadduceean law and methods of interpretation are not known.

====Essenes====
Essenes, a monastic group of people, had a &quot;monastic organization&quot;. Though they had non-biblical rules and customs, they differened significantly from the mainstream Rabbinic tradition.

====Samaritans====
The Samaritans, an ancient sect that has survived in small numbers to the present day, have their own rich interpretative tradition, as reflected in the Medieval Samaritan legal collection called the &quot;Hilukh&quot;, which shares etymological roots with the term &quot;Halakhah&quot;. However, the concept of a divinely ordained Oral Law having equal value with the written one is foreign to Samaritan theology.

====Karaites====

Karaite Judaism or Karaism is a Jewish denomination that began in eighth century Baghdad to form a separate sect that rejected of the Oral Torah and Talmud, and placed sole reliance on the Tanakh as scripture. Thus, for example, Karaites understood Exodus 35:3 (&quot;Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day&quot;) as forbidding the use of any kind of fire on the Sabbath, including fires lit before the start of the Sabbath, which are permitted by the Oral Law. Karaites also do not adhere to widespread customs such as the donning of &quot;tefillin&quot; and the prohibition against eating milk and meat together on the grounds that such practices are grounded in the Oral Law.

====The Reform Movement====
Influenced by the Haskalah, and under sociological pressure to assimilate to the Protestant and secular culture of European and North American urban elites, Reform Judaism came to reject the binding authority of the Oral Torah and systematically stripped its liturgy and practices of Rabbinic tradition.

===Modern perspectives===
====Torat Eretz Yisrael====
According to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, it is important to notice that Torah sages can err, just as the Sanhedrin could (Leviticus 4:13).

====Conservative Judaism====
Conservative Judaism (also known as &quot;Masorti&quot; outside North America) takes an intermediate approach between the Reform Movement and Orthodoxy, claiming that the Oral tradition is entitled to authority, but regarding its rulings as flexible guidelines rather than immutable precepts, that may be viewed through the lens of modernity. Jewish scholar and philosopher Ismar Schorsch has postulated that Conservative Judaism is tied to &quot;sensing divinity both in the Torah and in the Oral Law,&quot; but not in a literalist manner. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered intellectual founder of Conservative Judaism, was respected by many Orthodox until writing in 1859 that the Talmudic term &quot;Law given to Moses at Sinai&quot; always meant ancient customs accepted as such. His opponents demanded that he issue an unequivocal statement of belief in the total divinity of Oral Law, yet he refrained from doing so. He was consequently ostracized and declared a heretic by several authorities.

<doc id="850590" wikidata="Q6335657" url="?curid=850590" title="KPLR-TV">
<text>KPLR-TV (channel 11) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, serving as the local outlet for The CW. It is owned and operated by network majority owner Nexstar Media Group alongside Fox affiliate KTVI (channel 2). The two stations share studios on Ball Drive in Maryland Heights; KPLR&#x27;s transmitter is located in Sappington, Missouri.

==History==
===As an independent station===

The station first signed on the air on April 28, 1959, as the first independent station in Missouri. The station&#x27;s call letters were derived from the name of its founding owner, St. Louis real estate developer and hotelier Harold Koplar. Despite losing in his quest to build the station from the ground up, events effectively outside his control would allow him to acquire the license for the station in 1958.

CBS was originally granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build channel 11 in January 1957, prevailing over three other locally based competitors. But eight months later, CBS decided instead to purchase its existing St. Louis affiliate, KWK-TV (channel 4). As a condition of the channel 4 purchase, the FCC required CBS to relinquish the channel 11 license and construction permit. CBS did so by transferring it to the Koplar group, known as &quot;220 Television, Incorporated&quot;, for no financial consideration. Almost immediately, the three-way deal was held up after the St. Louis Amusement Company, one of the original applicants for channel 11, protested to the United States Court of Appeals in January 1958. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld the decision in November 1958, but CBS had already consummated its deal for channel 4 several months earlier, changing the station&#x27;s call letters to KMOX-TV – which were intended for channel 11 – and operated it for 28 years (it is now Gray Television-owned KMOV). Meanwhile, Koplar went to work building channel 11 on his own, no longer in the face of opposition.

KPLR originally operated from studios within the Koplar-owned Chase Park Plaza Hotel, located on Maryland Plaza in St. Louis&#x27; Central West End district. Channel 11 would move into a separate facility adjacent to the hotel several years later. Starting in the mid-1960s, Harold&#x27;s son Edward J. &quot;Ted&quot; Koplar began working behind the scenes at KPLR, producing sports programming and developing the station&#x27;s first regular local newscast. Ted Koplar became president and chief executive officer of channel 11 in 1979, and gained complete control of the station upon his father&#x27;s death in 1985.

For most of its existence, KPLR was a traditional independent station featuring cartoons, sitcoms, movies, drama series and locally produced newscasts. The station was also available on many cable systems in Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas as a regional superstation until the late 1980s. Locally, channel 11&#x27;s first and only competitor came in June 1969, when Evans Broadcasting launched KDNL-TV (channel 30). The Fox affiliation for the market went to KDNL when that network launched on October 9, 1986. While this was part of a larger affiliation deal with KDNL&#x27;s then-owner, Cox Broadcasting, most of the markets in KPLR&#x27;s cable footprint had enough stations by this point to provide a local Fox affiliate. This would have made the prospect of KPLR as a multi-state Fox affiliate unattractive to the Koplars in any event.

On January 17, 1994, the station began airing the Action Pack syndication block; the block&#x27;s inaugural broadcast, the made-for-TV movie &quot;TekWar&quot;, earned locally an 11.2 rating/16 share, a 129% increase over that same time period during November 1993.

In the summer of 1994, the station was approached by ABC to negotiate an affiliation agreement with the network to replace KTVI (channel 2) – which had been affiliated with ABC since it signed on as Belleville, Illinois–licensed WTVI on August 10, 1953 (when the station, then broadcasting on UHF channel 54, also maintained a primary CBS affiliation) – as its St. Louis affiliate. KTVI was among the thirteen &quot;Big Three&quot; network-affiliated television stations already owned or in the process of being acquired by New World Communications (and one of three out of the four stations that the group was acquiring from Argyle Television Holdings at the time) that were slated to switch to Fox under a long-term affiliation agreement announced between New World and then-Fox network parent News Corporation on May 23, 1994. Channel 11 station management would later turn the offer down; ABC instead reached an agreement with River City Broadcasting in August 1994 to shift the affiliation to outgoing Fox affiliate KDNL, which swapped network affiliations with KTVI on August 7, 1995.

===WB affiliation===
Upon that network&#x27;s launch, on January 11, 1995, KPLR-TV became a charter affiliate of The WB (a venture between Time Warner and Chicago-based Tribune Broadcasting), marking the first time it maintained an affiliation with a broadcast television network. Koplar had reached a deal to affiliate with The WB in November 1993, more than a year before the network&#x27;s launch. The WB offered prime time programs only on Wednesday evenings during its first half-season of operation, but would gradually evolve into offering a six-night-a-week schedule by September 1999; as such, for its first few years as a WB affiliate, KPLR continued to fill the 7–9 p.m. time slot with feature films and some first-run syndicated programs on nights when the network did not offer programming. During this period, alongside WB prime time programming and eventually animated series from the Kids&#x27; WB children&#x27;s program block, KPLR carried recent and some older off-network sitcoms and drama series, movies on weekends as well as in prime time on weekdays, some first-run syndicated shows, and a blend of animated and live-action children&#x27;s shows (including shows acquired via the syndication market as well as The Disney Afternoon block). For many years, even after joining The WB, KPLR was branded on-air as &quot;St. Louis 11&quot;, often using a logo with the &quot;O&quot; in &quot;St. Louis&quot; converted into its &quot;circle 11&quot; numeric logo. At one point, KPLR almost picked up Fox Kids since KTVI (which was a part of an affiliation agreement between Fox and New World Communications) declined to carry it, but Fox Kids was turned down by channel 11 station management (including its owner at that time Koplar Communications) because the owner felt that &quot;they had a strong slate of children&#x27;s programming and no room for the Rangers&quot;, and KNLC (channel 24), a religious independent station in the St. Louis market had to pick the affiliation up. Ultimately, by the spring of 1996, due to objections to program content and accompanying national advertising, New Life Evangelistic Center/KNLC owner Rev. Larry Rice began refusing to sell local advertising during the Fox Kids weekday and Saturday blocks ceding local advertising slots to air public service messages from Rice&#x27;s ministry that discussed various controversial moral issues (such as the death penalty, same-sex marriage and abortion), and reached an agreement with KTVI to carry Fox Kids starting in September 1996, making it the only New World-owned Fox station to carry the block.

On September 26, 1997, Koplar Communications announced it would sell KPLR to ACME Communications (owned by Jamie Kellner, who then also served as the chief executive officer of The WB) for $146 million. Five days later, on October 1, ACME assumed operational responsibilities for the station under a local marketing agreement with Koplar. The sale was finalized on March 1, 1998, ending 38 years of local, family ownership and earning a handsome return on their original investment. It would be ACME&#x27;s only station on the VHF band during the analog era, as all of the other stations they owned were on UHF. As part of the sale agreement, Ted Koplar signed a three-year contract to remain with KPLR-TV as the station&#x27;s CEO, along with serving as a consultant to ACME, for an annual salary of $1 million. However, Koplar resigned from KPLR/ACME in October 1999 after one year, citing an irreconcilable rift with ACME management.

In September 1998, KPLR changed its branding to &quot;WB11&quot;. In 2000, KPLR began carrying UPN programming in off-hours, running select prime time shows and cartoons from the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block, &quot;Disney&#x27;s One Too&quot;. UPN programs had previously run on KDNL during overnight and weekend timeslots and then on KNLC (channel 24, which subjected the network to several program preemptions due to content objections by owner, Larry Rice). St. Louis was one of the few top-50 markets without a UPN affiliate. The station continued carrying UPN in off-hours until July 2002, leaving UPN with no St. Louis affiliate until WRBU (channel 46) carried a secondary affiliation in September of that year; WRBU then became a primary UPN affiliate on April 1, 2003.

On December 30, 2002, Tribune Broadcasting announced it would purchase KPLR-TV and sister station KWBP in Portland, Oregon, from ACME Communications for $275 million; the sale was finalized on March 21, 2003. Also in 2003, KPLR moved its studios from the Chase Park Plaza (which by that time, went from a gutted complex where the station had been the only major tenant into a boutique hotel) to a new purpose-built studio facility in Maryland Heights.

===CW affiliation===
On January 24, 2006, UPN parent company CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom in December 2005) and WB network parent Time Warner (through its Warner Bros. Entertainment division) announced that they would dissolve the two networks to create The CW, a joint network venture that initially featured a mix of original first-run series and programs that originated on The WB and UPN. The network signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting for 16 of the 19 WB affiliates that the company owned at the time, including KPLR.

Nearly one month after the CW launch announcement, on February 22, 2006, News Corporation subsidiaries Fox Television Stations and Twentieth Television announced the launch of MyNetworkTV, a network created primarily to serve as a network programming option for UPN and WB stations that were left out of The CW&#x27;s affiliation deals. Three weeks later, on March 9, WRBU was confirmed to be the St. Louis market&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate. KPLR-TV remained a WB affiliate until the network ceased operations on September 17, 2006; when the station affiliated with The CW upon that network&#x27;s debut on September 18, KPLR began branding as &quot;CW 11&quot;. (WRBU joined MyNetworkTV upon that network&#x27;s launch on September 5.)

On September 17, 2008, Tribune announced that it would enter KPLR into a local marketing agreement with Fox affiliate KTVI effective October 1, as a result of the formation of a &quot;broadcast management company&quot; that was created to provide management services to stations owned by both Tribune Broadcasting and KTVI owner Local TV. Although KTVI was the senior partner in the deal, it vacated its longtime studios in the Clayton-Tamm/Dogtown neighborhood on St. Louis&#x27; west side and moved its operations to KPLR&#x27;s Maryland Heights facility. The LMA resulted in both stations combining their news departments and sharing certain syndicated programs. On November 1, 2008, the station changed its on-air branding from &quot;CW11&quot; to &quot;KPLR 11&quot; as several Tribune-owned CW affiliates began shifting away from using references to the network within their station branding, and reincorporated the Gateway Arch into its logo (essentially, a revision of the logo that KPLR used following the Tribune purchase as a WB affiliate).

Tribune bought KTVI outright on July 1, 2013, as part of its $2.75 billion acquisition of Local TV; the sale received FCC approval on December 20, and was completed on December 27, creating the first legal station duopoly in the St. Louis market between KTVI and KPLR. Tribune&#x27;s direct purchase of KTVI to form a duopoly with KPLR was possible as, in recent years, KPLR and KDNL have rotated between fourth and fifth place in total day viewership due to the weaker viewership of KDNL&#x27;s programming since its news department was shut down by Sinclair in 2001 (KPLR ranked in fifth place in total day ratings at the time of the purchase, with KDNL ranking in fourth place).

There have long been rumors that ABC has considered moving its affiliation to KPLR, in part because KDNL-TV has been one of the network&#x27;s weakest affiliates since joining the network in 1995 (in stark contrast to KTVI&#x27;s former status as one of ABC&#x27;s strongest affiliates). However, on March 26, 2010, KDNL owner Sinclair Broadcast Group extended its affiliation agreement with ABC to retain the network&#x27;s affiliation on KDNL and the eight other ABC affiliates that Sinclair owned at the time for five years through August 2015.

===Aborted sale to Sinclair; sale to Nexstar===

Sinclair—which has owned KDNL-TV since the group&#x27;s 1996 acquisition of its previous corporate parent River City Broadcasting—entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in Tribune debt. Prohibited from owning all three stations, Sinclair would have been required to sell KPLR to a third party to comply with ownership rules and alleviate potential antitrust issues. The deal received significant scrutiny over Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, prompting the FCC to designate it for hearing and leading Tribune to terminate the deal and sue Sinclair for breach of contract.

Following the Sinclair deal&#x27;s collapse, Nexstar Media Group of Irving, Texas, announced its purchase of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.

==Programming==
Since 2008, KPLR has aired CW network programming from 8 to 10 p.m. Central Time, one hour after the network-recommended timeslot for its programming in that time zone but consistent with its local airtimes in the Eastern and Pacific time zones, in order to air a 7 p.m. local newscast. This practice extends to programming such as &quot;WWE NXT&quot; which typically airs live on The CW&#x27;s other Central Time affiliates.

KPLR also airs Fox programs that are preempted for other broadcasts by KTVI, such as local newscasts. For example, a 2021 college football matchup between Illinois and Nebraska was moved to KPLR due to KTVI&#x27;s obligation to air Green Bay Packers preseason games.

===Sports programming===
KPLR-TV served as the home broadcaster of MLB&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals (for two stints from 1959 to 1962 and 1988 to 2006), the NBA&#x27;s St. Louis Hawks (1959–1968) and the NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues (for three stints from 1967 to 1976, 1982–83 and 1986 to April 21, 2009, the last Blues telecast on KPLR being a Stanley Cup playoff loss to the Vancouver Canucks). Both the Cardinals and Blues are now exclusive to Bally Sports Midwest, which formerly (as FSN Midwest) produced the games for the station throughout the late 90s and early 2000s. The production of the games before that time was from Bud Sports Productions, a division of Anheuser-Busch. During its WB years, KPLR-TV also syndicated its coverage of the Cardinals games to other stations in Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.

On May 23, 1959, the station debuted &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot;, a professional wrestling program that was originally produced from Chase Park Plaza&#x27;s Khorassan Ballroom (until 1970). The show featured the most famous wrestlers in the National Wrestling Alliance, which was controlled in part by St. Louis promoter Sam Muchnick. Participants included Ric Flair, Harley Race, former NFL player Dick the Bruiser and Ted DiBiase, and is considered one of the wrestling industry&#x27;s most historic programs. About 1,100 episodes were produced during the show&#x27;s run, which ended on September 10, 1983, when Muchnick retired from promoting and handed the slot over to the World Wrestling Federation. Even after WWF took over the programming, they still taped matches at the KPLR studios and aired a variant of its syndicated programming under the &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; banner, mostly offered to Midwestern stations who had previously aired Muchnick shows. Arguably KPLR&#x27;s most notable wrestling moment came after it ceased airing locally produced content: on December 27, 1983, a &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; taping contained the WWF debut of Hulk Hogan, who would become an international superstar with the promotion. KPLR produced a retrospective of the program in 1999, consisting mostly of latter-era footage plus interview clips of Muchnick&#x27;s wrestlers and other employees, as well as others associated with the St. Louis sports scene such as Bob Costas and Joe Garagiola, the latter the program&#x27;s first host. Included were clips from the program&#x27;s only known surviving early episode, from 1962, which Garagiola recorded as an audition tape before leaving the program and kept throughout the years.

From April 9, 2006, to September 7, 2008, KPLR produced &quot;The Fan Show&quot;, a live sports talk program that was hosted by sports director Rich Gould, featuring audience-participation games and discussion. It was originally broadcast from The Casino Queen&#x27;s Club Sevens for the first 20 months of its run, before the program relocated to AJ&#x27;s Bar and Grill in December 2007.

===Children&#x27;s programming===
From 1959 to 1968, KPLR aired the after-school children&#x27;s program &quot;Captain 11&#x27;s Showboat&quot;, which introduced The Three Stooges to St. Louis area television viewers. Captain 11 was played by longtime radio personality Harry Fender. Ted Koplar also diversified his family&#x27;s entertainment holdings during his time at the helm of KPLR. This was most notably achieved through World Events Productions, which distributed three animated series &quot;&quot;, &quot;Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs&quot;, and &quot;Denver, the Last Dinosaur&quot;.

===News operation===
KPLR presently broadcasts 22 hours of locally produced newscasts each week; including a public affairs program on Saturday evenings called &quot;The Pulse of St. Louis&quot;, which airs over the final 45 minutes of the 7 p.m. newscast, and a weekly sports highlight program on Sunday evenings called &quot;Sunday Sports Extra&quot;, which also airs during that newscast.

Channel 11 has aired local news programs since its sign-on, and was one of the first independent stations in the country to have a functioning news department. Like most stations that are not affiliated with one of the Big Three networks, KPLR had traditionally aired a prime time newscast at 9 p.m. that ran one hour ahead of the late newscasts seen on the major network affiliates; for much of the time prior to 2008, KPLR&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast ran as a half-hour program. After KTVI moved its late evening newscast to 9 p.m. following its August 1995 switch from ABC to Fox, that station&#x27;s prime time newscast consistently beat KPLR&#x27;s in the ratings.

In the past, KPLR has attempted to format its newscasts to attract a younger audience, employing anchors under the age of 35 and featuring a more fast-paced reporting style. Nevertheless, KPLR has often been acknowledged by &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; television critics as a station strong on &quot;sweeps stories&quot;, running one or more major investigative pieces during the November, February and May sweeps periods. KPLR&#x27;s stories have also been seen as much more broad-based and less sensationalistic compared to other stations.

After entering into the local marketing agreement with KTVI, major changes were made to KPLR&#x27;s news programming. First on September 8, 2008, KPLR shifted the flagship 9 p.m. newscast to 7 p.m. and expanded the program to one hour, trading timeslots with The CW&#x27;s prime time schedule, which the station moved to 8–10 p.m. (instead of the network-recommended 7–9 p.m. Central Time slot) with the network&#x27;s permission; this effectively resulted in the newscast being reduced to airing only on Monday through Friday evenings in part due to The CW airing a three-hour prime time lineup on Sundays at the time (although The CW turned its Sunday prime time slots over to the network&#x27;s affiliates in September 2009, the 7 p.m. newscast would not expand to weekends until September 2012). The station cited an underserved younger audience in the 9 p.m. timeslot with the Big Three stations airing network programming meant for older viewers and competition from KTVI&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast as reasons behind the move.

In December 2008, KPLR moved production of its news programs to a temporary set in KTVI&#x27;s Hampton studios as the Maryland Heights facility was being remodeled to accommodate both KPLR and KTVI&#x27;s newscasts. On February 16, 2009, KPLR became the fourth St. Louis television station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (one day after KTVI converted its newscasts to HD), broadcasting from a newly remodeled studio (which contained pieces from the KTVI&#x27;s former &quot;Studio B&quot; set, along with a modernized news desk and a state-of-the-art weather center) that is located adjacent to the main news set now occupied by KTVI. Since KPLR and KTVI&#x27;s news departments merged, there has been considerable sharing between the two stations in regards to news coverage, video footage and the use of reporters, although both outlets maintain their own primary on-air personalities (such as news and sports anchors) that only appear on one station. On April 6, 2009, KPLR debuted an hour-long midday newscast at noon on weekdays. This was followed on September 20, 2010, with the debut of an hour-long afternoon newscast at 4 p.m. On December 23, 2011, KPLR/KTVI opened a news bureau in the newly renovated Peabody Opera House in downtown St. Louis, to better serve the downtown and eastern portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area.

On January 28, 2015, both stations introduced a new combined set with LED lighting, two video walls, and a new anchor desk. Both stations now share the set but KPLR has a separate weather center. They also introduced new graphics and music package for both stations the same day.

In mid-2019, both stations introduced &quot;The Power of Two: Midday&quot;, replacing &quot;Fox 2 News Midday&quot; and &quot;News 11 at Noon&quot;. The program is aired live at 11 a.m. on KTVI and KPLR.

On January 30, 2020, both stations introduced a new graphics package and music package for each station. KPLR&#x27;s simulcasts with KTVI uses the same music package, &quot;Beyond&quot;, while KPLR-specific newscasts use &quot;Inergy&quot;, both were created by Stephen Arnold Music.

In spring 2020, both stations introduced &quot;The Power of Two at 6 am&quot;, which is simulcast on KTVI and KPLR. While branded for both stations, it is largely targeted towards the KTVI audience, as it is part of &quot;Fox 2 News in The Morning&quot;.

In February 2021, both stations overhauled their set again with an expansion of the physical studio space with multiple venues and a larger video wall. KPLR no longer has a separate weather center, now just appearing on the same set as KTVI.

In February 2025, KPLR-TV&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded to come under KTVI&#x27;s &quot;Fox 2 News&quot; branding.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other St. Louis television stations:
On May 31, 2006, KPLR added The Tube Music Network to digital subchannel 11.2; The Tube later abruptly suspended its operations on October 1, 2007. In 2010, the 11.2 subchannel became an affiliate of This TV. On January 1, 2016, the 11.3 subchannel became a Comet affiliate.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KPLR-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 26, using virtual channel 11.

<text>John Charles Carney Jr. (born May 20, 1956) is an American politician who has served as the 57th mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, since 2025. A member of the Democratic Party, Carney was the 74th Governor of Delaware from 2017 to 2025, the U.S. representative for from 2011 to 2017, the 24th lieutenant governor of Delaware from 2001 to 2009, and Delaware&#x27;s secretary of finance from 1996 to 2000.

He first unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 2008, losing to Jack Markell. He ran for governor again in 2016 and won, succeeding Markell, who was term-limited. He was reelected in 2020, defeating Republican Julianne Murray with 59.5% of the vote. Carney won the 2024 Wilmington mayoral election, winning the primary election in September by 743 votes and the November general election with no opposition.

==Early life and education==
Carney was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Claymont, the second of nine children of Ann Marie (née Buckley) and John Charles &quot;Jack&quot; Carney. Both his parents were educators. His great-grandparents immigrated from Ireland. Carney was quarterback of the 1973 state championship St. Mark&#x27;s High School football team, and earned All-Ivy League and Most Valuable Player honors in football at Dartmouth College, from which he graduated in 1978. At Dartmouth, he joined the local Beta Alpha Omega fraternity. He later coached freshman football at the University of Delaware while earning his master&#x27;s degree in public administration.

==Early political career==

Carney served as Deputy Chief Administrative Officer of New Castle County and as Secretary of Finance and Deputy Chief of Staff for Governor Tom Carper. He was elected lieutenant governor of Delaware in 2000 and served from January 16, 2001, until January 20, 2009. As lieutenant governor, he presided over the Delaware State Senate and chaired the Board of Pardons. He also chaired the Delaware Health Care Commission, the Interagency Council on Adult Literacy, the Criminal Justice Council, the Center for Education Technology, and the Livable Delaware Advisory Council. In 2002 he launched the education initiative &quot;Models of Excellence in Education&quot; to identify practices in schools that have raised student achievement. Carney was also selected by other lieutenant governors to chair the National Lieutenant Governors Association from July 2004 to July 2005.

Carney has long been an advocate for wellness issues in Delaware, sponsoring &quot;BeHealthy Delaware&quot; and &quot;The Lt. Governor&#x27;s Challenge&quot; to encourage Delawareans to be more active and address the state&#x27;s high rate of chronic disease. He fought for Delaware&#x27;s public smoking ban to improve health, cut cancer rates, and discourage teens from starting to smoke.

After completing his tenure as lieutenant governor in 2009, Carney served as president and chief operating officer of Transformative Technologies, which is investing in the DelaWind project, to bring offshore wind turbine construction to Delaware. He planned to step down in early 2010 to concentrate on his U.S. House campaign.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

Carney was the Democratic nominee for Delaware&#x27;s at-large seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2010. He faced Republican Glen Urquhart, Independent Party of Delaware nominee Earl R. Lofland, Libertarian Brent A. Wangen, and Blue Enigma Party nominee Jeffrey Brown. The seat had been held since 1993 by Republican Michael Castle, who declined to seek reelection to the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate seat once held by Vice President Joe Biden. In the first week of October, Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15-point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%. Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Carney leading by 17 points, 53% to 36% among likely voters. Carney won the seat by 16 points, 57%-41%, and took office on January 3, 2011. His victory was one of the three seats Democrats gained in a year when they lost a net 63 seats to the Republicans.

In his bid for a second term in 2012, Carney faced Republican Tom Kovach, the president of the New Castle County Council, and two minor candidates. In a debate with Kovach, Carney said, &quot;I will continue to do in Washington what I did in Delaware: work across the aisle to get things done. I learned early on that compromise is part of life.&quot; Carney called the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) &quot;not perfect&quot; but the &quot;only chance we have to get costs under control&quot;. He was reelected in a landslide, with 64% of the vote to Kovach&#x27;s 33%. Carney ran for reelection to a third term in 2014. He defeated Republican Rose Izzo, 59% to 37%, with Green nominee Bernie August and Libertarian Scott Gesty taking 2% each.

In 2011, Carney and Illinois Republican Aaron Schock co-sponsored a bill that would use U.S. oil exploration to help fund a five-year federal highway construction project.

On April 7, 2014, Carney introduced the Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4414; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would exempt expatriate health care plans from the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high-quality health care plans designed to meet their unique needs. He said that &quot;expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a global network of health care providers.&quot; He indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the Affordable Care Act&#x27;s tax and reporting requirements would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans.

Carney has served on the Committee on Financial Services, Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises, Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade, and Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

== Governor of Delaware ==

Carney sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 2008, as incumbent Governor Ruth Ann Minner was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Despite the backing of most of the party establishment, he lost the primary in an upset by fewer than 2,000 votes to State Treasurer Jack Markell, who went on to win the general election. Carney sought the Democratic nomination for governor again in 2016, as Markell was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. Carney won the Democratic primary unopposed and went on to win the general election. He won a second term in 2020, defeating Republican Julianne Murray in a landslide in the general election, with 59.5% of the vote compared to her 38.6%.

On July 12, 2017, after signing Executive Order 11 to reestablish the Juvenile Justice Advisory Group, Carney said, &quot;The Juvenile Justice Advisory Group will help us create an environment where all Delaware kids have an opportunity to succeed. This Executive Order will recharge and reenergize the group to find solutions that will work.&quot; On July 20, he vetoed a Delaware House of Representatives bill removing the five-mile radius of Delaware charter schools with enrollment preference and keeping out students in Wilmington, charging it with negatively impacting &quot;some of our most vulnerable students.&quot;

On October 13, 2017, in response to President Donald Trump&#x27;s ending cost-sharing reductions within the American health care system, Carney said the choice would lead to &quot;more people being uninsured in our state, which eventually means increased premiums for all of us&quot; and pledged he would work with the state congressional delegation to return the cost-sharing reductions.

In April 2019, Carney pardoned Barry Croft, a Bear resident who had served a three-year sentence for possessing a gun during the commission of a felony. In October 2020, Croft was arrested and federally charged for his involvement in a kidnapping plot against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. The day after Croft&#x27;s arrest, Carney confirmed the pardon, called the federal charges &quot;disturbing&quot;, and said, &quot;This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics.&quot;

On March 12, 2020, one day after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the state, Carney declared a State of Emergency in Delaware due to a public health threat. He issued a series of declarations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Delaware.

On May 24, 2022, Carney vetoed a bill to legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults for recreational use, incurring the wrath of fellow Democrats who have fought for years to make cannabis legal.

In June 2022, Carney signed six gun safety bills into law, including an assault weapons ban.

On April 21, 2023, Carney said he would not veto a bill legalizing possession of up to one ounce of cannabis, which led to cannabis effectively becoming legalized in Delaware on April 23 after a bill passed without Carney&#x27;s signature.

On September 20, 2024, Carney vetoed a bill to legalize assisted suicide for patients with a terminal illness and less than six months to live.

== Mayor of Wilmington ==

Prevented by term limits from running for reelection in 2024, Carney was reported in late 2023 to be &quot;seriously considering&quot; a run to replace retiring mayor Mike Purzycki as mayor of Wilmington. He announced his candidacy in April, and faced former state treasurer and Wilmington city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter in the September Democratic primary. He won the primary 53.8% to 46.2%, and was unopposed in the November general election. Carney is the first sitting governor ever to be elected a mayor.

==Personal life==
Carney married Tracey Quillen, daughter of Delaware Secretary of State William T. Quillen, on June 5, 1993. They have two children, Sam and Jimmy, who attended Wilmington Friends School. Sam Carney graduated from Clemson University, while Jimmy is a computer science major at Tufts University. In 2015, Sam Carney was named as one of a number of defendants in two separate lawsuits filed by the parents of Tucker Hipps, whose 2014 death allegedly occurred during a fraternity hazing incident. The lawsuit was settled in July 2017. Criminal charges have never been filed in the case despite there being no statute of limitations in South Carolina.

Carney&#x27;s nephew is Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Brian O&#x27;Neill.

Carney is Roman Catholic.

==Electoral history==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The lieutenant governor takes office the third Tuesday of January with a four-year term. U.S. Representatives take office January 3 and have a two-year term.

<doc id="850599" wikidata="Q16000316" url="?curid=850599" title="Role theory">
<text>Role theory is a concept in sociology and in social psychology that considers most of everyday activity to be the acting-out of socially defined categories (e.g., mother, manager, teacher). Each role is a set of rights, duties, expectations, norms, and behaviors that a person has to face and fulfill. The model is based on the observation that people behave in a predictable way, and that an individual&#x27;s behavior is context specific, based on social position and other factors. Research conducted on role theory mainly centers around the concepts of consensus, role conflict, role taking, and conformity. The theatre is a metaphor often used to describe role theory.

Although the word &quot;role&quot; (or &quot;roll&quot;) has existed in European languages for centuries, as a sociological concept, the term has only been around since the 1920s and 1930s. It became more prominent in sociological discourse through the theoretical works of George Herbert Mead, Jacob L. Moreno, Talcott Parsons, Ralph Linton, and Georg Simmel. Two of Mead&#x27;s concepts—the mind and the self—are the precursors to role theory.

The theory posits the following propositions about social behavior:
# The division of labor in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions that we call roles;
# Social roles included &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;permitted&quot; forms of behavior, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine expectations;
# Roles are occupied by individuals, or &quot;actors&quot;;
# When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role &quot;legitimate&quot; and &quot;constructive&quot;), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms;
# Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change;
# The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving in a prosocial way, account for why agents conform to role requirements.

In terms of differences among role theory, on one side there is a more functional perspective, which can be contrasted with the more micro-level approach of the symbolic interactionist tradition. This type of role theory dictates how closely related individuals&#x27; actions are to society, as well as how empirically testable a particular role theory perspective may be.

Depending on the general perspective of the theoretical tradition, there are many types of role theory, however, it may be divided into two major types, in particular: structural functionalism role theory and dramaturgical role theory. Structural functionalism role theory is essentially defined as everyone having a place in the social structure and every place had a corresponding role, which has an equal set of expectations and behaviors. Life is more structured, and there is a specific place for everything. In contrast, dramaturgical role theory defines life as a never-ending play, in which we are all actors. The essence of this role theory is to role-play in an acceptable manner in society.

Robert Kegan’s theory of adult development plays a role in understanding role theory. Three pivotal sections in his theory are first the socialized mind. People in this mindset, base their actions on the opinion of others. The second part is the self-authorized mind, this mindset breaks loose of others thoughts and makes their own decisions. The last part in this theory is the self-transforming mind. This mindset listens to the thoughts and opinions of others, yet still is able to choose and make the decision for themselves. Less than 1 percent of people are in the self-transforming mindset. For the socialized mind, 60 percent of people are in this mindset well into their adult years. Role theory is following perceived roles and standards that people in society normalize. People are confined to roles that have been placed around them due to the socialized mind. The internalization of the value of others in society leads to role theory.

A key insight of this theory is that role conflict occurs when a person is expected to simultaneously act out multiple roles that carry contradictory expectations. They are pulled in different ways as they strive to hold various types of societal standards and statuses.

== Role ==

Substantial debate exists in the field over the meaning of the &quot;role&quot; in role theory. A &quot;role&quot; can be defined as a social position, behavior associated with a social position, or a typical behavior. Some theorists have put forward the idea that roles are essentially expectations about how an individual ought to behave in a given situation, whereas others consider it means how individuals actually behave in a given social position. Some have suggested that a role is a characteristic behavior or expected behavior, a part to be played, or a script for social conduct.

In sociology, there are different categories of social roles: 
# cultural roles: roles given by culture (e.g. priest)
# social differentiation: e.g. teacher, taxi driver
# situation-specific roles: e.g. eye witness
# bio-sociological roles: e.g. as human in a natural system
# gender roles: as a man, woman, mother, father, etc.

Role theory models behavior as patterns of behaviors to which one can &quot;conform&quot;, with this conformity being based on the &quot;expectations&quot; of others.

It has been argued that a role must in some sense being defined in relation to others. The manner and degree is debated by sociologists. Turner used the concept of an &quot;other-role&quot;, arguing the process of defining a role is negotiating one&#x27;s role with other-roles.

=== The construction of roles ===

Turner argued that the process of describing a role also modifies the role which would otherwise be implicit, referring to this process as &quot;role-making&quot; arguing that very formal roles such as those in the military are not representative of roles because the role-making process is suppressed. Sociologist Howard S. Becker similarly claims that the label given and the definition used in a social context can change actions and behaviors.

Situation-specific roles develop &quot;ad hoc&quot; in a given social situation. However it can be argued that the expectations and norms that define this ad hoc role are defined by the social role.

The word consensus is used when a group of people have the same expectations through agreement. We live in a society where people know how they should act, which is a result of learned behaviors stemming from social norms. As a whole society follows typical roles and follows their expected norms. Subsequently, there is a standard created through the conformity of these social groups.

== The relationship between roles and norms ==

Some theorists view behavior as being enforced by social norms. Turner rather argues that there is a norm of consistency that failing to conform to a role breaks a norm because it violates consistency.

=== Cultural roles ===

Cultural roles are seen as a matter of course, and are mostly stable. In cultural changes new roles can develop and old roles can disappear – these cultural changes are affected by political and social conflicts. For example, the feminist movement initiated a change in male and female roles in Western societies. The roles, or the exact duties of men more specifically are being questioned. With more women going further in school than men comes more financial and occupational benefits. Unfortunately, these benefits have not been shown to increase women&#x27;s happiness.

=== Social differentiation ===

Social differentiation received a lot of attention due to the development of different job roles. Robert K. Merton distinguished between intrapersonal and interpersonal role conflicts. For example, a foreman has to develop his own social role facing the expectations of his team members and his supervisor – this is an interpersonal role conflict. He also has to arrange his different social roles as father, husband, club member – this is an intrapersonal role conflict.

Ralph Dahrendorf distinguished between must-expectations, with sanctions; shall-expectations, with sanctions and rewards and can-expectations, with rewards. The foreman has to avoid corruption; he should satisfy his reference groups (e.g. team members and supervisors); and he can be sympathetic. He argues another component of role theory is that people accept their own roles in the society and it is not the society that imposes them.

=== Role behavior ===
In their life people have to face different social roles, sometimes they have to face different roles at the same time in different social situations. There is an evolution of social roles: some disappear and some new develop. Role behavior is influenced by:
# The norms that determine a social situation.
# Internal and external expectations are connected to a social role.
# Social sanctions (punishment and reward) are used to influence role behavior.

These three aspects are used to evaluate one&#x27;s own behavior as well as the behavior of other people. Heinrich Popitz defines social roles as norms of behavior that a special social group has to follow. Norms of behavior are a set of behaviors that have become typical among group members; in case of deviance, negative sanctions follow.

=== Gender roles ===
Gender has played a crucial role in our societal norms and the distinction between how female and male roles are viewed in society. Specifically within the workplace, and in the home. Historically there was a division of roles created by society due to gender. Gender was a social difference between female and male; whereas sex was nature. Gender became a way to categorize men and women and divide them into their societal roles. Although gender is important there are many different ways that women are categorized in society. Other ways are racially and through class experience. While we have societal roles from gender, there will always be a separation between females and males.

Throughout history, the roles of women and men have changed with time as it progresses. Men developed traits that suited them for providing such as hunting and labor. Women acquired traits centered around children and home life. As the industry grew, men used their strength to find power and as a result they proceeded to obtain the majority of jobs.

Through the distinct roles of male and female, women developed communal traits that were needed for caring and nurturing those around them. Males developed agentic traits that allowed for roles in leadership, hunting, and labor.

With the advancement of times, with jobs and the industry moving away from strength and labor, women have advanced their education for employment. The sex segregation between women and men has decreased as time has matured and evolved away from traditional gender roles in society.

== In public relations ==
Role theory is a perspective that considers everyday activity to be acting out socially defined categories. Split into two narrower definitions: &quot;status&quot; is one&#x27;s position within a social system or group; and &quot;role&quot; is one&#x27;s pattern of behavior associated with a status.

Organizational role is defined as &quot;recurring actions of an individual, appropriately interrelated with the repetitive activities of others so as to yield a predictable outcome.&quot; (Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978). Within an organization there are three main topologies:

# Two-role typology:
## Manager
## Technician
# Four-role typology:
## Expert prescriber
## Communication facilitator
## Problem-Solving Process Facilitator
## Communication technician
# Five-role typology:
## Monitor and evaluator
## Key policy and strategic advisor
## Troubleshooter/problem solver
## Issues management expert
## Communication technician

==Role conflict, strain, or making ==
Despite variations in the terms used, the central component of all of the formulations is incompatibility.

Role conflict is a conflict among the roles corresponding to two or more statuses, for example, teenagers who have to deal with pregnancy (statuses: teenager, mother). Role conflict is said to exist when there are important differences among the ratings given for various expectations. By comparing the extent of agreement or disagreement among the ranks, a measure of role conflict was obtained.

Role strain or &quot;role pressure&quot; may arise when there is a conflict in the demands of roles, when an individual does not agree with the assessment of others concerning his or her performance in his or her role, or from accepting roles that are beyond an individual&#x27;s capacity.

&quot;Role making&quot; is defined by Graen as leader–member exchange.

At the same time, a person may have limited power to negotiate away from accepting roles that cause strain, because he or she is constrained by societal norms, or has limited social status from which to bargain.

==Criticism and limitations==

Role theorists have noted that a weakness of role theory is in describing and explaining deviant behavior.

Role theory has been criticized for reinforcing commonly held prejudices about how people should behave; have ways they should portray themselves as well as how others should behave, view the individual as responsible for fulfilling the expectations of a role rather than others responsible for creating a role that they can perform, and people have argued that role theory insufficiently explains power relations, as in some situations an individual does not consensually fulfill a role but is forced into behaviors by power.
It is also argued that role theory does not explain individual agency in negotiating their role and that role theory artificially merges roles when in practice an individual might combine roles together.

Others have argued that the concept of role takes on such a broad definition as to be meaningless.

<doc id="850604" wikidata="Q1342539" url="?curid=850604" title="Eric Brewer (ice hockey)">
<text>Eric Peter Brewer (born April 17, 1979) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played sixteen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 2000 to 2015. He is an NHL All-Star and Olympic gold medalist.

He began his career as a distinguished junior ice hockey player, named to the Western Hockey League (WHL) West Second All-Star Team and the Western Conference roster for the 1998 WHL All-Star Game (although he missed the game due to injury). Drafted in the first round, fifth overall by the New York Islanders in the 1997 NHL entry draft, Brewer has spent parts of his sixteen-year NHL career with the Islanders, the Edmonton Oilers, the St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, Anaheim Ducks and Maple Leafs, and captained the Blues for two years. He has also suited up for the Prince George Cougars of the WHL and the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). In 1999, Brewer was selected for the Prince George Cougars&#x27; all-time team in a Canadian Hockey League promotion.

Brewer has represented Canada at eight International Ice Hockey Federation-sanctioned events, winning three Ice Hockey World Championships gold medals and one World Cup of Hockey gold medal. He won his Olympic gold medal during the 2002 Winter Olympics. For this accomplishment, he was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame with his British Columbian teammates in 2003.

Brewer has been a part owner of the Prince George Cougars, the team with which he played his junior hockey, since 2014. In 2022, Brewer was inducted into the BC Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Brewer was born on April 17, 1979, in Vernon, British Columbia, to Anna and Frank Brewer. He was raised in Ashcroft, British Columbia, and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program. When he was fourteen, his family moved to Kamloops, British Columbia, where he attended junior and senior high school. Brewer excelled with the Kamloops Bantam AAA Jardine Blazers of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA). In 1995, Brewer was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever, a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition. As a young hockey player, Brewer looked up to NHL stars Scott Niedermayer and Jeremy Roenick as role models.

In mid-2004, Brewer married Rebecca Flann, whom he met while playing junior hockey with the Prince George Cougars; they live in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Brewers have two daughters. Brewer&#x27;s sister, Kristi, played for the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds women&#x27;s ice hockey team.

Brewer is involved in numerous charitable organizations. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Brewer participated in several charity hockey games, playing in the four-game Ryan Smyth and Friends All-Star Charity Tour, the three-game Brad May and Friends Hockey Challenge, as well as the Our Game to Give charity hockey game held at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario. During off-seasons, Brewer has participated in numerous charity golf tournaments, including the Burn Fund Golf Tournament in Prince George and the Recchi-Doan Charity Classic in Kamloops.

In 2014, Brewer became a part owner of the Prince George Cougars, joining a group of investors that includes fellow Cougars alumnus Dan Hamhuis. In July 2022, Brewer was inducted into the BC Hockey Hall of Fame as part of the 2020 induction class, after the original induction ceremony was postponed due to COVID-19-related gathering restrictions.

==Playing career==

===Prince George Cougars===
Brewer was drafted in the sixth round, 81st overall, by the Prince George Cougars in the 1994 WHL bantam draft. After being drafted, he played one final season with the Jardine Blazers, recording 38 points in only forty games. The following year, Brewer began his WHL career with the Cougars, playing 63 games in the 1995–96 season. Brewer finished his rookie WHL season with fourteen points, including four goals, and was named Cougars&#x27; Rookie of the Year.

In his sophomore season, Brewer became a leader on the Cougars&#x27; blue line. He was named to play for Team Orr in the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game in February 1997 at Maple Leaf Gardens. He doubled his point total from the previous season, finishing with 29 points in 71 games played. Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a playoff run. After clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record, the Cougars defeated the number-one seed Portland Winter Hawks in the conference quarterfinals and the third-ranked Spokane Chiefs in the conference semifinals before finally losing to the second-ranked Seattle Thunderbirds in the Western Conference final. Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars&#x27; fifteen games.

Brewer&#x27;s final season with Prince George was his best, statistically, in the WHL. After representing Canada at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, he was named to the Western Conference team for the WHL All-Star Game in Regina, Saskatchewan, which he missed, as well as much of the season, due to injury. However, Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games, a near one point-per-game average, and was named to the WHL West Second All-Star Team. Brewer was the highest ranked defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the 1997 NHL entry draft. He was drafted fifth overall by the New York Islanders in June 1997.

===New York Islanders===
Just over a year after being drafted, Brewer signed his first professional contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer was regarded as a future Norris Trophy candidate, and as a result, his contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie. Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes&#x27; Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered an integral part of the Islanders&#x27; defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.

After playing just three games of the 1999–2000 season, Brewer was assigned to the Islanders&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters. It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer, who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach Butch Goring after losing a race for the puck against Mike Knuble in the Islanders&#x27; October 11, 1999, loss to the New York Rangers. Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting the Islanders down two men. After a two-week, five-game stint with the Lock Monsters, Brewer was subsequently recalled by the Islanders. After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists, Brewer was reassigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8, 2000, for the remainder of the season. Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters, Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season. Brewer went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters, recording two goals and two assists. He also participated in his first professional playoffs, as the Lock Monsters swept the Saint John Flames in three games in the first round, before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Providence Bruins.

===Edmonton Oilers===
At the 2000 NHL entry draft, the Islanders traded Brewer, Josh Green and their second round selection (Brad Winchester) in the same draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised to be traded, Brewer was excited at the prospect of playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer&#x27;s Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.

The Oilers re-signed Brewer, who was a free agent, to a one-year, $907,500 contract in August 2001. In his second season with the Oilers, Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams&#x27; best offensive players by Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish. Brewer began to play more minutes in games, typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game. With this enhanced role on the team, Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points for the second consecutive season, and matched his career high in goals. Although his single year contract expired, his role on the Oilers had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his third season with the Oilers.

After a long holdout that lasted until the beginning of Oilers training camp, Brewer finally signed a two-year, $4-million contract in September 2002. At the half of the 2002–03 season, Brewer was named to play in his first NHL All-Star Game, dressing for the Western Conference in the fifty-third edition of the game. He finished with career highs for assists and points and set a career high for goals for the third consecutive season. He appeared in his second NHL playoffs, another quarterfinal series against the Dallas Stars in which the Oilers were once again eliminated four games to two. Brewer finished the playoffs with four points in the Oilers&#x27; six games.

In his fourth season with the Oilers, Brewer continued his role as a top defenceman. On November 22, 2003, Brewer was among the participants in the historic 2003 Heritage Classic ice hockey game versus the Montreal Canadiens at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4–3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57,167. Later in the season, in a game on January 29, 2004, versus the Chicago Blackhawks, Brewer recorded his one-hundredth career point. Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams&#x27; best offensive players, he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24:39, ranking fourteenth in the league. In the final year of his two-year contract, Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001–02 NHL season, a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers.

With the Oilers unwilling to pay what he was expecting, Brewer decided to go to salary arbitration to get a new contract. However, on August 4, 2004, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65 million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later. Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

===St. Louis Blues===

In August 2005, following the lockout, the Oilers traded Brewer, Jeff Woywitka and Doug Lynch to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for defenceman Chris Pronger. At the time of the trade, Brewer was a restricted free agent, so on August 15, 2005, Brewer accepted the Blues&#x27; qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract. Brewer&#x27;s first season with the Blues was a particularly poor one. After playing the first 18 games of the season, Brewer separated his shoulder on November 16, 2005, in a 2–0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. Brewer missed ten games before being activated from the injured reserve list, returning to the St. Louis line-up for a game on December 17, 2005, against the Philadelphia Flyers. Less than a month later, in a game on January 13, 2006, against the Atlanta Thrashers, Brewer collided with the Thrashers&#x27; centre Karl Stewart, and dislocated his left shoulder, which ended his season. In just 32 games, Brewer finished his season with nine points, including six goals, two shy of his career best of eight set in the 2002–03 season. Despite his limited play, the Blues re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $2.014 million contract for the 2006–07 season.

Brewer&#x27;s second season with the Blues began as a disappointment. By the first half of December 2006, Brewer had only amassed six points and a plus-minus rating of –11, often referred to as &quot;the worst player on the ice&quot; by both the media and Blues fans alike. Brewer was often involved in trade rumours, as he was set to become an unrestricted free agent following the completion of the season. Brewer believed his performance was the result of having only played in 32 NHL games since the 2003–04 season. However, after the firing of head coach Mike Kitchen on December 11, 2006, Brewer began playing much better under new head coach, Andy Murray. Over the next nineteen games, Brewer changed his –11 into a +2 and became an integral part of the Blues&#x27; defence. His turnaround was rewarded on February 24, 2007, when, rather than being traded as was previously rumoured, Brewer signed a four-year, $17-million contract extension with the Blues. Brewer continued his turnaround through the end of the season, finishing the year with six goals and 23 assists for 29 points, tying his career high for points set in the 2002–03 season and setting a new career high for assists.

In his third season with the Blues, Brewer continued to do well under Andy Murray. Brewer evolved into one of the top two-way defencemen in the NHL, with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick Chris Phillips of the Ottawa Senators. His play and leadership abilities were recognized, when on February 8, 2008, Brewer was named as the nineteenth captain in the history of the St. Louis Blues, filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain Dallas Drake had his contract bought out following the 2006–07 season. On February 17, 2008, in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, Brewer set a career high for points in a game with four, all assists, eclipsing his previous career high of three points set on January 16, 2007. Brewer finished the season with only one goal in his 77 games played, his lowest goal total since the 1999–2000 season, although he added 21 assists, three short of a career high. At the completion of the season, Brewer underwent reconstructive surgery on his right shoulder to repair damage suffered in a fight in the Blues&#x27; season opening game against the Phoenix Coyotes on October 4, 2007.

Despite Brewer&#x27;s end-of-season shoulder surgery, he was able to join the Blues for his fourth season with the team in time for their season-opening game against the Nashville Predators, where he led the Blues with 24:43 of ice time in a 5–2 victory. Eight days later, Brewer played in his 600th career NHL game, a 4–3 shootout victory against the Chicago Blackhawks. Prior to the Christmas break, Brewer underwent season-ending back surgery. The surgery ended Brewer&#x27;s season after only 28 games played and six points, his lowest games played and point totals since his sophomore season with the New York Islanders. Brewer subsequently underwent two more surgeries that off-season, including a second back surgery in April and a knee surgery in August.

Unlike the previous season, Brewer&#x27;s off-season surgeries delayed the start of his fifth season with the Blues until the team&#x27;s eleventh game of the season, a 2–0 loss to the Arizona Coyotes. Brewer had missed the Blues&#x27; previous 64 games prior to his return against the Coyotes, which was earlier than expected after rehabbing from his back surgeries that had been considered career threatening. Brewer&#x27;s health largely remained stable throughout the season as he finished the year with 15 points in 59 games played, including tying his career-high in goals with eight.

Healthy to begin his sixth season with the Blues, Brewer recorded his 200th career point on December 15, 2010 against the Detroit Red Wings, assisting on a goal by Carlo Colaiacovo. Brewer remained healthy well into the season, only missing one game in February due to his wife being in labour. However, as the 2011 NHL trade deadline approached, Brewer&#x27;s name was mentioned in trade rumours.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===

On February 18, 2011, Brewer was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Brock Beukeboom and Tampa Bay&#x27;s third-round selection in the 2011 NHL entry draft. In 22 games with Tampa Bay, he scored one goal and one assist. He also led the Lightning in average ice time per game, with 21:34. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Brewer recorded a career-high nine goals and also amassed 81 penalty minutes, good for the second-highest total of his NHL career. He also appeared in a career-high 18 post-season games with the Lightning in the 2011 playoffs, registering one goal and seven points, helping the Lightning in their first playoff appearance in four seasons. He set a career-high with three points in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins and finished the playoffs ranked third among all skaters with 51 blocked shots. On June 24, 2011, Brewer signed a four-year, $15.4 million contract extension with the Lightning.

The 2011–12 season was Brewer&#x27;s first full season with the Lightning and first under his four-year contract extension. Throughout the season, Brewer was relied upon heavily by the Lightning, leading the team in average ice time per game with 23:16. He finished the season having played in all 82 games, his first season without missing a single game since the 2006–07 season. He also set career highs with 176 shots blocked and 197 hits.

With the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement set to expire on September 15, 2012, the 2012–13 NHL lockout resulted in the postponement of the 2012–13 season until January 2013. Brewer did not play in Europe during the lockout, instead supporting the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) by participating in negotiations between the NHL and NHLPA. Upon the end of the lockout, Brewer started the season with a two-goal performance in the Lightning&#x27;s season opening 6–3 victory against the Washington Capitals. Brewer finished the lockout-shortened season with twelve points while playing in all 48 games.

After Martin St. Louis was traded at the 2014 NHL trade deadline and Steven Stamkos replaced him as team captain, Brewer was named as an alternate captain for the rest of the 2013–14 NHL season. Brewer appeared in all four games for the Lightning during the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs as the team was swept in their first round series against the Montreal Canadiens.

===Anaheim Ducks===
On November 28, 2014, while in the final year of his contract with the Lightning, Brewer was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2015 NHL entry draft. At the time, Brewer had appeared in 17 games with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season and had four assists on the year. He finished his career with the Lightning having played in 246 games and scored ten goals and 46 assists. The next night, Brewer played in his first game with the Ducks, recording 15:07 in ice time in a 6–4 loss to the San Jose Sharks. On December 3, 2014, after playing in only two games for the Ducks, the team announced that Brewer was expected to miss four-to-six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot from a blocked shot. Brewer returned to the Ducks lineup two months later on February 3, 2015 against the Carolina Hurricanes and scored his first goal for Anaheim on February 8, 2015 against his former teammates in a 5–3 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On March 2, 2015, the 2015 NHL trade deadline, the Ducks traded Brewer and a fifth-round pick in the 2016 NHL entry draft to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for defenceman Korbinian Holzer, ending a brief nine game career with the Anaheim Ducks. Brewer&#x27;s first game as a member of the Maple Leafs came on March 5, 2015 against the Tampa Bay Lighting. On March 21, 2015, Brewer became the 300th NHL player to play in 1,000 career games in a 5–3 loss to the Ottawa Senators. Two days later, the Maple Leafs honored Brewer&#x27;s achievement with a ceremony prior to their game against the Minnesota Wild, at which they presented him with a silver stick, and Rolex watch, and a $10,000 charitable donation in his name. He scored his first goal with the club two games later, the game-winning overtime goal in a 4–3 victory over the Ottawa Senators on March 28, 2015. After missing the playoffs with the Maple Leafs, Brewer finished the 2014–15 season with two goals and three assists in eighteen games with the Maple Leafs. Through his entire 2014–15 NHL season with the Lightning, Ducks, and Maple Leafs, Brewer scored three goals and eight assists in 44 games played, the fewest games played of his career since his injury-plagued 2008–09 season with the St. Louis Blues.

He became a free agent in the 2015 offseason, signing a professional tryout contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was released by the Penguins just days before the 2015–16 season was to start.

==International play==




Throughout his career, Brewer has represented Canada at various international ice hockey tournaments. He first competed internationally as a member of Team Pacific Canada at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton, New Brunswick. Three years later, he represented Canada as a whole as a member of the national junior team at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he was named an alternate captain. This was the tournament in which Canada had its worst ever showing, an eighth-place finish including a loss to Kazakhstan, giving Brewer an unkind welcome to IIHF international ice hockey. Although eligible for the 1999 edition of the same tournament, Brewer was unable to play due to NHL commitments with the New York Islanders.

Brewer made his debut with the Canadian national men&#x27;s team on April 24, 2001, when he joined Canada for the 2001 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships in Nuremberg, Cologne, and Hanover, Germany. Later that year, on July 24, 2001, Brewer was invited to the orientation camp for the Canadian team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Five months later, on December 12, 2001, Brewer was named to the final Canadian roster for the tournament. In the opening game of the tournament against Sweden, Brewer scored Canada&#x27;s second goal of the game in a 5–2 loss, while in the semi-finals of the tournament, Brewer scored the game-winning goal against Belarus in a 7–1 victory, helping send Canada to the gold medal game against the host United States. Canada would go on to defeat the Americans by a score of 5–2, winning their first Olympic gold medal in fifty years.

Shortly after his Olympic experience, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2002 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships in Gothenburg, Karlstad and Jönköping, Sweden, his second consecutive Ice Hockey World Championships. He represented Canada once again the following year, when on April 22, 2003, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2003 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships. In the tournament quarterfinals versus Germany, Brewer scored the game-winning goal 37 seconds into overtime to give Canada a 3–2 victory. Canada would go on to win their first Ice Hockey World Championships gold medal since the 1997 tournament, defeating Sweden 3–2 in overtime in the final. Brewer once again participated for Canada at the 2004 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, his fourth consecutive Ice Hockey World Championships, where he helped Canada win its second consecutive championship after defeating Sweden 5–3 in the gold medal game.

On May 15, 2004, Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. In the semifinal of the tournament, Brewer scored Canada&#x27;s first goal of the game in 4–3 overtime victory against the Czech Republic. Team Canada would go on to win the tournament on home ice in Toronto, defeating Finland 3–2 in the final. Just under one year following his World Cup appearance, Brewer was named to the orientation camp for the Canadian team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy held from August 15–20, 2005, in Vancouver and Kelowna, British Columbia. Following the camp, on October 18, 2005, Brewer was named to the preliminary 81-man Canadian roster for the tournament. However, when the final roster was announced on December 21, 2005, Brewer was not among the 26 players listed. As a result, it would be nearly three years before Brewer would next suit up for his country, when on April 3, 2007, Brewer was among the first five players named to play for Canada at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Moscow and Mytishchi, Russia. For the tournament, Brewer was named as the team&#x27;s only permanent alternate captain and helped the team to its third gold medal at the tournament in the past five years.

<text>Disney Networks Group Asia Pacific was a Hong Kong–based commercial broadcasting company operating multiple specialty television channels. The company was founded in 1991 by Hong Kong businessman Richard Li.

Originally established by Hutchison Whampoa and later acquired by the original News Corporation, Star TV was once the most prominent satellite television broadcaster in Asia. On 20 March 2019, following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Fox Networks Group Asia and Star India became a part of Disney, and Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific merged with the Disney Branded Television unit.

DNG Asia Pacific&#x27;s channels were available in Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East.

==History==
===Launch===
The company was originally registered to the Companies Registry of Hong Kong as Quford Limited on 31 August 1990. The company was renamed Hutchvision Channel Services Limited on 31 January 1991 before becoming Satellite Television Asian Region Limited () on 4 July 1991, or STAR. It was established by Hutchison Whampoa and was headed by Richard Li. Li is the son of Li Ka-Shing (founder of Cheung Kong, a subsidiary of which is Hutchison Whampoa). 

Hutchvision&#x27;s plan interfered in the development of Hong Kong&#x27;s cable network, facing concerns that it would cause competition for both viewers and advertisers from other satellite and terrestrial networks. At the time, Wharf Holdings had a 28% stake, followed by Sun Hung Kai at 27%, Run Run Shaw&#x27;s Shaw Brothers at 10% and US West and Belgium&#x27;s Coditel at 25% each. As of September 1990, it had twelve transponders available on AsiaSat 1, but ending the lease before 31 December was a possibility. In December 1990, it had set a new deadline to start its services -7 the end of 1991. The initial plan outlined two to three channels in its initial phase, catering mainly to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Thailand, and carrying music and sports. The Asiasat-1 beam enabled the channels to be picked up by a potential audience of 2.3 billion viewers. There were talks of the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation holding shares in the company, with its main goal being delivering its programming abroad.

The company operated its television channels under a unified brand, Star TV (). The company&#x27;s strategy was to target the top 5 percent of Asian elites who spoke English and had bought power to offer pan-Asian English programming. In its initial years, the channels were broadcast over AsiaSat 1, a communication satellite operated by Asia Satellite Telecommunications (a consortium of Hutchison Whampoa, China International Trust and Investment Corporation and Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide). Its digital electronic services were funded by Sony. Hutchvision itself owned one third of AsiaSat and Star TV used ten out of the twenty-four transponders in the AsiaSat 1 satellite.

The channels were able to reach from the Far East to the Middle East, broadcasting across 38 countries around the region.

Star TV&#x27;s had five channels on their initial line-up: Star Sports, Star Music, Star News, Star Chinese and Star Entertainment; Star Entertainment was only available with a paid subscription.

On 1 October 1992, Star TV added Zee TV (which targeted Hindi-speaking audiences) from Zee Telefilms in India to its line-up.

In 1993, Goldman Sachs became the exclusive advisor to Hutchison Whampoa Limited and the Li family in their largest Asian media merger to date.
In February 1993, Julian Mounter, former director-general of Television New Zealand, was appointed as president and Chief Executive of the company.
In March 1993, Star TV was partnered with Asia Business News. By that year, the service&#x27;s advertisement bookings were extensive. While starting their pay-TV services, Julian Mounter — the chief executive and the president of HutchVision — stated that the company planned to launch the AsiaSat 2 satellite sometime in the subsequent two years. Mounter also signed agreements with four companies, mostly programme suppliers, stating that the company would have as many as six channels operating by April 1994. He also said that the programmes would include more English and Chinese movie channels, a business channel, a children&#x27;s channel, a documentary channel, and another entertainment channel. With the launch of the new AsiaSat satellite, Star TV would have the capability to broadcast as many as one-hundred channels. In June 1993, Star TV and Wharf Cable signed a deal in which Hong Kong&#x27;s new cable television provider would carry Star TV&#x27;s channels. However, the deal was terminated in February 1994 in a dispute between the two parties.

===Sale to News Corporation===

Star TV&#x27;s viewership across Asia increased over the years and it attracted advertisers, but the business was not turning a profit. The company was looking for an Anglophone partner for financial investments, along with additional English language programming and technical assistance. They were hoping to launch a pay-television system that would carry encrypted channels.

On 1 May 1993, Pearson approached Star TV&#x27;s owners, seeking a partnership, and was expected to invest up to GBP 100 million. Pearson (which owned minor stake in British broadcasters BSkyB and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television at the time, and had just acquired Thames Television) was looking to expand its media business outside the UK, especially because the British laws at the time did not allow Pearson to expand more on UK television business. Pearson was looking for 66% of the company, but the deal was reported to have required the Hong Kong side to remain active shareholders, causing the deal to fall through. The initial negotiations with Rupert Murdoch were reported to have floundered after the Australian businessman demanded a controlling stake in the Hong Kong company. On the same day, Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation purchased 63.6% of Star TV for $525 million US dollars, half in cash, half in News Corporation&#x27;s ordinary shares, blocking offers from Pearson. The deal came after News Corporation failed to acquire 22% of TVB because of regulatory issues. News Corporation acquired the remaining 36.4% for US$299 million in July 1995. The Li family and Hutchison Whampoa would retain its shares in Hutchvision Hong Kong Limited, which uplinked Star TV&#x27;s channels. With the money he made from the 1993 sale, Richard Li went on to establish Pacific Century Group. It was later theorized by author Shiau Hong-chi that Murdoch&#x27;s purchase of Star TV was based on a theory of media globalization, assuming that people across every nation and language would watch the same TV programmes, with the original plan for Star TV being to broadcast popular American shows to Asian audiences. However, the plan was unsuccessful, with Star TV being forced to invest heavily into producing local shows for their Asian audience. On 1 August 1993, following News Corporation&#x27;s takeover, Julian Mounter resigned as Chief Executive of the company. Sam Chisholm (head of BSkyB at the time) became acting Chief Executive of News Corporation before he was formally appointed.

On 26 July 1993, Star TV was purchased by Rupert Murdoch for US$525 million. This was Murdoch&#x27;s most important acquisition since the debt-restructuring crisis in 1990. He also bought Hutchvision, Star TV&#x27;s parent company.

As of 1993, Star TV&#x27;s channel line-up consisted of MTV Asia, BBC World Service Television, a sports channel, an English-language entertainment channel, and a Chinese-language entertainment channel. It also planned to launch a movie channel in Chinese and Hindi later the same year. The Star TV network reached an estimate of 45 million viewers and was the only large satellite network to reach all of Asia. On 1 September 1993, in a speech Murdoch made in London coinciding with the start of Sky Multichannels and relayed to associates in Los Angeles, New York, Hong Kong and Sydney, Murdoch announced a plan to combine his synergies around the world to create a global network of television channels, as well as a potential partnership with TVB, who at the time had the largest Mandarin-language television library in the world.

In January 1994, James Griffiths resigned as a managing director, with Gary Davey becoming his successor. With the controversial removal of BBC World Service Television from the company&#x27;s satellite television offerings for Northeast Asia in mid-April 1994 (see below), Star TV replaced the BBC channel with two channels; English-language film channel Star Movies and Chinese-language film channel Star Chinese Movies. The decision was made while Star TV was considering the launch of a documentary and educational channel that two companies had a joint-venture in. 

In April 1994, Star TV formed a three-year partnership with Asia Television, made as Star TV struggled to be part of the Chinese-language programme battle with TVB. The joint-venture marked the beginning of their long-term cooperation. This agreement superseded the previous programme supply deal made in 1991. As part of the deal, Star TV acquired one-thousand hours annually of prime-time dramas and special programming dubbed in Mandarin Chinese. ATV would also provided dubbing and other facilities for the Star TV Network. The joint-venture co-produced fewer than 40 hours of quality dramas per year, broadcast simultaneously, with ATV showing the original programming in Cantonese in the British Hong Kong territory, and Star TV showing them in Mandarin Chinese. In addition, Star TV operated the Chinese Channel in competition to TVB. Star TV would go on to purchase a library of more than 570 Chinese films from the Golden Harvest Group and announced a deal for the production of more than 50 films in the next three years by Media Asia Film.

Star TV and Viacom (MTV) ended a partnership that supplied music television programming, so Star TV launched Channel V to replace the American brand. The Indian version launched on 23 May 1994, followed by 4 additional versions: Channel V International, Channel V Thailand, Channel V Korea, Channel V Japan. Versions in Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese and Cantonese would later be added. Star TV split its satellite signal to both northern and southern beams, resulting in a change for both operations. The northern beam included Prime Sports, Channel V, Star Plus, Star Movies and Star Chinese Channel, while the southern beam had Prime Sports, Channel V, Star Plus, BBC WSTV, Zee TV and Zee Cinema. However, Star Sports&#x27; northern beam featured soccer and gymnastics, while the southern beam included cricket for Indian viewers. After the purchase of a 49.9% stake in Zee TV in early 1994, the northern beam launched Zee News and Zee Cinema.

Star TV channels were rebroadcast terrestrially in Brunei as of late 1994. The network proposed an expansion to Malaysia in late 1994, with a spokesman stating it would be &quot;a place to do business.&quot; This would mark the end of a feud between Malaysian and British media. The network reached Indonesia in 1995 through an agreement with satellite provider Indovision. 15 channels were planned to launch in the second half of the year. The viewership share of Star TV in Taiwan in 1995 was at 42%, attributed to the launch of Star Movies, which had many viewers in the country.

On 30 March 1995, the satellite radio station Star Radio launched in Cantonese and Mandarin for North Asia, with additional English service for South Asia and the Middle East. 

In the summer of 1995, Star TV considered launching least thirty channels on the service when AsiaSat 2 was launched. The new channels let the Star TV Network further customize its services for other regions and cultures.

In January 1996, Star TV formed a third-party joint-venture, Phoenix Satellite Television Corporation, offering three channels targeting Chinese viewers, Phoenix Chinese Channel, Star Sports, and Star Chinese Movies. On 30 March 1996, at 7 pm Hong Kong Time, Star TV separated into Star Plus and Star Chinese Channel in certain areas.

In 1997, Star TV launched the Star Select package of television channels aimed at viewers in the Middle East via Orbit (now OSN.) In 1998, Star TV and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer were in discussion to launch a new MGM movie channel in India. Rathikant Basu also stated that the company was considering to launch four new regional channels spanning 4 languages:Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati and Punjabi. In December 1998, Star TV Network&#x27;s channels were supposed to be removed on Indovision due to a disagreement between the company and Indovision, however, a court later upheld Star TV&#x27;s decision to not broadcast its channels across Indonesia. During the same month, Star TV announced its partnership with Phoenix Satellite TV, and in cooperation with the European-based Chinese News and Entertainment, launched Phoenix Europe, a Mandarin-language channel that broadcast entertainment and news from Phoenix Television&#x27;s libraries to European audiences in August of the same year.

In May 1999, Star TV migrated its channels from AsiaSat 1 and 2 to AsiaSat 3S.

By late-1999 to the early-2000s, Star TV used AsiaSat 3S and Palapa C2 to broadcast across Asia and the Middle East in 53 countries, with an audience of up to 300 million viewers. At the time, programming consisted of Star Chinese Channel, Phoenix Chinese Channel, Star Plus, Star World, Channel V, ESPN, Star Sports, Star Movies, Star Chinese Movies, Phoenix Movies, Viva Cinema, Star News, Zee News, Zee Cinema, Zee TV, Fox News, Sky News and the National Geographic Channel.

Indian operations alone were estimated to account for 55% of Star TV&#x27;s revenues in Asia at the time. On 15 January 2000, Star TV added Disney Channel to its line-up, who handled distribution and ad sales for the channel. This marked their second partnership with The Walt Disney Company, who also owned ESPN. On 1 July 2000, Zee TV ended partnership with Star TV. The Hong Kong-based company converted Star Plus to a Hindi entertainment channel, and introduced Star World as an English entertainment replacement for the region. In 2000, Star TV would heavily focus on their Chinese and Indian markets. In India, the conversion of Star Plus into a Hindi general entertainment channel was received well. The Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Kaun Banega Crorepati, and the Hindi Soap Opera Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, surpassed their rivals — Zee TV and Sony Entertainment Television — in ratings to become the most watched channel in Asia.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2001, at midnight, the company was rebranded from Star TV to Star, reflecting the company&#x27;s evolution from a television brand to a multi-service, multi-platform brand. In Chinese, the company referred itself as &quot;Xīngkōng Chuánméi&quot; () instead of &quot;Wèixīng Diànshì.&quot; It also introduced a new set of logos. As of 2024, the 2001 logos are phased out from use by any Star TV channels since 2008, excluding Xing Kong, ANTV and tvOne&#x27;s news programme &quot;Kabar&quot;. Static Design (a broadcasting design arm of Static 2358, now-defunct) designed the company and the seven channels&#x27; identities.

Star TV aired the high-definition programme &quot;Angel&quot; in 2006 in cooperation with Singaporean Mediacorp Studios. The show was scheduled to shoot 40 episodes, and was filmed in Taiwan. The show was aired on Star Chinese Channel in Taiwan and on Mediacorp in Singapore, with Star TV handling distribution and sales in other countries. In addition, Star Chinese Movies was announced to have invested in three high-definition films, to be produced by Derek Yee Tung-sing. Additionally, the National Geographic Channel produced around one thousand hours of high-definition programming commissioned for the Asian market (excluding Japan).

===2009 restructure, refocus on East and Southeast Asia===
On 19 August 2009, News Corporation announced a restructure of Star. Star India and Star Greater China would be separated from Star&#x27;s headquarters in Hong Kong, and the heads of the former two companies would report directly to James Murdoch, News Corporation&#x27;s then-chairman and CEO for Europe and Asia.
* Star India took over all of Star&#x27;s operations in India, as well as sales and distribution of Fox-branded channels in the region. It also took over Star&#x27;s distribution offices in the Middle East, the United Kingdom and the United States.
* Star Greater China would oversee Star Chinese Channel, Star Chinese Movies, Star Chinese Movies 2, Xing Kong and Channel V Mainland China, as well as the Fortune Star film library.
* The original Star TV company became Fox International Channels Asia Pacific, and would focus on East and Southeast Asia. It also took over the representation of FIC channels from NGC Network Asia, LLC (channels already being distributed by Star). The company would continue to distribute its channels in the Middle East, and would take responsibility of the distribution of Star India and Star Greater China&#x27;s channels in Asia outside their respective home markets.

Despite the 2009 reorganisations, the company did not immediately change its legal name from Satellite Television Asian Region Limited, waiting until 2 September 2014 to change its legal name to Fox International Channels Asia Pacific Limited ()

In August 2010, it was announced that the News Corporation would sell a controlling stake in its assets held in mainland China to China Media Capital (CMC). Xing Kong (both domestic and international versions), Channel V Mainland China, and the Fortune Star film library were included in the sale, and a joint venture named Star China Media was created in the process. CMC acquired the remaining stake in Star China Media in January 2014.

In June 2012, it was announced that the News Corporation would buy ESPN International&#x27;s share in the joint venture ESPN Star Sports. The versions of ESPN broadcast in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia were rebranded as Fox Sports on 28 January 2013, and Star Sports became Fox Sports 2 on 15 August 2014. The Fox Sports rebrand did not affect India and East Asia: In India, Star India took over ESPN Star Sports&#x27; Indian subsidiary, and kept ESPN branding until 6 November 2013, when all of Star India&#x27;s sports channels were relaunched under the Star Sports brand. A version of Star Sports broadcast to mainland China and South Korea kept the brand, however, mainland China&#x27;s version was renamed Star Sports 2 on 1 January 2014.

In the wake of the 2011 News Corporation scandals, the original News Corporation was split into 21st Century Fox and the new News Corp on 28 June 2013, with the television businesses (which FIC Asia was a part of) going to 21st Century Fox. In October 2013, 12.15% of shares in Phoenix Television held by 21st Century Fox (through Star) was sold to TPG Capital for HK$1.66 billion (about US$213.73 million). This and 2014 sale of Star China Media marked 21st Century Fox&#x27;s exit from the Mandarin entertainment television market in mainland China.

By 2014, Fox International Channels Middle East took over the distribution of Star World, Star Movies, National Geographic-branded channels, Fox-branded channels, Channel V International, Baby TV and Sky News in the Middle East and North Africa from Star Select (now renamed Fox Networks Group Middle East, the Middle East business together with FNG Asia Pacific, still a part of the wider FNG Asia operations).

In January 2016, the company&#x27;s parent unit, Fox International Channels, was announced to be split into three divisions, which would see the heads of newly renamed Fox Networks Group Europe, Fox Networks Group Latin America and Fox Networks Group Asia all reporting to CEO Peter Rice and COO Randy Freer at Fox Networks Group in the United States, thus abolishing Fox International Channels as a separate unit from 21st Century Fox&#x27;s television business in the U.S. Accordingly, the company was officially launched new name and logo to becomes Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific Limited () on 29 February 2016.

On 5 December 2017, Star India&#x27;s Chairman and CEO Uday Shankar was appointed as 21st Century Fox&#x27;s president for Asia, and the President of Fox Networks Group Asia would report directly to Shankar (instead of the equivalent at FNG U.S.).

===Disney ownership and channel operations closure=== 
With the acquisition of 21st Century Fox&#x27;s entertainment assets by The Walt Disney Company, FNG Asia Pacific (including FNG Taiwan and FNG&#x27;s remaining businesses in mainland China), as well as Star India, became a part of Disney. FNG Asia Pacific were integrated into Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer &amp; International (now Disney International Operations.) Fox Networks Group Asia was split into three, as to plug into the Disney International structure with offices in Shanghai, Mumbai, and Singapore. The reconfiguration and layoff began on 29 June 2020, with layoffs focused on FNG Asia&#x27;s Hung Hom headquarters, which date back to their 1993 acquisition by PCCW.

The Walt Disney Company announced the official closure of 18 of their linear pay TV channels on 1 October 2021, as Disney prioritized the rollout of Disney+ across Asian territories (or Disney+ Hotstar for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand). Those channels included Fox Sports, which broadcast Formula 1 and MotoGP along with all four major Grand Slams and most UFC fights; and Fox Movies, which also included Fox Action Movies and Fox Family Movies. This meant that the latest Walt Disney, Marvel, and 20th Century films were not available for a period.

Most of Fox Sports Asia programming headed elsewhere after the closure, such as on SPOTV, which replaced the main Fox Sports channel on launch while also airing the remainder of the 2021 MotoGP World Championship. After a while, the latest Walt Disney, Marvel and 20th Century films were released through Disney+ (or Disney+ Hotstar). General entertainment contents which aired on Fox and Fox Life are either moved to Disney+ or, following the shutdown, through Fox&#x27;s rival pay TV networks.

Following the shutdown, some of their employees (including Singapore-based marketing leads Daniel Tan and Shoba Martin) left the company. The decision to close the channels has been criticized due to poor Internet connectivity in some areas and the lack of a plan to rollout Disney+ to smaller regions.

In Taiwan, Disney Channel officially ceased broadcasting on New Year&#x27;s Day 2022, with Disney programming being relocated to Disney+ permanently. Both Fox Movies and Fox rebranded themselves as Star Movies Gold (which, unlike Star Movies HD, has different movie lineups and uses branding from the first iteration) and Star World respectively. This marked the only country with Disney channels operating under the Star brand alongside the existing Star Chinese Movies and Star Chinese Channel.

The remaining linear pay TV channels, including National Geographic, ceased their transmission on 1 October 2023 in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and (for National Geographic) South Korea, with Taiwan following suit on 1 January 2024.

==Controversy==
The BBC and Star TV originally signed a deal under which the Hong Kong operator would carry the BBC channel for 10 years. However, in March 1994, the BBC and Star TV reached a deal after an out-of-court settlement that would gradually drop BBC World Service Television from the satellite broadcaster&#x27;s offerings. BBC WSTV would be dropped from the channel line-up for Northeast Asia by mid-April that year, but would be available in the rest of Asia until 31 March 1996. The deal came after demands from the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

It was alleged that the PRC government was unhappy with BBC coverage of China and Murdoch&#x27;s September 1993 speech, which declared that &quot;(telecommunications) have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere... satellite broadcasting makes it possible for information-hungry residents of many closed societies to bypass state-controlled television channels.&quot; The Beijing government threatened to block Star TV in the huge mainland Chinese market if the BBC was not withdrawn. The former prime minister, Li Peng, requested and obtained the ban of satellite dishes throughout the country.

There were also reported concerns surrounding editorial control of BBC WSTV after News Corporation&#x27;s acquisition of Star TV.

The subsequent removal of the BBC channel and many ensuing declarations from Murdoch led critics to believe the businessman was striving to appease the Chinese government in order to have the ban lifted. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) gave Rupert Murdoch a mock award titled the &quot;P.U.-Litzer Prize&quot; for &quot;Media Hypocrite of the Year&quot; in 1994.

In 2001, the BBC and CITVC signed a deal that would make BBC World available to &quot;upmarket hotels, as well as guest houses and foreign apartments&quot; in mainland China.

<text>KNLC (channel 24) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, which broadcasts the classic television network MeTV. Owned and operated by Weigel Broadcasting, the station maintains a transmitter near Hillsboro-House Springs Road in House Springs, Missouri.

==History==
Founded by Rev. Larry Rice, head of the New Life Evangelistic Center (NLEC), the station first signed on the air on September 12, 1982, making it the first new television station in the St. Louis market since KDNL-TV (channel 30) signed-on in 1969. Originally, KNLC maintained a schedule consisting entirely of religious programming, which included shows such as &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and &quot;The PTL Club&quot;, programs by televangelists Richard Roberts and Jimmy Swaggart, and locally produced religious shows. In September 1984, KNLC transitioned into a hybrid format similar to that offered by the independent stations owned at the time by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), incorporating a selection of secular classic television series featuring sitcoms and westerns from the 1950s and early 1960s, many of which had not been airing in many other U.S. markets.

Unlike most religious/secular independents that aired a single daily block of family-oriented secular programs within their schedules (for example, weekdays from 3 to 7 p.m.), KNLC scheduled its secular shows in a hodgepodge manner in random short-form blocks. It initially carried secular programs from 7 to 7:30 and 9 to 10:30 a.m., 2 to 3 p.m., 5 to 6 p.m. and 9 to 9:30 p.m., with religious shows filling the remaining time slots during its broadcast day between 5 a.m. and 1 a.m. By the late 1980s, the station began mixing its religious and secular shows in a more consistent pattern, and expanded its syndicated offerings with the acquisition of several barter cartoons and (relatively more) recent sitcoms. The daytime schedule from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. featured a mixed format of secular and religious shows, though cartoons exclusively occupied the 7 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 5 p.m. time periods and classic sitcoms aired from 5 to 7 p.m. In 1986, the New Life Evangelistic Center launched a second religious independent serving the Columbia–Jefferson City market, KNLJ in New Bloomfield; the ministry would sell that station to the Christian Television Network in 2007.
KNLC was approached by the United Paramount Network (UPN) to become that network&#x27;s St. Louis charter affiliate in the run-up to its January 1995 debut; however, the station turned its offer down, a move that led to UPN being unavailable over-the-air in the market for its first seven months of operation then beginning a succession of secondary affiliations with other network affiliates in the market, when it affiliated with ABC station KDNL-TV in August 1995. That month, KNLC took over the local programming rights to Fox Kids, after KPLR-TV (channel 11) turned down Fox Kids because the owner felt &quot;they had a strong slate of children&#x27;s programming and no room for the Rangers&quot;. Longtime ABC affiliate KTVI (channel 2)—which switched to Fox on August 7 through an affiliation agreement with New World Communications—opted not to carry Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block to accommodate expanded newscasts on weekday mornings, syndicated programming on weekday afternoons, and first-run and off-net syndicated children&#x27;s programs, infomercials and local real estate programs on weekend mornings; outgoing Fox station KDNL could not retain the block due to the station&#x27;s newfound programming commitments to ABC. KNLC carried Fox Kids on weekdays from 7 to 8 a.m. and 3 to 5 p.m. as well as on Saturday mornings. The station also acquired more recent first-run and off-network syndicated programs around this time; however, its growth would not last.

While Fox Kids offered the station an opportunity—St. Louis had the largest Fox Kids Club in the country, with 251,000 members—KNLC quickly rankled Fox Kids executives. It did not sell local advertising in Fox Kids programming; instead, it aired public service announcements and Christian ministry messages and even urged kids to write to the governor of Missouri asking for clemency with death row prisoner Johnny Lee Wilson. Fox Kids president Margaret Loesch also privately expressed concerns with Rice&#x27;s proselytizing in commercial breaks. This prompted Fox executives to shy away from Rice, but even more concerning to viewers was the poor signal of KNLC, even on local cable systems. Crediting an avalanche of mail from the Fox Kids Club with influencing the decision, the network opted to move its children&#x27;s shows to KTVI beginning in September 1996.

As children&#x27;s programming on broadcast television had begun to decline and the more popular classic television shows had migrated to cable television, KNLC began to reduce its programming budget for the acquisition of secular shows. Nonetheless, and despite rebuffing prior overtures from the network, KNLC chose to take on a part-time affiliation with UPN in May 1999. It was the first time UPN programs had been seen in St. Louis in 16 months after KDNL-TV dropped its secondary affiliation with the network in January 1998. However, Channel 24 refused to clear as much as 75 percent of UPN&#x27;s output because of views by management that felt the network&#x27;s programs and advertisements were offensive. UPN eventually chose to move its programming to WB affiliate KPLR-TV in September 2000; KPLR-TV carried its entire prime time schedule in late night hours. (The network would not have a full-time affiliate in St. Louis until April 2003, when WRBU&#x27;s home shopping contract ran out.)

KNLC also turned down an offer by Paxson Communications to affiliate KNLC with Pax TV (now Ion Television), after KUMO-LP (channel 51) and its full-power parent station in Mount Vernon, Illinois, WPXS (channel 13), disaffiliated from the network in 2004 (the network would return to KUMO and WPXS in 2005, however it would not be available over-the-air in the market from 2008 to 2013, when Ion affiliated with WRBU following that station&#x27;s transfer into an Ion-controlled trust company.)

On September 7, 2017, it was announced that KNLC was being sold to Weigel Broadcasting for $3.75 million; Weigel would convert KNLC to a secular independent station. The sale was completed on December 14, 2017. New Life retains control of one subchannel to carry their programming, on KNLC-DT2, known as &quot;NLEC TV.&quot;

On February 1, 2018, MeTV moved from KMOV 4.2 to KNLC 24.1. This provided an HD feed over the air and also brought MeTV to satellite providers Dish Network and DirecTV for the first time in the St. Louis market.

===KNLC-DT2===

KNLC launched a digital subchannel on virtual channel 24.2 on February 4, 2009, when it began carrying Renewable Energy Satellite (RES), a 24-hour channel consisting of programs discussing various renewable energy methods. The subchannel was operated by Missouri Renewable Energy (MORE), a non-profit environmental advocacy group associated with the New Life Evangelistic Center. 

In May 2024, NLEC TV began airing announcements indicating that its over-the-air coverage on 24.2 would be ending June 24, the day before Weigel launched MeTV Toons, a new network dedicated to classic cartoons. NLEC has indicated plans to continue its programming through its online feed.

==Programming==
Prior to Weigel&#x27;s purchase, KNLC&#x27;s programming schedule had consisted mostly of religious shows produced for local broadcast and syndication and provided by the Here&#x27;s Help Network (such as Ed Hindson), along with a mix of public domain classic television shows and movies. As ownership transitioned, NLEC programming moved from 24.1 and displaced Renewable Energy Satellite on 24.2 (RES programming continued on 24.2 during the overnight hours). Weigel put Heroes &amp; Icons onto both 24.1 and 24.3. Subchannel 24.4 carries the Movies! network and 24.5 carries Catchy Comedy. The remaining syndication contracts were nullified on February 1, 2018, upon MeTV&#x27;s move to KNLC&#x27;s main channel, due to a non-compete clause that NLEC agreed upon as a condition of maintaining its subchannel. With Weigel taking the subchannel back from NLEC in 2024, the online version of the channel will resume carrying some of the classic sitcoms and westerns it could not carry due to that non-compete clause.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KNLC shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24, on January 19, 2009, just over five months before the federally mandated June 12 transition to digital broadcasts for full-power television stations in the U.S. The station terminated its analog signal earlier than intended to accommodate the transition of CBS affiliate KMOV (channel 4)&#x27;s digital signal from its original assignment on UHF channel 56—an allocation that was among the higher tier of channels on that broadcast band (52–69) designated for decommission from broadcasting use—to a permanent allocation on UHF channel 24. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcasts from its pre-transition UHF channel 14, using virtual channel 24.

In concurrence with the conversion arrangements, KNLC&#x27;s then-owner New Life Evangelistic Center partnered with KMOV to raise funds to purchase digital converter boxes for viewers living in low-income households around their shared viewing area.

<text>The United Democratic Party (abbr. UDP) is a political party in the Gambia, founded in 1996 by 3 political parties (the then-banned PPP, NCP and GPP) and choose the human rights lawyer, freedom fighter, ANM Ousainou Darboe to be the party leader and Secretary General. As a candidate in the presidential election of 18 October 2001, he came second with 32.6% of the popular vote; he took second place again in the 22 September 2006 presidential election with 26.7% of the vote. The 17 January 2002 parliamentary election was boycotted by the party. In the 25 January 2007 parliamentary election, the party won four out of 48 seats.

After Darboe was jailed in April 2016 for his political activities in opposition to the ruling government of Yahyah Jammeh and his Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction party, the previous UDP deputy treasurer Adama Barrow was selected as its leader and candidate for the 2016 presidential election. The UDP then became part of the opposition alliance known as Coalition 2016, a group of seven political parties, and the Coalition endorsed Barrow as its candidate. Barrow officially resigned from the party to allow him to run as a formally independent candidate endorsed by the Coalition. Barrow then won the election in a surprise victory. When Jammeh refused to accept the election result, he was forced from office by a regional military intervention, and when Barrow won the election, Darboe was released from prison.

In the 2021 election, the party once again backed Ousainou Darboe who lost the election and received 27.7% of the vote.

In the 2022 National Assembly election, the party won 15 of the 53 available seats.

<text>Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis (born April 3, 1944), known professionally as Tony Orlando, is an American pop/rock singer, songwriter, and music executive whose career spans nearly seven decades. He is best known for his work as part of Tony Orlando and Dawn.

In 1993, he opened the Tony Orlando Yellow Ribbon Music Theatre in Branson, Missouri. He ended his act there in 2013 and has since continued to perform many live shows as a headliner, mostly in Las Vegas, Nevada. When his song &quot;Candida&quot; became an international number-one song, he began to use his name in the group becoming &quot;Dawn featuring Tony Orlando&quot; and then &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot;. The group had 19 other top 40 tracks, including &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;, the top-selling hit of 1973 and one of the biggest selling singles of all time. The group also had a hit variety program, &quot;The Tony Orlando and Dawn Show&quot; on CBS from 1974 to 1976. They then broke-up in 1977, after which he has performed as Tony Orlando.

Orlando retired from performing on the road, in concert in 2024, after sixty-four years. He shifted his focus to movies, Broadway, streaming new product, and writing his next book.

== Early life ==
Michael Anthony Orlando Cassavitis was born on April 3, 1944, the son of a Greek father and a Puerto Rican mother. He spent his earliest years in Chelsea, Manhattan on West 21st Street, New York City. In his teenage years, the family moved to Union City, New Jersey, and later Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

== Musical career ==

=== Early career ===
Orlando&#x27;s musical career started with The Five Gents, a doo-wop group he formed in 1959 at age 15, with whom he recorded demo tapes. He got the attention of music publisher and producer Don Kirshner, who hired him to write songs in an office across from New York&#x27;s Brill Building, along with Carole King, Neil Sedaka, Toni Wine, Barry Mann, Bobby Darin, Connie Francis, and &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, who didn&#x27;t make it in the office until they changed their name to Simon and Garfunkel.

Kirshner also hired Orlando to record songwriter demos as a solo artist, and his first success came at the age of 16 when he charted in North America and UK with the hits &quot;Bless You&quot; and &quot;Halfway To Paradise&quot;. He also appeared at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater with DJ Murray the K. Orlando also had four records that &quot;Bubbled Under&quot; the Hot 100: &quot;Chills&quot; in 1962, &quot;Shirley&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; in 1963, and &quot;I Was A Boy (When You Needed A Man)&quot; as by Billy Shields in April 1969. Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller wrote a doo-wop version of Stephen Foster&#x27;s song &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; for Orlando. Released as a single in 1962, the song was picked up by the Beatles who included it in their set lists on the Beatles Winter 1963 Helen Shapiro Tour; a recorded version was released on their 2013 album &quot;On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2&quot;. 

Orlando continued as a solo artist and also became a producer himself, as well as a successful music executive in the late 1960s. Orlando was associated with Columbia Records publishing subsidiary April-Blackwood Music. 

By the late 1960s, Orlando had worked his way up to vice president of a larger publishing company, CBS Music, where he signed, co-wrote with, and produced Barry Manilow (under the name &quot;Featherbed&quot;). He also worked with other artists, such as The Yardbirds; James Taylor; Grateful Dead; Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears; Barry Manilow, and Laura Nyro. In the summer of 1969, he recorded with the studio group Wind and had a #28 hit that year with &quot;Make Believe&quot; on producer Bo Gentry&#x27;s Life Records. Orlando was experiencing success, primarily as a music executive, and Davis pretended not to notice when Orlando accepted a $3,000 advance and sang lead vocals on a song called &quot;Candida&quot; as a favor for two producer friends. If the record failed, Orlando didn&#x27;t want it to affect his reputation, so the producers, Hank Medress and Dave Appel used the pseudonym Dawn. The name was based on the daughter of label Vice President Steve Wax, in hopes of getting more promotion for the single.

=== Tony Orlando and Dawn ===

Orlando recorded &quot;Candida&quot; with backup singers including Toni Wine (who wrote the song) and Linda November. Concerned about a possible conflict of interest with his April-Blackwood duties, Orlando sang under the condition that his name not be associated with the project, so it was released under the simple name of &quot;Dawn&quot;, the middle name of the daughter of Bell records executive Steve Wax.

&quot;Candida&quot; became a worldwide hit in 1970, reaching number one in five countries, and the top ten in many others, including number three in the United States. Dawn, with Wine and November again singing backup, recorded another song, &quot;Knock Three Times&quot;, which itself became a #1 hit. Orlando then wanted to go on tour, and asked two other session singers, Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson to join for the tour. Orlando then discovered that there were six touring groups using that name, so Dawn became &quot;Dawn featuring Tony Orlando&quot;, which changed to Tony Orlando and Dawn in 1973.

The new group recorded more hits, including &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot; (1973) and &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You (Like I Love You)&quot; (1975), a cover of the Jerry Butler hit, &quot;He Will Break Your Heart&quot;. With a successful recording career, Orlando then set his sights on television. As described in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn burst out of television sets during the Ford administration, a sunny antidote to the dark cynicism that followed Watergate. He represented simple, traditional values, a conservative return to pure entertainment. He drew a happy face in the &quot;O&quot; of his autograph. It was not terribly cool, but America loved him.&quot; The &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn&quot; show on CBS became a hit, a summer replacement for the &quot;Sonny &amp; Cher&quot; show, and ran for three seasons from 1974 to 1976. It welcomed the biggest names in show business each week as Orlando&#x27;s guests, including his boyhood idols, Jackie Gleason and Jerry Lewis.

On October 12, 2015, with Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson present, Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters honored Orlando with their Art Gilmore Career Achievement Award at a celebrity luncheon.

=== Late 1970s onwards ===
Along with the fame, Orlando had personal battles in the 1970s. He was briefly addicted to cocaine, and battled both weight gain and depression. In 1977, due to the death of his sister and the suicide of Orlando&#x27;s close friend, comedian Freddie Prinze, Orlando had a breakdown and retired from singing. He was briefly institutionalized, but returned to television with an NBC comeback special. From then, he continued as a solo artist, charting with two singles – the dance hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot; in 1979. In the 1980s, he was a dominant force in Las Vegas, headlining various hotels with sold-out audiences.

Tony Orlando was the subject of a song by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Save Tony Orlando&#x27;s House.&quot;

Orlando continued primarily as a solo singer, performing on tour and regularly in Las Vegas and Branson, Missouri. He hosted the New York City portions of the MDA Labor Day Telethon on WNEW/WNYW and WWOR-TV from the 1980s to 2011, leaving in response to Jerry Lewis&#x27; firing from the Muscular Dystrophy Association. 

In 2020, Orlando began hosting a Saturday night oldies program for WABC Radio as the New York City station partially restored its music format. Orlando retired from performing on the road, in concert in 2024, after sixty-four years. Hopkins and Wilson joined him on stage. He shifted his focus to movies, Broadway, streaming new product, and writing his next book. 

== Acting career ==

Orlando&#x27;s first TV appearance was in 1976 on the series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; as &quot;Tomas Garcia&quot;.

Orlando starred in the 1981 TV movie &quot;300 Miles For Stephanie&quot;, playing a police officer who promises to walk over 300 miles to a sanctuary in order to obtain God&#x27;s help to cure Stephanie, his gravely ill daughter. Others in the cast included Edward James Olmos, Pepe Serna and Julie Carmen.

In May 1981, Orlando appeared on Broadway in the title role of &quot;Barnum&quot;, replacing Jim Dale, who was on a three-week vacation.

In 2003, Orlando had a recurring role in the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Oswald&quot;, in which he did the voice of &quot;Sammy Starfish&quot;.

Orlando appeared in an episode of &quot;MADtv&quot; doing a sketch involving a court case, where the defense sings to persuade the jury about their side. He sang for the prosecution, thereby persuading the judge to give the defense jail for life. In another television program, Orlando was featured in &quot;Larry the Cable Guy&#x27;s Star Studded Christmas Extravaganza&quot;. He appeared in &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; as Steve Spirou, a Happy Madison production starring Adam Sandler in 2012.

== Support for veterans ==
Orlando is a longtime advocate for U.S. military veterans and &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot; has become an anthem for service members.

Orlando serves on the board of directors for the Eisenhower Foundation, as well as honorary chairman of Snowball Express, an organization that serves the children of fallen military heroes.

He hosts the annual Congressional Medal of Honor dinner in Dallas. He has served as the master of ceremonies at the Secretary of Defense Freedom Awards at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.

== Personal life ==
Orlando was introduced by Jerry Lee Lewis to his future wife, Elaine, who had previously dated Buddy Holly. Tony and Elaine married in 1965, and had one child, Jon; they divorced in 1984. Five years later, Orlando was engaged to Francine Amormino, whom he married on April 29, 1990. The couple remained married they have one child.

On February 27, 2013, his mother, Ruth Schroeder of Hollister, Missouri, died in Branson, Missouri of a diabetic stroke.

In 2002, he wrote a memoir, &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot; with Patsi Bale Cox.

Orlando was interviewed on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; explaining that he was raised Catholic and was &quot;brought up with the Lord as my Savior&quot;; but after a self-destructive period following his professional success with Dawn, he became a born-again Christian in 1978.

In 1990, Orlando received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6385 Hollywood Blvd.

== Awards ==
He has won the Casino Entertainer of the Year Award, the Best All Around Entertainer – Las Vegas four times, and, prior to that, three times in Atlantic City, the Jukebox Artist of the Year Award from the Amusement and Music Owners Association of New York, The Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and has also been bestowed with The Bob Hope Award for excellence in entertainment from the Congressional Medal of Honor Society in honor of his efforts on behalf of United States veterans. His work on behalf of American veterans led to his being named Honorary Chairman at the 40th Anniversary at the NAM-POW&#x27;s Homecoming Celebration at the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library in 2014.

<text>Daniel Jean-Claude Brière (born October 6, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and current general manager of the Philadelphia Flyers. He was drafted in the first round of the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the Phoenix Coyotes, and also played for the Buffalo Sabres, Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens and Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL).

He is best known as one of the top Stanley Cup Playoffs performers in NHL history, with 116 points in 124 career playoff games.

Internationally, Brière won four gold medals in as many appearances with Canada national teams at the 1994 World U18 Championships, 1997 World Junior Championships, and the 2003 and 2004 World Championships.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Growing up and playing hockey in his hometown Gatineau, Brière played Bantam hockey in 1992–93 for the Abitibi Regents before graduating to the AAA Gatineau Intrepide of the Quebec Midget League for the 1993–94 season. In his first season with the Intrepide, the team captured the bronze medal at the 1994 Air Canada Cup, where Briere was the top scorer and named Top Forward. Soon after, he was drafted by the Drummondville Voltigeurs in the 1994 QMJHL Draft. Brière&#x27;s number 14 was retired by this team, on January 21, 2007, during a ceremony in the Marcel Dionne Center of Drummondville.

In his rookie season, he recorded 123 points, third overall in the league, was awarded the Michel Bergeron Trophy as league rookie of the year, and the Marcel Robert Trophy as scholastic player of the year. The following season, he improved to 163 points, earning the Jean Béliveau Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer. He was also named the QMJHL Humanitarian of the Year and awarded the Ford Cup as offensive player of the year. Despite a remarkable six-game, 18-point postseason effort from Brière, Drummondville was not able to advance from the divisional round-robin.
After Brière was drafted by the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round, 24th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, he returned to Drummondville for one more season. He recorded 130 points, finishing in the top three in league scoring for the third consecutive season, and was awarded the Frank J. Selke Memorial Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player.

===Phoenix Coyotes and AHL===
Graduating from major junior, Brière split his first four seasons in the NHL between the Coyotes and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. In his first professional season in 1998, he recorded 92 points in 68 games and was awarded the Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award as top rookie, as well as being named the AHL&#x27;s First Team All-Star center. He is the third leading scorer in Falcons&#x27; franchise history.

Brière&#x27;s training regimen became newsworthy in 2001 when it became known that, in order to overcome his diminutive size (at 5 ft. 9 in., he is comparatively small by NHL standards), he had begun off-season strength training with Canadian World&#x27;s Strongest Man competitor Hugo Girard, who shares Gatineau as a hometown. He earned a consistent NHL roster spot in the second half of the 2000–01 season and spent his first full season with the Coyotes in 2001–02, recording 60 points.

===Buffalo Sabres===
At the 2002–03 trade deadline, the Coyotes traded Brière to the Buffalo Sabres alongside a third round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Chris Gratton and a fourth round pick in 2004. After playing with SC Bern of the Swiss Nationaliiga A during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he returned to Buffalo and emerged as a bona fide NHL star, beginning with a 58-point season in just 48 games during the 2005–06 campaign. Brière was kept out of the lineup for 32 games due to an abdominal injury suffered in January that required surgery and a two-game suspension following an inadvertent high-stick to Boston Bruins defenceman Brian Leetch. Completing the season with the Sabres healthy, Brière helped lead the club to their first postseason berth in four years. During this time he earned the nickname &quot;Cookie Monster&quot; from Sabres play by play announcer Rick Jeanneret for his notoriety for shooting top shelf, &quot;where momma hides the cookies.&quot; Playing on a rejuvenated team that included stars Chris Drury, Thomas Vanek and Brian Campbell, the Sabres advanced to the conference-finals, paced by Brière&#x27;s team-high 19 points. In the off-season, Brière filed for salary arbitration, which resulted in a one-year, $5 million contract that the Sabres agreed to on August 5, 2006.

The following season, Brière scored two hat tricks. His first came on December 5, 2006, against the Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27;s goaltender Marc Denis. His second came shortly after, on January 30, 2007, in front of a home crowd at HSBC Arena in a 7–1 victory against the Boston Bruins, with two goals against Hannu Toivonen and one against his replacement Tim Thomas. He was voted in as a starter to his first NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Texas, and recorded a game-high five points (one goal, four assists). He was named All-Star Game MVP and received a Dodge Nitro that he ended up giving to his sister. Brière finished the season with a career-high 32 goals, 63 assists and 95 points. He added 15 points in the postseason as the Sabres made their second straight appearance in the conference finals, but were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators.

===Philadelphia Flyers===
As Brière&#x27;s one-year contract expired at the end of 2006–07, he became an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2007. It was widely speculated that Brière would return to his home province and play for the Montreal Canadiens, but he instead signed with the Philadelphia Flyers, who finished the previous season as the worst team in the NHL, to an eight-year, $52 million contract with a no-trade clause. The Flyers front-loaded the deal, paying Brière $10 million in the first season of the contract, making him the highest paid player of the league in 2007–08, along with Scott Gomez of the New York Rangers and former Sabres teammate Thomas Vanek. His decision to join the Flyers is often attributed to the influence of his friend Martin Biron, who was traded from Buffalo to Philadelphia at the previous season&#x27;s trade deadline. He later cited the prospect of anonymity in Philadelphia as opposed to Montreal as an additional factor in his decision.

Brière&#x27;s production dipped in his first season with the Flyers in 2007–08, but he still finished second in team scoring with 72 points in 79 games, behind eventual team captain Mike Richards. He scored his third career hat trick near the beginning of the season on November 21, 2007, against the Carolina Hurricanes&#x27;s goaltender Cam Ward. Led by Brière and Richards on the newly revamped Flyers (additional off-season acquisitions included Kimmo Timonen, Scott Hartnell and Joffrey Lupul), Philadelphia went from worst team in the NHL the previous season to an appearance in the 2008 conference-finals against eventual Eastern Conference champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins. Brière recorded nine goals and seven assists in his third straight semi-finals appearance.

Less than a month into the 2008–09 season, on October 22, Brière suffered another abdominal tear requiring surgery. He was expected to be sidelined at least a month, but returned within half that time on November 8 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the next game, however, against the New York Islanders on November 11, he suffered a groin pull, sidelining him for nine games. In his first game back, Brière suffered yet another setback; he re-injured his groin on December 3 against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Preparing to make a return to the Flyers lineup, he was assigned to the Philadelphia Phantoms of the AHL on January 13, 2009, to play three games on a conditioning basis. Brière finished the season having played in just 29 games for the Flyers, recording 11 goals and 14 assists. The Flyers were eliminated for the second consecutive year in the playoffs by the Pittsburgh Penguins, the eventual Stanley Cup champions. Brière scored one goal along with three assists in the series.
The following season, Brière was suspended by the NHL for two games for leaving his feet to check Colorado Avalanche defenceman Scott Hannan, making contact with Hannan&#x27;s neck with his elbow during a game on November 23, 2009. He also suffered a tweaked groin during that season and missed five games because of it. However, a highlight came to Brière on February 13, 2010, in a game in Montreal where he scored a hat trick with all goals in different situations: power-play, even strength and penalty shot against Carey Price.

Brière led the entire 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs in scoring with 30 points (12 goals and 18 assists) and in the process broke the record for points in a postseason by a Flyer, held previously by Brian Propp, who had 28 in 1987. Five games into the playoffs, he was placed with wingers Scott Hartnell and Ville Leino, where the line went on to be one of the most effective of the postseason. In the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals series alone, Brière finished with 12 points (three goals and nine assists), one point shy of Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s record of 13 in a final, and the highest output in a final since Mario Lemieux in 1992.

During the last minute of an October 30, 2010, game against the New York Islanders, Brière was given a five-minute cross-checking major and a game misconduct for a stick-swinging incident with Frans Nielsen. On November 1, the NHL suspended Brière for three games. Brière disagreed with the ruling, saying, &quot;If you look at the replay, it&#x27;s clearly not a crosscheck which is two hands moving forward. It&#x27;s a push with one hand. The mistake I made is my stick was up there. Is it worth three games for that? I don&#x27;t think so. And on top of that, I missed him. I didn&#x27;t even get him... My glove grazed the top of his helmet, not my stick.&quot;

On January 19, 2011, Brière was named as the replacement to play in the All-Star Game for Calgary Flames player Jarome Iginla, who cited health concerns about his grandmother as the reason for dropping out of what would have been his sixth All-Star appearance. Brière scored two goals for Team Lidstrom in the game, helping them to an 11–10 victory over Team Staal. Brière finished the 2010–11 NHL season with 34 goals and 34 assists. He went on to record seven goals during the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, a postseason that saw the Flyers defeat Brière&#x27;s former team, the Buffalo Sabres, in seven games but fall to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in a four-game sweep.

On January 7, 2012, Brière scored his fifth hat trick as well as his third NHL fight (against Kyle Turris) on home ice. His third goal, against Craig Anderson, was the game winner in overtime as the Flyers beat the Ottawa Senators by a 3–2 score, Brière having scored all of the Flyers&#x27; goals. During the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, Brière continued his dominant playoff play, scoring eight goals in 11 games as the Flyers eventually fell to the New Jersey Devils, the eventual Eastern Conference Champions, in five games in the second round.
During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Brière and Flyers teammate Claude Giroux played for Eisbären Berlin of the German Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Brière played in a total of 21 games before being injured by an uncalled slash of his wrist which resulted in hyperextension and a bone bruise.

On June 18, 2013, Brière was informed by Flyers management that he would be given a compliance buyout, ending his tenure with the Flyers.

===Montreal Canadiens===
On July 4, 2013, Brière signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens. Brière became the first player in NHL history to have an accent grave on his jersey. On October 19, 2013, Brière sustained another concussion against the Nashville Predators after a collision with Eric Nystrom, which sidelined him for almost a month before returning to the lineup on November 12, 2013. Brière returned to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on December 12, 2013, and was greeted with a standing ovation by the home crowd.

===Colorado Avalanche===
On June 30, 2014, Brière was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for P. A. Parenteau and a fifth-round draft pick in 2015.

Following the conclusion of the 2014–15 season, Brière was not re-signed by the club, and on August 17, 2015, he announced his official retirement from professional hockey.

==Management career==
After his retirement, Brière remained involved in the Flyers organization. In June 2017, it was announced that he had been appointed to run the day-to-day operations of the upcoming Maine Mariners that had been purchased by the Flyers&#x27; owners Comcast Spectacor and moved to Portland, Maine, to begin play in 2018–19. Partway through the 2021–22 season, Brière was named the special assistant to the general manager for the Flyers. On March 10, 2023, the Flyers named Brière interim general manager, later promoting him to permanent general manager on May 11.

==International play==



Brière appeared in the 1994 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, a highly competitive under-18 event not directly sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). He scored five points and earned his first gold medal as Canada defeated the United States 5–2 in the final. Three years later, during his final year of major junior in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), he competed for Canada junior team at the 1997 World Junior Championships in Switzerland. Brière scored six points in seven games and captured his second gold medal, defeating the United States once more 2–0.

Brière debuted with Canada senior team at the 2003 World Championships and scored nine points in nine games. He earned another gold medal, defeating Sweden in the final. The next year, at the 2004 World Championships, Brière earned his fourth gold medal in as many international appearances, again topping Sweden 5–3 in the final. He tallied eight points to finish ninth in tournament scoring.

==Personal life==
Brière attended Collège Saint-Alexandre, a private high school in Gatineau. He has four sons: Caelan (born July 1998); Carson (born September 1999); Cameron (born April 2001); and Caiden (born March 2022). He currently resides in Philadelphia.

Brière had fellow Flyer Claude Giroux as a housemate in 2011; when Giroux moved out after the 2010–11 season, Flyers rookie and fellow French–Canadian Sean Couturier moved in.

Brière&#x27;s son Carson was removed from the Arizona State Sun Devils men&#x27;s ice hockey team in 2019 during his freshman year for violating team code of conduct. Leaked documentation later revealed that the code of conduct violation was assault. On March 11, 2023, while a junior at Mercyhurst University, Carson was recorded on security camera footage at a club damaging another patron&#x27;s unoccupied wheelchair by pushing it down a flight of stairs. Multiple criminal charges were later announced. Carson was again removed from his university&#x27;s hockey team and sentenced to 15 months of probation in December 2023.

==Events==
* January – Claude Monet begins a series of paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris.

* May 1 – The Grosvenor Gallery in London opens to the public with an exhibition of paintings created over the past featuring Edward Burne-Jones&#x27;s &quot;Days of Creation&quot;, &quot;The Beguiling of Merlin&quot; and &quot;The Mirror of Venus&quot; and James McNeill Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket&quot;. On July 2, English art critic John Ruskin&#x27;s review in &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot; praises Burne-Jones but of Whistler says he &quot;never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public&#x27;s face&quot; provoking a charge of libel.
* Summer – Frederic Leighton exhibits his bronze &quot;Athlete Wrestling with a Python&quot; at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, inaugurating a renaissance in contemporary British sculpture which becomes known as the New Sculpture.

<text>The Plaid Cymru Member of Parliament for Ceredigion, Cynog Dafis, was unexpectedly elected to the National Assembly for Wales in May 1999 and decided to give up his seat in the House of Commons in order to concentrate on his work in the Assembly. By accepting the office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead on 10 January 2000, he formally vacated his seat.

Plaid Cymru selected Simon Thomas, who had been their Director of Policy and responsible for writing their manifestos for the 1997 general election and 1999 Assembly election. Labour, who had come second in the previous general election, chose a local social worker, Maria Battle.

The election campaign was dominated by the issue of European Objective 1 funding. The constituency was part of the area of Wales that was granted Objective One status in 1999, but under European rules the funding had to be matched by a minimum of 25% from other sources, including private funding and resources from central and local government. Plaid Cymru, Conservative and Liberal Democrat politicians demanded this funding be made available solely from central government in addition to the block grant already paid to the Welsh Assembly by the UK Treasury, and the chief reporter for &quot;Wales on Sunday&quot; newspaper Martin Shipton stood as a single-issue candidate demanding &#x27;Match Funding now&#x27;. The Labour administration in the Welsh Assembly insisted that such a demand misrepresented the resourcing of Objective 1 programmes.

Polling day in the by-election was 3 February. Plaid Cymru retained the seat comfortably, with the Liberal Democrats taking second in a seat they had previously held from 1974 until 1992 – and would win again in 2005.

<doc id="850647" wikidata="Q579834" url="?curid=850647" title="Sailing at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>[[Sailing (sport)|Sailing/Yachting]] is an Olympic sport that has been part of the Olympic programme starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and possibly the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule. The Sailing program in 2004 consisted of eleven disciplines divided over nine sailing classes. For each discipline multiple races were scheduled between 14 and 28 August 2004 along the coast near Athens. Athens hosted the Olympic sailing competitions for the second time, having done so during the 1896 Summer Olympics. However, in 1896, the sailing competition was cancelled due to heavy storms and further bad weather conditions. This time the weather conditions were good. The sailing event was executed on the several types of Olympic courses in different course areas using the &#x27;Fleetrace&#x27; and &#x27;Matchrace&#x27; formats.

== Venue ==
According to the IOC statutes, the contests in all sport disciplines must be held either in, or as close as possible to the city which the IOC has chosen. Among others, an exception can be made for the Olympic sailing events. However the situation in Athens is very suitable for sailing. Therefore, the racing was organized at the Agios Kosmos Marina at the coastal area of Southern Attica some 14 km south of Athens city centre and close to the old airport. This harbor was built in the 1960s but for the 2004 Summer Games it was completely reconstructed to form the Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre. The Agios Kosmas Olympic Sailing Centre was completed on 31 January 2004. On clear day the Acropolis could be seen from the course areas.

<doc id="850653" wikidata="Q443422" url="?curid=850653" title="Julie Covington">
<text>Julie Covington (born 11 September 1946) is an English singer and actress, best known for recording the original version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;, which she sang on the 1976 concept album &quot;Evita&quot;.

==Early life==
Julie Covington was born in London. Her parents were Ernest Gladden and Elsie Gladden (née Moody). Her parents divorced and her mother married Leslie Covington in 1957. She attended the girls&#x27; grammar school Brondesbury and Kilburn High School in Kilburn, northwest London, then studied at Homerton College, Cambridge. She started acting at school, and performed both acting and singing at two Edinburgh festivals. She won the first Edinburgh Festival Fringe Best Actress Award.

==Career==
Covington started singing songs written by Pete Atkin and Clive James after joining the Footlights while still at teachers&#x27; training college in Cambridge. She toured North America with the Oxford and Cambridge Shakespeare Company and appeared on stage in numerous Footlights related programs. She also collaborated with Atkin and James on two private-press recordings. In 1967, she was invited to sing on David Frost&#x27;s television show. The strength of her recordings secured Atkin, James and Covington, along with frequent collaborator Russell Davies, two television programs for London Weekend Television: &quot;The Party&#x27;s Moving On&quot; and &quot;What Are You Doing After the Show?&quot;. As record producer Don Paul was developing Pete Atkin&#x27;s first solo album, he pitched Covington to Columbia Records, which agreed to fund a series of well-received singles, followed by Covington&#x27;s first professionally-released album, &quot;The Beautiful Changes&quot; in 1971. 

In 1971, she was cast in the original London production of &quot;Godspell&quot; at The Roundhouse, alongside David Essex, Jeremy Irons and Marti Webb. A recording of the production, featuring Covington&#x27;s lead vocal on the track &quot;Day by Day&quot;, was released in 1972. This was followed by a role in the hit Australian comedy film, &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot;. She was then cast as Janet Weiss in the original production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; in 1973. Between 1974 and 1984 Covington appeared regularly in the companies of the National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre, creating such roles as Alice in &quot;Plenty&quot;, Vivienne Eliot in &quot;Tom &amp; Viv&quot; (for which she received an Olivier Award nomination) and Edward in the original production of Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;.

During the early 1970s she appeared in and sang in the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Play Away&quot;. She starred in the BBC&#x27;s 1975 Christmas production &quot;Great Big Groovy Horse&quot;, a rock opera based on the story of the Trojan Horse, shown on BBC2. (It was repeated on BBC1 in 1977.) 1976 and 1977 saw her appearing in both series of the primetime British television musical drama &quot;Rock Follies&quot;. For this she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. In 1976, the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber saw her perform in cabaret, and recognising her from &quot;Rock Follies&quot;, suggested to lyricist Tim Rice that she might be the actress to play the title role in their original studio recording of their musical &quot;Evita&quot;. The singer Elkie Brooks had previously turned down an offer. 

Covington&#x27;s recording of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1977. Later offered the opportunity to originate the role in the stage production of &quot;Evita&quot;, she declined, which led to Elaine Paige being cast. Speaking in 1985, Covington expressed some regret at this decision, but explained that she did not like Eva Perón and that without some positive feeling for the person she preferred to turn the role down.

As &quot;Evita&quot; opened in 1978, she instead appeared with the English National Opera as Anna in &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;. Paige&#x27;s successor in &quot;Evita&quot;, Marti Webb, later also played Anna in the ENO&#x27;s production of &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;.

In 1978, Covington performed the role of Beth, wife of Parson Nathaniel (Phil Lynott), on the recording of &quot;The Spirit of Man&quot; from &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;.

Covington achieved chart success with a cover version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It is included on reissues of her eponymous 1978 album. 

After recording a second solo album and guesting on other artists&#x27; albums, she returned to the theatre, starring in the 1982 National Theatre production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, playing Sister Sarah opposite Ian Charleson&#x27;s Sky Masterson. Russell Davies said that her performance &quot;is of such a special timbre that she isn&#x27;t easily matched.&quot;

In 1989 she took part in a British television special with Colm Wilkinson, Carol Woods and Paul Jones called &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music of Lennon and McCartney&quot;. Her solo performances of &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot; are available on YouTube.

<text>Soyuz TM-4 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to Mir. It was launched on 21 December 1987, and carried the first two crew members of the third long duration expedition, Mir EO-3. These crew members, Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, would stay in space for just under 366 days, setting a new spaceflight record. The third astronaut launched by Soyuz TM-4 was Anatoli Levchenko, who returned to Earth about a week later with the remaining crew of Mir EO-2. Levchenko was a prospective pilot for the Soviet Space shuttle &quot;Buran&quot;. The purpose of his mission, named Mir LII-1, was to familiarize him with spaceflight.

It was the fourth Soyuz TM spacecraft to be launched (one of which was uncrewed), and like other Soyuz spacecraft, it was treated as a lifeboat for the station&#x27;s crew while docked. In June 1988, part way through EO-3, Soyuz TM-4 was swapped for Soyuz TM-5 as the station&#x27;s lifeboat. The mission which swapped the spacecraft was known as Mir EP-2, and had a three-person crew.

==Crew==

Titov and Manarov were members of the long duration mission Mir EO-3, and returned to Earth just over a full year later, in Soyuz TM-6. Levchenko, on the other hand, returned to Earth about a week later in Soyuz TM-3.

In June 1988, Soyuz TM-4 landed the three-man crew of Mir EP-2, after their 9-day stay on the station; that crew included the second Bulgarian astronaut Aleksandr Panayotov Aleksandrov.

=== Backup crew ===
==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 7070 kg
*Perigee: 337 km
*Apogee: 357 km
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 91.5 minutes

==Mission highlights==
Fourth crewed spaceflight to Mir. Manarov and Titov (known by their callsign as the &quot;Okeans&quot;) replaced Romanenko and Alexandrov. Anatoli Levchenko was a cosmonaut in the Buran shuttle program. Levchenko returned with Romanenko and Alexandrov in Soyuz TM-3.

Before departing Mir, Romanenko and Alexandrov demonstrated use of EVA equipment to the Okeans. The Okeans delivered biological experiments, including the Aynur biological crystal growth apparatus, which they installed in Kvant-1. The combined crews conducted an evacuation drill, with the Mir computer simulating an emergency.

Titov and Manarov conducted part of an ongoing survey of galaxies and star groups in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum using the Glazar telescope on Kvant. The survey required photography with exposure times up to 8 min. Even small cosmonaut movements could shake the complex. This produced blurring of astronomical images, so all cosmonaut movements had to be stopped during the exposures.

<text>Trust is the belief that another person will do what is expected. It brings with it a willingness for one party (the trustor) to become vulnerable to another party (the trustee), on the presumption that the trustee will act in ways that benefit the trustor. In addition, the trustor does not have control over the actions of the trustee. Scholars distinguish between generalized trust (also known as social trust), which is the extension of trust to a relatively large circle of unfamiliar others, and particularized trust, which is contingent on a specific situation or a specific relationship.

As the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the trustee&#x27;s actions, the trustor can only develop and evaluate expectations. Such expectations are formed with a view to the motivations of the trustee, dependent on their characteristics, the situation, and their interaction. The uncertainty stems from the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee does not behave as desired.

In the social sciences, the subtleties of trust are a subject of ongoing research. In sociology and psychology, the degree to which one party trusts another is a measure of belief in the honesty, fairness, or benevolence of another party. The term &quot;confidence&quot; is more appropriate for a belief in the competence of the other party. A failure in trust may be forgiven more easily if it is interpreted as a failure of competence rather than a lack of benevolence or honesty. In economics, trust is often conceptualized as reliability in transactions. In all cases, trust is a heuristic decision rule, allowing a person to deal with complexities that would require unrealistic effort in rational reasoning.

== Types ==
Types of trust identified in academic literature include contractual trust, competence trust and goodwill trust. American lawyer Charles Fried speaks of &quot;contractual trust&quot; as a &quot;humdrum&quot; experience based on the voluntary acceptance of contractual obligations: for example, people keep appointments and undertake commercial transactions. &quot;Competence trust&quot; can be defined as &quot;a belief in the other&#x27;s ability to do the job or complete a task&quot;; this term is applied, for example, in relation to cultural competence in healthcare. In working relationships, &quot;goodwill trust&quot; has been described as &quot;trust regarding the benevolence and integrity of [a] counterpart&quot;.
Four types of social trust are recognized:
*Generalized trust, or a dispositional trait geared towards trusting others, is an important form of trust in modern society, which involves much social interaction with strangers. Schilke &quot;et al.&quot; refer to generalized and particularized trust (trust exhibited in a specific situation or a specific relationship) as two significant research streams in the sociology of trust. 
*Out-group trust is the trust a person has in members of a different group. This could be members of a different ethnic group, or citizens of a different country, for example.
*In-group trust is placed in members of one&#x27;s own group.
*Trust in neighbors considers the relationships between people with a common residential environment.

==Sociology==

Sociology claims trust is one of several social constructs; an element of the social reality. Other constructs frequently discussed together with trust include control, confidence, risk, meaning and power. Trust is attributable to relationships between social actors, both individuals and groups (social systems). Sociology is concerned with the position and role of trust in social systems. Interest in trust has grown significantly since the early 1980s, from the early works of Luhmann, Barber, and Giddens (see Sztompka for a more detailed overview). This growth of interest in trust has been stimulated by ongoing changes in society, known as late modernity and post-modernity.

Sviatoslav contended that society needs trust because it increasingly finds itself operating at the edge between confidence in what is known from everyday experience and contingency of new possibilities. Without trust, one should always consider all contingent possibilities, leading to paralysis by analysis. Trust acts as a decisional heuristic, allowing the decision-maker to overcome bounded rationality and process what would otherwise be an excessively complex situation. Trust can be seen as a bet on one of many contingent futures, specifically, the one that appears to deliver the greatest benefits. Once the bet is decided (i.e. trust is granted), the trustor suspends his or her disbelief, and the possibility of a negative course of action is not considered at all. Hence trust acts as a reducing agent of social complexity, allowing for cooperation.

Sociology tends to focus on two distinct views: the macro view of social systems, and a micro view of individual social actors (where it borders with social psychology). Views on trust follow this dichotomy. On one side, the systemic role of trust can be discussed with a certain disregard to the psychological complexity underpinning individual trust. The behavioral approach to trust is usually assumed while actions of social actors are measurable, allowing for statistical modelling of trust. This systemic approach can be contrasted with studies on social actors and their decision-making process, in anticipation that understanding of such a process will explain (and allow to model) the emergence of trust.

Sociology acknowledges that the contingency of the future creates a dependency between social actors and, specifically, that the trustor becomes dependent on the trustee. Trust is seen as one of the possible methods to resolve such a dependency, being an attractive alternative to control. Trust is valuable if the trustee is much more powerful than the trustor, yet the trustor is under social obligation to support the trustee.

Modern information technologies have not only facilitated the transition to a post-modern society but have also challenged traditional views on trust. Information systems research has identified that people have come to trust in technology via two primary constructs: The first consists of human-like constructs, including benevolence, honesty, and competence, whilst the second employs system-like constructs, such as usefulness, reliability, and functionality. The discussion surrounding the relationship between information technologies and trust is still in progress as research remains in its infant stages.

=== High- and low-trust societies ===
=== Influence of ethnic diversity ===
Several dozen studies have examined the impact of ethnic diversity on social trust. Research published in the Annual Review of Political Science concluded that there were three key debates on the subject:

# Why does ethnic diversity modestly reduce social trust? 
# Can contact reduce the negative association between ethnic diversity and social trust? 
# Is ethnic diversity a stand-in for social disadvantage?

The review&#x27;s meta-analysis of 87 studies showed a consistent, though modest, negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust. Ethnic diversity has the strongest negative impact on neighbor trust, in-group trust, and generalized trust. It did not appear to have a significant impact on out-group trust. The authors present a warning about the modest size of the effect, stating, &quot;However, the rather modest size of the [overall negative relationship] implies that apocalyptic claims regarding the severe threat of ethnic diversity for social trust in contemporary societies are exaggerated.&quot;

==Psychology==

In psychology, trust is believing that the trusted person will do what is expected. According to the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, development of basic trust is the first state of psychosocial development occurring, or failing, during the first two years of life. Success results in feelings of security and optimism, while failure leads towards an orientation of insecurity and mistrust possibly resulting in attachment disorders. A person&#x27;s dispositional tendency to trust others can be considered a personality trait and as such is one of the strongest predictors of subjective well-being. Trust increases subjective well-being because it enhances the quality of one&#x27;s interpersonal relationships; happy people are skilled at fostering good relationships.

Trust is integral to the idea of social influence: it is easier to influence or persuade someone who is trusting. The notion of trust is increasingly adopted to predict acceptance of behaviors by others, institutions (e.g. government agencies), and objects such as machines. Yet once again, perceptions of honesty, competence and value similarity (slightly similar to benevolence) are essential.

There are three forms of trust commonly studied in psychology:
* &quot;Trust&quot; is being vulnerable to someone even when they are trustworthy.
* &quot;Trustworthiness&quot; are the characteristics or behaviors of one person that inspire positive expectations in another person.
* &quot;Trust propensity&quot; is the tendency to make oneself vulnerable to others in general. Research suggests that this general tendency can change over time in response to key life events.
Once trust is lost by violation of one of these three determinants, it is very hard to regain. There is asymmetry in the building versus destruction of trust.

Research has been conducted into the social implications of trust, for instance:

* Barbara Misztal attempted to combine all notions of trust. She described three functions of trust: it makes social life predictable, it creates a sense of community, and it makes it easier for people to work together.
* In the context of sexual trust, Riki Robbins describes four stages. These consist of perfect trust, damaged trust, devastated trust, and restored trust.
* In the context of information theory, Ed Gerck social functions such as power, surveillance, and accountability.
* From a social identity perspective, the propensity to trust strangers (see in-group favoritism) arises from the mutual knowledge of a shared group membership, stereotypes, or the need to maintain the group&#x27;s positive distinctiveness.
Despite the centrality of trust to the positive functioning of people and relationships, very little is known about how and why trust evolves, is maintained, and is destroyed.

One factor that enhances trust among people is facial resemblance. Experimenters who digitally manipulated facial resemblance in a two-person sequential trust game found evidence that people have more trust in a partner who has similar facial features. Facial resemblance also decreased sexual desire for a partner. In a series of tests, digitally manipulated faces were presented to subjects who evaluated them for attractiveness within a long-term or short-term relationship. The results showed that within the context of a short-term relationship dependent on sexual desire, similar facial features caused a decrease in desire. Within the context of a long-term relationship, which is dependent on trust, similar facial features increased a person&#x27;s attractiveness. This suggests that facial resemblance and trust have great effects on relationships.

Interpersonal trust literature investigates &quot;trust-diagnostic situations&quot;: situations that test partners&#x27; abilities to act in the best interests of the other person or the relationship while rejecting a conflicting option which is merely in their self-interest. Trust-diagnostic situations occur throughout everyday life, though they can also be deliberately engineered by people who want to test the current level of trust in a relationship.

A low-trust relationship is one in which a person has little confidence their partner is truly concerned about them or the relationship. People in low trust relationships tend to make distress-maintaining attributions whereby they place their greatest focus on the consequences of their partner&#x27;s negative behavior, and any impacts of positive actions are minimized. This feeds into the overarching notion that the person&#x27;s partner is uninterested in the relationship, and any positive acts on their part are met with skepticism, leading to further negative outcomes.

Distrusting people may miss opportunities for trusting relationships. Someone subject to an abusive childhood may have been deprived of any evidence that trust is warranted in future relationships. An important key to treating sexual victimization of a child is the rebuilding of trust between parent and child. Failure by adults to validate that sexual abuse occurred contributes to the child&#x27;s difficulty in trusting self and others. A child&#x27;s trust can also be affected by the erosion of the marriage of their parents. Children of divorce do not exhibit less trust in mothers, partners, spouses, friends, and associates than their peers of intact families. The impact of parental divorce is limited to trust in the father.

People may trust non-human agents. For instance, people may trust animals, the scientific process, and . Trust helps create a social contract that allows humans and domestic animals to live together. Trust in the scientific process is associated with increased trust in innovations such as biotechnology. When it comes to trust in social machines, people are more willing to trust intelligent machines with humanoid morphologies and female cues, when they are focused on tasks (versus socialization), and when they behave morally well. More generally, they may be trusted as a function of the &quot;machine heuristic&quot;—a mental shortcut with which people assume that machines are less biased, more accurate, and more reliable than people—such that people may sometimes trust a robot more than a person.

People are disposed to trust and to judge the trustworthiness of other people or groups—for instance, in developing relationships with potential mentors. One example would be as part of interprofessional work in the referral pathway from an emergency department to a hospital ward. Another would be building knowledge on whether new practices, people, and things introduced into our lives are indeed accountable or worthy of investing confidence and trust in. This process is captured by the empirically grounded construct of &quot;Relational Integration&quot; within Normalization Process Theory. This can be traced in neuroscience terms to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain. Some studies indicate that trust can be altered by the application of oxytocin.

===Social identity approach===
The social identity approach explains a person&#x27;s trust in strangers as a function of their group-based stereotypes or in-group favoring behaviors which they base on salient group memberships. With regard to ingroup favoritism, people generally think well of strangers but expect better treatment from in-group members in comparison to out-group members. This greater expectation translates into a propensity to trust a member of the in-group more than a member of the out-group. It is only advantageous for one to form such expectations of an in-group stranger if the stranger also knows one&#x27;s own group membership.

The social identity approach has been empirically investigated. Researchers have employed allocator studies to understand group-based trust in strangers. They may be operationalized as unilateral or relationships of exchange. General social categories such as university affiliation, course majors, and even ad-hoc groups have been used to distinguish between in-group and out-group members. In unilateral studies of trust, the participant is asked to choose between envelopes containing money that an in-group or out-group member previously allocated. Participants have no prior or future opportunities for interaction, thereby testing Brewer&#x27;s notion that group membership is sufficient to bring about group-based trust and hence cooperation. Participants could expect an amount ranging from nothing to the maximum value an allocator could give out. Bilateral studies of trust have employed an investment game devised by Berg and colleagues in which people choose to give a portion or none of their money to another. Any amount given would be tripled and the receiver would then decide whether they would return the favor by giving money back to the sender. This was meant to test trusting behavior on the sender&#x27;s part and the receiver&#x27;s eventual trustworthiness.

Empirical research demonstrates that when group membership is salient to both parties, trust is granted more readily to in-group members than out-group members. This occurs even when the in-group&#x27;s stereotype was comparatively less positive than the out-group&#x27;s , , and when participants had the option of a sure sum of money (i.e. in essence opting out of the need to trust a stranger to gain some monetary reward). When only was made aware of group membership, trust becomes reliant upon group stereotypes. The group with the more positive stereotype was trusted (e.g. one&#x27;s university affiliation over another&#x27;s) even over that of the in-group (e.g. nursing over psychology majors).

Another explanation for in-group-favoring behaviors could be the need to maintain in-group positive distinctiveness, particularly in the presence of social identity threat. Trust in out-group strangers increased when personal cues to identity were revealed.

==Philosophy==
Many philosophers have written about different forms of trust. Most agree that interpersonal trust is the foundation on which these forms can be modeled. For an act to be an expression of trust, it must not betray the expectations of the trustee. Some philosophers, such as Lagerspetz, argue that trust is a kind of reliance, though not merely reliance. Gambetta argued that trust is the inherent belief that others generally have good intentions, which is the foundation for our reliance on them. Philosophers such as Annette Baier challenged this view, asserting a difference between trust and reliance by saying that trust can be betrayed, whereas reliance can only be disappointed. Carolyn McLeod explains Baier&#x27;s argument with the following examples: we can rely on our clock to give the time, but we do not feel betrayed when it breaks, thus, we cannot say that we trusted it; we are not trusting when we are suspicious of another person, because this is in fact an expression of distrust. The violation of trust warrants this sense of betrayal. Thus, trust is different from reliance in the sense that a trustor accepts the risk of being betrayed.

Karen Jones proposed an emotional aspect to trust—optimism that the trustee will do the right thing by the trustor, which is also described as &quot;affective trust&quot;. People sometimes trust others even without this optimistic expectation, instead hoping that by extending trust this will prompt trustworthy behavior in the trustee. This is known as &quot;therapeutic trust&quot; and gives both the trustee a reason to be trustworthy, and the trustor a reason to believe they are trustworthy.

The definition of trust as a belief in something or a confident expectation about something eliminates the notion of risk because it does not include whether the expectation or belief is favorable or unfavorable. For example, to expect a friend to arrive to dinner late because she has habitually arrived late for the last fifteen years is a confident expectation (whether or not we find her late arrivals to be annoying). The trust is not about what we wish for, but rather it is in the consistency of the data. As a result, there is no risk or sense of betrayal because the data exists as collective knowledge. Faulkner contrasts such &quot;predictive trust&quot; with the aforementioned affective trust, proposing that predictive trust may only warrant disappointment as a consequence of an inaccurate prediction, not a sense of betrayal.

==Economics==

Trust in economics explains the difference between actual human behavior and behavior that could be explained by people&#x27;s desire to maximize utility. In economic terms, trust can explain a difference between Nash equilibrium and the observed equilibrium. Such an approach can be applied to individual people as well as to societies.

Trust is important to economists for many reasons. Taking the &quot;Market for Lemons&quot; transaction popularized by George Akerlof as an example, if a potential buyer of a car does not trust the seller not to sell a lemon, the transaction will not take place. The buyer will not buy without trust, even if the product would be of great value to the buyer. Trust can act as an economic lubricant, reducing the cost of transactions between parties, enabling new forms of cooperation, and generally furthering business activities, employment, and prosperity. This observation prompted interest in trust as a form of social capital and research into the process of creation and distribution of such capital. A higher level of social trust may be positively correlated with economic development: Even though the original concept of &quot;high trust&quot; and &quot;low trust&quot; societies may not necessarily hold, social trust benefits the economy and a low level of trust inhibits economic growth. The absence of trust restricts growth in employment, wages, and profits, thus reducing the overall welfare of society. The World Economic Forums of 2022 and 2024 both adopted the rebuilding of trust as their themes.

Theoretical economical modelling demonstrates that the optimum level of trust that a rational economic agent should exhibit in transactions is equal to the trustworthiness of the other party. Such a level of trust leads to an efficient market. Trusting less leads to losing economic opportunities, while trusting more leads to unnecessary vulnerabilities and potential exploitation. Economics is also interested in quantifying trust, usually in monetary terms. The level of correlation between an increase in profit margin and a decrease in transactional costs can be used as an indicator of the economic value of trust.

Economic &quot;trust games&quot; empirically quantify trust in relationships under laboratory conditions. Several games and game-like scenarios related to trust have been tried, those that allow the estimation of confidence in monetary terms. In games of trust the Nash equilibrium differs from Pareto optimum so that no player alone can maximize their own utility by altering their selfish strategy without cooperation. Cooperating partners can also benefit. The classical version of the game of trust has been described as an abstract investment game, using the scenario of an investor and a broker. The investor can invest some fraction of his money, and the broker can return to the investor some fraction of the investor&#x27;s gains. If both players follow their naive economic best interest, the investor should never invest, and the broker will never be able to repay anything. Thus the flow of money, its volume, is attributable entirely to the existence of trust. Such a game can be played as a once-off, or repeatedly with the same or different sets of players to distinguish between a general propensity to trust and trust within particular relationships. Several variants of this game exist. Reversing rules leads to the game of distrust, pre-declarations can be used to establish intentions of players, while alterations to the distribution of gains can be used to manipulate the perceptions of both players. The game can be played by several players on the closed market, with or without information about reputation.

Other interesting games include binary-choice trust games and the gift-exchange game. Games based on the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma link trust with economic utility and demonstrate the rationality behind reciprocity.

The popularization of e-commerce led to new challenges related to trust within the digital economy and the desire to understand buyers&#x27; and sellers&#x27; decisions to trust one another. For example, interpersonal relationships between buyers and sellers have been disintermediated by the technology, and consequentially they required improvement. Websites can influence the buyer to trust the seller, regardless of the seller&#x27;s actual trustworthiness. Reputation-based systems can improve trust assessment by capturing a collective perception of trustworthiness; this has generated interest in various models of reputation.

== Management and organization science ==
In management and organization science, trust is studied as a factor which organizational actors can manage and influence. Scholars have researched how trust develops across individual and organizational levels of analysis. They suggest a reciprocal process in which organizational structures influence people&#x27;s trust and, at the same time, people&#x27;s trust manifests in organizational structures. Trust is also one of the conditions of an organizational culture that supports knowledge sharing. An organizational culture that supports knowledge sharing allows employees to feel secure and comfortable to share their knowledge, their work, and their expertise. Structure often creates trust in a person, and this encourages them to feel comfortable and excel in the workplace; it makes an otherwise stressful environment manageable.

Management and organization science scholars have also studied how trust is influenced by contracts and how trust interacts with formal mechanisms. Scholars in management and related disciplines have also made a case for the importance of &quot;distrust&quot; as a related but distinct construct. Similarly scholars have assessed the relationship between monitoring and trust, for example in a trust game context, and in shareholder-management relations.

Since the mid-1990s, organizational research has followed two distinct but nonexclusive paradigms of trust research:
# The first distinguishes between two major dimensions of trust: Trust in another can be characterized as cognition-based trust (based on rational calculation) and affect-based trust (based on emotional attachment). For example, trust in an auto repair shop could come in the form of an assessment of the capabilities of the shop to do a good job repairing one&#x27;s car (cognition-based trust) or of having a longstanding relationship with the shop&#x27;s owner (affect-based trust).
# The second distinguishes between the trustworthiness factors that give rise to trust (i.e., one&#x27;s perceived ability, benevolence, and integrity) and trust itself.
Together, these paradigms predict how different dimensions of trust form in organizations by demonstrating various trustworthiness attributes.

==Systems==
In systems, a trusted component has a set of properties that another component can rely on. If A trusts B, a violation in B&#x27;s properties might compromise A&#x27;s correct operation. Observe that those properties of B trusted by A might not correspond quantitatively or qualitatively to B&#x27;s actual properties. This occurs when the designer of the overall system does not consider the relation. Consequently, trust should be placed to the extent of the component&#x27;s trustworthiness. The trustworthiness of a component is thus, not surprisingly, defined by how well it secures a set of functional and non-functional properties, deriving from its architecture, construction, and environment, and evaluated as appropriate.

<doc id="850669" wikidata="Q261401" url="?curid=850669" title="Soyuz TM-5">
<text>Soyuz TM-5 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to Mir. It was launched on June 7, 1988, carrying the Mir EP-2 mission&#x27;s three-person crew. This week-long stay on Mir occurred during the third long-duration Mir expedition, Mir EO-3. The crew of EP-2 returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-4, while the TM-5 spacecraft remained docked to Mir, acting as the lifeboat for the long-duration crew. On September 7, 1988, the TM-5 spacecraft undocked from Mir, and landed Mir EP-3 mission&#x27;s two-person visiting crew. The de-orbit procedures for Soyuz were revised after this flight, as multiple issues almost prevented the descent module&#x27;s safe de-orbit and landing.

==Crew==
==Launch==

Soyuz TM-5 launched on 1988 June 7 and arrived at Mir on June 9 carrying the second Bulgarian in space, Alexandrov (not to be confused with the Soviet cosmonaut of the same name). He became the first Bulgarian to reach a Soviet space station (Georgi Ivanov failed to reach Salyut 6 on Soyuz 33 in 1979—Alexandrov was his backup). Their launch had been advanced by 2 weeks late in the planning stages to improve lighting conditions for the Rozhen astronomical experiment.

==Landing==

On September 5 cosmonauts Lyakhov and Mohmand undocked from Mir. They jettisoned the orbital module and made ready for deorbit burn to return to Earth. During descent, the spacecraft experienced a computer software problem combined with a sensor problem. This caused their landing to be delayed by a full day. The Descent Module, where they spent this 24-hour period, had no sanitary facilities. Consequently, they soiled themselves. They would not have been able to redock with Mir because they had discarded the docking system along with the orbital module. Reentry occurred as normal on September 7. Following this incident, the Soviets decided that on future missions, they would retain the orbital module until after deorbit burn, as they had done on the Soyuz Ferry flights.

<doc id="850670" wikidata="Q7363324" url="?curid=850670" title="2000 Romsey by-election">
<text>Conservative Member of Parliament Michael Colvin and his wife died in a fire at their home on 24 February 2000. This created a [[by-election]] in his constituency of [[Romsey (constituency)|Romsey]] in Hampshire, England.

The Conservative Party decided to delay the polling day until 4 May, so that it would come simultaneously with local elections. They selected Tim Palmer, a farmer and Dorset County Councillor, to defend the seat. The Liberal Democrats considered this byelection their best chance of gaining a seat since 1997 and selected a local pharmacist Sandra Gidley (who had been Mayor of Romsey) as their candidate.

Labour carried out minimal campaigning in a constituency in which they had come third for years. This led many observers to assume that the party was expecting, or hoping, that its vote would largely go to the Liberal Democrats in order to help defeat the Conservatives. In the event, the Labour vote collapsed while the Liberal Democrats surged, and they made this the only mainland by-election to result in a change of party control in the entire Parliament. This was the first time the Conservatives had lost a seat in a by-election while in Opposition since the 1965 Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election, and would be the last time the Liberal Democrats gained a constituency from the Conservatives at a by-election until the 2016 Richmond Park by-election.

<doc id="850675" wikidata="Q954934" url="?curid=850675" title="Don't Cry for Me Argentina">
<text>&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; is a song recorded by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album &quot;Evita&quot;, later included in the 1978 musical of the same name. The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentine leader Eva Perón. It appears at the opening of the first and second acts, as well as near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, during Eva&#x27;s speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada, and during her final broadcast.

The &quot;Evita&quot; album had taken 3–4 months to record, since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings. The song had a number of different titles before &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was chosen as the final one. The song shares its melody with &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot; from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews.

The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with over a million copies sold. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands. &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was critically appreciated, with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. When &quot;Evita&quot; moved to a London theatre, Covington—who had become disenchanted with the whole project—refused to reprise the part of Eva, and the role went to Elaine Paige. &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; has been covered by multiple artists, including David Essex, The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor as well as actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer from the TV series &quot;Glee‍&quot;.

In 1996, American singer Madonna played the title role in the film adaptation of the musical and recorded her rendition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;. Released as the second single from the film soundtrack on 16 December 1996, her version received positive reviews from music critics who praised her vocal performance. A separate version called the &quot;Miami Mix&quot;, which included re-recorded vocals in English and Spanish and an Argentinian bandoneon, was promoted to radio. Madonna&#x27;s version reached number one on the European Hot 100 Singles chart and the national charts of the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, and Spain. It also became a top-ten hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and many other charts worldwide, while attaining gold or platinum in six countries.

== Background and development ==

&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were developing &quot;Evita&quot; in 1976. Both were extremely intrigued by the stories surrounding the life of Eva Perón while researching her during the mid-1970s. &quot;Evita&quot; was initially produced as an album, before being adapted for the stage, following a formula that Lloyd Webber and Rice had employed during the production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, their previous musical. The duo had written the songs for a female singer with good vocals.

Rice and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s research showed that Eva had not in reality delivered any major oration on the day of her husband Juan Perón&#x27;s inauguration ceremony, but not long after becoming Argentina&#x27;s new First Lady, she started making highly emotional speeches, the intensity of which they wanted to capture with &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;. The song was composed to appear at the opening and near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, and finally during Eva&#x27;s speech from the balcony of Casa Rosada. Its melody is similar to the opening song of the musical, &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot;, which puts emphasis on Eva&#x27;s funeral. As &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot; ended with the character Che&#x27;s sarcastic questioning of the mourning behind Eva&#x27;s death, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; started with only few lines being sung, while the rest of the song was reserved for the finale.

After the song was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice were struggling to find a suitable musical actress for the songs and the title role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, had moved to the United States. One day they were watching the British musical television show &quot;Rock Follies&quot;, where they noticed actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like &quot;Godspell&quot;, and her acting abilities in &quot;Rock Follies&quot; convinced Rice and Lloyd Webber to sign her for &quot;Evita&quot;.

Covington was extremely intrigued by their proposal, considering Eva Perón to be a non-commercial idea for a musical. Nevertheless, she thought that the songs were great compositions and signed on for recording them. Lloyd Webber and Rice immediately started recording, and the first demos were those of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Be Surprisingly Good for You&quot; and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, with just piano as an accompaniment. They moved on to sign a deal with MCA Records, to release an album based on the songs, however with extremely poor royalty rates since the record company executives did not expect the album to be a success. In the meantime, singers for all the other roles of the musical were also signed, and the cast moved to Olympic Studios in 1975 to start recording.

== Recording and composition ==
Personnel working on the &quot;Evita&quot; album included recording engineer David Hamilton-Smith, Simon Philips on drums, Mo Foster on bass, Joe Moretti and Ray Russell on guitars and Anne Odell on keyboards. David Snell played the harp while Anthony Bowles conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, while another choir called the London Boy Singles was directed by Alan Doggett. Members of The Grease Band, including bassist Alan Spenner and rhythm guitarist Neil Hubbard, also played on the album. It took a total of 3–4 months to finish the recording.
The intensity which Rice looked for in the track was not immediately achieved during recording, because it is a sentimental ballad and because of its lyrics. As the delivery date of the recording approached, they got more tense since most of the album was put together. Only this song was left as they could not decide on the final title, and Rice tried out names which did not make sense within the political and dramatic atmosphere of the story. They had initially tried out various lyrics as the main hook and title of the song including &quot;It&#x27;s Only Your Lover Returning&quot; and &quot;All Through My Crazy and Wild Days&quot; amid fears that mentioning Argentina would reduce the commercial appeal. Rice recalled, &quot;What a crass decision! It was probably the only time (honest) that I had made the mistake of caring more about a lyric&#x27;s potential outside the show than its importance within it, and as a result both song and show suffered.&quot; Covington had already recorded the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; for using it in the beginning of the show. Shortly before the album was finally mixed, Lloyd Webber suggested to Rice that the line also worked as the title of Eva&#x27;s speech. As soon as Covington recorded with the new name, the song fit &quot;perfectly&quot; in the mood of the sequence and was included in the album.

The title of the song comes from an epitaph on a plaque at Eva Perón&#x27;s grave in the La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. The plaque was presented by the city&#x27;s taxi drivers&#x27; union and roughly translates as: &quot;Don&#x27;t cry for me Argentina, I remain quite near to you.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote &quot;For years I have wondered, during &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me, Argentina,&#x27; why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything out of life she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to the status of a &#x27;walker,&#x27; a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory.&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics are a &quot;string of meaningless platitudes&quot; according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a &quot;megalomaniac woman&quot; trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics &quot;And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions&quot;.

Lloyd Webber&#x27;s orchestral accompaniment added a different level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington&#x27;s opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, &quot;But all you have to do is look at me to know / That every word is true&quot; is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of D♭ major with Covington&#x27;s vocals spanning from the nodes of G3 to C5. According to Snelson the song is not only based on J.S.Bach&#x27;s Prelude in C Major but also on Gounod&#x27;s Ave Maria adaptation.

== Release and reception ==

Following the completion of the recording of the album, the &quot;Evita&quot; team switched on to full promotion of the release, with photographer Tony Snowdon shooting the promotional pictures. The single version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews. Another song from the musical, &quot;Rainbow High&quot;, was listed as its B-side. MCA marketing manager Stuart Watson explained to &quot;Billboard&quot; that their chief goal was to &quot;get an explanation of the story of Eva Perón over to the public&quot;. 

The song received critical appreciation, with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; calling it a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. However, Rice and Lloyd Webber felt that they needed more promotion to reach the general audience who would buy the record. They had initially decided for a number of television show appearances and performances, but Covington was uninterested in the project altogether and refused to promote it further. Her reasons included wanting to perform the song with the same studio orchestra and accompaniments, and she was also against a single release from the album.

The song was never performed live on the British music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, since Covington refused and whenever it was featured on the show, a montage of images of the real Eva was shown in the backdrops. However, during the week it was number one, she appeared in the audience. Rice and Lloyd Webber then targeted BBC Radio 1, which was in its infancy, but still popular among the general crowd. They had a fairly tight selection of songs they aired on their channels, and Radio 1 refused to add &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; in their playlists. Rice and Lloyd Webber panicked and were almost on the verge of releasing another track from &quot;Evita&quot; called &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot;, recorded by Barbara Dickson, as the second single. But Radio 1 finally relented and started playing the song due to positive response from audiences.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; debuted at number 37 on the UK Singles Chart on the week ending 25 December 1976. It started climbing up the chart but for 3 weeks it was kept from reaching the top spot by David Soul&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Us&quot;. On the week ending 12 February 1977, the song reached the top of the charts. It was first certified silver in January 1977, and then certified gold a month later by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), selling almost one million physical copies in the United Kingdom. Together with digital sales since it has sold about 1.01 million copies according to the Official Charts Company. 

The single also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and Netherlands; in the latter country it sold around 100,000 copies. Seeing the success of the single, Rice and Lloyd Webber proceeded with promoting the song in the United States. However, the personnel at MCA Records&#x27; US office were not able to come to terms regarding how to promote the adult contemporary oriented track; it was ultimately never sent to Top 40/CHR radio, and did not appear on any US charts.

== Aftermath and impact ==
When the cast of the London musical version of &quot;Evita&quot; was being decided, Rice and Lloyd Webber naturally approached Covington to play the title role. However, she chose not to reprise the role. Producer Hal Prince wanted to cast a relatively unknown actress to play Eva, and thus Elaine Paige was signed for the part. In 1977, Rice and Lloyd Webber received the Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. 

During the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina, the song was sometimes played sarcastically by British regimental bands as they deployed to the Falklands. They changed the lyrics, singing it as &quot;You don&#x27;t frighten me Argentina / The truth is we will defeat you / We&#x27;ll sink your carrier, with our Sea Harrier / And with our Sea Kings subs&#x27;ll be sinking&quot;. At the same time the Covington recording was banned from play on the BBC. In the Philippines, the presentation of the musical was repressed during the dictatorship (1972–86) of President Ferdinand Marcos, due to the perceived similarities between the First Lady Imelda Marcos and Eva Perón. In the United States, the song is also closely linked with Patti LuPone, who performed the role of Eva in the original Broadway production of the show.

== Madonna version ==
=== Background ===
In 1996, Madonna starred in the film &quot;Evita&quot;, playing the title role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even wrote a letter to director Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since &quot;Evita&quot; required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer &quot;had to use her voice in a way she&#x27;s never used it before. &quot;Evita&quot; is real musical theater — it&#x27;s operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn&#x27;t know she had.&quot; From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;. According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, &quot;since [Madonna] didn&#x27;t write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, the best way to do it was go in the studio and work up a remix&quot;.

For this, in August 1996, while still mixing the film&#x27;s soundtrack, Madonna hired remixers Pablo Flores and Javier Garza. According to Flores, the singer wanted something that &quot;would be dance but faithful to the movie and to Argentina with a latin feel&quot;. Madonna herself said she wanted the remix to have a &quot;Latin flavor and elements of Tango music&quot;. The mix was completed in two weeks at Miami and Los Angeles. Madonna had to re-record the vocals of the track in English and Spanish, while an Argentinian bandoneon was added to the song&#x27;s intro. Named the &quot;Miami Mix&quot;, it was sent to radio stations and DJs on late December 1996. The song was officially released as the soundtrack&#x27;s second single on 16 December 1996 in the United Kingdom, while in the United States, the track was released on 11 February 1997. Barney Kilpatrick, VP of promotion for Warner Bros. Records, said that &quot;the only reason this mix is being done was to accommodate Top 40 radio [...] since we have a two-disc soundtrack, we&#x27;re interested in selling albums, not singles&quot;. Warner Bros wanted to create buzz for the film with the song, not the single remix. There were also talks of releasing an &quot;Evita&quot; EP, containing remixes of &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; and &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot;, but it never materialized.

=== Recording and composition ===

Recording sessions for the film&#x27;s songs and soundtrack began in September 1995, and took place at the CTS Studios in London with Madonna accompanied by co-actors Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. However, trouble arose as Madonna was not completely comfortable with laying down a &quot;guide vocal&quot; simultaneously with an 84 piece orchestra inside the studio. She was used to singing over a pre-recorded track and not have musicians listen to her. Also, unlike her previous soundtrack releases, she had little to no control over the project; &quot;I&#x27;m used to writing my own songs and I go into a studio, choose the musicians and say what sounds good or doesn&#x27;t [...] To work on 46 songs with everyone involved and not have a big say was a big adjustment&quot;, she recalled. An emergency meeting was held between Parker, Lloyd Webber and Madonna where it was decided that the singer would record her part in a more contemporary studio while the orchestration would take place somewhere else. She also had alternate days off from the recording.

According to the singer, she was very nervous during the first day of recording. She allegedly found herself &quot;petrified&quot; when it came to doing the song; &quot;I had to sing &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&#x27; in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber [...] I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought I had done a terrible job&quot;, she recalled. The final version recorded had many similarities to the original version by Covington, although it had a much faster pace and was created as an orchestral pop to cater to the contemporary music scene. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, Madonna&#x27;s version of the song is set in common time, with a slow groove tempo of 90 beats per minute. Madonna&#x27;s vocals on the song span from G3 to C5.

=== Critical reception ===
==== Original version ====
Upon release, the song generally received positive feedback. J. D. Considine, from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, said it was one of the &quot;big songs&quot; from the soundtrack. Peter Keough, from the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, praised Madonna&#x27;s &quot;stunning delivery&quot; of the track. He wrote: &quot;[Madonna] sings a softly lush soprano that captures Evita&#x27;s quiet vulnerability. Her full-lipped, precise notes stride across the song&#x27;s grandiose orchestrations. Webber&#x27;s songs allow her all the room she needs to be many things; she succeeds at them all&quot;. Greg Kot from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, opined that &quot;her interpretation of the show-stopper &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27; doesn&#x27;t try to outreach the many previous versions, but instead brings it back to earth with a low-key dignity&quot;. Robert Christgau called it a &quot;dismal track&quot; and criticized its mixing. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chuck Arnold opined that &quot;while credible, [Madonna&#x27;s rendition] was not going to make anybody forget Patti Lupone&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Jude Rogers wrote: &quot;Sorry Andrew Lloyd Webber, but it&#x27;s no &#x27;Live to Tell&#x27;&quot;; nonetheless, she praised the singer&#x27;s vocal capacities. A very positive review came from the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;″s Greg Morago, who called the song &quot;a calculated, theatrical triumph of shameless pandering and steely determination that parallels the pop diva&#x27;s own rise to the top. Madonna makes this song her own; she was born to play the chignon-coiffed, diamond-studded Santa Evita&quot;. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;″s Matthew Jacobs considered it as one of Madonna&#x27;s most important songs, a &quot;stand-in for the transition from Sexy Madonna to Adult Madonna&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, David Gritten opined that &quot;show-stoppers like &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27;, which need to be belted out, sound comfortable for her&quot;.

A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; rated it five out of five, calling it &quot;a strong and fairly faithful rendition&quot;. In her review of &quot;Evita&quot;, Janet Maslin from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the track was &quot;tinglingly sung&quot;. A negative review came from &quot;NME&quot;″s Alex Needham, who wrote; &quot;by 1996 Madonna was fast turning into the pop equivalent of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;″s Norma Desmond, croaking, &#x27;I&#x27;m still big! It&#x27;s just the Top 40 that got small!&quot;, and that &quot;″Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&#x27; stank then, stinks now&quot;. Author Lucy O&#x27;Brien wrote in the book, &quot;&quot;, that although Madonna&#x27;s vocals lacked emotional complexity in the tune, she nevertheless created a &quot;compelling&quot; version, &quot;right up to its grand orchestral finale&quot;. George Hatza from &quot;The Reading Eagle&quot;, said that &quot;[Madonna] sings &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&#x27; in a beautiful, soaring, goosebump-inducing contralto&quot;. Peter Travers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote: &quot;Madonna, to her credit, puts on quite a show. She sings. She tangos [...] She even belts out &#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&#x27; to prove she&#x27;s just folks&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commented: &quot;Easily one of Madonna&#x27;s greatest vocal performances to date, the singer&#x27;s dramatic interpretation of Evita&#x27;s unofficial theme song was both loyal and bizarrely autobiographical&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Annie Zaleski wrote that the &quot;nuanced but proud&quot; rendition of the song &quot;marked the start of Madonna&#x27;s Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettishness with a more mature, introspective outlook&quot;. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of &quot;&quot;, wrote that &quot;As Evita Perón [...] she is supple and strong, and doesn&#x27;t sound at all out of place&quot;. The song was nominated for an inclusion in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs.

==== Remix version ====
AllMusic&#x27;s Jose F. Promis praised the &quot;Miami Mix&quot; version of the song; &quot;[&#x27;Don&#x27;t Cry For Me Argentina&#x27;] was transformed into a passionate, flowing dance number&quot;, highlighting Madonna&#x27;s &quot;truly impassioned performance which infuriated musical purists but delighted her fans and public alike&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the &quot;Miami Mix&quot; as the 95th greatest pop song of 1997; Andrew Unterberger wrote that the remix &quot;is just as responsible for the song&#x27;s chart success as Madonna&#x27;s Celine Dion vocal ambitions, taking the song from the balcony to the dance floor and giving it back to the people&quot;. In 2018, the same magazine called the remix &quot;a weirdly enjoyable menage à trois between Broadway, Latin and club music, with a pounding beat and lively tango that flourishes with Madonna&#x27;s earnest delivery&quot;. 

=== Chart performance ===
In the United States, the popularity of the &quot;Miami Mix&quot; version of the song enabled it to become the song with the most radio adds, and jumped to number 18 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. Demand for the song continued to increase forcing Warner Bros. to release the CD single, and the song becoming eligible to chart. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 17 the week of 22 February 1997, selling 46,000 units in its first-week. The single ultimately peaked at number 8 the week of 1 March 1997, becoming the first top 10 to originate in a stage musical since 1985 and Webber&#x27;s first top 10 single in the US. The track also ranked within the top 20 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary and Adult Top 40 charts while the &quot;Miami Mix&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart. It ranked at number 87 on the year end chart for 1997. 

In Canada, the song debuted on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart at number 34, the week of 10 March 1997. It ultimately reached a peak of number 11, the week of 7 April 1997. &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; reached number 1 on the European Hot 100 Singles, the week of 8 February 1997. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number 3 on the week of 28 December 1996, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 13 weeks. The song was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 19 November 2021 for sales and streams exceeding 400,000. In Italy, it reached the second position on the &quot;Musica e dischi&quot; chart. In Australia, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; peaked at number 9 on the ARIA Singles Chart, staying on this position for one week and a total of 13 weeks on the chart. On the year-end ARIA charts, the song ranked at number 56. In France, it topped the SNEP Singles Chart for one month. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 8, the week of 19 December 1996. The single also proved to be a commercial success in other countries such as Belgium, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, where it managed to have top 5 placement.

=== Promotion and live performances ===

No official video was shot for the song. Instead, the scene from the movie, where Eva performs the song at the balcony of the Casa Rosada, was used. In 1993, two years before being cast in &quot;Evita&quot;, Madonna performed an impromptu version of the song during her first visit to Argentina with the Girlie Show. Eight years later, on 2001&#x27;s Drowned World Tour, an instrumental version of the song was used as an interlude, featuring several dancers doing a Tango number. The performance on 26 August 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, outside of Madonna&#x27;s hometown of Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, &quot;Drowned World Tour 2001&quot;. On the Buenos Aires stop of her Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour in December 2008, after performing &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, Madonna also performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; as scenes from &quot;Evita&quot; played on the backdrop screens. The performances of both songs in the city were recorded in the live DVD titled, &quot;Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour&quot; (2010). 

The singer once again performed the song in Argentina during the MDNA Tour in December 2012. For the performance, she had the word &quot;Eva&quot; painted across her back. Madonna also did a &quot;passionate rendition&quot; of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; during the Miami stop of her Rebel Heart Tour on 23 January 2016, accompanied by acoustic guitar. On 6 December, Madonna performed &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; during the Carpool Karaoke segment of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;. Seven years later, on the Celebration Tour, the song was mashed-up with &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; (1987). The number ended with Madonna ―who donned a cowboy hat, leather jacket, and pride flag as cape― chanting the phrase &quot;no fear!&quot;, while a picture of Irish singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor was shown on the backdrop screens. From the &quot;Palm Springs Tribune&quot;, Marc Bearden felt the rendition was &quot;beautifully done&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; has been recorded by a number of actors portraying Eva Peron in subsequent productions of &quot;Evita&quot; including Elaine Paige (1978 Original London Cast Recording), Patti LuPone (1979 Original Broadway Cast Recording) and Elena Roger (2006 London Cast and 2014 Broadway Cast Recordings). Marti Webb, who succeeded Elaine Paige in the original London production of &quot;Evita&quot;, covered the song on her album &quot;Won&#x27;t Change Places&quot;, produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1981, and also included it in 1995 on the album, &quot;Music and Songs from Evita&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Joe Francis complimented the recording.
The Carpenters recorded the song for their 1977 album, &quot;Passage&quot;, coupled with &quot;On the Balcony of the Casa Rosada&quot; which precedes it in the musical&#x27;s score. The same year, Olivia Newton-John released the song as a single from her tenth studio album, &quot;Making a Good Thing Better&quot;. In 1978, the Shadows recorded an instrumental version that reached number five on the UK Singles Chart. Also in 1978 Shirley Bassey recorded the song for her album, &quot;The Magic Is You&quot;. Simon Gage from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; praised the rendition, saying that Bassey &quot;more than covers the ground&quot; with it. She recorded it again in 1993 for her album &quot;Sings the Songs of Andrew Lloyd Webber&quot;. Singer Tom Jones&#x27; interpretation of the song on his 1979 album, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, received negative reviews, with biographer Lucy Ellis describing it as &quot;the most ludicrous massacre on the LP&quot;. American disco group Festival (produced by Boris Midney) released a version in 1979, the single from an entire LP of disco covers of songs from &quot;Evita&quot;; it reached 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Paloma San Basilio performed the song when she played the title role on the Spanish adaptation of the musical in 1980. Nacha Guevara, who also starred in the musical in 1986, has performed the song live several times.

Singer Sinéad O&#x27;Connor recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; on her album &quot;Am I Not Your Girl?&quot; (1992). Her version received mixed response, with Joy Press from &quot;Spin&quot; who described the rendition as &quot;a melodramatic, sweeping &#x27;Je ne regrette rien&#x27;—style apologia. O&#x27;Connor had a calling. Obsessed with purity and truth, she pitched herself somewhere between Christ and the Virgin Mary, as an asexual visionary whose suffering was Inextricably Intertwined with the pain of Ireland and of the world.&quot; Released as a CD maxi single, the song reached number 31 in Belgium Flanders and number 44 in Netherlands. An easy listening cover version of the song by The Mike Flowers Pops reached number 30 in the UK singles charts in 1996. A punk rock version was recorded by alternative band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in 1999 for their second studio album, &quot;Are a Drag&quot;. Angus Cargill, author of &quot;Hang the DJ: An alternative book of music lists&quot; was shocked by the complete revamp of the song as punk rock, saying that &quot;there&#x27;s a dark appeal in here, like the thought of taking a cattle prod to your grandma&#x27;s&quot;. An unidentified piano rendition was also used as an ident for V19, a French numbers station based in Spain; an audio recording from the station, titled &quot;Whiskey Tango Viente Y Uno&quot; after its callsign, is included on &quot;The Conet Project&quot;.

It is covered by Lloyd Webber&#x27;s younger brother and cellist Julian on the 2001 album, &quot;Lloyd Webber Plays Lloyd Webber&quot;. Another version was recorded in 2010 by TV series &quot;Glee&quot;″s actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer, as the characters Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel respectively. It was sung as a duet with each singer taking a different stanza and performing before a different audience in a split-scene. Their solo versions were also in &quot;Glee: The Music, The Complete Season Two&quot; and reached number 67 in the United Kingdom and number 97 in US. Multinational quartet Il Divo recorded it on their 2011 album, &quot;Wicked Game&quot;, and performed it live on tours. The group&#x27;s voice was considered suitable for musical numbers like &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot;, by Ben Walsh from &quot;The Independent&quot;. Nicole Scherzinger performed the song live at the &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber: 40 Musical Years&quot; tribute show. Louis Virtel from The Backlot complimented her vocals, saying that the performance &quot;has to be seen to be believed, as Scherzinger&#x27;s crystal-clear vocal soars like a glittery javelin&quot;.

<text>Soyuz TM-6 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to &quot;Mir&quot;. It was launched on 29 August 1988, at 04:23:11 UTC, for the station&#x27;s third long-duration expedition, Mir EO-3. The three-person crew that was launched consisted of Research Doctor Valeri Polyakov, who became part of the EO-3 crew, as well as the two crew members of the week-long mission Mir EP-3, which included the first ever Afghan cosmonaut, Abdul Ahad Mohmand.

On September 8, Soyuz TM-6 was undocked from &quot;Mir&quot;&#x27;s Kvant port and redocked onto the &quot;Mir&quot; Base Block&#x27;s port. It remained there until December, when it brought Titov and Manarov of the EO-3 crew back to Earth. It also landed French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien, ending his 25-day-long spaceflight which started with Soyuz TM-7. 

==Crew==
Valeri Polyakov remained behind on &quot;Mir&quot; with cosmonauts Musa Manarov and Vladimir Titov when Mohmand and Lyakhov returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-5.

The crew of Soyuz TM-6 had a unique makeup, with a commander (Vladimir Lyakhov) who had been trained to fly a Soyuz-TM solo in the event a rescue ship needed to be sent to recover two cosmonauts from &quot;Mir&quot;, no flight engineer, and two inexperienced cosmonaut-researchers. One was Valeri Polyakov, who would remain aboard &quot;Mir&quot; with Titov and Manarov to monitor their health during the final months of their planned year-long stay. The other was Intercosmos cosmonaut Abdul Ahad Mohmand, from Afghanistan.

<doc id="850689" wikidata="Q949869" url="?curid=850689" title="Rod Brind'Amour">
<text>Roderic Jean Brind&#x27;Amour (; born August 9, 1970) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who is the head coach for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL).

He was selected in the first round, ninth overall, by the St. Louis Blues in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Brind&#x27;Amour has also played for the Philadelphia Flyers and Carolina Hurricanes, the latter with whom he captained to the Stanley Cup in 2006, marking the first championship in franchise history.

==Playing career==
===Early years===
Born in Ottawa but raised in Prince Rupert and Campbell River, British Columbia, Brind&#x27;Amour was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the first round, ninth overall, of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. He played the next season at Michigan State University.

He became known for working out constantly, earning the nickname &quot;Rod the Bod&quot;. During his time at Michigan State, Brind&#x27;Amour would go from a game directly into the weight room, where he would undertake a strenuous workout. Spartans head coach Ron Mason said Brind&#x27;Amour&#x27;s workouts became so intense they would turn the lights out on him, and when that failed to work, they would padlock the room to bar his entry.

===St. Louis Blues (1988-91)===

At the conclusion of the 1988–89 Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) season with the Spartans, Brind&#x27;Amour joined the Blues during the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs. He made his debut in Game 5 of the Blues&#x27; division semifinals against the Minnesota North Stars, and scored a goal on his first shot. In his first full NHL season, 1989–90, Brind&#x27;Amour scored 27 points in the Blues&#x27; first 24 games and finished third on the Blues with 26 goals. For his efforts, Brind&#x27;Amour was selected to the 1989–90 All-Rookie Team.

When the Blues lost team captain and top defenceman Scott Stevens as compensation for the free agent signing of Brendan Shanahan, they suddenly had a big hole on their defense. General Manager Ron Caron targeted Philadelphia Flyers blue liner Murray Baron as his solution.

===Philadelphia Flyers (1991-2000)===
Brind&#x27;Amour was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers (along with Dan Quinn) in exchange for Murray Baron and Ron Sutter just before the start of the 1991–92 season. He spent his years in Philadelphia as an alternate to captain Kevin Dineen and then Eric Lindros, filling in as captain and wearing the &quot;C&quot; when the latter was out of the lineup. It was there he started his reputation of being one of the best shutdown centres of the NHL.

When the Flyers faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the 1997 playoffs, Brind&#x27;Amour scored two short-handed goals during a single power play. The Flyers made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Detroit Red Wings.

During his stint with Philadelphia, Brind&#x27;Amour was considered one of the NHL&#x27;s &quot;ironmen&quot; with a consecutive games streak of 484 played, a Flyers franchise record. He culminated his career as a Flyer after 633 games with franchise records as the seventh all-time in assists with 366, tenth all time in goals with 235 and ninth overall in points with 601. He was inducted into the Flyers Hall of Fame on November 23, 2015, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, with whom he was an assistant coach at the time.

===Carolina Hurricanes (2000-10)===
Following his return from an ankle injury during the 1999–2000 season, Brind&#x27;Amour was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes (along with Jean-Marc Pelletier) in exchange for Keith Primeau.

Brind&#x27;Amour formed one-third of Carolina&#x27;s &quot;BBC Line&quot;, also featuring Bates Battaglia and Erik Cole, during the Hurricanes&#x27; run to the Finals in 2002.

Brind&#x27;Amour was named captain of the Hurricanes before the 2005–06 season and led the Hurricanes to win the Stanley Cup that season, defeating the Edmonton Oilers in the Finals in seven games. During the subsequent off-season, Brind&#x27;Amour signed a five-year contract extension with the Hurricanes.

In November 2006, Brind&#x27;Amour recorded his 1,000th career NHL point, and in February 2007, he scored his 400th career goal.

On February 14, 2008, in a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Brind&#x27;Amour tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the first period, ending his season. However, Brind&#x27;Amour would return for the 2008–09 season, playing in 80 games while recording 16 goals and 35 assists as the Hurricanes reached the Eastern Conference Finals.

On January 20, 2010, Brind&#x27;Amour was replaced as Hurricanes captain by Eric Staal, previously an alternate captain. Brind&#x27;Amour then served as an alternate captain for the remainder of the season. Following the conclusion of the season, Brind&#x27;Amour retired from professional hockey, having played 1,484 career NHL games, after which he moved into Hurricanes&#x27; management as a director of forwards development. His number 17 jersey was retired in a ceremony on February 18, 2011. The ceremony took place prior to a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which at the time was coached by Peter Laviolette. Thus the two teams Brind&#x27;Amour spent the bulk of his career with, as well as the coach he won the Stanley Cup with, were present to honour him. It is the third number to be officially retired by the Hurricanes since moving to Raleigh, North Carolina, after Ron Francis&#x27; number 10 and Glen Wesley&#x27;s number 2. Brind&#x27;Amour was among the last few players in the NHL who had also played in the league during the 1980s. At the time of his retirement, he finished his professional career 18th in all-time NHL games played.

==Coaching career==

On June 7, 2011, Brind&#x27;Amour was introduced by the Carolina Hurricanes as their assistant coach and development coach, retaining his role in developing the franchise&#x27;s forwards while also spending time behind the bench in the NHL.

Brind&#x27;Amour represented the Hurricanes in a ceremony before the Charlotte Checkers&#x27; first home game as Carolina&#x27;s new American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate.

On May 8, 2018, Brind&#x27;Amour was hired as the Hurricanes&#x27; head coach. In his first season as head coach, Brind&#x27;Amour guided the team to its first playoff berth in a decade, leading them to the Eastern Conference finals where they were swept by the Boston Bruins.

On April 26, 2021, Brind&#x27;Amour became the first head coach in Hurricanes history to lead the team to the playoffs in three consecutive seasons. On June 17, Brind&#x27;Amour agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Hurricanes. That same day, Brind&#x27;Amour was awarded the Jack Adams Award, given annually to the NHL&#x27;s coach of the year.

On December 28, 2024, Brind&#x27;Amour became the fastest coach to 300 wins in NHL history, achieving the mark in 488 games, eight games faster than Bruce Boudreau. Brind&#x27;Amour and Boudreau are the only NHL coaches to achieve 300 wins in less than 500 games.

==Personal life==
Brind&#x27;Amour was married to Kelle Sullivan Gardner, with whom he had three children. The couple divorced in 2004.

On July 10, 2010, Brind&#x27;Amour married Amy Biedenbach, the daughter of former North Carolina State University basketball standout and former UNC Asheville men&#x27;s basketball coach, Eddie Biedenbach. The couple have one son together.

Brind&#x27;Amour&#x27;s oldest son, Skyler, was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers 177th overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, and currently plays as a member of the Carolina Hurricanes organization.

<text>Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo (known as Baron Mordo) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly as an adversary of Doctor Strange. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #111 (August 1963). Baron Mordo is a gifted magician, especially adept in the black arts of magic, including summoning demons.

Karl Mordo was studying the magic arts under the Ancient One in Tibet when Dr. Stephen Strange arrived. Strange foiled Mordo&#x27;s plot to kill the Ancient One, leading to Mordo being cast out and Strange eventually becoming Sorcerer Supreme. Mordo has since clashed several times with Dr. Strange, at times with the backing of the demon Dormammu, briefly even impersonating Dr. Strange.

The Baron Mordo character has appeared in other forms of media, such as animated television series, films, and video games. Chiwetel Ejiofor portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (2016) and an alternate universe version in &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
Baron Mordo first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #111 (August 1963), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

==Fictional character biography==
A Transylvanian nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Karl Amadeus Mordo became a student of the Tibetan sorcerer known as the Ancient One. When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot. Mordo was forced to cast restraining spells to prevent Strange from warning the Ancient One. In desperation, Strange decided to accept the Ancient One&#x27;s offer to take him on as his mentor in magic to have some hope of stopping Mordo. The Ancient One, however, was fully aware of Mordo&#x27;s plot and of Strange&#x27;s desire to warn him. Pleased at Strange&#x27;s unselfish decision, the Ancient One&#x27;s magical teachings immediately freed the doctor and explained the full situation. Thus informed in the face of his recent experiences, Strange agreed to become the Ancient One&#x27;s apprentice despite the requirement that he abandon his former life. The Ancient One trained him to be a formidable opponent of Mordo. Eventually Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One. Mordo&#x27;s abilities were similar to those of Doctor Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at astral projection and hypnosis, as well as mesmerism. He was more than willing to use powerful black magic and invoke demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do. Mordo&#x27;s use of these darker arts would sometimes backfire.

The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange. He sent his astral form to hypnotize the Ancient One&#x27;s servant into poisoning his food, hoping the old man would reveal his secrets of magic. However, Strange tricked him into returning to his physical body after engaging in astral contact with him, thus breaking his hold over the servant, who helped the Ancient One to recover. Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange with a drugged candle that paralyzed him, but Strange was able to use his mental powers to call a local girl to free him. He opposed Doctor Strange&#x27;s discipleship to the Ancient One. He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One. Mordo took Strange&#x27;s body while Strange was astral projecting for a threat he sensed that Mordo had caused, and cast a barrier around it, knowing that if his astral form was out for 24 hours it would die. Strange found it in a wax museum, but was unable to enter. However, Strange took control of a wax model in the last minute, distracting Mordo and enabling Strange to return to his body. He imprisoned the Ancient One, but was again defeated. Mordo made a deal with his new master, the demonic Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange. He dispatched agents, other evil magicians around the World and Spirit wraiths, to search for the incognito Strange, and then banished him from the Earth. He fled from Strange, and then dispatched agents to kill Strange. He engaged in personal combat with Strange. Mordo was exiled to the Dimension of Demons by Dormammu. He battled Doctor Strange once more at Stonehenge, but was ultimately banished from Earth.

Mordo would return eventually to continue to bedevil Doctor Strange. He impersonated Doctor Strange during Strange&#x27;s brief retirement, but was soon vanquished. Mordo discovered the Book of Cagliostro, and battled Strange in 18th-century Paris. He then accompanied Strange and Sise-Neg to the dawn of time. After suffering a mental breakdown, he was placed in Doctor Strange&#x27;s care, but later escaped. Mordo transformed the dead Lord Phyffe into Azrael, angel of death, and dispatched him against Strange. He sent the Man-Thing to kill Strange, and assembled thirteen people for human sacrifice to the Chaos Demon. Mordo was defeated by Strange, Jennifer Kale, and the Man-Thing. He attacked Strange, and escaped into the 1940s, but was manipulated by Dormammu.

Mordo later sold his soul to both Mephisto and Satannish for power, gaming that Strange would save him. He was trapped with Sara Wolfe, and later rescued her. Mordo himself was later imprisoned, and Sara Wolfe freed him from imprisonment. Mordo battled Dormammu to defend the Earth. He was defeated, and pretended to ally himself with Dormammu, and then allied himself with Umar to defeat Dormammu.

Umar and Mordo were eventually deposed by Clea. Mordo eventually contracted terminal cancer as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death. He later returned to life. He later allies with Terrax, Tiger Shark and Red Hulk as the &quot;Offenders&quot;, to be opposed by his old rival and newly costumed Doctor Strange, aided by the other three original Defenders.

Mordo appeared in &quot;X-Factor&quot; vol. 3 #203, where it is revealed that he kidnapped politician Cartier St. Croix to lure his daughter Monet St. Croix into a trap.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Quasimodo researched Baron Mordo for Norman Osborn and recommends offering him small favors in exchange for his magical expertise.

Mordo appears to be deceased in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; #6.

Mordo returns during the aftermath of the &quot;Last Days of Magic&quot; arc. Mordo forces a family to leave their residence, but lets the mother stay as his servant. Dormammu incinerates the woman&#x27;s body as he possesses her to chastise Mordo for delaying his plans. Mordo heads to the Sanctum Sanctorum and attacks Wong with Doctor Strange confronting him and the two briefly battle before the latter is taken by Nightmare. Mordo, angered that his foe was taken by another, is confronted by Dormammu again (in the form of a swarm of rats) who proceeds to attack Mordo causing him to leave. He later catches up to Doctor Strange when he is attacked by Orb, until Dormammu arrives. He then helps Doctor Strange in banishing Dormammu directly to Shuma-Gorath.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Baron Mordo becomes the caretaker of Manhattan after it is surrounded by Darkforce following Hydra&#x27;s takeover of the United States. He uses the Sanctum Sanctorum as his residence and has the Elder God Pluorrg guard it. He later catches Daredevil, Luke Cage, Cloak and Iron Fist when they are attempting to fight him. Mordo is then defeated by Doctor Strange, Spider-Woman, Ben Urich, and Kingpin.

In the &quot;Death of Doctor Strange&quot; storyline, Mordo is accused of killing Doctor Strange.

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including hypnotism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth&#x27;s through the recitation of spells. He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do.

Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore.

<doc id="850695" wikidata="Q5467788" url="?curid=850695" title="Ford Fox platform">
<text>The Ford Fox platform is an automobile platform that was used by Ford Motor Company from the 1978 to 1993 model years. Originally introduced to underpin compact sedans, the Fox architecture was utilized for a wide variety of vehicle designs for Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles. Serving as the direct replacement for the long-running Ford Falcon architecture, the downsizing of intermediate-size cars expanded its use, with the Fox platform also replacing the Ford Torino platform. For the 1980s, the chassis came into wider use, supporting both the Ford Mustang and the Ford Thunderbird.

Designed to be relatively lightweight and simple, the Fox platform was a rear-wheel drive chassis that utilized a wide variety of powertrains. Along with the sedans, coupes, and station wagons introduced by the inaugural Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr, models were offered as hatchbacks, convertibles, and as a coupe utility. In addition to pony cars and economy cars, the Fox architecture supported personal luxury cars and luxury sedans. 

As Ford transitioned its compact and mid-size vehicle lines to front-wheel drive, the usage of the Fox platform began to decline during the mid-1980s. In its original form, the architecture was produced through the 1993 model year, with a substantial redesign of the Ford Mustang extending its life into the 21st century, ultimately ending production in 2004. Produced across 26 model years, the Fox platform is the second-longest car architecture ever designed by Ford Motor Company (behind the 33 model years for the Panther platform). 

==Background and development==
In the American automotive industry, 1973 marked a significant period of transition. In May, the EPA released the first comprehensive list of fuel economy data; in addition for providing information for consumers, the data was required to establish protocols for CAFE and gas-guzzler taxes. October 1973 marked the beginning of the first 1970s oil crisis, leading gas prices to increase to per gallon.

Under chairman/CEO Henry Ford II and president Lee Iacocca, several changes were made at the executive level of Ford Motor Company. William O. Bourke, ex-chairman of Ford of Europe and one-time managing director of Ford of Australia, was made executive vice president of North American Operations; Robert Alexander, previously with Ford of Europe as vice president in charge of car development, was moved to same position in the United States. Hal Sperlich was Ford Vice President of Product Planning and Research. 

A proponent of downsizing, Sperlich conceived of a &quot;World Car&quot; that could be sold in both Europe and North America as a solution to the needs of the various divisions. At the time, the Ford small-car product line included the subcompact Pinto and the Mustang II and the compact Maverick; while the Mustang II was several months from release, the Maverick was derived from the Falcon. Lincoln-Mercury sold no small cars of its own, importing the Capri from Ford of Europe. Ford of Europe sold the Escort as its smallest car; Ford UK sold the Cortina while Ford of Germany sold the Taunus

=== Fox platform development ===
In December 1973, Lee Iacocca formally approved development of the Fox platform. Sharing its name with the Audi Fox (although not named after it), Ford executives experienced with the automotive industry outside the United States sought to benchmark a new design from a popular European subcompact design.

Development started in early 1973 on both a short-wheelbase version to replace the Pinto/Cortina/Taunus lines and a long-wheelbase version that would become the Fairmont. Although the Fairmont would be the first Fox-based car to reach the market, development was guided by an anticipated sport coupe to be based on the new platform.

By 1974 the difficulties faced in meeting the conflicting regulatory requirements in different markets and differing production methods used by the various divisions had killed the world-car idea. While unable to replace the Cortina/Taunus, the Fox platform remained a multiple-wheelbase design, as the short-wheelbase version remained in development to replace the Mustang II. In 1975 North American Automobile Operations took over development of the Fox platform from Sperlich&#x27;s Product Planning and Research group.

The first running Fox (Fairmont) prototype was a Cortina with a modified suspension, using MacPherson struts and torsion bars. The torsion bars would not appear in the final version.

== Chassis overview ==
The Fox platform, like most compact and mid-size cars of the late 1970s, was designed with a rear-wheel drive layout. In contrast to the full-size Fords and Mercurys of the time, the Fox platform used unibody construction.

The Fox platform used MacPherson strut front suspension, continuing the use of a live rear axle suspension configuration. Initially configured with rear drum brakes, four-wheel disc brakes were added to higher-performance vehicles, including the Continental Mark VII, Ford Mustang SVO, 1994–2004 Ford Mustang, and the Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe.

Due to the use of strut front suspension, the Fox platform was designed with a wider engine bay than its Falcon-chassis predecessor. As a result, the chassis was flexible in its use of longitudinal engines, accommodating a wide variety of powertrains, including four-cylinder (naturally-aspirated and turbocharged), inline-6, V6, and V8 engines, ranging from a 2.3 L inline-4 to a 5.0 L V8. To further improve the fuel economy of Lincoln Fox-platform vehicles in the 1980s, the platform was adapted for the use of BMW diesel inline-6 engines.

The Fox platform was produced in four separate wheelbases, 100.5 inches (for the Ford Mustang/Mercury Capri; lengthened to 101.3 for the SN95 redesign), 104.2 inches (1983–1988 Thunderbird/Cougar), 105.5 inches (&quot;standard&quot;; sedans/wagons), and 108.5 inches (&quot;long&quot;; 1980 Thunderbird/Cougar XR7/ Continental Mark VII/ Lincoln Mark VII/ Lincoln Continental).

==Design history==

=== 1979-1981 model expansion ===
For 1979, Ford introduced the third-generation Mustang to replace the Pinto-derived Mustang II. Moving to the Fox platform, the Mustang grew slightly in size (closer to the 1964 original), joined by an all-new Mercury Capri (replaced by the unbranded captive-import Capri). Sharing no body panels with the Fairmont, Ford shortened the wheelbase of the Fox chassis by 5 inches for the Mustang. 

For 1980, the Fox platform was expanded further, as it now supported newly downsized versions of the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar XR7, inherited from the discontinued Ford Torino chassis. The redesign debuted a longer-wheelbase variant of the chassis, intended for mid-size cars. In contrast to the well-received Mustang, the redesign of the Thunderbird and Cougar were poorly received, leading to a sales collapse of both models. 

For 1981, the Fox platform replaced the Falcon chassis entirely, as it now supported the second-generation Granada and the Mercury Cougar sedan (which replaced the Monarch); the Lincoln Versailles was discontinued. Sharing the same wheelbase as the Fairmont/Zephyr, the Granada/Cougar featured formal styling elements from full-size Ford and Mercury sedans. In 1982, station wagons were moved from the Fairmont/Zephyr to the Granada/Cougar lines. 

===1983 model year changes===
During the early 1980s, the Fox platform played a central role involving changes to multiple Ford nameplates. The redesigns of the Ford Granada, Ford Thunderbird, and Mercury Cougar (XR7 and sedan) had each fared poorly in the marketplace, leading to a collapse in sales for each nameplate following the 1980 model year. In addition, fuel prices had begun to stabilize as the decade had progressed, shifting consumer demand back towards full-size cars; in response, Ford postponed its intended discontinuation of the full-size Panther-platform vehicles (originally slated for 1985-1986). To rectify the sales collapse and capitalize on the move back towards full-size lines, Ford commenced a multi-year shift of its best-selling vehicle nameplates in all three divisions. 

For 1981, Lincoln saw the first changes (largely to eliminate a large degree of model overlap). The Lincoln Continental (its primary model line) was rechristened as the Lincoln Town Car, with the Continental becoming a mid-size sedan for 1982 (again competing against the Cadillac Seville). After the Mark VI lived out its model cycle, it was replaced by a far more contemporary Continental Mark VII for 1984; both the Mark VII and the Continental shared a wheelbase (but no body panels) with the 1980 Thunderbird. 

For 1983, Ford and Mercury saw extensive changes to their product ranges. In moving their full-size lines upmarket, the full-size sedans became offered only as the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis. As part of a mid-cycle exterior update, the Granada and Cougar were renamed the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. To reverse the sales collapse of both model lines, the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar (now solely a coupe, replacing the previous XR7) underwent complete exterior redesigns, becoming the first Ford vehicles in North America to feature aerodynamically-enhanced body design.

By 1984, the revision effectively tripled the size of the Lincoln model range, along with eliminating the duplication of several Ford and Mercury vehicles (the Ford Fairmont/Granada and Mercury Zephyr/Cougar sedan and wagon). 

===SN-95===

By the early 1990s, the Ford Mustang had become the sole model produced on the Fox platform. For the 1994 model year, as the Mustang underwent a major redesign (under the body family program code name Fox-4), the Fox platform itself saw major changes to its architecture. As part of the upgrade, most of its parts were redesigned carrying over only the floor pan and front suspension cross member with major changes to the suspension and improvements to noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH); the updated Mustang-specific platform became known as the SN-95 platform.

The 2003–2004 Mustang SVT Cobra became the ultimate development of the Fox/SN95 platform, with a 390 hp supercharged 4.6 L DOHC V8. The SN95 platform would be produced for 11 years, extending the life of the Fox platform to 26 years of production. For 2005, the Mustang was completely redesigned, using the all-new Ford D2C platform.

== Discontinuation ==
As the company entered the 1980s, Ford became part of a growing trend among automobile manufacturers using front-wheel drive in its vehicles. For 1984, Ford replaced the Fairmont and Zephyr with the front-wheel drive Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz, using a long-wheelbase of the Ford Escort platform. The 1983 revision of the Mercury Cougar range reverted to its role as a personal coupe (replacing only the 1980-1982 Cougar XR7).

For 1986, the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis were sold alongside their Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable successors until production ended at the end of 1985. In a quieter change, the Mercury Capri was discontinued; Ford no longer produced the Mustang with a divisional counterpart. 

For 1988, the Lincoln Continental became a longer-wheelbase version of the Ford Taurus, ending sedan production on the Fox platform. 

Though the two model lines continued with a rear-wheel drive layout, the all-new MN12 platform replaced the Fox architecture for the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar for 1989; the MN12 design introduced extensive suspension and handling upgrades over the Fox platform. The change left the Lincoln Mark VII (derived from the 1982 Continental; itself, the 1980 Thunderbird) and the Ford Mustang as the final Fox platform vehicles. As the Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII for 1993, the Mustang became the sole Fox-platform produced by Ford.

In its 1978 form, the Fox platform was retired after the 1993 model year. For the fourth-generation Mustang, the Fox platform was given the SN-95 platform designation, following substantial upgrades across much of its design (largely making it a second generation of the architecture). 

==Vehicles==
In total, fifteen distinct vehicles were produced on the Ford Fox platform, with the Ford Fairmont, Mercury Zephyr, Ford Durango, Ford Mustang SVO, and Continental/Lincoln Mark VII produced exclusively on the architecture. The platform would be produced in a variety of body styles, including two-door and four-door sedans, two-door coupes, three-door hatchbacks, five-door station wagons, two-door convertibles (marking the return of the bodystyle to Ford), and a two-door coupe utility (the last coupe utility produced by Ford in North America).

<doc id="850696" wikidata="Q767583" url="?curid=850696" title="Soyuz TM-7">
<text>Soyuz TM-7 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to Mir. It launched on 26 November 1988, at 15:49:34, and was the start of the fourth long duration expedition to Mir, Mir EO-4. The crew would join the third crew member of EO-4, cosmonaut/physician Valeri Polyakov, who was on Mir for the second half of EO-3. Also launched by Soyuz TM-7 was French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien, who would take part in the 24-day French mission known as Mir Aragatz. The spacecraft Soyuz TM-7 remained docked to Mir for the duration of EO-4. At the end of EO-4 in April 1989, due to delays in the launch schedule, Mir was left uncrewed, and all three EO-4 crew members were transported back to Earth.

==Crew==
== Backup crew ==
*Aleksandr Viktorenko
*Aleksandr Serebrov
*Michel Tognini

==Mission parameters==
*Mass: 7,000 kg 15,400 lb
*Perigee: 194 km (120 mi)
*Apogee: 235 km (146 mi)
*Inclination: 51.6°
*Period: 88.8 minutes

==Mission highlights==

The original launch date of November 21 was moved back to permit French president François Mitterrand to view the launch, which was also attended by David Gilmour and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd, who made an audio recording of the event for potential use in a future project. The spacecraft arrived at the Mir station carrying a three-man crew, including French cosmonaut Chrétien on his second flight into space. Titov, Manarov, and Chrétien returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-6. Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev, and Valeri Polyakov remained aboard Mir. On 1989 April 28, they left Mir in mothballs and returned to Earth in Soyuz-TM 7. The Soyuz-TM land landing system is effective at reducing velocity in the vertical direction. However, according to cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, winds at the landing site often impart considerable horizontal velocity. During the rough landing, Krikalev suffered a minor injury to his knee.

Preparations for the first EVA involving a non-Soviet/non-U.S. space traveler forced the cosmonauts to cut short a TV meeting with diplomats from 47 countries on December 8. On December 9, Chrétien and Volkov depressurized the multiport docking adapter and clambered outside Mir. Chrétien was first out. He installed handrails, then attached the 15.5 kg (34 lb) &quot;Échantillons&quot; experiment rack to the handrails by springs and hooks. He also attached electrical wires leading from the rack to Mir&#x27;s power supply. &quot;Échantillons&quot; carried five technological experiments with applications to the Hermes shuttle program. Volkov and Chrétien then assembled the 240 kg (530 lb) experimental deployable structure (known as ERA). They attached a mount to handrails on the frustum linking the multiport docking unit to the small-diameter portion of the work compartment. After resolving problems with cables linking ERA to a control panel inside Mir, they attached the folded ERA structure to a support arm on the platform. The structure was designed to unfold to form a flat six-sided structure 1 metre deep by 3.8 metres across. From inside Mir, Krikalev commanded the structure to unfold, but to no avail. Volkov then kicked ERA, causing it to unfold properly. According to Krikalev, taking the ERA outside helped relieve the crowding problems. The EVA lasted 5 hours and 57 minutes.

The crew took with them a cassette of Pink Floyd&#x27;s newly released live album &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; (minus the cassette box, for weight reasons) and played it in orbit; this was claimed by David Gilmour to have been the first rock music recording in space. The tape was left on Mir when the mission crew returned to Earth.

<text>The J-B Weld Company is an international company that produces epoxy products. The home office is based in Sulphur Springs, Texas. J-B Weld (stylized as J-B WELD) is the name of their flagship product: a specialized, high-temperature epoxy adhesive for use in bonding materials together. The company has run advertisements showing engine block repair with J-B Weld.

The J-B Weld Company, founded in 1969 by Sam Bonham in Sulphur Springs, Texas, specializes in epoxy products. Initially, the company sold to automotive shops in Texas, but now distributes its products across the United States and in 27 other countries through various retail channels. After being purchased by private investors in 2008, the company expanded its product line, which originally included J-B Weld, J-B Kwik, J-B Stik, and Waterweld.

J-B Weld epoxy is a two-part adhesive that can bond various surfaces and withstand high temperatures up to 500 °F (260 °C) constantly and 600 °F (316 °C) for short periods. It is water-resistant, petroleum/chemical-resistant, acid-resistant, and resists shock, vibration, and temperature fluctuations. The product consists of a resin and a hardener that need to be mixed before application. The mixture sets in 4-6 hours and fully cures in up to 15 hours. It can be used as an adhesive, laminate, plug, filler, sealant, or electrical insulator and can be drilled, ground, tapped, machined, sanded, and painted when cured.

J-B Kwik is a faster-curing two-part epoxy with medium-temperature resistance up to 300 °F (149 °C). Although not as strong or heat-resistant as J-B Weld, it has the same adhesion and does not shrink when hardening. J-B Kwik is waterproof, petroleum/chemical-resistant, acid-resistant, and resists shock, vibration, and extreme temperature fluctuations.

==History==
The company had its beginnings in 1969 in Sulphur Springs, Texas. Sam Bonham, at the time running a machine shop, discovered a way to create what he called a &quot;tougher than steel&quot; epoxy. In 1968, Sam&#x27;s future wife Mary persuaded him to sell his invention and he founded the J-B Weld Company. Sam died suddenly in 1989. He had commented before his death, &quot;My life&#x27;s dream is for J-B Weld to be all the way around the world, and for me to see an 18-wheeler load out of here with nothing but J-B Weld.&quot; Within a year of his death, Mary had opened a European hub in London, internationalizing the J-B Weld Company and the distribution of the product.

Initially, the company sold to automotive shops and jobbers in Texas. Now, the J-B Weld Company distributes its products through multiple retail channels - including automotive chains, home improvement centers, hardware stores, and farm stores - and does business in all states in the United States, as well as in 27 other countries. In 2008 the company was purchased by a group of private investors. Led by CEO Chip Hanson, they have expanded the product lines through innovation.

==Products==
The J-B Weld Company&#x27;s original product line focused on a small number of products: J-B Weld (original 2-tube epoxy), (4-hour epoxy), (epoxy putty), Waterweld (underwater adhesive/filler), and a few others.

Since 2008, the company has broadened the product line to add J-B SteelStik, KwikWood, PlasticWeld, MarineWeld, Perm-O-Seal, WoodWeld and ClearWeld.

===J-B Weld epoxy===
J-B Weld is a two-part epoxy adhesive (or filler) that can withstand high-temperature environments.
J-B Weld can be used to bond surfaces made from metal, porcelain, ceramic, glass, marble, PVC, ABS, concrete, fiberglass, wood, fabric, or paper. Alcohol should be avoided when cleaning surfaces, as it can degrade the bond.
J-B Weld is water-resistant, petroleum/chemical-resistant (when hardened), and acid-resistant. It also resists shock, vibration, and extreme temperature fluctuations. J-B Weld can withstand a constant temperature of , and the maximum temperature threshold is approximately for 10 minutes. J-B Weld can also be used inside a microwave oven, exposed to microwave radiation instead of infrared radiation (heat).

The product is contained in 2 separate tubes: the &quot;steel&quot; (black tube of resin) and the &quot;hardener&quot; (red tube). Equal amounts are squeezed from both tubes and mixed. For the best bond, surfaces should be roughened (or scratched) with fine or coarse sandpaper.

When first mixed, J-B Weld is subject to sagging or running (slow dripping); even more so at warmer temperatures. After about 20 minutes the mixture begins to thicken into a putty that can be shaped with a putty knife or wooden spatula.
The mixture will set enough for the glued parts to be handled within 4–6 hours, but requires up to 15 hours at cool temperatures to fully cure and harden. Temperatures above shorten all these times.
After the initial setting period of a few hours, heat (e.g. from a heat lamp or incandescent light bulb placed near the bond) will speed the curing time.

J-B Weld can be used as an adhesive, laminate, plug, filler, sealant, or electrical insulator. When fully cured, J-B Weld can be drilled, formed, ground, tapped, machined, sanded, and painted.

While J-B Weld Original epoxy dries to a dark grey color, J-B Weld&#x27;s ClearWeld epoxy dries clear. Although its bond is not quite as strong as the Original&#x27;s (3900 psi vs. 5020 psi), ClearWeld is often preferred when appearance is an important consideration.

===J-B Kwik epoxy===
J-B Kwik (stylized as J-B KWIK) is a two-part epoxy, intended as an adhesive or filler, that can withstand medium-temperature environments (up to ).

J-B Kwik cures much more quickly, but it is not as strong or as heat-resistant as the original J-B Weld. However, J-B Kwik has the same adhesion () as J-B Weld, and also does not shrink when hardening.

J-B Kwik can be used to bond surfaces made from any combination of iron, steel, copper, aluminum, brass, bronze, pewter, plus porcelain, wood, ceramic, glass, marble, PVC, ABS, concrete, fiberglass, fabric, or paper. J-B Kwik is waterproof, petroleum/chemical-resistant (when cured), acid-resistant; plus resists shock, vibration, and extreme temperature fluctuations.

<text>Mililani Trask is a leader of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, political speaker, and attorney. One of Trask&#x27;s contributions to the Hawaiian sovereignty movement was her founding of Na Koa Ikaika o Ka Lāhui Hawaii, a native Hawaiian non-governmental organization focusing on cultural, social, and economic development, education, health, housing, land entitlements, energy, and water issues.

Outside of Hawaii, Trask has worked with the United Nations to aid indigenous people from around the world seeking independence. She was a member of the Indigenous Initiative for Peace, helped author the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and was elected vice chair of the General Assembly of Nations of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. For seven years, she worked and studied under the guidance of Mother Teresa of Calcutta. She is the younger sister of activist and writer, Professor Haunani-Kay Trask. Mililani graduated Kamehameha Schools in 1969 and earned her JD from Santa Clara University School of Law in 1978.

== Family ==
Mililani Trask was born on the island of Oahu in Honolulu, Hawaii, and she has four siblings. Mililani&#x27;s mother, Haunani Cooper, was a school teacher and Haunani’s mother, Iwalani Haia, worked for the Benevolent Societies on Maui while also engaging in efforts to raise awareness around the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani. Mililani&#x27;s father, Bernard Trask, was a lawyer. Mililani&#x27;s grandfather, David Trask, was the first sheriff in Honolulu and was affiliated with the Territorial Legislature for 26 years. Her uncle, David Trask Jr., was a senator, a state representative, and a leader of the Hawaii Government Employees Association. He was credited for bringing the power of collective bargaining to the union. Her other uncle, Arthur Trask, was a lawyer and political figure for the Democratic Party who was well known for his abilities as an orator and storyteller.

== Office of Hawaiian Affairs ==
Mililani Trask worked for the Office of Hawaiian Affairs from 1998 to 2000 as a Trustee at Large. After the passage of the Rice Decision in 2000 gave non-Hawaiians voting access in OHA elections, Mililani lost her bid for reelection despite the fact that she won the 1998 election by a previously unprecedented number of votes cast by Hawaiians since the formation of OHA in 1978. In 2016 she ran for the Big Island OHA Trustee position on the grounds that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs needed to be more accountable to its beneficiaries. In press interviews and meetings on the topic, she has addressed the need for reform and a change in leadership. Although she did not win the 2016 election, she urged Native Hawaiians to vote.

Mililani Trask has stated that, because the decisions made by OHA impact all of Hawaii, there needs to be more accountability and a focus on the most critical needs of Hawaiians in terms of education, housing, healthcare, incarceration, poverty and jobs instead of political campaigns. Mililani Trask also holds eighteen years of experience with ceded Hawaiian land trusts and affordable housing. 

On February 24, 2022, the OHA Board of Trustees announced the selection of Mililani Trask to replace Keola Lindsey who resigned on February 1.

<doc id="850705" wikidata="Q2627057" url="?curid=850705" title="Feminist geography">
<text>[[Feminist]] geography is a sub-discipline of human geography that applies the theories, methods, and critiques of feminism to the study of the human environment, society, and geographical space. Feminist geography emerged in the 1970s, when members of the women&#x27;s movement called on academia to include women as both producers and subjects of academic work. Feminist geographers aim to incorporate positions of race, class, ability, and sexuality into the study of geography. The discipline was a target for the hoaxes of the grievance studies affair.

==The geography of women==
The geography of women examines the effects geography has on gender inequality and is theoretically influenced by welfare geography and liberal feminism. Feminist geographers emphasize the various gendered constraints put in place by distance and spatial separation (for instance, spatial considerations can play a role in confining women to certain locations or social spheres). In their book &quot;Companion to Feminist Geography&quot;, Seager and Johnson argue that gender is only a narrow-minded approach to understanding the oppression of women throughout the decades of colonial history. As such, understanding the geography of women requires a critical approach to questions of the dimensions of age, class, ethnicity, orientation and other socio-economic factors. An early objection to the concept of geography of women, however, claimed that gender roles were mainly explained through gender inequality. However, Foord and Gregson argue that the idea of gender roles emerges from a static social theory that narrows the focus to women and portrays women as victims, which gives a narrow reading of distance. Instead, they claim that the concept of the geography of women is able to display how spatial constraint and separation enter into the construction of women&#x27;s positions. In 2004, theorist Edward Said critiqued the idea of geographical spaces in such a context where actions on gendered practices of representation are fabricated through dominant ideological beliefs. In response, feminist geographers argue that misrepresentations of gender roles and taken-for-granted feminist movements reveal that the challenges of the colonial present lie within the confinement of women to limited spatial opportunities. Therefore, feminist geographies are built on the principle that gender should be applied and developed in terms of space.

==Socialist feminist geography==
Socialist feminist geography, theoretically influenced by Marxism and Socialist feminism, seeks to explain inequality, the relationship between capitalism and patriarchy, and the interdependence of geography, gender relations, and economic development under capitalism. Socialist feminist geography revolves around questions of how to reduce the gender inequality caused by patriarchy and capitalism, and focuses predominantly on spatial separation, gender place, and locality. Uncertainty regarding appropriate articulation of gender and class analysis fuels a key theoretical debate within the field of socialist feminist geography. For example, when analyzing married mainland Chinese immigrant women living in New York City, women remain the primary object of analysis, and gender remains the primary social relation. However, socialist feminist geographers also recognize that many other factors, such as class, affect women&#x27;s post-migration experiences and circumstances.

Socialist feminist geographers first worked primarily at the urban scale: Anglo-American feminist geographers focused on the social and spatial separation of suburban homes from paid employment. This was seen as vital to the day-to-day and generational development and maintenance of traditional gender relations in capitalist societies.

Socialist feminist geographers also analyze the ways in which the effects of geographical differences on gender relations not only reflect, but also partly determine local economic changes. Judith Butler&#x27;s concept of &quot;citationality&quot; explores the lack of agency surrounding the facilitation of the presence of women within the discipline of geography. Subsequently, feminist geographers conclude that whenever performative measures are taken to diminish women&#x27;s rights in geographical space, surrounding conventions adapt to make it seem as the norm. For instance, Susan Hanson and Geraldine Pratt&#x27;s book &quot;Gender, Work, and Space&quot; reveals how geographical elements, such as the configuration of workplaces, the distribution of resources, and the design of urban and rural environments, contribute to shaping and reinforcing gender disparities within the realm of work.

==Feminist geographies of difference==
Feminist geographies of difference is an approach to feminist geography that concentrates on the construction of gendered identities and differences among women. It examines gender and constructions of nature through cultural, post-structural, postcolonial and psychoanalytic theories, as well as writings by women of color, lesbian women, gay men, and women from third world countries. In this approach, feminist geographers emphasize the study of micro-geographies of body, mobile identities, distance, separation and place, imagined geographies, colonialism and post-colonialism, and environment or nature.

Since the late 1980s, many feminist geographers have moved on to three new research areas: categories of gender between men and women, the formation of gender relations and identities, and the differences between relativism and situational knowledge. 

Firstly, feminist geographers have contested and expanded the categories of genders between men and women. Through this, they have also begun to investigate differences in the constructions of gender relations across race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexuality and nationality, paying particular attention to women who are positioned along multiple axes of difference.

Secondly, to gain a better understanding of how gender relations and identities are formed and assumed, feminist geographers have drawn upon a broader extent of social theory and culture. Building upon this theoretical platform, feminist geographers are more able to discuss and debate the influence that post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories have on multiple identifications.

Lastly, the difference between relativism and situated knowledge is a key area of discussion. Through these discussions, feminist geographers have discovered ways to reconcile partial perspectives with a commitment to political action and social change.

==Critical human geography==
Critical human geography is defined as &quot;a diverse and rapidly changing set of ideas and practices within human geography linked by a shared commitment to emancipatory politics within and beyond the discipline, to the promotion of progressive social change and to the development of a broad range of critical theories and their application in geographical research and political practice.&quot;

Critical human geography emerged from the field of Anglophonic geography in the mid-1990s, and it presents a broad alliance of progressive approaches to the discipline. Critical human geographers focus on key publications that mark different eras of critical human geography, drawing upon anarchism, anti-colonialism, critical race theory, environmentalism, feminism, Marxism, nonrepresentational theory, post-Marxism, post-colonialism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, queer theory, situationism, and socialism.

Critical human geography is understood as being multiple, dynamic, and contested.

Rather than a specific sub-discipline of geography, feminist geography is often considered part of a broader, postmodern, critical theory approach, that draws upon the theories of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Judith Butler, and many post-colonial theorists. Feminist geographers often focus on the lived experiences of individuals and groups in the geographies of their own localities, rather than theoretical development without empirical work.

Many feminist geographers study the same subjects as other geographers, but focus specifically on gender divisions. This has developed into concerns with wider issues of gender, family, sexuality, race, and class. Examples of areas of focus include:
* Geographic differences in gender relations and gender equality
* The geography of women (e.g. spatial constraints and welfare geography)
* The construction of gender identity through the use and nature of spaces and places
* Geographies of sexuality (queer theory)
* Geographies of disability
* Children&#x27;s geographies

Feminist geographers are also deeply impacted by and respondent to contemporary globalization and neoliberal discourses that are manifested transnationally and translocally.

Feminist geography also critiques human geography and other academic disciplines, arguing that academic structures have been traditionally characterized by a patriarchal perspective and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the masculine bias of academic study. British geographer Gillian Rose&#x27;s &quot;Feminism and Geography&quot; is one such sustained criticism that claims that the approach to human geography in Britain is historically masculinist. This geographic masculinization includes traditions of writing landscapes as feminine spaces—and thus as subordinate to male geographers—and subsequent assumptions of a separation between mind and body. Johnston &amp; Sidaway describe such separation as &quot;Cartesian dualism&quot; and further explain its influence on geography:

Other feminist geographers have interrogated how the discipline of geography itself represents and reproduces the heterosexual male gaze. Feminist geographers such as Katherine McKittrick have asserted that how we see and understand space are fundamentally bound up in how we understand the hegemonic presence of the white male subject in history, geography and in the materiality of everyday space. Building off of Sylvia Wynter&#x27;s theories of the racialized production of public and private space, McKittrick challenges &quot;social landscapes that presume subaltern populations have no relationship to the production of space&quot; and writes to document black female geographies in order to &quot;allow us to engage with a narrative that locates and draws on black histories and black subjects in order to make visible social lives which are often displaced, rendered ungeographic.&quot; McKittrick stakes claim in the co-articulation of race and gender as they articulate space, writing: &quot;I am emphasizing here that racism and sexism are not simply bodily or identity-based; racism and sexism are also spatial acts and illustrate black women&#x27;s geographic experiences and knowledges as they are made possible through domination.&quot; Moreover, many feminist geographers have critiqued human geography for centering masculine knowledge emphasizing &quot;objective&quot; knowledge, arguing instead for the use of situated knowledge which understands both observation and analysis as being rooted in partial objectivity.

==Challenges of feminist geography==
Linda McDowell and Joanne P. Sharp, both foundational feminist geographers and scholars, describe the struggle of gaining recognition in academia, saying that &quot;[it has been] a long struggle to gain recognition within geography as a discipline that gender relations are a central organizing feature both of the material and symbolic worlds and of the theoretical basis of the discipline.&quot; Feminist geographers struggle in academia in a variety of ways. Firstly, ideas that originate from feminist discourse are often seen as commonsense once the wider field accepts them, thereby rendering geography that is explicitly feminist invisible. Furthermore, feminist geography is understood to be the only subfield of geography where gender is explicitly addressed, permitting the wider discipline to disengage from feminist challenges. Finally, within the field, some geographers believe that feminist practice has been fully integrated into the academy, making feminist geography obsolete.

Challenges of feminist geography are also embedded in the subfield itself. The epistemology of feminist geography argues that the positionalities and lived experiences of the geographers are as central to scholarship as what is being researched. In this way, feminist geographers must maintain diverse identities to fully engage with the discipline. Linda Peake and Gill Valentine point out that, while feminist geography has addressed gender issues in more than twenty-five countries across the world, scholarship in the field of feminist geography is primarily conducted by white female scholars from institutions in the Global North. In this way, feminist geography faces not only barriers rooted in the academy but a lack of diversity in its own field.

Feminist geographers draw upon a broad range of social and cultural theory, including psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, to develop a fuller understanding of how gender relations and identities are shaped and assumed. This has led to the fundamental rethinking of gender and the contradictions and possibilities presented by the seeming instability and insistent repetitions of gender norms in practice. The focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories has allowed feminist geographers to enter into dialogue with other strands of critical geography. This open dialogue, however, has also allowed tensions to build between geographers in the United States and geographers in Great Britain. Theoretical differences among feminist geographers are more obvious than in the past, but since 1994, the national differences between America and British geographers have begun to diminish as both parties pursue new directions.

==Controversies surrounding feminist geography==
In 2018, a leading journal in feminist geography entitled &quot;Gender, Place and Culture&quot; was subject to a scholarly publishing hoax known as the Grievance studies affair. James A. Lindsay, Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose disingenuously submitted a paper titled &quot;Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity in Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon.&quot; The paper proposed that dog parks are &quot;rape-condoning spaces&quot;, and a place of rampant canine rape culture and systemic oppression against &quot;the oppressed dog&quot; through which human attitudes to both problems can be measured and analyzed by applying black feminist criminology. The paper suggested that this could provide insight into training men out of sexual violence and bigotry. The paper has since been retracted. The hoax has been criticized as unethical and mean-spirited, as well as race-baiting and misogynist and critics of the hoax have suggested that the hoaxers misrepresented the process of peer review.

<text>Soyuz TM-8 was a 1989 spaceflight which carried the fifth long duration crew to the Soviet space station Mir. It was part of the Soyuz-TM series of spacecraft, which were the fourth generation of the Soviet Soyuz. Soyuz TM-8 was the eighth crewed spaceflight to Mir, and spent 166 days in orbit.

==Crew==
The crew consisted of two Soviet cosmonauts. They had both been in space, but only Viktorenko had previously been to Mir, which was a 7-day visit during Mir EP-1.

==Launch and docking==
The Soyuz-U2 rocket was painted with advertisements. During the Soyuz spacecraft&#x27;s final approach to Mir (4 metre distance), the Kurs rendezvous and docking system malfunctioned, so Viktorenko took over manual control and withdrew to 20 metres, and then docked manually. The spacecraft spent 166 days attached to Mir, for the duration of the expedition Mir EO-5.

==Return to Earth==

Soyuz TM-8 landed at 04:36 UTC on 19 February 1990, after an uneventful flight to Earth.

<text>The Achilles was an English shaft drive voiturette manufactured by B Thompson &amp; Co. in Frome, Somerset between 1903 and 1908.

A range of cars were advertised, mostly with single-cylinder engines by Aster and De Dion. Other mechanical parts were also bought in, and it seems likely that only the bodies were originated by Achilles. At least 5 different models were produced including the 8 hp, 9 hp and 12 hp.

This car is notably seen in the French comic book Achille Talon, created by Michel Regnier (known by the pseudonym Greg), for the Pilote redaction.

<doc id="850719" wikidata="Q4674388" url="?curid=850719" title="Acme (automobile)">
<text>The Acme was a make of American automobiles made in Reading, Pennsylvania from 1903 to 1911. They were the successor of the Reber which was made from 1902 to 1903 by Reber Manufacturing.

==Etymology==
Acme (ακμή; English transliteration: &quot;akmē&quot;) is Ancient Greek for &quot;(highest) point, edge; peak of anything&quot;, being used in English with the meaning of &quot;prime&quot; or &quot;the best&quot;, initially when referring to a period in someone&#x27;s life and then extending to anything or anyone who reaches perfection in a certain regard.

==History==
In June 1903 James C. Reber acquired the old Acme Machine Company&#x27;s bicycle factory on the corner of Eighth and Elm Streets, Reading for US$47,000 at a receivership auction of the American Bicycle Company. Reber owned Reber Manufacturing, an automobile manufacturer, and stated that he was going to use the factory to manufacture automobiles. With the purchase of this site Reber also announced that Reber Manufacturing was changing its name to the Acme Motor Car Company. The company&#x27;s directors were James C Reber, George D Horst, Jacob Nolde, and John D Horts. The company had $200,000 capital. Leon Schermerhorn was hired as Sales Manager.

Initial output in 1903 was four to six cars per week with the intention of reaching a production of 500 cars per annum. By 1905 they were producing between two or three automobiles daily.

Acme exhibited its cars at the Chicago and New York Automobile Shows from 1904 to 1907. The company was one of the founding members of the American Motor Car Manufacturers Association.

===Frank Devlin===
In November 1905 the company was taken over by Frank A Devlin of Devlin and Co, Chicago. Devlin owned Carson, Pirie, Scott, and Co one of America&#x27;s largest jobbing houses. The purchase price was rumored to have been $250,000. The new owners intended to specialize in tourist cars (a touring car, limousine, and landaulette) and delivery wagons.

In October 1908 Devlin was killed in an automobile accident.

===James C Reber===
James C Reber went to work for the Keystone Wagon Works in February 1907 as General Manager on a 10-year contract, but they went into receivership in November sparking a lawsuit from Reber which he won. Reber went into poultry farming from that period until 1911, when he began a wholesale tobacco business. Reber died after a period of illness in 1933 aged 65.

==Demise==

===Receivership (1906)===
The firm went into receivership in July 1906 with Daniell J Driscoll appointed receiver by the Court. The plant was kept in operation by the receiver to ensure a reasonable return to its debtors. The business was sold in February 1907 by the receiver to Herbert M Sternbergh for $65,881.12. Sternbergh held interests in the Duryea Power Company. The registered capital was reduced to $5,000.

===Herbert Sternbergh era===
Acme introduced its first 6-cylinder car, a touring car called the &quot;Sextuplet&quot;, at the New York motor show in September 1907. Acme also increased its involvement in motor racing through 1908. In 1909 it introduced a 10-year guarantee on its 6-cylinder models.

In May 1909 an ocean to ocean endurance race, from New York to Seattle was proposed. Sternbergh strongly supported the idea, especially as it would draw attention to the poor condition of transcontinental roading. He hoped it would lead to significant improvements.

===James Hervey Sternbergh===
Acme sold its site and plant to J H Sternbergh for $72,100 in May 1911. Sternbergh in turn sold the Acme Motor Car Company and leased the plant to a New York consortium. The company&#x27;s name was changed to SGV. Sternbergh died in March 1913.

==Production==
When the company commenced production at the Elm Street plant it initially planned to make 4 to 6 vehicles per week, with the aim of increasing output to 500 machines per annum. Leon Schermerhorn was appointed sales manager. By 1905 the company was employing 170 men. The plant in Elm Street was sold to F A Devlin of Chicago in June.

In 1907 the company began to test vanadium steel alloy for use in its car parts. They were also using sprags, a bar inserted between the spokes of the wheels as an additional safety mechanism to hold the car in position if it was parked on a slope.

By September 1907 Acme is thought to have made 520 cars since production began at its Elm Street plant. From April 1908 Krupp nickel-steel was used in construction of its transmissions. At that time they also used Eisemann high tension magnetos, Exide batteries, Prestolite gas tanks, and Neverout lamps.

The company&#x27;s output was quite low with only between 125-150 cars planned in 1909.

==Acme Models==
Types I, II, III are possibly Reber&#x27;s.

===Type IV Model A===
Marketed as the Reber, the 1903 Acme was a tonneau powered by a 12 hp vertical-twin engine fitted to a three speed transmission and double chain drive. It was advertised as costing $1,800. The car weighed 1,650 pounds. Its wheelbase was 78 inches and its width was 54 inches.

===Type V - Touring Car (1904)===
A 16 hp car that was advertised for sale at $1,650.

===Type VI (1905)===
This model sold for $2,000. It had a 16-horsepower two-cylinder engine. It had an 84-inch wheelbase on a steel chassis. This type was offered with the option of three different bodies styles; a standard touring car, a delivery body, or an enclosed opera sedan.

===Type VIII (1905)===
A 30 hp with top and headlights and 4 speed transmission. Priced at $2,750.

===Type IX (1905)===
This type sold for $800. It had a single-cylinder 9 horsepower engine on steel chassis with a 76-inch wheel base.

===Type X Runabout (1905)===
A 16 hp two seater with a three speed transmission and semi-racing body advertised at $1,000.

===Type XIV (1906)===
In 1906, the company was advertising a 5-passenger tonneau in a national trade magazine. Model XIV was a 4-cylinder water cooled 30 to 35-horsepower motor and was priced at US$2,750 with maximum speed of . It had a wood body on a pressed steel frame, three speed transmission, double drive chain. Its tank held 18 gallons of petrol. The car weighed 2,200 lbs.

The company entered the car in the 360 mile long race at Savannah on 18–19 March with Malcolm Newstetter replacing Ed L&#x27;Engle as its driver. It also announced that they intended to enter their cars in hill climbing and endurance races, but not &quot;races where chance plays a large part&quot;. The Acme car came third in a time of 6:47:05. It was beaten by an Italian Isotta Fraschini (6:21:20) and an Apperson (6:44:37).

Acme cars competed in the Land&#x27;s End Economy Run of the Long Island Automobile Club in early 1908.

Following its good placing in the Savannah race, Acme entered a car in the 1908 Vanderbilt Cup race and began negotiations with Lewis Strang for its driver. The car was to be specially constructed for the race with a larger bore engine than normal. The same car was entered in the Grand Prix of the Automobile Club of America at Savannah with Leonard Zengle as its driver.

A Type XIX won a hill climb at Wilkes-Barre and three events at the New York-based Jamaica speed trials in May or June 1908.

A private owner J H Tyson entered a Type XXI driven by professional Strang in the 1908 Brighton Beach 24 hour race. Acme entered a Type XXV. The car was to be driven by Cyrus Patchke and was also entered in the Fairmount Park 200 mile race on 10 October. A Acme Type XXI came second in the race.

<text>Robert Edmund Cormier (January 17, 1925 – November 2, 2000) was an American writer and journalist, known for his deeply pessimistic novels, many of which were written for young adults. Recurring themes include abuse, mental illness, violence, revenge, betrayal, and conspiracy. In most of his novels, the protagonists do not win.

Cormier&#x27;s more popular works include &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot;, &quot;After the First Death&quot;, &quot;We All Fall Down&quot;, and &quot;The Chocolate War&quot;, all of which have won awards. &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; has been challenged in multiple libraries.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Cormier was born in 1925 in Leominster, Massachusetts in the French-Canadian section of the town called French Hill. He was the second of eight children. His family moved frequently to afford rent, but never left his hometown. Even when he was much older and owned a summer home, it was only away from Leominster. In a few of his books, Cormier&#x27;s hometown of Leominster became the fictional town of Monument, and its village of French Hill became Frenchtown. The nearby city of Fitchburg, Massachusetts became Wickburg.

Cormier attended St. Cecilia&#x27;s Parochial School, a private Catholic school. He began writing when he was in the first grade and was praised at school for his poetry. He first realized his aspiration to become a writer in 7th grade, when he was encouraged by a nun to write a poem. He attended Leominster High School, graduating as the president of his class.

As a freshman at Fitchburg State College, Cormier had his first short story published when a college professor, Florence Conlon, without his knowledge, sent one of his stories to a national Catholic magazine &quot;The Sign&quot; for $75.

==Career==
Cormier began his professional writing career scripting radio commercials. He eventually became an award-winning journalist. Even though he became widely known, he never stopped writing for his local newspaper, the &quot;Fitchburg Sentinel&quot;.

Cormier became a full-time writer after the success of his first adult novel for teenagers, &quot;Now and at the Hour&quot; (1960); others followed, such as &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; and &quot;After the First Death&quot;. He was concerned with the problems facing young people in modern society, which was reflected in his novels. He soon established a reputation as a brilliant and uncompromising writer. His awards include the Margaret A. Edwards Award of the Young Adult Services Division of the American Library Association, a lifetime award that recognizes a particular body of work that provides young adults with a window through which they can view the world, and which will help them to grow and understand themselves and their role in society. Cormier won the annual award in 1991, citing &quot;The Chocolate War&quot;; &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot;; and &quot;After the First Death&quot;.

&quot;The Chocolate War&quot; has been challenged in various libraries and schools for its language and its depictions of sexual activity, secret societies, and anarchic students. Between 1990 and 2000 it was the fourth most frequently challenged book in the US, according to the American Library Association.

== Awards ==
In 1991, The American Library Association bestowed its Margaret Edwards Award to &quot;I Am the Cheese&quot;, citing it as one of three 1974 to 1979 books &quot;taken to heart by young adults over a period of years.” The ALA said that &quot;Cormier&#x27;s brilliantly crafted and troubling novels have achieved the status of classics in young adult literature.&quot;

&quot;I Am the Cheese&quot; won the 1997 Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association. Named for the mythical bird, the Phoenix Award recognizes the best English language children&#x27;s book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier.

==Death ==
Cormier died on November 2, 2000, due to complications from a blood clot.

<text>Joseph Patrice Brisebois (born January 27, 1971) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman for the Montreal Canadiens and Colorado Avalanche, playing nearly 900 games with the former and 1,009 games overall. Brisebois was recently the Canadiens&#x27; Director of Player Development.

==NHL playing career==
Brisebois was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the second round, 30th overall, of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. He played junior hockey for the Laval Titan and Drummondville Voltigeurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and for the Fredericton Canadiens of the American Hockey League (AHL) during his first year of professional ice hockey. Brisebois&#x27;s junior career was an unqualified success. In 1990–91, he captured the Emile Bouchard Trophy awarded to the best defencemen in the QMJHL, was named to the QMJHL All-Star team, and took home the award for the Canadian Hockey League (CHL)&#x27;s Best Defencemen.

He has played for the Canadiens for 14 seasons, winning one Stanley Cup with the franchise during the 1992–93 season. By 1999, Brisebois had become a staple of the Habs defence, specifically as their power play anchor. Brisebois was rewarded for his strong play with a hefty $12 million/3 years contract.

Brisebois later fell out with the Montreal fans. With his hefty contract came many expectations and the general consensus was that Brisebois was not earning his salary. His defensive vulnerability as a risk-taking offensive defenceman became a topic of contention.

As a free agent following the NHL lockout in 2004–05, Brisebois left the Canadiens to sign with the Colorado Avalanche in a two-year deal on August 3, 2005. Away from the previous pressures, Brisebois then enjoyed a career year statistically scoring a career-high 38 points with the Avalanche in the 2005–06 season.

On August 3, 2007, Brisebois, again a free agent, returned to the Montreal Canadiens, accepting a one-year incentive-laden deal for the 2007–08 season. At the end of the 2008 season the Habs extended Brisebois to further one-year deal.

Brisebois played his 1000th Career NHL game for the Montreal Canadiens on March 14, 2009 at the Bell Centre against the New Jersey Devils. This feat was eclipsed that night because Martin Brodeur reached Patrick Roy&#x27;s 551 victories. However, he was awarded a prize from the vice-president of the NHL as well as a silver stick given to him by Henri Richard.

On September 24, 2009, Brisebois announced his retirement after an 18-year career in the National Hockey League. On the same day, he also received the Jean-Béliveau Trophy awarded annually to a Canadiens player for his contribution in the community. Brisebois ranks third all-time in games played for the Canadiens as a defenceman, lacing up 896 times.

==Racing career==

Brisebois was not signed for the 2009–2010 NHL season. He decided to buy a NASCAR Canada car and race in two NASCAR Canada races in August 2009.

Brisebois entered the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series&#x27; 2009 GP3R 100 at Circuit Trois-Rivières, and pulled out before the end due to heat exhaustion.

Brisebois qualified in 15th for the NAPA Autopro 100 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a support race for the NASCAR Nationwide Series&#x27; NAPA Auto Parts 200. He finished in 12th place.

==Front office career==
On June 13, 2012 the Montreal Canadiens announced that Brisebois had joined the organization as Director of Player Development. On July 17, 2014, Brisebois stepped down from his position as Director of Player Development, citing family reasons.

<doc id="850740" wikidata="Q1964223" url="?curid=850740" title="Suffix (name)">
<text>A name suffix in the Western English-language naming tradition, follows a person&#x27;s surname (last name) and provides additional information about the person. Post-nominal letters indicate that the individual holds a position, educational degree, accreditation, office, or honor (e.g. &quot;PhD&quot;, &quot;CCNA&quot;, &quot;OBE&quot;). Other examples include generational designations like &quot;Sr.&quot; and &quot;Jr.&quot; and &quot;I&quot;, &quot;II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, etc.

== Post-nominal letters ==

=== Academic ===
Academic suffixes indicate the degree earned at a college or university. These include bachelor&#x27;s degrees (AB, BA, BS, BE, BFA, BTech, LLB, BSc, etc.), master&#x27;s degrees (MA, MS, MFA, LLM, MLA, MBA, MSc, MEng etc.), professional doctorates (JD, MD, DO, PharmD, DMin, etc.), and academic doctorates (PhD, EdD, DPhil, DBA, LLD, EngD, etc.)

In the case of doctorates, normally either the prefix (e.g. &quot;Dr&quot; or &quot;Atty&quot;) or the suffix (see examples above) is used, but not both. In the United States, the suffix is the preferred format (thus allowing differentiation between types of doctorate) in written documentation.
=== Honorary ===
Such titles may be given by:

* a monarch (for example, KBE, a suffix granted to Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire);
* a university (as in a LLD (Doctor of Laws) given in recognition of a person&#x27;s life achievements rather than their academic standing);
* a church or seminary, who may offer an honorary Doctor of Divinity (DD) to outstanding ministers or teachers.

==== Esquire ====
The style &quot;Esq.&quot; or &quot;Esquire&quot; was once used to distinguish a man who was an apprentice to a knight and is used for a man of socially high ranking. In the United States, &quot;Esq.&quot; is used as a professional styling for a licensed attorney. In the United Kingdom, it is largely obsolete but occasionally used by untitled males in social and business contexts.

=== Professional ===
Professional titles include Esq., often used for an attorney (but not necessarily) in the United States who has passed a state bar examination, and CSA (casting) and ASCAP, which indicate membership in professional societies. The suffix CA is used for individuals who have completed the requirements to become a Chartered Accountant. The suffix CPA is also used for individuals who have completed the requirements to become a Certified Public Accountant. Similarly, Chartered Financial Analysts use the suffix CFA. Sommeliers (restaurant wine professionals) who have passed the Master Sommelier exam use the MS suffix. Engineers that are certified as a Professional Engineer in his or her state will use the suffix PE (PEng in Canada), Certified Professional Geologists use PG, Certified Professional Logisticians use CPL, and Chartered Engineers use CEng. Likewise, Registered Architects sometimes use the suffix RA, or more often a suffix such as AIA or RIBA that refers to their professional society. Examination Office personnel within the United Kingdom who are registered with the Examination Officers&#x27; Association use MEOA. In the United States, professional archaeologists registered with the Register of Professional Archaeologists use the suffix RPA.

Project managers that have obtained certification as Project Management Professionals from the Project Management Institute may use the suffix PMP after their name. Similarly, individuals who hold certifications in the field of information security—e.g. CISA, CISSP, and/or CISM—may use them as suffixes.

The suffix PT is used by Physical Therapists to denote their state certification, but not to be confused with DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy) which is a qualifying degree. British physiotherapists prefer to use MCSP or SRP to denote membership to professional bodies. RN is used by qualified nurses as a suffix.

Officers and enlisted in the United States Military will add an abbreviation of the service frequently to disambiguate seniority, and reserve status. For example, Captain Smith, USN (O-6), outranks Captain Jones, USMC (O-3).

Red Seal certified trades people in Canada can use the Red Seal Endorsement (RSE) acronym.

=== Religious orders ===
Members of religious institutes commonly use their institute&#x27;s initials as a suffix. For example, a Franciscan friar uses the post-nominal initials OFM, derived from the order&#x27;s name in Latin, (Order of Friars Minor). Equally, a Viatorian priest uses the suffix &quot;CSV&quot; from the name of his religious institute, (Clerics of Saint Viator). These initials are not considered by members of religious institutes as an equivalent to academic or honorary post-nominial initials, but rather as a sign of membership in a particular religious lineage.

=== Ordering ===
In some English-speaking countries, the arrangement of post-nominal letters is governed by rules of precedence, and this list is sometimes called the &quot;Order of Wear&quot; (for the wearing of medals).

== Generational titles ==
Generational suffixes are used to distinguish persons who share the same name within a family. A generational suffix can be used informally (for disambiguation purposes or as nicknames) and is often incorporated in legal documents.

=== United States ===
In the United States the most common name suffixes are &quot;senior&quot; and &quot;junior&quot;, which are abbreviated as &quot;Sr.&quot; and &quot;Jr.&quot; with initial capital letters, with or without preceding commas. In Britain these are rarer, but when they are used the abbreviations are &quot;Snr&quot; and &quot;Jnr&quot;, respectively. The use of these social terms is governed by etiquette but not enshrined in law. According to The Emily Post Institute, an authority on etiquette, the term &quot;Jr.&quot; can be correctly used only if a male child&#x27;s first, middle, and last names are identical to his father&#x27;s (current) names. When a male child has the same name as his grandfather, uncle or male cousin, but not his father, he can use the &quot;II&quot; suffix, which is pronounced &quot;the second&quot;. (In rare cases, the &quot;II&quot; suffix may be used for a son, e.g. former American president Barack Hussein Obama II and his father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr. The example of Obama Sr., born Baraka Obama, also shows that suffixes are based on the father&#x27;s current legal name and not necessarily their birth name.) When the suffixes are spelled out in full, they are not capitalized. Social name suffixes are far more frequently applied to men than to women. A child with a name that varies from a parent&#x27;s name in middle name only may also be informally known as Jr. (e.g. Francis Wayne Sinatra, son of Francis Albert Sinatra), and his father may be known informally as Sr. (e.g., Paul John Teutul and his son, Paul Michael Teutul). Roman numeral suffixes can be used to name a child after another family member like an uncle, cousin, or ancestor (including grandfather or great-grandfather). For example, Quentin Roosevelt II was named for his late uncle, Quentin I. Similarly, a grandson of Henry Ford I was named Henry II (the name again skipped a generation with the birth of Henry II&#x27;s grandson, Henry Ford III).

Historically, when child mortality was high, a child could be named for its deceased sibling (a necronym), with or without a suffix (such was the case of Salvador Dalí). There is at least one known case of multiple siblings having the same name in modern times—that of George Foreman&#x27;s five sons, including eldest George Jr. and youngest George VI.

The suffix &quot;III&quot; is used after either &quot;Jr.&quot; or &quot;II&quot; and, like subsequent numeric suffixes, does not need to be restricted to one family line. For example, if Randall and Patrick Dudley are brothers and if Randall has a son before Patrick, he may call his son &quot;Patrick II&quot;. If Patrick now has a son, his son is &quot;Patrick Jr.&quot; (or &quot;Patrick III&quot;; alternatively, &quot;Patrick II&quot; if Randall did not have a son named Patrick II). As time passes, the &quot;III&quot; suffix goes to the son of either Patrick Jr. or Patrick II, whoever is first to have a son named Patrick. This is one way it is possible and correct for a Junior to father a IV. Another example involves President Ulysses S. Grant and his sons Frederick, Ulysses Jr., and Jesse. When Frederick&#x27;s son Ulysses was born in 1881, Ulysses Jr. did not yet have a son named after himself. Therefore, Frederick&#x27;s son was Ulysses III. Ulysses Jr.&#x27;s son, born afterwards in 1893, was Ulysses IV. Jesse&#x27;s son Chapman was the father of Ulysses V, as neither Ulysses III nor Ulysses IV had sons named for themselves.

There is no hard-and-fast rule over what happens to suffixes when the most senior of the name dies. Etiquette expert and humorist Judith Martin, for example, believes they should all move up (as &quot;Sr.&quot; and subsequent suffixes can be redistributed), but most agree that this is up to the individual families.

There are instances of daughters being named after their mothers and also using the suffix &quot;Jr.&quot; (such as Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Jr., Winifred Sackville Stoner Jr., and Carolina Herrera Jr.) or after their grandmothers or aunts with the suffix &quot;II&quot;, but this is not common. Usually, the namesake is given a different middle name and so would not need a suffix for differentiation. Furthermore, once the woman marries, she would most commonly take the surname of her husband and thus do away with the generational suffix. The title &quot;Jr.&quot; is sometimes used in legal documents, particularly those pertaining to wills and estates, to distinguish among female family members of the same name.

A wife who uses the title &quot;Mrs.&quot; often would also use her husband&#x27;s full name, including the suffix. In less formal situations, the suffix may be omitted: Mrs. Lon Chaney Jr. on a wedding invitation but Mrs. L. Chaney or simply Shannon Chaney for a friendly note. Widows are conventionally entitled to retain their late husband&#x27;s full names and suffixes, but divorcées do not continue to style themselves with a former husband&#x27;s full name and suffix even if they retain the surname.

Juniors sometimes go by their first initials and &quot;J&quot; for Jr. regardless of middle initial. Examples include American football players Terrell Ray Ward Jr. (who goes by T. J. Ward) and Erick R. Manuel Jr., who is better known as EJ Manuel.

Former Major League Baseball player B. J. Upton, whose real name is Melvin Emanuel Upton Jr., is called B. J. due to his father&#x27;s nickname being &quot;Bossman&quot;; B. J. stands for &quot;Bossman Junior&quot;.

Common nicknames for a junior or II include &quot;Chip&quot; (as in &quot;chip off the old block&quot;); e.g., President James Earl Carter Jr.&#x27;s second son James Earl Carter III goes by &quot;Chip&quot;. Another is &quot;Bud&quot; (predominantly in the American South); e.g., Marlon Brando Jr.&#x27;s childhood nickname was &quot;Bud&quot;. Another alternative is &quot;Skip&quot;; e.g., Harry &quot;Skip&quot; Caray Jr. and Harry Christopher &quot;Chip&quot; Caray III, or &quot;Skip&quot; may imply that the name skips a generation. Common nicknames for a III are &quot;Trip(p)&quot;, &quot;Trace&quot;, and &quot;Trey&quot; which denote that the name carrier is the third person to carry the name. Notable examples include Green Day drummer Tré Cool (Frank Edwin Wright III), &quot;South Park&quot; co-creator Trey Parker (Randolph Severn Parker III), and Trey Smith (Willard Carroll Smith III), elder son of actor Will Smith (Willard Carroll Smith II).

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the suffixes &quot;Snr&quot; and &quot;Jnr&quot; are rare, and not usually considered part of a person&#x27;s name as such. Ordinal suffixes such as &quot;III&quot; are generally reserved for monarchs; however, the General Register Office has stated that, whereas it would normally reject a string of symbols or letters that &quot;has no intrinsic sense of being a name&quot; when registering a child, a suffix such as &quot;III&quot; would be accepted. Those who inherit a title of nobility do not use ordinal suffixes, but are distinguished from any ancestors with the same name by their position in the order of succession; for example Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, is thus distinguished from his father, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

=== Other European countries ===
In French, the designations for a father and son with the same name are (father) and (son), an example being Alexandre Dumas and Alexandre Dumas. (the young) may be used to distinguish between brothers.

In Portuguese, common designations are (junior), (son), (grandson), (great-grandson), and (nephew).

In Dutch, &quot;sr.&quot; and &quot;jr.&quot; are used socially rather than legally, but the system is not extended to &quot;III&quot; and beyond. Instead, Piet de Vries jr. will become Piet de Vries sr. upon the death of his father if there is a grandson also named Piet to take on the junior title. Otherwise the suffix falls away.

In Swedish, (the elder) and (the younger), abbreviated and respectively, are sometimes used to distinguish two people with the same name, often but not necessarily, father and son. An example is Gösta Ekman d.ä., actor and grandfather of actor Gösta Ekman d.y., cf. Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger which in Swedish are &quot;Plinius den äldre&quot; and &quot;Plinius den yngre&quot;.

In Irish, (young), sometimes anglicised as &quot;oge&quot;, may be used to distinguish two related people who might otherwise have the same name. The suffix is used to mean &#x27;of or relating to&#x27; a noun or an adjective e.g. or .
