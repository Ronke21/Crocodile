<text>Amoxapine, sold under the brand name Asendin among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is the N-demethylated metabolite of loxapine. Amoxapine first received marketing approval in the United States in 1980, approximately 10 to 20 years after most of the other TCAs were introduced in the United States.

==Medical uses==
Amoxapine is used in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Compared to other antidepressants it is believed to have a faster onset of action, with therapeutic effects seen within four to seven days. In excess of 80% of patients that do respond to amoxapine are reported to respond within two weeks of the beginning of treatment. It also has properties similar to those of the atypical antipsychotics, and may behave as one and thus may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia off-label. Despite its apparent lack of extrapyramidal side effects in patients with schizophrenia it has been found to worsen motor function in a study of three patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and psychosis.

==Contraindications==
As with all FDA-approved antidepressants it carries a black-box warning about the potential of an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children, adolescents and young adults under the age of 25. Its use is also advised against in individuals with known hypersensitivities to either amoxapine or other ingredients in its oral formulations. Its use is also recommended against in the following disease states:

* Severe cardiovascular disorders (potential of cardiotoxic adverse effects such as QT interval prolongation)
* Uncorrected narrow angle glaucoma
* Acute recovery post-myocardial infarction

Its use is also advised against in individuals concurrently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors or if they have been on one in the past 14 days and in individuals on drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (e.g. ondansetron, citalopram, pimozide, sertindole, ziprasidone, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, etc.).

===Lactation===
Its use in breastfeeding mothers not recommended as it is excreted in breast milk and the concentration found in breast milk is approximately a quarter that of the maternal serum level.

==Side effects==
Adverse effects by incidence:
&quot;Note: Serious (that is, those that can either result in permanent injury or are irreversible or are potentially life-threatening) are written in bold text.&quot;

Very common (&gt;10% incidence) adverse effects include:

* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Sedation

Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Anxiety
* Ataxia
* Blurred vision
* Confusion
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Nervousness/restlessness
* Excessive appetite
* Rash
* Increased perspiration (sweating)
* Tremor
* Palpitations
* Nightmares
* Excitement
* Weakness
* ECG changes

* Oedema. An abnormal accumulation of fluids in the tissues of the body leading to swelling. 
* Prolactin levels increased. Prolactin is a hormone that regulates the generation of breast milk. Prolactin elevation is not as significant as with risperidone or haloperidol.

Uncommon/Rare (&lt;1% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Diarrhoea
* Flatulence
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Tachycardia (high heart rate)
* Menstrual irregularity
* Disturbance of accommodation
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a drop in blood pressure that occurs upon standing up)
* Seizure
* Urinary retention (being unable to pass urine)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vomiting 
* Nasal congestion
* Photosensitization
* Hypomania (a dangerously elated/irritable mood)
* Tingling
* Paresthesias of the extremities
* Tinnitus
* Disorientation
* Numbness
* Incoordination
* Disturbed concentration
* Epigastric distress
* Peculiar taste in the mouth
* Increased or decreased libido
* Impotence (difficulty achieving an erection)
* Painful ejaculation
* Lacrimation (crying without an emotional cause)
* Weight gain
* Altered liver function
* Breast enlargement
* Drug fever
* Pruritus (itchiness)
* Vasculitis a disorder where blood vessels are destroyed by inflammation. Can be life-threatening if it affects the right blood vessels.
* Galactorrhoea (lactation that is not associated with pregnancy or breast feeding)
* Delayed micturition (that is, delays in urination from when a conscious effort to urinate is made)
* Hyperthermia (elevation of body temperature; its seriousness depends on the extent of the hyperthermia)
* Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) this is basically when the body&#x27;s level of the hormone, antidiuretic hormone, which regulates the conservation of water and the restriction of blood vessels, is elevated. This is potentially fatal as it can cause electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia (low blood sodium), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) and hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium) which can be life-threatening. 
* Agranulocytosis a drop in white blood cell counts. The white blood cells are the cells of the immune system that fight off foreign invaders. Hence agranulocytosis leaves an individual open to life-threatening infections.
* Leukopaenia the same as agranulocytosis but less severe. 
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a potentially fatal reaction to antidopaminergic agents, most often antipsychotics. It is characterised by hyperthermia, diarrhoea, tachycardia, mental status changes [e.g. confusion], rigidity, extrapyramidal side effects)
* Tardive dyskinesia a most often irreversible neurologic reaction to antidopaminergic treatment, characterised by involuntary movements of facial muscles, tongue, lips, and other muscles. It develops most often only after prolonged (months, years or even decades) exposure to antidopaminergics. 
* Extrapyramidal side effects. Motor symptoms such as tremor, parkinsonism, involuntary movements, reduced ability to move one&#x27;s voluntary muscles, etc.

Unknown incidence or relationship to drug treatment adverse effects include:
* Paralytic ileus (paralysed bowel)
* Atrial arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Stroke
* Heart block
* Hallucinations
* Purpura
* Petechiae
* Parotid swelling
* Changes in blood glucose levels
* Pancreatitis swelling of the pancreas
* Hepatitis swelling of the liver
* Urinary frequency
* Testicular swelling
* Anorexia (weight loss)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Thrombocytopenia a significant drop in platelet count that leaves one open to life-threatening bleeds. 
* Eosinophilia an elevated level of the eosinophils of the body. Eosinophils are the type of immune cell that&#x27;s job is to fight off parasitic invaders. 
* Jaundice yellowing of the skin, eyes and mucous membranes due to an impaired ability of the body to clear the by product of haem breakdown, bilirubin, most often the result of liver damage as it is the liver&#x27;s responsibility to clear bilirubin.

It tends to produce less anticholinergic effects, sedation and weight gain than some of the earlier TCAs (e.g. amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, trimipramine). It may also be less cardiotoxic than its predecessors.

==Overdose==
It is considered particularly toxic in overdose, with a high rate of renal failure (which usually takes 2–5 days), rhabdomyolysis, coma, seizures and even status epilepticus. Some believe it to be less cardiotoxic than other TCAs in overdose, although reports of cardiotoxic overdoses have been made.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Amoxapine possesses a wide array of pharmacological effects. It is a moderate and strong reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, respectively, and binds to the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D2, α1-adrenergic, D3, D4, and H1 receptors with varying but significant affinity, where it acts as an antagonist (or inverse agonist depending on the receptor in question) at all sites. It has weak but negligible affinity for the dopamine transporter and the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, D1, α2-adrenergic, H4, mACh, and GABAA receptors, and no affinity for the β-adrenergic receptors or the allosteric benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor. Amoxapine is also a weak GlyT2 blocker, as well as a weak (Ki = 2.5 μM, EC50 = 0.98 μM) δ-opioid receptor partial agonist.

7-Hydroxyamoxapine, a major active metabolite of amoxapine, is a more potent dopamine receptor antagonist and contributes to its neuroleptic efficacy, whereas 8-Hydroxyamoxapine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but a stronger serotonin reuptake inhibitor and helps to balance amoxapine&#x27;s ratio of serotonin to norepinephrine transporter blockade.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Amoxapine is metabolised into two main active metabolites: 7-hydroxyamoxapine and 8-hydroxyamoxapine.

Where:

*t1/2 is the elimination half life of the compound.
*tmax is the time to peak plasma levels after oral administration of amoxapine.
*CSS is the steady state plasma concentration.
*protein binding is the extent of plasma protein binding.
*Vd is the volume of distribution of the compound.

<text>John Wrottesley, 2nd Baron Wrottesley (5 August 1798 – 27 October 1867) was an English astronomer.
==Life==
Wrottesley was the son of John Wrottesley, 1st Baron Wrottesley, and his first wife Lady Caroline Bennet, daughter of Charles Bennet, 4th Earl of Tankerville. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a First Class degree in Mathematics in 1819. He succeeded his father as baron on 16 March 1841.

Wrottesley is distinguished for his attainments in astronomical science, was a founding member of the Royal Astronomical Society and served as its president from 1841 to 1842. In 1839 he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for his &quot;Catalogue of the Right Ascensions of 1,318 Stars&quot;. In 1853 he called the attention of the House of Lords to Lieutenant Maury&#x27;s valuable scheme of meteorological observations and discoveries, and on 30 November 1855 succeeded the Earl of Rosse as President of the Royal Society. Wrottesley was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1860, the year of the famous debate between Wilberforce and Huxley at the Association&#x27;s Oxford meeting.

The crater Wrottesley on the Moon is named in honour of John Wrottesley.

Lord Wrottesley died in October 1867, aged 69.

<text>Sir George Halsey Perley (September 12, 1857 – January 4, 1938) was an American-born Canadian politician and diplomat.

==Early life==

Born in Lebanon, New Hampshire, the son of William Goodhue Perley and Mabel E. Ticknor Stevens, Perley was educated at the Ottawa Grammar School, at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire, and at Harvard University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1878. Perley became a partner in the Perley &amp; Pattee, a lumber company in which his father was senior partner. After Perley &amp; Pattee dissolved in 1893, Perley became head of G.H. Perley &amp; Co which had mills at Pointe-Calumet, Quebec and vice president of the Hull Lumber Company, Ltd., which is operating largely on the upper Ottawa. For many years, Perley was vice president of the Canada Atlantic Railway Co., president of the Rideau Club and president of the Ottawa Golf Club. Along with the other heirs of his father, he donated his homestead on Wellington Street for the purpose of establishing a hospital and served as vice president of its Board of Management. In 1900, he was chairman of the Ottawa and Hull Fire Relief Fund, and distributed about $1,000,000 among the sufferers by the 1900 Hull–Ottawa fire.

Perley married Annie Hespeler Bowlby in Kitchener, Ontario on 4 June 1884. Perley had two children: Mabel, born 8 July 1885 and died 13 March 1887, and Ethel Lesa, born 16 September 1888.

==Politics==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative MP for Argenteuil in 1904, having failed to defeat Mr. W. C. Edwards for the seat in Russell County during the election of 1900. Perley served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Minister of the Overseas Military Forces in the World War I government of Sir Robert Borden. He did not run for re-election in the 1917 federal election in order to concentrate on his duties in London. He returned to the House of Commons in the 1925 federal election and subsequently served as Secretary of State for Canada in the short-lived 1926 government of Arthur Meighen and then as Minister without Portfolio in the government of R. B. Bennett following the 1930 federal election. He was re-elected in the 1935 federal election which also saw the defeat of Bennett&#x27;s government, and remained an MP until his death in 1938.

<text>The Fulton FA-2 Airphibian is an American roadable aircraft manufactured in 1946.

==Development==

Designed by Robert Edison Fulton Jr., it was an aluminum-bodied car, built with independent suspension, aircraft-sized wheels, and a six-cylinder 165 hp engine. The fabric wings were easily attached to the fuselage, converting the car into a plane. Four prototypes were built.

In December 1950, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) (later to become the FAA) certified one of the prototypes and gave it an 1A11 Aircraft Specification, N74104. Lou Achitoff, was the CAA test pilot. The N74154 is the aircraft that is today in the main building of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, having previously been on display in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

The craft made its debut in November 1946 at Danbury, Connecticut. Financial concerns forced Fulton to sell to a company that never developed it.

==Design==
The Airphibian took the approach of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook on the side of the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging lock levers connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.

==Survivors==
In the mid-1990s, one of the surviving Airphibians was restored by Fulton III, along with David Dumas and Deborah Hanson. Later, it was put on display for several years at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in their main display hall, but in 2009 it moved to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center (annex of the National Air and Space Museum). Since 2022 it has been on display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

<text>The Airway was an American microcar with two seats, made by Everett Miller and T. P. Hall, and Clarence O Lee was a loaned engineer between 1949 and 1950 in San Diego, California. It had an all-aluminum body and chassis and an air-cooled 10 hp (7 kW) Onan engine mounted at the back. Normally it would only use a single fluid-drive speed, plus an emergency low gear.

== History ==

Hall had attempted several times to make a flying car, but stuck with a more conventional design for this car. The streamlined styling was considered to be modern and quite appealing, and its tiny wheels made the car look larger than it actually was. It used a large amount of aluminum and plastic to reduce its weight. Its wheelbase was in length ( all told) and wide. Only two are known to have been made, one of the coupe and one of the sedan, though a number of photographs exist.

<text>is a Japanese voice actor and singer. He is represented by the voice actor management firm, Aoni Production, and was previously represented by Arts Vision and 81 Produce. In 1988, he voiced the character Tetsuo Shima in the movie &quot;Akira&quot;, which was adapted from the manga of the same name. He also provided the voice of Yusuke Urameshi in the anime adaptation of the manga &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and returned to that role in video games for that franchise. He is sometimes mistaken for fellow voice actress Nozomi Sasaki, whose name is written the same way. Sasaki has emerged the victor of the Seiyū Grand Prix (in which votes were collected to compile a top ten list of voice actors) more times than any other voice actor.

Sasaki was known for having a high-pitched voice, but by 1998 it became lower due to constantly overworking in voice acting and singing, although it was suspected at first that the reason his voice changed was due to his constant smoking and drinking. He&#x27;s an avid reader and can speak English.

<text>Shanti Snyder (born 4 June 1981), better known as Shanti (stylized in all-caps), is a Japanese lyricist, singer, songwriter, and music TV host of mixed descent, based in Japan and hailing from Kanagawa Prefecture. She performs with a few different formations at clubs in the Tokyo area and has also appeared with various other musical artists. Shanti&#x27;s voice is well known through her collaborations with Yoko Kanno, notably in &quot;Escaflowne the Movie&quot;, where she was the vocalist on the theme song &quot;Sora&quot;.

==Biography==
Shanti was born to American musician Tommy Snyder, who has been the drummer and vocalist for Godiego since 1977. Shanti is a frequent lyricist and vocalist for commercials, working with many Tokyo based commercial song production companies and advertising agencies, recording songs and narrations for businesses such as Coca-Cola, Tokyo Disney Resort, and Xerox. Shanti Snyder wrote four songs on J-pop singer Crystal Kay&#x27;s debut album, &quot;C.L.L Crystal Lover Light&quot;.

In 2008, the song called &quot;Home&quot; that Shanti co-wrote with Hajime Yoshizawa featured her voice. It received attention in Japan when it was used for a caffe latte advertising campaign featuring Scarlett Johansson. In June 2008, when the song was pre-released on iTunes to promote Hajime Yoshizawa&#x27;s &quot;Japan&quot; album, it was number 1 on iTunes for a short time.

Shanti&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Share My Air&quot;, was recorded in Paris with some of France&#x27;s top musicians. The album was released in Japan on the Hayama label.

From October 2008 until March 2010, Shanti was the co-host for &quot;J-Melo&quot;, an NHK World music program that was broadcast worldwide.

Shanti sang the ending theme song, &quot;Pray for the World&quot;, for the film &quot;Reunion&quot; released in Japan in February 2013.&quot;

<doc id="851511" wikidata="Q412232" url="?curid=851511" title="Ajax (Nash Motors)">
<text>The Ajax was an American automobile brand manufactured by the Nash Motors Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1925 and 1926. The Ajax was produced in the newly acquired Mitchell Motors Company plant in Racine, Wisconsin. In 1926, all Ajax models were converted into Nash Light Sixes.

== Origin ==
Demand for Nash automobiles was so high that by November 1924, the company&#x27;s existing plants were operating around the clock six days a week, and Charles W. Nash announced a US$1 million expansion at the automaker&#x27;s original Kenosha facility.

Mitchell Motors Company was the manufacturer of Mitchell brand automobiles from 1903 through 1923. In April 1923 the company was forced into bankruptcy. At the 31 January 1924 auction of the Mitchell land and buildings with of floor space, Charles Nash offered the winning bid of $405,000.

The Ajax was built using machinery moved from Nash&#x27;s other acquisition, the LaFayette Motors Company of Milwaukee, and installed in the Racine plant. Thus, new Ajax was based on an earlier design, premium version of the Lafayette from the early 1920s. The Ajax was available in three body styles: a 4-door sedan, a 4-door touring, and a 2-door sedan. The advertised retail price was $865 for the five-passenger touring car and $995 for the five-passenger four-door sedan.

The Ajax came standard with a L-head Nash straight-six engine with a seven main bearing crankshaft, force-feed lubrication system, three-speed transmission, four-wheel brakes (at that time unusual for a car of its price), steel disc wheels, as well as mohair velvet upholstery and an electric clock. The Ajax Six produced &quot;genuine 60 mph&quot; (97 km/h) driving.

==Badge engineering==
The manufacture of the Ajax was identical, but customers were not believing that &quot;the value-oriented Ajax brand&quot; was a Nash car. Despite receiving good reviews from the automotive press and the general public, the Ajax brand was discontinued in 1926 after over 22,000 models were sold. Charles Nash ordered that the production continue instead as the Nash Light Six.

The Nash was a known and respected automobile brand that was also the name of the company&#x27;s founder. Production was stopped for two days while Nash hubcaps, emblems, and radiator shells were trucked to Racine where all unshipped Ajax brand cars were converted into Nash badged automobiles. Likewise, changeover kits were sent to dealers to retrofit all unsold cars by removing the Ajax badges such as those found on the hubcaps. However, some cars included &quot;Ajax Six, Nash-built&quot; on the Moto-Meter label and an Ajax Motors logo on the serial number tag.

One of the first cases of &quot;badge engineering&quot; began in 1917 with Texan automobiles assembled in Fort Worth, Texas, that made use of Elcar bodies made in Elkhart, Indiana. However, the transformation of the Ajax was &quot;probably the industry&#x27;s first example of one car becoming another.&quot;. Nash even made the kits available at no charge to consumers who bought Ajax cars, but did not want to own an orphaned make automobile, to protect the investment they had made in a Nash Motors product. Because of this, few unmodified original Ajax cars have survived. 

Sales of the rechristened Nash Light Six improved with the more known moniker. The 1926 four-door sedan was now advertised for $1,525. The combined Ajax and Nash Light accounted for more than 24% of the automaker&#x27;s total production in 1926.

<doc id="851512" wikidata="Q6600901" url="?curid=851512" title="List of U.S. cities with significant Chinese-American populations">
<text>Cities considered to have significant Chinese-American populations are large U.S. cities or municipalities with a critical mass of at least 1% of the total urban population; medium-sized cities with a critical mass of at least 1% of their total population; and small cities with a critical mass of at least 10% of the total population.

According to the 2012 Census estimates, the three metropolitan areas with the largest Chinese-American populations were the Greater New York Combined Statistical Area at 735,019 people, the San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland Combined Statistical Area at 629,243 people, and the Greater Los Angeles Combined Statistical Area at about 566,968 people. In the post-1965 era, first- and second-generation immigrants include those from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Also included in the Chinese-American population enumeration are ethnic Chinese from Malaysia and Vietnam who might identify themselves as Chinese, thus skewing the census reporting.

New York City is home to by far the highest Chinese-American population of any city proper, with an estimated 573,388 Chinese-Americans in New York City, significantly higher than the total of the next five cities combined; multiple large Chinatowns in Manhattan, Brooklyn (three), and Queens (three) are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves, as large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York, with the largest metropolitan Chinese population outside Asia. The Los Angeles County city of Monterey Park has the highest percentage of Chinese-Americans of any municipality, at 43.7% of its population, or 24,758 people. The San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County is the single largest concentration of combined Chinese and Taiwanese Americans in the country, having a collections of U.S. suburbs with large foreign-born Chinese-speaking populations, ranging from working-class individuals residing in Rosemead and El Monte to wealthier immigrants living in Arcadia, San Marino, and Diamond Bar. A similar demographic shift has also taken place in the southern half of the San Francisco Bay Area. Conversely, the suburbs of New York City within the state of New Jersey are notable for their widespread and increasing prevalence of Chinese-Americans (see list below), reflecting their general affluence and propensity for professional occupation.

==Metropolitan areas with more than 20,000 Chinese-Americans==
The list of metropolitan areas with a Chinese-American population of 20,000 or more .
==Large-sized cities==
The list of large cities (population greater than 250,000) with a Chinese-American population of at least 1% of the total population, .
===New York City boroughs===
As the city proper with the nation&#x27;s largest Chinese-American population by a wide margin, with an estimated 562,205 in 2016 by the 2010-2016 American Community Survey, and as the primary destination for new Chinese immigrants, New York City is subdivided into official municipal boroughs, which themselves are home to significant Chinese populations, with Brooklyn and Queens, adjacently located on Long Island, leading the fastest growth. After the City of New York itself, the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn encompass the largest Chinese populations, respectively, of all municipalities in the United States.
==Medium-sized cities==
List of medium-sized cities (population between 100,000 and 250,000) with a Chinese-American population of at least one percent of the total population, according to the American Community Survey.



==Small-sized cities==
The following is a list of places in the United States with a population fewer than 100,000 in which at least three percent (five percent in Los Angeles or San Francisco Bay areas) of the total population is Chinese, according to the 2010-2015 American Community Survey, and the 2010 U.S. Census for the U.S. territories.

===American Samoa===

===California===

;Greater Los Angeles Area

The majority of the Chinese-American population of more than 400,000 in Los Angeles County lives within the San Gabriel Valley, which is particularly noted for cities that have a large Chinese-American ethnic plurality. The following cities have the highest percentage of Chinese-Americans in Greater Los Angeles.


;San Francisco Bay Area
Traditionally centered in San Francisco and Chinatown Oakland, the suburbanization of the Bay Area&#x27;s Chinese-American population has resulted in significant concentrations in the southwestern East Bay, eastern Peninsula, and northern Santa Clara County. Chinese enclaves have also formed in many of these cities, in a similar manner to that of Southern California&#x27;s San Gabriel Valley.

===Delaware===

===Georgia===

===Guam===

===Hawaii===
===Indiana===

===New Jersey===
===Northern Mariana Islands===

Within Saipan, villages with significant Chinese populations include Garapan (19.7% Chinese), Chalan Piao (18.1% Chinese), Chalan Kanoa IV (15.1% Chinese), and San Antonio (19.8% Chinese).

===Ohio===


===Texas===

===Washington===
The overwhelming majority of these cities are in King County, while three others (Edmonds, Lynnwood, and Mill Creek) are in Snohomish County. Pullman is in Whitman County.

<doc id="851516" wikidata="Q3554375" url="?curid=851516" title="Van's Aircraft">
<text>Van&#x27;s Aircraft, Inc. is an American kit aircraft manufacturer founded by Richard VanGrunsven in 1973. The Van&#x27;s RV series aircraft are all-aluminum, low-wing monoplanes of monocoque construction. In 2023, over 11,000 Van&#x27;s aircraft were flying worldwide, one third of the USA&#x27;s experimental aircraft fleet.

The Van&#x27;s Aircraft factory is located at Aurora State Airport, Oregon. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2023.

==History==
The company was founded by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; VanGrunsven in 1973.

In 2013, the company announced it would begin selling assembled RV-12 model aircraft as well on a limited basis.

In December 2017, the company reported that its 10,000th aircraft had flown, an RV-7 built in Martinsburg, West Virginia.

As of November 2019, about 10,600 RV kits had been completed and flown, and thousands more are under construction. Completion rates currently average about 1.5 per day, making the series the most numerous of all homebuilt aircraft.

After announcing financial difficulties in October 2023, on December 4 2023 Van&#x27;s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Factors leading to the reorganization included corrosion issues (a &quot;multi million&quot; dollar problem), laser-cutting instead of punched parts (affecting 1800 kits), and kit pricing under the cost of production and shipping.

==Regulatory status==

RVs are deemed &quot;Experimental Amateur Built (EAB) aircraft&quot; by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and are accepted under the corresponding category by the aviation authorities in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. A modified version of the RV-6 was sold to the Nigerian government as a kit-assembled military trainer.

The RV-12iS is available as an experimental light sport aircraft (ELSA) or special light-sport aircraft (SLSA), which allows for commercial use for purposes like rental and flight training.

==RV aircraft series==

*RV-3: single-seat kit aircraft, aerobatic, debuted in 1972; genesis design for rest of the RV series 
*RV-4: two-seat kit aircraft, tandem seating, aerobatic, bubble canopy
*RV-6: two-seat, side-by-side seating aircraft, aerobatic; the most-built model of the RV series and likely the most popular kitplane ever produced&lt;ref name=&quot;RV-6/6A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*RV-7: modernized kit with similarity to the RV-6, with longer wingspan and larger rudder, aerobatic; replaced the RV-6 model&lt;ref name=&quot;RV-7/7A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*RV-8: two-seat tandem seating, aerobatic aircraft, with larger cockpit and greater overall size than the RV-4&lt;ref name=&quot;RV-8/8A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*RV-9: two seat, side-by-side aircraft; non-aerobatic, with larger wing and more docile handling qualities than others in the RV line&lt;ref name=&quot;RV-9/9A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*RV-10: largest of the RV fleet with four seats, non-aerobatic, tricycle landing gear only
*RV-12: two-seat, side-by-side light-sport aircraft, updated to RV-12iS variant in 2017 
*RV-14: two-seat, side-by-side aerobatic aircraft, considered similar to the RV-7 in design but larger and roomier&lt;ref name=&quot;RV-14/14A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*RV-15: future high-wing, back-country capable aircraft

Four of the designations missing from this sequence — RV-1, RV-2, RV-5, and RV-11 — apply to projects by Richard VanGrunsven that were never produced or marketed by Van&#x27;s Aircraft (or even completed in the case of the RV-2 and RV-11). The RV-13 designation was not used at all.

<text>Soyuz TM-22 was a Soyuz spaceflight to the Soviet space station Mir. It launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome Launch Pad 1 on September 3, 1995. After two days of free flight, the crew docked with Mir to become Mir Principal Expedition 20 and Euromir 95. Mir 20 was a harbinger of the multinational missions that would be typical of the International Space Station. After 179 days, 1 hour and 42 minutes on orbit, Reiter obtained the record for spaceflight duration by a Western European.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==
Soyuz TM-22 was a Russian transport spacecraft that transported cosmonauts to the Mir space station for a 179-day stay. It was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome and docked on September 5, 1995, with Mir&#x27;s Kvant-2 module at the port that was vacated by Progress M-28 a day before.

Soyuz TM-22 was the final mission launched on the Soyuz-U2 launch vehicle, fueled by synthetic Syntin rather than the RP-1 fuel used in other variants of the Soyuz launch vehicle.

The crew&#x27;s commander was Yuri Pavlovich Gidzenko of the Russian Air Force. The flight engineer was Sergey Vasilyevich Avdeyev of RKK Energiya. Thomas Reiter was the first ESA cosmonaut on a long duration Mir crew as part of the European Mission &quot;Euromir 95&quot;.

While docked with Mir, the Soyuz was joined by Progress M-29, Space Shuttle Atlantis as part of STS-74 and Progress M-30.

The spaceflight took two months longer than planned due to lack of funds for Soyuz TM-23.

== Mir principal expedition 20 and Euromir 95 ==
Mir 20 was the second Mir mission with the Euromir designation and an ESA cosmonaut as part of the crew. The first was Ulf Merbold with Euromir94. The objectives of Euromir95 was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body, develop materials for the space environment, to capture particles of cosmic and anthropogenic dust in low Earth orbit and to test new space equipment. Mir 20 was the second mission to include a NASA Space Shuttle docking. During that phase of the mission, Mir housed crews from four countries: Russia, Canada, Germany and the United States.

=== September 5–11, 1995 ===

==== Soyuz-TM 22 Docks ====

After two days of autonomous orbital flight, on September 5, the spacecraft docked with Mir after circling from 90-120m out at the -X docking port. After an hour and a half, the crew checked the hatch seals, removed their space suits and entered the station and were welcomed by Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin of Mir Principle Expedition 19 with the traditional bread and salt. The crews then began a week of joint work that included a handover from the Mir 19 crew to familiarize Mir 20 with the status of the onboard systems and experiments.

=== September 11 - October 10, 1995 ===

==== Mir 19 Ends ====
Solovyev and Budarin ended their 75-day mission by departing on the Soyuz-TM 21 on September 11. Their Soyuz landed safely in Kazakhstan, 302 km northeast of Arkalyk, far away from the aiming point, however the rescue crews found Mir 19 in excellent condition.

==== Euromir Science Activities Begin ====
The Mir 20 crew began activating and calibrating the Euromir 95 experiments on September 13. The 41 experiments included 18 life sciences, 5 astrophysics, 8 material science and 10 technology experiments. An average of four and a half hours per day was allotted for experimental work, the rest of the time was devoted to exercise and station maintenance. Thomas Reiter, in addition to his Euromir duties, participated in Russian experiments and in his role as flight engineer, he helped maintain the station&#x27;s onboard equipment.

=== October 10 - November 15, 1995 ===

==== Progress-M 29 arrives ====

Progress-M 29 was launched from the Baiknour Cosmodrome on October 8, 1995, at 18:51 UTC on a Soyuz-U rocket. The resupply ship docked with Mir on October 10, 1995, at 20:23 UTC with about 2.5 tons of fresh supplies and equipment for the Mir 20 crew including 80 kg of experimental hardware for Euromir 95.

==== Mir 20/Euromir 95 extended ====
On October 6, 1995, the decision was made to extend the Mir 20 mission by 44 days at a meeting of the RSA, ESA, RSC Energia, the Russian Central Specialized Design Bureau (Soyuz rocket designer) and representatives of the Progress Plant where the Soyuz-U rocket for the launch of Mir 21 was under construction. By postponing the Soyuz TM-23 launch from January 15, 1996, to February 21, 1996, they were able to shift much of the expenditure for the vehicle processing to the next fiscal year, relieving strain on the RSA budget. This also allowed full usage of the Soyuz-TM 22 module&#x27;s 180-day lifetime, allow time for more Euromir research and an extra EVA.

==== First Mir 20/Euromir 95 EVA ====
Thomas Reiter became the first ESA cosmonaut to perform an EVA when he climbed through the Kvant 2 hatch on October 20 with Sergei Avdeyev. In a successful 5 hour and 11 minute EVA, they installed four elements on the ESEF: two exposure cassettes, a spacecraft environmental monitoring package and a control electronics box on the forward section of the Spektr module. One of the cassettes would be opened remotely from within the station to sample the Draconids meteor stream when the Earth passed through the tail of the Giacobini Zinner comet.

==== Coolant loop leak discovered and repaired ====
On November 1, a coolant line to the core module air regeneration system was found to be leaking. Approximately 1.8L of an ethylene glycol mixture had leaked inside the Mir module. Shutting down the coolant loop required shutting down the primary carbon dioxide removal system in Kvant and the oxygen replenishment system. While they were off, the backup air scrubber using lithium hydroxide canisters similar to those used on the Space Shuttle was used to scrub the carbon dioxide. The leak was found a few days later and repaired with a putty-like substance.

==== Dutch Biokin Air Scrubber tested ====
Two Dutch companies sponsored by the ESA and the Dutch National Institute for Aerospace Programs developed a 500g system to use microbes to filter air by converting airborne contaminants into harmless compounds. The system was activated by the crew on November 9, run for a week and then put in a small freezer for return to Earth on STS-74.

==== Shuttle Docking Module connection ====
The Docking Module was designed and built in 1994 and 1995 in Russia by RSC Energia for the RSA. The 4090 kg, 4.7m long, 2.2m diameter module was delivered to Kennedy Space Center on June 7, 1995, so that the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; could bring it to Mir on STS-74. The module simplified the Space Shuttle orbiter dockings with Mir by eliminating the need to move Kristall to the -X port on Mir each time the Space Shuttle visited. The length also provided more clearance between the orbiter and the Mir solar arrays. The module had identical Androgeynous Peripheral Assembly Systems (APASs) on each end. APAS-1 attached to Kristall, APAS-2 attached to the Shuttle ODS. Visiting crews would then enter the pressurized interior through the APAS-2 hatch and then access Kristall through the APAS-2 hatch.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 12 at 7:30 am EST on the STS-74 mission. For the first two days of the flight, Kenneth Cameron, Atlantis Commander and James Halsell, &quot;Atlantis&quot; Pilot executed a series of reaction control jet firings to gradually bring &quot;Atlantis&quot; closer to Mir. On the third day, Chris Hadfield and William McArthur grappled the Docking Module with the 50-foot mechanical arm, lifting it horizontally out of the bay. When it was clear, he pivoted the module 90 degrees to a vertical position and spun it almost 180 degrees and brought it close to Kristal. Once Hadfield placed the arm in a &#x27;limp&#x27; position (no power, no mechanical parts working), Cameron fired &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s steering thrusters to gently bring the docking systems together, docking the module with Kristal. The next day, the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; used the docking module&#x27;s top hatch to dock with Mir.
=== November 15–18, 1995 ===

==== Second Shuttle-Mir docking ====
On November 15, the fourth day of the STS-74 mission, after a &#x27;go&#x27; from Russian and U.S. ground controllers, Cameron slowed the orbiters approach to less than one inch per second and successfully docked with the station at 6:28 UTC about 216 nautical miles above western Mongolia. After two and a half hours of verification and seal checkouts, Cameron opened the Docking Module hatch and met Mir 20 Commander Gidzenko with a handshake that signaled the formation of a multinational crew.

==== Multinational crew activities ====
The crews transferred cargo items between the visiting Orbiter and Mir over the three days the two were docked. From the Orbiter, Mir received 300 pounds of food, 700 pounds of experimental equipment, 900 pounds of by-product water from &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ fuel cells and 20 lithium hydroxide canisters to serve as backup for Mir&#x27;s primary carbon dioxide removal system. From Mir, the Orbiter received 800 pounds of research samples collected during Euromir 95 and experimental equipment no longer needed by the station.

The crews also spoke with the press and received congratulations from Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Canadian Industry Minister John Manley, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin and U.N. Secretary General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali.

While the Shuttle was docked with Mir, the crews cooperated in medical experiments and environmental investigations designed as part of International Space Station Phase I research. The Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE) was a set of three photogrammetric instruments located in the Orbiter payload bay and recorded Mir solar array dynamics during the docking and docked phase of the mission. The International Space Station Risk Mitigation Experiments evaluated the acoustics of the environment aboard Mir, the alignment stability of the &quot;Atlantis&quot;-Mir docked configuration and the remote communication systems. A series of jet firings by both Mir and &quot;Atlantis&quot; evaluated the dynamics of the complicated structure, which at more than 500,000 pounds, set a new record for a conjoined orbital mass.
==== &quot;Atlantis&quot; undocking ====
&quot;Atlantis&quot; undocked with the station early in the morning of November 18. Once the Orbiter was 525 feet out, he began a fly around, taking a photographic survey of the station. Four and half hours after undocking, Cameron lowered &quot;Atlantis&quot; to another orbit. Two days later, on November 20 at 12:02 EST, the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center in Floriday, ending a 128 orbit mission after 8 days, 4 hours and 31 minutes.

=== November 18 - December 19, 1995 ===

==== Euromir experiments resume ====
After the Space Shuttle departure, the Mir 20/Euromir 95 crew continued with their medical tests and material processing experiments. In addition to equipment brought on board for Euromir, Reiter used the Austrian Optovert equipment that had been on Mir since the Austro-Mir mission in October 1991. He investigated the effects of weightlessness on human motor system performance and the interactions of the vestibular system and visual organs.

==== Gyrodyne maintenance and second Mir 20 EVA ====
The cosmonauts performed preventative maintenance on the Kvant 2 gyrodynes in late November, using the attitude control jets to maintain station orientation while the gyrodynes were inactive.

On December 8, the crew reconfigured the docking port at the front of the Mir base block to prepare it to receive the 1996 Priroda module. They moved the Konus docking unit from the +Z to the -Z docking port where Priroda would attach in the spring.

==== Progress M-29 departs ====
Progress M-29 departed the station on December 19. It undocked from the rear Kvant port and deorbited over the Pacific Ocean.
=== December 20, 1995 - February 22, 1996 ===

==== Progress M-30 resupplies Euromir 95 ====
Progress M-30 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on a Soyuz-U rocket on December 18. It docked with the same port Progress M-29 departed from on December 20 with 2300 kg of fuel, crew supplies, and research/medical equipment for use on the extended Euromir 95 mission.

==== Experiments continue ====
Reiter took biomedical samples and measurements and tested the capacity of uncooled melts in the TITUS materials processing furnace. The Russian cosmonauts studied microgravity effects on hydrodynamics with the Volna-2 device, using models of spacecraft fuel system elements. They also investigated the possible links between terrestrial seismic activity and high-energy charged cosmic particle fluxes with the Maria magnetic spectrometer.

==== Kvant Coolant Loop reactivation and third Mir 20 (second Euromir 95) EVA ====
Between January 12 and 16, the cosmonauts resumed work on the cooling system leak that began in November. They sealed a manifold on the coolant line and then refilled the loop with ethylene glycol that was sent up with Progress M-30. The SPK (or YMK) maneuvering unit was stored inside the Kvant 2 airlock. It was a large unit which hadn&#x27;t been used since it was tested in 1990 and it was in the way of airlock egress so Reiter and Gidzenko moved it outside on a February 8 EVA and attached it outside. They also retrieved the two cassettes they deployed in October. They also attempted to perform a task on the Kristall antenna, but TsUP canceled the antenna work when the cosmonauts were unable to loosen the bolts on the antenna.

==== 10th anniversary of the Mir Base Block ====
The Mir base block launched to orbit on February 20, 1986. On February 20, 1996, ITAR-TASS reported a &#x27;holiday atmosphere&#x27; aboard the complex. Having already remained in orbit for four years longer than originally intended, the station held the promise of at least three more orbiting anniversaries.
=== February 23–29, 1996 ===

==== Progress M-30 undocked and Soyuz TM-23 launched ====
On February 21, Soyuz TM-23 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome with the cosmonauts for Mir Principle Expedition 21. To clear a docking port for the Soyuz TM-23, the Progress M-30 was undocked on February 22 and re-entered over the Pacific Ocean. The Soyuz docked on February 23 at the +X docking port on the rear of the Kvant module. An hour and a half after docking, the hatches opened and Yuri Onufrienko and Yury Usachov were greeted by the Mir 20/Euromir 95 crew. This began a week of joint operations where Mir 20 handed the station over to Mir 21, including familiarization with the current conditions of the projects and the station itself. Two days before the return flight, a water leak appeared in the Mir base block, but the cosmonauts were able to repair it.

==== Mir 20/Euromir 95 mission ends ====
Gidzenko, Avdeyev and Reiter donned their Sokol launch and reentry suits and entered the Soyuz TM-22 on February 29, 1996. They landed safely about 105 km from Arkalyk. Their mission lasted 179 days, 1 hour and 42 minutes. Reiter then held the record for spaceflight duration by a Western European.

<text>Georges Delerue (12 March 1925 – 20 March 1992) was a French composer who composed over 350 scores for cinema and television. Delerue won numerous important film music awards, including an Academy Award for &quot;A Little Romance&quot; (1980), three César Awards (1979, 1980, 1981), two ASCAP Awards (1988, 1990), and one Gemini Award for &quot;Sword of Gideon&quot; (1987). He was also nominated for four additional Academy Awards for &quot;Anne of the Thousand Days&quot; (1969), &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973), &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), and &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), four additional César Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and one Genie Award for &quot;Black Robe&quot; (1991).

The French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; named him &quot;the Mozart of cinema.&quot; Delerue was the first composer to win three consecutive César Awards for &quot;Get Out Your Handkerchiefs&quot; (1979), &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Last Metro&quot; (1981). Georges Delerue was named Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France&#x27;s highest honours.

==Early life and education==
Delerue was born 12 March 1925 in Roubaix, France, to Georges Delerue and Marie Lhoest. He was raised in a musical household; his grandfather led an amateur chorale group and his mother sang and played piano at family gatherings. By the age of fourteen he was playing clarinet at the local music conservatory. In 1940 he was forced to abandon his studies at the Turgot Institute in order to work at a factory to help support his family. He continued playing clarinet with local bands, eventually transitioning to piano under the instruction of Madame Picavet-Bacquart. He studied Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, and Grieg, and was particularly inspired by Richard Strauss. Following a long convalescence after being diagnosed with scoliosis, Georges decided to become a composer.

In 1945, following his studies at the Roubaix conservatory, Delerue was accepted into the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied fugue with Simone Plé-Caussade and composition with Henri Büsser. To help support himself, he took jobs playing at dances, baptisms, marriages, and funerals—even performing jazz in the piano bars near the Paris Opera. 

In 1947 he received an honorable mention for the Rome Prize, and the following year he won the Second Grand Rome Prize. That year at the Theater Festival of Avignon, Delerue conducted a performance of &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. In the 1949 Rome Prize competition, he won the First Second Grand Prize, and the First Prize for Composition. He began writing stage music during the late 1940s, including for the Théâtre National Populaire, Comédie-Française and the company of Jean-Louis Barrault. He also became friends with Maurice Jarre and Pierre Boulez.

==Career==
By the early 1950s Delerue was composing music for short films and writing theatrical music for the Théâtre Babylone and the Opéra Comique. He began collaborating with Boris Vian on a number of projects during this time, including theatrical adaptations of &quot;The Snow Knight&quot; and &quot;The Builders of Empire&quot;, an oratorio &quot;A Regrettable Incident&quot;, and a ballet &quot;The Barker&quot;. In 1952 he began directing the orchestra of the Club d&#x27;Essai for French National Radio and Television, and scored his first television drama &quot;Princes du sang&quot;. In 1954 he wrote his first compositions for historical spectacles of light and sound, &quot;Lisieux&quot; and &quot;The Liberation of Paris&quot;. In 1955 he composed his &quot;Concert Symphony for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, and on 31 January 1957 his opera &quot;The Snow Knight&quot; premiered at Nancy and was a popular success. In 1959 he composed his first score for a feature film, &quot;Le bel âge&quot;.

His career was diverse and he composed frequently for major art house directors, most often François Truffaut (including &quot;Jules and Jim&quot;), but also for Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Contempt&quot; (&quot;Le Mépris&quot;), and for Alain Resnais, Louis Malle, and Bernardo Bertolucci, besides later working on several Hollywood productions, including Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Salvador&quot;. Another director Delerue composed for was Ken Russell, who in return filmed a BBC documentary about Delerue entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot the Composer&quot; (1966).

He composed the music for Flemming Flindt&#x27;s ballet, &quot;Enetime&quot; (&quot;The Lesson&quot;), based on Ionesco&#x27;s play, &quot;The Lesson&quot;. During his 42-year career, he composed scores for 200 feature movies, 125 short ones, 70 TV films, and 35 TV serials. The soundtrack for war docudrama by Pierre Schoendoerffer, &quot;Diên Biên Phu&quot; (1992), was one of his late notable works.

Delerue also made cameo appearances in &quot;La nuit americaine&quot; and &quot;Les deux anglaises et le continent&quot;.

==Collaborations with Jack Clayton==
Delerue composed the music for five of the films made by the noted British director Jack Clayton. Their first collaboration was &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964), followed by &quot;Our Mother&#x27;s House&quot; (1967). In 1982 they reunited for the Disney film version of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, but the production was fraught with problems. Unhappy with the sinister tone of Clayton&#x27;s original cut, the studio took control of the film, and held it back from release for over a year. They reportedly spent an additional $5 million on re-editing the film, cutting some scenes and replacing them with newly shot footage, with the aim of making the film more commercial and &#x27;family-friendly&#x27;. To Delerue&#x27;s great disappointment, Disney also insisted on the removal of his original music (which was considered &#x27;too dark&#x27;), and replaced it with a new, &#x27;lighter&#x27; score by American composer James Horner. Speaking later about the rejection of his score, Delerue said: &quot;It was extremely painful ... because it was probably the most ambitious score I wrote in the United States.&quot; Delerue&#x27;s music for the film was only available to collectors in low-quality bootleg copies until 2011, when Disney authorised the release of approximately 30 minutes of music, sourced from Delerue&#x27;s personal tape copy of the score (which originally ran for over an hour). This was issued by Universal France (along with Delerue&#x27;s music for the 1991 film &quot;Regarding Henry&quot;) in a limited edition of 3000 CDs, as the inaugural release of its &quot;Ecoutez le Cinema!&quot; soundtrack series. Despite this disappointment, Delerue worked with Clayton twice more, on his last feature film, &quot;The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne&quot; (1987), and on Clayton&#x27;s final screen project, a feature length BBC TV adaptation of Muriel Spark&#x27;s &quot;Memento Mori&quot; (1992), which aired just a month after Delerue&#x27;s death.

==Death==
Georges Delerue died on 20 March 1992 from a heart attack in Los Angeles, eight days after his 67th birthday, just after recording the last cue for the soundtrack to &quot;Rich in Love&quot;. He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

Delerue married for the last time in 1984; he had a daughter from a previous marriage.

<text>The Ajax was a Swiss automobile built from 1906 to 1910.

Dr. G. Aigner built his first car in Zürich in 1906, but failed. The remains were taken over by a company led by three directors from New York City, Java and Switzerland. A chain-drive monobloc 20/27cv four was introduced early on; the company failed soon after, but regrouped and reformed in 1907. That year the company introduced four new models. These were a 2270 cc 16cv four and a 3267 cc 24cv four, as well as bi-bloc sixes of 3405 cc and 4900 cc. The cars had a mechanical starter, which would begin operating the moment anybody stood on the running board.

In 1907, two Ajax cars competed at the Targa Florio race. One car was crashed, the other failed. The company made an unsuccessful venture into the (taxi) business which forced its closure once again in February 1910, this time for good.

<text>William Nicholson (13 December 175321 May 1815) was an English writer, translator, publisher, scientist, inventor, patent agent and civil engineer. He launched the first monthly scientific journal in Britain, &quot;Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts&quot;, in 1797, and remained its editor until 1814. In 1800, he and Anthony Carlisle were the first to achieve electrolysis, the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen, using a voltaic pile. Nicholson also wrote extensively on natural philosophy and chemistry.

==Early life==
Nicholson was educated in Yorkshire, and after leaving school, he made two voyages as a midshipman in the service of the British East India Company. His first voyage was to India and the second voyage was to China on board the &quot;Gatton,&quot; (1772-1773).

Subsequently, having become acquainted with Josiah Wedgwood in 1775, he moved to Amsterdam, where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood&#x27;s agent.
On his return to England he was persuaded by Thomas Holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals, while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels - &quot;Alwyn&quot; and &quot;Duplicity&quot;. 

Meanwhile, he devoted himself to the preparation of &quot;An Introduction to Natural Philosophy&quot;, which was published in 1782 by Joseph Johnson and was at once successful. Translations for Joseph Johnson included Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Newton&quot; as well as M. Maistre de La Tour&#x27;s &quot;History of Hyder Shah in 1784.&quot; He then published &quot;The Navigator&#x27;s Assistant&quot; based on his time with the East India Company . 

In 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood (the current chairman) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture, established in 1791. 

==Scientific work==
On 12 December 1783, Nicholson was elected to the &quot;Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society&quot;. He was proposed by Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan and seconded by horologist John Whitehurst.

Nicholson communicated to the Royal Society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects. In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over Richard Kirwan&#x27;s essay on phlogiston, and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians (Lavoisier, Monge, Berthollet, and Guyton de Morveau) as &#x27;An Essay on Phlogiston, to which are added Notes.&#x27;
In 1784 he invented the Nicholson hydrometer, a constant volume hydrometer to measure specific gravity of liguids or solids, with a pan for small weights on top and a small container (&quot;basket&quot;) on the bottom into which a sample can be placed.

in 1790, William Nicholson obtained a patent for a cylindrical printing machine - a design which was copied in the US and Barcelona, before Friedrich Koenig developed and commercialised the concept in 1814.

In 1797 he founded, published, and wrote part of the &quot;Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts&quot;, generally known as &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain. The journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs, by George Cayley in 1809–1810. The publication continued until 1814.

Nicholson held a life-long interest in horology, and he became good friends with clockmakers Edward Nairne and J.H. de Magellan. Between April 1797 and August 1799, he wrote four papers of his own on the aspects of timekeeping and throughout his editorship of the Journal (between 1797 and 1813) he published numerous papers by others on the topic. Nicholson had at least two clocks made to his own designs, and his innovations include ‘creating new types of escapement and temperature compensation for pendulum clocks’. One, a skeleton clock, is privately owned. The other is a table regulator with Nicholson’s own form of gravity escapement, dated 1797, in the Ilbert Collection at the British Museum. Described as ‘a unique piece’ with ‘a movement of most unusual and interesting design it has also been called ‘one of the most ingenious’ early pendulum temperature compensators.

In 1799 he established a school in London&#x27;s Soho Square, where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry, with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from Thomas Pitt.

In May 1800 he with Anthony Carlisle discovered electrolysis, the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current. The two were then appointed to a chemical investigation committee of the new Royal Institution. But his own interests shortly turned elsewhere. In 1809 he became a first class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

Besides considerable contributions to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, Nicholson wrote translations of Fourcroy&#x27;s &quot;Chemistry&quot; (1787) and Chaptal&#x27;s &quot;Chemistry&quot; (1788), &quot;First Principles of Chemistry&quot; (1788) and a &quot;Chemical Dictionary&quot; (1795); he also edited the &quot;British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences&quot; (6 vols., London, 1809). A skeptical critique of biblical miracles, &quot;The Doubts of Infidels&quot;, though published anonymously, is attributed to Nicholson.

==Later life==
During the later years of his life, Nicholson&#x27;s attention was chiefly directed to water supply engineering at Portsmouth, at Gosport and in Hammersmith. William Nicholson died in Bloomsbury at the age of 61 on 21 May 1815, attended by Sir Anthony Carlisle.

<text>Midreshet Ben-Gurion (), also known as Midreshet Sde Boker, is a community settlement and an educational center in southern Israel. Located in the Negev next to kibbutz Sde Boker, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat HaNegev Regional Council. In it had a population of .

==History==
The construction of a field school began in 1962, inspired by David Ben-Gurion&#x27;s vision of developing a thriving Jewish culture in the arid Negev. Ben Gurion envisioned the place to be a &quot;Hebrew Oxford of the Negev&quot;.

The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the Ben Gurion Heritage Institute, and a high school (with a boarding school) emphasizing environmental studies, are now located there.

Ben-Gurion and his wife Paula Ben-Gurion are buried nearby in the Ben-Gurion Tomb National Park on a cliff overlooking the Zin valley.

==Solar energy research ==
The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research has developed a solar energy research program focusing on how extremes of heat and cold in the desert can be mitigated through efficient storage of heat during the day for release at night.

An adobe house was built with rational fenestration, small windows in the northern side and heat collecting concrete prisms in the windows of the south facing wall. The prisms are situated in the rooms. They absorb heat during the day and can be rotated to allow the heat to discharge into the rooms at night. The &quot;chimney&quot; is part of an evaporative cooling system that maintains the temperature of the house during the day at bearable levels.

A double skin greenhouse uses copper sulfate solution as a heat screen during the day. The liquid is pumped between the two skins, protects the interior from ultraviolet rays and collects heat. At night the liquid is recirculated returning the heat to the greenhouse.

David Faiman of the Solar Center has made advancements in the realm of concentrator photovoltaics CPV. Faiman has produced a CPV unit capable of producing energy at a factor of up to a thousand more than conventional units.

==Agricultural and biotechnology research==
Researchers at Midreshet Ben-Gurion have made breakthroughs in agriculture and biotechnology relevant to drylands and sustainable agriculture. The STRS1 and STRS2 genes, master controller genes in stress responses, discovered by Dr. Simon Barak and his students in 2006, helped to elucidate some of the more important genes involved with abiotic stress responses.

Avigad Vonshak, Director of the Institutes from 2002 to 2010, made headlines for his discovery, together with Prof. Sammy Boussiba (also of the institutes) of astaxanthin accumulation in green algae. Astaxanthin is an extremely valuable poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) which is valued for its use as a pigment, nutritional value, and possible use in bio-diesel.

<text>The Ajax was a French automobile built by the American Briscoe brothers, Benjamin and Frank, between 1913 and 1919. Originally built in Neuilly, it was a 12 hp cyclecar with 980 cc 4-cylinder engine with friction drive. It sold for £78.

Production continued after the brothers returned to the United States where they built the Argo car, which was similar to the Ajax, differing in the inclusion of a more conventional transmission.

<doc id="851525" wikidata="Q748738" url="?curid=851525" title="Soyuz TM-23">
<text>Soyuz TM-23 was a Soyuz spaceflight which launched on February 21, 1996, to &quot;Mir&quot;. The spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, and after two days of flight, Yuri Onufrienko and Yury Usachov docked with Mir and became the 21st resident crew of the Station. On September 2, 1996, after 191 days docked with Mir, the ship undocked with the launch crew and Claudie André-Deshays onboard, before eventually landing south west of Akmola, Kazakhstan.

==Crew==
== Highlights ==
Onufrienko and Usachev began their mission without a third crew member. American astronaut Shannon Lucid would join them in late March 1996 during STS-76 and depart the Mir 20 mission in September 1996 with STS-79.

== Mir Principal Expedition 21 ==
=== February 1996 – Mir 21 begins ===

==== Progress M-30 Undocked and Soyuz TM-23 Launched ====
On February 21, Soyuz TM-23 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome with the cosmonauts for Mir Principle Expedition 21. To clear a docking port for the Soyuz TM-23, the Progress M-30 was undocked on February 22 and re-entered over the Pacific Ocean. The Soyuz docked on February 23 at the +X docking port on the rear of the Kvant module. An hour and a half after docking, the hatches opened and the Soyuz TM-23 crew were greeted by Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev and Thomas Reiter, members of Mir Principle Expedition 20 and Euromir 95. This began a week of joint operations where Mir 20 handed the station over to Mir 21, including familiarization with the current conditions of the projects and the station itself. Two days before the return flight, a water leak appeared in the Mir base block, but the cosmonauts were able to repair it.

==== Mir 20/Euromir 95 mission ends ====
Gidzenko, Avdeyev and Reiter donned their Sokol launch and reentry suits and entered the Soyuz TM-22 on February 29, 1996. They landed safely about 105 km from Arkalyk. Their mission lasted 179 days, 1 hour and 42 minutes. Reiter then held the record for spaceflight duration by a Western European.

=== March 1996 – Atlantis visits Mir for the third time ===

==== First EVA for Mir 21 ====
On March 15, Onufrienko and Usachev exited the Kvant 2 EVA hatch for their first space walk. Because the existing Strela could not be used to reach the Kristall module in its current location, they installed a second Strela boom on the Mir base block, on the side opposite the Strela already in place. In the 5-hour, 51-minute EVA, they also prepared cables and electrical connectors on the surface of the Kvant module for the May installation of the Mir Cooperative Solar Array. The array was stored on the surface of the Docking Module that was installed on Kristall last November.

==== Atlantis launched ====
The U.S. Space Shuttle Orbiter Atlantis was launched from Kennedy Space Center on March 22 at 11:00 UTC for its sixteenth flight as STS-76. During the ascent phase, flight controllers detected a small leak in one of Atlantis&#x27;s three redundant hydraulic systems, but after the system was shut off when Atlantis reached orbit, the leak stopped. The approximately 20% loss of that one system&#x27;s hydraulic fluid would not adversely affect the mission because the hydraulic system would not be used again until the descent phase.

==== Preparations for docking ====
During the first two days of the mission, Atlantis Commander Kevin Chilton and Pilot Richard Searfoss began jet firings to guide Atlantis&#x27;s journey toward Mir. The crew prepared for the docking by checking out communications equipment and docking and alignment aids. They also activated Spacehab and began orbital operations for Biorack experiments. Mission Specialists Linda Godwin and Michael Clifford checked out the space suits and equipment for their upcoming EVA.

==== Atlantis approaches Mir ====
On mission day 3, when Atlantis was within 8 miles of the station, Chilton fired the orbital maneuvering system engines in the terminal phase initiation burn. As the two spacecraft completed another orbit, Atlantis approached Mir from below along the R-bar, using rendezvous radar to track its approach rate and measure its distance.

==== Third Atlantis/Mir Docking ====
Chilton took manual control at one-half mile below the Mir, executing a 180 degree yaw rotation to align Atlantis with the Docking Module on Kristall. He used the ODS centerline camera as an aid in refining and maintaining the alignment. At 12:34 UTC on March 24, he achieved contact, adding Atlantis to a space station complex that then totaled 230 tons. After confirmation of docking, leak checks and pressurization of the docking vestibule, the hatches were opened and the two crews greeted each other. Shortly afterward, the Atlantis crew installed ducts to aid in circulating air between the two spacecraft during the docking phase.

==== Lucid joins the Mir 21 crew ====
Shannon Lucid officially became a Mir 21 crew member at 12:30 UTC on March 24 after a joint &quot;go&quot; from the Russian and U.S. mission control centers. She became the first in a planned continuous U.S. astronaut presence on Mir until 1998.

==== New supplies brought up on Atlantis ====
In the joint portion of the mission, the two crews loaded into the station more than 1 ton of U.S. science equipment, almost 2 tons of Russian supplies and 15 containers of water totaling about 1.5 tons. Approximately a ton of excess equipment, waste and science payload was transferred from Mir to Atlantis. From their vantage point in orbit, the crews were treated to a good view of the comet Hyakutake. Some of the spacecraft hardware items brought up by Atlantis were replacement gyrodyne, a seat liner kit for Lucid to be placed in a Soyuz module if emergency return to Earth was required and three Russian storage batteries which had been replenished on Earth.

==== Experiment Supplies ====
Some of the new supplies and equipment for onboard experiments included replacement hardware for the Mir glovebox stowage experiments, Mir electric field characterization hardware to measure radio interference inside and around the complex, and a liquid phase sintering experiment that would use the Optizon furnace to bond different metals.

==== Spacehab module work ====
On flight days 4, 5 and 7, the crew worked on the Biorack in the Spacehab module in the Orbiter payload bay. The Biorack contained eleven experiments to investigate the effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation on plants, animal tissues, bacteria, and insects. The various experiments were designed by France, Germany, the U.S., Switzerland and the Netherlands.

==== Pre-EVA procedures ====
In preparation for the EVA, Atlantis&#x27;s cabin air pressure was lowered from 14.7 to 10.2 psia. the hatches were closed between Mir and Atlantis and Atlantis and Spacehab throughout the EVA to allow for sustained cabin depressurization. The Mir crew, including Lucid, stayed inside Mir and the Atlantis crew stayied inside the Orbiter cabin, with Ronald Sega coordinating the space walk activities from inside.

==== SAFER backpacks worn ====
Attached to their regular portable life support system backpack, Godwin and Clifford donned new self-contained backpacks with propulsion systems to allow enough free-flight capability to return an un-tethered astronaut to the spacecraft in an emergency. The device, called the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), was designed for EVAs on docked vehicles which would be unable to quickly retrieve a drifting spacewalker. The backpack was test-flown on STS-64 in September 1994.

==== First EVA by U.S. astronauts at Mir ====
On March 27, Godwin and Clifford performed their 6-hour EVA in Atlantis&#x27; cargo bay and on the exterior of the Mir Docking Module. Their major task was to secure four experiment canisters to handrails on the docking Module. The experiments, collectively called the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP), were designed to record data on orbital debris, and to test potential International Space Station materials by exposing them to the low Earth orbit environment. The four passive experiment canisters would be retrieved by a later STS crew after almost 2 years of data collection. During their work on the Docking Module, the astronauts also evaluated new tether hooks and foot restraints that could be used on both Mir and Shuttle Orbiter exteriors, prototypes of International Space Station EVA equipment. They also retrieved the Mir-mounted camera that had been used in docking alignment during STS-74 in November 1995.

==== Atlantis leaves Mir again ====
The STS-76 and Mir 21 crews bid each other farewell on the morning of March 28. They closed the hatches to their spacecraft, and the astronauts began preparations for undocking and return to Earth. With the steering jets to both spacecraft shut down, Atlantis separated from the Mir Docking Module. Then Chilton reactivated the jets and slowly moved away from Mir. At 600 feet out, he began a fly-around, circled the station twice while the crews took pictures of each other&#x27;s spacecraft, then moved to another orbit.

=== April 1996 – a new module for Mir ===

==== Mir 21 continues with full crew ====
The daily flight plan, or cyclogram, for the Russian-U.S. crew was provided 4 days ahead of schedule by TsUP. A group of NASA science experts in Moscow served as consultants on science activities. The first week after Atlantis&#x27; departure, the crew focused on the Optizon Liquid Phase Sintering Experiment (OLiPSE), processing 70 samples of different metals at high temperatures. The crew also conducted life sciences research and Earth observation photography. Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) monitors were placed throughout the station to record movement that might disrupt experiments. Radiation dosimeters in various locations provided another measurement of the station&#x27;s internal environment. A leak in a coolant loop in the core module was detected in mid-April, but the crew was unable to find the exact location. That loop was turned off and the alternate loop was used.

==== The Priroda Module ====
The long-awaited launch of Priroda, earlier announced for March 10 so that the module would be in place when Lucid arrived at Mir, had been moved forward at least twice: once because of late delivery from the Khrunichev factory and once because a commercial Proton launch in early April took precedence. But on April 23, Priroda was launched from Baikonur atop a SL-13 Proton rocket for a three-day orbital trip to Mir. One of the two battery-powered electrical systems on the spacecraft dropped off-line, eliminating the backup power source for the automatic docking system. If the primary electrical system had also malfunctioned, the Mir crew would have immediately initiated a manual docking.

The Priroda module had a mass of 19.700 kg, a length of ~12 m, a max diameter of ~4.35m and a pressurized volume of ~66 cubic meters. it was the last of the six permanent habitable Mir modules. Priroda was, like Spektr, designed by RKK Energia in the mid- to late-1980s and was built and assembled in the Khrunichev plant between 1989 and 1991. The module&#x27;s two propulsion systems included one for orbit correction during the flight to Mir and rendezvous with Mir and one was for berthing and stabilization during the docking phase. The Priroda module included an unpressurized instrument compartment and an instrument/payload compartment.

The Kurs automatic docking system on Priroda worked flawlessly, as did the electrical system. No problems were encountered on the April 26 docking of the new module at the -X port at the front of the Mir base block.

On April 27, from inside the station, the Mir 21 crew controlled Priroda&#x27;s repositioning with the Lyappa arm to the +Z docking port, directly across from the Kristall module. Thus the Mir complex, with its six habitable modules and Docking Module, attained its final basic configuration. Henceforth, the shape of the complex would change only temporarily, with dockings by Progress, Soyuz and Space Shuttle Orbiter spacecraft.

Because of concern about possible sulfur dioxide leaks from the malfunctioning battery system, a test of the modules&#x27; atmosphere was made before the crew entered. Once inside Priroda, the crew&#x27;s first task was to unbolt the batteries, cap their connectors and place them in plastic bags. The 168 batteries would later be placed in Progress M-31 for disposal. The crew then connected Mir power sources to the Priroda systems and troubleshot the battery problems.

=== May 1996 – Progress M-31 resupply and EVAs ===
==== Progress M-31 brings new supplies ====
A new Progress cargo spacecraft was launched from Baiknour on May 5 and docked under control of the Kurs automatic system at the -X port of the Mir on May 7. For the first time in the station&#x27;s history, all ports of the base block were occupied at the same time. The crew began unloading the vehicle that week, in addition to continuing their science experiments and Priroda activation. They successfully tested the new Mir interface-to-payload systems (MIPS) hardware for downlinking data to the ground and replaced three nickel-cadmium batteries in the Priroda power system. However, a power controller for the system failed, and ground controllers began monitoring and controlling battery charging. The crew finally isolated the coolant loop leak in the core module, but there was no health risk associated with the leak and repair was not immediately scheduled.

==== Cooperative solar array installed over 2 EVAs ====
Onufrienko and Usachev left the station early on May 20 to remove the Mir Cooperative Solar Array from its stowed position on the exterior of the Docking Module at the base of Kristall. They used the new Strela boom installed during their March 15 EVA to reach the array and move it to the Kvant module, where they positioned its cables in preparation for final installation during their next EVA. During the five-hour and 20-minute EVA, they inflated an aluminum and nylon model of a Pepsi Cola can, which they filmed against the backdrop of Earth. The soft drink company paid for the procedure and planned to use it in a television commercial. On May 25, in their third spacewalk of the mission, the cosmonauts were outside the station for five hours and 43 minutes, completing the solar array installation on Kvant. After all connections were made, the array unfurled upon command from inside the station.

==== Mir 21 crew greets STS-77 crew ====
All the crew members exchanged greetings with the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-77 and they held a conference with U.S. and Russian news media.

==== Camera Installed on Priroda Exterior During Fourth Mir 21 EVA ====
On May 30, Onufrienko and Usachev installed the Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Scanner (MOMS), a German remote sensing camera, on the Priroda module. The camera, designed to collect Earth atmosphere and environment data, had been flown earlier on two Shuttle missions, STS-7 in June 1983 and STS-41B in February 1984. After the installation, Lucid activated the system by remote command from inside the station. During the five-hour EVA, the cosmonauts also installed a new handrail on the Kvant-2 to facilitate movements in future spacewalks.

=== June 1996 – EVAs and science ===

==== More experiments Installed during fifth EVA ====
The Particle Impact Experiment and the Mir Sample Return Experiment, U.S. space science experiments brought to orbit inside Priroda, were installed on the exterior of the Kvant 2 module during a June 6 EVA lasing about 3 and a half hours. The cosmonauts also replaced a cassette in the Komza experiment on the surface of Spektr.

==== Rapana Girder assembled on Kvant in the sixth EVA ====
On June 13, the cosmonauts spent over five hours outside Mir, installing and deploying a Rapana girder on the surface of the Kvant module as a platform for installing future experiments on the station exterior. The 5 meter structure was deployed in four sections. Another activity during this EVA was manual deployment of the Travers radar antenna on the exterior of Priroda. The large antenna had failed to deploy fully by command from inside the station.

==== Science work continued ====
In addition to assisting the cosmonauts during EVAs from inside the station, Lucid continued activating equipment, such as the Biotechnology System Facility for long-term biotechnology studies and conducting experiments such as the Humoral Immunity experiment to study spaceflight effects on the human immune system. The crew also monitored various aspects of the spacecraft environment. They took air samples in Spektr and the core module using the Solid Sorbent Air Sampler (SSAS) and the Grab Sample Container (GSC). They recorded effects of spacecraft motion with the SAMS equipment and began evaluation of the Microgravity Isolation Mount (MIM).

=== July 1996 – Greenhouse work and a new U.S. record ===

==== Fourth shuttle docking with Mir delayed ====
On July 12, NASA announced the decision to postpone the July 31 launch of STS-79, the fourth mission Atlantis would dock with Mir, until mid-September. In a post-flight discovery of STS-78, it was found that hot gas had seeped into the joints of the boosters used in STS-78 launch in June. An investigation found that the most probable cause of the leakage was use of a new adhesive and cleaning fluid that was also used on the boosters for STS-79. Although the boosters were judged safe to fly, a decision was made to replace them in order to further study the J-joint failure and improve the safety margin of the joint.

==== U.S. record surpassed ====
On July 15, Lucid surpassed the space duration record for a U.S. astronaut set by Norm Thagard with his 115 days on Mir Principal Expedition 18 in 1996. With the delay to STS-79, her flight record would be even longer than anticipated.

==== Greenhouse work ====
The crew assembled the Svet facility for the Fundamental Biology Greenhouse plant experiment during the latter part of July. A temporary limitation of power in Kristall caused a delay in the first planting, but was solved when ground planners instructed the crew to plug an extension cord into the Spektr&#x27;s power supply. Station maintenance during the last week of July included replacement of a vacuum valve assembly on the carbon dioxide removal system. On July 26, the crew activated the backup oxygen system on August 1.

=== August 1996 - Progress Swap, Experiments and New Arrivals ===

==== Progress M-31 departs and Progress M-32 arrives ====
On August 1 at 16:45 UTC, Progress M-31 left the -X port for destructive reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Launched on July 31 with fresh supplies and hardware for the upcoming Cassiopee mission experiments, Progress M-32 docked at the -X port on August 2.

==== Gyrodynes refurbished ====
The Mir 21 crew began setting up experiments for the upcoming mission. They also refurbished the gyrodyne system, maintaining station attitude by thruster firings from August 5 through the 7th while the gyrodynes were not available.

==== August experimental work ====
The seeds of the first crop of dwarf wheat were planted in the Greenhouse on August 5. Earth observations were made of areas of the United States, Europe and Asia. Lucid continued to run experiments, including the Queen&#x27;s University Experiment in Liquid Diffusion (QUELD), using a furnace to analyze the formation of alloys in space, the Candle Flame in Microgravity (CFM), to study the physiochemical processes of combustion, the Anticipatory Postural Activity (POSA), to measure how muscles work in microgravity, the Forced Flow Framespread test to examine the flame-spreading properties of solid fuels, the Solid Sorbent Air Sampler for Volatile Organic Compounds to evaluation the Mir environment and provided data for the development of advanced life support systems and the Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC), a radiation-dosage measurement device.

==== Mir 22 crew arrives ====
On August 17, Soyuz TM-24 was launched from Baikonur with the new crew for Mir Principal Expedition 22. To free the -X port for docking of the approaching Soyuz, Progress M-32 was undocked on August 18 under automatic control and moved to a parking orbit. It would remain until the departure of Soyuz TM-23 with the homeward-bound Mir 21 crew on September 2. The Soyuz TM-24 docked at the -X port on August 19. The new arrivals were Commander Valery Korzun, Flight Engineer Alexander Kaleri and Cosmonaut Researcher Claudie Andre-Deshays of the French Space Agency (CNES). Andre-Deshays accompanied the Mir 22 crew for a 2-week program of a set of scientific investigations collectively called Cassiopee. She would return to Earth with the Mir 21 crew.

==== Cassiopee mission ====
Andre-Deshays, Korzun and Kaleri worked on PHYSIOLAB, a study of cardiovascular physiology, COGNILAB, tests of neurosensory system responses in microgravity, FERTILE, egg-based studies to determine the role of gravity on embryonic development, ALICE II, experiments in fluid dynamics and CASTOR, analyses of structural dynamics.

=== September 1996 – Mir 21 heads home aboard Soyuz TM-23 ===
Onufrienko, Usachev and Andre-Deshays departed Mir on September 2 in the Soyuz TM-23 spacecraft and safely landed in Central Asia. Onufrienko and Usachev had been in space 194 days, Andre-Deshays 17 days.

<text>Paula Ben-Gurion (née Munweis) (; 8 April 1892 – 29 January 1968) was the wife of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of the State of Israel.

==Biography==
Paula Munweis was born in Minsk, then part of the Russian Empire, the daughter of Samuel Munweis and Bertha Bloch. She immigrated to New York as a teenager where the 1910 United States census gave her date of birth as 1890. She was trained as a nurse at Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, New Jersey and worked in a New York gynaecological clinic. 
David Ben-Gurion met her at the home of her employer and Poale Zion supporter Dr Samuel Ellsberg in summer of 1915. They spoke Yiddish together because Ben-Gurion&#x27;s English was poor and Paula could not speak Hebrew. They married in 1917 at New York City&#x27;s town hall. The following year Ben-Gurion enlisted as a soldier in the new British-raised Jewish Legion. He left Paula three months pregnant. They did not meet again until she arrived, with their one-year-old daughter Geula, in Jaffa 18 months later. Paula was originally against the idea of going to Israel, as her anarchist politics pitted her against both Zionism and state building. Recalling this period Ben-Gurion said that she was not a Zionist, she had very little Jewish feeling, she was an American, she was an anarchist who admired Emma Goldman. She had no interest in Israel. &quot;America is better, why do we need the land of Israel?&quot; 
They had three children, Geula, Amos and Renana. Throughout their marriage she had to endure Ben-Gurion&#x27;s long absences abroad and recurring suspicions, sometimes justified, about his relationships with other women.

She was known for her acerbic tongue. She was fluent in Yiddish, English, and eventually Hebrew. A feisty woman, she had no qualms about asking her husband to wash the dishes. She was bemused by her husband&#x27;s interest in yoga and when his tutor, the famous Moshé Feldenkrais would show up she would say: &quot;Here comes Mr. Hocus Pocus.&quot;

Paula is buried with her husband at the Ben-Gurion Tomb National Park in Midreshet Ben-Gurion in Israel&#x27;s Negev desert.

In 1958, David Ben-Gurion published his letters to her: &quot;Letters to Paula and the Children&quot;.

==Legacy and commemoration==
A number of schools and institutions in Israel are named for her. Leslie Moonves, former president and CEO of CBS Television, is her grand-nephew.

<doc id="851533" wikidata="Q4754607" url="?curid=851533" title="Andover Earth Station">
<text>Andover Earth Station was one of the first satellite earth stations, located at Andover in the US state of Maine. It was built by AT&amp;T in 1961 to communicate with the Telstar 1 satellite, the first direct relay communications satellite. It provided the first experimental satellite telephone and television service between North America and Europe. It was also used with the Relay satellite. The giant horn was dismantled in the mid-1980s along with the visitor center.

The location was selected by AT&amp;T in December 1960. The main factors were the topography (set in the Western Maine Mountains), and the radio interference signal level. Other factors included a location in the Northeastern United States to give a short great circle path to Western Europe, it was located close enough to existing transcontinental radio relay television and telephone routes to facilitate interconnection. In addition, the site had to be large enough to accommodate an antenna structure and control building, and if necessary, provide room for expansion.

Land was purchased in January 1961, and construction of the complex began on May 1. Building construction was completed and the equipment was installed in February 1962. The Ground Station was operational in the Spring of 1962. AT&amp;T and Bell Labs initiated, funded, constructed and took the leadership to make this project possible.

The radio transmitter aboard Telstar was very low-powered compared to modern communication satellites, with a power of only 14 watts, and transmitted through an omnidirectional antenna, so the ground antennas that communicated with it had to be huge, with very large apertures to receive enough radio power from the satellite to be intelligible. The Andover Earth Station was equipped with a giant horn antenna, 7 stories high and weighing 340 tons. To protect it from bad weather, a radome made of Dacron covered the antenna. It was 160 feet (49 m) high, 210 feet (64 m) wide and weighed 30 tons. Since the satellite was not in a geostationary orbit like modern communication satellites, it passed overhead quickly, and the giant antenna had to be precisely steerable to track the satellite as it moved across the sky.

Telstar was launched on July 10, 1962, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and went into orbit at 4:46 a.m. The engineers at the Andover Earth Station would have to wait 15 hours for the satellite, travelling at a rate of 5 miles per second (8 km/s), 3,000 miles (4,800 km) above the earth to reach within their &quot;view&quot;. The engineers successfully sent a signal to Telstar, which amplified it 10 billion times and relayed it back to Andover.

Eugene F. O&#x27;Neill, Telstar Project Director and IEEE Fellow, oversaw the success of this project at Andover. He noted that one of the challenges was pointing an extremely sharp beam very accurately at the satellite. At 7:17 p.m. he announced &quot;We&#x27;ve acquired Telstar!&quot; At 7:31 p.m. an American flag at Andover appeared on the television screen. Then at 7:47 p.m. engineers at Andover received word that the French site, Pleumeur-Bodou, had received the television picture.

The Large radome was torn down and land returned to nature in the mid-1980s.

MCI purchased the Andover Earth station in 1987, MCI was later purchased by Verizon including the Andover Earth station in 2006 and managed under the Verizon Business name. The site still operates to this day as part of Verizon&#x27;s Satellite Solution group supporting satellite operations for Verizon.

<text>Dutch uncle is an informal term for a person who issues frank, harsh or severe comments and criticism to educate, encourage or admonish someone. Thus, a &quot;Dutch uncle&quot; is the reverse of what is normally thought of as avuncular or uncle-like (indulgent and permissive).

==Origins==

During the Anglo-Dutch Wars between England and the Netherlands in the 17th century, the English language gained an array of insults (including &quot;Dutch uncle&quot;), such as:

These terms also gained prominence in 17th-century New England during its rivalry with New Netherland, which the Dutch captured (and later recaptured) during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.

These colorful (though now incongruous) phrases became part of English usage worldwide, and some are still in use today.

==Alternative explanations==
Another proposed explanation is that the term, often expressed as &quot;talk to one like a Dutch uncle,&quot; originated in the early 19th century as an allusion to the sternness and sobriety attributed to the Dutch people. Dutch behaviour is defined in the book &quot;Culture Shock! Netherlands: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette&quot; as &quot;practical, direct, outspoken, stubborn, well-organised, blunt and thinking they are always right.&quot; According to that source, these are the alleged reasons behind the English term &quot;Dutch uncle.&quot; Another book that advocates this theory is &quot;The UnDutchables&quot;, which assigns comparable characteristics to Dutch people: &quot;not lacking in self-esteem ... caught up in a cycle of endless envy ... always speak their mind ... frank, obstinate, blunt&quot;, basically summed up by the phrase &quot;the natives thrive on shaking their fingers at and scolding each other.&quot;

<text>Joseph Spencer (October 3, 1714 – January 13, 1789) was an American lawyer, soldier, and statesman from Connecticut. During the Revolutionary War, he served both as a delegate to the Continental Congress and as a major general in the Continental Army.

==Early life==
Spencer was born in East Haddam, Connecticut Colony. Spencer was the son of Isaac and Mary (née Selden) Spencer. He was the great-grandson of Gerard and Hannah Spencer, who were part of the first settlers of East Haddam in 1662.

==Career==
He was trained as a lawyer and practiced until 1753, when he became a judge. He was active in the militia, serving in King George&#x27;s War and as a Lieutenant Colonel of the Middlesex militia in the French and Indian War.

By the time the American Revolution began, Spencer had advanced to Brigadier General of Connecticut’s militia, and in April 1775 he led them to support the Siege of Boston as the 2nd Connecticut Regiment. In June, when these units were adopted into the national army, he was made a brigadier general in the Continental Army; he was amongst the first eight Continental Army brigadier generals so appointed.

In 1776, Spencer was promoted to major general in support of William Heath in the Eastern Department. The following year his military career became difficult. He cancelled a planned attack on British forces in Rhode Island and was censured by the Continental Congress. He demanded a court of inquiry and was exonerated, but when the controversy was resolved, he resigned his commission on January 14, 1778.

Spencer first served on the Connecticut Council (or Connecticut State Senate) in 1776. Free of military responsibility, the state sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1779. In 1780, he was returned to the council, and served there until his death. From 1784 until his death, he was also a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors. After the Revolutionary War he became eligible for membership in the Society of the Cincinnati of the State of Connecticut.

==Personal life==

August 2, 1738, Joseph Spencer married Martha Brainerd (1716–1754), with whom he had five children.

* Martha Spencer (1739–1739/40), who died young.
* Martha Spencer (), who married Joseph Cone, Jr. (born 1735).
* Anne Spencer (born 1746).
* Joseph Spencer, Jr. (1750–1824), who became a surgeon and served as an aid to his father during the Revolution.
* Nehemiah Spencer (born 1752)

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1754, he married Hannah (née Brown) Southmaid (1730–1808), with whom he had eight more children, including:

* Isaac Spencer (born 1759), who served as Connecticut State Treasurer from 1818 to 1835.
* Jared Spencer (1762–1820), a twin who was a Yale graduate and an attorney who married Ann Green (1768–1855) in 1789.
* Mary Spencer (born 1762), a twin who married Turner Miner.
* Seth Spencer (born 1765)
* Hannah Spencer (1767–1843), who married Rev. Ichabod Lord Skinner (1767–1852)
* Betty Spencer (born 1770), who married Selden Warner.
* Nehemiah Spencer (1772–1839), who married Betsey Swan (died 1853)

Spencer died on January 13, 1789, in East Haddam and was buried in Millington Cemetery west of the Millington Green section of East Haddam near where he lived. Later he and his wife were re-interred at the Nathan Hale Park of East Haddam and a monument was erected in his honor.

===Descendants===

His granddaughter through his son Joseph, Elizabeth Spencer, was married to General Lewis Cass (1782–1866), who also served as governor of the Michigan Territory, a United States senator from the state of Michigan, and as secretary of state under President James Buchanan.

Major General Robert Ernest Noble was Spencer&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson and became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

<text>A. J. Stevens &amp; Co. Ltd was a British automobile and motorcycle manufacturer in operation from 1909 to 1931. The company was founded by Joe Stevens in Wolverhampton, England. After the firm was sold, the name continued to be used by Matchless, Associated Motorcycles and Norton-Villiers on four-stroke motorcycles until 1969, and since the name&#x27;s resale in 1974, on lightweight, two-stroke scramblers and today on small-capacity roadsters and cruisers. The company held 117 motorcycle world records.

== History ==

=== Motorcycles ===


Joe Stevens, father of Harry, George, Albert John (‘Jack’), and Joe Stevens Junior, was an engineer who owned the Stevens Screw Company Ltd, in Wednesfield, near Wolverhampton. Stevens had a reputation for quality engineering before the company built its first motorcycle in 1897, using a Mitchell single-cylinder four-stroke imported from the US. Before long, Stevens began making engines, starting off with a better-built version of the Mitchell but the family soon developed their own designs, including parallel-twins and V-twins, which were sold as proprietary engines to other manufacturers, including Werner, Wolf and Clyno.

In 1909, after a Wearwell motorcycle fitted with a Stevens side-valve single-cylinder engine won a trophy for a 24-hour non-stop run in 1909, Jack Stevens decided to contest the Tourist Trophy in the Isle of Man. A new company, A J Stevens &amp; Co (AJS), was founded, with premises in Retreat Street, Wolverhampton, to manufacture motorcycles and the first model appeared at the Motor Cycle Show in 1910. Its engine, a two-speed 298 cc side-valve, was made to come within the 300 cc limit for Junior machines in the 1911 Isle of Man TT races and was slightly larger than the 292 cc used for the proprietary engines. Jack Stevens came 16th on AJS&#x27;s official entry, one place behind private owner J.D. Corke on an identical machine.

Albert John Stevens lent his initials to the company, but it was a family concern. In 1922 for example, Harry Stevens acted as managing director, George Stevens as commercial manager, Joe Stevens Junior managing the experimental section and Jack Stevens as production manager.

AJS did not contest the 1912 TT as it was busy satisfying the demand for its products, but was 10th in the 1913 Junior. With the Junior limit raised to 350 cc for 1914, the AJS motorcycle had grown to 349 cc, with four-speed gears and chain final drive. AJS achieved their first TT victory in the Junior 1914 Isle of Man TT race that year through Eric Williams, whilst also taking second, third, fourth and sixth place. The old Screw Company&#x27;s facilities could not cope with the demand and with the company reconstituted as &quot;A.J. Stevens and Company (1914) Ltd&quot;, AJS moved to a new factory built around Graiseley House, in the Blakenhall district, a short distance south of the Retreat Street premises, which were relegated to the being the company&#x27;s office and repair department. The 349 cc machine (known as the  hp) was most in demand but the company also produced an 800 cc (6 hp) V-twin.

On 3 November 1916, the Ministry of Munitions prohibited the production of non-military motorcycles, and AJS went over to manufacturing munitions, but in early 1917 the Ministry received an order from Russia for military vehicles, and AJS was given a contract to produce part of the order with its AJS Model D machine. This kept AJS busy until Ministry of Munitions restrictions were lifted in January 1919.

When production of the 350 resumed in 1920, it was much improved. The side-valve engine was replaced by a new overhead-valve design that produced 10 bhp. It also had internal expanding brakes and chain primary drive. Cyril Williams won the first post war 1920 Isle of Man TT Junior race on his 350, even though he had to push the motorcycle home for almost four miles (mostly downhill) after a breakdown. AJS took the first four places in the 1921 Isle of Man TT, and Howard R Davies bettered his second place in the Junior by winning the Senior on the same 350 cc AJS. This was the first time a 350 had won the 500 cc Senior TT race. In 1922 Manxman Tom Sheard won the Junior on an AJS, with G Grinton, also on an AJS, taking second.

The 1922 machine was a classic design that would become famous as the ‘Big Port’ on account of its large-diameter exhaust port and pipe (initially 1 inches, but changed in successive years). The OHV 350 would be the mainstay of the company&#x27;s racing efforts until 1927 and in production form (first offered to the public in 1923), was also AJS&#x27;s most popular sports motorcycle throughout the 1920s. At this time, the company produced a comprehensive range of other models ranging from 250 to 1,000 cc. These were generally given a model number, plus letter to denote the year of manufacture (for example, B meant 1924, F 1925, G 1926).

In 1929 for example, the AJS range consisted of:
M1 Deluxe 996 cc side-valve V-twin £76/10/0;
M2 Standard 996 cc side-valve V-twin £66/0/0;
M3 Deluxe Touring 349 cc side-valve single £48/10/0;
M4 Deluxe Sporting 349 cc side-valve single £48/10/0;
M5 Standard Sporting 349 cc side-valve single £45/0/0;
M6 349 cc overhead-valve single £54/10/0 (twin port), £52/0/0 (single port);
MR6 Special Sports 349 cc overhead-valve single £62/0/0;
M7 349 cc overhead-camshaft single £62/0/0;
M8 498 cc overhead-valve single £62/0/0 (twin port), £59/10/0 (single port);
MR8 Special Sports 498 cc overhead-valve single £72/0/0;
M9 Deluxe Touring 498 cc side-valve £54/0/0;
M10 498 cc overhead-camshaft single £72/0/0;
M12 Lightweight 248 cc side-valve single £39/17/6.
Several of these were intended to pull one of the 12 AJS sidecars also on offer, including sports, touring and commercial models.

By 1927, it had become clear that push-rod overhead-valve designs were becoming dated in racing, so AJS introduced two new chain-driven overhead-camshaft racing models, the 349 cc K7 and the 498 cc K10. Jimmy Simpson rode a 350 to third place in the Junior TT and won races in Europe but in 1928 AJS used the overhead-valve engine in the TT. In 1929 there were again two machines with an overhead cam, this time the 349 cc M7 and the 498 cc M10. Wal Handley came second in the 1929 Junior TT for AJS. The following year Jimmie Guthrie won the 1930 Lightweight TT on a 250 cc AJS. The R7,350 ohc, won 8 of the 9 Grand Prix and established at Montlhery, near Paris, a number of world records, including 1 hour at an average of 104.5 miles per hour and 2 hours at an average of 99.5

In 1931, the AJS S3 V-twin was released, a 496 cc transverse V-twin tourer with shaft &quot;primary&quot; drive and alloy cylinder heads. It had been expensive to develop and was slow to sell. Even though it held 117 world records, the AJS company was now in financial trouble.

The 1935 film &quot;No Limit&quot; was set at the Isle of Man TT. The film starred George Formby as an aspiring racer who travels to the Isle of Man with his modified and streamlined 1928 &quot;Rainbow&quot; motorcycle, which he has christened a &quot;Shuttleworth Snap,&quot; in order to compete at the races. In the film fictitious motorcycle companies were used, and the &quot;Shuttleworth Snap&quot; was in fact a 1928 AJS H5.

=== Automobiles, omnibuses, and coaches ===

Although best known for their motorcycles the company made a few experimental cars with Meadows engines in 1923 but decided not to go into full production.

AJS had manufactured car bodies for Clyno, but in 1929 Clyno went under. AJS returned to car making in 1929 with the Nine powered by a 1018 cc side-valve Coventry-Climax engine producing and driving through a three-speed gearbox. The cars were quite expensive at £210 for the two-seater and £320 for the fabric bodied saloon. About 1,000 were made.

The company also started making buses and coaches. The first model was the Pilot with a Meadows engine. This was followed by the Commodore with a Coventry Climax L6 engine and finally by the Admiral. Just over 200 buses were built.

In 1931, A. J. Stevens &amp; Co went into administration. After BSA failed to obtain control, the motorcycle assets were bought by the Collier brothers London company Matchless and the car manufacturer Crossley Motors. Crossley incorporated some improvements such as a four-speed gearbox and using parts acquired from AJS built about 300 cars between December 1931 and May 1932. Assembly took place in the Stockport factory used by Willys Overland Crossley. Motorcycle production moved to Plumstead in London.

A 1½-litre model was planned, but failed to materialize except to appear on the Willys-Overland-Crossley stand at the 1932 London Motor Show.

In 1938, AJS became part of a group called Associated Motorcycles, formed by the Colliers as a management company for its various interests. After this Matchless and AJS generally shared models using different badging, although the AJS name was used for several unique racers.

The site of the Wolverhampton factory, now a supermarket, is marked by a sculpture, &quot;The Lone Rider&quot;, designed by Steve Field and carved by Robert Bowers, assisted by Michael Scheuermann.

=== Stevens Motorcycles ===
The Stevens brothers tried again and started a new company as Stevens Brothers (Wolverhampton) Ltd to make 3-wheel delivery vans. (They could not call them AJS, as that name belonged to the Colliers.) These used a 588 cc single-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox and chain drive. The van could carry 5 cwt. It was improved in 1935 with shaft drive and uprated to 8 cwt. The last ones were made in 1936. In 1934 they also produced a new range of motorcycles under the Stevens name. These were made until 1938 after which the company continued until 1956 as a general engineering business.

=== AJS Radios ===
AJS designer Harry Stevens was a keen amateur &#x27;ham&#x27; radio operator since before World War I. In 1922, following the launch of Britain&#x27;s first radio stations and the formation of the BBC he convinced the rest of the AJS board that radio receivers had a big future. The first radios made by AJS Wireless and Scientific Instruments were launched in 1923, all high quality models aimed at the top end of the market. The most expensive cost £75, which was substantially more than many AJS motorcycles, although prices soon fell. Initial sales were good and by 1925, there were 10 models ranging from under £14 in a simple wooden case to over £50 with a finely veneered console cabinet. Radio production was increased and moved to a factory in Stewart Street. However, radio technology had advanced rapidly and AJS was forced to offer new designs in order to compete. The company&#x27;s reliance on battery power held them back at a time when rivals were turning to mains power and AJS was forced to adopt cheaper mass-production techniques. In 1928, the company decided to give up radio manufacture and sold the factory and remaining components to the Symphony Gramophone and Radio Company.

== AJS Racing under AMC ==
Under AMC the AJS badge may have been put on the &quot;bread and butter&quot; Matchless motorcycles, but the Colliers were mindful of the AJS racing heritage, and used the name on some innovative racing machinery. These racing bikes kept the AJS name alive.

In 1935, at the Olympia Show, an air-cooled SOHC AJS 50° V4 was shown, a fully equipped road going version, which did not make it into production. In 1936 Harold Daniell rode a supercharged race version in the Isle of Man Senior TT, but despite its high top speed, it lacked acceleration.

In 1939, a water-cooled and supercharged version of the 495 cc AJS V4 was built to compete against the supercharged BMWs then dominating racing. In 1939 the dry sump V4 was the first bike to lap the Ulster Grand Prix course at over . It weighed . and its top speed was . Then World War II intervened.

At the end of the 1940s and start of the 1950s, the AJS Porcupine, a 500 cc forward-facing parallel twin, and the AJS 7R (32 bhp, 350 cc OHC single) were being raced alongside their AMC stablemates the Matchless G50 (effectively a 500 cc 7R) and by 1951, the Matchless G45 (a 500 cc vertical twin). The AJS Porcupine had been designed for supercharging, before the rules changed banning supercharged racing motorcycles, but even so, Les Graham won the 1949 World Championship on an unsupercharged AJS E90 500 cc Porcupine.

In 1951 AJS development engineer Ike Hatch developed a 75.5 mm bore × 78 mm stroke, three-valve-head version of the 7R making . It was called the AJS 7R3, and was Ike&#x27;s response to the Italian multi-cylinder racers. They did well enough in their first year, not as well the second. For 1954 Jack Williams, the works team manager, developed the bike further, lowering the engine in the frame, and making some tuning changes that gave @ 7800 rpm. It immediately won the first two rounds of the World Championship and took first at the Isle of Man TT. These were factory specials, but one has survived, and a second has been reconstructed from spares.

AMC withdrew from the world of works and one-off road racing at the end of the 1954, with the death of Ike Hatch, and in the face of fierce competition from the other European bikes. After this AJS made a production version of the standard two-valve AJS 7R, for privateers. In 1954 Norton was also moved to the Plumstead works.

With the G15 line, AMC had built on the merits of the G12 but there were numerous changes to frame, forks, swinging arm, primary chaincase, transmission, cycle parts and lubrication system. The P11 was the last line of bikes with bonds to AMC. It used a modified G85CS frame but there were stronger forks, completely new cycle parts (making some was rather costly), altered lubrication and modified primary chaincases, to mention a few.

The G15 series was offered as 3 brands: Matchless G15 comprising G15Mk2, G15CS and G15CSR; AJS Model 33 comprising M33Mk2, M33CS and M33CSR; and last not least Norton N15CS (no Norton-branded roadster made as it would compete against the Atlas). The G15 series was produced from 1963 to 1969. They were initially for export only, but by 1965 these models were available in UK and Europe too.

Associated Motorcycles and the AJS name eventually ended up with Norton-Villiers in 1966. In late 1968 the Plumstead works at Burrage Grove, where engines from the Wolverhampton plant and frames from the Manchester plant were assembled into complete machines, were presented with a Greater London Council compulsory purchase order. The Plumstead works closed in July 1969. It is believed that production of the G15 series was halted late in 1968 (model year 1969) with unsold samples on offer through 1969. The AJS Model 33 was the last AJS badged four-stroke produced.

== AJS two-strokes and Norton road racer ==

From 1962 Cotton motorcycles were the main customer for 250 Starmaker engines. The 250 Starmaker engines were used in the Cotton Cobra scrambler and the Telstar Racer. Cotton therefore was very involved in the development of the Starmaker engine..

Peter Inchely formerly from Ariel and BSA was involved with the 250 Road Race project. Inchley rode a Bultaco-based 6-speed, 250 Villiers Starmaker-powered special to 3rd place in the 1966 Lightweight TT. Several pre production AJS 250 Racers were built and raced but the project came to halt in 1967 after an unsuccessful second TT attempt. The scrambles project continued with considerable success.

From 1966 to 1968, Villiers developed the &quot;Stormer&quot; Motocross motorcycle. In 1968 Malcolm Davis won the British 250 Championship on a pre Stormer, Y4 scrambler.

In late 1967, a special project was undertaken with the Stormer. Four bikes were built at Marston Road, all equipped with spark arrestors on the end of the tailpipe and with a rudimentary lighting system. Three of them had 250 cc engines and were badged as AJS machines. The fourth one had the &quot;360&quot; engine (actually only 334 cc) and was badged as a Matchless. This bike was probably the last one built with a Matchless badge and the only two-stroke Matchless. The four bikes were taken on by members of the Royal Air Force motor Sports Association and entered in the 1968 International Six-Days Trial.

The two-stroke AJSs had been built in Wolverhampton, at the Villiers factory but in 1970 the UK government provided a special subsidy that enabled AJS to open a new factory on Walworth Industrial Estate in Andover, where they assembled Stormer off-road motorcycles. The competition department was located next to the famous race track at Thruxton, Andover.

AJS scramblers were produced from 1968 until 1974 in 250, 370 and 410 guises. The early 250 was designated the Y4. In 1969 The 370 (Y5) was added and the name changed to Stormer. The 410 followed in 1972.

A little known about motorcycle was the 37AT Trials bike which was partially built by Cotton Motorcycles using some AJS parts and Villiers&#x27;s 37A engine.

By 1974, Norton Villiers was having financial trouble, and the rights to manufacture the Stormer under the AJS banner were purchased. In September 1974 the business was moved to Goodworth Clatford near Andover. Initially selling spare parts for existing motorcycles, the business expanded to produce complete motorcycles still using the Starmaker-based engines under the FB-AJS name.

The Starmaker/Stormer four-speed engine was becoming outdated and could not compete with the new arrivals from manufacturers such as Husqvarna, CZ and later, scrambles bikes from Maico, Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha.

From 1974 Stormer-based scrambles and trail bikes were sold from modified AJS stock. Keeping the model updated until 1980.
During the early 1980s off-road and trail bike with Austrian Rotax engines of 250 cc, 410 cc and 495 cc were produced.

== AJS Motorcycles Ltd. (today) ==
AJS no longer manufacture bikes. Rather they purchase from companies in China. The bikes have AJS logos and other custom detailing features. Their 124cc range are built around the Jianshe JS125 frame and engine. These are first imported from China then distributed through their UK dealer network and exported to Germany, Portugal, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Japan and S. Korea.

<text>Soyuz TM-25 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight, which launched on February 10, 1997. It transported Russian cosmonauts Vasily Tsibliyev, Aleksandr Lazutkin, and German cosmonaut Reinhold Ewald to Mir.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==
This was the 30th expedition to Mir. An ESA astronaut from Germany was included on the mission.

Soyuz TM-25 is a Russian spacecraft that was launched to carry astronauts and supplies to Mir station. It was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket from Baykonur cosmodrome at 14:09 UT to ferry three cosmonauts for a 162-day stay at the station; it docked with the station at 15:51 UT on 12 February 97. Within meters of automatic approach to the station, a slight misalignment was noted, and the commander of the module had to dock it by manual steering.

<doc id="851547" wikidata="Q1260777" url="?curid=851547" title="Pressure coefficient">
<text>In fluid dynamics, the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number which describes the relative pressures throughout a flow field. The pressure coefficient is used in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Every point in a fluid flow field has its own unique pressure coefficient, .

In many situations in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics, the pressure coefficient at a point near a body is independent of body size. Consequently, an engineering model can be tested in a wind tunnel or water tunnel, pressure coefficients can be determined at critical locations around the model, and these pressure coefficients can be used with confidence to predict the fluid pressure at those critical locations around a full-size aircraft or boat.

==Definition==
The pressure coefficient is a parameter for studying both incompressible/compressible fluids such as water and air. The relationship between the dimensionless coefficient and the dimensional numbers is
:formula_1
where:
: formula_2 is the static pressure at the point at which pressure coefficient is being evaluated
: formula_3 is the static pressure in the freestream (i.e. remote from any disturbance)
: formula_4 is the freestream fluid density (Air at sea level and 15 °C is 1.225 formula_5)
: formula_6 is the freestream velocity of the fluid, or the velocity of the body through the fluid

==Incompressible flow==

Using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation, the pressure coefficient can be further simplified for potential flows (inviscid, and steady):

:formula_7

where: 
: formula_8 is the flow speed at the point at which pressure coefficient is being evaluated
: formula_9 is the Mach number, which is taken in the limit of zero
: formula_10 is the flow&#x27;s stagnation pressure

This relationship is valid for the flow of incompressible fluids where variations in speed and pressure are sufficiently small that variations in fluid density can be neglected. This assumption is commonly made in engineering practice when the Mach number is less than about 0.3.

* formula_11 of zero indicates the pressure is the same as the freestream pressure.
* formula_11 of one corresponds to the stagnation pressure and indicates a stagnation point.
* the most negative values of formula_11 in a liquid flow can be summed to the cavitation number to give the cavitation margin. If this margin is positive, the flow is locally fully liquid, while if it is zero or negative the flow is cavitating or gas.

Locations where formula_14 are significant in the design of gliders because this indicates a suitable location for a &quot;Total energy&quot; port for supply of signal pressure to the Variometer, a special Vertical Speed Indicator which reacts to vertical movements of the atmosphere but does not react to vertical maneuvering of the glider.

In an incompressible fluid flow field around a body, there will be points having positive pressure coefficients up to one, and negative pressure coefficients including coefficients less than minus one.

==Compressible flow==

In the flow of compressible fluids such as air, and particularly the high-speed flow of compressible fluids, formula_15 (the dynamic pressure) is no longer an accurate measure of the difference between stagnation pressure and static pressure. Also, the familiar relationship that stagnation pressure is equal to &quot;total pressure&quot; does not always hold true. (It is always true in isentropic flow, but the presence of shock waves can cause the flow to depart from isentropic.) As a result, pressure coefficients can be greater than one in compressible flow.

=== Perturbation theory ===
The pressure coefficient formula_11 can be estimated for irrotational and isentropic flow by introducing the potential formula_17 and the perturbation potential formula_18, normalized by the free-stream velocity formula_19

:formula_20

Using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation,

:formula_21

which can be rewritten as

:formula_22

where formula_23 is the sound speed.

The pressure coefficient becomes

:formula_24

where formula_25 is the far-field sound speed.

=== Local piston theory ===
The classical piston theory is a powerful aerodynamic tool. From the use of the momentum equation and the assumption of isentropic perturbations, one obtains the following basic piston theory formula for the surface pressure:

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the downwash speed and formula_23 is the sound speed.

:formula_29

The surface is defined as

:formula_30

The slip velocity boundary condition leads to

:formula_31

The downwash speed formula_27 is approximated as

:formula_33

== Hypersonic flow ==

In hypersonic flow, the pressure coefficient can be accurately calculated for a vehicle using Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of fluid motion, which is inaccurate for low-speed flow and relies on three assumptions:

# The flow can be modeled as a stream of particles in rectilinear motion
# Upon impact with a surface, all normal momentum is lost
# All tangential momentum is conserved, and flow follows the body

For a freestream velocity formula_34 impacting a surface of area formula_35, which is inclined at an angle formula_36 relative to the freestream, the change in normal momentum is formula_37 and the mass flux incident on the surface is formula_38, with formula_39 being the freestream air density. Then the momentum flux, equal to the force exerted on the surface formula_40, from Newton&#x27;s second law is equal to:

:formula_41

Dividing by the surface area, it is clear that the force per unit area is equal to the pressure difference between the surface pressure formula_2 and the freestream pressure formula_43, leading to the relation:

:formula_44

The last equation may be identified as the pressure coefficient, meaning that Newtonian theory predicts that the pressure coefficient in hypersonic flow is:
:formula_45

For very high speed flows, and vehicles with sharp surfaces, the Newtonian theory works very well.

=== Modified Newtonian law ===
A modification to the Newtonian theory, specifically for blunt bodies, was proposed by Lester Lees:

:formula_46

where formula_47 is the maximum value of the pressure coefficient at the stagnation point behind a normal shock wave:

:formula_48

where formula_49 is the stagnation pressure and formula_50 is the ratio of specific heats. The last relation is obtained from the ideal gas law formula_51, Mach number formula_52, and speed of sound formula_53. The Rayleigh pitot tube formula for a calorically perfect normal shock says that the ratio of the stagnation and freestream pressure is:

:formula_54

Therefore, it follows that the maximum pressure coefficient for the Modified Newtonian law is:

:formula_55

In the limit when formula_56, the maximum pressure coefficient becomes:

:formula_57

And as formula_58, formula_59, recovering the pressure coefficient from Newtonian theory at very high speeds. The modified Newtonian theory is substantially more accurate than the Newtonian model for calculating the pressure distribution over blunt bodies.

== Pressure distribution ==
An airfoil at a given angle of attack will have what is called a pressure distribution. This pressure distribution is simply the pressure at all points around an airfoil. Typically, graphs of these distributions are drawn so that negative numbers are higher on the graph, as the formula_11 for the upper surface of the airfoil will usually be farther below zero and will hence be the top line on the graph.

== Relationship with aerodynamic coefficients==
All the three aerodynamic coefficients are integrals of the pressure coefficient curve along the chord.
The coefficient of lift for a two-dimensional airfoil section with strictly horizontal surfaces can be calculated from the coefficient of pressure distribution by integration, or calculating the area between the lines on the distribution. This expression is not suitable for direct numeric integration using the panel method of lift approximation, as it does not take into account the direction of pressure-induced lift. This equation is true only for zero angle of attack.

:formula_61

where:

:formula_62 is pressure coefficient on the lower surface
:formula_63 is pressure coefficient on the upper surface
:formula_64 is the leading edge location
:formula_65 is the trailing edge location

When the lower surface formula_11 is higher (more negative) on the distribution it counts as a negative area as this will be producing down force rather than lift.

<text>PDCA or plan–do–check–act (sometimes called plan–do–check–adjust) is an iterative design and management method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products. It is also known as the [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] cycle, or the control circle/cycle. Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA. The added stands for &quot;observation&quot; or as some versions say: &quot;Observe the current condition.&quot; This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System. The PDCA cycle, with Ishikawa&#x27;s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959.

The PDCA cycle is also known as PDSA cycle (where S stands for &quot;study&quot;). It was an early means of representing the task areas of traditional quality management. The cycle is sometimes referred to as the Shewhart / Deming cycle since it originated with physicist Walter Shewhart at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1920s. W. Edwards Deming modified the Shewhart cycle in the 1940s and subsequently applied it to management practices in Japan in the 1950s.

Deming found that the focus on Check is more about the implementation of a change, with success or failure. His focus was on predicting the results of an improvement effort, Study of the actual results, and comparing them to possibly revise the theory.

==Meaning==
===Plan ===
Establish objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results.

===Do===
Carry out the objectives from the previous step.

===Check===
During the check phase, the data and results gathered from the do phase are evaluated. Data is compared to the expected outcomes to see any similarities and differences. The testing process is also evaluated to see if there were any changes from the original test created during the planning phase. If the data is placed in a chart it can make it easier to see any trends if the plan–do–check–act cycle is conducted multiple times. This helps to see what changes work better than others and if said changes can be improved as well.

Example: Gap analysis or s

===Act===
Also called &quot;adjust&quot;, this act phase is where a process is improved. Records from the &quot;do&quot; and &quot;check&quot; phases help identify issues with the process. These issues may include problems, non-conformities, opportunities for improvement, inefficiencies, and other issues that result in outcomes that are evidently less-than-optimal. Root causes of such issues are investigated, found, and eliminated by modifying the process. Risk is re-evaluated. At the end of the actions in this phase, the process has better instructions, standards, or goals. Planning for the next cycle can proceed with a better baseline. Work in the next do phase should not create a recurrence of the identified issues; if it does, then the action was not effective.

==About==
Plan–do–check–act is associated with W. Edwards Deming, who is considered by many to be the father of modern quality control; however, he used PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) and referred to it as the &quot;Shewhart cycle&quot;. The PDSA cycle was used to create the model of know-how transfer process, and other models.

The concept of PDCA is based on the scientific method, as developed from the work of Francis Bacon (&quot;Novum Organum&quot;, 1620). The scientific method can be written as &quot;hypothesis–experiment–evaluation&quot; or as &quot;plan–do–check&quot;. Walter A. Shewhart described manufacture under &quot;control&quot;—under statistical control—as a three-step process of specification, production, and inspection. He also specifically related this to the scientific method of hypothesis, experiment, and evaluation. Shewhart says that the statistician &quot;must help to change the demand [for goods] by showing [...] how to close up the tolerance range and to improve the quality of goods.&quot; Clearly, Shewhart intended the analyst to take action based on the conclusions of the evaluation. According to Deming, during his lectures in Japan in the early 1950s, the Japanese participants shortened the steps to the now traditional &quot;plan, do, check, act&quot;. Deming preferred &quot;plan, do, study, act&quot; because &quot;study&quot; has connotations in English closer to Shewhart&#x27;s intent than &quot;check&quot;.
A fundamental principle of the scientific method and plan–do–check–act is iteration—once a hypothesis is confirmed (or negated), executing the cycle again will extend the knowledge further. Repeating the PDCA cycle can bring its users closer to the goal, usually a perfect operation and output.

Plan–do–check–act (and other forms of scientific problem solving) is also known as a system for developing critical thinking. At Toyota this is also known as &quot;Building people before building cars&quot;. Toyota and other lean manufacturing companies propose that an engaged, problem-solving workforce using PDCA in a culture of critical thinking is better able to innovate and stay ahead of the competition through rigorous problem solving and the subsequent innovations.

Deming continually emphasized iterating towards an improved system, hence PDCA should be implemented in spirals of increasing knowledge of the system that converge on the ultimate goal, each cycle closer than the previous. One can envision an open coil spring, with each loop being one cycle of the scientific method, and each complete cycle indicating an increase in our knowledge of the system under study. This approach is based on the belief that our knowledge and skills are limited, but improving. Especially at the start of a project, key information may not be known; the PDCA—scientific method—provides feedback to justify guesses (hypotheses) and increase knowledge. Rather than enter &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; to get it perfect the first time, it is better to be approximately right than exactly wrong. With improved knowledge, one may choose to refine or alter the goal (ideal state). The aim of the PDCA cycle is to bring its users closer to whatever goal they choose.

When PDCA is used for complex projects or products with a certain controversy, checking with external stakeholders should happen before the Do stage, since changes to projects and products that are already in detailed design can be costly; this is also seen as Plan-Check-Do-Act.

The rate of change, that is, the rate of improvement, is a key competitive factor in today&#x27;s world. PDCA allows for major &quot;jumps&quot; in performance (&quot;breakthroughs&quot; often desired in a Western approach), as well as kaizen (frequent small improvements). In the United States a PDCA approach is usually associated with a sizable project involving numerous people&#x27;s time, and thus managers want to see large &quot;breakthrough&quot; improvements to justify the effort expended. However, the scientific method and PDCA apply to all sorts of projects and improvement activities.

<text>Soyuz TM-26 was a Russian spaceflight that ferried cosmonauts and supplies to Mir. It was the 32nd expedition to Mir. It was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome on August 5, 1997. The main mission was to transport two specially-trained cosmonauts to repair or salvage the troubled space station.

TM-26 docked with Mir on August 7 by manual control. The crew repaired the power cable and harness/connectors in the severely damaged Spektr module and restored much of the lost power; they also repaired and replaced the oxygen generators in Mir. The hole(s) in that module that caused total depressurization of the module could not be located during their spacewalk inside that module.

During the flight a television advertisement starring Vasily Tsibliyev was filmed on the station. The ad, for Tnuva&#x27;s brand of UHT milk, was the first ad to be filmed in space.

<text>Alba was an Italians car manufacturer based in Trieste, which started operations in 1906 with two companies

named Alba Fabbrica Automobili S.A. and Alba Automobilwerke Aktiengesellschaft. The company was founded by automobile enthusiasts from influential families of Trieste, Edmondo Richetti, Ettore Modiano and others. The company planned to build two models of car, firstly one with 18-24hp output and the second with 35-40hp output, but only the second model made it to production with a 6,868 cc inline 4-cylinder engine and a 4 speed manual gearbox. It was showcased at the Paris Motor Show in 1907 where the model was praised by the visitors. Despite the attention and appreciation the model received, the company failed to mass produce the vehicle and the company closed its operations in 1908. At the time of liquidation the company had 10 units of the 35-40hp model car, a 20,000 sq ft production plant in San Sabba and 150 employees.

<text>The Alba was a French car made by Constructions Métallurgiques, Usines Alba, Suresnes, Seine between 1913 and 1928.

==Engines==
The car was offered with a choice of 4-cylinder engines, including a side-valve of 1172 cc made by S.C.A.P., a 1476 cc overhead-valve by S.C.A.P., and a 1994 cc Altos with either side valves or overhead valves.

==Transmission and brakes==
The rear wheels were driven through a 4-speed gearbox. Albas were also fitted with front-wheel brakes, an advanced feature on a light car of the time. In 1921 a smaller 1243 cc model, the Bobby Alba, was offered with 3-speed gearbox.

==Racing==
In 1924, Alba entered the Le Mans 24-hour race, but without success.

<text>Soyuz TM-29 was a Russian Soyuz spaceflight launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome aboard a Soyuz 11A511U rocket. It docked with Mir on February 22, 1999 at 05:36 GMT with cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev of Russia, Jean-Pierre Haigneré of France, and Ivan Bella of Slovakia aboard. Since two crew seats had been sold (to Slovakia and France), Afanasyev was the only Russian cosmonaut aboard. This meant that Russian engineer Avdeyev already aboard Mir would have to accept a double-length assignment. After the February 27 departure of EO-26 crew commander Padalka and cosmonaut Bella aboard Soyuz TM-28, the new EO-27 Mir crew consisted of Afanasyev as Commander, Avdeyev as Engineer and French cosmonaut Haigneré.

==Mission highlights==
38th expedition to Mir.

==Certifications and sales==


==Exhibitions inspired by the album==
In 2019, Greek artist Stefanos Rokos, presented his artistic approach to the album &quot;No More Shall We Part&quot; by Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, an art exhibition that started its journey in Greece and travelled to Antwerp, Belgium. The NMSWP part project is a testimony of Stefanos Rokos&#x27; personal proposal for a dialectic to be developed between two artistic forms- those of painting and songwriting, which have all along constituted the very core of artistic expression and creativity.

Nick Cave said about the paintings: &quot;It was extraordinary to stand in the studio and see the paintings for real – the grandeur of them, with all their congested details and terrifying blank spaces. I feel connected to the essence of them. I feel they are very close to the way I write lyrics – intense bursts of memory, ecstatic detail, sudden erotics, esoteric imagery; the forging of frozen narratives that hover about like dreams, haunted and strange and life-affirming.&quot;

<doc id="851574" wikidata="Q2587062" url="?curid=851574" title="Progressive utilization theory">
<text>The Progressive utilization theory (PROUT) is a socioeconomic and political philosophy created by the Indian philosopher and spiritual leader Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. He first conceived of PROUT in 1959. Its proponents (Proutists) claim that it exposes and overcomes the limitations of capitalism, communism and mixed economy. Since its genesis, PROUT has had an economically progressive approach, aiming to improve social development in the world. It is in line with Sarkar&#x27;s Neohumanist values which aim to provide &quot;proper care&quot; to every being on the planet, including humans, animals and plants.

PROUT has not been implemented in any part of the world, though there are a number of books and articles on the subject.

== History ==

In 1959, Sarkar started to develop the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book &quot;Ananda Sutram&quot;, published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.

A number of organizations have been created for the promotion and dissemination of Prout, such as Proutist Universal, Prout Globe, Prout Institute, etc. Since the 1980s a number of cooperative communities have been established across the world by Ananda Marga in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes a socioeconomic system that is an advancement on capitalism and, what Prout sees as &quot;the largely outdated&quot; system of communism. Under the system, resources would be collective property from which usufructuary rights are carved out for use by individuals or groups of individuals. Distribution of goods in a market has to be rational and equitable, so that the allocation of a good maximizes the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people. There must always be a baseline distribution that intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to industrial organization. Key industries and public utilities would operate on a no profit - no loss basis as these are resources held on trust for the public. Decentralized industry run by cooperatives would provide people&#x27;s minimum necessities and other amenities of life. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers&#x27; and consumers&#x27; cooperatives. Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses. A small business sector would also operate providing goods and services on a more individualized basis.

At the political level, Prout discourages nationalism, though nation-states would form a world government in the form of a confederation. There would be a world constitution and a bill of rights for human being, and for ensuring the biological diversity and security of animals and plants. Locally governed self-sufficient socio-economic units or zones would support a decentralized economy.

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
Prout takes account of Sarkar&#x27;s law of social cycle. It sees the social order as consisting of four classes of people that cyclically dominate society: &quot;shudras&quot; (workers), &quot;kshatriyas&quot; (warriors), &quot;vipras&quot; (intellectuals) and &quot;vaishyas&quot; (acquisitors).

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as &quot;... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will.&quot; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.

Prout sees the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time. That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world. To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a &quot;spiritual elite&quot; sadvipras (etymologically &quot;sad&quot; – true, &quot;vipra&quot; – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership. Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.

Sadvipras would be organized into executive, legislative, and judicial boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board. They would be responsible for the order of dominance within the social order.

=== Neohumanism ===

The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar&#x27;s Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of humanism integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.

=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Prout was formally outlined in sixteen aphorisms (see Chapter 5 of &quot;Ananda Sutram&quot;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Idea and Ideology&quot;.

=== The market ===
As far as Prout&#x27;s values and goals differ from those of capitalism and communism, so does its economic structure. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout&#x27;s propounder argues that these philosophies are &quot;anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc.

Another criticism of neo-liberalism and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the degeneration of society.

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required. He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the USSRs experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the Soviet central planning committees (Gosplan) had too much economic decision and cohesion power in the federation (see Marxism–Leninism).

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of market planning that help to create and sustain a healthy economy. In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of neo-liberal economics where profit-motive speaks highest. However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with. (see diseconomies of scale). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see decentralized planning).

Prout also claims that the nationalization of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running. Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a &quot;no-profit, no-loss&quot; principle.

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Sarkar argues for an &quot;optimal inequality&quot; where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided. Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with &quot;negative consequences&quot; in terms of social development. Nonetheless, Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, this theory argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritorious in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist&#x27;s motto of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like Mondragon or Whole Foods.

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand, where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality. As Roar Bjonnes, a known Proutist, states, &quot;Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough.&quot;

Prout, therefore, advocates an economic democracy where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one. The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region. Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike capitalism, where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity. The third requirement of economic democracy is the decentralization of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders. That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export. In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community. From a Neohumanist perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or &quot;samaja&quot; in Sanskrit, is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local community, built on strong feelings of solidarity and self-identity. There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit. Similar to bioregions, their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant. Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.

=== Progress ===
From Prout&#x27;s perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or its GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society. It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of &quot;A new Paradigm of Development,&quot; reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development. Moving along the lines of the triple bottom line that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a &quot;fourth bottom line&quot;, characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the summum bonum of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals. Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay. There are multifarious diseases that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the &quot;supra-emotional values&quot; intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.

&quot;The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one&#x27;s consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness.&quot;

From a Maslownian perspective, Prout defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world. The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Reception==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.

Ravi Batra was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller &quot;The Great Depression of 1990&quot;. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like Johan Galtung, founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that &quot;Sarkar’s theory is far superior to Adam Smith’s or that of Marx.&quot; 

According to a description by Terry Irving and Rowan Cahill, Prout &quot;envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth.&quot; Sohail Inayatullah stated that the philosophy &quot;attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution.&quot; David Skrbina characterized Prout as a &quot;model of social development... which advocates a &#x27;small is beautiful&#x27; approach to society.&quot; Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar&#x27;s economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor John A. Ryan, E. F. Schumacher and Herman Daly in Sarkar&#x27;s incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.

It has been characterized as a form of &quot;progressive socialism&quot; as well as a &quot;socialist theory&quot;.

Hans Despain noted, in &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of David Schweickart, Gar Alperovitz and Richard D. Wolff. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.

<text>The Albany was an English automobile, manufactured by the Albany Motor Carriage Company in Christchurch, Dorset from 1971 - 1997.

==History==
The company was run by two brothers, Bryan and David Shepherd.

The car was designed as a veteran car, in the Edwardian style, but is not a replica of any particular marque although it bears some resemblance to a 1908 Buick. Early models used the BMC A-series engine and suspension from the Morris Minor in a specially built tubular steel chassis. The engine was governed to allow a maximum speed of . The car was hand built and quite expensive at £1987 before a long list of extras was added. Purchasers requiring a hood or a screen found themselves invited to pay an extra £70 or £50 for these luxuries.

From 1974 a 1300 cc Standard SC engine from the Triumph Spitfire was used and a longer wheelbase five-seat option came in 1976.

Albany also made a replica 1910 AEC open air bus, based on a Ford D Series lorry chassis, that now provides very brief quasi-vintage bus rides at the Beaulieu motor museum in Hampshire. It appeared in the 1970s remake of the film &#x27;The 39 Steps&#x27; starring Robert Powell.

In 1973 about a car every two weeks was being produced and exports to the United States started. However, after about 12 cars were shipped the importing company failed. The price in 1974, now with a 1500cc Triumph engine had risen to £2487. By 1977 110 cars had been built.

As of 1992, the open-top Albany featuring a 1500 cc SC engine was being built for export only.

The company closed in 1997.

<text>Albar is a Swiss car maker, built since 1978 in Buochs by Alois Barmettler.

Barmettler had for some time made Dune Buggy and cross country conversions based on the VW Beetle.

In the early 1980s he moved on to make a coupé styled car with two-seater glass fibre body made in Austria. They were sold in Switzerland as the Albar Jet and Austria as the Strato.

In 1982 he started to make the open Sonic model which no longer relied on the Beetle floor pan but had a proper space frame. Later versions could have VW Straight-4 or Renault 25 engines. A fixed head coupé version was also made.</text><links>

<doc id="851580" wikidata="Q509490" url="?curid=851580" title="Soyuz TM-30">
<text>Soyuz TM-30 (, &quot;Union TM-30&quot;), also known as Mir [[List of Mir Expeditions|EO]]-28, was a Soyuz mission, the 39th and final human spaceflight to the Mir space station. The crew of the mission was sent by MirCorp, a privately funded company, to reactivate and repair the station. The crew also resupplied the station and boosted the station to an orbit with a low point (perigee) of 360 and a high point (apogee) of 378 kilometers (223 and 235 miles, respectively); the boost in the station&#x27;s orbit was done by utilizing the engines of the Progress M1-1 and M1-2 spacecraft. At that time a transit between Mir and the International Space Station was already impossible - such a transfer was deemed undesired by NASA - and the orbital plane of ISS had been chosen some time before to be around 120 degrees away from that of Mir. The mission was the first privately funded mission to a space station.

The mission was part of an effort by MirCorp to refurbish and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was nearing the end of its operational life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.

==Crew==
Soyuz TM-30 was the first spaceflight for flight commander Zalyotin, who became a cosmonaut in 1990 and completed his general training two years later in 1992. TM-30 was the third visit to space made by flight engineer Kaleri, who became a cosmonaut in 1984 and completed general training in 1986. He served as flight engineer aboard the Soyuz TM-14 and TM-24 missions to Mir in 1992 and 1996–7, respectively.

===Backup crew===

While Soyuz TM-30 was in orbit, a second privately funded mission was being planned to continue the restoration efforts aboard Mir. The crew assigned to this mission, although never flown, was reported to have been the backup crew for TM-30, cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov.

==Background==

Soyuz TM-30 was intended by MirCorp to be the first in a series of missions to refurbish the 14-year-old Mir space station for commercial use. Although the mission was scheduled to last approximately two months, commander Sergei Zalyotin said before the flight that if additional funds became available the mission could be extended until August, when another crew would replace them. The other possible scenario, which occurred in reality, was again to leave the station uninhabited, as had been done several months before the mission. Towards the end of Soyuz TM-30 plans were formed to send another privately funded mission to continue with MirCorp&#x27;s maintenance efforts; cosmonauts Salizhan Sharipov and Pavel Vinogradov were tentatively assigned as the crew.

Actor Vladimir Steklov trained and was initially assigned for a 2000 flight on Soyuz TM-30 to film scenes for the movie &quot;Thieves and Prostitutes. Spaceflight is the Prize&quot; on &quot;Mir&quot;. The plans were scrapped weeks before launch due to lack of funding, and space scenes were filmed in studio instead.

==Mission highlights==

Soyuz TM-30 launched at 05:01:29 UT on April 4, 2000. Docking occurred on April 6 at 06:31:24 UT. Although the Soyuz docking system is automated under normal conditions, the final few meters of the approach to the station were executed in manual mode. The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft&#x27;s approach to the targeted docking port. At about 09:32 UT on the day of docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.

On April 25, an uncrewed Progress resupply mission, Progress M1-2, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome to the station to deliver supplies to the crew. Progress M1-2 docked with Mir on April 27. On April 26, the Progress M1-1 spacecraft, which had been docked since February and was used by the Russian Federal Space Agency to boost the station to a higher orbit, undocked and de-orbited over the Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.

The mission&#x27;s only Extra-Vehicular Activity, or spacewalk, took place on May 12, between 10:44 and 15:36 UTC. The primary objectives of the spacewalk were to repair damage to Mir&#x27;s exterior components and record panoramas of the station&#x27;s hull in order for experts on Earth to analyze the effects of space on the station itself. The cosmonauts inspected a malfunctioning solar array on the Kvant-1 module of the station. They discovered that a burnt-through wire connecting the array with its steering system was preventing its proper rotation. The array was subsequently deemed a loss.

On June 15, 2000, the TM-30 spacecraft undocked from the station at about 21:24 UT. The de-orbit burn occurred at about 23:52 UT and landing followed at about 00:44 UT on June 16, about southeast of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan.&#x27;

==Milestones==

Soyuz TM-30 was the first privately funded crewed space expedition but several other firsts were also achieved, including the first privately funded extra-vehicular activity, and the first privately funded uncrewed resupply mission to a space station, utilizing the Progress-M1 spacecraft. Soyuz TM-30 also managed to delay the de-orbit of Mir, which was originally scheduled to occur some time in 2000, but ultimately occurred in March 2001.

<doc id="851581" wikidata="Q2603179" url="?curid=851581" title="Albatros (1922 automobile)">
<text>The Albatros was an English automobile manufactured in Croft Road, Coventry and founded in 1922 by H.T.W. Manwaring. The origin of the name is reputed to be derived from a play on the name of one Albert Ross, who was Manwaring&#x27;s mentor and boss earlier in his career. 

There were two models, an 8 and a 10 hp, both using side-valve Coventry-Climax engines. 

The 1247 cc 10 hp was sold in two versions. The Utility model had a three-speed gearbox and shaft drive to a rear axle with no differential and rear-wheel brakes only. It was only available with open two-seat coachwork and cost £200. The Special Touring model was similar in mechanical specification but did have a differential and electric starting and was available with a variety of bodies including closed saloons or as chassis only. It cost between £190 (chassis only) and £275 for the 2-seat coupe.

In late 1923 the 10 hp was joined by a smaller 1094 cc 8 hp with 2-seat body at £165 or a sports model at £190.

In 1924 the company appears to have been in financial difficulties and moved to new premises at Bedford Street, Coventry. A new car was launched still rated at 10 hp but with a larger 1368 cc engine still by Coventry-Climax and priced at £210 but they failed to take a stand at the London Motor Show that year and the company seems to have been declared bankrupt at the end of the year.

Only a few cars were ever made and it is thought that only two survive.

There was also an Albatros company based in Paris, France, who made motor cycles and cars in 1912.

<text>The Albatross was an American sports car venture that was planned in 1939, but never got off the ground. The plan had been to market an ultra-streamlined four-seat tourer body, built on a standard Mercury chassis which was extended to a wheelbase, based on a European custom-made car owned by cartoonist Peter Arno. The proposed car was advertised in at least one periodical, and at least one was built.

<doc id="851586" wikidata="Q131264" url="?curid=851586" title="Therizinosaurus">
<text>Therizinosaurus (; meaning &#x27;scythe lizard&#x27;) is a genus of very large therizinosaurid dinosaurs that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period in what is now the Nemegt Formation around 70 million years ago. It contains a single species, Therizinosaurus cheloniformis. The first remains of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; were found in 1948 by a Mongolian field expedition in the Gobi Desert and later described by Evgeny Maleev in 1954. The genus is only known from a few bones, including gigantic manual unguals (claw bones), from which it gets its name, and additional findings comprising fore and hindlimb elements that were discovered from the 1960s through the 1980s.

&quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a colossal therizinosaurid that could grow up to long and tall, and weigh possibly over . Like other therizinosaurids, it would have been a slow-moving, long-necked, high browser equipped with a rhamphotheca (horny beak) and a wide torso for food processing. Its forelimbs were particularly robust and had three fingers that bore unguals which, unlike other relatives, were very stiffened, elongated, and only had significant curvatures at the tips. &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; had the longest known manual unguals of any land animal, reaching above in length. Its hindlimbs ended in four functionally weight-bearing toes differing from other theropod groups in which the first toe was reduced to a dewclaw and also resembling the very distantly related sauropodomorphs.

It was one of the last and the largest representative of its unique group, the Therizinosauria (formerly known as Segnosauria; the segnosaurs). During and after its original description in 1954, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; had rather complex relationships due to the lack of complete specimens and relatives at the time. Maleev thought the remains of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; to belong to a large turtle-like reptile, and also named a separate family for the genus: Therizinosauridae. Later on, with the discovery of more complete relatives, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and kin were thought to represent some kind of Late Cretaceous sauropodomorphs or transitional ornithischians, even though at some point it was suggested that it may have been a theropod. After years of taxonomic debate, nevertheless, they are now placed in one of the major dinosaur clades, Theropoda, specifically as maniraptorans. &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; is widely recovered within Therizinosauridae by most analyses.

The unusual arms and body anatomy (extrapolated after relatives) of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; have been cited as an example of convergent evolution with chalicotheriines and other primarily herbivorous mammals, suggesting similar feeding habits. The elongated hand claws of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; were more useful when pulling vegetation within reach rather than being used for active attack or defense because of their fragility, however, they may have had some role for intimidation. Its arms also were particularly resistant to stress, which suggests a robust use of these limbs. &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a very tall animal, likely having a reduced competition over the foliage in its habitat and outmatching predators like tyrannosaurid &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;.

==History of discovery==

In 1948, several Mongolian Paleontological expeditions organized by the USSR Academy of Sciences were conducted in the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert, Southwestern Mongolia, with the main objective of new fossils findings. The expeditions unearthed numerous dinosaur and turtle fossil remains from the stratotype locality Nemegt (also known as Nemegt Valley), but the most notable elements collected were three partial manual unguals (claw bones) of considerable size. This set of unguals was found on a subdivision of the Nemegt locality designated as Quarry V near the skeleton of a large theropod, but also in association with other elements including a metacarpal fragment and several ribs fragments. It was labelled under the specimen number PIN 551-483 and later on, these fossils were described by the Russian paleontologist Evgeny Maleev in 1954 who used them to scientifically name the new genus and type species &quot;Therizinosaurus cheloniformis&quot;, becoming the holotype specimen. The generic name, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, is derived from the Greek (, meaning scythe, reap or cut) and (, meaning lizard) in reference to the enormous manual unguals, and the specific name, &quot;cheloniformis&quot;, is taken from the Greek (, meaning turtle) and Latin formis as the remains were thought to belong to a turtle-like reptile. Maleev also coined a separate family for this new and enigmatic taxon: Therizinosauridae. Since little was known of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; at the time of the original description, Maleev thought PIN 551-483 belonged to a large, long turtle-like reptile that relied on its giant hand claws to harvest seaweed.

Though it was not fully understood to what general kind of animal these fossils belonged, in 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky was one of the first authors to suggest that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a theropod and not a turtle. He made comparisons between &quot;Chilantaisaurus&quot; and the holotype unguals of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; to propose that the appendages actually came from a carnosaurian dinosaur, thereby interpreting &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; as a theropod. Rozhdestvensky also illustrated the three holotypic manual unguals and re-identified the metacarpal fragment as a metatarsal bone, and based on the unusual shape of both metatarsal and ribs fragments he listed them as sauropod remains. These theropodan affinities were also followed by the Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska and co-author Ewa Roniewicz in 1970 during their naming and description of &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;—another large and enigmatic theropod from the formation that was initially known from partial arms. Similar to Rozhdestvensky, they suggested that the holotype unguals were more likely to have belonged to a carnosaurian theropod, rather than a large marine turtle.

===Additional specimens===

Further expeditions in the Nemegt Formation unearthed more fossils of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. In 1968 prior to Rozhdestvensky, Osmólska and Roniewicz statements, the upper portion of a manual ungual was found in the Altan Uul locality and labeled as MPC-D 100/17 (formerly IGM or GIN). In 1972, another fragmented ungual (specimen MPC-D 100/16) was discovered at the Upper White Beds of the Hermiin Tsav locality, only preserving its lower portion. During the year 1973, a much more complete, larger, and articulated specimen was collected also from Hermiin Tsav. This specimen was labelled as MPC-D 100/15 and consists of both left and right arms including the scapulocoracoids, both humeri (upper arm bones), right ulna with radius and left ulna, two right carpals, the right metacarpus including a complete digit Il, and some ribs with gastralia (belly ribs). As common with fossils, some elements were not entirely preserved such as the scapulocoracoids with broken ends, and the left arm is less complete than the right one. All of these specimens were first described and referred to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; by the Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold in 1976. In this new monograph, he pointed out that the rib fragments in MPC-D 100/15 were more slender than the ones from the holotype, and identified MPC-D 100/16 and 100/17 as pertaining to digits I and III, respectively. It was clear to Barsbold that MPC-D 100/15 represented &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; as the ungual in this specimen shared the elongation and flattened morphology of all previous specimens. He concluded that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a theropod taxon since MPC-D 100/15 matched multiple theropodan characters.

Also during the year 1973, the specimen MPC-D 100/45 was discovered by the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition at the Hermiin Tsav locality. Unlike the previous findings, MPC-D 100/45 is represented by a right hindlimb composed of a very fragmented femur with the lower end of the tibia, astragalus, calcaneum, tarsal IV, a functional tetradacyl feet (four-toed) compromising four partial metatarsals, partially preserved digits I and III, and nearly complete digits II and IV. These newer remains were described by the also Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle in 1982. He regarded the referral of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and Therizinosauridae to Chelonia (turtles order) to be unlikely, and hypothesized &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;—at the time of this description regarded as a theropod dinosaur—to be particularly similar based on their respective scapulocoracoid morphology, only differing in size. Perle referred MPC-D 100/45 to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; given that this specimen was found near the location of MPC-D 100/15 and was virtually similar to the described pes for &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. In 1990, Barsbold and Teresa Maryanska agreed with Perle in that the hindlimb material from Hermiin Tsav he described in 1982 was therizinosaurian (then called segnosaurians) given that the metatarsus was stocky and the astragalus had a laterally arched ascending process (bony extension), but cast doubt with his referral of it to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and the segnosaurian identity for this taxon since it was only known from the pectoral girdle and other forelimb elements, making direct comparisons between specimens impossible. They considered this specimen to represent a Late Cretaceous representative of the Segnosauria, but not &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;.

In 2010 however, the North American paleontologist Lindsay E. Zanno in her large taxonomic reevaluation of Therizinosauria considered the referral of MPC-D 100/45 to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; to be likely based on the rationale that it was collected in the same stratigraphic context (Nemegt Formation) as the holotype, and shared the robust and four-toed morphology of other therizinosaurids such as &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. She also excluded the rib material from the holotype as it was re-identified by Rozhdestvensky to likely have come from a sauropod dinosaur, and not &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; itself.

==Description==

For maniraptoran standards, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; obtained enormous sizes, estimated to have reached in length with estimated heights from and ponderous weights from to possibly over . These dimensions make &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; the largest therizinosaur known and the largest known maniraptoran. Along with the contemporaneous ornithomimosaur &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;, it was the largest maniraptoriform. Though the body remains of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; are relatively incomplete, inferences can be made about its physical characteristics based on more complete and related therizinosaurids. Like other members of its family, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; had a proportionally small skull bearing a rhamphotheca (horny beak) atop its long neck; bipedal gaits; a large belly for foliage processing; and sparse feathering. Other traits that were likely present in &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; include a heavily pneumatized (air-filled) vertebral column and a robustly-built, (backwards oriented) .

In 2010, Senter and James used hindlimb length equations to predict the total length of the hindlimbs in &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;. They concluded that an average &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; may have had approximately long legs. More recently, Mike Taylor and Matt Wedel suggested that the whole neck would be 2.9 times the size of the humerus, which was , resulting in a long neck based on comparisons with the series of &quot;Nanshiungosaurus&quot;. The most distinctive feature of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was the presence of gigantic unguals on each of the three digits of its hands. These were common among therizinosaurs but particularly large and stiffened in &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, and they are considered as the longest known from any terrestrial animal.

===Forelimbs===

The arm of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; covered in total length (humerus, radius and second metacarpal with phalanges lengths). The measured long with a stocky and flattened dorsal blade, wide acromial process (bony extension) and a very widened ventral surface. Near the anterior edge of the scapular widening and near the suture (bone joint), a foramen was located; it likely functioned as a channel for blood vessels and nerves. The posterior edge of the scapula was robust and the was lightly built, likely fused into a cartilaginous system with its periphery in life. The measured in length, it had a broad and convex lateral surface that formed a slightly inclined concavity near of the scapulocoracoid suture. This concavity bent down towards the scapular widening. Near the scapulocoracoid suture, this edge turned very thin and possibly into cartilage along with the periphery of the coracoid in life, as the case of the scapular edge. A large foramen was also present on the coracoid. The was broad and deep, slightly pointing to the outer lateral side. It had robust and convex crest-like borders. The supraglenoid thickness was developed in a convex crest-shaped form, it was divided across the top of the scapulocoracoid suture. The attachment for the biceps muscle was prominently developed by a large tubercle with a stocky top, indicating powerful muscles in life.

The was robustly built, measuring long. It had a broad upper end. The (deltoid muscle attachment) was particularly long and thick, with its top located approximately 1/3 from the upper end. The length of the crest was no less than 2/3 the length of the whole bone element. The lower end of the humerus was very expanded and flared. The condyles were developed onto the anterior side of the lower expansion while the epicondyles were very broad and projected over the limits of the articular areas. The measured and most of its length was occupied by its straight shaft. The ulnar process was very wide. The upper articular area was divided into inner and outer lateral sides. The lateral side had a triangular-shaped border and was slightly concave; it was limited in a top view by the depression for the upper articulation of the radius. The inner side formed a semilunar-shaped depression that covered the lunar-shaped condyle of the humerus. The was long and slightly S-curved. Its upper end was flattened in a lateral direction, very wide, and the distal end was highly robust.
The first lower measured tall and wide and had two articulation surfaces on its lowermost end. The upper surface of this carpal was divided by a broad depression that formed the articulation of the carpus. On its inner side, it had a triangular-shaped outline that attached to the upper surface of metacarpal I, occupying a little bit less than the lateral side, which articulates to metacarpal II. These areas were separated by an oblique bony projection. The second lower carpal was smaller than the first one, measuring tall and wide. Its lower surface was flattened and the articular surface of the carpus extended from the first carpal to the second carpal over the articulation of the two bones.

The I was long and compared to the others it was more stockier. Its lateral side was broad, especially on the uppermost area; the inner border was thin and narrow. The upper articulation was configured into three parts. The lower articular surface was somewhat asymmetric and bent to the inner side from the left one, along with a wide and deep opening. The total length of this metacarpal was larger than 2/3 the length of metacarpal III, which may have been a unique trait of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. The metacarpal II measured in length and was the most elongated and robust metacarpal. It had an inclined, square-shaped, and flattened upper articulation. The articulation on the lower head had very symmetrical condyles, being divided by a broad, deep depression. The lateral connecting openings were poorly developed. The metacarpal III covered in length and had a very thin shaft compared to the other metacarpals. Its upper articulation was divided into three parts. The lower articular head was asymmetrical with deep and broad openings. As in metacarpal II, the lateral connecting openings were poorly developed.

Only the second of the manus is known in &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. It consisted of two and a large . The first and second phalanges were somewhat equal in shape and length ( and , respectively), and shared the robust and stocky structure. The upper articular facets were very symmetrical and had a crest—particularly taller in the first phalanx. The top border of this crest was very pointed and thick; it likely served as the site for attachment of the extensor tendons in life. The lower heads were nearly symmetrical, but the central depression was considerably wider and deeper in the first phalanx. The manual unguals of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; were especially enormous and long, estimated to have covered approximately in length. Unlike other therizinosaurs they were very straight, side to side flattened, and had sharp curvatures only at the tips, a unique feature of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust, indicating a large pad in life. The articulation surface that connected the preceding phalanx was slightly concave and divided into two by a central ridge.

===Hindlimbs===

&quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; had a rather stocky and robust that was very wide on its lower end. The was robust and short (almost sauropodomorph-like), and composed of five . The first four were functional and terminated in weight-bearing digits, hence having a tetradactyl (four-toed) condition. The last or fifth metatarsal was highly reduced bone located at the lateral side of the metatarsus and had no functional significance. Unlike most other theropods groups, the first pedal digit was—though shorter than the others—functional and weight-bearing. The second and third were equally long while the fourth was smaller and somewhat thinner. The pedal unguals were side to side flattened and likely sharp. The morphology of the feet of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and other therizinosaurids was unique, as the general theropod formula includes tridactyl (three-toed) feet in which the first toe was reduced to a dewclaw and held off the ground.

==Classification==
Maleev originally classified &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; as a giant marine turtle and the genus was assigned by him to a separate family, Therizinosauridae given how enigmatic the specimen was. The fossils remained with uncertainty among the scientific community; however, in 1970 Rozhdestvensky was one of the first paleontologists to suggest that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was actually a theropod dinosaur instead of a turtle. He also suggested that the supposed ribs of the holotype were likely from a different dinosaur, possibly a sauropodomorph. In 1976 Barsbold concluded that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a theropod because MPC-D 100/15 matched numerous theropodan characters, and that Therizinosauridae and Deinocheiridae were probably synonyms. With the discovery and description of &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;, in 1979 Perle named a new family of dinosaurs, the &quot;Segnosauridae&quot;. He tentatively placed the family within Theropoda given the similarities of the mandible and dentition to other members. A year later, the new genus &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; was named by Barsbold and Perle in 1980. They named a new infraorder called the Segnosauria, composed of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. They also noted that while aberrant and having ornithischian-like pelves, segnosaurs featured similar traits to other theropods. With the discovery of the referred hindlimb to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; in 1982 by Perle, he concluded that &quot;Segnosaurus&quot; was very similar to the latter based on the morphology and they possibly belonged to a single, if not the same, group. In 1983, Barsbold named a new genus of segnosaur, &quot;Enigmosaurus&quot;. He analyzed the pelvis of the new genus and pointed out that segnosaurids were so different from other theropods that they could be outside the group or represent a different lineage of theropod dinosaurs. Later on the same year, he intensified the exclusion of segnosaurs from being theropods by noting that their pelves resembled those of sauropod dinosaurs.

Consequently, the assignment of segnosaurs started to shift towards sauropodomorphs. In 1984, Gregory S. Paul claimed that segnosaurs, rather than being theropods, were indeed sauropodomorphs that successfully managed to remain in the Cretaceous period. He based the idea on anatomical traits such as the skull and similar configuration. He maintained his position in 1988 by placing the Segnosauria into the now obsolete Phytodinosauria, and was one of the first to suggest a segnosaur assignment for the enigmatic &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. Other prominent paleontologists like Jacques Gauthier or Paul Sereno supported this vision. In 1990, Barsbold and Teresa Maryanska agreed in that the hindlimb material from Hermiin Tsav referred to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; in 1982 was segnosaurian since it matched several traits, but considered it unlikely to belong to the genus and species as there was no overlapping material among specimens. Barsbold and Maryanska also disagreed with previous researchers who classified &quot;Deinocheirus&quot; as a segnosaur. In the same year, David B. Norman considered &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; to be a theropod of uncertain classification.

However, with the unexpected discovery and description of &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; in 1993, the widely accepted sauropodomorph affinities of segnosaurs were questioned by paleontologists Dale Russell and Dong Zhiming. This new genus was far more complete than any other segnosaur and multiple anatomical features indicated that it was related to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. With this, they identified the Therizinosauridae along with the Segnosauridae to be the same group, the former name having taxonomic priority. Due to some primitive characters present in &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; they coined a new taxonomic rank, the Therizinosauroidea, containing the new taxon and Therizinosauridae. All of the new information provided data on the affinities of the new-named therizinosauroids. Russell and Dong concluded that they were theropods with unusual features. In 1994, Clark and colleagues redescribed the very complete skull of &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and even more theropod traits were found this time. They also validated the synonymy of the Segnosauridae with Therizinosauridae and considered therizinosauroids as maniraptoran dinosaurs. In 1997, Rusell coined the infraorder Therizinosauria in order to contain all segnosaurs. This new infraorder was composed of Therizinosauroidea and the more advanced Therizinosauridae. Consequently, Segnosauria became a synonym of Therizinosauria. Though some uncertainties remained, a small and feathered therizinosauroid from China was described in 1999 by Xu Xing and colleagues: the new genus &quot;Beipiaosaurus&quot;. It confirmed the placement of therizinosaurs among theropods and also their taxonomic place on the Coelurosauria. The discovery also indicated that feathers were highly distributed among theropod dinosaurs.

In 2010, Lindsay Zanno revised the taxonomy of therizinosaurs in extensive detail. She found that many parts on therizinosaur holotype and referred specimens were lost or damaged, and sparse specimens with no overlapping elements were disadvantages when concluding the relationships of the members. Zanno accepted the referral of the specimen IGM 100/45 to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; since it matches multiple therizinosaurid traits, but decided not to include the specimen in her taxonomic analysis due to the lack of comparative forelimb remains. She also excluded the supposed ribs that were present on the holotype since they likely came from a different animal and not &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. In 2019, Hartman and colleagues also performed a large phylogenetic analysis of Therizinosauria based on the characters provided by Zanno in her revision. They found similar results to Zanno regarding the family Therizinosauridae but this time with the inclusion of more taxa and specimens. The cladogram below shows the placement of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; within Therizinosauria according to Hartman and colleagues in 2019:

==Paleobiology==
===Feeding===
In 1993 Dale A. Russell and Donald E. Russell analyzed &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Chalicotherium,&quot; and noted similarities in their respective body plan, even though they form part of different groups. Both genera had large, well-developed, and relatively strong arms; the pelvic girdle was robust and suited for a sitting behavior; and the hindlimb (particularly the foot) structure was robust and shortened. They considered these adaptations to represent an example of convergent evolution—a condition where organisms evolve similar traits without necessarily being related—between extinct mammal and dinosaur genera. Moreover, the body plan is somewhat exhibited by the modern-day gorillas. Because the animals with this type of body plan are known to represent herbivores, the authors suggested this lifestyle for &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. Russell and Russell reconstructed the feeding behavior of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; as being able to sit while consuming foliage from large shrubs and trees. The plant material would have been harvested with its hands and this action was likely favored by its elongated neck which prevented the use of large amounts of force and effort. As its arms were long enough to have touched the ground during certain stances, they could have helped the dinosaur to rise from a prone position. If browsing in a bipedal stance, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; may have been able to reach even higher vegetation supported by its short and robust feet. Whereas &quot;Chalicotherium&quot; was more suited to hook branches, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was better at pushing large clumps of foliage because of its long claws. It is also possible that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was less capable of great precision in its movements than was &quot;Chalicotherium&quot;, due to the latter having more developed brain, dental and muscular capacities.

Anthony R. Fiorillo and colleagues in 2018 suggested that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; had a reduced bite force that may have been useful for cropping vegetation or foraging, based on relative therizinosaurids such as &quot;Erlikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Segnosaurus&quot;. As the bite force started to decrease from primitive to derived therizinosaurians, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, being a derived member, would have been subject to the evolutionary relationship.

===Arms and claws function===

When the genus was first described by Maleev in 1954, he considered that the unusually large claws were used to harvest seaweed. This was however, based on the assumption of a giant marine turtle. In 1970, Rozhdestvensky re-examined the claws and suggested a possible function specialized in opening termite mounds or a frugivore diet. Barsbold in 1976 suggested that the unusual claws of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; may have been employed to impale or dig up loose terrain, however, he pointed out their notorious fragility upon impact. In 1995, Lev A. Nessov suggested the elongated claws were used for defense against predators and juveniles could have used their claws for arboreal locomotion, in a similar way to the modern-day sloths or hoatzin chicks.

In 2014, Lautenschlager tested the function of various therizinosaur hand claws—including &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;—through digital simulations. Three different functional scenarios were simulated for each claw morphology with a force of 400 N applied in each scenario: scratch/digging; hook-and-pull; and piercing. Though the stocky claws of &quot;Alxasaurus&quot; resulted in low-stress magnitudes, the stress was greater with the curvature and elongation of the claws in &quot;Falcarius&quot;, &quot;Nothronychus&quot; and &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. Some of the highest stress, deformation, and strain magnitudes were obtained in the scratch/digging scenario, the hook-and-pull scenario, in contrast, resulted in lower magnitudes, and lesser ones were found in the piercing scenario. Particularly, the overall stress was most pronounced in the unusual claws of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, which may represent an exceptional case of elongation specialization. Lautenschlager noted the more strongly curved and elongate claws of some therizinosaurian taxa were poorly functional in a scratch/digging fashion, indicating this as the most unlikely function. Though fossorial (digging) behavior has been reported in several dinosaur species, the large body size largely rules out the possibility of burrow digging in therizinosaurs. Nevertheless, an overall digging action would have been done with the foot claws because, since as in other maniraptorans, feathers on the arms would have interfered with this function. Instead of being used for fossorial behavior, it is more likely that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; make use of its hands in a hook-and-pull fashion to pull or grasp vegetation within reach. This herbivorous behavior would make therizinosaurs mostly similar to the extant anteaters and the extinct ground sloths. Lautenschlager could neither confirm nor disregard that the hand claws could have been used for defense, intraspecific competition, stabilization by grasping tree trunks during high browsing, sexual dimorphism, or gripping mates during mating given the lack of more specimens. He clarified that there is no evidence that the long claws of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; would have been used in active defense or attack, however, it is possible that these appendages could have had some role when facing a threat, such as intimidation. 

Scott A. Lee and Zachary Richards in 2018 based on bending resistance measurements of several dinosaur humeri, found the humeri of carnosaur, therizinosaur, and tyrannosaur dinosaurs to be relatively resilient to stress. This increased ability to withstand stress supports the idea that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and other therizinosaurians used their arms in a robust fashion that generated significant forces. They also suggested that the prominent claws of some members could have been used as a defense against predators and other various functions. Unlike the generally light and agile ornithomimosaurs who avoided predation with speed, &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; and relatives relied on arms and claws to face threats (and were generally slow-runners to begin with).

A 2023 study by Qin, Rayfield, Benton &quot;et al.,&quot; regarding the claw function in therizinosaurids and alvarezsaurids, which represent the extremes of theropod claw morphology, suggest that there was no mechanical function identifiable for &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, suggesting the claws on its forelimbs were merely decorative rather than functional and a result of peramorphic growth resulting from increased body size.

==Paleoenvironment==

The remains of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; have been found in the well-known Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert. Although this formation has never been dated radiometrically because of the discontinuity of exposures and absence of datable volcanic rock facies, the vertebrate fossil assemblage suggests an early Maastrichtian stage possibly about 70 million years ago. The Nemegt Formation is separated into three informal members. The lower member is mainly composed by fluvial sediments, while middle and upper members consist of alluvial plain, paludal, lacustrine, and fluvial sedimentation.

The environments that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; inhabited have been determined by the sedimentation across the formation, the δ13C level preserved on the tooth enamel of many herbivorous dinosaurs and the numerous petrified wood across the formation. They consisted of large meandering and braided rivers with extensive woodlands composed of large, enclosed, canopy-like forests of Araucarias that supported diverse herbivorous dinosaurs like &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. The climate of the formation was relatively temperate (mean annual temperatures between 7.6 and 8.7 °C), characterized by monsoons with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers with the addition of mean annual precipitations between 775 mmm and 835 mmm, a precipitation that was subject to prominent seasonal fluctuations. The wet environments of the Nemegt Formation may have acted as an oasis-like area that attracted oviraptorids from arid neighbour localities such as the Barun Goyot Formation, as evidenced on the presence of &quot;Nemegtomaia&quot; in both regions. It has been previously suggested that the Nemegt Formation may have been similar to the modern-day Okavango Delta, which is also composed of mesic (well-watered) surroundings.

The paleofauna of the Nemegt Formation was diverse and rich, composed of other dinosaurs such as the alvarezsaurs &quot;Mononykus&quot; and &quot;Nemegtonykus&quot;; deinonychosaurs &quot;Adasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Zanabazar&quot;; ornithomimosaurs &quot;Anserimimus&quot; and &quot;Gallimimus&quot;; oviraptorosaurs &quot;Avimimus&quot;, &quot;Gigantoraptor&quot;, &quot;Rinchenia&quot; and &quot;Elmisaurus&quot;; tyrannosaurids &quot;Alectrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Alioramus&quot; and possibly &quot;Bagaraatan&quot;; ankylosaurids &quot;Saichania&quot; and &quot;Tarchia&quot;; and pachycephalosaurids &quot;Homalocephale&quot; and &quot;Prenocephale&quot;. The Nemegt megafauna included the ornithomimosaur &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;; hadrosaurids &quot;Barsboldia&quot; and &quot;Saurolophus&quot;; titanosaurs &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;; and the apex predator &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. Additional paleofauna includes birds like &quot;Judinornis&quot; or &quot;Teviornis&quot;; abundant freshwater ostracods at numerous localities; fish; terrestrial and aquatic turtles such as &quot;Mongolochelys&quot; and &quot;Nemegtemys&quot;; and the crocodylomorph &quot;Paralligator&quot;.

As the sediments in which &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; remains have been found are fluvial-based, it is suggested that it may have preferred to forage on riparian areas. &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; due to its prominent height and high-browsing lifestyle, was one of the tallest dinosaurs in the Nemegt Formation paleofauna. It probably had no significant competition with other herbivores over the foliage, however, a niche partitioning with the titanosaurs—also long-necked dinosaurs—of the formation could have occurred. If &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; was a grazer, on the other hand, it would have competed with contemporary grazers such as &quot;Saurolophus&quot;. Although small predators like dromaeosaurids and troodontids did not represent a threat to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, the only other predator rivaling in size was &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot;. Because of the greater height of &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;, a large &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; may have been not able to bite any higher than the thighs or belly of an adult standing &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. The elongated claws may have been useful for self-defense or to intimidate the predator during this situation. It is also possible that &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot; competed for other various resources with &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;, &quot;Saurolophus&quot;, &quot;Nemegtosaurus&quot; and &quot;Opisthocoelicaudia&quot;.

<text>The Alberford was an English car manufactured in about 1922 to 1924 in Albert Bridge Garage, Chelsea, London. Marketed as &quot;the ideal owner-driver car&quot; it was based on a lengthened and possibly lowered chassis from a Model T Ford with wire wheels and a Rolls-Royce type radiator. The engine was converted to overhead valve and a top speed of 75 mph (120 km/h) was claimed. Prices ranged from £253 for a two-seater to £500 for a saloon.

<doc id="851592" wikidata="Q2685594" url="?curid=851592" title="Queenstown Road railway station">
<text>Queenstown Road is a railway station in inner south-west London, south-west of , between and . It is a short walk from Battersea Park station and Battersea Park to the west. It has three platforms, two of which are in use by all stopping services related to the Waterloo to Reading Line: its branch services to Weybridge (via Hounslow) and two separate sets of bidirectional Waterloo-to-Waterloo services via Hounslow using the Hounslow Loop and via Kingston using the Kingston Loop. In addition, 50% of maximum peak hour trains serving the Shepperton branch line call at the station.

==History==
The station was opened on 1 November 1877, by the London and South Western Railway, as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Road (Battersea)&quot;. The entrance still bears the name Queen&#x27;s Road, not to be confused with Queens Road Peckham, Walthamstow Queen&#x27;s Road or Queensway Underground station, which was also originally called Queens Road.

Queen&#x27;s Road was also the name of the road in which the station is located. Named after Queen Victoria, after the Second World War the street&#x27;s name was changed to Queenstown Road. The station was renamed &quot;Queenstown Road (Battersea)&quot;, to go with the road, on 12 May 1980. The station&#x27;s modern entrance and platform signage lacks the &quot;(Battersea)&quot; suffix that appears in timetables and on some maps. The latest &quot;Oyster Rail Services&quot; map produced by Transport for London shows the station as plain &quot;Queenstown Road&quot;. On the map produced by the station managers, South Western Railway, the station is called &quot;Queenstown Road&quot;.

The station is Grade II listed.

== Services ==
Queenstown Road is close to the terminus of the South West Main Line but with only 2 platforms in use. The off-peak frequency in trains per hour is:
*Northbound:
**4 to London Waterloo
*Southbound:
**2 to Weybridge via Hounslow and Staines
**2 on the Kingston Loop (anti-clockwise) via Richmond and Kingston, back to London Waterloo

==Connections==
London Buses routes 137, 156, 452 and night route N137 serve the station.

==Future==
Network Rail plans to reopen Platform 1 at Queenstown Road to permit the segregation of Windsor and Mainline services flows, providing additional capacity on the approach to London Waterloo.

<doc id="851594" wikidata="Q738015" url="?curid=851594" title="Helsinki Cathedral">
<text>Helsinki Cathedral (, ; , ) is the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran cathedral of the Diocese of Helsinki, located in the neighborhood of Kruununhaka in the centre of Helsinki, Finland, at the Senate Square. The church was originally built from 1830 to 1852 as a tribute to the Grand Duke of Finland, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. It was also known as St Nicholas&#x27;s Church (, ) until Finland declared its full independence in 1917. It is a major landmark of the city, and one of the most famous historical structures in Finland as a whole when viewed globally.

==Description==
A distinctive landmark in the Helsinki cityscape, with its tall, green dome surrounded by four smaller domes, the building is in the neoclassical style. It was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel as the climax of his Senate Square layout: it is surrounded by other, smaller buildings designed by him.

The church&#x27;s plan is a Greek cross (a square centre and four equilateral arms), symmetrical in each of the four cardinal directions, with each arm&#x27;s facade featuring a colonnade and pediment. Engel originally intended to place a further row of columns on the western end to mark the main entrance opposite the eastern altar, but this was never built.

==History==
After Helsinki was made into the capital of Finland in 1812, Alexander I decreed in 1814 that 15 percent of the salt import tax were to be collected into a fund for two churches, one Lutheran and one Orthodox. The cathedral was built on the site of the smaller 1724–1727 , which had been dedicated to its patroness, Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden. Helsinki Old Church was built between 1824 and 1826 in nearby Kamppi to serve the parish while the Ulrika Eleonora Church was being demolished and until the consecration of the new cathedral. The bells of the old church were reused in the cathedral. Construction of the cathedral began in 1830, although it was only officially inaugurated on 15 February 1852. Engel died in 1840.

The building was later altered by Engel&#x27;s successor Ernst Lohrmann, whose four small domes emphasise the architectural connection to the cathedral&#x27;s models, Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral and Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg. Lohrmann also designed two extra buildings to the sides of the steps: looking from the square the left building is a bell tower and the right building a chapel. He also erected larger-than-life sized zinc statues of the Twelve Apostles at the apexes and corners of the roofline in 1849. They were sculpted by August Wredov and Hermann Schievelbein and cast by S. P. Devaranne in Berlin in 1845–1847. The altarpiece was painted by Carl Timoleon von Neff and donated to the church by Emperor Nicholas I. The cathedral crypt was renovated in the 1980s by architects Vilhelm Helander and Juha Leiviskä for use in exhibitions and church functions; Helander was also responsible for conservation repairs on the cathedral in the late 1990s.

Today, the cathedral is one of Helsinki&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions. In 2018 there were half a million visitors. The church is in regular use for services of worship and special events such as weddings. Finland&#x27;s national Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day celebrations are held at the cathedral.

==In popular culture==

The opening sequence of the music video for &quot;Sandstorm&quot; by Darude was filmed on Senate Square, prominently featuring the Cathedral in the background.

<doc id="851595" wikidata="Q10352345" url="?curid=851595" title="Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar">
<text>Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar (21 May 1921 – 21 October 1990), also known by his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti (Ánanda Múrti = &quot;Bliss Embodiment&quot;), and known as Bábá (&quot;Father&quot;) to his disciples, was a spiritual guru, philosopher, social reformer, linguist, author and composer of 5,018 songs mostly in the Bengali language. He founded &quot;Ananda Marga&quot; (&quot;the Path of Bliss&quot;) in 1955 as a spiritual and social organisation that continues to offer instruction in meditation and yoga and runs numerous social service and disaster relief projects throughout the world.

Sarkar developed his system of spiritual practice as a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He denounced religious dogmas, casteism, materialism and capitalism, considering all of these as impediments to social harmony, progress and spiritual growth. He described the universe as a manifestation of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature, resulting in creation. His spiritual and social philosophies embraced diversity as the law of nature; a result of Singular Consciousness expressing itself in numerous forms. Sarkar advocated for the welfare of humans and the planet through his socio-economic philosophy of PROUT, which is rooted in the idea of Neohumanism, a worldview based on inter-connectedness of all beings.

==Biography==
Sarkar was born during the full moon of the Indian month of &quot;Vaeshakh&quot; (Buddha Purnima), on 21 May 1921 (at 6:07 in the morning) to Lakshmi Narayan Sarkar, a homoeopathic doctor and Abharani Devi in the small town of Jamalpur, Bihar. His family hailed from Bamunpara (Brahmanpara), Burdwan District in West Bengal.

In 1939, Sarkar left Jamalpur for Kolkata to attend Vidyasagar College of the University of Calcutta. Sarkar had to quit his studies to support his family after the death of his father; from 1944 until the early 1950s, Sarkar worked as an accountant at the Indian railways headquarters in Jamalpur, Bihar. He taught the techniques of Yoga and Tantra meditation to a select number of his colleagues and gradually more people were drawn to the spiritual practices he taught.

In 1955, Sarkar founded &quot;Ananda Marga&quot; (&quot;the Path of Bliss&quot;), a socio-spiritual movement with a two-part mission that Sarkar stated as &quot;self-realization and service to all&quot; with a spiritual practice that synthesized Vedic and Tantric philosophies. Sarkar&#x27;s ideas are collected in the series of books called &quot;Subháśita Samgraha&quot;, which form part of the philosophical scriptures of &quot;Ananda Marga&quot; ideology.

During the latter part of his life, his main residence was in Lake Gardens in Kolkata, West Bengal. He also spent much time, especially early on, in the all-round development community he founded based on his PROUT theory at Anandanagar. Ananda Marga opened regional offices in various countries, including the US in 1969; by 1973, he bad established approximately 100 local centres teaching yogic and social philosophies, with several thousand members, some living communally in the ashrams.

In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges.

In 1979, Sarkar took two world tours to meet disciples in various countries around the world, including Switzerland, Germany, France, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Jamaica and Venezuela. He was barred from entering the US by the State Department, so instead he met his American disciples in Jamaica in 1979. Just before he died on 21 October 1990 from a heart attack, he founded Ananda Marga Gurukula on 7 September 1990, an educational network to preserve and develop his legacy through research, teaching and service.

==Spiritual philosophy==

Sarkar&#x27;s teachings on spiritual philosophy are a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He considered himself to be &quot;an incorrigible optimist&quot; in his thinking.

===Cosmology===
Sarkar described the universe as a result of macropsychic conation – the entire universe exists within the cosmic mind, which itself is the first expression of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature. He described the cosmological flow as being from limitless consciousness to limited consciousness and back to limitless consciousness, attained by meditation.

===Realms of the mind===
According to Sarkar&#x27;s philosophy the individual mind is composed of five layers called &quot;Kosas&quot;:

#&quot;Kamamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;layer of desire&quot;) or &quot;Crude Mind&quot;: is the layer that controls the body. It operates on instinct or passion. This layer is sometimes conscious and sometimes subconscious.
#&quot;Manomaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;layer of thinking&quot;) or &quot;Subtle Mind&quot;: is the layer of thought and memory. This &quot;Kosa&quot; gives experience of pleasure and pain and is developed naturally through physical clash, and in &quot;Ananda Marga sadhana&quot; by &quot;pranayama&quot; with cosmic ideation.
#&quot;Atimanasa Kosa&quot; or &quot;Supramental Mind&quot;: is the intuitive layer. This &quot;Kosa&quot; gives the capacity of intuitive dreams, clairvoyance, telepathy and creative insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in &quot;Ananda Marga sadhana&quot; by methods of &quot;pratyahara&quot; (withdrawal) such as &quot;shuddhis&quot; and &quot;Guru Puja&quot;.
#&quot;Vijinanamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;layer of the special knowledge&quot;) or &quot;Subliminal Mind&quot;: is the layer of conscience or discrimination (&quot;viveka&quot;) and &quot;vaeragya&quot; (non-attachment). This &quot;Kosa&quot; is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of &quot;dharana&quot;.
#&quot;Hiranyamaya Kosa&quot; (&quot;golden level&quot;) or &quot;Subtle Causal Mind&quot;: is the subtlest layer. Here the awareness of mind is very close to the direct experience of &quot;Supreme Consciousness&quot;. Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This &quot;Kosa&quot; is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and &quot;dhyana&quot; accelerates this process for &quot;sadhakas&quot; (spiritual aspirants).

===Biopsychology===
Sarkar&#x27;s &quot;biopsychology&quot; reimagined the traditional &quot;tantric&quot; belief in &quot;chakras&quot; (&quot;wheels&quot;) as being due to interactions of subtle energies through nerve plexuses. He believed this connected the endocrine glands of the neuroendocrine system with a psychic part of the body. The philosophy of &quot;Ananda Marga&quot; considers the human body as composed of the same five &quot;fundamental factors&quot; as the rest of the universe as explained in &quot;Brahmachakra&quot;. Every factor is said to be distributed throughout the body, but governed by a &quot;chakra&quot;, substations of the mind which control their own assigned areas. The biopsychology of &quot;Ananda Marga&quot; expands the concept of the seven basic &quot;chakras&quot; and in general, mainly considers:

#The &quot;Muladhara Chakra&quot;: at the tip of the spine (controls the solid factor).
#The &quot;Svadhisthana Chakra&quot;: at the level of the genitals (controls the liquid factor and is associated with the reproductive glands).
#The &quot;Manipura Chakra&quot;: at the level of the navel (controls the luminous factor and is associated with Pancreas).
#The &quot;Anahata Chakra&quot;: at the center of the chest (controls the aerial factor and is associated with Thymus).
#The &quot;Vishuddha Chakra&quot;: at the throat (controls the ethereal factor and is associated with the Thyroid gland).
#The &quot;Ajina Chakra&quot;: between the eyebrows (associated with the Pituitary gland).
#The &quot;Sahasrara Chakra&quot;: at the crown of the head (associated with the Pineal gland). Mind&#x27;s propensities (&quot;vrttis&quot;) associated with each &quot;Chakra&quot; affect the glands and the hormones secreted from those glands (hence the emotions, physical behaviour and functioning of the various body systems). But the glands and the hormones they secrete may also affect the mind in a chain of feedback.

===Microvita===
&quot;Microvita&quot; is plural for &quot;Microvitum&quot; and literally means &quot;possessing or with micro-life&quot;. He believed that microvita are smaller and subtler than physical atoms and subatomic particles, and in the psychic realm contribute to &quot;pure consciousness&quot;. Sarkar claimed that they would be recognised by conventional science. Sarkar gave the intuitional theory of Microvita in 1986.

=== Sadhana ===
A central point in Sarkar&#x27;s philosophy is the concept of &quot;Sadhana&quot;. He described &quot;Sadhana&quot; as a practice for &quot;the transformation of fearful love into fearless love&quot;. For Sarkar, &quot;Sandhana&quot; was concretized by the practice of meditation. He recommended to his disciples the daily practice of individual meditation and the weekly practice of collective meditation. These weekly meetings of his disciples, called &quot;Dharma Chakras,&quot; are preceded by the collective singing of a few &quot;Prabhat Samgiita&quot; (or &quot;Songs of the New Dawn&quot;, composed by P. R. Sarkar himself) followed by &quot;Baba Nam Kevalam&quot; kiirtan, then the mantra called &quot;Samgacchadvam&quot;. The mantra &quot;Nityam Shuddham&quot; marks the end of the collective meditation, then the spiritual gathering will end with the &quot;Guru Puja&quot; &quot;mantra&quot;.

== Social and political philosophy ==

=== Law of Social Cycle ===
The concept of &quot;Varna&quot; describes four main socio-psychological types, whereby human psychological and physical endowment and social motivations are expressed: the &quot;Vipra&quot; (intellectual), &quot;Kshatriya&quot; (warrior), &quot;Vaishya&quot; (acquisitor) and &quot;Shudra&quot; (labourer). &quot;Varna&quot;, in Sarkar&#x27;s perspective, however is more than just a psychological trait but rather an archetype, approximately to Michel Foucault&#x27;s notion of epistemes, which are broader frameworks of knowledge defining what is true and real. Sarkar clarified that &quot;Varna&quot; is not the same as Hindu idea of &quot;caste&quot;. He was an ardent advocate of building a casteless society, in which everyone gets equal opportunities to fulfil their highest human potential based on their physical, psychological and spiritual strengths. To materialize this, Sarkar propounded Prout.

Sarkar&#x27;s &quot;Law of Social Cycle&quot; applies these traits in a theory of historical evolution, where ages rise and fall in terms of ruling elites representing one of the above-mentioned traits. This &quot;law&quot; possibly connects to the earlier cyclical historical ideas of Sri Aurobindo, with a focus on the psychology of human development, as well as Ibn Khaldun, among other macrohistorians ideas about cycles. However, along with a cyclical dimension—the rise and fall of ages—Sarkar&#x27;s theory exhibits a correspondent linear dimension, in that economic and technological &quot;progress&quot; are considered critical in terms of meeting the changing material conditions of life. Ultimately, for Sarkar, true progress has to prioritise development in the spiritual dimension.

Spirituality for Sarkar is defined as the individual realising the &quot;true self&quot;. In addition to yogic meditational practices and purity of thought and deed, Sarkar attached great importance to selfless social service as a means of liberation. Sarkar considered it necessary for the social arrangements to support the inner development of human beings and rejected both capitalism and communism as appropriate social structures for humanity to move forward to the golden age of a balanced way of life sustaining all-round progress. A serious problem with capitalism was according to Sarkar the concentration of wealth in a few hands and stoppages in the rolling of money which he considered root causes of recessions, even depressions. A spiritual way of life, however, would in no way be divorced from creating structures that help meet the basic, though ever changing, needs—food, housing, clothing, health and education.

Sarkar developed both &quot;Ánanda Márga&quot; and the &quot;Progressive Utilization Theory&quot; as practical means to encourage harmony and co-operation to help society escape this proposed cycle. Sarkar argues that once the social cycle is understood and &quot;sadvipras&quot; evolved, then the periods of exploitation can be largely reduced, if not eliminated. With leadership that is representative of all aspects of the &quot;varnas&quot;—that is, the leader engaged in service, who is courageous, who uses the intellect for the benefits of others, and who has innovative/entrepreneurial skills—the cycle can become an upward spiral.
Sarkar&#x27;s concept of &quot;karma samnyasa&quot; refers to the principle that a yogi becomes a person with all-round development and a balanced mind, that he called a &quot;sadvipra&quot;; and that this is accomplished by someone who remains fixed on the &quot;supreme&quot; consciousness through transformative personal practices and engaging in the politics of social liberation as a form of service work.

=== PROUT: Progressive Utilisation Theory ===

By 1959, Sarkar had developed the socio-economic Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout). In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book &quot;Ananda Sutram&quot;, published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti. In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation &quot;Proutist Block of India&quot; (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action. The PBI was soon superseded by &quot;Proutist Universal&quot; (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).

A Prout economy is cooperative and decentralised. Its focus is collective welfare rather than to profit, without neglecting individuals and their merits. &quot;Progressive utilization&quot; refers to the optimising the use of natural, industrial and human resources on a sustainable basis for the entire ecosystem. The theory claims to overcome the limitations of both capitalism and communism. It is inline with Sarkar&#x27;s social theory of the Law of Social Cycle. The theory aims to encompass the whole of individual and collective existence for all beings, including physical, educational, social, political, mental, cultural and spiritual.

=== Neohumanism ===
In 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of human society with the introduction of his new theory of Neohumanism. If humanism tends to contemplate only humans in a human-centric view, Neohumanism, according to Sarkar&#x27;s theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to universalism. Sarkar said &quot;When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as &quot;Neohumanism&quot;. This Neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.&quot; Neohumanism is said to prefer existential value over utility value for all living beings.

Sarkar&#x27;s Neohumanism places great emphasis on rationality and encourages what he calls a &quot;protospiritual mentality,&quot; a process of continually recognising each object with which we come in contact, externally or internally, as a manifestation of the Supreme Consciousness (Brahma). According to Sarkar, rationality helps to give rise to devotion, which he consider to be the &quot;highest and most valuable treasure of humanity&quot;. In Sarkar&#x27;s view, Neohumanism leads to the liberation of human intellect from the constraints of imposed dogma and the principle of selfish pleasure and psychic complexes helping to bridge the gap between the inner and outer worlds.

===Culture===
In his series of discourses &quot;Talks on Prout&quot;, given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;customs&quot;. According to Sarkar &quot;culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...&quot; but &quot;...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.&quot;

The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:
==Works==
Although Sarkar spent only seventeen years of his life working full-time for his organisations (1966–1971 and 1978–1990), he left behind a vast legacy, including over 250 books written on a wide variety of topics. Many of this books are compilations or collections of speeches given by him during spiritual or social meetings. He is primarily known as the spiritual teacher behind Ananda Marga, but Sarkar wrote over 1500 pages on his socio-politico-economic Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT), with several thousand more pages dedicated to linguistics and the study of languages; Sarkar&#x27;s writings on linguistics included, among other works, &quot;Shabda Cayanika&quot; (&quot;A Collection of Words&quot;), an unfinished, twenty-six volume dictated encyclopaedia on the Bengali language. Beyond this, he wrote books on sociology, agriculture, history, literature, education, medicine, cosmology, and philosophy, also notably founding the philosophy of Neohumanism in 1982 and the Theory of Microvita in 1986. In his Theory of Microvita, Sarkar &quot;believed that the atoms and the subatomic particles throughout the boundless universe are imbued with life.&quot;

=== Music ===
In 1982 Sarkar started composing songs. In eight years, until the date of his death, He completed the composition of 5018 songs in multiple languages. His collection of songs is called Prabhat Samgiita (&quot;Songs of the New Dawn&quot;).

<text>A dress code is a set of rules, often written, with regard to what clothing groups of people must wear. Dress codes are created out of social perceptions and norms, and vary based on purpose, circumstances, and occasions. Different societies and cultures are likely to have different dress codes, Western dress codes being a prominent example.

Dress codes are symbolic indications of different social ideas, including social class, cultural identity, attitude towards comfort, tradition, and political or religious affiliations. Dress code also allows individuals to read others&#x27; behavior as good, or bad by the way they express themselves with their choice of apparel.

==History==

===Europe===

From the seventh through the ninth centuries, the European royalty and nobility used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other people. All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, jackets, pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as James Planché states, &quot;gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles&quot;. The nobility tended to wear longer tunics than the lower social classes.

While dress codes of modern-day Europeans are less strict, there are some exceptions. It is possible to ban certain types of clothing in the workplace, as exemplified by the European Court of Justice’s verdict that &quot;a ban on Islamic headscarves at work can be lawful.&quot;

===The Americas===
The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast had a complex social hierarchy that consisted of slaves, commoners, and nobles, with dress codes indicating these social distinctions. John R. Jewitt, an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nuu-chah-nulth people in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, Maquinna and the chiefs decided that he must now be &quot;considered one of them, and conform to their customs&quot;. Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.

In the early 20th century, informal wear was the norm across many social settings, including workplaces, restaurants, travel, and movie theaters. In the 1950s, casual wear became prominent in many of these settings, but informal wear remained dominant in workplaces and churches. Beginning in the 1980s, technology companies in Silicon Valley developed the business casual dress code, which was part of a broader organizational culture of emphasizing efficiency over propriety. Today, casual wear is the norm in the tech industry, exemplified by tech executives such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg.

In North American high schools, fashion for girls began to be more revealing in the late twentieth century, including clothing such as low-rise jeans, revealing tops, miniskirts, and spaghetti straps. With these new styles appearing in schools, dress codes have in some cases become more rigorous as a result.

The dress codes in North American high schools typically resulted in tests that would determine if skirts or shorts were long enough. A common test would be used to measure the appropriate length of students&#x27; shorts/skirts. If a student&#x27;s fingers extended past their clothing, then the clothing was considered a violation of the school dress code.

=== Muslim world ===

Islam, founded in the seventh century CE, laid out rules regarding the attire of both men and women in public. Gold adornments and silk clothes are prohibited for men to wear, as they are luxurious, but they are permissible for women. Men are also required to wear the &quot;ihram&quot; clothing while on Hajj, or annual pilgrimage to Mecca.

&quot;Hijab&quot; generally refers to various head coverings conventionally worn by some Muslim women, most often a headscarf wrapped around the head, covering the hair, neck and ears, but leaving the face visible. The use of the hijab has been on the rise worldwide since the 1970s and is viewed by many Muslims as expressing modesty and faith. There is a consensus among Islamic religious scholars that covering the head is either required or preferred, though some Muslim scholars and activists argue that it is not mandated.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
Sikhism, which was founded in the Indian subcontinent around the end of the fifteenth century, also requires a dress code.

Male Sikhs, who are members of the Khalsa are required to wear a turban at all times. Some, but not all, male Sikhs in North America wear a turban; they will instead tie their hair in a knot or ponytail.

==Laws and social norms==

Cultural values, norms, and laws regarding clothing can vary by location.

For example, the degree of nudity that is acceptable changes depending on location. In New Guinea and Vanuatu, there are areas where it is customary for men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public, while women wear string skirts. In remote areas of Bali, women may go topless, which is less common in more Western countries.

Most Western countries have generally no rules regarding specific clothing in most public scenarios, but only have private rules.

In many countries, the tuxedo or dinner jacket and black pants are &quot;not&quot; the norm for formal occasions. Rather, the indigenous costumes are preferred or even dictated, for example the Barong Tagalog for men and Filipiniana for women in the Philippines, the Kilt in Scotland, and Kinte cloth wear in Nigeria.

==Private dress codes==

Many places have their own private dress code; these organizations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations, such as for weddings, funerals, religious gatherings, etc.

=== Workplace ===
Employees are sometimes required to wear a uniform or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit and tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (See also International standard business attire)

In Western countries, these policies vary depending on the industry. Lawyers, bankers, and executives often wearing a suit and tie, with black shoes and belt, while casual wear is more common in the technology industry. Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical. Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws. So long as the dress code does not favor one gender over the other it is usually acceptable by law for employers to have a private dress code.

In the United States, it is legal for employers to require women to wear makeup and ban men from wearing it. It has been argued that such a distinction in a dress code is not discriminatory because both sexes have rules about their appearance. An important court case that occurred in the U.S was the &quot;Jespersen v. Harrah&#x27;s Operating Co.&quot;, which allowed for a workplace to require that female employees wear makeup while their male counterparts were banned from doing so. Darlene Jespersen worked at Harrah&#x27;s Casino for more than 20 years and found that the makeup and dress code was not only unattainable but degrading. Jespersen found that the &#x27;Personal Best&#x27; policy was not true to her natural appearance as it required a full face of makeup including foundation, powder, blush, mascara, and lipstick. Jespersen stated that this policy &quot;forced her to be ... &#x27;dolled up&#x27; like a sexual object, and ... took away her credibility as an individual and as a person.&quot; In opposition men who worked at Harrah&#x27;s Casino were banned from wearing makeup, nail polish, and other traditionally female attires. Judge Kozinski argued that hyperfemininity was a burden that only women employees suffered. Kozinski stated that the time, effort and expense was more of a hindrance than just being banned from wearing makeup. However despite these efforts, in the ruling, it was decided that women did not have a larger burden in the requirements of the dress code but two judges disagreed and argued that makeup takes more time and money and that sex stereotyping occurred because women&#x27;s bare faces were seen as less desirable.

====New Jersey BorgataBabes case====

In New Jersey, twenty-one women sued the Borgata Casino Hotel &amp; Spa for requiring them to lose weight and stay under a certain size to maintain their jobs. The women argued that the management would ridicule them over weight gain even if they were pregnant. The case was dismissed in New Jersey because the BorgataBabes program required that both men and women maintain certain body shapes and sizes. The &quot;BorgataBabes contractually agreed to adhere to these strict personal appearance and conduct standards&quot;. In 2016, Superior Court Judge Nelson Johnson dismissed the claims because the appearance standards were lawful. He also determined that the women could return to court for their claims of a hostile environment created by the management.

====&quot;Doe v. Boeing Corporation&quot; (1993)====

Doe, a transgender person beginning gender transition, found that her supervisors at the engineering company, Boeing Corporation, were uncooperative with her desire to wear feminine presenting clothing to work. She was warned against wearing, &quot;obviously feminine clothing such as dresses, skirts, or frilly blouses&quot; and from using the women&#x27;s bathroom. This was even after her counselor recommended that wearing female presenting clothing would help with her transition. After a few warnings from her supervisors, Doe showed up to work wearing a pink pantsuit and was subsequently fired for violating the dress code. This prompted Doe to legal action. The Washington State Supreme Court ultimately upheld the decision made by Boeing and stated that the company had the right to determine what female identity looked like while at work.

====&quot;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. R.G. &amp;. G.R Harris Funeral Homes, Inc.&quot;====

Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman, worked at the R.G. &amp;. G.R Harris Funeral Homes and originally was dressing as a stereotypical male following the funeral home&#x27;s male attire, but Stephens had intended to transition to female attire to better suit her gender identity. Thomas Rost, the owner of the funeral home, fired Stephens for not presenting herself as a man and for dressing like a woman. Stephens opened a case at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, stating discrimination based on sex and gender but the district court sided with the funeral home stating, &quot;that transgender status is not a protected trait under Title VII&quot;. In the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, it was ruled that Stephens was unlawfully fired based on sex discrimination, which does protect transgender people. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2020 against firing someone for being homosexual or transgender, as being discrimination based on sex.

====&quot;The CROWN Act&quot;====

The CROWN act, standing for &#x27;create a respectful and open world for natural hair&#x27; is a California law that prohibits discrimination in the school and workplace based on the style or texture of one&#x27;s hair. The act was created in 2019 by Dove and the CROWN Coalition in partnership with California&#x27;s State Senator Holly J. Mitchel. After a study conducted by Dove to reveal the degree of workplace discrimination towards black women, the data was used to spread awareness and elicit change for the act to be passed. CROWN continues to fight for this cause, with a recent work-study conducted in 2023 revealing that discrimination regarding hair texture still prevails. As of June 2023, 23 US states have enacted the CROWN act into law. 

=== Formal wear ===

In Western countries, a &quot;formal&quot; dress code typically means coats for men and evening dresses for women. The most-formal dress code is a full-length ball or evening gowns with evening gloves for women and for men white tie, which also includes a tailcoat.

&quot;Semi-formal&quot; has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as black tie) and a dress for women. A frilled or patterned white shirt is considered more formal than a plain white or black shirt, and a black bow tie is considered more formal than a plain black cravat, but all could be considered appropriate, depending upon the gala or wedding, when white, black, and blue were the only acceptable colors for weddings and gala events in the 20th century.

&quot;Business casual&quot; typically means not wearing neckties or suits, but wearing instead collared shirts, and trousers (not black, but more &quot;relaxed&quot;, including things such as corduroy).

&quot;Casual&quot; typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes.

&quot;Wedding Casual&quot; defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. Weddings in the 21st century tend to attract more colorful clothing than traditionally in the past. Ethnically appropriate costumes, such as a kilt, turban, Barong tagalog, sari, or kinte cloth are also worn frequently.

=== Business casual ===

&quot;Business casual&quot; dress is a popular workplace dress code that emerged in white-collar workplaces in Western countries in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many information technology businesses in Silicon Valley were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as suits and neckties (the international standard business attire), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.

The job search engine Monster.com offers this definition, &quot;In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.&quot; A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue jeans and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.

===Unwritten rules===

Because dress codes are frequently unwritten and unspoken, some neurodivergent people have difficulty understanding, finding, shopping for, and dressing appropriately to the codes of special events.

==Education system ==

Many schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment.

=== United States education ===
In 1996, former U.S. President Bill Clinton announced his support for the idea of school uniforms by stating, &quot;School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.&quot; Many school districts in the United States took up the idea. In all 70 schools, comprising around 60,000 students, switched to school uniforms.

School uniforms have been used with several schools to teach students how to dress appropriately, and in cases it has worked, and has decreased distractions in the educational systems. School uniforms also have several other purposes: they are used to create conformity to social norms, increase school spirit, reduce peer bullying, and prevent discrimination based upon socioeconomic class.

One common criticism of school dress codes in the U.S. is that they infringe on students&#x27; right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot;, which involved students wearing black armbands to protest the Vietnam war.

Within the educational system, the Federation supports professional dress code standards for all teachers.

====Dress code violations====
&quot;Communicative&quot; dress code violations are violations where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc. In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by non-communicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on gender. Amongst the transgender populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet pass.

Violation of dress codes have become a subject of school protests, such as at a high school in Toronto, which had a protest after a student was disciplined for wearing a crop top. Students at multiple schools have protested gender discrimination in the application of dress codes.

==== Dress code backlash ====
Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America have been accused of perpetuating sexist standards. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois, protested their school&#x27;s dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was &quot;too distracting for boys.&quot; Thirteen-year-old student Sophie Hasty was quoted in the &quot;Evanston Review&quot; saying that &quot;not being able to wear leggings because it&#x27;s &#x27;too distracting for boys&#x27; is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.&quot; In a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are &quot;walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.&quot;

School dress codes seem to also be gender-biased towards young girls. The research article, &quot;Objectification Study on High School Girls&quot; conducted interviews with middle school girls, one of them describing, &quot;If they&#x27;re [boys] wearing a sleeveless basketball jersey, it doesn&#x27;t fully cover their shoulders. They don&#x27;t usually get called out for that. Guys are not the ones that they&#x27;re looking out for. So they dress code girls, so guys don&#x27;t get distracted. But they don&#x27;t think that girls are going to get distracted by guys&#x27; shoulders.&quot; 

On Monday, September 22, 2014, &quot;about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah&quot; after more than a dozen girls were turned away from a homecoming dance for wearing dresses which violated the dress code. &quot;School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules.&quot; It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts.

In August 2021, one student&#x27;s mother criticized her daughter&#x27;s school for continuing to enforce clothing restrictions on girls while allowing students to opt out of mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There have been several issues with dress code backlash happening to several students, such as a 15-year-old girl who attended Edmonton High school, she was banned from attending her school due to dying her hair blue, this resulted in the girl suing her principal for discrimination. In another case, a 16-year-old girl was sent home because she refused to take her eyebrow ring out.

=== Canadian education ===

==== Dress code backlash ====
A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school&#x27;s assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy &quot;will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control.&quot; She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.

In Ontario, Canada, there were a few backlash incidents that occurred which consisted of girls being sent home due to wearing shorts that were too short. The other case happened in British Columbia where students were directed to wear clothes that were in good taste, and clothing that displayed a business look. Another case that took place in British Columbia was a young women got sent home from her high school, because her principal stated that her shirt was inappropriate due to the show of too much cleavage. These are a few of the many cases that have resulted in a backlash against dress codes.

<doc id="851614" wikidata="Q3547715" url="?curid=851614" title="Udanavarga">
<text>The Udānavarga is an early Buddhist collection of topically organized chapters () of aphoristic verses or &quot;utterances&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;udāna&quot;) attributed to the Buddha and his disciples. While not part of the Pali Canon, the &quot;Udānavarga&quot; has many chapter titles, verses and an overall format similar to those found in the Pali Canon&#x27;s Dhammapada and &quot;Udāna&quot;. At this time, there exist one Sanskrit recension, two Chinese recensions and two or three Tibetan recensions of the &quot;Udānavarga&quot;.

== Content ==
The &quot;Udānavarga&quot; has around 1100 verses in 33 chapters. The chapter titles are:
# Anityavarga
# Kāmavarga
# Tṛṣṇāvarga
# Apramādavarga
# Priyavarga
# Śīlavarga
# Sucaritavarga
# Vācavarga
# Karmavarga
# Śraddhāvargas
# Śramaṇavarga
# Mārgavarga
# Satkāravarga
# Drohavarga
# Smṛtivarga
# Prakirṇakavarga
# Udakavarga
# Puṣpavarga
# Aśvavarga
# Krodhavarga
# Tathāgatavarga
# Śrutavarga
# Ātmavarga
# Peyālavarga
# Mitravarga
# Nirvāṇavarga
# Paśyavarga
# Pāpavarga
# Yugavarga
# Sukhavarga
# Cittavarga
# Bhikṣuvarga
# Brāhmaṇavarga

Comparatively, the most common version of the Dhammapada, in Pali, has 423 verses in 26 chapters. Comparing the &quot;Udānavarga&quot;, Pali Dhammapada and the Gandhari Dharmapada, Brough (2001) identifies that the texts have in common 330 to 340 verses, 16 chapter headings and an underlying structure.

== History ==
The &quot;Udānavarga&quot; is attributed by Brough to the Sarvāstivādins.

Hinüber suggests that a text similar to the Pali Canon&#x27;s &quot;Udāna&quot; formed the original core of the Sanskrit &quot;Udānavarga&quot;, to which verses from the Dhammapada were added. Brough allows for the hypothesis that the &quot;Udānavarga&quot;, the Pali Dhammapada and the Gandhari Dharmapada all have a &quot;common ancestor&quot; but underlines that there is no evidence that any one of these three texts might have been the &quot;primitive Dharmapada&quot; from which the other two evolved.

The Tibetan Buddhist and Chinese Buddhist canons&#x27; recensions are traditionally said to have been compiled by Dharmatrāta.

<doc id="851627" wikidata="Q13497" url="?curid=851627" title="Swiss cuisine">
<text>Swiss cuisine (, , , ) is an ensemble of national, regional and local dishes, consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed in Switzerland or assimilated from other cultures, particularly neighboring countries. The diversity and comprehensiveness of Swiss gastronomy reflects the linguistic, cultural and geographical diversity. The climate of Switzerland allows for a large variety of terroirs, and therefore a wide range of indigenous food, from simple cereals to refined products like cheese and wine.

Switzerland is historically an agricultural country, with many regions being isolated from each other by the Alps. Therefore, one of the main characteristics of Swiss cuisine is its simplicity, with many dishes made up of few but hearty ingredients, often of dairy origin. Swiss cuisine evolved dramatically during the last centuries. Probably the most significant changes occurred after colonization of the Americas and the introduction of now-widely-used ingredients such as potatoes, maize and cocoa. The increase in purchasing power and a certain homogenization of taste have allowed the emergence of some emblematic national dishes such as fondue and rösti.

Well-known products exported worldwide include cheese, wine and chocolate. A large number of them are protected by a geographical indication (AOP). A strong food industry, often related to chocolate, has developed over the past centuries in Switzerland.

==Agriculture and foods==

The climatic and cultural diversity of Switzerland is reflected in the diversity of its food products. Various cereals and fruits are cultivated in the lower regions, while the warmest and sunniest areas in the south lend themselves to growing grapes, chestnuts, and even olives. The other most common fruits cultivated in Switzerland are apples, pears, apricots, cherries, plums and strawberries. The mountainous and coldest areas feature the perhaps most emblematic agricultural practices of Switzerland: dairy farming and alpine transhumance.

Swiss cuisine comprises a variety of staple foods. These typically include bread, potatoes, pasta, rice and polenta. Potatoes are particularly ubiquitous in Swiss cuisine, although it is only the case since the late 18th century. They are notably used in rösti, a popular dish that is eaten all over Switzerland, and originally a breakfast food. Bread and cereals are eaten on a daily basis in Switzerland. Muesli, which is commonly eaten for breakfast goes by the name of &quot;Birchermüesli&quot; (&quot;Birchermiesli&quot; in some regions). For breakfast, most Swiss enjoy sliced bread with butter and jam; bread also accompanies most meals. There is a wide variety of breads made in Switzerland, from &quot;pain de seigle&quot; to Zopf. Tarts and quiches are also traditional Swiss dishes. Tarts in particular are made with all sorts of toppings, from sweet apple to onion.

Pork, poultry and beef are the most consumed meats in Switzerland. Pork is particularly omnipresent in Swiss cuisine; is it both consumed as cooked and cured meat. Swiss meat specialties are highly diversified: all sorts of pork sausages, bratwursts, smoked ham, salami, prosciutto, etc. Famous meat products include Grisons Meat (air-dried beef) and the &quot;national sausage&quot;, cervelat. Fish is eaten in moderation, traditionally once in a week. Swiss lakes and rivers provide a small fraction of fish and shellfish consumed in the country. These include the popular perch and fera, which are served in lakeshore restaurants.

Foods associated with Switzerland often use milk as an essential ingredient; butter and cream are classic ingredients in Swiss cuisine. They notably include hard cheeses and chocolate. Swiss cheeses, in particular Emmental, Gruyère, Vacherin, and Appenzeller, are famous Swiss products. Two of the most popular Swiss dishes are fondue and raclette, which essentially consist of melted cheese accompanied with bread or potatoes. The first solid milk chocolate was invented in Switzerland in 1875 and Switzerland has continued to be strongly associated with chocolate ever since then, with a thriving Swiss chocolate industry.

Food preferences vary within Switzerland, often reflecting languages: the German-speaking north and east (the predominant linguistic area) has strong ties with Central Europe, whereas the French-speaking west and the Italian-speaking south tend to have more ties with Western and Mediterranean Europe. This applies notably to starchy foods, dairy products and fish. While potatoes, rice and pasta are commonly eaten everywhere in Switzerland, the proportion of pasta and rice is larger in the Italian-speaking regions. Conversely, fats like cream and butter are eaten in larger proportions in the German-speaking regions. Fish is also more commonly eaten in French- and Italian-speaking Switzerland. Those differences are also noticeable in wine and beer drinking habits.

==History==
The agrarian regions began to specialize towards the end of the Middle Ages, thus developing their own food pattern: in the Alpine regions, breeders fed on dairy products, cheese, nuts, berries, mushrooms, vegetables and fruits; on the Plateau, ploughmen fed on porridge, soups, bread, legumes, vegetables and, from time to time, wine. The diet varied greatly according to the seasons. Fresh garden vegetables gave way in winter to dried fruit and sauerkraut. The occasional famines forced the consumption of more acorns, beets, roots and breads made of substitutes.

The population boom of the early modern period led, while agricultural productivity stagnated, to an impoverishment of the diet (essentially based on porridge) and a decline in meat consumption. The supply was irregular, shortages and high prices frequent. However, the European colonization of the Americas led to the introduction of new food products, such as sugar and various fruits and vegetables. The 18th century finally experienced the food revolution which notably saw the introduction of potato, maize and cocoa. Maize spread to Ticino, the St. Gallen Rheintal and a few valleys in Graubünden, which adopted polenta for breakfast. Meanwhile, the potato was adopted as staple food in most regions of the country.

==National dishes==

A few dishes have become emblematic of Swiss cuisine and highly popular throughout the country. All of them have also become popular outside Switzerland&#x27;s borders.

===Muesli===

Muesli, known in Switzerland as &quot;Birchermüesli&quot;, is a breakfast or snack consisting of cereal (oat) flakes, chopped fruit and milk. There are many ways of making a muesli, for example with honey, yoghurt and nuts. Muesli was created by the Swiss nutritionist Max Bircher-Benner in the early 20th century. His &#x27;apple diet dish&#x27;, developed as part of a raw food diet, was originally served to sanatorium patients as an easily digestible evening meal. After the Second World War, muesli became very popular throughout Switzerland thanks to home cooking courses and being served to the armed forces. Nowadays muesli is a staple in Western breakfast culture and is especially popular among athletes as a nutritional supplement.

===Rösti===

Rösti is a kind of fried potato cake served as a main course or side dish. As a main dish, rösti is usually accompanied with cheese, onions and cold meat or eggs. This dish, originally from Zürich, was first simply made by frying grated raw potatoes in a pan. It has then spread towards Bern where it is made with boiled potatoes instead. This is where it took the name &quot;Rösti&quot;. There are many variants in Switzerland and outside the borders. This culinary specialty gives its name to the röstigraben, which designates the cultural differences between the German- and French-speaking parts of the country.

===Fondue and raclette===

Fondue is a dish of usually several hard cheeses, such as Gruyère and Vacherin, which are melted with white wine and eaten hot with bread. It is served in a caquelon in which each guest dips their piece of bread using a special fork. At the base of the fondue pot is the heat source (stove or candles). Fondue was first described in 1699 in a Zürich manuscript by Albert Hauser. It is entitled &quot;To cook cheese with wine&quot; and resembles the recipe of today. Fondue was also promoted by the Swiss Cheese Union in the early 20th century. Today, it is often considered to be &quot;the&quot; national dish.

Raclette is also a dish of melted cheese, originating from Valais. Traditionally, half a cheese wheel is heated on the cut side and, as it melts, the cheese is scraped off onto a plate. Now, this is often performed using an electric appliance. Raclette is served with skin-on potatoes and mixed pickles, and often accompanied by Fendant as a drink. Melting cheese in front of a fire is attested in the 16th century. Since 1875, the French term &quot;raclette&quot; is commonly used for this dish. At the 1909 Cantonal Exhibition of Sion, raclette was promoted as a national dish of Valais. Raclette eventually gained national (and international) popularity from the 1964 National Exhibition.

Contrary to muesli and rösti, fondue and raclette are not meant to be staple foods, but rather convivial dishes intended for special occasions. Both fondue and raclette are especially popular during cold weather and have become associated with mountain culture and winter sports.

===From the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland===
The Italian-speaking part of Switzerland essentially coincides with Ticino, but also with the southern valleys of Graubünden. Popular dishes are polenta and risotto, often accompanied by the Luganighe and Luganighetta, a type of artisan sausages. Typical food from Ticino can be found in a Grotto, the local type of restaurant. Chestnut is also a historical staple food of southern Switzerland. The chestnut tree, introduced there 2,000 years ago, was referred to as the &quot;bread tree&quot;. Another specific product of Ticino is olive oil; olive cultivation was revived in the late 20th century.

*Polenta: For centuries polenta was regarded as a meal for the poor. Corn was introduced to the south of what is now Ticino as long ago as the beginning of the 17th century, which led to a change in the monotonous cuisine. But it took another 200 years before polenta - at first made of mixed flour, only later of pure cornmeal - became the staple dish of the area.
*Risotto is another common dish from Ticino. It is made with either mushrooms, saffron or cheese. It is often accompanied with either cooked pork sausages (&quot;Luganighe&quot;) or other regional cured meats, like salami, coppa and prosciutto.
*Pizzoccheri is a type of short tagliatelle, a flat ribbon pasta, made with a blend of buckwheat flour and wheat flour. It is believed to have originated in Valtellina, a valley in the northern Italian region of Lombardy. They are also popular in Val Poschiavo, a side valley of Valtellina which belongs to the Swiss canton of Grisons.
*Bruscitti are an Italian and Swiss single-course meal of the Lombard, Piedmontese and Ticinese cuisines (Switzerland) based on finely chopped beef cooked for a long time. Other ingredients of the dish are butter, lard, garlic, pancetta and fennel seeds. At the end of cooking they are blended with well-structured red wines such as Barbera, Barolo or Gattinara. This dish is served with the &quot;polenta&quot;, &quot;risotto alla milanese&quot; or purée.

===From the canton of Graubünden===

*Bündner Nusstorte: There are several different regional recipes for nut cake, but the most famous is probably the one from the Engadin valley in the canton of Graubünden.
*Bündnerfleisch (GR)
*Chur meat pie
*Bündner barley soup: The most famous soup from Graubünden
*Capuns: Typical speciality of western Graubünden
*Maluns
*Pizokel with cabbage: Pizokel were eaten in a wide variety of ways. In some places when eaten by themselves they are known in Romansh as &quot;bizochels bluts&quot;, or “bald pizokel”. If someone leaves a small amount of any kind of food on the serving dish for politeness&#x27;s sake, in the Engadine this is called &quot;far sco quel dal bizoccal&quot;, meaning more or less “leaving the last pizokel”.

==Restaurants and &quot;haute cuisine&quot;==
A large variety of restaurants can be found in Switzerland. The &quot;Stube&quot;, &quot;Stübli&quot; or &quot;Stiva&quot; (German and Romansh), &quot;Brasserie&quot; (French) and &quot;Osteria&quot; (Italian) typically serve simple and traditional dishes. This is even more the case in mountain restaurants or mountain huts.

A unique type of restaurant is found in Ticino: the Grotto. Grottoes are rustic eateries, offering traditional food, such as polenta. Authentic grottoes are old wine caves re-functioned into restaurants. Due to their nature they are mostly found in or around forests and built against a rocky background. Typically, the facade is built from granite blocks and the outside tables and benches are made of the same stone as well. Grottoes are popular with locals and tourists alike, especially during the hot summer months.

As a culinary hotspot in the middle of Europe where high-quality ingredients are readily available, Switzerland boasts a high number of luxury restaurants. It also has a long tradition of hospitality, which is reflected in the palace hotels found in numerous localities. In the 2018 Michelin Guide, Switzerland ranked first worldwide in terms of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita. As of 2022, four restaurants were awarded 3 stars: the Restaurant de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville in Crissier, the Schloss Schauenstein in Fürstenau, the Cheval Blanc in Basel and the Memories in Bad Ragaz. Among famous Swiss chefs are Frédy Girardet and Anton Mosimann.

==Beverages==

Wine is produced in many regions of Switzerland, particularly the Valais, the Vaud, the Geneva, the Ticino, the Neuchâtel and the Zürich cantons. Wine economy notably shaped the landscapes of Valais and the Lavaux, which have the most extensive terraced vineyards. Riesling X Sylvaner is a common white wine produced in German-speaking parts of the country, while Chasselas is the most common white wine in the French-speaking parts of the country, where it can also be known as Fendant (in the Valais) and Perlan (in Geneva). Pinot noir is the most popular red grape in both the French-speaking and the German-speaking part, while this position is held by Merlot in the Italian-speaking part.

Beer is second to wine in terms of consumption among Swiss. The country has a long tradition of brewing, with significant domestic beer production and a growing craft brewing sector. Most contemporary large-scale breweries are in German-speaking Switzerland. The Feldschlösschen brewery in Rheinfelden dwarfs all others in the country in terms of output. Calanda brewery in Chur is the largest in Graubünden. Zürich hosts the country&#x27;s largest beer festival annually, and has a number of microbreweries.
Absinthe is perhaps the most famous Swiss spirit. It is legally distilled again in its Val-de-Travers birthplace, in the Jura region of Switzerland. Long banned by a specific anti-Absinthe article in the Swiss Federal Constitution, it was legalized again in 2005, with the adoption of the new constitution. Swiss absinthe is exported to many countries, with Kübler and La Clandestine Absinthe amongst the first new brands to emerge. Wine and beer can legally be purchased by youths aged 16 and up. Spirits and beverages containing distilled alcohol (including wine coolers like Bacardi Breezer) can be bought at age 18.

Damassine is a liqueur produced by distillation of the Damassine prune from the Damassinier tree and is produced in the canton of Jura.

Bon Père William is a famous regional Swiss pear brandy containing 43% ABV. It is usually paired with fondue or raclette dishes or drunk after dinner, and sometimes poured into coffee alongside dessert. Some bottles are available with the full-size pear inside the bottle, grown with the bud placed in the bottle. There are many other types of regional brandies made from local fruit, the most popular being cherries (kirschwasser).

Rivella, a carbonated Swiss drink based on lactose, is one of the most popular drinks in Switzerland. Apple juice, both still and sparkling, is popular in many areas of Switzerland, as is apple cider. The chocolate drink Ovomaltine (also known as &quot;Ovaltine&quot;) originates in Switzerland and enjoys ongoing popularity, particularly with young people. Aside from being a beverage, the powder is also eaten sprinkled on top of a slice of buttered bread.

Switzerland has the seventh highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.

<text>Emmental, Emmentaler, or Emmenthal is a yellow, medium-hard cheese that originated in the Emme valley, Switzerland. It is classified as a Swiss-type cheese.

==History==
Emmental cheese is &quot;true&quot; Swiss cheese; i.e. it originates from the Emme valley, Switzerland.

It has a savory but mild taste. While &quot;Emmentaler&quot; is registered as a geographical indication in Switzerland, a limited number of countries recognize the term as a geographical indication: similar cheeses of other origins, especially from France (as Emmental), the Netherlands, Bavaria, and Finland, are widely available and sold by that name. In some parts of the world, the names &quot;Emmentaler&quot; and &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; are used interchangeably for Emmental-style cheese.

==Production==
Three types of bacteria are needed to prepare Emmental: &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus helveticus&quot;, and &quot;Propionibacterium freudenreichii&quot;. Historically, the holes were a sign of imperfection, and until modern times, cheese makers would try to avoid them. Nowadays, however, eye formation is valued as a sign of maturation and quality and acoustic analysis has been developed for this purpose. Emmental cheese is usually consumed cold, as chunks or slices, and is also used in a variety of dishes, particularly in gratins, and fondue, in which it is mixed with Gruyère, the other highly popular Swiss cheese.

Ziger, a whey cheese, is a by-product of the manufacture of Emmental.

==Protected varieties and nomenclature==
Several varieties of Emmental are registered as geographical indications, including:

===Switzerland===

&quot;Emmentaler&quot; was registered in 2000 as an &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) in Switzerland. In 2013, it was replaced by the &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine protégée&quot; (AOP) certification. The Emmentaler produced according to the AOC-registration needs to be produced in small rural dairies with raw cow&#x27;s milk, adding only natural ingredients (water, salt, natural starter cultures and rennet); preservatives or ingredients from genetically modified organisms are not allowed. The cheese is produced in a round shape with a natural rind, and aged in traditional cellars for a minimum of four months. Emmentaler must be produced in Kantons Aargau, Bern (except Amtsbezirk Moutier), Glarus, Luzern, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Zug or Zürich, or in the See- and Sensebezirk of Kanton Freiburg.

Emmentaler is also recognized as a geographical indication in the Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Jamaica, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia and Spain.

===Outside Switzerland===

Three cheeses containing the word Emmental are protected under EU law:
* &quot;Allgäuer Emmentaler&quot;, from Bavaria, Germany, has PDO status
* &quot;Emmental de Savoie&quot;, from Savoie, France, has PGI status
* &quot;Emmental français est-central&quot; from Franche-Comté, France, also has PGI status

In many parts of the English-speaking world the terms &quot;Emmentaler&quot; and &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; are both used to refer to any cheese of the Emmental type, whether produced in Switzerland or elsewhere. The United States Department of Agriculture, for example, uses the terms &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; and &quot;Emmentaler cheese&quot; interchangeably.

==Emmental-style cheeses==
Emmental cheese is very widely imitated around the world, often just called &quot;Swiss cheese&quot;. Specific European types include:
*Grevé from Sweden
*Jarlsberg cheese from Norway
*Maasdam cheese from the Netherlands, with Leerdammer being one variety

<text>Helianthus () is a genus comprising around 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of &quot;Helianthus&quot; are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (&quot;Helianthus annuus&quot;). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke (&quot;H. tuberosus&quot;), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species &quot;H. annuus&quot; typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.

Several perennial &quot;Helianthus&quot; species are grown in gardens, but have a tendency to spread rapidly and can become aggressive. On the other hand, the whorled sunflower, &quot;Helianthus verticillatus&quot;, was listed as an endangered species in 2014 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule protecting it under the Endangered Species Act. The primary threats to this species are industrial forestry and pine plantations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. They grow to and are primarily found in woodlands, adjacent to creeks and moist, prairie-like areas.

The common sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine, cultivated there for several centuries.

== Description ==

Sunflowers are usually tall annual or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of or more. Each &quot;flower&quot; is actually a disc made up of tiny flowers, to form a larger false flower to better attract pollinators. The plants bear one or more wide, terminal capitula (flower heads made up of many tiny flowers), with bright yellow ray florets (mini flowers inside a flower head) at the outside and yellow or maroon (also known as a brown/red) disc florets inside. Several ornamental cultivars of &quot;H. annuus&quot; have red-colored ray florets; all of them stem from a single original mutant. While the majority of sunflowers are yellow, there are branching varieties in other colors including, orange, red and purple.

The petiolate leaves are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, ovate, or often heart-shaped. The rough and hairy stem is branched in the upper part in wild plants, but is usually unbranched in domesticated cultivars.

This genus is distinguished technically by the fact that the ray florets (when present) are sterile, and by the presence on the disk flowers of a pappus that is of two awn-like scales that are caducous (that is, easily detached and falling at maturity). Some species also have additional shorter scales in the pappus, and one species lacks a pappus entirely. Another technical feature that distinguishes the genus more reliably, but requires a microscope to see, is the presence of a prominent, multicellular appendage at the apex of the style. Further, the florets of a sunflower are arranged in a natural spiral.

Variability is seen among the perennial species that make up the bulk of those in the genus. Some have most or all of the large leaves in a rosette at the base of the plant and produce a flowering stem that has leaves that are reduced in size. Most of the perennials have disk flowers that are entirely yellow, but a few have disk flowers with reddish lobes. One species, &quot;H. radula&quot;, lacks ray flowers altogether.

Overall, the macroevolution of the &quot;Helianthus&quot; is driven by multiple biotic and abiotic factors and influences various floral morphology.

&quot;Helianthus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of many lepidopterans.

=== Growth stages ===

The growth of a sunflower depends strictly on its genetic makeup and background. Additionally, the season it is planted will have effects on its development; those seasons tend to be in the middle of summer and beginning of fall. Sunflower development is classified by a series of vegetative stages and reproductive stages that can be determined by identifying the heads or main branch of a single head or branched head.

=== Facing the Sun (heliotropism) ===
Before blooming, &quot;Helianthus&quot; plant heads tilt upwards during the day to face the Sun. This movement is referred to as heliotropism, which continues for a short time when flower buds form and young &quot;Helianthus&quot; heads track the Sun. At night, the flower heads reorient their position and face East in anticipation for the sunrise. Sunflowers move back to their original position between the hours of 3am and 6am, and the leaves follow about an hour later.

By the time they are mature and reach anthesis, &quot;Helianthus&quot; generally stop moving and remain facing east, which lets them be warmed by the rising sun. Historically, this has led to controversy on whether or not &quot;Helianthus&quot; is heliotropic, as many scientists have failed to observe movement when studying plants that have already bloomed.

This is notably different from heliotropism in leaves, as the moving mechanism for leaves exists in the pulvinus. Since flowers do not have pulvini, the movement is caused by increased growth rate of the stems. The growth rate accumulation of the stem on the east side of the stem gradually pushes the flower from east to west during daytime. This matches with the Sun as it rises from the east and falls in the west. At night, the growth rate is higher in the west side of the stem that gradually pushes the flower from the west side back to the east side. In addition, it is not actually the whole plant that changes its direction to face the Sun, but the flower itself that bends to be illuminated by the Suns rays.

The heliotropic movement is caused by growth on the opposite side of the flower, driven by accumulation of growth hormones during Sun exposure.

Heliotropism persists on cloudy days when the sun is not shining brightly, meaning that the movement is endogenous as a trained and continuous process. However, flower movement does not occur during long periods of rain or clouds. It also does not occur in a growth chamber when exposed to 16 hours of light or in greenhouses, suggesting that the plants require a directional, moving light source. Helianthus can also discriminate between different types of light. When exposed to different light frequencies, the hypocotyls will bend toward blue light but not red light, depending on the quality of the light source.

It is the circadian rhythms and the differences of the stem growth rate that work together and cause the heliotropism of the &quot;Helianthus&quot;. This is important for attracting pollinators and increasing growth metabolism. Future studies are required to identify the exact physiological basis and cellular mechanism for this behavior.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Helianthus&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;hēlios&quot; &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;ánthos&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, because its round flower heads in combination with the ligules look like the Sun.

===Formerly included===
The following species were previously included in the genus &quot;Helianthus&quot;.
* &quot;Flourensia thurifera&quot; (as &quot;H. thurifer&quot; )
* &quot;Flourensia thurifera&quot; (as &quot;H. navarri&quot;)

==Uses==
The seeds of &quot;H. annuus&quot; are used as human food. Most cultivars of sunflower are variants of &quot;H. annuus&quot;, but four other species (all perennials) are also domesticated. This includes &quot;H. tuberosus&quot;, the Jerusalem artichoke, which produces edible tubers.

There are many species in the sunflower genus &quot;Helianthus&quot;, and many species in other genera that may be called sunflowers.

* The Maximillian sunflower (&quot;Helianthus maximiliani&quot;) is one of 38 species of perennial sunflower native to North America. The Land Institute and other breeding programs are currently exploring the potential for these as a perennial seed crop.
* The sunchoke (Jerusalem artichoke or &quot;Helianthus tuberosus&quot;) is related to the sunflower, another example of perennial sunflower.
* The Mexican sunflower is &quot;Tithonia rotundifolia&quot;. It is only very distantly related to North American sunflowers.
* False sunflower refers to plants of the genus &quot;Heliopsis&quot;.

==Ecology==

Sunflowers have been proven to be excellent plants to attract beneficial insects, including pollinators. &quot;Helianthus spp.&quot; are a nectar producing flowering plant that attract pollinators and parasitoids which reduce the pest populations in nearby crop vegetation. Sunflowers attract different beneficial pollinators (e.g., honey bees) and other known insect prey to feed on and control the population of parasitic pests that could be harmful to the crops. Predacious insects are first attracted to sunflowers once they are planted. Once the &quot;Helianthus spp.&quot; reaches six inches and produces flowers it begins to attract more pollinators. Distance between sunflower rows and crop vegetation plays an important role in this phenomenon, hypothesizing that closer proximity to the crops will increase insect attraction.

In addition to pollinators of &quot;Helianthus spp&quot;., there are other factors such as abiotic stress, florivory, and disease which also contribute to the evolution of floral traits. These selective pressures, which stem from several biotic and abiotic factors are associated with habitat environmental conditions which all play a role in the overall morphology of the sunflowers&#x27; floral traits.

An ecosystem is composed of both biotic (which are living elements of an ecosystem such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, and bacteria), and abiotic factors (non-living elements of an ecosystem such as air, soil, water, light, salinity and temperature).

It is thought that two biotic factors can explain for the evolution of larger sunflowers and why they are present in more drier environments. For one thing, the selection by pollinators is thought to have increased the sunflower&#x27;s size in a drier environment. This is because in a drier environment, there are typically less pollinators. As a result, in order for the sunflower to be able to attract more pollinators, they had to increase the morphology of their floral traits in that they had to increase their display size. Another biotic factor that can explain for the evolution of larger sunflowers in drier environments is that the pressure from florivory and disease favors smaller flowers in habitats that have a more moderate supply of moisture (mesic habitat). Wetter environments usually have more dense vegetation, more herbivores, and more surrounding pathogens. As larger flowers are typically more susceptible to disease and florivory, smaller flowers may have evolved in wetter environments which explains the evolution of larger sunflowers in more drier environments.

<text> () is a 1994 Indian Hindi-language comedy film written and directed by Rajkumar Santoshi and produced by Vinay Kumar Sinha. It stars Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karisma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal (in a dual role) and Shakti Kapoor. The film focuses on two gold diggers who attempt to woo an heiress to have access to her father&#x27;s wealth. They soon realize that the heiress has exchanged her identity with that of her secretary. By that point, one of them is genuinely in love with the heiress, and the other gold digger has fallen for the secretary.

The film was released on 4 November 1994 and the plot elements of the film were later used in other language films such as &quot;Ullathai Allitha&quot; (1996), &quot;Veedevadandi Babu&quot; (1997) and &quot;Galate Aliyandru&quot; (2000). The climax of this film is a rehashed version of the climax of a 1972 film &quot;Victoria No. 203&quot;. Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office, the film has since emerged as a cult film.

== Plot ==
Both Amar Manohar and Prem Bhopali are daydreamers living with their fathers Murli and Bankelal respectively. They learn that millionaire Ram Gopal Bajaj&#x27;s daughter Raveena Bajaj is coming to India from London with her secretary Karishma to find a suitable groom. Amar and Prem decide to woo Raveena to get a share in her father&#x27;s wealth. 

Amar and Prem meet each other when they escape from their towns and board a bus bound for Ooty where Raveena and Karishma live. They soon realise that they have the same goal and they also fail at several attempts to woo Raveena and Karishma but they manage to enter their house.

Amar pretends that he has lost his memory and eyesight after getting knocked out by Raveena when he tried to flirt with her, while Prem pretends to be a doctor at their house to cure him of his diseases but he unknowingly falls in love with Karishma. 

Meanwhile, nobody knows that Ram Gopal has an evil twin-brother Shyam Gopal &quot;Teja&quot; Bajaj who plans to kidnap him and pose as him to go to London. He has also sent his two sidekicks Robert and Bhalla to live in Raveena and Karishma&#x27;s house as their servants. Later, Amar and Prem discover that the secretary Karishma is actually the wealthy &quot;Raveena&quot; while the wealthy Raveena is actually the secretary &quot;Karishma&quot;, as they had exchanged their identities as Raveena wanted to find a suitable groom for herself who will love her, not her money. However, Amar still falls in love with the real Karishma while Prem also still falls in love with the real Raveena. 

Soon, Ram Gopal arrives in India and seeing the true nature of Amar and Prem, declines their marriages with Raveena and Karishma, respectively. They plan a fake kidnapping of him along with their friends where they will heroically &quot;rescue&quot; him which will make him agree to their marriages. Teja also plans along with Robert and Bhalla to kidnap Ram Gopal and steal all of his money converted into his diamonds. Robert and Bhalla somehow manage to kidnap Ram Gopal which shocks Amar and Prem. When they go to Teja&#x27;s hideout to rescue Ram Gopal, they mistake Teja for him and take him to his house. 

The next day, Raveena and Karishma tell their suspicion to Amar and Prem who discover the truth by secretly following Teja to his hideout where Ram Gopal tricks him and escapes his hideout prison. However, Amar and Prem mistake him for Teja and imprison him again - resulting in Teja imprisoning Amar and Prem as well before escaping from his hideout. Amar and Prem still manage to convince Robert and Bhalla that Ram Gopal is Teja and free him from prison. An escaping Teja is then stopped by Amar and Prem along with Robert and Bhalla. 

Meanwhile, throughout the film, Robert and Bhalla are constantly harassed by Crime Master Gogo who is demanding his money taken by Teja back, but he discovers Ram Gopal&#x27;s diamonds and he kidnaps him along with Raveena and Karishma. At Gogo&#x27;s hideout, Amar and Prem arrive and they try to control the situation along with Ram Gopal as each motive of each villain is revealed in a comic standoff. However, the police who were already called by Amar and Prem, are able to find Gogo&#x27;s hideout and arrest all of the criminals. Ram Gopal finally gets all of his diamonds back and he also agrees to the marriages of Amar and Prem with Real Karishma and Raveena (fake Raveena and fake Karishma), respectively.

==Production==

=== Development ===
After the success of his debut film &quot;Ghayal&quot; (1990), director Rajkumar Santoshi was approached by producer Vinay Kumar Sinha for a film. The latter wanted to make a film with Aamir Khan. Having made a film on a serious subject, Santoshi wanted to make a comedy film now. It was then decided that he would write a story about two warring buddies, the human versions of Tom and Jerry. Santoshi wrote the screenplay with Dilip Shukla, also modelling the characters on &quot;Archie comics&quot;. Despite the film feeling impromptu, every scene and dialogue was in the script. The film was in production for over three years. 

=== Casting ===
Santoshi then decided to cast Salman Khan followed by then relative newcomers Karisma Kapoor and Raveena Tandon as the female leads along with Paresh Rawal in a double role. Santoshi finished the script after the casting. He also wrote several dialogues on the set which were in his mind and not in the script. Amrish Puri was supposed to play the role of Mogambo&#x27;s younger brother, Zorambo. But due to the length of the film, the character was removed. Sunny Deol was supposed to do a cameo in the film, who was not available at that time. It was done by Govinda.

Initially, Salman Khan wanted more screen space than the other but later agreed to have the same amount of screen time. Tinnu Anand was offered the role of the villain &quot;Gogo&quot;, but could not do it because of date issues. It was eventually played by Shakti Kapoor. While shooting, Santoshi had to call for a cut as almost the entire crew including the director of photography laughed so hard that it shook the camera. The Muhurat shot was done by cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. took three years in making, which resulted in some continuity issues. Ishwar Bidri was the director of photography while V. N. Mayekar served as the editor.

=== Marketing ===
Aamir Khan made a special appearance in the 1993 film &quot;Damini&quot; to promote the film.

==Soundtrack==
The film featured 7 songs composed by Tushar Bhatia with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
The film was commercially unsuccessful at the box-office. Its total domestic gross was , and its overseas gross was $150,000, bringing its worldwide gross to .

The lack of publicity and tough competition from other films of that year were reasons for its business. Santoshi also attributes the failure to the fact that the film was not released and distributed well due to a new distributor. All of these films were very strong in their box office presence and , belonging to a different genre, could not compete well. It has however, in subsequent years, achieved a cult classic status among Hindi audiences.

=== Critical reception ===
While reviewing &quot;Grand Masti&quot; in 2013, critic Khalid Mohamed described in the &quot;collection of excellent comedies&quot; from Hindi cinema. Film critic Raja Sen called it a &quot;cornball classic&quot; and &quot;one of the greatest comedies in recent times.&quot; In 2014, comedian Aditi Mittal wrote: &quot;Writing about , I have realized, is like writing about mother&#x27;s love. Everyone has their own version of how it affects them, what lines they remember the most.&quot; The film was featured in &quot;Filmfare&quot;&#x27;s 100 Days series. This movie is available on YouTube. 

== Legacy ==
Several dialogues from this film like &quot;Teja main hu. Mark Idhar hai&quot;, &quot;Crime Master Gogo, Mogambo ka Bhatija&quot;, &quot;Do dost ek cup me chay piyenge&quot; etc., are popular. It went on to be an inspiration for the plot element of the Tamil film &quot;Ullathai Allitha&quot;, the Telugu film &quot;Veedevadandi Babu&quot; and the Kannada film &quot;Galate Aliyandru&quot;. did not have a bound script most of the dialogues were improvised by the cast and crew during the shoot of the film. The film was featured in &quot;Filmfare&quot;&#x27;s 100 Days series. It was voted as the 2nd best Bollywood comedy film of all time in an online poll conducted by &quot;The Indian Express&quot;.

The plot elements of the film were used in many languages as &quot;Ullathai Allitha&quot; (1996), &quot;Veedevadandi Babu&quot; (1997), and &quot;Galate Aliyandru&quot; (2000). &quot;Andaz Naya Naya&quot; is a Bollywood animated 3D film, an official remake of , but it has been shelved for unknown reasons. Producer Sidharth Jain began to question if the film would do any good at the box office because Indian animated films do not get the good market, so Jain shelved the film after being 35% done.

Robert, the character from the film played by Viju Khote, also makes an appearance in &quot;Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani&quot;, a 2009 film also directed by Rajkumar Santoshi.

<text>Gustave Émile Boissonade de Fontarabie (7 June 1825 – 27 June 1910) was a French legal scholar, responsible for drafting much of Japan&#x27;s civil code during the Meiji Era, and honored as one of the founders of modern Japan&#x27;s legal system.

==Biography==
Boissonade was born in Vincennes in 1825 to the famous scholar Jean François Boissonade de Fontarabie. He was a brilliant law student, and received his doctorate of law with honours from the University of Paris in 1853. He was in charge of law courses at Paris University until 1864, and was assistant law professor at the University of Grenoble until 1867.

In 1873 he was invited to lecture on constitutional and criminal law to some Japanese visitors to Paris, and received an invitation to work in Japan by the Japanese Ministry of Justice as one of several foreign legal scholars needed to assist with the drafting of Japan&#x27;s legal codes and in the renegotiation of the unequal treaties.

Boissonade remained in Japan for more than 21 years, from 1873 to 1895, and worked as an instructor in the Law School of the Ministry of Justice. He worked closely with Ume Kenjirō and Hozumi Nobushige in drafting much of Japan&#x27;s criminal and civil law. He was also an expert in international law, and was legal advisor to the government in the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. He was named a consultant to the &quot;Genrōin&quot; in 1875.

He also opposed Inoue Kaoru&#x27;s 1887 proposal to allow non-Japanese judges, and cautioned against too rapid movement towards revision of the unequal treaties.

He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd degree) in 1876 and was thus one of the few foreigners so honored at that time. Today, he is honored as one of the founders of Hosei University. The &quot;Boissonade Tower&quot;, the Ichigaya campus of Hosei University halfway between Ichigaya and Iidabashi stations in central Tokyo, a 26-story building completed in 2000, was named after him.

He returned to France in 1895 and lived in Antibes, where his tomb is located.

<doc id="851648" wikidata="Q135295" url="?curid=851648" title="Khaan">
<text>Khaan (; from Mongol &#x27;lord&#x27;) is an extinct genus of oviraptorid dinosaur known from remains found in the Djadochta Formation of Mongolia, dating to the Late Cretaceous (Campanian, 75-71 million years ago).

== Description ==

&quot;Khaan&quot; did not differ much from other oviraptorids. At first, its remains were assigned to &quot;Ingenia&quot;, but the &quot;Khaan&quot; manual structure, lacking the expansion of the upper third metacarpal, was considered to differ sufficiently from that of &quot;Ingenia&quot; for it to be assigned to its own genus.

The oviraptorid diet is disputed, with plants and molluscs having been suggested. Like other oviraptorids, &quot;Khaan&quot; was probably at least partially a meat eater, feeding on small vertebrates like mammals, lizards and possibly other small dinosaurs. It was also probably feathered.

== Discovery ==
The type species &quot;Khaan mckennai&quot; was named by James M. Clark &quot;et al.&quot; in 2001. The genus name is derived from Mongol &quot;khaan&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;. The specific name honours the paleontologist Malcolm Carnegie McKenna.

The holotype IGM 100/1127 consists of an almost complete skeleton found together with another specimen, IGM 100/1002. Together they were informally referred to as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. These individuals are about four feet long. A third, considerably larger, specimen, IGM 100/973, was referred to the species.

== Classification ==
&quot;Khaan&quot; was by Clark assigned to the Oviraptoridae. Among oviraptorids, it was probably more closely related to &quot;Conchoraptor&quot;.

The cladogram below follows an analysis by Fanti &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012.

==Paleobiology== 

According to a 2014 study published in Nature, &quot;Khaan&quot; was possibly sexually dimorphic. Two specimens, the holotype MPC-D 100/1127 and referred specimen MPC-D 100/1002, were analyzed, the dimorphic feature being in the anterior chevrons. Both specimens were of the same size and build, and thus were likely the same age, ruling out ontogeny. In MPC-D 100/1127, the anterior chevrons showed great similarity to those of other theropods, with no great expansion on the distal end. However, in the other individual, the chevrons had a &quot;heel&quot;-like expansion above the distal end, which increased in size along the sequence. The study ruled out a possibly pathologic explanation, finding sexual dimorphism to have more support. It was thought that the reduced spines were a female characteristic, because they would increase space for laying eggs. Also, the larger spines could be for male muscle attachments, which would support a tail fan.

A 2022 study of the bite force of &quot;Khaan&quot; and comparisons with other oviraptorosaurs such as &quot;Incisivosaurus&quot;, &quot;Citipati&quot;, and &quot;Conchoraptor&quot; suggests that &quot;Khaan&quot; had a very strong bite force. The moderate jaw gape seen in oviraptorosaurs is indicative of herbivory in the majority of the group, but it is clear they were likely feeding on much tougher or more types of vegetation than other herbivorous theropods in their environment, such as ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs were able to. The examinations suggest oviraptorosaurs may have been powerful-biting generalists or specialists that partook of niche partitioning both in body size and cranial function.

<doc id="851649" wikidata="Q5333690" url="?curid=851649" title="Economy of Isan">
<text>The economy of [[Isan]], Thailand&#x27;s largest region, composed of 20 provinces in the northeast, is dominated by agriculture, although agricultural output is low and decreasing in importance while the trade and service sectors are growing. Much of the population is poor and badly educated. Many labourers have been driven by poverty to seek work in other parts of Thailand or abroad.

Isan accounts for around a third of Thailand&#x27;s population and a third of its area. In 2013 it contributed 10.9 percent of the kingdom&#x27;s GDP. The gross regional product (GRP) per capita in 2013 was 74,532 baht per year, the lowest of all Thai regions, 5.8 times lower than that of the leading eastern region.

World Bank report that after the 1997 Asian financial crisis Income in the northeast, the poorest part of Thailand, has risen by 46 percent from 1998 to 2001 due to Education For All. Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3 to 11.3 percent.

==Politically-driven upturn==
The first decade of the 21st century saw improvements in Isan&#x27;s economy. Economic growth in the region reached 40 percent from 2007 to 2011, versus 23 percent for the country as a whole, and just 17 percent for greater Bangkok. Monthly household income rose 40 percent between 2007 and 2011, the biggest jump of any Thai region.

Former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra came to power in 2001 and initiated a series of populist policies—-from virtually free healthcare to low-interest loans to the rural poor—that stimulated Isan&#x27;s economy. Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 coup, but his sister, Yingluck was elected prime minister in 2011. The economic renaissance of Isan coincided with the expansionary policies, from wage increases to farm subsidies, that were begun by Thaksin and continued by his sister. Yingluck&#x27;s government brought in a nationwide minimum wage of 300 baht a day in January 2013. In some Isan provinces, that was an increase of 35 percent, among the biggest gains in the country, on top of a nationwide 40 percent increase in April 2012. Yingluck was deposed in early-2014 and replaced by a military government in May.

The military government&#x27;s economic initiatives of 2016 call for two trillion baht (US$57 billion) to be fast-tracked into nationwide infrastructure projects. Only 10 percent of the funds are allocated to projects in Isan despite its accounting for 33 percent of the population. The majority will be spent on a new Khorat-Bangkok motorway.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the biggest sector of the economy. The following table shows the percentage of gross regional product (GRP) by sector in 2013:

For FY 2018, Northeastern Thailand Region had a combined economic output of 1,559 trillion baht (US$50.3 billion), or 9.5 percent of Thailand&#x27;s GDP. Loei province had an economic output of 54.769 billion baht (US$1.77 billion). This equates to a GPP per capita value of 100,796 baht (US$3,251), almost double than for Nong Bua Lamphu province, lowest in the ranking.


Khon Kaen province had an economic output of 211.192 billion baht (US$6.8 billion). This equates to a GPP per capita value of 122,950 baht (US$3,966), nearly 66 percent more than for Maha Sarakham province, next in the rank-list and double then for Yasothon province, lowest in the ranking.


Nakhon Ratchasima province had an economic output of 295.511 billion baht (US$9.5 billion). This amounts to a per capita GPP value of 115,517 baht (US$3,726), 56 percent more than for Maha Sarakham province, next in the rank-list.

===Agriculture===


Agriculture remains the largest sector of the economy, but its importance is decreasing. Its share of GRP fell from 45 percent in 1980 to 33.2 percent in 1990, and to 27.1 percent in 2013. During the 1990s, the agricultural sector grew at 3.8 percent per annum, compared to 9.7 percent for the service sector. Although 76 percent of the population engages in some form of agriculture, only 46 percent of the workforce is formally employed in the sector, reflecting the fact that for many it is a part-time occupation.

Of the region&#x27;s 155,400 km2, only 92,204 km2 is cultivated, and only 7,770 km2 of that is irrigated. There are a number of reasons for this. Saline contamination makes a third of the land unfit for cultivation. Although average rainfall is not much less than in other parts of the country, its unpredictability often causes droughts or flooding. The latter is worsened by the generally flat terrain of the plateau, while both are exacerbated by the sandy soil, which is poor at retaining water. Deforestation reduced forest cover from 25 percent in 1975 to 14 percent in 1995, again inhibiting water retention.

Attempts to improve the agricultural sector through irrigation and diversification have caused unforeseen environmental damage. Increased irrigation has raised the water table in some areas, bringing salt to the surface and contaminating the soil. The same effect has also been observed following forest clearance and the planting of cereal crops, cassava, and sugar cane.

Irrigation has also proved somewhat ineffective in increasing agricultural production. Workers commonly work in agriculture during the wet season and turn to non-farm activities during the dry season. Using irrigation to increase dry season production would therefore reduce the labour devoted to these other activities and so reduce the income they provide, rather than supplementing it.

The cultivated land is relatively unproductive: paddy fields produce only 424 tonnes of rice per square mile, compared to 547 nationally. Most farmers can produce only one crop of rice a year. Many farmers still use water buffalo rather than tractors.

Sixty percent of cultivated land is devoted to rice paddies. The concentration on rice farming has made the farmers vulnerable to fluctuating prices. This has been reduced somewhat by increased diversification, but Isan still accounts for half of Thailand&#x27;s exports of rice, cassava, and sugar. These crops employ 700,000 Isan families. Other crops include, tobacco, cotton, and watermelons.

===Tourism===
According to the governor of Nakhon Phanom Province, &quot;The entire Northeast [Isan] gained only 2.9 percent of [the] country&#x27;s tourism income of 2.7 trillion baht [in 2017].&quot;

===Other sectors===
Other sectors of the economy have been growing more quickly than agriculture, although this growth can be misleading. The number of factories grew from 1,908 in 1975 to 44,000 in 1995, but 34,312 of these were rice mills. In 2000, 76 percent of Isan factories were breweries or food or tobacco processors.

A study conducted by Khon Kaen University estimated that each year 8.67 billion baht is sent by foreign husbands to their wives in Isan. The 2010 census found that 90 percent of the slightly more than 27,000 foreigners living in the northeastern region were married to women from there.

==Poverty==
Isan&#x27;s economic disadvantages have caused great poverty. Most of Thailand&#x27;s rural poor live in Isan. In 1995, 28 percent of the population was classed as below the poverty line, compared to just seven percent in central Thailand. In 2000, per capita income was just 26,317 baht, compared to 208,434 in Bangkok. Even within Isan, there is a rural/urban divide.

In 1995, all of Thailand&#x27;s ten poorest provinces were in Isan, the poorest being Sisaket Province. In 2012, six of Thailand&#x27;s ten poorest provinces were in Isan, Kalasin being the poorest province in the region. From 2000 to 2012, half of Thailand&#x27;s eight provinces with chronic poverty were in Isan. Most wealth and investment is concentrated in the four major cities of Khorat, Ubon, Udon, and Khon Kaen. These four provinces account for 40 percent of the region&#x27;s population.

==Workforce==
A survey in spring 2001 found a total labour force of 10.7 million. Almost 600,000 of those were seasonal labourers between work, and 5.2 percent were unemployed. The remaining 9.5 million were employed as follows:

The population is poorly-educated, with 6.4 million over 15 not having completed primary school. Four million have a primary education, 2.2 million secondary, and 829,736 have a university level education (all as of 2001). There is little incentive for better education, as most job vacancies require few or no educational qualifications.

==Economic migrants==
Many Isan people have sought work elsewhere. In the first half of the 1990s, 420,000 workers moved elsewhere in Thailand (60 percent of them to Bangkok). Many of the taxicab drivers, shop and factory workers and construction workers in the capital are from Isan. The economic advantages of migrant labour have come at a social cost. While some workers migrate annually, other families are divided, often for many years.

The Thai government&#x27;s National Economic and Social Development Board estimates that remittances from Isan women overseas amount to US$35 million per year, equivalent to six percent of the region&#x27;s economic output. Researchers estimate that at least 15,000 Isan women are married to foreign men.

Rural Isan is a disproportionate supplier of workers to the sex trade, both domestically and abroad. This is partly a legacy of Vietnam-era US bases, but mostly due to the region&#x27;s poverty. As one researcher summed it up, &quot;The equation looks like this: One working day in a tapioca field pays $8 (300 baht). One working day at a multinational chicken factory pays $11 (400 baht). One working day at a metal factory in Denmark pays $91 (3200 baht), and one busy working day at a Danish brothel pays $450 (15,800 baht).&quot;

Sex workers from Isan see prostitution as a way out of poverty. One former sex worker from Maha Sarakham said she entered Bangkok&#x27;s sex trade at the age of 19 and earned up to 5,000 baht (US$143.14) a night, nearly 20 times the minimum wage of 300 baht (US$8.59) per day. &quot;No one wants to work in this business, but it&#x27;s fast and easy money,&quot; she said.

<doc id="851651" wikidata="Q1437563" url="?curid=851651" title="Swiss Cheese Union">
<text>The Swiss Cheese Union (, ) was a marketing and trading organization in Switzerland, which served as a cartel to control cheese production from 1914 to 1999. To this end, the Swiss Cheese Union mandated production be limited to only a few varieties, chiefly Gruyere and Emmental, and bought the entire production and distribution of cheese at prices set by the Swiss Federal Council. It also coordinated the national and international marketing for these varieties of cheese.

The Swiss Cheese Union was particularly successful in campaigning for cheese fondue, which became a very popular dish in Switzerland and abroad. It is now often considered to be the Swiss national dish. Before that, it was only a regional dish.

== History ==

=== 1914-1920s ===
Throughout the course of World War I, Switzerland remained neutral and maintained the health of its massive cheese production industry. Exports of the product suffered in part due to the devastation wrought upon customers in the surrounding countries; these numbers would remain low until after World War II. The war exacerbated this further as a lack of hay and fodder to use as feed for dairy animals showed sharp decreases in production.

In an effort to combat this slump in exports, cheese producers were determined to develop strict non-compete guidelines, establishing a cartel that became known as the Swiss Cheese Union. According to journalist Robert Smith, &quot;The union set the price for milk. It told dairymen how much milk to produce and who they could sell it to. They told the cheesemakers how much cheese to make, and then set the prices for the cheese. And it was all so complicated, this cheese business, that they actually narrowed down the number of cheeses that people could produce. Switzerland used to make over 1,000 different kinds of cheeses; the Cheese Union supported seven.&quot;

=== Inter-War Period ===
The Swiss Cheese Union&#x27;s success in controlling production soon presented a problem: overproduction of cheese in a saturated, stagnant market. Initially, the Swiss Cheese Union was able to float the dairy market by buying cheese from the milk association at fixed prices and then reselling the cheese to itself, but the logic of this was so dizzying that it could not be the final answer.

A more long-term solution presented itself in the form of fondue. According to former director of the Musee Gruerien Isabelle Raboud-Schuele, &quot;Up until 1930, fondue was essentially only known in the French-speaking part of Switzerland but thereafter it became popular throughout Switzerland, to the point of becoming a national dish. This was due to the success of intensive campaigns to promote cheese, led by the Swiss Union for Marketing Cheese in the 1930s. Cheese production exceeded consumption and hence in order to expand the market for this former export, the Swiss needed to be convinced to eat more cheese.&quot;

Though marketed by the Swiss Cheese Union as an Alpine specialty, the dish did not originate in the mountains. Alpine cheese-making was limited to the summer months, and fondue was thus in the 18th century eaten only by upper class households in small towns in the Jura region and lowland Switzerland; cheese making spread throughout the country in the following century and became easier to make year-round thanks to advances in equipment. Alpine-cheese making could not keep up with the strong competition, and the economy of mountain-produced cheese weakened. According to Dominik Flammer, the author of &quot;Swiss cheese: origins, traditional cheese varieties and new creations&quot;, typical families might have the dish only a few times a year.

These facts did not stop the Swiss Cheese Union from fabricating an almost infectious enthusiasm for fondue in its marketing materials, drawing on a recipe requiring vast amounts of Swiss cheese and steeped in a narrative of tradition. The Swiss Cheese Union used iconography known around the world to promote the dish, invoking Heidi (the stories of whom had been translated into many languages at this point) to underline the wholesomeness and authenticity of the Swiss dish. Posters showcasing rain or snow as “fondue weather” reinforced the notion that fondue delivers a feeling of warmth in guests, and the recipes and tips were given on how to prepare fondue for anywhere from four to one hundred people, encouraging conspicuous consumption of the mass produced product.

=== Rebellion ===
A rebel cheesemaker named Sepp Barmettler strove against this near-universal acceptance of cheese restrictions and aimed to add the Parmesan-like Sbrinz cheese to the list of allowed cheeses. After eight years of applications and appeals to the Swiss Cheese Union, his request was denied. In a letter to Barmettler, no specific reason was given for the denial, but it was noted to Barmettler that &quot;you do not fit into the envisaged structures.&quot; Nevertheless, Barmettler continued to produce small, soft cheeses stanser fladen, selling them directly to small vendors like hotels and small restaurants rather than to the larger distributors that would have caught the attention of the cartel. After the collapse of the cartel, an explosion of new cheeses from Switzerland came onto the market, from recreations of old recipes to continuations of classics like Sepp helped keep alive.

=== Decline of the Union ===

As the country&#x27;s reputation shifted from that of a dairy farming nation raising cows to one peopled by scientists and engineers, concern grew over the vast sums of taxpayer money pumped into the dairy industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, the dairy industry purportedly cost the Swiss government more than the whole cost of the army of Switzerland.

The Swiss Cheese Union sponsored the 1992-1993 Swiss National Ski Team. The team wore yellow ski suits with simulated cheese holes.

After corruption charges were leveled against a number of the Swiss Cheese Union officials, the union was disbanded by the late 1990s. Dairy subsidies continued, but competition between cheese makers was reintroduced, causing prices to plummet.

<text>Appenzeller cheese () is a hard cow&#x27;s-milk cheese produced in the Appenzellerland region of northeast Switzerland, in the two modern-day cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden. It is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese.

== History ==
Cheese from Appenzellerland has a documented history of at least 700 years, being first mentioned in a document from 1282. However, the manufacturing process is not mentioned and may have been different from currently.

About 75 dairies produce Appenzeller, each with a different recipe for their brine wash. Most of the recipes are trade secrets.

== Production ==
An herbal brine, sometimes incorporating wine or cider, is applied to the wheels of cheese while they cure, which flavors and preserves the cheese while promoting the formation of a rind.

== Variants ==
The cheese is straw-colored, with tiny holes and a golden rind. It has a strong smell and a nutty or fruity flavour, which can range from mild to tangy, depending on how long it is aged. Three types are sold:

*&quot;Classic&quot;. Aged three to four months, mildly spicy. The wheels are wrapped in a silver label.
*&quot;Surchoix&quot;. Aged four to six months, strongly spicy. Gold label.
*&quot;Extra&quot;. Aged six months or longer, extra spicy. Black label.

<text>The word limma or leimma (from Greek: , &quot;leimma&quot;; meaning &quot;remnant&quot;) can refer to several different musical intervals, and one form of breath-mark to indicate spacing within lyrics; their only common property is that all are very small either in pitch difference or in time.

== Pitch ==
More specifically, in Pythagorean tuning (i.e. 3-limit):
* The original Pythagorean limma, , a Pythagorean interval ().

and in 5-limit tuning:
* The 5-limit diatonic semitone, (). Although closer in size to the Pythagorean apotome than to the limma, it has been so called because of its function as a diatonic semitone rather than a chromatic one.

* The 5-limit limma (now a diesis), , the amount by which three just major thirds fall short of an octave ().

* The major limma, , which is the difference between two major whole tones and a minor third ().

== Metre ==
A leimma is &quot;also&quot; the name of a musical / metrical symbol () for the timing of sung lyrics. If written over lyrics to it directed the singer to insert the &quot;shortest possible pause&quot; between words or syllables it was placed over.

Modern equivalents are:
* a breath mark
* a comma [,]
* a sixteenth rest () or perhaps a thirty-second rest ()

<text>True West Magazine (alternate title: True West) is an American magazine that covers the Old West.

Started in 1953, &quot;True West&quot; is headquartered in Cave Creek, Arizona, and publishes monthly. It is the world&#x27;s oldest, continuously published Western American magazine.

== History ==
&quot;True West&quot; began publication in 1953 under founder Joe Small of Austin, Texas. The idea for &quot;True West&quot; originated from a monthly feature in Small&#x27;s first publication, &quot;Sporting Magazine&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s recurring &quot;Bad Man&quot; article, about outlaws of the West, was the feature that generated the most reader mail and interest. &quot;True West&quot; was born to satisfy the readers&#x27; hunger for Old West history.

&quot;True West&quot; was the largest Western magazine on the market in the 1960s, selling hundreds of thousands of copies monthly at newsstands. The magazine benefited from an era featuring popular television western series such as &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. At least one episode, &quot;The Hunted&quot; (1958), of the ABC/Warner Brothers series &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; is based on a &quot;True West&quot; article. Fans interested in the lives of real cowboys and cowgirls found those stories in &quot;True West.&quot;

After that, the early era of television westerns faded during the time of the Vietnam War and disco music. In 1979, Small sold the magazine to Chet Krause of Iola, Wisconsin. Small stayed on as publisher, with Krause as assistant publisher. The magazine saw a few moves—to Perkins, Oklahoma, then Stillwater—before the 1999 move to Cave Creek, Arizona. Among its new owners was Bob Boze Bell, who first discovered the magazine as a nine-year-old at Desert Drugs in Kingman, Arizona. The publication sparked a lifelong interest in the Old West. As the January 2000 issue was being edited, Bell flew to Stillwater to design the cover because he, &quot;wanted to own the millennium.&quot;

Bell felt the magazine needed to change with the times or it would not survive. One of the first changes he made was switching the magazine from pulp paper to gloss, as &quot;True West&quot; was one of the last remaining publications using pulp. He also expanded the coverage of Western movies, since so many people developed a love of Old West history after being exposed to Westerns on television or the big screen. He added, and still writes, the successful &quot;Classic Gunfights&quot; department that has featured more than one hundred gunfights of the Old West.

In 2007, Ken Amorosano joined the team as associate publisher. In 2011, he became &quot;True West&#x27;s&quot; publisher and set the magazine in a new direction, catering the publication more toward its core history aficionados and expanding the magazine&#x27;s readership globally.

== Television ==
Executive editor Bob Boze Bell is regularly featured on &quot;True West Moments&quot;, which airs on Encore&#x27;s Westerns channel. He responds to inquiries from around the world.

In 2012, in honor of Arizona&#x27;s centennial, &quot;True West&quot; created and released the show &quot;Outrageous Arizona&quot;, an irreverent and humorous look at the history of Arizona, hosted by Bob Boze Bell and &quot;True West&quot; contributors Jana Bommersbach and Marshall Trimble. The show aired on select PBS stations in the Southwest. Outrageous Arizona received an EMMY Award from Rocky Mountain Southwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) in 2013.

<doc id="851669" wikidata="Q1502223" url="?curid=851669" title="Great Gable">
<text>Great Gable is a mountain in the Lake District, United Kingdom. It is named after its appearance as a pyramid from Wasdale, though it is dome-shaped from most other directions. It is one of the most popular of the Lakeland fells, and there are many different routes to the summit. Great Gable is linked by the high pass of Windy Gap to its smaller sister hill, Green Gable, and by the lower pass of Beck Head to its western neighbour, Kirk Fell.

==Topography==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards, the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumbria. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells forming a horseshoe around this valley.

Great Gable and its lesser companion Green Gable stand at the head of Ennerdale, with the walkers&#x27; pass of Sty Head to their backs. This connects Borrowdale to Wasdale, giving Gable a footing in both valleys. The Borrowdale connection is quite tenuous, but Great Gable is prominent in almost any view up the lake.

The upper section of Great Gable has a roughly square plan, about half a mile on each side, with the faces running in line with the four points of the compass. The fells connecting and subsidiary ridges occupy the corners of the square.

The northern face is formed by Gable Crag, prominent in views from Haystacks and the surrounding fells. This is the longest continuous wall of crag on the fell and reaches up almost to the summit. Scree slopes fall away below to the headwaters of the River Liza, which flows down Ennerdale. There are few crags on the eastern slopes, although these fall steeply to Styhead Tarn, a feeder of the Borrowdale system. About deep, this tarn occupies a scooped hollow, dammed by boulders fallen from the slopes above. It is reputed to contain trout and is a popular location for wild camping. The southern flank of Great Gable falls direct to Lingmell Beck, one of the main feeders of Wastwater. Right below the summit are the Westmorland Crags, and then a second tier breaks out lower down. These are Kern Knotts, Raven Crag and Great Napes, all footed by great tongues of scree. Finally on the west rough slopes fall below the rocks of White Napes to the narrow valley of Gable Beck, a tributary of Lingmell Beck.

From the north-western corner of the pyramid the connecting ridge to Kirk Fell runs out across the col of Beck Head (). There is a small tarn in the depression, and sometimes a second after heavy rain. Both are blind, having no apparent inlet or outflow. Gable Beck runs south from Beck Head, while an unnamed tributary of the Liza flows northward. The main spine of the Western Fells continues along the north east ridge to Green Gable, dropping to Windy Gap () as it rounds the end of Gable Crag. This ridge is rough and rocky, further worn by the boots of countless walkers. Stone Cove lies on the Ennerdale side while the rough gully of Aaron Slack runs down toward Styhead Tarn. The south-eastern ridge provides the connection to the Southern Fells, across the pass of Sty Head. This is a major crossroads for walkers and climbers, the summit being at around . On the opposite slope is Great End in the Scafells. Kern Knotts lies on this south-east ridge, as does the small pool of Dry Tarn. The south-western ridge gives to high level connection, dropping down Gavel Neese in the angle between Lingmell Beck and Gable Beck.

==Geology==
Lying on the edge of the Scafell Syncline, the various strata dip to the east. The summit area is formed from a dacite lava flow (Scafell Dacite), directly underlain by the Lingmell Formation. This tuff, lapilli tuff and breccia outcrops a little to the west of the summit. Around Beck Head is evidence of the Crinkle Member, welded rhyolitic tuff and lapilli tuff with some breccia. A dyke of andesite and hybridised andesite porphyry is responsible for Kern Knotts.

==Summit==

The summit of Great Gable is strewn with boulders and the highest point marked by a rock outcrop set with a cairn. There is a plaque set on the summit rock commemorating those members of the Fell &amp; Rock Climbing Club who died in World War I; an annual memorial service is held here on Remembrance Sunday. The club bought 3,000 acres of land including Great Gable and donated it to the National Trust in memory of these members, and the plaque was dedicated on Whit Sunday 1924 by Geoffrey Winthrop Young in front of 500 people. The bronze memorial, weighing 70 kg, was removed on 10 July 2013 by 13 soldiers and carried down the hill via a stretcher. A replacement, with spelling errors corrected, was installed by Royal Engineers in October 2013.

Due to its central position within the Lake District and great prominence the summit offers panoramic views. All of the main fell groups are laid out, though Wast Water, Crummock Water and Windermere are the only lakes visible. A hundred yards to the south west of the summit, overlooking the Napes, is the Westmorland Cairn. This cairn was erected in 1876 by two brothers named Westmorland to mark what they considered to be the finest view in the Lake District. From here ground falls away into the upper Wasdale valley. Further cairns mark the top of Gable Crag. The summit has become a popular site for the scattering of ashes following cremation.

==Ascents==
Routes to climb to the summit start from all of the main dales that radiate out from central Lakeland. A popular route is to climb Sour Milk Gill from Seathwaite in Borrowdale, first ascending Green Gable before traversing Windy Gap.

==Other walking routes==
Alfred Wainwright described the &#x27;Gable Girdle&#x27;, a circuit around the fell at mid height. This links a number of existing paths, namely the north and south traverses, Styhead Pass, Aaron Slack and Moses Trod. The south traverse climbs westward from Sty Head and provides access to the Napes and Kern Knotts for rock climbers. The route offers views of Napes Needle, Sphinx Rock and many other climbing locations. The north traverse similarly runs beneath Gable Crag to Windy Gap. In the west the two traverses are joined by a section of Moses Trod, running up the southern side of Beck Head. &quot;Moses&quot; was a possibly apocryphal trader-cum-smuggler, based at Honister Quarry. His route contoured the fellside from there to provide access to Wasdale markets for his illicit whisky. Moses Trod would also function as a route with minimal uphill sections for transporting slate from the quarry to the coast. Aaron Slack provides a fast down from Windy Gap to Sty Head.

==Rock climbing==
Great Gable has cliffs to the north (Gable Crag) and south (Westmorland Crags, the Napes, and Kern Knotts). The Napes are important in the history of English rock climbing: Walter Parry Haskett Smith&#x27;s ascent of the detached pinnacle of Napes Needle in June 1886 is thought by some to mark the origins in England of rock climbing as a sport in its own right. A BBC documentary by Eye to Eye on the history of mountaineering in 1956 filmed Monica Jackson with Horace &quot;Rusty&quot; Westmoreland climbing it.

<text>Sbrinz is a very hard cheese produced in Central Switzerland. It is often used as grated cheese in Swiss cuisine, although it is also eaten in small pieces. The cheese is produced in only 42 dairies in Central Switzerland. Only local cow&#x27;s milk is used when producing this cheese. It is kept in the region until ready for consumption. It is the hardest of Swiss cheeses together with Berner Hobelkäse.

Sbrinz probably got its name from the town of Brienz in the Bernese Oberland. In the 16th and 17th centuries, there was a collecting point for both cheeses from the Oberland and Central Switzerland. Most of the cheese was then transported from there across the Alps. Customers in northern Italy soon named the cheese &quot;Sbrinz&quot; after this place. The term then also became common in Switzerland. A second explanation is based on the adoption of the Lombard dialect word &quot;sbrinzo&quot;, a term for hard cheese.

==Character==
Sbrinz is an extra hard full fat cheese. It contains approximately 40% to 45% of fat when dry. The cheese must ripen for 16 months before it can be sold as Sbrinz, and the full flavour only develops after about 24–30 months in storage.

==History==
Sbrinz is one of the oldest European cheeses. The Celtic ancestors of the Swiss were making cheese centuries before the birth of Christ. In the first century AD, Roman writer Columella (or Pliny the Elder) mentions in his writings &quot;Caseus Helveticus&quot;, which is probably Sbrinz. It seems certain, however, that it is mentioned in documents dating from 1530, which are kept in the state archive in Bern.

Starting in 2001, Sbrinz was granted an &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) certification. The AOC provides specifications for the origin of the milk and the processes that must be followed in order for the cheese to be labeled as Sbrinz. In 2013, this was replaced by the &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine protégée&quot; (AOP) certification.

==Consumption==
Sbrinz is commonly consumed in several ways: it can be grated, such as on pasta, or eaten in small pieces, often to accompany wine. Traditionally, Sbrinz is never cut, but grated, broken with a special cutter, or planed. It is also eaten in thin slices planed from the hard cheese. Sbrinz is often simply enjoyed with bread and butter.

<text>An investment trust is a form of investment fund found mostly in the United Kingdom and Japan. Investment trusts are constituted as public limited companies and are therefore closed ended since the fund managers cannot redeem or create shares. 

The first investment trust was the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, started in 1868 &quot;to give the investor of moderate means the same advantages as the large capitalists in diminishing the risk by spreading the investment over a number of stocks&quot;.

In many respects, the investment trust was the progenitor of the investment company in the U.S.

The name is somewhat misleading, given that (according to law) an investment &quot;trust&quot; is not in fact a &quot;trust&quot; in the legal sense at all, but a separate legal person or a company. This matters for the fiduciary duties owed by the board of directors and the equitable ownership of the fund&#x27;s assets.

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;investment trust&quot; has a strict meaning under tax law. However, the term is more commonly used within the UK to include any closed-ended investment company, including venture capital trusts (VCTs). The Association of Investment Companies is the trade association representing investment trusts and VCTs.

In Japan, investment trusts are called ; the largest stockholder of many public companies are usually trust banks handling the investment trusts, the largest being the Japan Trustee Services Bank, The Master Trust Bank of Japan and the Trust &amp; Custody Services Bank.

== Real estate investment trusts ==

In the United Kingdom, REITs are constituted as investment trusts. They must be UK resident and publicly listed on a stock exchange recognised by the Financial Conduct Authority. They must distribute at least 90% of their income.

== Classification of Investment Trusts ==
Investment trusts can hold a variety of assets: listed equities, government/corporate bonds, real estate, private companies and so on. These assets may be listed/incorporated/domiciled in any region. Moreover the investment objectives (growth, income, capital preservation...), risk profile (level of gearing, level of diversification via assets and risk factors) varies. According to such factors, investment trusts are classified into sectors by the industry body, the Association of Investment Companies. The largest sectors by assets under management in December 2017 were Global (£27.1 billion), Private Equity (£14.7 billion), UK Equity Income (£12.0 billion), Infrastructure (£10.0 billion) and Specialist Debt (£7.8 billion).

These sector classifications were revamped in spring 2019. The new list of sectors and constituents comprised 13 new sectors, 15 renamed sectors and 31 sectors that were unchanged. The new sectors were added to reflect the greater numbers of investment companies investing in alternative assets. The amount of money invested by investment companies in alternative assets grew from £39.5bn in 2014 to £75.9bn in 2019. The growing debt sector was separated into three new sectors, Debt – Direct Lending, Debt – Loans &amp; Bonds, and Debt – Structured Finance. Similarly, there were more specialist property sectors: Property – UK
Commercial, Property – UK Healthcare, Property – UK Residential, and Property – Debt. Most of the equity sectors were unchanged, but Asia was split into three new sectors, Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific Income, and Asia Pacific Smaller Companies. There were new sectors for Growth Capital and for Royalties.

== Organization ==
Investors&#x27; money is pooled together from the sale of a fixed number of shares which a trust issues when it launches. The board will typically delegate responsibility to a professional fund manager to invest in the stocks and shares of a wide range of companies (more than most people could practically invest in themselves). The investment trust often has no employees, only a board of directors comprising only non-executive directors. 

Investment trust shares are traded on stock exchanges, like those of other public companies. The share price does not always reflect the underlying value of the share portfolio held by the investment trust. In such cases, the investment trust is referred to as trading at a discount (or premium) to NAV (net asset value).

Unlike open-ended funds that are UCITS, investment trusts may borrow money in an attempt to enhance investment returns (known as gearing or leverage). UCITS funds are not permitted to gear for investment purposes.

The investment trust sector, in particular split capital investment trusts, suffered somewhat from around 2000 to 2003 after which creation of a compensation scheme resolved some problems. The sector has grown in recent years particularly through the launch of investment trusts investing in more illiquid assets such as property, private equity and infrastructure. Assets managed by investment trusts reached £174.4 billion at the end of December 2017.

==Split Capital Investment Trusts==

Most investment trusts issue only one type of share (ordinary shares) and have an unlimited life. Split capital investment trusts are investment trusts with more than one type of share, such as zero dividend preference shares, income shares and capital shares. However, the number of split capital trusts has fallen dramatically since the split capital investment trust crisis and there were only 12 split capital investment trusts left in existence by 2018. Each of these 12 has only two classes of share: zero dividend preference shares and ordinary shares.

Some split capital trusts have a limited life determined at launch known as the wind-up date. Typically the life of a split capital trust is five to ten years. However, this life can be extended by shareholder vote. 

In the heyday of split capital trusts, splits were more complicated and could have share classes such as the following (in order of typical priority and increasing risk):
* &quot;Zero Dividend Preference shares&quot;: no dividends, only capital growth at a pre-established redemption price (assuming sufficient assets)
* &quot;Income shares&quot;: entitled to most (or all) of the income generated from the assets of a trust until the wind-up date, with some capital protection
* &quot;Annuity Income shares&quot;: very high and rising yield, but virtually no capital protection
* &quot;Ordinary Income shares&quot; (AKA Income &amp; Residual Capital shares): a high income and a share of the remaining assets of the trust after prior ranking shares
* &quot;Capital shares&quot;: entitled most (or all) of the remaining assets after prior ranking share classes have been paid; very high risk

The type of share invested in is ranked in a predetermined order of priority, which becomes important when the trust reaches its wind-up date. If the Split has acquired any debt, debentures or loan stock, then this is paid out first, before any shareholders. Next in line to be repaid are Zero Dividend Preference shares, followed by any Income shares and then Capital. Although this order of priority is the most common way shares are paid out at the wind-up date, it may alter slightly from trust to trust.

Splits may also issue &quot;Packaged Units&quot; combining certain classes of share, usually reflecting the share classes in the trust usually in the same ratio. This makes them essentially the same investment as an ordinary share in a conventional Investment Trust.

== Taxation==
Provided that it is approved by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, an investment trust&#x27;s investment income and capital gains are generally not taxed within the investment trust. This avoids the double taxation which would otherwise arise when shareholders receive income, or sell their shares in the investment trust and are taxed on their gains.

An approved investment trust must
* be resident in the United Kingdom
* derive most of its income from investments
* distribute at least 85% of its investment income as dividends (unless prohibited by company law)
The company must not hold more than 15% of its investments in any single company (except another investment trust) and must not be a close company. Investment trusts were in 2012 given the ability to distribute capital profits to shareholders. Investment trusts that wished to take advantage of this had to change their Articles of Association, with shareholders&#x27; approval, to allow such distributions. However, only a small minority of investment trusts distribute their capital profits.

<doc id="851686" wikidata="Q5674831" url="?curid=851686" title="2004 Hartlepool by-election">
<text>On 23 July 2004, the member of parliament for Hartlepool, in England, Peter Mandelson (Labour), was nominated as the United Kingdom&#x27;s new European Commissioner for Trade. On 8 September, he accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead, thereby disqualifying himself from Parliament, and causing a by-election. Polling took place on 30 September.

It was the last of six by elections held during the 2001–2005 Parliament.

==Results==
Out of a registered electorate of 68,517, there were 31,362 valid votes, making a turnout of 45.77%. This was the highest by-election turnout since the Romsey by-election in May 2000. The Labour Party candidate Iain Wright won the seat with a majority of 2,033, a substantially reduced majority. The Liberal Democrat vote more than doubled, leaving that party a close second. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) held its deposit, and beat the Conservative Party into fourth place.

This marked the first time UKIP had come third in a by-election (and followed a successful European election in June 2004, in which countrywide it had come third and won twelve seats). It would be over six years before the party improved on this position, when it took second place at Barnsley Central in 2011. It would go on to win a by-election for the first time a little over a decade after the Hartlepool contest, in Clacton in October 2014.

The Conservative vote in Hartlepool dropped considerably, leaving the party in fourth place for the first time in an English by-election since Liverpool Walton in 1991.







Robert Kilroy-Silk of UKIP initially suggested he might stand but later ruled this out, as did Hartlepool and Middlesbrough mayors Stuart Drummond and Ray Mallon.

Preceding by-elections had seen the Liberal Democrats come from third place to beat the Conservative Party, and in Brent East and Leicester South take seats from Labour. The seat was safer (judging by the 2001 result) than Leicester but was vulnerable to swings such as achieved in Brent, or in Birmingham Hodge Hill where the Liberal Democrats narrowly failed to win.

In the event, the Liberal Democrats were not quite able to repeat these performances. Their campaign suffered from the choice of a candidate who was not from Hartlepool, while the Labour candidate had been born and brought up in the town.

In addition, the Liberal Democrat candidate made reference, on a campaign blog, to having canvassed a street where everyone she met &quot;was either drunk, flanked by an angry dog, or undressed&quot;; this happened despite a Liberal Democrat minder, Ed Fordham, having been appointed by the party&#x27;s Campaigns Department to proof read Dunn&#x27;s blog before any posts went up. Fordham removed a reference to some of the people canvassed being Labour supporters, but he thought the rest of the comment was fine.

Labour gave wide publicity to this remark and asserted that it was an insult to the people of Hartlepool. Dunn defended her remarks on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, in a performance that was perceived to be unconvincing, so Labour Party vans toured the constituency playing her &quot;Today&quot; interview on loudspeakers.

Hartlepool had no significant ethnic minority vote, unlike the other three by-elections. The Liberal Democrats were nevertheless content to claim the large swing to them, and the Conservatives&#x27; fourth place established the Liberal Democrats as the main opposition party to Labour in the seat. UKIP did well with a local candidate, and its message of opposition to European Union fishing rules was a popular one in a port town.

The Conservative Party dropped from second place at the 2001 general election to fourth place, its worst place in an English by-election since 1991.

Labour believed its performance good, for it came at the end of a very long campaign (effectively seventy-one days), and with a swing markedly smaller than in other seats over the previous year; the party also regarded the result – along with that in Hodge Hill – as a vindication of its decision to aggressively attack the Liberal Democrats and essentially ignore the Conservative challenge.

<text>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, nonacid-fast, nonmotile bacterium. Distributed worldwide, &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; is primarily considered an animal pathogen, causing the disease known as erysipelas that may affect a wide range of animals. Pigs, turkeys and laying hens are most commonly affected, but cases have been reported in other mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles. In pigs, the disease is known as diamond skin disease. The bacterium can also cause zoonotic infections in humans, called erysipeloid. The human disease called erysipelas is not caused by &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;, but by various members of the genus &quot;Streptococcus&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; was first isolated by Robert Koch in 1876. A few years later the bacterium was recognised as the cause of erysipelas in pigs and in 1884 the organism was first established as a human pathogen. In 1909, the genus was named &quot;Erysipelothrix&quot;. In 1918 the name &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; was introduced and in 1920 it was designated as the type species of the genus.

==Epidemiology==
&quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; may be isolated from soil, food scraps, and water contaminated by infected animals. It can survive in soil for several weeks. In pig faeces, the survival period of this bacterium ranges from 1 to 5 months.
Erysipeloid is transmitted by several animals, particularly pigs, in which the disease (very common in the past) has several names (swine erysipelas in English, &quot;rouget du porc&quot; in French and &quot;mal rossino&quot; in Italian). Urticaria-like lesions, arthralgia, arthritis, endocarditis, and sepsis are the most characteristic features of swine erysipelas. Other animals that can transmit the infection are sheep, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, emus, scorpion fish, and lobsters.
Erysipeloid is an occupational disease, mainly found in animal breeders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, furriers, butchers, fishermen, fishmongers, housewives, cooks, and grocers. One epidemic of erysipeloid was described in workers involved in manufacturing buttons from animal bone. The disease is of economic importance to the pig industries of North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

==Clinical disease==
=== Humans ===
In humans, &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; infections most commonly present in a mild cutaneous form known as erysipeloid. Less commonly, it can result in sepsis; this scenario is often associated with endocarditis. Erysipeloid, also named in the past Rosenbach&#x27;s disease, Baker–Rosenbach disease, and pseudoerysipelas, is a bacterial infection of the skin caused by traumatic penetration of &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;.

It occurs most commonly as an occupational disease. The disease is characterized clinically by an erythematous oedema, with well-defined and raised borders, usually localized to the back of one hand and/or fingers. The palms, forearms, arms, face, and legs are rarely involved. Vesicular, bullous, and erosive lesions may also be present. The lesion may be asymptomatic or accompanied by mild pruritus, pain, and fever.

=== Animals ===
&quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot; may infect a wide range of animals, with or without causing the clinical disease that in animals is termed erysipelas.

==== Pigs ====
In pigs, three forms of erysipelas may be seen; acute, subacute or chronic. The acute form is characterised by high fever, anorexia, depression and death of one or more animals. Also, diamond-shaped cutaneous lesions may be seen, these are pathognomonic for erysipelas in pigs. During subacute erysipelas, similar but milder signs than in the acute form are seen. The chronic form may follow from acute or subacute cases or subclinical infections. The chronic form is mostly characterised by arthritis but sudden deaths, due to valvular lesions in the heart, may occur.

==== Poultry ====
The bacterium has been isolated from a wide range of avian species and differences in susceptibility depending on species have been suggested. Erysipelas outbreaks have been reported in almost all poultry species. Historically, erysipelas has been considered a disease of significant importance primarily in turkeys. However, an increasing number of outbreaks in laying hen flocks have been reported in several countries. Signs seen during an outbreak of erysipelas in a laying hen flock include sudden onset of high mortality and egg production losses.

===Muskox===
Due to unregulated hunting of muskox the species was almost wiped out in the late 19th century. However, by 1917 regulations were in place and the herds began to recover to such an extent that regulated hunting was permitted in the 1980s. By the 1990s hunters were permitted to take 10,000 muskox on Banks Island alone and in 2001 it was estimated that there were more than 68,000 muskox on the island making it the largest population in the world. However, since then the numbers have dropped by 70% due to &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;.

==Virulence factors==
Various virulence factors have been suggested as being involved in the pathogenicity of &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;. The presence of a hyaluronidase and neuraminidase has been recognized, and neuraminidase was shown to play a significant role in bacterial attachment and subsequent invasion into host cells. The role of hyaluronidase in the disease process is controversial. The presence of a heat-labile capsule has been reported as important in virulence.

==Diagnosis==

=== Isolation ===
Traditionally, culture methods for the isolation of &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; involve the use of selective and enrichment media. Commercially available blood culture media are satisfactory for primary isolation from blood, since &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; is not particularly fastidious. A number of selective media for the isolation of &quot;Erysipelothrix&quot; have been described, also. A commonly used medium is &quot;Erysipelothrix&quot; selective broth (ESB), a nutrient broth containing serum, tryptose, kanamycin, neomycin, and vancomycin. Modified blood azide medium (MBA) is a selective agar containing sodium azide and horse blood or serum. Packer&#x27;s medium is a selective medium for grossly contaminated specimens, which contains sodium azide and crystal violet. Bohm&#x27;s medium uses sodium azide, kanamycin, phenol, and water blue. Shimoji&#x27;s selective enrichment broth contains tryptic soy broth, Tween 80, tris-aminomethane, crystal violet, and sodium azide.

===Species identification===
Conventional species identification is based on colony morphology, Gram-staining and biochemical tests. Colonies are small with a narrow zone of alpha hemolysis on blood agar plates. Laboratory smears show Gram-positive rods (though Gram stain has low sensitivity for this microbe). It is nonmotile, catalase-negative, microaerophilic, capnophilic, and non-spore-forming. It can also produce H2S (gas), which is a unique characteristic for a Gram-positive bacillus. Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, galactose, and lactose, but not from maltose, xylose, and mannitol. Sucrose is fermented by most strains of &quot;E. tonsillarum&quot;, but not by &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;. Hydrogen sulfide H2S is produced by 95% of strains of &quot;Erysipelothrix&quot; species as demonstrated on triple sugar iron (TSI) agar. &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; can be differentiated from other Gram-positive bacilli, in particular, from &quot;Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) pyogenes&quot; and &quot;Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) haemolyticum&quot;, which are hemolytic on blood agar and do not produce hydrogen sulfide in TSI agar slants, and from &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, which is catalase positive, motile, and sensitive to neomycin. Rapid identification of &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; can be achieved with the API Coryne System. It is a commercial strip system based on a number of biochemical reactions for the identification of coryneform bacteria and related genera, including &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;. The system permits reliable and rapid identification of bacteria and has been considered to be a good alternative to traditional biochemical methods.

=== Other assays ===
Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods have also been developed for detection of &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot;.
Laboratory investigations of humans may reveal leucocytosis, slightly increased serum c-globulins, and an increase in inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and a-1 acid glycoprotein).

==Treatment==
=== Humans ===
Penicillin is the treatment of choice for both disease states in humans. &quot;E. rhusiopathiae&quot; is sensitive &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; mainly to penicillins, but also to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin), clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, and piperacillin. It is resistant to vancomycin, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, gentamicin, netilmicin, polymyxin B, streptomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Penicillins and cephalosporins are the first-line choices for treatment. A 7-day course is appropriate, and clinical improvement is usually observed 2–3 days after the beginning of the treatment.

=== Poultry ===
Only a few poultry isolates have been investigated for antimicrobial susceptibility. Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of poultry, however the disease may reoccur. Therefore, antibiotic treatment may be combined with vaccination.

<doc id="851693" wikidata="Q16201617" url="?curid=851693" title="The Good Son (Frasier)">
<text>&quot;The Good Son&quot; is the pilot episode of the television sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;. It aired on September 16, 1993, on NBC. It introduces the primary characters and settings, and distances itself from its parent series &quot;Cheers&quot;.

The final draft of the script was published on April 29, 1993. Excerpts from the show were promoted as the series finale of &quot;Cheers&quot; aired on May 20, 1993. This episode set up a number of recurring gags for the series, such as Martin&#x27;s Lazyboy recliner and the unseen character of Maris Crane, Niles&#x27; wife.

==Plot==
Six months after the conclusion of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Dr. Frasier Crane is divorced from Lilith Sternin and has moved back to his hometown of Seattle, Washington, looking for a fresh start. Since the move, Frasier has been hosting a talk-radio show on KACL 780 AM Talk Radio as an on-air psychiatrist, alongside producer Roz Doyle.

Frasier is approached by his brother, Niles, who informs him that their father, Martin, a retired police officer injured in the line of duty, can no longer live by himself due to his injuries. In hopes of renewing their father-son relationship, Frasier offers to take his father in.

Martin moves into Frasier&#x27;s apartment but Martin brings in his thread-bare recliner and Parson Russell Terrier Eddie, both of which greatly upset Frasier. Some time afterwards, Niles and his unseen wife, Maris, offer to help Frasier take care of Martin by jointly paying for a health care provider. Martin convinces Frasier to hire Daphne Moon, an eccentric immigrant from Manchester, England, who claims to be &quot;a bit psychic&quot;, much to Frasier&#x27;s displeasure. After Daphne says she needs to move in, Frasier, who doesn&#x27;t want more people living in his apartment, rejects her. This leads to an argument with Martin, which ends with Frasier walking out of the apartment.

The next day at work, Frasier confides his troubles to Roz. She tells him the story of Lupe Vélez, pointing out that although things might not go as planned, they can work out anyway. Frasier then takes his next call, only to find an apologetic Martin on the line. Frasier then reconciles with his father. The next call is from a woman, upset and tearful about breaking up with her boyfriend. Frasier proceeds to tell her the story of Vélez. The episode ends with Daphne, Martin, and Frasier watching TV in his apartment in the evening while Eddie silently stares at a disturbed Frasier.

==Awards==
* David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee won the Primetime Emmy Award for writing this episode.
* James Burrows won the Directors Guild of America Award and the Primetime Emmy Award for directing this episode.
* For his performance in this episode, Kelsey Grammer won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. This was his second nomination in this category and his first win.

<text>Metal Gear Acid (stylized as Metal Gear Ac!d) is a turn-based collectible card tactical RPG video game developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan for the PlayStation Portable. The game was first unveiled at E3 in May 2004, and was released in Japan on December 16, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005. It was a launch title for the PSP. A Java ME version for mobile phones was released by Glu Mobile in 2008 titled &quot;Metal Gear Acid Mobile&quot;.

&quot;Acid&quot; focuses on turn-based tactics, using a trading card-based system to control the main character&#x27;s movements and actions. &quot;Acid&quot; in the name stands for &quot;Active Command Intelligence Duel&quot;. The cards are not truly collectible, as the game is complete with a single purchase. However, the game does feature deck design and deck optimization elements. The game allows for multiplayer gameplay by wireless ad-hoc connections of two PSPs.

Before each round, the player can customize the deck of cards used by the main characters. The majority of the cards are based upon elements spanning the entire &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, such as weaponry, characters, and even the Metal Gear itself. When the game is started, the player&#x27;s hand can consist of a maximum of six cards. The maximum number of cards in a deck increases with overall progress. In action mode, the player can choose to use the cards as they are intended or use them to move the character. Most cards only allow the player to move three spaces, while certain cards let the player move up to six or higher.

Cost is an important factor in game play and can be summed up as the weight of the player&#x27;s action. With some exceptions, all cards have a cost attached to them and when used this cost transfers to the player. Cost varies radically from card to card. The higher the cost a character has, the longer that character must wait until their next turn. The lower the cost a character has, the shorter that character must wait until their next turn. For example: if a player character has a cost of 10 and a guard has a cost of 15, then the character&#x27;s turn would occur before the guard&#x27;s.

Some cards can be equipped; cards such as weapon cards, can have other cards attached to them in order to improve performance. In order to fire the weapon, another weapon card that uses the same kind of ammunition must be equipped. Some weapons don&#x27;t need to be equipped and can be used by themselves, however they are discarded afterwards. Other cards that can be equipped include equipment cards and action cards.

Multiplayer, or &quot;Link Battle&quot;, is also a new feature. Two PSP systems running &quot;Acid&quot; can link wirelessly, allowing players to face each other in a &quot;sneak-off&quot;. The objective is to collect a certain number of diskettes before the rival player. Diskettes can be stolen by another player, so there is an emphasis on avoiding detection.

== Plot ==

===Story===
In 2016, a jumbo jet carrying Senator Hach, an important politician and likely future presidential candidate, is hijacked by terrorists. In exchange for the senator the terrorists demand from the United States government Pythagoras, a research project being conducted in the Moloni Republic in southern Africa. In efforts to identify these terrorists, the government begins an investigation of Pythagoras.

The Moloni government refuses to cooperate and work with the United States, saying that it doesn&#x27;t want to interfere in its current affairs. In response, the US sends in a covert special forces team to investigate, but the team is obliterated by armed resistance. With no other options and time running out, the US government calls Solid Snake to infiltrate the laboratory, discover the nature of Pythagoras, and to rescue Senator Hach.

=== Characters ===
* Solid Snake - The main character. A member of FOXHOUND who has achieved legendary status, he is brought to duty to infiltrate the Lobito Physics and Chemistry laboratory compound. Snake is led to believe that he is actually Hans Davis, a researcher involved in the development of the new Metal Gear model.
* Teliko Friedman - A female Japanese-American member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Hostage Rescue Team that was sent to the Lobito compound prior to Snake. She rendezvous with Snake and teams up with him as a second playable character in the game. She reappears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot; as a hidden playable character.
* Roger McCoy - A Central Intelligence Agency operative from New Jersey who serves as Snake&#x27;s commanding officer in the game. He previously served in the Green Berets and is an acquaintance of Roy Campbell, Snake&#x27;s former commanding officer.
* Alice Hazel - An English girl who has aided the FBI and CIA in the past with her psychic abilities. She is one of Snake&#x27;s radio contacts in the game.
* Lt. Leone - The leader of a mercenary group hired by an anti-government militia in the Moloni Republic. He was once known as Jeff Jones and served under McCoy&#x27;s unit during the Vietnam War until he was suspected of treason.
* Gary Murray - A lab worker who requests Snake&#x27;s help. He is actually William L. Flemming and is involved in the development of the new Metal Gear.
* Elsie and Frances - A pair of marionettes that carry out the hijacking of Flight 326.
* La Clown - An assassin of unknown gender with the ability to disguise their appearance.
* Viggo Hach - A Dutch-American United States Senator from New York who is a presidential candidate. Taken hostage by terrorists during his flight.
* Lena Arrows - Hach&#x27;s secretary, who was also caught in the hijacking.
* Minette Donnell - A young girl on the same flight as Hach. She is actually Constance Flemming, the daughter of William L. Flemming.
* Charles Schmeiser - A CIA agent from Toronto, Canada who works under McCoy.

== Production and release ==
According to an interview originally published by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; with the game&#x27;s producer, Masahiro Hinami, the &#x27;Acid&#x27; part of the title actually has three different meanings. The first meaning refers to &quot;Acid&#x27;s&quot; departure from the previous &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games in terms of style, which is an analogue to acid&#x27;s ability to dissolve metal. The second is a reference to vecuronium bromide, the chemical used by Elsie and Frances to hijack Flight 326. The third is stated to be an acronym for Active Command Intelligence Duel, a reference to the game&#x27;s mixture of turn-based tactics with card-based gameplay.

===Soundtrack===
The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Nobuko Toda, Shuichi Kobori and Akihiro Honda. The soundtrack was released on December 21, 2005, packaged with the &quot;Metal Gear Acid 2&quot; soundtrack. The album&#x27;s title is &quot;Metal Gear Acid 1 and 2 Original Soundtrack,&quot; the first disc of the album featuring the music from the first Metal Gear Acid title&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; received somewhat positive reviews from critics, citing the game&#x27;s unique mechanics and turn-based stealth. The game holds a 75 on Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. IGN gave it a 6.5/10, calling the game&#x27;s story &quot;contrived&quot;, and referencing the occasionally frustrating gameplay while praising some elements.

== Sequel ==
&quot;Acid&quot; was followed by a sequel for the PSP, &quot;Metal Gear Acid 2&quot;, which released the following year. A mobile phone version, titled &quot;Metal Gear Acid Mobile&quot; was also produced.

<text>A car platform is a shared set of common design, engineering, and production efforts, as well as major components, over a number of outwardly distinct models and even types of cars, often from different, but somewhat related, marques. It is practiced in the automotive industry to reduce the costs associated with the development of products by basing those products on a smaller number of platforms. This further allows companies to create distinct models from a design perspective on similar underpinnings. A car platform is not to be confused with a platform chassis, although such a chassis can be part of an automobile&#x27;s design platform, as noted below.

== Definition and benefits ==
A basic definition of a platform in cars, from a technical point of view, includes underbody and suspensions (with axles) — where the underbody is made of the front floor, rear floor, engine compartment, and frame (reinforcement of underbody). Key mechanical components that define an automobile platform include:
* The floorpan, which serves as a foundation for the chassis and other structural and mechanical components
* Front and rear axles and the distance between them - wheelbase
* Steering mechanism and type of power steering
* Type of front and rear suspensions
* Placement and choice of engine and other powertrain components

Platform sharing is a product development method where different products and the brand attached share the same components. The purpose with platform sharing is to reduce the cost and have a more efficient product development process. The companies gain on reduced procurement costs by taking advantage of the commonality of the components. However, this also limits their ability to differentiate the products and imposes a risk of losing the tangible uniqueness of the product. The companies have to make a trade-off between reducing their development costs and the degree of differentiation of the products.

=== Characteristics of a joint platform ===
Platform sharing is a practice commonly employed by various brands within a corporate group. The fundamental components of a shared platform typically include the chassis and the drive unit. The extent to which different automobile or motorcycle models utilize the same components can vary, leading to different degrees of structural equality and platform similarity:

* Structural equality: In the context of structural equality, the differences between vehicles are minimal. Only the brand logo, front fairing, fuel tank, and, where applicable, headlights and rear lights, are distinct. Vehicles with structural equality are often produced on the same assembly line.
* Same platform: When vehicles share the same platform, different fairings attach to the same fixation points, allowing for the easy interchange of components such as the fork, wing, engine, and transmission.
The remaining vehicle parts are categorised into &quot;head&quot; parts and system parts:

* Head Parts: These include components like the bodywork or fuel tank, which can vary significantly between models.
* System Parts: Also known as Carry Over Parts (COP), these are common parts that are replicated and adapted to different models. Examples include wheels or chassis components that are identical across different models, with only minor variations like model symbols.

Platform sharing facilitates the efficient production and development of vehicles by leveraging common components across different models, thereby reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency.

===Platform sharing among brands===
One of the first car companies to use this product development approach was General Motors in 1908. General Motors used a single chassis for certain class of model across most of its brands like Chevrolet, Buick, Pontiac and Oldsmobile. Later, Chrysler Corporation would do the same for Plymouth, DeSoto and Dodge cars. Ford followed the same principle for Ford and Mercury in US markets.
The chassis unit was common with many shared mechanical components while the exterior styling and interior trims were designed according to its individual brand and category.

=== Multiple body variants ===
In recent years for monocoque chassis, platform-sharing combined with advanced and flexible-manufacturing technology enabled automakers to sharply reduce product development and changeover times, while modular design and assembly allow building a greater variety of vehicles from one basic set of engineered components. Pictured below is the Nissan MS platform, where designs including 5-door hatchback, sedan, compact SUV and minivan were built on a common floor panel and many shared functional assemblies such as engine, transmission and chassis components.

Many vendors refer to this as product or vehicle architecture. The concept of product architecture is the scheme by which the function of a product is allocated to physical components.

The use of a platform strategy provides several benefits:
* Greater flexibility across plants (the possibility of transferring production from one plant to another due to standardization)
* Cost reduction through using resources on a global scale
* Increased utilization of plants (higher productivity due to the reduction in the number of differences)
* Reduction of the number of platforms as a result of their localization on a worldwide basis

The car platform strategy has become important in new product development and in the innovation process. The finished products have to be responsive to market needs and to demonstrate distinctiveness while – at the same time – they must be developed and produced at low cost. Adopting such a strategy affects the development process and also has an important impact on an automaker&#x27;s organizational structure. A platform strategy also offers advantages for the globalization process of automobile firms.

Because automakers spend the majority of time and money on the development of platforms, platform sharing affords manufacturers the ability to cut costs on research and development by spreading it over several product lines. Manufacturers are then able to offer products at a lower cost to consumers. Additionally, economies of scale are increased, as is return on investment.

== Examples ==
===Early examples===
Originally, a &quot;platform&quot; was a literally shared chassis from a previously-engineered vehicle, as in the case for the Citroën 2CV platform chassis used by the Citroën Ami and Citroën Dyane, as well as the Volkswagen Beetle frame under the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. These two manufacturers made different category of vehicles under using the same chassis design at different years though the primary vehicle was still in production.

In the United States, platform sharing has been a common practice since the 1960s. This was when GM used the same platform in the development of the Pontiac LeMans, the Buick Skylark, the Chevrolet Chevelle, and the Oldsmobile Cutlass.

In the 1980s, Chrysler&#x27;s K-cars all wore a badge with the letter &quot;K&quot; to indicate their shared platform. In later stages, the &quot;K&quot; platform was extended in wheelbase, as well as use for several of the Corporation&#x27;s different models. In the same decade, Fiat and Saab jointly developed cars using the Type Four platform to compete with the German-dominated European executive car segment.

General Motors used similar strategies with its &quot;J&quot; platform that debuted in mid-1981 in four of GM&#x27;s divisions. Subsequently, GM introduced its &quot;A&quot; bodies for the same four divisions using the same tread width/wheelbase of the &quot;X&quot; body platform, but with larger bodywork to make the cars seem larger, and with larger trunk compartments. They were popular through the 1980s, primarily. Even Cadillac started offering a &quot;J&quot; body model called the Cimarron, a much gussied-up version of the other four brands&#x27; platform siblings.

A similar strategy applied to what is known as the N-J-L platform, arguably the most prolific of GM&#x27;s efforts on one platform. Once more, GM&#x27;s four lower-level divisions all offered various models on this platform throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.

The 1988 Fiat Tipo was one of the first European cars utilizing a modular platform, also used for the Fiat Tempra.

===Recent years===
Japanese carmakers have followed the platform sharing practice with Honda&#x27;s Acura line, Nissan&#x27;s Infiniti brand, and Toyota&#x27;s Lexus marque, as the entry-level luxury models are based on their mainstream lineup. For example, the Lexus ES is essentially an upgraded and rebadged Toyota Camry. After Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler, Chrysler engineers used several M-B platforms for new models including the Crossfire which was based on the M-B SLK roadster. Other models that share platforms are the European Ford Focus, Mazda 3, and the Volvo S40.

Differences between shared models typically involve styling, including headlights, tail lights, and front and rear fascias. Examples also involve differing engines and drivetrains. In some cases such as the Lexus ES that is a Toyota Camry, &quot;same car, same blueprints, same skeleton off the same assembly line in the same factory&quot;, but the Lexus is marketed with premium coffee in the dealership&#x27;s showroom and reduced greens fees at Pebble Beach Golf Links as part of the higher-priced badge.

Platform sharing &quot;may&quot; be less noticeable now; however, it is still very apparent. Vehicle architectures primarily consist of &quot;under the skin&quot; components, and shared platforms can show up in unusual places, like the Nissan FM platform-mates Nissan 350Z marketed as a sports car and Infiniti FX positioned as a SUV. The Volkswagen A platform-mates such as the sports-oriented Audi TT and the economy-focused Volkswagen Golf also share much of their mechanical components but are visually entirely different. Both the Volkswagen Group and Toyota have had much success building many well-differentiated vehicles from many marques, from the same platforms. One of the least conspicuous recent examples is the Chevy Trailblazer and Chevy SSR; both use the GMT-360 platform.

== Advantages ==
;Easier inventory management/smaller number of parts
:Platform sharing allows for fewer parts for different models of vehicles and therefore the task of inventorying those parts is greatly reduced.
;Lower development costs
:Platform sharing allows manufacturers to cover many different market segments when a platform sharing strategy is implemented. This is exemplified by Ford in the case of the Ford Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer, and Lincoln Aviator. They are essentially the same vehicles, but they are targeted as being in the mass-market, near luxury, and luxury vehicles segments.
;Increased quality and innovation
:Platform sharing allows manufacturers to design parts with fewer variation. A byproduct of this is increased quality, which results in lower defect rates.
;Global standardization
:Platform sharing allows manufacturers to design flexible platforms that can be tailored to a country&#x27;s specific needs without compromising quality. It also allows for manufacturing standardization and improved logistics.
;Greater product variety
:Platform sharing allows manufacturers to build/design differentiated products faster and cheaper. This is possible because the development and cost of the original platform have already been paid for.

== Disadvantages ==
;Badge engineering
:Manufacturers that practice platform sharing have the ability to create several models based on the same design but with different names. This leads to the public looking over certain models and cannibalized sales from competing automakers with essentially similar products. This was prevalent among U.S. domestic manufactures from the 1970s onward, e.g., the Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X, Oldsmobile Bravada, and Isuzu Ascender.
;Incompatible changes to platforms
:The two elements of platforms are constant and non-constant. If the non-constant elements are not designed to be easily integrated into the constant elements of the platform, extensive and expensive changes will have to be made in order to make the elements compatible again. Failure to do so negates the purpose of platform sharing in that it increases costs as opposed to reducing them.
;Product dilution
:Platform sharing has the ability to be used in too many different models. However, in the minds of the consumers, the products may be too similar and more expensive products may be perceived to be cheaper. For example, the perceived value of a &quot;luxury&quot; brand may be not as desirable if it is too similar to a mass-market version of the same platform. Conversely, platform sharing may increase the price of the economic models. Examples of luxury vehicles that suffered from being based on economy platforms include the Cadillac Cimarron, the Chrysler TC by Maserati (similar to the K-platform, though it was actually built on a different and unique Q-platform), the Maybach 57 and 62 and the Jaguar X-Type.
;Risk concentration/higher recall rate
:The propensity for a higher number of recall is greatly increased with platform sharing. If a defect is found in one model and that model shares its platform with nine other models, the recall would be magnified by ten thus costing the manufacturer more time and money to fix. An example of problems spreading across platforms and numerous versions of models are the 2009–11 Toyota vehicle recalls.

==Top hat==
In automotive design, the top hat is one or more vehicle upper body structures that can share a common platform. The upper body could vary from a crossover to a sedan or coupe thereby creating economies of scale and product differentiation.

<text>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), also known as intracranial bleed, is bleeding within the skull. Subtypes are intracerebral bleeds (intraventricular bleeds and intraparenchymal bleeds), subarachnoid bleeds, epidural bleeds, and subdural bleeds.
Intracerebral bleeding affects 2.5 per 10,000 people each year.
==Signs and symptoms==
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in intracranial pressure, which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply. Severe increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause brain herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull.

Symptoms include severe headache, nausea/vomiting, seizures, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, one-sided facial drooping, one-sided numbness, weakness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, blindness, deafness, memory issues, attention problems, balance problems, coordination problems and decreasing level of consciousness or complete loss of consciousness. Coma and persistent vegetative state can result from intracranial hemorrhage. 

Brain stem hemorrhage may cause additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), chewing problems, abnormal heart rate, and irregular heartbeat. Brain stem hemorrhage can cause cardiac arrest.

==Causes==

Trauma is the most common cause of intracranial hemorrhage. It can cause epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other condition such as hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion and cerebral microhemorrhages can also be caused by trauma.

Non-traumatic causes of hemorrhage includes: hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic infarction, cerebral aneurysms, dural arteriovenous fistulae, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral vasculitis and mycotic aneurysm.

More than half of all cases of intracranial hemorrhage are the result of hypertension.

==Diagnosis==

CT scan (computed tomography) of the brain (without any iodinated contrast), is the initial imaging choice because of its high speed, good accessibility in hospitals, high sensitivity in detecting brain injuries or brain diseases, thus helping to triage patients in emergency department in a timely manner and urgent neurosurgical intervention can be administered. Examples of brain diseases that require urgent intervention are: large volume hemorrhage, brain herniation, and cerebral infarction. Other advantages of CT over MRI scan are ability to detect bony fractures, vascular injury, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. It also does not need to screen for MRI safety of implants/foreign body especially for penetrating or blast injuries. Moreover, CT scans have also been used to train deep learning models to automatically perform intracranial hemorrhage detection. Deep learning models have been found to reach expert-level performance.

However, MRI has higher sensitivity than CT scan for the detection of epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, nonhemorrhagic cortical contusions, hemorrhagic parenchymal contusions, brainstem injuries, and white matter axonal injuries. If CT scan shows normal findings, but the subject has persistent neurological symptoms, MRI is also indicated. However, MRI safety concerns on metallic foreign bodies, limited availability, longer imaging time, high sensitivity to motion, and higher cost limits the usefulness of MRI.

Swirl sign on CT scan (areas of low densities with surrounding areas of high densities) is indicative of active intracranial bleeding, high chance of death within one month, and poor subject&#x27;s function in three months if the subject is still alive.

When ICP is increased the heart rate may be decreased.

==Traumatic==
Types of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial. Intra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or cerebral hemorrhage. This category includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or bleeding within the brain itself, and intraventricular hemorrhage, bleeding within the brain&#x27;s ventricles (particularly of premature infants). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds. Hemorrhagic parenchymal contusions and cerebral microhemorrhages are examples of traumatic intra-axial bleeds.

Extra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes: epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

===Hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion===

This condition most commonly occurred in those with significant head movement or head impact. It is caused by injuries of small arterial or venous vessels, causing hemorrhage within the brain parenchyma, and give rise to hyperdense lesion on CT scan. MRI is more sensitive than CT scan in detecting such small hemorrhagic contusions, with the use of gradient echo sequence. Contusions are more commonly seen in the brain parenchyma near base of the skull such as inferior frontal lobes and temporal lobes as a result of Coup contrecoup injury. Those with parenchymal contusion would require frequent follow-up imaging because such contusions may grow large enough to become hemorrhage and exerts significant mass effect on the brain.

Cerebral microhemorrhages is a smaller form of hemorrhagic parenchymal contusion and are typically found in white matter. Such microhemorrhages are difficult to be detected on CT scan, but easily detected on gradient echo and susceptibility weighted imaging on MRI scan as hypointense susceptibility blooming. Such microhemorrhages are frequently associated with diffuse axonal injury and located near the grey-white matter junction.

===Epidural hemorrhage===
Epidural hemorrhage (extradural hemorrhage, EDH) which occur between the dura mater (the outermost meningeal layer) and the skull, is caused by trauma. It does not cross the suture lines of the skull because the superifical dural layer is attached tightly to the skull along the suture lines. Unless rarely, fracture involves the suture lines (more common in children), then epidural hematoma may cross the suture lines. As the blood accumulated in the epidural space is confined within suture lines, accumulation of additional blood will cause bulging in this space, and thus resulting in a typical &quot;biconvex&quot; appearance on CT scans. EDH can be due to arterial or venous rupture depending on the locations. Arterial injuries results in more rapidly growing hematoma when compared to venous injuries. At the pterion region, middle meningeal artery is most commonly affected. When fracture is crossing areas where dural venous sinuses resides, venous hemorrhage can occur such as falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, and vertex (where superior sagittal sinus resides). Anterior temporal EDH is usually caused by sphenoparietal sinus. Such EDH is limited and does not require surgery because its extension is confined within the sphenosquamosal suture and the superior or inferior orbital fissures. In 20 to 50% of epidural hemorrhage cases, there is a lucid interval during which the patient regains consciousness after being knocked unconscious; this is then followed by deterioration of conscious state.

When the epidural hematoma is large enough, it will cause mass effect on contralateral brain which lead to midline, subfalcine (below the falx cerebri), and trans-tentorial (crossing tentorium cerebelli) herniations. This phenomenon can cause the subject to lose consciousness and eventually to death. Therefore, large EDH requires emergent surgical clot evacuation. Embolisation of middle meningeal artery is performed if the hemorrhage is medium or small.

===Subdural hemorrhage===
Subdural hemorrhage (SDH) results from tearing of the bridging veins in the subdural space between the dura and arachnoid mater. It can cross the suture lines, but not across dural reflections such as falx cerebri or tentorium cerebelli. Therefore, subdural hematoma always limited to one side of the brain. Density of SDH reduces as it progresses from acute to chronic forms. However, areas with low density may not represent chronic SDH entirely as unclotted blood products that are due to active bleed can also give low density appearance on CT scans especially those with coagulopathy. Those with SDH that have same density with brain parenchyma may represent acute bleed such as those with anemia, arachnoid tear, and the mixing of hemorrhage and CSF. SDH usually have high or mixed densities during first two days of trauma, followed by isodensity at 11 days after trauma, and hypodensity after 14 days of trauma. Membranes with granulation tissue can rupture within SDH, and give high density appearance on CT scan. Over a prolonged period of time, calcifications can form. SDH can be treated with burr hole drainage, craniotomy or port system placement for blood clot evacuation, or middle meningeal artery embolisation.

Subdural hematoma maybe less acute than epidural hematoma due to slower blood accumulation, but it still has the potential to cause brain herniation that may require surgical evacuation. Clinical features depend on the site of injury and severity of injury. Patients may have a history of loss of consciousness but they recover and do not relapse. Clinical onset occurs over hours. Complications include focal neurologic deficits depending on the site of hematoma and brain injury, increased intracranial pressure leading to herniation of brain and ischemia due to reduced blood supply and seizures.

===Subarachnoid hemorrhage===

A &quot;subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot; (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid space—the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Trauma can also cause SAH when the arteries and veins coursing through the subarachnoid space are ruptured. It is usually located at the cerebral sulci near the vertex of the head and spare the basal cisterns on CT scan. Severe trauma can cause SAH in all parts of the brain. When the SAH volume is large, rarely it can cause cerebral infarction a few days after trauma due to arterial vasospasm. Although CT scan is performed more often than MRI to detect SAH, MRI is more sensitive than CT in this aspect. SAH shows hyperintense signal of Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and blooming artifact on susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).

Computed tomography angiography (CT angiography) or Magnetic resonance angiography (MR angiography) should be done if fracture involves the carotid canal, because in such cases, posttraumatic vasospasm can occur, thus cutting blood supply to the brain. Besides, intracranial hemorrhage that are atypical for trauma should also be investigated further with CT or MR angiography to look for other causes of intracranial bleeds apart from trauma causes. Such atypical patterns includes: isolated SAH in the basal cisterns, isolated large-volume SAH in the Sylvian fissure, and isolated SAH in the anterior interhemispheric fissure. These cases warrants investigations to look for aneurysms that can cause such bleeding.

==Non-traumatic==
===Hypertensive bleed===

Intracranial bleed in hypertensive subjects usually occurs at 50 to 60 years of life with 30 to 50% chance of death. Such hemorrhages are typically located in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, or occipital lobes. Other location such as bleed within the cerebral cortex and intracranial bleed in people younger than 50 years should prompt further investigations on other causes of bleed such as brain tumour or cerebral arteriovenous malformation. The bleed can be very small without any significant effect on surrounding brain or large hemorrhage that exerts mass effect on adjacent brain. Follow up CT scan is recommended. Those with extension of bleed into the ventricular system, expansion of bleeding, or increasing cerebral oedema on CT scan gives poorer prognosis. CT angiography (CTA) of brain can be performed to investigate the source of bleeding. An image during the delayed phase of the CTA may be taken to look for pooling of contrast that signifies active bleeding (known as &quot;Spot sign&quot;). Presence of &quot;Spot sign&quot; signifies poor clinical outcome for the subject.

===Cerebral amyloid angiopathy===

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the deposition of Amyloid beta peptide protein within the brain. Accumulation of such peptide proteins within the walls of the arteries can cause weakening of the walls and causes microhemorrhages, SAH within the cerebral sulci or large cerebral intraparenchymal bleed. SAH in CAA can be differentiated from vasculitis by its presentations. SAH in CAA usually occurs in those who age more than 60 years, temporary motor and sensory deficits, and intracranial bleed in white matter adjacent to cerebral cortex. Basal ganglia, posterior fossa, and brainstem are spared. Boston criteria is used to determine the likelihood of a cerebral hemorrhage due to CAA. Definitive diagnosis of CAA is by performing brain biopsy

CT scan may show hyperdense intra-axial hemorrhage in the subcortical region. Diffuse white matter hypodensities in both cerebral hemispheres may represents microangiopathic changes. On MRI these lesions will be presented as blooming artifact on gradient echo and susceptibility weighted imaging.

===Hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic infarction===
43% of those with infarcted brain tissue will develop hemorrhagic conversion. Risk of hemorrhagic is further increased with recanalisation of veins or arteries. Several types of hemorrhages can occur such as petechial hemorrhages around the infarcted margin (HI1), confluent petechial hemorrhages within the infarcted tissue (HI2), hematoma occupying less than 30% of the infarcted tissue (PH1), hematoma involving greater than 30% of infarcted tissue with small mass effect (PH2), and hematoma involving greater than 30% of the infarcted tissue with significant mass effect. However, only PH2 is clinically significant. Those who has infarction should be monitored frequently with CT brains to access hemorrhagic conversions or worsening vasogenic oedema that may require neurosurgical decompression. Dual energy CT scan maybe useful to differentiate the high densities caused by reperfusion hemorrhage (bleeding after endovascular stroke treatment) and high density due to iodinated contrast administered during cerebral angiography.

===Cerebral aneurysm===

Besides from head injury, it may occur spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm (focal outpouchings with weakened walls on the arteries on the brain surface that are prone to rupture). Symptoms of SAH include a severe headache with a rapid onset (thunderclap headache), vomiting, confusion or a lowered level of consciousness, and sometimes seizures. CT scan has 100% sensitivity of detecting SAH at 6 to 24 hours after symptoms onset. The diagnosis is generally confirmed with a CT scan of the head. If CT scan is normal but SAH is still strongly suspected, lumbar puncture can be done at six to twelfth hours after the onset of headache. This is to determine the presence of blood within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Those with SAH will have blood and bilirubin within their CSF because of the degradation of their red blood cells. Meanwhile, those who has blood within CSF due to traumatic lumbar puncture will not have bilirubin within CSF. SAH is generally located within basal cisterns, extends diffusely to all subarachnoid spaces (cerebral sulci) or into the ventricular system, or brain parenchyma. Modified Fisher scale is used to describe the volume and distribution of SAH, just predicting the probability of cerebral artery vasospasm after SAH.

Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications. Since the 1990s, many aneurysms are treated by a minimal invasive procedure known as endovascular coiling, which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels. However, this procedure has higher recurrence rates than the more invasive craniotomy with clipping.

===Cerebral ateriovenous malformation===

Cerebral ateriovenous malformation (Cerebral AVM) is characterised by abnormal shunting between cerebral arteries and veins without going through capillaries. Instead the blood goes through a collection of small vessels from arteries to veins. These collection of abnormal small vessels is termed as &quot;nidus&quot;. This condition happens in 0.1% of the population has a risk of 2 to 4% per year for intracranial bleeding. Once ruptured, it results in intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage and SAH. Rupture of cerebral AVM often occurs in young people and children. Cerebral AVM can be diagnosed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) brain, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) brain, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). DSA is important to determine whether there is nidal or perinidal aneurysm.

===Dural arteriovenous fistulae===

Dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) is the direct connection between dural or cerebral arteries with dural venous sinuses or cortical veins. It accounts for 10 to 15% of intracranial arteriovenous shunts. DAVF lacks a nidus. Signs and symptoms of DAVF are: headache, tinnitus, neurological deficits involving cranial nerves, and increased intracranial pressure. DAVF once ruptured, will produce intraparenchymal hemorrhage or SAH. Increase in number of vessels near dural venous sinuses as seen on CTA is suggestive of DVAF. 4DCT may increase the sensitivity of detecting DAVF. In MRI scans, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and arterial spin labelling sequences (labelling protons in blood without the use of contrast media to determine blood flow) are useful in evaluating DAVF. The patterns of draining veins from the fistula determines the risk of DAVF rupture. Increased pressure within the dural venous sinuses causes backpressure into the cortical veins, thus making cortical veins more prone to rupture. The risk of hemorrhage is graded by Cognard and Borden grading systems. These grading systems are based upon the DSA.

===Cortical venous/cerebral venous sinus thrombosis===

Dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST) and cortical venous thrombosis (CVT) commonly presents with headache, increased intracranial pressure, or seizures. DVST is more common than CVT. DVST are frequently caused by infections in the skull base, dehydration, thrombophilia, meningioma, and other dural tumours. On CT scans, brain parenchymal hemorrhage that does not confined to specific arterial territory along with hyperdense appearance on dural venous sinuses raises the suspicion of DVST. Further evaluation with CT venography, MR venography, and post gadolinium MRI provides accurate diagnosis of venous thrombosis and follow-up after treatment. These studies demonstrate thrombus as filling defect or lack of signal.

===Vasculitis/vasculopathy===

Those with vasculitis may be presented with headache, behavioural changes, neurological deficits, or intracranial bleeding. Sulcal SAH is the most common form of intracranial bleed caused by vasculitis. On CT scans, sulcal SAH is seen as hyperdensity within the cerebral sulcus, while on MRI, it is seen as hyperintensity on FLAIR sequence, and hypointensity on GRE/SWI sequence. DSA is important in making the diagnosis of vasculitis or vasculopathy.

===Mycotic aneurysm===

It is arterial outpouchings arise from distal cerebral arteries. These are pseudoaneurysm, caused by thrombus clogging the distal arteries, which results in inflammation and small tears at the site of occlusion. These inflammation and thrombis can caused by infective endocarditis, artificial heart valve or other heart problems. Similar to vasculitis, rupture of mycotic aneurysm also causes SAH in cerebral sulci, mostly located in the vertex. If mycotic aneurysm is located more proximally, it will produce diffuse SAH pattern. CTA or MRA would produce focal outpouching or increase in diameter of the vessel. Meanwhile, GRE/SWI MRI sequence would produce focal hypointensity. Small mycotic aneurysms are difficult to be seen on CT or MRI. Thus, DSA is useful in identifying these lesions.

==Management==
For those who is already on blood thinners such as aspirin or clopidogrel for prevention of myocardial infarction or stroke, traumatic intracranial hemorrhage should prompt the use of platelet function assays (PFA-100) to assess the effect of these antiplalelet agents. After that, plateletpheresis can be started to increase the aggregation of platelets, thus stopping the intracranial bleed. In those with impaired kidney functions, desmopressin or cryoprecipitate can be used instead.

From limited observational data, it may be relatively safe to restart blood thinners after an ICH as it is associated with reduced thromboembolic complications with similar risk of recurrent hemorrhage when compared to those did not start blood thinners after an ICH.

<text>Tugtupite is a beryllium aluminium tectosilicate. It also contains sodium and chlorine and has the formula Na4AlBeSi4O12Cl. Tugtupite is a member of the silica-deficient feldspathoid mineral group. It occurs in high alkali intrusive igneous rocks.

Tugtupite is tenebrescent, sharing much of its crystal structure with sodalite, and the two minerals are occasionally found together in the same sample.

Tugtupite occurs as vitreous, transparent to translucent masses of tetragonal crystals and is commonly found in white, pink, to crimson, and even blue and green. It has a Mohs hardness of 4 and a specific gravity of 2.36. It fluoresces crimson under ultraviolet radiation.

It was first found in 1962 at Tugtup agtakôrfia Ilimaussaq intrusive complex of southwest Greenland. It has also been found at Mont-Saint-Hilaire in Quebec and in the Lovozero Massif of the Kola Peninsula in Russia

The name is derived from the Greenlandic Inuit word for reindeer (&quot;tuttu&quot;), and means &quot;reindeer blood&quot;.

The U.S. Geological Survey reports that in Nepal, tugtupite (as well as jasper and nephrite) were found extensively in most of the rivers from the Bardia to the Dang.

It is used as a gemstone.

<doc id="851717" wikidata="Q5378815" url="?curid=851717" title="Enharmonic scale">
<text>In music theory, an enharmonic scale is a &quot;very&quot; ancient Greek musical scale which contains four notes tuned to approximately quarter tone pitches, bracketed (as pairs) between four fixed pitches. For example, in modern microtonal notation, one of the several enharmonic scales aligned with the conventional key of C major would be
: (0¢), (400¢), (450¢), (500¢),
: (700¢), (1000¢), (1150 ¢), (1200¢).

The symbol in this example represents a half-sharp, or sharpening by a quartertone (50cents), although raising pitch by exactly 50 cents is not at all required, nor even usual among the different Greek enharmonic tunings, which tended instead to have the movable, inner notes (here, &amp; ; &amp; ) variably spaced, with about 20~30 cents between each other, and likewise spaced from their closest fixed note (for this example those are , , , and ).

==Bracketing tetrachords==
Four of the scale notes – the tonic ( in the example), subdominant (), dominant ( ), and octave () – are all fixed: They are nearly exactly the same relative pitches in all three categories of ancient Greek scales (enharmonic, &quot;chromatic&quot;, and &quot;diatonic&quot;), and in ancient Greek music, the fixed tones relative pitches were very nearly the same as the corresponding notes in the modern conventional scale. On the other hand, the four notes contained between the brackets, from the example and (between and ); and and (between and ) are the two pairs of bracketed, variable notes; they can have nearly any pitch. After pitches chosen for them, if the interval between a movable note and any other note is about a quarter tone or less, the scale is called &quot;enharmonic&quot;. The small, or &quot;microtonal&quot; interval can be between either of the bracketing fixed notes, or from the other movable note, inside the bracket.

Despite the music of India and the Middle East still using similar intervals in traditional and classical scales, even the idea of the very small pitch intervals used in the enharmonic scale has lain outside the competence of musicians trained in occidental music at least since the time of the early Roman Empire.

== Difference in meaning of &quot;enharmonic&quot; between the classical-era and now ==
The ancient Greek meaning of enharmonic is that the scale contains at least one very narrow interval. (The spacing of each pair notes between their bracketing fixed notes is usually either approximately or exactly the same, so when there is one narrow interval in one bracket there is almost always another one inside the other bracket.) 
Modern musical vocabulary has re-used the word &quot;enharmonic&quot; altered to have the most extreme possible meaning of its ancient sense, to mean two differently-named notes which happen to actually have the same pitch. In ancient Greek music from which &quot;enharmonic scales&quot; come, the meaning of &quot;enharmonic&quot; not so extreme: It means that the notes are &quot;not&quot; actually the same, but do only differ in pitch by a very slight amount, and had a similar connotation to &quot;microtonal&quot; in modern musical vocabulary.

Since an enharmonic scale uses (approximately) quarter tones, or more technically dieses (divisions) which do not occur on standard modern keyboards,
nor were even used in the preceding western tuning systems, such as ¼ comma temperament (the predominant tuning about 200 years ago) or well temperament (finally went out of use as conventional tuning about 140~150 years ago) the pitches and intervals in the several ancient Greek enharmonic scales are foreign to nearly any modern-trained musician, and generally outside the scope of musical competence of modern occidental musicians: People playing modern fixed-pitch instruments have no opportunity to experiment with musical scales containing these notes, since piano keyboards only have provisions for half tones, as do frets on guitars and mandolins, fingering holes on woodwinds, and valves on brass instruments. This has been the situation for more than 150 years for fixed-pitch occidental instruments.

Even among Hellenic musicians, enharmonic scales appear to have gone out of style around ago, and only persisted as a perfunctory part of normal musical training; enharmonic scales seem to have been oddities even to the Greek writers in the Roman Empire, whose works on music theory we still have. So the idea of such very small pitch intervals used in the enharmonic scale has lain outside of the scope of musicians&#x27; training for occidental music, despite music of India and the Middle East still using similar intervals traditional and classical scales.

== Unfamiliar, variable-size quarter tones ==
An otherwise well regarded 19th century musicologist once wrote the rather blatantly false definition in his 1905 musical dictionary, that the enharmonic scale is

: ... &quot;an [imaginary] gradual progression by quarter tones&quot; or any &quot;[musical] scale proceeding by quarter tones&quot;. — Elson (1905)

However, enharmonic tuning does seem &quot;imaginary&quot; to many modern western musicians because of the intentional limitations placed into conventional tuning, and deficient musical training which only prepares modern students to deal with a single tuning system, even though many others were in use in the west in the recent past, and still more are in current use in other parts of the world. Even well-educated musicologists have little or no understanding of ancient Greek musical scales (among whom sits Elson) nor even relatively recently disused tuning systems, such as the ¼ comma meantone temperament predominantly used up to the time of Bach, and the later unequal well temperaments based on it.

The enharmonic scale was a very real tuning system that survived from pre-classical Greek music (when it seems to have been put to more use) into the Roman Imperial era. Although still taught as a perfunctory part of Hellenistic education, the enharmonic scale was only rarely – if ever – used during the period of 180~400 CE when the Greek musical theory books which still survive were written.

The enharmonic scale uses dieses (divisions) which are not tuned in any pitch present on standard modern keyboards,
since modern, standard keyboards only have provisions for half-tone steps. The two different notations used for vocal and instrumental notes in ancient Greek music notation are more tonally versatile, since they are based on quarter-tones = half-sharps, with step sizes that could be altered from a strict quarter tone step. Despite the pitches being unknown to naïve occidentally-trained musicians, all the ancient Greek tuning systems only require seven distinct pitches in a completed octave, and only the four of those pitches, the two that lie between the fixed tonic and subdominant (or fourth) (relative to C, the notes between and ), and the other two movable notes between fixed dominant / fifth and the octave (between and ). When expressing notes with modern letter notation, it is conventional to use some elaborately sharpened or flattened version of the notes , , , and , representing not their precise pitches, but merely to follow the modern standard of giving every distinct pitch in a scale its own, separate letter.

Since the ancient Greek pitch systems only require eight different notes in a completed octave, and a modern keyboard has twelve, there actually are more than enough keys on any keyboard to implement one of the several enharmonic scales, contrary to Elson&#x27;s remark calling them &quot;imaginary&quot;. The only difficulty is retuning the strings (on an acoustic piano or harpsichord) or convincing an electronic sound module (for a modern electronic keyboard) to produce the bizarre pitches required for enharmonic scale , , , and notes; the fixed notes (, , , and ) may also need comparatively slight adjustments, but in enharmonic scales they are all very nearly (or even exactly) tuned to the same relative pitches they have in the conventional modern scale.

For example, in modern microtonal notation, and standard-pitch quarter tones (approximately 50¢ up = , down = ), a simplified version of one of the enharmonic scales is
: (0¢), (50¢), (100¢), (500¢),
: (700¢), (750¢), (800 ¢), (1200¢).

None of the pitches used in any standard enharmonic scale would actually be rounded to the nearest 50¢, but the approximate positions would be within about ±20¢ of those shown. It is also not necessary for the movable pitches to all lean toward their lower-bound fixed note; a somewhat more realistic example would be
: (0¢), (380¢), (420¢), (500¢),
: (700¢), (970¢), (1130 ¢), (1200¢).

The symbol in this instance represents a half-sharp, or sharpening by a quartertone, however the actual pitches for ancient Greek music the half sharp () and double sharp () pitches were allowed to be anything between around = 30~70cents, and = 130~240cents, depending on the aesthetics of the musician tuning the instrument.

Note that the modern sharp (), flat (), half-sharp (), and half-flat () symbols do &quot;not&quot; (usually) represent fixed pitch changes when used to annotate ancient Greek notes, but instead only the approximate location of the actual pitches used in the Greek scale.

Although the movable notes are highly variable when a scale is devised, after the choice is made, all the notes are stuck in their respective positions until the end of a musical piece. So their use is not like modern musical forms, like the blues, that use pitch bend on notes played on pitch elsewhere, and for those modern styles that use sliding pitch, at least in principle, any note might be bent during performance. As far as now known, the only form of &quot;pitch bend&quot; used by the ancient Greeks was in the initial tuning, with a bent pitch remaining bent until the instrument was retuned for the next piece of music.

More broadly, an enharmonic scale is a scale in which (using standard notation) there is no exact equivalence between a sharpened note and the flattened note it is enharmonically related to, such as in the quarter tone scale. As an example, F and G are equivalent in a chromatic scale (the same sound is spelled differently), but they are different sounds in an enharmonic scale (as well as nearly every known musical tuning &quot;except&quot; for the modern 12-tone E.T. scale). (&quot;See&quot;: musical tuning for a more complete introduction to the many non-12-tone E.T. tuning systems.)

Musical keyboards which distinguish between enharmonic notes are called by some modern scholars enharmonic keyboards, and more generically microtonal keyboards. (The enharmonic genus, a tetrachord with roots in early Greek music, is only loosely related to enharmonic scales.)

== Example of a modern, multi-tone enharmonic scale ==
As opposed to ancient Greek enharmonic scales, which only employed seven notes in an octave, modern musicians have expanded the idea of an &quot;enharmonic scale&quot; to include most of the pitches which ancient Greek tuning might select from to create a seven pitch octave. This gives the modern musician options for in-effect modulating between multiple different ancient Greek scales. This creates musical options that, as far as we now understand, was never possible for ancient Greeks musicians. Although note that some kitharodes were musically experimental and inventive, and sought musical novelty, so they might well have imagined alternating between different enharmonic scales. They might even accomplished it, by one musician switching between several different kitharas during a performance, with each tuned to a different, but tonally interlocking enharmonic scale.

Consider a scale constructed through Pythagorean tuning: A Pythagorean scale can be constructed &quot;upwards&quot; by wrapping a chain of perfect fifths around an octave, but it can also be constructed &quot;downwards&quot; by wrapping a chain of perfect fourths around the same octave. By juxtaposing these two slightly different scales, it is possible to create an enharmonic scale.

The following Pythagorean scale is enharmonic:

In the above scale the following pairs of notes are said to be enharmonic:
* C and D
* D and E
* F and G
* G and A
* A and B

In this example, natural notes are sharpened by multiplying its frequency ratio by (called a limma), and a natural note is flattened by multiplying its ratio by  . A pair of enharmonic notes are separated by a Pythagorean comma, which is equal to (about 23.46 cents).

<text>The Chief of Defence, formerly the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces (; acronym: ÖB) is the highest ranked professional military officer in the Swedish Armed Forces, and is by NATO terminology the Swedish chief of defence equivalent. The Chief of Defence is the agency head of the Swedish Armed Forces and formally reports to the Government of Sweden, though normally through the Minister for Defence. The primary responsibilities and duties of the Chief of Defence (and the charter for the Armed Forces) are prescribed in an ordinance issued by the Government.

The Chief of Defence is, apart from the honorary ranks held by the King of Sweden and in the past other members of the Swedish royal family, by unwritten convention normally the only professional military officer on active duty to hold the highest rank (a four-star General or Admiral). An exception was made 2009-2014 when Håkan Syrén was chairman of the European Union Military Committee.

The present Chief of Defence, General Michael Claesson, took office on 1 October 2024.

==History==
Before the modern era, the King was expected to command the forces himself; not seldom on location during war campaigns as shown by Gustavus Adolphus, Charles X, Charles XI, Charles XII and Gustav III. This remained the case formally until the 20th century. From the late 19th century onwards, there were no service chiefs of the Army or Navy; all senior service commanders reported directly to the King in Council. Apart from a single Minister for Defence created in 1919 by merging the position of ministers of the land forces and naval forces, no joint command structure existed.

In 1936, a Supreme Commander was intended to be appointed in war-time-only, and on 1 December 1939, during World War II, the first Supreme Commander, General Olof Thörnell, was appointed. In 1942 it was decided to keep this office even after the end of the war. The Supreme Commander would in wartime formally report to the King in Council until the enactment of the new Instrument of Government in 1974, and after 1 January 1975 to the Government.

==Heraldry==
The coat of arms of the Chief of Defence was used from 1991 to 1993. It has since 1993 been used by the Swedish Armed Forces and was used from 1994 to 2001 by the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters. Blazon: &quot;Azure, lesser coat of arms of Sweden, three open crowns or placed two and one. The shield surmounting an erect sword of the last colour&quot;.

The command flag of the Chief of Defence is drawn by Brita Grep and embroidered by hand by the Kedja studio, Heraldica. Blazon: &quot;Fessed in blue and yellow; on blue three open yellow crowns placed two and one, on yellow two blue batons of command with sets of open yellow crowns placed two and one in saltire.&quot;

=== Timeline ===
Every time a new Chief of Defence is to be appointed, there is some debate between the different services. Some feel that some kind of rotational system would be appropriate. In actuality, most Chiefs of Defence have come from the Army, and only one, Håkan Syrén, from the Navy. Because he is a general of the Amphibious Corps, there has to this day not been a single admiral to hold the office.

==List of Deputy Supreme Commanders==
Until 30 June 1994, the Chief of the Defence Staff was the second most senior member of the Swedish Armed Forces. When the Swedish Armed Forces was reorganized on 1 July 1994, the Chief of the Defence Staff position was abolished. Lieutenant General Percurt Green became the first Deputy Chief of Defence who took office on 1 July 1994. He also held the post of head of the Joint Operations Command (&quot;Operationsledningen&quot;, OpL).

In conjunction with the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters reorganization in 1998, a special position was created as Deputy Chief of Defence to relieve the Chief of Defence. The Deputy Chief of Defence led the Headquarters work through coordination of the operations. He also exercised employer responsibility for the staff in the Headquarters. In order to coordinate the operations he had a Coordination Department. The Deputy Chief of Defence also acted as the Deputy Agency Executive (&quot;Ställföreträdande myndighetschef&quot;). A formal position of head of the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters was established in 2002.

From 1 October 2005, the post of Deputy Chief of Defence became the Director General of the Swedish Armed Forces held by a civil servant.

<doc id="851725" wikidata="Q1772024" url="?curid=851725" title="Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston">
<text>The two fights between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Sonny Liston]] for [[boxing]]&#x27;s [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|World Heavyweight Championship]] were among the most controversial fights in the sport&#x27;s history. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine named their first meeting, the Liston–Clay fight (Ali had not yet changed his name from Cassius Clay), as the fourth greatest sports moment of the twentieth century.

The first bout was held on February25, 1964 in Miami Beach, Florida. Clay, who was an 8:1 underdog, won in a major upset, when the champion gave up at the opening of the seventh round. Their second fight was on May25, 1965 in Lewiston, Maine, which Ali won with a first-round knockout. The infamous &quot;phantom punch&quot;, as well as a botched count by the referee, aroused suspicions of a fix and have been subject to debate ever since.

==Liston vs. Clay I==
===Background===
Liston was the World Heavyweight Champion at the time of the first Liston–Clay fight in Miami Beach on February 25, 1964, having demolished former champion Floyd Patterson by a first-round knockout in September 1962. Ten months later, Liston and Patterson met again with the same result – Patterson was knocked out in the first round. 

At the time of the fight, Liston was generally considered the most intimidating fighter in the world, and among the best heavyweight boxers of all time. With the Patterson victory, Liston had defeated eight of the top 10 ranked contenders at heavyweight; seven of those victories were by knockout. Many were reluctant to meet him in the ring. Henry Cooper, the British champion, said he would be interested in a title fight if Clay won, but he was not going to get in the ring with Liston. Cooper&#x27;s manager, Jim Wicks, said, &quot;We don&#x27;t even want to meet Liston walking down the same street.&quot;

Boxing promoter Harold Conrad said, &quot;People talked about [Mike] Tyson before he got beat, but Liston was more ferocious, more indestructible. ... When Sonny gave you the evil eye—I don&#x27;t care who you were—you shrunk to two feet tall.&quot; Tex Maule wrote in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;: &quot;Liston&#x27;s arms are massively muscled, the left jab is more than a jab. It hits with true shock power. It never occurred to Liston that he might lose a fight.&quot; Johnny Tocco, a trainer who worked with George Foreman and Mike Tyson as well as Liston, said Liston was the hardest hitter of the three. Several boxing writers actually thought Liston could be damaging to the sport because he could not be beaten. Liston&#x27;s ominous, glowering demeanor was so central to his image that &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine caused a controversy by posing him in a Santa Claus hat for its December 1963 cover.

Liston learned to box in the Missouri State Penitentiary while serving time for armed robbery. Later, he was re-incarcerated for assaulting a police officer. For much of his career, his contract was majority owned by Frankie Carbo, a one-time mob hitman and senior member of the Lucchese crime family, who ran boxing interests for the Mafia. The mob was deeply entrenched in boxing at every level at the time, and Liston was never able to escape being labeled as the personification of everything that was unseemly and criminal in the sport, despite the fact that his criminality had been in the past. He distrusted boxing writers, and they paid him back, often depicting him as little more than an ignorant thug and a bully. He was typically described in thinly veiled racist terms—a &quot;gorilla&quot; and &quot;hands like big bananas&quot;. Author James Baldwin understood Liston perhaps better than anyone in the press and sympathized with him and liked him, unlike boxing writers. He said &quot;Liston was the big Negro in every white man&#x27;s hallway.&quot; He was a man who, according to Ali biographer David Remnick, &quot;had never gotten a break and was never going to give one&quot;.

On the other hand, Clay was a glib, fast-talking 22-year-old challenger who enjoyed the spotlight. Known as &quot;The Louisville Lip&quot;, he had won the light heavyweight gold medal at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Italy. He had great hand and foot speed and lightning fast reflexes, not to mention a limitless supply of braggadocio. However, Clay had been knocked down by journeyman Sonny Banks early in his career, and, in his previous two fights, had eked out a controversial decision against Doug Jones and—more seriously—was knocked down by a left hook at the end of round four against the cut-prone converted southpaw Henry Cooper. Clay was clearly &quot;out on his feet&quot; in his corner between rounds, and his trainer, Angelo Dundee, stalled for time to allow Clay to recover. Although Clay rallied to win the fight in the next round, it seemed clear to many that he would be no match against the daunting Liston, who seemed a more complete boxer in every way than Cooper.

The brash Clay was equally disliked by reporters and his chances were widely dismissed. Lester Bromberg&#x27;s forecast in the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; was typical, predicting, &quot;It will last longer than the Patterson fight—almost the entire first round.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Jim Murray observed, &quot;The only thing at which Clay can beat Liston is reading the dictionary,&quot; adding that the face-off between the two unlikeable athletes would be &quot;the most popular fight since Hitler and Stalin—180 million Americans rooting for a double knockout.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ regular boxing writer Joe Nichols declined to cover the fight, assuming that it would be a mismatch. By fight time, Clay was an 8-to-1 betting underdog. Of the 46 sportswriters at ringside, 43 had picked Liston to win by knockout.

Liston, however, brought weaknesses into the Clay fight that were not fully apparent at the time. He claimed to be 32 years old at the time of the bout, but many believed that his true age was closer to 34, perhaps even older. Liston had been suffering from bursitis in his shoulders for close to a year and had been receiving cortisone shots. In training for the Clay fight, he re-injured his left shoulder and was supposedly in pain striking the heavy bag. He secretly resorted to heavy icing and ultrasound therapy after each training session. And, ironically, because of his dominance, Liston had actually logged little ring time in the past three years. Between March 1961 and the Clay fight, Liston had fought three times and won each bout with first-round knockouts—meaning that he had fought a total of just over six minutes during a 35-month stretch.

One of the reasons that Clay&#x27;s chances were dismissed is that his boxing style seemed ill-suited to the heavyweight division. He was widely viewed as a fast but light puncher lacking the ability to take a punch or to fight inside. The signatures of Clay&#x27;s style and later greatness—the tendency to keep his hands low and lean away from punches (often leaving his opponent hitting air, off balance, and exposed to counter punches), his constant movement and reluctance to set (making him extremely difficult to hit)—were viewed as fundamental technical flaws that would be quickly exploited by an experienced, hard-hitting heavyweight like Liston. &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; columnist Jimmy Cannon summarized this view when he wrote: &quot;Clay doesn&#x27;t fight like the valid heavyweight he is. He seldom sets and misses a lot. In a way, Clay is a freak. He is a bantamweight who weighs more than 200 pounds [91kg].&quot;

Liston trained minimally for the bout, convinced that he would dispose of Clay within the first two rounds. He typically ran just one mile a day instead of his usual five, reportedly ate hot dogs and drank beer, and was rumored to have been furnished with prostitutes in training camp.

===Pre-fight publicity===
The television series &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; did multiple segments about the title fight. Panelists Bill Cullen, Henry Morgan and Betsy Palmer predicted that Liston would win in the third, second, and first rounds, respectively. Host Garry Moore was even more pessimistic about Clay&#x27;s chances, estimating a Liston knockout &quot;in the very early moments of round one&quot;, adding, &quot;if I were Cassius, I would catch a cab and leave town.&quot; Actor Hal March went a step further, albeit humorously: &quot;I think the fight will end in the dressing room. I think [Clay] is going to faint before he comes out.&quot;

The night before the first fight, on February24, 1964, the show featured Clay and Liston&#x27;s sparring partners as guests. Harvey Jones brought with him a lengthy rhyming boast from Cassius Clay:

Clay also presented that poem on &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; with Liberace giving improvised piano harmony.

Jesse Bowdry brought a much terser written message from Sonny Liston:

The following week, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; brought on two sportswriters whose secret was that they had been the only writers to correctly predict Clay&#x27;s victory.

===Baiting the bear===
Clay began taunting and provoking Liston almost immediately after the two agreed to fight. He purchased a bus and had it emblazoned with the words &quot;Liston Must Go In Eight&quot;. On the day of the contract signing, he drove it to Liston&#x27;s home in Denver, waking the champion (with the press in tow) at 3:00 a.m. shouting, &quot;Come on out of there. I&#x27;m gonna whip you now.&quot; Liston had just moved into a white neighborhood and was furious at the attention this caused. Clay took to driving his entourage in the bus to the site in Surfside, Florida where Liston (nicknamed the &quot;Big Bear&quot;) was training, and repeatedly called Liston the &quot;big, ugly bear&quot;. Liston grew increasingly irritated as the motor-mouthed Clay continued hurling insults: &quot;After the fight, I&#x27;m gonna build myself a pretty home and use him as a bearskin rug. Liston even smells like a bear. I&#x27;m gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him ... if Sonny Liston whups me, I&#x27;ll kiss his feet in the ring, crawl out of the ring on my knees, tell him he&#x27;s the greatest, and catch the next jet out of the country.&quot; Clay insisted to a skeptical press that he would knock out Liston in eight rounds (former light heavyweight champion José Torres, in his 1971 biography of Ali, &quot;Sting Like a Bee&quot;, said that as of 1963, Ali&#x27;s prophetic poems had correctly predicted the exact round he would stop an opponent 12 times).

Clay&#x27;s brashness did not endear him to white Americans, and, in fact, even made Liston a more sympathetic character. In &quot;The New Republic&quot;, the editor Murray Kempton wrote, &quot;Liston used to be a hoodlum; now he is our cop; he was the big Negro we pay to keep sassy Negroes in line.&quot;

It has been widely stated that Clay&#x27;s antics were a deliberate form of psychological warfare designed to unsettle Liston by stoking his anger, encouraging his overconfidence and even fueling uncertainty about Clay&#x27;s sanity. As Clay himself said, &quot;If Liston wasn&#x27;t thinking nothing but killing me, he wasn&#x27;t thinking fighting. You got to think to fight.&quot; Former World Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis said, &quot;Liston is an angry man, and he can&#x27;t afford to be angry fighting Clay.&quot; Clay&#x27;s outbursts also fed Liston&#x27;s belief that Clay was terrified (something Clay&#x27;s camp did little to disavow). Clay said later, &quot;I knew that Liston, overconfident that he was, was never going to train to fight more than two rounds. He couldn&#x27;t see nothing to me at all but mouth.&quot; In contrast, Clay prepared hard for the fight, studying films of Liston&#x27;s prior bouts and even detecting that Liston telegraphed his punches with eye movement.

===The Nation of Islam===
Several weeks before the fight, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; published an article quoting Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the Black Muslims when he was 18. &quot;They have been hammering at him ever since,&quot; Clay Sr. said. &quot;He&#x27;s so confused now that he doesn&#x27;t even know where he&#x27;s at.&quot; He said his youngest son, Rudy Clay, had also joined. &quot;They ruined my two boys,&quot; Clay Sr. said. &quot;Muslims tell my boys to hate white people; to hate women; to hate their mother.&quot; Clay Jr. responded by saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what my father said. ... I&#x27;m here training for a fight, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m going to say.&quot;
As the story began to spread, promoters became increasingly uneasy. Bill MacDonald, the main promoter, threatened to cancel the fight unless Clay publicly disavowed the Nation of Islam (NOI). Clay refused. A compromise was reached when Malcolm X, at the time a companion of Clay&#x27;s as well as a feared and incendiary spokesperson for the Nation of Islam (though Malcolm X had, by that time, been censured by the NOI—banned from speaking to the press and suspended from all official NOI roles and duties—and would soon officially break with the Nation), agreed to keep a low profile, save for the night of the fight when he would rejoin Clay&#x27;s entourage as spiritual advisor and view the fight from a ringside seat. While Clay would not definitively link himself with the Nation of Islam and its leader, Elijah Muhammad, until the day after the fight—at the annual NOI Savior&#x27;s Day celebration—his association with the Nation, seen by many as a hate group due in part to its strict anti-integrationist stance, further complicated his relations with the press and the white public, further deprived the fight of the &quot;good guy/bad guy&quot; narrative, and negatively affected the gate. MacDonald would ultimately lose $300,000 on the bout.

According to Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali had converted to Islam and joined the Nation of Islam several years prior to the fight, but had kept his religion and affiliation a secret up until the fight.

===The weigh-in===
Ali&#x27;s outbursts reached their peak at the pre-fight weigh-in/physical the morning of the event. Championship bout weigh-ins, before this, had been predictable and boring. Ali entered the room where the weigh-in would be held wearing a denim jacket with the words &quot;Bear Huntin&#x27;&quot; on the back and carrying an African walking stick. He began waving the stick, screaming, &quot;I&#x27;m the champ! Tell Sonny I&#x27;m here. Bring that big ugly bear on.&quot; When Liston appeared, Ali went wild. &quot;Someone is going to die at ringside tonight!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You&#x27;re scared, chump!&quot; He was restrained by members of his entourage. Writer Mort Sharnik thought Ali was having a seizure. Robert Lipsyte, the &quot;New York Times&quot; writer, likened the scene to a &quot;police action, with an enormous amount of movement and noise exploding in a densely packed room.&quot; Amidst the pandemonium, he was fined $2,500 by the commission for his behavior. Ali worked himself into such a frenzy that his heart rate registered 120 beats per minute, more than twice its normal rate, and his blood pressure was 200/100. Dr. Alexander Robbins, the chief physician of the Miami Boxing Commission, determined that he was &quot;emotionally unbalanced, scared to death, and liable to crack up before he enters the ring.&quot; He said if Ali&#x27;s blood pressure didn&#x27;t return to normal, the fight would be canceled. Many others also took Clay&#x27;s antics to mean that he was terrified. In fact, a local radio station later reported a rumor that he had been spotted at the airport buying a ticket to leave the country. A second examination conducted an hour later revealed Ali&#x27;s blood pressure and pulse had returned to normal. It had all been an act. Ali later said, &quot;Liston&#x27;s not afraid of me, but he&#x27;s afraid of a nut.&quot;

===The fight===

Clay weighed in at while Liston was several pounds over his prime fighting weight at . Many of those watching were surprised during the referee&#x27;s instructions to see that Clay was considerably taller than Liston. While receiving instructions, Liston glowered at Clay, while Clay stared back and stood on his toes to appear even taller. Clay later said of the moment: &quot;I won&#x27;t lie, I was scared ... It frightened me, just knowing how hard he hit. But I didn&#x27;t have no choice but to go out and fight.&quot;

At the opening bell, an angry Liston charged Clay, looking to end the fight quickly and decisively. However, Clay&#x27;s superior speed and movement were immediately evident, as he slipped most of Liston&#x27;s lunging punches, making the champion look awkward. Clay clearly gained confidence as the round progressed. He hit Liston with a combination that electrified the crowd with about 30 seconds left in the round and began scoring repeatedly with his left jab (the round lasted an extra 8.5 seconds because referee Barney Felix didn&#x27;t hear the bell). Clay had been hit hard by a right to the stomach, but he said later, &quot;I felt good because I knew I could survive.&quot; Milt Bailey, one of Liston&#x27;s cornermen, recalled, &quot;In the first round Sonny couldn&#x27;t catch up with Clay, and I thought we might have some trouble.&quot; Indeed, it was perhaps the worst round of Liston&#x27;s career. Between rounds, sitting on his stool, Clay turned to the press contingent at ringside and opened his mouth as if yawning or making a mute roar.

Liston settled down somewhat in round two. At one point, he cornered Clay against the ropes and hit him with a hard left hook. Clay later confessed that he was hurt by the punch, but Liston failed to press his advantage. Two of the official scorers awarded the round to Liston and the other had it even.

In the third round, Clay began to take control of the fight. At about 30 seconds into the round, he hit Liston with several combinations, causing a bruise under Liston&#x27;s right eye and a cut under his left, which eventually required eight stitches to close. It was the first time in his career that Liston had been cut. At one point in this attack, Liston was rocked as he was driven to the ropes. Les Keiter, broadcasting at ringside, shouted, &quot;This could be the upset of the century!&quot; Mort Sharnik described the moment: &quot;Cassius hit Liston with a one-two combination; a jab followed by a straight right. Cassius pulled the jab back and there was a mouse underneath Sonny&#x27;s right eye. Then he pulled the right back and there was a gash underneath the other eye. ... It was like the armor plate of a battleship being pierced. I said to myself, &#x27;My God, Cassius Clay is winning this fight! A clearly angered Liston rallied at the end of the round, as Clay seemed tired, and delivered punishing shots to Clay&#x27;s body. It was probably Liston&#x27;s best moment in the entire fight. But as the round ended, Clay shouted to him, &quot;you big sucka, I got you now&quot;. Sitting on his stool between rounds, Liston was breathing heavily as his cornermen worked on his cut.

During the fourth round, Clay coasted, keeping his distance and Liston appeared dominant. Joe Louis commenting on TV at ringside said &quot;It&#x27;s looking good for Sonny Liston&quot;. However, when Clay returned to his corner, he started complaining that there was something burning in his eyes and he could not see. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what the heck was going on,&quot; Angelo Dundee, Clay&#x27;s trainer, recalled on an NBC special 25 years later. &quot;He said, &#x27;cut the gloves off. I want to prove to the world there&#x27;s dirty work afoot.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;whoa, whoa, back up baby. C&#x27;mon now, this is for the title, this is the big apple. What are you doing? Sit down!&#x27; So I get him down, I get the sponge and I pour the water into his eyes trying to cleanse whatever&#x27;s there, but before I did that I put my pinkie in his eye and I put it into my eye. It burned like hell. There was something caustic in both eyes.&quot;

The commotion was not lost on referee Barney Felix, who was walking toward Clay&#x27;s corner. Felix said Clay was seconds from being disqualified. The challenger, his arms held high in surrender, was demanding that the fight be stopped and Dundee, fearing the fight might indeed be halted, gave his charge a one-word order: &quot;Run!&quot;

Clay later said he could only see a faint shadow of Liston during most of the round, but by circling and moving he managed to avoid Liston and somehow survive. By the sixth round, Clay&#x27;s sight had cleared, and he began landing combinations almost at will. &quot;I got back to my stool at the end of the sixth round, and under me I could hear the press like they had gone wild,&quot; Clay later said. &quot;I twisted round and hollered down at the reporters, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna upset the world. 

There are two basic narratives about what occurred next in Liston&#x27;s corner. According to Ali biographer David Remnick, Liston told his cornermen, &quot;That&#x27;s it.&quot; This supposedly rallied Liston&#x27;s handlers, who thought he meant he was finally angry enough to win, but Liston really meant that he was through fighting, which he indicated by spitting out his mouth guard.

However, Liston biographer Paul Gallender&#x27;s take is that Liston&#x27;s shoulder was essentially paralyzed by the end of round six, and his corner made the decision to end the fight, despite Liston&#x27;s protests. Liston spit out his mouth guard in disgust, still not believing that Clay was the superior fighter.

As the bell sounded for the seventh round, Clay was the first to notice that Liston had spat out his mouth guard. Clay moved to the middle of the ring with his arms raised, dancing the jig that would become known as the &quot;Ali Shuffle&quot; while Howard Cosell, broadcasting at ringside, shouted &quot;wait a minute! Wait a minute! Sonny Liston is not coming out!&quot; Liston failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by technical knockout. Liston became the first World Champion since Jess Willard in 1919 to retire on his stool during a Heavyweight title fight. At that point the bout was level on the official scorecards of the referee and two judges.

Sensing that he had made history, Clay quickly ran to the ropes amidst the commotion in the ring and shouted at sportswriters, &quot;Eat your words!&quot; In a scene that has been rebroadcast countless times over the ensuing decades, Clay repeatedly yelled &quot;I&#x27;m the greatest!&quot; and &quot;I shook up the world.&quot;

Clay had to be persuaded to hold the traditional post-fight press conference. He called the writers &quot;hypocrites&quot; and said, &quot;Look at me. Not a mark on me. I could never be an underdog. I am too great. Hail the champion!&quot;

On February27, 1964, Clay announced that he was a member of the Nation of Islam. His membership in the group was first disclosed the previous night at the group&#x27;s annual national convention in Chicago by Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.

&quot;I began worshiping this way five years ago when I heard a fellow named Elijah Muhammad on the radio talking about the virtues of the Islam religion,&quot; Clay said. &quot;I also listened to his ministers. No one could prove him or them wrong, so I decided to join.&quot;

Clay started going by the name Cassius X, as members of the organization adopt the last name X because they no longer want to bear names handed down by former slave-owning families.

On March1, 1964, Ed Sullivan said on his show: &quot;I saw the Liston-Clay fight. This was a stinker of all-time. I swear The Beatles could beat the two of &#x27;em! No kidding!&quot; The Beatles had been on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; twice in February. During their second appearance, which aired February16 from Miami, Sullivan actually had Liston and Joe who were in the stand up for applause; the group also visited Clay&#x27;s training center later in the week.

On March6, 1964, Elijah Muhammad announced in a recorded statement played over the radio that Clay would be renamed Muhammad Ali. Muhammad means &quot;worthy of all praises&quot;, and Ali means &quot;most high&quot;.

===Did Liston&#x27;s corner deliberately blind Clay?===
Many theorized that a substance used on Liston&#x27;s cuts by Joe Pollino, his cutman, may have inadvertently caused the irritation that blinded Clay in round four. &quot;Joe Pollino had used Monsel&#x27;s Solution on that cut,&quot; Angelo Dundee said. &quot;Now what had happened was that probably the kid put his forehead leaning in on the guy—because Liston was starting to wear in with those body shots—and my kid, sweating profusely, it went into both eyes.&quot;

Two days after the fight, heavyweight contender Eddie Machen said he believed that Liston&#x27;s handlers made deliberate use of illegal medication to temporarily blind Clay. &quot;The same thing happened to me when I fought Liston in 1960,&quot; Machen said. &quot;I thought my eyes would burn out of my head, and Liston seemed to know it would happen.&quot; He theorized that Liston&#x27;s handlers would rub medication on his shoulders, which would then be transferred to his opponent&#x27;s forehead during clinches and drip into the eyes. &quot;Clay did the worst thing when he started screaming and let Liston know it had worked,&quot; Machen said. &quot;Clay panicked. I didn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m more of a seasoned pro, and I hid it from Liston.&quot;

It is noteworthy that Machen did not mention the eye burning problem immediately after his fight with Liston, citing an injury to his arm as contributing to his defeat.

===Shoulder injury===
Liston said he quit the fight because of a shoulder injury, and there has been speculation since about whether the injury was severe enough to actually prevent him from continuing. Immediately after the fight, Liston told broadcasters that he hurt the shoulder in the first round. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder.

For his book, &quot;King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero&quot;, David Remnick spoke with one of Liston&#x27;s cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: &quot;[The shoulder] was all BS. We had no return bout clause with Clay, and if you say your guy just quit, who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot.&quot;

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Tex Maule wrote that Liston&#x27;s shoulder injury was legitimate. He cited Liston&#x27;s inability to lift his arm: &quot;There is no doubt that Liston&#x27;s arm was damaged. In the sixth round, he carried it at belt level so that it was of no help in warding off the right crosses with which Clay probed at the cut under his left eye.&quot; He also cited medical evidence: &quot;A team of eight doctors inspected Liston&#x27;s arm at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach and agreed that it was too badly damaged for Liston to continue fighting. The torn tendon had bled down into the mass of the biceps, swelling and numbing the arm.&quot;

Those findings were confirmed in a formal investigation immediately after the fight by Florida State Attorney Richard Gerstein, who also noted that there was little doubt that Liston went into the fight with a sore or lame shoulder. Despite Liston carrying an injury and being undertrained, Ali stated in 1975 that this fight was his toughest ever.

===Allegations of a fix===
There were allegations of a fix as soon as the fight ended. Arthur Daley of the &quot;New York Times&quot; did not believe the claim. He wrote:
:When a fight ends in the fashion this one did, with the unbeatable monster remaining in his corner, suspicions of larceny are immediately aroused. They are not helped by the fact that Liston, an ex-convict, was sponsored by mobsters at the start of his career. For the larceny theory to be valid, however, there would have to be an overwhelming reason for it. The prospects of a betting coup can be dismissed because the 8-to-1 odds in Liston&#x27;s favor never varied more than a point. If there had been a rush of smart money on the underdog, the odds would have plummeted. This is an unfailing barometer of hanky-panky. What would Liston have gained by throwing the fight? The heavyweight championship is the most valuable commodity in the world of sports and not even a man of Liston&#x27;s criminal background would willingly toss it away. It also brought him an aura of respectability such as he never had known before.

After a month-long investigation, Florida State Attorney Richard E. Gerstein said there was no evidence to support the claim of a fix, and a United States Senate subcommittee conducted hearings three months later and also found no evidence of a fix.

Documents were released to the &quot;Washington Times&quot; in 2014 under the Freedom of Information Act which show the FBI suspected the fight may have been fixed by Ash Resnick, a Las Vegas figure tied to organized crime and to Liston. The documents show no evidence that Ali was in on the scheme or even knew about it, and nothing suggests the bureau ever corroborated the suspicions it investigated. The memos were addressed directly to Director J. Edgar Hoover.

A memo dated May24, 1966, which the &quot;Washington Times&quot; called &quot;the most tantalizing evidence,&quot; details an interview with a Houston gambler named Barnett Magids, who described to agents his discussions with Resnick before the first Clay-Liston fight. The &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported:
:&quot;On one occasion, Resnick introduced Magids to Sonny Liston at the Thunderbird, [one of the Las Vegas hotels organized crime controlled],&quot; the memo states. &quot;About a week before the Liston and Clay fight in Miami, Resnick called and invited Magids and his wife for two weeks in Florida on Resnick. Magids&#x27; wife was not interested in going, but Magids decided to go along, and Resnick was going to send him a ticket.

:&quot;Two or three days before the fight, Magids called Resnick at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami to say he could not come,&quot; the memo states. &quot;On this call, he asked Resnick who he liked in the fight, and Resnick said that Liston would knock Clay out in the second round. Resnick suggested he wait until just before the fight to place any bets because the odds may come down.

:&quot;At about noon on the day of the fight, [Magids] reached Resnick again by phone, and at this time, Resnick said for him to not make any bets, but just go watch the fight on pay TV and he would know why and that he could not talk further at that time.

:&quot;Magids did go see the fight on TV and immediately realized that Resnick knew that Liston was going to lose,&quot; the document states. &quot;A week later, there was an article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writing up Resnick as a big loser because of his backing of Liston. Later people &#x27;in the know&#x27; in Las Vegas told Magids that Resnick and Liston both reportedly made over $1 million betting against Liston on the fight and that the magazine article was a cover for this.&quot;

The article was controversial, with Ron Kantowski of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; writing that the &quot;Washington Times&quot; article &quot;had more holes than the left side of the Cubs&#x27; infield.&quot; He continued:
:Here, then, is the most titillating part of the &quot;Washington Times&quot; story: &quot;At about noon on the day of the fight, (Barnett Magids) reached Resnick again by phone, and at this time, Resnick said for him to not make any bets, but just go watch the fight on pay TV, and he would know why ...&quot;

:This was after the weigh-in, when Ali went berserk and Sonny just burped up a couple of ... hot dogs.

:Is it possible this is why Ash Resnick might have told Barnett Magids—according to Magids—not to make any bets on Liston?

:According to a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; story, Resnick lost a lot of money betting on Liston. ... The &quot;Washington Times&quot;″ story suggested ... the magazine story may have been a cover-up, quoting &quot;people in the know.&quot;

:Sometimes in boxing, a guy trains on hot dogs and beer, and then maybe he injures his shoulder. A guy everybody expects to win, doesn&#x27;t win. And then there are FBI files and conspiracy theories, and then &quot;people in the know&quot; want to put a guy like Sonny Liston on the grassy knoll with a smoking gun in his hand.

==Ali vs. Liston II==
===Background===
Following Clay&#x27;s upset victory over Liston, both fighters were almost immediately embroiled in controversy that was considered detrimental to the sport of boxing. A couple of days after the fight, Clay publicly announced that he had joined the &quot;Black Muslims&quot;—which at the time was widely viewed as a hate group against white people—and started going by the name Cassius X. The following month, he was renamed Muhammad Ali by Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. This evoked widespread public condemnation. Martin Luther King Jr. said, &quot;When Cassius Clay joined the Black Muslims and started calling himself Cassius X, he became a champion of racial segregation.&quot; As for Liston, he was arrested on March12 and charged with speeding, careless and reckless driving, driving without an operator&#x27;s license and carrying a concealed weapon. The arresting officer said the former champion was driving between in a residential zone. Liston had a loaded .22 caliber revolver in his coat pocket and there were empty bottles of vodka in the car. A young woman was in the car with Liston, but she was not arrested. In short, at a time when Congress was investigating corruption and organized crime influence in boxing, neither fighter was seen as a poster child for the sport.

In the view of some, the unexpected ending of the bout took on suspicious overtones when it was discovered that the two fighters had a contract which contained a rematch clause. Many argued that Liston had more to gain financially from losing the bout and fighting a rematch than he did from winning. The contract gave Inter-Continental Promotions, Inc., a firm organized to promote Liston&#x27;s fights, the right to promote Ali&#x27;s first fight as champion—if he should beat Liston—and pick his opponent (Liston, of course). This was in a second contract, kept secret and not part of the main fight contract. It was phrased as it was because the World Boxing Association did not allow fight contracts with rematch clauses. Gordon B. Davidson, an attorney for the group sponsoring Ali, said, &quot;We felt we would be better advised not to have a guaranteed rematch clause. We felt this was more in the spirit of the WBA rules than a direct rematch which was clearly outlawed.&quot; He agreed that it was &quot;subterfuge&quot;. When Ali and Liston signed to fight a rematch, the WBA voted unanimously to strip Ali of the title and drop Liston from its rankings. However, the World Boxing Council, the New York State Athletic Commission and &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine continued to recognize Ali as champion.

Pressed by the WBA—which included every U.S. state except California, Nevada and New York—state boxing commissions throughout the nation were reluctant to license a rematch between the two controversial fighters, and it was difficult to find a venue. Ultimately, Massachusetts agreed to host the bout, which resulted in the suspension of the Massachusetts Boxing Commission by the WBA. The fight was set for November16, 1964, at the Boston Garden. Liston was immediately established as a 13:5 favorite, making Ali a greater betting underdog than Floyd Patterson in his two fights against Liston. This time, Liston trained hard, preparing himself for a 15-round bout. In fact, &quot;Time&quot; magazine said that Liston had worked himself into the best shape of his career. Ali, for his part, continued to taunt Liston, dragging a bear trap to the pre-fight physical and announcing that he might begin manufacturing the &quot;Sonny Liston Sit-Down Stool&quot;. However, the Boston fight would never occur. Three days before the scheduled bout (on a Friday the 13th, as it happened), Ali needed emergency surgery for a strangulated hernia. The bout would need to be delayed by six months.

The new date was set for May25, 1965. But as it approached, Liston was involved in yet another arrest and there were fears that the promoters were tied to organized crime. Massachusetts officials, most notably Suffolk County District Attorney Garrett H. Byrne, began to have second thoughts. Byrne sought an injunction blocking the fight in Boston because Inter-Continental Promotions was promoting the fight without a Massachusetts license. Inter-Continental said local veteran Sam Silverman was the promoter. On May7, backers of the rematch ended the court battle by pulling the fight out of Boston.

===Lewiston, Maine===

The promoters needed a new location quickly, whatever the size, to rescue their closed circuit television commitment around the country. Governor John H. Reed of Maine stepped forward, and within a few hours, the promoters had a new site: Lewiston, Maine, a mill town with a population of about 41,000 located north of Boston. Inter-Continental obtained a permit and made an arrangement to work with local promoter Sam Michael. The venue selected was the Central Maine Youth Center (now called The Colisée), a junior hockey rink. Lewiston was the smallest city to host a heavyweight title bout since Jack Dempsey fought Tom Gibbons in Shelby, Montana (population 3,000) in 1923. It remains the only heavyweight title fight held in the state of Maine.

The fight was embraced by the Pine Tree State. Governor Reed announced to the press, &quot;This is one of the greatest things to happen in Maine.&quot; Nevertheless, it would go down in history as a debacle.

The atmosphere surrounding the fight was tense and sometimes ugly, largely due to the repercussions of Ali&#x27;s public embrace of Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X, who had a public and bitter falling out with Elijah Muhammad, had been assassinated several months before the fight, and the men arrested for the slaying were members of the Nation of Islam. Rumors circulated that Ali, who had publicly snubbed Malcolm after his break with Elijah Muhammad, might be killed by Malcolm&#x27;s supporters in retaliation. The FBI took the threats seriously enough to post a 12-man, 24-hour guard around Ali. Liston&#x27;s camp, in turn, claimed he had received a death threat from the Nation of Islam. The Fruit of Islam—the omnipresent, bow-tied paramilitary wing of the Nation of Islam—surrounding Ali only added to the sense of foreboding and hostility. Security for the fight was unprecedented.

===The phantom/anchor punch===
The ending of the second Ali-Liston fight remains one of the most controversial in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali supposedly went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. He rolled over, got to his right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into disarray. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had a hard time getting Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, &quot;Get up and fight, sucker!&quot; and &quot;Nobody will believe this!&quot; The moment was captured by ringside photographer Neil Leifer in what became one of the most iconic images in sport, chosen as the cover of the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; special issue, &quot;The Century&#x27;s Greatest Sports Photos&quot;. Ali then began prancing around the ring with his arms raised in victory.

When Walcott got back to Liston and looked at the knockdown timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. &quot;The timekeeper was waving both hands and saying, &#x27;I counted him out—the fight is over, Walcott said after the fight. &quot;Nat Fleischer [editor of &quot;The Ring&quot;] was seated beside McDonough and he was waving his hands, too, saying it was over.&quot; Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory.

It is one of the quickest heavyweight title knockouts in history. Many in the small crowd had not even settled in their seats when the fight was stopped. The official time of the stoppage was announced as 1:00 into the first round, which was wrong. Liston went down at 1:44, got up at 1:56, and Walcott stopped the fight at 2:12.

McDonough and Fleischer were also wrong in their interpretation of how the rules applied. Under the rules, the timekeeper is supposed to start the count at the time of a knockdown. The referee&#x27;s duty is to get the boxer scoring the knockdown to a neutral corner, pick up the count from the timekeeper and continue it aloud for the knocked down boxer. Under the rules of the Maine Commission, the referee was authorized to stop his count if a boxer refused to go to the proper corner. &quot;It might have been better if Walcott had stopped the count (by the knockdown timekeeper) until Clay went to the neutral corner and then started again,&quot; said Duncan MacDonald, a commission member.

&quot;I did my job,&quot; Walcott said. &quot;He [Ali] looked like a man in a different world. I didn&#x27;t know what he might do. I thought he might stomp him or pick him up and belt him again.&quot;

&quot;If that bum Clay had gone to a neutral corner instead of running around like a maniac, all the trouble would have been avoided,&quot; McDonough said. He acknowledged that Walcott could have asked him to start the count again &quot;after he got that wild man—Clay—back to a neutral corner, but he didn&#x27;t, so that was that.&quot;

===Alleged match fixing===
When the fight ended, numerous fans booed and started yelling, &quot;Fix!&quot; Skeptics called the knockout blow &quot;the phantom punch&quot;. Ali called it &quot;the anchor punch&quot;. He said it was taught to him by comedian and film actor Stepin Fetchit, who learned it from Jack Johnson. However, Ali was unsure immediately after the fight as to whether or not the punch connected, as footage from the event shows Ali in the ring asking his entourage, &quot;Did I hit him?&quot; Ali told Nation of Islam minister Abdul Rahman that Liston &quot;laid down&quot; and Rahman replied, &quot;No, you hit him.&quot; Rahman later said, &quot;Ali hit him so fast, Ali didn&#x27;t really know he hit him. ... and it took a long time before even he saw the punch he hit Sonny with.&quot; Ali never used the &quot;anchor punch&quot; in subsequent fights, nor did he mention it in later discussions about his career. This has led to ongoing debates about the nature and impact of the punch, as well as the legitimacy of Liston&#x27;s fall.

After the fight, George Chuvalo climbed through the ropes and shoved Ali, yelling, &quot;Fix!&quot; He was restrained, but later he said that he had seen Liston&#x27;s eyes while the challenger was on the floor, and he knew that he was not in bad shape. &quot;His eyes were darting from side to side like this,&quot; he said, darting his eyes from side to side. &quot;When a fighter is hurt his eyes roll up.&quot; 

There were some at ringside who believed the fight was legitimate. Larry Merchant, who was a critic of Liston as a person throughout his career, wrote 50 years later, &quot;I saw the actual punch land on the actual chin, as did others in my area of the press section. It was a quick right hand that caught Liston as he was coming forward ... According to ringside doctors I&#x27;ve spoken to, that is a classic example of a medulla oblongata K.O.&quot; World Light Heavyweight Champion José Torres said, &quot;It was a perfect punch.&quot; Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;no phantom punch&quot;. Tex Maule of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote, &quot;The blow had so much force it lifted Liston&#x27;s left foot, upon which most of his weight was resting, well off the canvas.&quot;

&quot;Many people in the arena did not see [the punch], understandably&quot;, Merchant wrote: &quot;Or they couldn&#x27;t believe that it had the force to knock out the seemingly indestructible former champion&quot;. He described the belief that the fight was rigged as &quot;the apparently unkillable myth ... many people believe that the moon landings were staged, probably right there in Lewiston&quot;. Slow motion examination of the fight recording shows that the &#x27;punch&#x27; that landed was a short grazing right to Liston&#x27;s cheek and of apparently limited power. Hall of Fame announcer Don Dunphy was one of many who didn&#x27;t believe the fight was on the level. &quot;If that was a punch, I&#x27;ll eat it,&quot; he said. &quot;Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards [used] to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn&#x27;t knock him down.&quot; But others contend that he wasn&#x27;t the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the &quot;New York Times&quot; said Liston &quot;looked awful&quot; in his last workout before the fight. Liston&#x27;s handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 to take it easy on him. Arthur Daley of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that Liston&#x27;s handlers knew he &quot;didn&#x27;t have it anymore&quot;. These statements do not accord with the fact that three years later Liston easily knocked out Lincoln within two rounds.

One ringside observer, former World Heavyweight Champion James J. Braddock, said the suspect Ali right hand merely finished up what an earlier punch had begun. &quot;I have a feeling that this guy (Ali) is a lot better than any of us gave him credit for,&quot; Braddock said. &quot;It isn&#x27;t the knockout punch that sticks in my mind as much as a punch he let go (earlier). ... It was a right to Liston&#x27;s jaw and it shook him to his shoetops. For all we know, it could have been the one that set up the knockout.&quot;

Another former champion, Rocky Marciano, changed his view about the knockout punch after seeing videotape the next day. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it was a powerful punch when I saw the fight from ringside,&quot; Marciano said. &quot;Now (after seeing video) I think Clay, seeing the opening, snapped the punch the last six inches.&quot; He added that he still didn&#x27;t think it was a knockout punch.

Ali did not think he knocked Liston out. In his own words in Thomas Hauser&#x27;s 1991 biography: &quot;The punch jarred him. It was a good punch, but I didn&#x27;t think I hit him so hard that he couldn&#x27;t have gotten up. Once he went down, I got excited. I forgot about the rules&quot;. In that same book, Liston, quoted two years after the fight: &quot;Ali knocked me down with a sharp punch. I was down but not hurt, but I looked up and saw Ali standing over me. ... Ali is waiting to hit me, the ref can&#x27;t control him&quot;.

Dave Anderson said he saw Liston in Las Vegas in 1967 and asked him what happened. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that hard a punch, but it partially caught me off balance and when I got knocked down, I got mixed up because the referee never gave me a count,&quot; Liston said. &quot;I was listening for a count. That&#x27;s the first thing you do, but I never heard a count because Clay never went to a neutral corner.&quot;

Jerry Izenberg of the Newark &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; said Liston told him that he lost simply because &quot;the timekeeper couldn&#x27;t count&quot;.

Mark Kram of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said Liston told him: &quot;That guy [Ali] was crazy. I didn&#x27;t want anything to do with him. And the Muslims were coming up. Who needed that? So I went down. I wasn&#x27;t hit.&quot;

Wilfred Sheed offered his opinion in his 1975 book, &quot;Muhammad Ali: A Portrait in Words and Photographs&quot;, writing that Liston was going to throw the fight going in and, when he suffered a legitimate flash knockdown in round one, decided on the spot to seize the opportunity and end the fight. It was Walcott&#x27;s confusion and Ali&#x27;s behavior that forced Liston to feign disorientation for far longer than a knockdown of that type would have caused.

During a 1995 HBO documentary about Liston, Johnny Tocco, who owned a boxing gym in Las Vegas, said he spoke with mobster John Vitale before the rematch and was told not to pay any attention to what he heard about the fight. He also told Tocco that he should be glad that he was not going to Lewiston. When Tocco asked why, Vitale told him that the fight was going to end in the first round.

During the same documentary, former FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr. said, &quot;We learned that there very definitely had been a fix in that fight.&quot; He said Bernie Glickman, a boxing manager from Chicago with mob ties, claimed that while he was conversing with Liston and his wife before the fight, Liston&#x27;s wife told the ex-champion that as long as he had to lose the fight, he should go down early to avoid any chance of getting hurt.
In the wake of the controversial fight, there was an outcry by press and politicians for the abolition of boxing. Bills to ban the sport were planned in several state legislatures.

A promoter in San Antonio apologized to his theater TV customers and, on the basis that they had been defrauded by a &quot;shameful spectacle&quot;, donated his take to boys&#x27; clubs. The California legislature, in session, received a resolution calling for an investigation by the state attorney general to determine if its closed-circuit viewers had been fraudulently duped out of their money.

For those who believe that Liston took a dive, there are a number of theories as to why, including:
* The Mafia forced Liston to throw the fight as part of a betting coup.
* Liston bet against himself and took a dive because he owed money to the Mafia.
* A couple of members of the Nation of Islam visited Liston&#x27;s training camp and told Liston they would kill him if he won the rematch.
* Author Paul Gallender claims that members of the Nation of Islam kidnapped Liston&#x27;s wife, Geraldine, and Liston&#x27;s son, Bobby. Liston was told to lose the fight to Ali or he would never see his family again.
* Liston was afraid that he would be accidentally shot by followers of Malcolm X as they tried to kill Ali in the ring. There were also claims attributed to Liston and others that he threw the fight in return for a share of the more marketable Ali&#x27;s future purses. Credence to these claims is provided by the fact that after his last fight, with Chuck Wepner, Liston seemed more preoccupied in supporting the proposed Ali-Frazier bout and Ali&#x27;s claims to the title than about his own career.

In the final analysis, it remains inconclusive whether the blow in Lewiston was a genuine knockout punch. The fact that Liston did not complain about the clear breach of boxing rules (being declared knocked out without a count) and Ali&#x27;s obvious state of bewilderment, shouting at Liston &quot;Nobody will believe this&quot; and asking his handlers &quot;Did I hit him?&quot; is viewed as confirmation for most people&#x27;s belief that Liston took a dive.

==Legacy==
The two bouts launched one man and ruined the other.

The fight contributed to the Ali mystique of beating seemingly insurmountable foes. For Liston, the fights left his reputation in tatters. In just a little over one year, he went from being considered one of the most fearsome heavyweights of all-time to an overrated champion. &quot;[After the two Ali fights] Liston would never again intimidate a world-class fighter,&quot; wrote Bob Mee, &quot;and therefore would never again be the fighter he used to be.&quot; Worse, his quick loss in the second fight created suspicion of corruption.

In reality, Liston was still a formidable fighter and highly ranked contender at the end of his career, having won 15 of his last 16 bouts, 14 by knockout.

BoxRec ranks Liston as among the 10 best heavyweights in the world in 15 different years (1954–1956 and 1958–1969), placing him at No.1 from 1958 to 1962 and the fourth greatest of all time. &quot;Ring&quot; magazine ranked him as the tenth greatest heavyweight of all time, while boxing writer Herb Goldman ranked him second and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; placed him third. Alfie Potts Harmer in &quot;The Sportster&quot; ranked him the sixth greatest boxer of all time, pound for pound. In his book, &quot;The Gods of War&quot;, Springs Toledo argued that Liston, when at his peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, could be favored to beat just about every heavyweight champion in the modern era with the possible exception of Muhammad Ali. This view is shared by boxing writer Frank Lotierzo who ranks Liston as one of the top 5 heavyweights of all time and possibly the best. Liston and Ali were both inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Ali, in his autobiography, stated that in his prime the only two boxers who would have caused him serious trouble were &quot;Ezzard Charles and a young Sonny Liston&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Calypsonian Lord Melody recorded a song entitled &quot;Clay Vs Liston&quot;, which was released as a single in 1965. The song&#x27;s lyrics deal with the first fight between the two. The song appeared on the 1994 CD compilation &quot;Precious Melodies&quot;.

&quot;Ali&quot;, a film by director Michael Mann, was released in 2001. Will Smith was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Ali. Former boxer Michael Bentt played Liston.

Robert Townsend directed a 2008 film about Liston entitled &quot;Phantom Punch&quot;. Ving Rhames starred as Liston, and Andrew Hinkson portrayed Ali.

A wax model of Liston appears in the front row of the iconic sleeve cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. He is seen in the far left part of the row, wearing a white and gold robe, standing beside the original-look Beatles wax figures.

As a homage to Sonny Liston, a bronze copy of a marble statue made by Alfred Hrdlicka in 1963/64 was put up in 2008 between Old Castle and Karlsplatz in downtown Stuttgart, Germany.

In &quot;NCIS&quot;, director Leon Vance, a former boxer, has a framed photo in his office of Ali gloating over the floored Liston at the end of the second fight. In &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;, he discusses the photo with Gibbs and mentions the fixing allegations.

A play entitled &quot;One Night in Miami&quot; opened in 2013. It tells the story of the night Ali—then Cassius Clay—beat Liston to take the World Heavyweight Championship. It takes place in a hotel room after the fight where Clay, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X talk about their lives and their hopes for the future. A film adaptation of the play was released in 2020.

The &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode &quot;The Suitcase&quot; from Season 4 revolves around the second fight, with Don Draper creating a commercial inspired by the famous photo.

<text>The Nissan FM platform is a FR automobile layout. The name is derived from the &quot;front midships&quot; location of the engine, with its center of mass located behind the front axle centerline, shifting weight to the middle of the car, leaving the front suspension less encumbered. The engine is pushed as far back to the firewall as possible, creating a weight distribution close to 50:50 and enabling the front wheels to be placed close to the corners for better handling. This platform debuted with the 2001 V35-series Infiniti G-series/Nissan Skyline, and was then used as the basis of nearly all of Nissan&#x27;s rear and all-wheel drive applications. The platform was revised for use in the JDM Nissan Fuga/USDM Infiniti M35/45, being stretched in wheelbase and reinforced for additional torsional rigidity, a version referred to as the &quot;enhanced FM&quot; platform. The GT-R is built on Nissan&#x27;s Premium Midship (PM) platform, an evolution of the Front Midship (FM) architecture.

<doc id="851730" wikidata="Q7346341" url="?curid=851730" title="Rob Key">
<text>Robert William Trevor Key (born 12 May 1979) is an English former cricketer and cricket commentator who played international cricket in all formats for England and domestic cricket for Kent County Cricket Club. He is the current managing director of the England Cricket team.

A right-handed opening batsman, Key made appearances at age-group level for Kent from the age of eleven, moving up until he made his first-class debut in 1998. He made eight first-class and four List A appearances for England&#x27;s youth sides, and was a member of the side that won the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Following a season of heavy run-scoring, Key was called up to the England A side in 1999.

Following an injury to Marcus Trescothick, Key made his Test debut against India in 2002. He toured Australia during the 2002–03 Ashes series, where he justified his selection ahead of a more experienced player. His One Day International debut came in 2003, against Zimbabwe, however he was dropped from both squads shortly after. Injury to Mark Butcher allowed Key back into the England side for the series against the West Indies in 2004. He scored his maiden Test hundred in the first match of the series, which later became his maiden first-class double century as he scored 221. This performance, coupled with the 93 he scored in the third Test, earned him recognition as one of the five &quot;Wisden&quot; Cricketers of the Year. Key&#x27;s last Test matches came during England&#x27;s tour of South Africa during 2004–05, where he managed to score 152 runs without being consistent, and despite a one-match return during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, he has remained on the fringes of selection.

Key became Kent captain following the 2006 English cricket season, following David Fulton&#x27;s resignation. He led Kent to a County Championship 2nd Division Championship title in 2010, two Twenty20 Cup Finals Day appearances and a Friends Provident Trophy final. He resigned as Kent captain following the 2012 English cricket season and James Tredwell became club captain. Key only had one season off as captain as Tredwell then himself resigned and Key was named as his replacement, captaining the county for another two years until the end of the 2015 season.

In April 2016, Key announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Key was a regular commentator on Sky Sports&#x27; TV coverage of county cricket while still a player at Kent, and after retiring he worked as a pundit and commentator for a variety of media outlets, including GTV and SEN. On 17 April 2022, he was appointed as the managing director of the England men&#x27;s cricket team, stepping down from all of his media commitments.

==Early and personal life==
Born in East Dulwich, London, to parents Trevor and Lynn, Key was raised in a particularly sporting family: his mother played for Kent&#x27;s ladies cricket side, his father played club cricket in Derby and his sister Elizabeth played for her junior school side, where she once took a hat-trick. Key himself was a keen all-round sportsman; he also played tennis for Kent.

He attended Worsley Bridge Primary School where the school won both the Bromley area and Kent cricket Cups. His performances led to his inclusion in the county under-elevens, before Alan Ealham, coach of Kent County Cricket Club&#x27;s youth sides, became his mentor. Later he attended Colfe&#x27;s School in Lee, London, and Langley Park School for Boys in Beckenham, where he passed ten GCSEs.

Key has often been criticized for his weight, and at one stage early in his career weighed 16 stone before Alec Stewart told him to &quot;buck his ideas up&quot;. Key himself said of the matter: &quot;I&#x27;ll never be the most athletic-looking bloke, but I&#x27;m a hell of a lot fitter than I was at 19 or 20.&quot;

Key is married to Fleur, with whom he has two children.

==Youth and early career==
Key played his first matches for Kent&#x27;s second eleven in 1995, at the age of sixteen. He remained a regular in the second team throughout the 1996 season and first half of the 1997 season, by which time he had hit his first two centuries for a Kent representative side; an unbeaten 146 against Essex&#x27;s second team, and an unbeaten 139 against Glamorgan&#x27;s seconds.

Following on from those performances, Key joined the England Under-17 squad for the International Youth Tournament, which was being held in Bermuda. Key&#x27;s growing reputation as a batsman was greatly enhanced by his performances in this tournament, where he finished with the second highest batting average of anyone at the tournament, scoring 184 runs at an average of 48. Key&#x27;s performances helped England win the tournament by a single point from Ireland&#x27;s Under-17s.

Key returned to England for two matches with Kent&#x27;s second team, before joining up with England&#x27;s Under-19s for a youth Test series against Zimbabwe&#x27;s under-19s. In the three Test series, Key made two half-centuries, earning himself a place in the squad for the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Batting at the top of the order throughout, Key scored a total of 206 runs as England won the tournament, with his best performance coming in the defeat to India, where Key scored 57.

Following a first-class debut against Middlesex at the beginning of the 1998 season, in which Key scored 15, he proceeded to play a near-complete season. He scored his first first-class century against Durham, scoring 101 in an innings victory. He added a second century (115) against Nottinghamshire, before rejoining the England under-19 squad for the series against Pakistan under-19s. He struggled in the one-day series, scoring just 36 runs in three matches, but finished as the top run-scorer in the youth Tests; with 377 at an average of 62.83.

==Domestic career==

The 1999 season began for Key with a call up to England A&#x27;s tour of Zimbabwe through January and February. He struggled for runs throughout his five matches on the tour, failing to pass 26 in any innings. In all, Key managed one century in the calendar year, 125 against Somerset, and finished the year with 1,309 runs in all competitions. The 2000 season proved even more disappointing, with just 700 runs at an average of less than 20.

The 2001 English cricket season saw Key&#x27;s form improve, with him scoring four first-class centuries; including one against the touring Pakistanis. His highest score of the season and career to date would come in the final game—he scored 132 in a rain-affected match against Lancashire. His scoring throughout the season persuaded the national selectors to include him in the National Academy, which went on a winter tour of Australia, where he showed his ability with an innings of 177 against the side&#x27;s Australian counterparts.

He continued his good form into 2002, where his run-scoring earned him an invitation to play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans. He scored 77 in a drawn match, and would later that season make his Test match debut against India. However, following his Test debut, he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year. He would maintain his place in the Test side against Zimbabwe the following year, despite only scoring one innings of note—129 against the Cambridge students. However, after being dropped from the side, Key&#x27;s form seemed to improve: he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory, and consistently scored around 40 runs per innings for the remainder of the season.

The 2004 English cricket season saw Key hit top form for the first time, scoring a total of 2,486 runs in all competitions. This total included a &quot;majestic&quot; unbeaten 118 in the opening game of the season against Gloucestershire, during which Key did not offer a single chance throughout. He reached the thousand run milestone for the season on 2 June, the earliest date the milestone had been reached since 1978, and went on a run that included five centuries in seven innings. He was then recalled to the England squad for the series against the West Indies, and Key played two key innings: 221 at Lord&#x27;s, and his second innings 93 not out to win the third Test for England. Following the series Key returned to the domestic scene, and finished the season with two further tons; 131 against both Northamptonshire and Middlesex.

Following the winter international series in South Africa, Key returned to domestic action with Kent. While not having as successful a season as in the previous year, he still scored over 1,500 runs. This included two centuries in the same match against Surrey, during the second of which he shared a county third-wicket record partnership of 323 with Martin van Jaarsveld. At the end of the season, Key was named the new county captain following the resignation of David Fulton, a role he took on in order to help his chances of regaining a place in the England side.

His first season as captain saw his form slide, as Kent&#x27;s chairman of cricket Graham Johnson related at the end of the season: &quot;His commitment to the team has probably impacted on his own form&quot;. Nonetheless, he was given the captaincy of the England A team in their fixture against Pakistan, and led Kent to fifth place in the top tier of the County Championship. The following season saw Key lead Kent to silverware, whilst returning to some of his best form. He struck a total of eight centuries, and amassed a total of 2,267 runs in all competitions, whilst also leading Kent to the finals day of the 2007 Twenty20 Cup, in which Kent defeated Sussex and Gloucestershire to claim the trophy. However, Key was later found guilty of &quot;serious dissent&quot; following his controversial dismissal in the final.

He continued his run-scoring into 2008, where he scored an unbeaten 178 against the touring New Zealanders to &quot;lift himself firmly into the Test reckoning&quot;. Following Michael Vaughan&#x27;s resignation as England captain, Key was touted by the some in the media as a potential candidate for the job. However, the season ended badly for Key, as under his captaincy Kent were relegated to the second tier of the County Championship for the first time, with Key also being fined £1,250 for comments he made over an ECB pitch panel decision in August.

Key took his first wicket in first-class cricket on the final day of Kent&#x27;s draw with Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season. He went on to score 1,209 runs that season, with four centuries including a career-best 270*, at 50.37 runs per innings. It was the sixth time he had passed one thousand runs in a season. He came close to beating this score the following season when, on 17 May 2010, he scored 261 against Durham. He had, until that match, struggled with the bat—averaging only 14.30 in the County Championship.

He announced his retirement from the game on 18 April 2016, citing his desire to not &quot;hinder younger players [coming through]&quot; and focus on coaching and his role with Sky Sports as a television pundit.

==International career==

===India in England, 2002===

Key made his Test match debut in the second Test against India in 2002, as a replacement for Marcus Trescothick, who had broken his thumb. Chairman of selectors David Graveney said Key was selected because of his &quot;outstanding form for Kent after attending the National Academy&quot; over the winter. Opening the batting with Michael Vaughan, Key made 17 runs in his only innings before being bowled by Ashish Nehra. Retained in the side for the third Test, Key managed scores of 30 and 34 as England succumbed to an innings defeat. However, his performance was marred by him dropping three catches. Key was dropped from the fourth and final Test, with Trescothick replacing him having been rushed back from injury.

===England in Australia, 2002–03===

After success in domestic cricket and promise shown in his Test appearances previously, Key was selected as part of the squad to play Australia. Despite playing well in a limited overs match against an ACB Chairman&#x27;s XI; hitting 68, he was not selected to play in the first Test, instead acting as twelfth man. He ended up fielding to a greater extent than he would have imagined, after Simon Jones ruptured knee ligaments while fielding, and took no further part in the match.

Brought back into the side for the second Test for the injured John Crawley, Key made a solitary run in the first innings, batting at number three, before being caught off the bowling of Shane Warne just after the lunch break. Relegated to number five in the second innings, with Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain batting ahead of him, he again made just one before being caught off Andy Bichel.

Key fared better in the third match, played at the WACA Ground in Perth. On a pitch with &quot;exceptional bounce and pace&quot;, Key was the only English batsman to keep his wicket intact for a prolonged period, batting passively for 47, the highest score of the innings. He then caught Brett Lee at third man in Australia&#x27;s only innings, before offering Hussain &quot;stout support&quot; in making 23 second time around. England lost the Test match by an innings and 48 runs, a result that ensured that Australia retained the Ashes.

Following a break for the first part of the VB Series of One Day Internationals, England moved to Melbourne for the fourth Test. Unfortunately for Key, he fell for a duck in the first innings, trapped leg before wicket (lbw) second ball by fast bowler Brett Lee. With England following on, Key made a maiden half-century to ensure Australia had to bat again. He eventually fell just after the new ball was taken, caught at second slip for 52.

The final Test, played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, saw England attempting to avoid a series whitewash. Key scored three runs in England&#x27;s first innings, before falling lbw to an innocuous half-volley from Steve Waugh, playing in his last Ashes Test. He scored 14 in his final innings of the tour, before being caught at midwicket, however England had nearly 350 runs on the board by that stage and were on track to complete a consolatory victory. The 2004 edition of the Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack recorded that Key had &quot;justified his selection ahead of an older player, like Mark Ramprakash, but did not cement his place&quot;.

===Zimbabwe and South Africa in England, 2003===

Despite a low-scoring start to the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept his place in the Test side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make much of an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissal—umpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.

His inclusion in the One Day International (ODI) squad for the following NatWest Series against Zimbabwe and South Africa owed more to the lack of available players than his own form; he had only passed 40 on one occasion going into the series. Key made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the opening match of the tournament; he scored 11 before falling to the left-arm spin of Ray Price. Key only played one more match in the series; against South Africa he fell for a golden duck taking a &quot;wild swing&quot; at the first ball he received from Makhaya Ntini. Following England&#x27;s qualification into the final of the tournament, Key was released from the squad &quot;to have some match-practice in the longer form of the game ahead of the Test series&quot; against South Africa. However, Key did not make an appearance in the series.

===West Indies in England, 2004===

Key returned to the Test match side after an excellent start to the 2004 season. He reached 1,000 runs for the season by 2 June, the earliest date the milestone had been reached for 16 years, and had a run of five centuries in seven innings. However, his limited-overs form was not as good—he passed fifty only once all season. Despite this, he was called into the squad for the NatWest Series against the West Indies and New Zealand.

Key&#x27;s series began with the fifth match of the tournament; against the West Indies at Headingley. With England chasing 160 to win, Key came in at 55 for one, but scored just six before being bowled by Dwayne Bravo. His only other appearance came against New Zealand towards the end of the group stage—Key scored 18 and was playing well before being caught behind.

His place in the Test side was ensured after Mark Butcher pulled out, having been hit from behind in his car and sustaining a whiplash injury. Key took the opportunity, moving toward a maiden Test century with what &quot;Wisden&quot; described as &quot;powerful driving and pulling&quot;. He was dropped twice—Chris Gayle parried an opportunity with Key on 16, while Devon Smith failed to dismiss him when on 58. Key maintained his concentration throughout, even after meeting the Queen in a presentation during the tea interval. He brought up his century with a boundary off the bowling of Fidel Edwards, and by the end of the first day had reached 167 not out. He continued positively on the second day, and brought up his maiden double century with four through square leg off Pedro Collins. He was eventually dismissed when he &quot;slashed a wide ball to Brian Lara at backward point&quot;, having made 221. In the second innings, he was run out by his captain Michael Vaughan, who went on to score his second century of the match.

The second Test saw Key struggling in the corridor of uncertainty, a characteristic highlighted by Collins, who beat the bat on several occasions before finding the edge to dismiss him. His second innings lasted just seven balls before Key &quot;chipped a simple catch to mid-on&quot;, having scored just four.

Key&#x27;s most valuable innings, according to &quot;Wisden&quot;, came in the third Test. Despite only scoring six runs in the first innings, Key came to the crease for his second innings with England requiring another 216 runs to take a 3–0 lead in the series. Initially batting with Michael Vaughan, and then with Andrew Flintoff, Key scored an unbeaten 93 to guide England to their target, which was a record fourth innings total to win an Old Trafford Test. His series came to an end when he scored ten runs, in England&#x27;s ten-wicket victory in the final Test.

Key&#x27;s performances in the series and his domestic form earned him recognition—he was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 2005 edition.

===England in South Africa, 2004–05===
Following on from his performances during the series against the West Indies, Key was taken on England&#x27;s tour of South Africa over the English close-season. However, with Mark Butcher returning to the side following injury, Key lost his place. This was despite him scoring 87 in a warm-up game against a Nicky Oppenheimer XI, a match in which Butcher had scored just six. Returning to the side for the third Test after Butcher had sustained a wrist injury, Key made a duck in the first innings, before &quot;defending resolutely&quot; in accumulating 41 before being stumped charging Nicky Boje.

The fourth Test, played at the Wanderers, saw Key hit 83, in a partnership of 182 with Andrew Strauss that &quot;Wisden&quot; described as including &quot;hard-hitting support from Key&quot;. He added a further eighteen to his match tally in the second innings, a contribution which helped England to an eventual victory. Key returned single figure scores of one and nine in his two innings in the final Test, being dismissed by Shaun Pollock on both occasions in a rain-affected draw.

===ICC World Twenty20===

Key briefly returned to international cricket for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 competition, playing his only Twenty20 International match against the Netherlands during the tournament as a replacement for the injured Kevin Pietersen. He scored 10 not out from eight balls in a match where the Netherlands successfully chased their target from the final ball.

<text>The Business is a novel by the Scottish writer Iain Banks, published in 1999.

==Plot introduction==
Kate Telman is a &#x27;level 3&#x27; executive in the Business, a vast business empire. During her sabbatical year, she comes to suspect that some of her colleagues are stealing from the organisation, and investigates.

==Plot summary==
The book starts with a 4:37 a.m. phone call from Mike Daniels to Kathryn (Kate) Telman. He has been drugged, and about half of his teeth randomly and expertly extracted, just before an important meeting in Japan.

The Business is a powerful (yet democratic) multinational commercial organisation, secretive (but not too sinisterly so), and very long-lived. It predates the Roman Catholic Church, and descends from a consortium of merchants in the Roman Empire which it even owned for sixty-six days (it hired a man to become emperor, but he lasted less than a month before being assassinated; a reference to the emperor Didius Julianus). It is now considering taking over a country in order to gain a seat at the United Nations.

The story follows the heroine, Kate Telman, who is 38 and lusts after Stephen Buzetski, who is married. Starting from poverty, she has risen through the Business under the tutelage of her mentor, who adopted her at an early age, and her &#x27;uncle Freddy&#x27;, the man who invented the portable milk container (named the &quot;chilp&quot;).

She is investigating a possible case of someone stealing from the company, starting with strange happenings at a silicon chip manufacturing plant. Although she discovers evidence of wrongdoing at a high level in the Business, she continues to believe in what they are doing as an organisation.

She travels the world, at one point being summoned by a weapon-collecting higher-up in Nebraska to talk his nephew out of writing an incendiary anti-Islamic screenplay. A scene of the book takes place on a ship on its way to be broken up at a shipyard in Sonmiani Bay. She has several telephone conversations with her therapy-damaged friend Luce in California, who provides a cynical, suspicious, foul-mouthed counterpoint to Kate&#x27;s goodheartedness. She is given a DVD of Stephen&#x27;s wife having extramarital sex in an attempt to influence her.

She also becomes involved in the acquisition of the small Himalayan country of Thulahn. Small and underdeveloped, bleak and vulnerable, the football pitch doubles as the airport, &quot;the royal palace is heated by yak dung&quot; and the &quot;national sport is emigration&quot;. It resembles an exaggerated version of Bhutan.

Under the Business&#x27;s plan, Thulahn would be utterly changed, if not destroyed, and its people thrust into the modern world. Kate is given the job of negotiating with Thulahn&#x27;s crown prince Suvinder Dzung, who when he last met her had fallen in love with her.
